It will be observed that      most of the conditions mentioned are such as would be favorable      to excitations of an emotionally sexual character.        The palms of the hands may be very ticklish during sexual      excitement, especially in women, and Moll (_Kontraere      Sexualempfindung_, p. 180) remarks that in some men titillation      of the skin of the back, of the feet, and even of the forehead      evokes erotic feelings.        It may be added that, as might be expected, titillation of the      skin often has the same significance in animals as in man. \"In      some animals,\" remarks Louis Robinson (art. \"Ticklishness,\"      _Dictionary of Psychological Medicine_), \"local titillation of      the skin, though in parts remote from the reproductive organs,      plainly acts indirectly upon them as a stimulus. Thus, Harvey      records that, by stroking the back of a favorite parrot (which he      had possessed for years and supposed to be a male), he not only      gave the bird gratification,--which was the sole intention of the      illustrious physiologist,--but also caused it to reveal its sex      by laying an egg.\"    The sexual significance of tickling is very clearly indicated by the fact  that the general ticklishness of the body, which is so marked in children  and in young girls, greatly diminishes, as a rule, after sexual  relationships have been established. Dr. Gina Lombroso, who investigated  the cutaneous reflexes, found that both the abdominal and plantar  reflexes, which are well marked in childhood and in young people between  the ages of 15 and 18, were much diminished in older persons, and to a  greater extent in women than in men, to a greater extent in the abdominal  region than on the soles of the feet;[16] her results do not directly show  the influence of sexual relationship, but they have an indirect bearing  which is worth noting.    The difference in ticklishness between the unmarried woman and the married  woman corresponds to their difference in degree of modesty. Both modesty  and ticklishness may be said to be characters which are no longer needed.  From this point of view the general ticklishness of the skin is a kind of  body modesty. It is so even apart from any sexual significance of  tickling, and Louis Robinson has pointed out that in young apes, puppies,  and other like animals the most ticklish regions correspond to the most  vulnerable spots in a fight, and that consequently in the mock fights of  early life skill in defending these spots is attained.        In Iceland, according to Margarethe Filhes (as quoted by Max      Bartels, _Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1900, ht. 2-3, p. 57), it      may be known whether a youth is pure or a maid is intact by their      susceptibility to tickling. It is considered a bad sign if that      is lost.        I am indebted to a medical correspondent for the following      communication: \"Married women have told me that they find that      after marriage they are not ticklish under the arms or on the      breasts, though before marriage any tickling or touching in these      regions, especially by a man, would make them jump or get      hysterical or 'queer,' as they call it. Before coitus the sexual      energy seems to be dissipated along all the nerve-channels and      especially along the secondary sexual routes,--the breasts, nape      of neck, eyebrows, lips, cheeks, armpits, and hair thereon,      etc.,--but after marriage the surplus energy is diverted from      these secondary channels, and response to tickling is diminished.      I have often noted in insane cases, especially mania in      adolescent girls, that they are excessively ticklish. Again, in      ordinary routine practice I have observed that, though married      women show no ticklishness during auscultation and percussion of      the chest, this is by no means always so in young girls. Perhaps      ticklishness in virgins is Nature's self-protection against rape      and sexual advances, and the young girl instinctively wishing to      hide the armpits, breasts, and other ticklish regions, tucks      herself up to prevent these parts being touched. The married      woman, being in love with a man, does not shut up these parts, as      she reciprocates the advances that he makes; she no longer      requires ticklishness as a protection against sexual aggression.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [5] Alrutz's views are summarized in _Psychological Review_, Sept., 1901.

We have seen that the skin generally has a high degree of sensibility,  which frequently tends to be in more or less definite association with the  sexual centres. We have seen also that the central and specific sexual  sensation, the sexual embrace itself, is, in large measure, a specialized  kind of skin reflex. Between the generalized skin sensations and the great  primary sexual centre of sensation there are certain secondary sexual  centres which, on account of their importance, may here be briefly  considered.    These secondary centres have in common the fact that they always involve  the entrances and the exits of the body--the regions, that is, where skin  merges into mucous membrane, and where, in the course of evolution,  tactile sensibility has become highly refined. It may, indeed, be said  generally of these frontier regions of the body that their contact with  the same or a similar frontier region in another person of opposite sex,  under conditions otherwise favorable to tumescence, will tend to produce a  minimum and even sometimes a maximum degree of sexual excitation. Contact  of these regions with each other or with the sexual region itself so  closely simulates the central sexual reflex that channels are set up for  the same nervous energy and secondary sexual centres are constituted.    It is important to remember that the phenomena we are here concerned with  are essentially normal. Many of them are commonly spoken of as  perversions. In so far, however, as they are aids to tumescence they must  be regarded as coming within the range of normal variation. They may be  considered unaesthetic, but that is another matter. It has, moreover, to be  remembered that aesthetic values are changed under the influence of sexual  emotion; from the lover's point of view many things are beautiful which  are unbeautiful from the point of view of him who is not a lover, and the  greater the degree to which the lover is swayed by his passion the greater  the extent to which his normal aesthetic standard is liable to be modified.  A broad consideration of the phenomena among civilized and uncivilized  peoples amply suffices to show the fallacy of the tendency, so common  among unscientific writers on these subjects, to introduce normal aesthetic  standards into the sexual sphere. From the normal standpoint of ordinary  daily life, indeed, the whole process of sex is unaesthetic, except the  earlier stages of tumescence.[17]    So long as they constitute a part of the phase of tumescence, the  utilization of the sexual excitations obtainable through these channels  must be considered within the normal range of variation, as we may  observe, indeed, among many animals. When, however, such contacts of the  orifices of the body, other than those of the male and female sexual  organs proper, are used to procure not merely tumescence, but  detumescence, they become, in the strict and technical sense, perversions.  They are perversions in exactly the same sense as are the methods of  intercourse which involve the use of checks to prevent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#6)"],[1,"Europeans generally), until she finally left him. (_Archives de      Neurologie_, October, 1904.)        Probably the first case of shoe-fetichism ever recorded in any      detail is that of Restif de la Bretonne (1734-1806), publicist      and novelist, one of the most remarkable literary figures of the      later eighteenth century in France. Restif was a neurotic      subject, though not to an extreme degree, and his shoe-fetichism,      though distinctly pronounced, was not pathological; that is to      say, that the shoe was not itself an adequate gratification of      the sexual impulse, but simply a highly important aid to      tumescence, a prelude to the natural climax of detumescence; only      occasionally, and _faute de mieux_, in the absence of the beloved      person, was the shoe used as an adjunct to masturbation. In      Restif's stories and elsewhere the attraction of the shoe is      frequently discussed or used as a motive. His first decided      literary success, _Le Pied de Fanchette_, was suggested by a      vision of a girl with a charming foot, casually seen in the      street. While all such passages in his books are really founded      on his own personal feelings and experiences, in his elaborate      autobiography, _Monsieur Nicolas_, he has frankly set forth the      gradual evolution and cause of his idiosyncrasy. The first      remembered trace dated from the age of 4, when he was able to      recall having remarked the feet of a young girl in his native      place. Restif was a sexually precocious youth, and at the age of      9, though both delicate in health and shy in manners, his      thoughts were already absorbed in the girls around him. \"While      little Monsieur Nicolas,\" he tells us, \"passed for a Narcissus,      his thoughts, as soon as he was alone, by night or by day, had no      other object than that sex he seemed to flee from. The girls most      careful of their persons were naturally those who pleased him      most, and as the part least easy to keep clean is that which      touches the earth it was to the foot-gear that he mechanically      gave his chief attention. Agathe, Reine, and especially      Madeleine, were the most elegant of the girls at that time; their      carefully selected and kept shoes, instead of laces or buckles,      which were not yet worn at Sacy, had blue or rose ribbon,      according to the color of the skirt. I thought of these girls      with emotion; I desired--I knew not what; but I desired      something, if it were only to subdue them.\" The origin Restif      here assigns to his shoe-fetichism may seem paradoxical; he      admired the girls who were most clean and neat in their dress, he      tells us, and, therefore, paid most attention to that part of      their clothing which was least clean and neat. But, however      paradoxical the remark may seem, it is psychologically sound. All      fetichism is a kind of not necessarily morbid obsession, and as      the careful work of Janet and others in that field has shown, an      obsession is a fascinated attraction to some object or idea      which gives the subject a kind of emotional shock by its      contrast to his habitual moods or ideas. The ordinary morbid      obsession cannot usually be harmoniously co-ordinated with the      other experiences of the subject's daily life, and shows,      therefore, no tendency to become pleasurable. Sexual fetichisms,      on the other hand, have a reservoir of agreeable emotion to draw      on, and are thus able to acquire both stability and harmony. It      will also be seen that no element of masochism is involved in      Restif's fetichism, though the mistake has been frequently made      of supposing that these two manifestations are usually or even      necessarily allied. Restif wishes to subject the girl who      attracts him, he has no wish to be subjected by her. He was      especially dazzled by a young girl from another town, whose shoes      were of a fashionable cut, with buckles, \"and who was a charming      person besides.\" She was delicate as a fairy, and rendered his      thoughts unfaithful to the robust beauties of his native Sacy.      \"No doubt,\" he remarks, \"because, being frail and weak myself, it      seemed to me that it would be easier to subdue her.\" \"This taste      for the beauty of the feet,\" he continues, \"was so powerful in me      that it unfailingly aroused desire and would have made me      overlook ugliness. It is excessive in all those who have it.\" He      admired the foot as well as the shoe: \"The factitious taste for      the shoe is only a reflection of that for pretty feet. When I      entered a house and saw the boots arranged in a row, as is the      custom, I would tremble with pleasure; I blushed and lowered my      eyes as if in the presence of the girls themselves. With this      vivacity of feeling and a voluptuousness of ideas inconceivable      at the age of 10 I still fled, with an involuntary impulse of      modesty, from the girls I adored.\"        We may clearly see how this combination of sensitive and      precocious sexual ardor with extreme shyness, furnished the soil      on which the germ of shoe-fetichism was able to gain a firm root      and persist in some degree throughout a long life very largely      given up to a pursuit of women, abnormal rather by its      excessiveness than its perversity. A few years later, he tells      us, he happened to see a pretty pair of shoes in a bootmaker's      shop, and on hearing that they belonged to a girl whom at that      time he reverently adored at a distance he blushed and nearly      fainted.        In 1749 he was for a time attracted to a young woman very much      older than himself; he secretly carried away one of her slippers      and kept it for a day; a little later he again took away a shoe      of the same woman which had fascinated him when on her foot, and,      he seems to imply, he used it to masturbate with.        Perhaps the chief passion of Restif's life was his love for      Colette Parangon. He was still a boy (1752), she was the young      and virtuous wife of the printer whose apprentice Restif was and      in whose house he lived. Madame Parangon, a charming woman, as      she is described, was not happily married, and she evidently      felt a tender affection for the boy whose excessive love and      reverence for her were not always successfully concealed.      \"Madonna Parangon,\" he tells us, \"possessed a charm which I could      never resist, a pretty little foot; it is a charm which arouses      more than tenderness. Her shoes, made in Paris, had that      voluptuous elegance which seems to communicate soul and life.      Sometimes Colette wore shoes of simple white drugget or with      silver flowers; sometimes rose-colored slippers with green heels,      or green with rose heels; her supple feet, far from deforming her      shoes, increased their grace and rendered the form more      exciting.\" One day, on entering the house, he saw Madame Parangon      elegantly dressed and wearing rose-colored shoes with tongues,      and with green heels and a pretty rosette. They were new and she      took them off to put on green slippers with rose heels and      borders which he thought equally exciting. As soon as she had      left the room, he continues, \"carried away by the most impetuous      passion and idolizing Colette, I seemed to see her and touch her      in handling what she had just worn; my lips pressed one of these      jewels, while the other, deceiving the sacred end of nature, from      excess of exaltation replaced the object of sex (I cannot express      myself more clearly). The warmth which she had communicated to      the insensible object which had touched her still remained and      gave a soul to it; a voluptuous cloud covered my eyes.\" He adds      that he would kiss with rage and transport whatever had come in      close contact with the woman he adored, and on one occasion      eagerly pressed his lips to her cast-off underlinen, _vela      secretiora penetralium_.        At this period Restif's foot-fetichism reached its highest point      of development. It was the aberration of a highly sensitive and      very precocious boy. While the preoccupation with feet and shoes      persisted throughout life, it never became a complete perversion      and never replaced the normal end of sexual desire. His love for      Madam Parangon, one of the deepest emotions in his whole life,      was also the climax of his shoe-fetichism. She represented his      ideal woman, an ethereal sylph with wasp-waist and a child's      feet; it was always his highest praise for a woman that she      resembled Madame Parangon, and he desired that her slipper should      be buried with him. (Restif de la Bretonne, _Monsieur Nicolas_,      vols. i-iv, vol. xiii, p. 5; id., _Mes Inscriptions_, pp. ci-cv.)        Shoe-fetichism, more especially if we include under this term all      the cases of real or pseudo-masochism in which an attraction to      the boots or slippers is the chief feature, is a not infrequent      phenomenon, and is certainly the most frequently occurring form      of fetichism. Many cases are brought together by Krafft-Ebing in      his _Psychopathia Sexualis_. Every prostitute of any experience      has known men who merely desire to gaze at her shoes, or possibly      to lick them, and who are quite willing to pay for this      privilege. In London such a person is known as a \"bootman,\" in      Germany as a \"Stiefelfrier.\"    The predominance of the foot as a focus of sexual attraction, while among  us to-day it is a not uncommon phenomenon, is still not sufficiently  common to be called normal; the majority of even ardent lovers do not  experience this attraction in any marked degree. But these manifestations  of foot-fetichism which with us to-day are abnormal, even when they"]]]
