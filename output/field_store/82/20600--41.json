Conditions at Yuchi when we arrived were most unsettled and for some months  there had been a veritable \"reign of terror.\" A large band of brigands was  established in the hills not far from the city, and we were warned by the  mandarin not to attempt to go farther up the river. A few months earlier  several companies of soldiers had been sent from Foochow, and the result of  turning loose these ruffians upon the town was to make \"the remedy worse  than the disease.\"    The soldiers were continually arresting innocent peasants, accusing them of  being brigands or aiding the bandits, and shooting them without a hearing.  At one time accurate information concerning the camp of the robbers was  received and the soldiers set bravely off, but when within a short distance  of the brigands the commanders began to quarrel among themselves, guns were  fired, and the bandits escaped. A Chinaman must always \"save his face,\"  however, and when they returned to Yuchi they arrested dozens of people on  mere suspicion and executed them without the vestige of a trial. Finally  conditions became so intolerable that no one was safe, and after repeated  complaints by the missionaries, a new mandarin of a somewhat better type  was sent to Yuchi.    As it was impossible to do any collecting farther up the river because of  the bandits, we left for Yen-ping two days after arriving at Yuchi.  Yen-ping is a wonderfully picturesque old city, situated on a hill at a  fork of the river and surrounded by high stone walls pierced and  loopholed for rifle fire. Such walls, while of little use against  artillery, nevertheless offer a formidable obstacle to anything less than  field guns as we ourselves were destined to discover.    The Methodist mission compound encloses a considerable area on the very  summit of the hill, backed by the city wall, and besides the four dwelling  houses, comprises two large schools for boys and girls. Mr. Caldwell's  residence commands a wonderful view down the river and in the late  afternoon sunlight when the hills are bathed in pink and lavender and  purple a more beautiful spot can hardly be imagined.    But the delights of Yen-ping are somewhat tempered by the abominable  weather. In summer the heat is almost unbearable and the air is so nearly  saturated from continual rain that it is impossible to dry anything except  over a fire. From all reports winter must be almost as bad in the opposite  extreme for the cold is damp and penetrating; but the early fall is said to  be delightful.    The larger part of Fukien, like many other provinces in China, has been  denuded of forests, and the groves of pine which remain have all been  planted. This deforestation consequently has driven out the game, and  except for tigers, leopards, wolves, wild pigs, serows and gorals, none of  the large species is left. However, the dense growth of sword grass and the  thorny bushes which clothe the hills and choke the ravines give cover to  muntjac, or barking deer, and many species of small cats, civets, and other  Viverines. These animals come to the rice paddys, which fill every valley,  to hunt for frogs and fish, but it is difficult to catch them because of  the Chinese who are continually at work in the fields.    We spent a week trapping about Yen-ping and although we caught a good many  animals they were almost always stolen together with the traps. We had this  same difficulty in Yün-nan as well as in Fukien. None of us had ever seen  natives in any part of the world who were such unmitigated thieves as the  Chinese of these two provinces. The small mammals are hardly more abundant  than the larger ones for the natives wage an unceasing war on those about  the rice paddys and have exterminated nearly all but a few widely  distributed forms.          CHAPTER IV      A BAT CAVE IN THE BIG RAVINE    A few days after our arrival in Yen-ping we went with Mr. Caldwell and his  son Oliver to a Taoist temple seven miles away in a lonely ravine known as  Chi-yuen-kang. The walk to the temple in the early morning was delightful.  The \"bamboo chickens\" and francolins were calling all about us and on the  way we shot enough for our first day's dinner. Both these birds are  abundant in Fukien Province but it is by no means easy to kill them for  they live in such thick cover that they can only be flushed with  difficulty.    Early in the morning we frequently heard the francolins crowing in the  trees or on the top of a hill and when a cock had taken possession of such  a spot the intrusion of another was almost sure to cause trouble which only  ended when one of them had been driven off.    For two miles and a half the Big Ravine is a narrow cut between  perpendicular rock walls thickly clothed to their very summits with bamboo  and a tangle of thorny vines. In the bottom of the gorge a mountain torrent  foams among huge bowlders but becomes a gentle, slow moving stream when it  leaves the cool darkness of the cañon to spread itself over the terraced  rice fields.    About a mile from the entrance two old temples nestle into the hillside.  One stands just over the water, but the other clings to the rock wall three  hundred feet above the river, and it was there that we made our camp.    The old priest in charge did not appear especially delighted to see us  until I slipped a Mexican dollar into his hand--then it was laughable to  see his change of face. The far end of the balcony was given up to us while  Mr. Caldwell and Oliver put up their beds at the feet of a grinning idol in  the main temple.    We had come to Chi-yuen-kang to hunt serow (_see_ Chapter XVII) and had  brought with us only a few traps for small mammals. Harry had seen several  serow exhibited for sale on market days in towns along the river, and all  were reported to have been killed near this ravine. There was a village of  considerable size at the upper end and here we collected a motley lot of  beaters with half a dozen dogs to drive the top of a mountain which towered  about two thousand five hundred feet above the river.    Never will we forget that climb! We tried to start at daylight but it was  well toward six o'clock before we got our men together. A Chinaman would  drive an impatient man to apoplexy and an early grave for it is well-nigh  impossible to get him started within an hour of the appointed time, and  with a half dozen the difficulty is multiplied as many times. Just when you  think all is ready and that there can be no possible reason for delaying  longer, the whole crowd will disappear suddenly and you discover that they  have gone for \"chow.\" Then you know that the end is really in sight, for  chow usually is the last thing.    We waited nearly two hours on this particular morning before we started on  the long climb to the top of the mountain. The sun was simply blazing, and  in fifteen minutes we were soaked with perspiration. When we were half way  up the dogs disappeared in a small ravine overgrown with bamboo and sword  grass and suddenly broke into a chorus of yelps. They had found a fresh  trail and were driving our way.    Harry ran to a narrow opening in the jungle, shouting to us to watch  another higher up. We were hardly in position when his rifle banged,  followed by such a bedlam of yells and barks that we thought he must have  killed nothing less than one of the hunters. Before we reached them Harry  appeared, smiling all over, and dragging a muntjac (_Muntiacus_) by the  fore legs. He had just made a beautiful shot, for the clearing he had been  watching was not more than ten feet wide and the muntjac flashed across it  at full speed. Caldwell fired while it was in mid-air and his bullet caught  the animal at the base of the neck, rolling it over stone dead.    This beautiful little deer in Fukien is hardly larger than a fox. Its  antlers are only two or three inches in length and rise from an elongated  skin-covered pedicel instead of from the base of the skull as in all other  members of the deer family. On each side of the upper jaw is a slender  tusk, about two inches long, which projects well beyond the lips and makes  a rather formidable weapon.    We hoped that this muntjac was going to prove a \"good joss,\" but instead a  disappointing day was in store for us. When we had worked our way to the  very summit of the mountain under a merciless sun and over a trail which  led through a smothering bamboo jungle, we saw dozens of fresh serow  tracks. The animals were there without a doubt and we were on the _qui  vive_ with excitement.    We selected positions and the men made a long circuit to drive toward us as  Caldwell had directed. After half an hour had passed we heard them yelling  as they closed in, but what was our disgust to see them solemnly parading  in single file up the bottom of the valley on an open trail and carefully  avoiding all thickets where a serow could possibly be. As Harry expressed  it, \"all the animals had to do was to sit tight and watch the noble  procession pass.\" The beaters very evidently knew nothing whatever about  driving nor were we able to teach them, for they seriously objected to  leaving the open trails and going into the bush.    We worked hard for serow but the men were hopeless and it was impossible to  \"still hunt\" the animals at that time of the year. The natives say that in  September when the mushrooms are abundant in the lower forests the serow  leave the mountain tops and thick cover to feed upon the fungus, and that  they may be killed without the aid of beaters, but at any time the hunt  would involve a vast amount of labor with only a moderate chance of  success. After we had left Fukien, Mr. Caldwell purchased a fine male"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12297"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#6)"],[1,"gs. I was hungry and took the bucket and sat down behind the  barn and ate every bit of it. I didn't know it would make me sick, but  was I sick? I swelled up so that I all but bust. They had to doctor on  me. They took soot out of the chimney and mixed it with salt and made me  take that. I guess they saved my life, for I was awful sick.    \"I never learned to read until I was 26 years old. That was after I left  the plantation. I was staying at a place washing dishes for Goodyear's  at Sapville, Georgia, six miles from Waycross. I found a Webster's  spelling book that had been thrown away, and I learned to read from  that.    \"I wasn't converted until I went to work in a turpentine still and five  years later I was called to preach.

Do you remember saving the chicken feathers and goose feathers  always for your featherbeds?    Yes.    23. Do you remember when women wore hoop [TR: illegible] in their skirts  and when they stopped wearing them and wore narrow skirts?    Yes. My missus, she made me a pair of hoops, or I guess she bought it,  but some of the slaves took thin limbs from trees and made their hoops.  Others made them out of stiff paper and others would starch their skirts  stiff with rice starch to make their skirts stand way out. We thought  those hoops were just the thing for style.    25. Do you remember when you first saw your first windmill?    Yes. They didn't have them there.    26. Do you remember when you first saw bed springs instead of bed ropes?    I slept in a gunny bunk. My missus had a rope bed and she covered the  ropes with a cow hide. We made hay and corn shuck mattresses for her.  We'd cut the hay and shucks up fine and stuff the ticks with them. The  cow hides were placed on top of the mattresses to protect them.    27. When did you see the first buggy and what did it look like?    It was a buggy like you see.    28.

What interesting historical events happened during your youth, such  as Sherman's army passing through your section? Did you witness the  happenings and what was the reaction of the other Negroes to them?    I remember well when de war was on. I used to turn the big corn sheller  and sack the shelled corn for the Confederate soldiers. They used to  sell some of the corn and they gave some of it to the soldiers. Anyway  the Yankees got some and they did not expect them to get it. It was this  way: The Wheeler boys came through there ahead of Sherman's Army. Now,  we thought the Wheeler boys were Confederates. They came down the road  as happy as could be, a-singin'      \"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah    Hurrah for the Broke Book Boys    Hurrah for the Broke Brook Boys of South Carolina.\"    So of course we thought they were our soldiers a-singin' our songs.  Well, they came an' tol' our boss that Sherman's soldiers were coming'  and we'd better hide all our food and valuable things, for they'd take  everything they wanted. So we \"hoped\" our Massy hide the tings. They dug  holes and buried the potatoes and covered them with cotton seed and all  that. Then our ma say give dem food and thanked them for their kindness  and he set out wid two of the girls to tote them to safety, but before  he got back after the missus the Yanks were on us.    Our missus had od[TR:?] led us together and told us what to say. \"Now  you beg for me. If they ask you whether I've been good to you, you tell  'em 'yes'. If they ask you if we give you meat, you say 'yes'.\" Now de  res' didn't git any meat, but I did, 'cause I worked in the house. So I  didn't tell a lie, for I did git meat.    So we begged, an' we say, \"Our missus is good. Don't you kill her. Don't  you take our meat away from us. Don't you hurt her. Don't you burn her  house down.\" So they burned the stable and some of the other buildings,  but they did not burn the house nor hurt us any. We saw the rest of the  Yanks comin'. They never stopped for nothin'. Their horses would jump  the worn rail fences and they come 'cross fields 'n everything. They  bound our missus upstairs so she couldn't get away, then they came to  the sheds and we begged and begged for her. Then they loosed her, but  they took some of us for refugees and some of the slaves went off with  them of their own will. They took all the things that were buried all  the hams and everything they wanted. But they did not burn the house and  our missus was saved.    31. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted or joined the northern army?  Yes.    32. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted in the southern army?    Yes.    33. Did your master join the confederacy? What do you remember of his  return from the war? Or was he wounded and killed?    Yes. Two boys went. One was killed and one came back.    34. Did you live in Savannah when Sherman and the Northern forces  marched through the state, and do you remember the excitement in your  town or around"]]]
