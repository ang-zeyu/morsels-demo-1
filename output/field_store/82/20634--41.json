[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12902"],[0,"A Textbook of Theosophy (#6)"],[1,"may be considered as one vast soul, at one end of the scale; at the  other, when humanity is reached, we find that one vast soul broken up into  millions of the comparatively little souls of individual men. At any stage  between these two extremes we find an intermediate condition, the immense  world-soul already subdivided, but not to the utmost limit of possible  subdivision.    Each man is a soul, but not each animal or each plant. Man, as a soul, can  manifest through only one body at a time in the physical world, whereas one  animal soul manifests simultaneously through a number of animal bodies, one  plant soul through a number of separate plants. A lion, for example, is not  a permanently separate entity in the same way as a man is. When the man  dies--that is, when he as a soul lays aside his physical body--he remains  himself exactly as he was before, an entity separate from all other  entities. When the lion dies, that which has been the separate soul of him  is poured back into the mass from which it came--a mass which is at the  same time providing the souls for many other lions. To such a mass we give  the name of \"group-soul\".    To such a group-soul is attached a considerable number of lion bodies--let  us say a hundred. Each of those bodies while it lives has its hundredth  part of the group-soul attached to it, and for the time being this is  apparently quite separate, so that the lion is as much an individual during  his physical life as the man; but he is not a permanent individual. When he  dies the soul of him flows back into the group-soul to which it belongs,  and that identical lion-soul cannot be separated again from the group.    A useful analogy may help comprehension. Imagine the group-soul to be  represented by the water in a bucket, and the hundred lion bodies by a  hundred tumblers. As each tumbler is dipped into the bucket it takes out  from it a tumblerful of water (the separate soul). That water for the time  being takes the shape of the vehicle which it fills, and is temporarily  separate from the water which remains in the bucket, and from the water in  the other tumblers.    Now put into each of the hundred tumblers some kind of colouring matter or  some kind of flavouring. That will represent the qualities developed by its  experiences in the separate soul of the lion during its lifetime. Pour back  the water from the tumbler into the bucket; that represents the death of  the lion. The colouring matter or the flavouring will be distributed  through the whole of the water in the bucket, but will be a much fainter  colouring, a much less pronounced flavour when thus distributed than it was  when confined in one tumbler. The qualities developed by the experience of  one lion attached to that group-soul are therefore shared by the entire  group-soul, but in a much lower degree.    We may take out another tumblerful of water from that bucket, but we can  never again get exactly the same tumblerful after it has once been mingled  with the rest. Every tumblerful taken from that bucket in the future will  contain some traces of the colouring or flavouring put into each tumbler  whose contents have been returned to the bucket. Just so the qualities  developed by the experience of a single lion will become the common  property of all lions who are in the future to be born from that  group-soul, though in a lesser degree than that in which they existed in  the individual lion who developed them.    That is the explanation of inherited instincts; that is why the duckling  which has been hatched by a hen takes to the water instantly without  needing to be shown how to swim; why the chicken just out of its shell will  cower at the shadow of a hawk; why a bird which has been artificially  hatched, and has never seen a nest, nevertheless knows how to make one, and  makes it according to the traditions of its kind.    Lower down in the scale of animal life enormous numbers of bodies are  attached to a single group-soul--countless millions, for example, in the  case of some of the smaller insects; but as we rise in the animal kingdom  the number of bodies attached to a single group-soul becomes smaller and  smaller, and therefore the differences between individuals become greater.    Thus the group-souls gradually break up. Returning to the symbol of the  bucket, as tumbler after tumbler of water is withdrawn from it, tinted with  some sort of colouring matter and returned to it, the whole bucketful of  water gradually becomes richer in colour. Suppose that by imperceptible  degrees a kind of vertical film forms itself across the centre of the  bucket, and gradually solidifies itself into a division, so that we have  now a right half and a left half to the bucket, and each tumblerful of  water which is taken out is returned always to the same section from which  it came.    Then presently a difference will be set up, and the liquid in one half of  the bucket will no longer be the same as that in the other. We have then  practically two buckets, and when this stage is reached in a group-soul it  splits into two, as a cell separates by fission. In this way, as the  experience grows ever richer, the group-souls grow smaller but more  numerous, until at the highest point we arrive at man with his single  individual soul, which no longer returns into a group, but remains always  separate.    One of the life-waves is vivifying the whole of a kingdom; but not every  group-soul in that life-wave will pass through the whole of that kingdom  from the bottom to the top. If in the vegetable kingdom a certain  group-soul has ensouled forest trees, when it passes on into the animal  kingdom it will omit all the lower stages--that is, it will never inhabit  insects or reptiles, but will begin at once at the level of the lower  mammalia. The insects and reptiles will be vivified by group-souls which  have for some reason left the vegetable kingdom at a much lower level than  the forest tree. In the same way the group-soul which has reached the  highest levels of the animal kingdom will not individualize into primitive  savages, but into men of somewhat higher type, the primitive savages being  recruited from group-souls which have left the animal kingdom at a lower  level.    Group-souls at any level or at all levels arrange themselves into seven  great types, according to the Minister of the Deity through whom their life  has poured forth. These types are clearly distinguishable in all the  kingdoms, and the successive forms taken by any one of them form a  connected series, so that animals, vegetables, minerals and the varieties  of the elemental creatures may all be arranged into seven great groups, and  the life coming along one of those lines will not diverge into any of the  others.    No detailed list has yet been made of the animals, plants or minerals from  this point of view; but it is certain that the life which is found  ensouling a mineral of a particular type will never vivify a mineral of any  other type than its own, though within that type it may vary. When it  passes on to the vegetable and animal kingdoms it will inhabit vegetables  and animals of that type and of no other; and when it eventually reaches  humanity it will individualize into men of that type and of no other.    The method of individualization is the raising of the soul of a particular  animal to a level so much higher than that attained by its group-soul that  it can no longer return to the latter. This cannot be done with _any_  animal, but only with those whose brain is developed to a certain level,  and the method usually adopted to acquire such mental development is to  bring the animal into close contact with man. Individualization, therefore,  is possible only for domestic animals, and only for certain kinds even of  those. At the head of each of the seven types stands one kind of domestic  animal--the dog for one, the cat for another, the elephant for a third, the  monkey for a fourth, and so on. The wild animals can all be arranged on  seven lines leading up to the domestic animals; for example, the fox and  the wolf are obviously on the same line with the dog, while the lion, the  tiger and the leopard equally obviously lead up to the domestic cat; so  that the group-soul animating a hundred lions mentioned some time ago might  at a later stage of its evolution have divided into, let us say, five  group-souls each animating twenty cats.    The life-wave spends a long period of time in each kingdom; we are now only  a little past the middle of such an aeon, and consequently the conditions  are not favourable for the achievement of that individualization which  normally comes only at the end of a period. Rare instances of such  attainment may occasionally be observed on the part of some animal much in  advance of the average. Close association with man is necessary to produce  this result. The animal if kindly treated develops devoted affection for  his human friend, and also unfolds his intellectual powers in trying to  understand that friend and to anticipate his wishes. In addition to this,  the emotions and the thoughts of the man act constantly upon those of the  animal, and tend to raise him to a higher level both emotionally and  intellectually. Under favourable circumstances this development may proceed  so far as to raise the animal altogether out of touch with the group to  which he belongs, so that his fragment of a group-soul becomes capable of  responding to the outpouring which comes from the First Aspect of the  Deity.    For this final outpouring is not like the others, a mighty outrush  affecting thousands or millions simultaneously; it comes to each one  individually as that one is ready to receive it. This outpouring has  already descended as far as the intuitional world; but it comes no farther  than that until this upward leap is made by the soul of the animal from  below; but when that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"o, under my direction, had accomplished the work.  Just then however the first steam vessel arrived in Australia, and  afforded a regular coast-communication between Sydney and the northern  portion of the colony. The land communication became, in consequence, an  object of less importance than before, to the small handful of settlers  at least, although it was not the less essential to a respectable  government, or where an armed force had been organised, as in New South  Wales, solely for the suppression of bushrangers, a sub-genus in the  order banditti, which, happily, can no longer exist, except in places  inaccessible to the mounted police. The ascent northward from this ferry  on the Hawkesbury, is a substantial and permanent work, affording a  favourable specimen of the value of convict labour, in anticipating the  wants of an increasing population.    The country traversed by this new road is equally barren, and more  mountainous than the district between Parramatta and the Hawkesbury. Amid  those rocky heights and depths, across which I had recently toiled on  foot, marking out with no ordinary labour, the intended line, I had now  the satisfaction to trot over a new and level road, winding like a thread  through the dreary labyrinth before me, and in which various parts had  already acquired a local appellation not wholly unsuited to their  character, such as Hungry Flat, Devil's Backbone, No-grass Valley,* and  Dennis's Dog-kennel. In fact, the whole face of the country is composed  of sandstone rock, and but partially covered with vegetation. The horizon  is only broken by one or two summits, which are different both in outline  and quality from the surrounding country. These isolated heights  generally consist of trap-rock, and are covered with rich soil and very  heavy timber. The most remarkable is Warrawolong--whose top I first  observed from the hill of Jellore in the south, at the distance of 108  miles. This being a most important station for the general survey, which  I made previously to opening the northern road, it was desirable to clear  the summit, at least partly, of trees, a work which was accomplished  after considerable labour--the trees having been very large. On removing  the lofty forest, I found the view from that summit extended over a wild  waste of rocky precipitous ravines, which debarred all access or passage  in any direction, until I could patiently trace out the ridges between  them, and for this purpose I ascended that hill on ten successive days,  the whole of which time I devoted to the examination of the various  outlines and their connections, by means of the theodolite.    (*Footnote. Originally Snodgrass Valley--but Vox populi vox Dei. The  present name is shorter, and has the additional merit of being  descriptive--for the valley contains but little grass.)    Looking northward, an intermediate and lower range concealed from view  the valley of the Hunter, but the summits of the Liverpool range appeared  beyond it. On turning to the eastward, my view extended to the unpeopled  shores and lonely waters of the vast Pacific.    NATIVES OF BRISBANE WATER.    Not a trace of man, or of his existence, was visible on any side, except  a distant solitary column of smoke, that arose from a thicket between the  hill on which I stood and the coast, and marked the asylum of a remnant  of the aborigines. These unfortunate creatures could no longer enjoy  their solitary freedom; for the dominion of the white man surrounded  them. His sheep and cattle filled the green pastures where the kangaroo  (the principal food of the natives) was accustomed to range, until the  stranger came from distant lands and claimed the soil. Thus these first  inhabitants, hemmed in by the power of the white population, and deprived  of the liberty which they formerly enjoyed of wandering at will through  their native wilds, were compelled to seek a precarious shelter amidst  the close thickets and rocky fastnesses which afforded them a temporary  home, but scarcely a subsistence, for their chief support, the kangaroo,  was either destroyed or banished. I knew this unhappy tribe, and had  frequently met them in their haunts. In the prosecution of my surveys I  was enabled to explore the wildest recesses of these deep mountainous  ravines, guided occasionally by one or two of their number. I felt no  hesitation in venturing amongst them for, to me, they appeared a harmless  unoffending race.* On many a dark night, and even during rainy weather, I  have proceeded on horseback amongst these steep and rocky ranges, my path  being guided by two young boys belonging to the tribe, who ran cheerfully  before my horse, alternately tearing off the stringy bark which served  for torches, and setting fire to the grass-trees (xanthorrhoea) to light  my way.    (*Footnote. On my return from the interior in 1835 I learnt with much  regret that a war had commenced between my old friends and the mounted  police.)    This can scarcely be considered a digression from my narrative of this  day's journey, for Warrawolong was the only object visible, beyond the  woody horizon. We had passed No-Grass Valley, the Devil's Backbone, and  were approaching Hungry Flat, when Mr. Simpson produced a grilled fowl,  and a feed for our horses and we alighted most willingly for half an hour  to partake of this timely refreshment near a spring.    On remounting I bade Mr. Simpson farewell, after expressing my  satisfaction with his clever arrangements for opening this mountain road,  a work which he had accomplished with small means in nine months.    THE WOLLOMBI.    It was quite dark on the evening of the 26th, before I reached the inn  near the head of the little valley of the Wollombi, a tributary to the  river Hunter. Here, at length, we again find some soil fit for  cultivation, and the whole of it has been taken up in farms. But the  pasturage afforded by the numerous valleys on this side of the mountains,  here called cattle runs, is more profitable to the owners of the farms,  than the farms they actually possess, of which the produce by cultivation  is only available to them at present, as the means of supporting grazing  establishments. I should here observe, that in a climate so dry as that  of Australia, the selection of farmland depends solely on the direction  of streams, for it is only in the beds of watercourses, that any ponds  can be found during dry seasons. The formation of reservoirs has not yet  been resorted to, although the accidental largeness of ponds left in such  channels has frequently determined settlers in their choice of a  homestead, when by a little labour, a pond equally good might have been  made in other parts, which few would select from the want of water. In  the rocky gullies, that I had passed in these mountains, there was,  probably, a sufficiency, but there was no land fit for the purposes of  farming. In other situations, on the contrary, there might be found  abundance of good soil, considered unavailable for any purpose except  grazing, because it had no frontage (as it is termed) on a river or chain  of ponds. Selections have been frequently made of farms, which have thus  excluded extensive tracts behind them from the water, and these remaining  consequently unoccupied, have continued accessible only to the sheep or  cattle of the possessor of the water frontage.    In these valleys of the Upper Wollombi, we find little breadth of  alluvial soil, but a never-failing supply of water has already attracted  settlers to its banks--and those smallfarmers who live on a field or two  of maize and potatoes--and who are the only beginning of an agricultural  population, yet apparent, in New South Wales--show a disposition to  nestle in any available corner there. But on the lower portion of the  Wollombi, where the valley widens, and water becomes less abundant, the  soil being sandy, I found it impossible to locate some veterans on small  farms, which I had marked out for them, because it was known that in dry  seasons, although each farm had frontage on the Wollombi Brook, very few  ponds remained in that part of its channel.    JOIN THE PARTY.    November 27.    Early this morning, I had a visit from Mr. Finch, who was very anxious  that I should attach him to the exploring party. As I foresaw, that some  delay might occur in procuring provisions, without his assistance, in  this district, I accepted his services, and gave him his instructions,  conditionally. I met Mr. White at the junction of the Ellalong, and we  proceeded together, down the valley of the Wollombi.    The sandstone terminates in cliffs on the right bank of this stream near  the projected village of Broke (named by me in honour of that meritorious  officer, Sir Charles Broke Vere, Bart.) but the left bank is overlooked  by other rocky extremities falling from the ranges on the west, until it  reaches the main stream. The most conspicuous of these headlands, as they  appear from that of Mattawee behind the village of Broke, is called  Wambo. This consists of a dark mottled trap with crystals of felspar. But  the most remarkable feature in this extensive valley, is the termination  thereupon of the sandstone formation which renders barren so large a  proportion of the surface of New South Wales. This, in many parts,  resembles what was formerly called the iron-sand of England, where it  occurs both as a fresh and saltwater formation. The mountains northward  of this valley of the Hunter consist chiefly of trap-rock, the lower  country being open, and lightly wooded. The river, although occasionally  stagnant, contains a permanent supply of water, and consequently the  whole of the land on its banks, is favourable for the location of  settlers, and accordingly has been all taken up. The country, and  especially the hills beyond the left bank, affords excellent pasturage  for sheep, as many large and thriving establishments"]]]
