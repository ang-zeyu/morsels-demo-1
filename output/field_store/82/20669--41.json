The \"yes  vote\" of the above four counties was 8,061; the \"no vote\" 18,941.  Subtract these totals from the totals of the state vote and 154,618  \"yes\" and 154,079 \"no\" remains, giving a majority of 539 for woman  suffrage.    Once more in the history of suffrage referenda a foreign and colonized  population decided the issue. Was the election an honest one? That  is a question of interest to Iowa just now. The returns revealed some  suspicious facts. Nearly 30,000 more votes were cast on the suffrage  proposition than in the primary. Where did they come from? The  president of the W.C.T.U., Mrs. Ida B. Wise Smith, employed a  detective after the election. His investigation covered forty-four  counties and was not confined to those wherein woman suffrage  was lost. The findings have not been given to the public in their  entirety, but they were conclusive enough to cause an injunction suit  to be filed against the Board of Elections and the Legislature to  restrain them from accepting the official returns.    Registration was necessary for the amendment, not for the primary,  yet thousands of unregistered votes apparently were cast upon the  amendment. All good election laws provide that a definite number of  ballots shall be officially issued to each precinct; that the number  of those deposited in the ballot box, the number spoiled and those  unused shall not only tally with the number received, but the  unused ones must be counted, sealed, labelled and returned with the  certificate recording the count. This is the law of Iowa; but the  report of the investigation, as given to the press, shows that in  thirty-five counties out of the forty-four investigated no tally list  was used and there was nothing by which to check in order to determine  the correctness of the number on the certificate. In many cases no  unused ballots were returned. The poll lists did not tally with the  number of votes and even a recount could not reveal whether fraud or  carelessness had led to irregularity.    Despite the fact that the Iowa law provides that a definite number of  ballots and the same number of each kind is to be distributed to each  precinct, the separate suffrage ballots in a number of cases were  reported by election officials as not having arrived until the voting  had been in progress for some time; and in others they gave out an  hour before the polls closed.    Forty-seven varieties of violations of the election law are alleged to  have been committed. Do these indicate wilful fraud or mere ignorance  and carelessness? Just now no one seems prepared to answer. Meantime  Iowa, one of the most intelligent and progressive states in the  nation, stands at the bar of public opinion accused of incapacity  to conduct an honest election. How she will defend herself, what  reparation she will make to her women, and what steps she will take to  insure clean elections and better enforcement of her election law in  the future are problems which await the Legislature. That body cannot  refuse to take action of some kind without inviting the suspicion that  her legislators prefer conditions which lend themselves to the  base uses of election manipulators whenever they may care to avail  themselves of them.    On November 7, 1916, woman suffrage and prohibition amendments were  voted upon in South Dakota. It was the first time these two questions  have gone to referendum in the same election and the results furnish  interesting data for comparison.    Certain facts tell a story which should make progressive, patriotic  Americans and fair-minded Congressmen reflect.    Prohibition was carried by a majority of 11,469; woman suffrage  was lost by a majority of 4,664. Prohibition was lost in thirteen  counties; in one of these, Lawrence, which lies in the heart of the  mining country, prohibition was lost by two votes, and woman suffrage  was carried.    In all the others a large foreign population was the dominant power.  Had nine of the sixty-eight counties of the state not been included in  the returns woman suffrage would have been carried.    The total \"yes\" vote on woman suffrage was 51,687; the \"no\" vote  56,351.[A] The total \"yes\" vote of these nine counties was 4,877; the  \"no\" vote was 10,569. Subtracting these county totals from the state  totals the record would stand 46,810 \"yes\" votes and 45,782 \"no\"  votes.    [Footnote A: The figures here used are those given to the press by the  County Boards of Election. The final returns were not available.]    Who then are the voters of nine counties who kept the women of an  entire state disfranchised? The following table presents the answer:    ==================================================================  |             |            |           |             |  Total    |  |             |            |           |    Total    | German,   |  |             |   Total    |   Total   | Foreign and | Austrian, |  |  Counties   | Population |  Native   | Foreign     | Russian,  |  |             |            | Parentage | Parentage   | or of such|  |             |            |           |             | Parentage |  |-------------+------------+-----------+-------------+-----------|  |Bon Homme....|   11,061   |   3,448   |     7,6l3   |   4,759   |  |Brule .......|    6,451   |   3,008   |     3,443   |   1,556   |  |Charles Mix..|   14,899   |   6,387   |     8,512   |   2,757   |  |Campbell ....|    5,244   |     600   |     4,644   |   3,491   |  |Douglas .....|    6,400   |   2,017   |     4,383   |   1,644   |  |McCook ......|    9,589   |   4,068   |     5,521   |   1,691   |  |Hutchinson ..|   12,319   |   2,671   |     9,648   |   7,515   |  |McPherson ...|    6,791   |   1,152   |     5,639   |   4,889   |  |Turner ......|   13,840   |   4,206   |     9,634   |   4,432   |  |================================================================    The large \"no\" vote in several counties was due to the same character  of population. The total population is 583,888, the population of  foreign birth or foreign parentage is 243,835. South Dakota is one of  the eight remaining states where foreigners may vote on their \"first  papers\" and citizenship is not a qualification for a vote.    The returns offer still other food for reflection. Hutchinson county,  for example, carried prohibition and lost woman suffrage. It gave 584  dry votes; 510 wet votes. It gave 432 \"yes\" votes on woman suffrage  and 1,583 \"no\" votes. Thus 921 more votes were cast on the suffrage  proposition than on the prohibition question. The people in this  county are German-Russians and exceedingly ignorant. Apparently  they were not intelligent enough to be lined up to vote \"no\" on both  questions. Is it not likely that these votes were intended to be \"wet\"  and that they made a mistake and picked No. 6 instead of No. 7? If  not, why not?    The largest group of the foreign population of these counties are  German-Russians. They migrated from Germany and found a home in Russia  some 230 or more years ago, in order to escape conscription. When  Russia began to enforce conscription about 1888 the entire group came  to America and settled in colonies in the Western states which at the  time offered free lands. They were totally illiterate then. They had  not progressed as Germans in their own country had done but being  clannish had remained at the point of development reached at the date  of their migration. They are still clannish and have not yet escaped  from the mental habits of the Middle Ages. These are the men who have  denied American women the vote in South Dakota. That the women of  South Dakota in very large numbers wanted the vote no one questions.  During the campaign six women in Sioux Falls published an appeal to  voters not to support the amendment as they did not wish to vote.  Shortly after an appeal to the voters of the same city was published  and was signed by 3,000 women. In every county of the state the women  manifested their interest by doing all they knew how to do. West  Virginia was the first Southern state to submit a referendum on woman  suffrage and the vote was taken November 7, 1916. The amendment was  defeated by the largest proportional majority any suffrage amendment  ever received. Unlike Iowa and South Dakota, where all the educated  classes with notable exceptions believe in woman suffrage, West  Virginia probably has many conscientious doubters. Arguments and  excuses which did service in the West twenty-five years ago were  brought forward as though just formulated. The illiteracy of the state  is appallingly high and the illiterate is universally an antiwomen  suffragist.    The ever present prohibition issue again played an important if not  a determining part. A prohibition law was voted in by an immense  majority in 1912, but the undismayed \"wets\" propose to secure a  resubmission if possible. They apparently regarded the woman suffrage  amendment as an outer defense to be taken before the march on the main  prohibition fort could be begun; and every \"wet,\" high and low, was  on duty. The \"drys\" who would do well to study Napoleon's rule of  strategy, that is, \"find out what your enemy doesn't want you to do,  and then do it,\" were much disturbed as to what St. Paul would think  were he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#6)"],[1," things of interest, and in remote  districts they may do good service in rescuing important objects  which may be wanted in museums. Forgeries are ubiquitous, even in  most obscure places in the hands of peasants, either supplied by  dealers, or casually obtained, often in good faith. It is best to  inquire of local collectors and museums as to the kinds of forgeries  met with. The following notes are to show the novice how far he may  go safely.    Bronze figures with a thick red patina, which scales off readily  sometimes, or with thick green patina cracked, or hard green or brown  patina, are safe. Thin green patina, or bare brown or black metal is  dubious.    Papyri in roll, flexible though fragile, in known Greek or Egyptian  writing, are fairly safe. Lumps stuck together, brown and scrappy,  are made up.    Coins cannot be safely bought unless patinated, copper or silver.  Only an expert can judge of gold or 'clean silver.    Jewellery of small size, as earrings and bracelets, is generally  safe, if the age of the design is known. Modern wire is always drawn,  ancient is irregular. Look for concretions of lime in the hollows,  and for the dull face of old gold. If once cleaned there is little to  distinguish old from modern gold.    Stone vases if turned are Roman or modern. The ancient irregularities  should be studied from specimens.    Scarabs with nacreous or decomposed glaze in the hollows (as in the  deep cuts at the side) are safe; also, if there are natural cracks by  age, which would prevent modern cutting. There is a large variety of  skilful forgeries.    Stone statuettes: a skilled forger may be paid up to 100 pounds for a  figure to order. Only an expert can judge.    Never buy in the dusk or in dark rooms. When buying never have any  one at hand who calls attention to things, nor let any attendant  interfere. Seem entirely unconcerned.    Get the reputation of never advancing on offers, or bargaining; let  taking or leaving things at once be the rule. Time and delays are  money to the traveller, and it is worth much to save time in  haggling. Your donkey-boy will soon spread your character.    When offering for single things to a peasant, put the money by the  side of the antiquity, and say that he must take one or the other:  fingering the cash is irresistible, and no time is lost.    If it is likely that the source of an object will not be truly  stated, the way is to make the best guess you can, and say it  dogmatically: the pleasure of setting you right will often bring out  the truth, or if you guessed right it will gain you credit and break  down reserve.    As a principle it is well to be looked on as a liberal buyer, so as  to encourage the offer of antiquities. A little more thus spent will  be a trifling extra on the whole journey, and may largely increase  the results in objects and information for future work.    Though prices can only be learned by practice, and they vary in time  and place, yet the following scale may be taken as fairly safe.    Bronze figures if good work, inches high squared = shillings: except  in bad state, or Osiris, or bad clumsy work, or votive animals.    Papyri or parchment, continuous text, 1 pound a square foot,  accounts, half or a third.    Jewellery, between weight in coin and double that, according to work.    Scarabs, common but fair 2s., names 2s.-5s.; up to 5 pounds or 10  pounds if beautiful. Engraved gems, small common Roman, 2s.-4s. in  London, more in East; for a fair Greek 1 pound-10 pounds.    Coins often higher in the East than in London. In Greek lands copper  coins may be bought by weight, and picked over at leisure, and the  worthless coins rejected. For single coins fix a price, say half a  franc, and offers of large numbers may come in, from which the best  can be chosen and the rest refused.    Glass vases, blown, inches high squared at 4d. or 6d. each. Coloured  glass double or triple.    Ushabtis, poor 1s.-4s., fair 5s.-10s., fine blue or engraved 1 pound-  10 pounds.
