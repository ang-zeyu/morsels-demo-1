His letters put me in mind of tumult and anarchy; there is sedition in  every sentence; syllable has no longer any confidence in syllable, but  dissolves its connexion as preferring an alliance with the succeeding  word. A page of his epistle looks like the floor of a garden-house,  covered with old, crooked nails, which have just been released from a  century's durance in a brick wall. I cannot cast my eyes on his  character without being religious. This is the only good effect I have  derived from his writings; he brings into my mind the resurrection,  and paints the tumultuous resuscitation of awakened men with a pencil  of masterly confusion. I am fully convinced of one thing, either that  he or his pen is intoxicated when he writes to me, for his letters  seem to have borrowed the reel of wine, and stagger from one corner of  the sheet to the other. They remind me of Lord Chatham's  administration, lying together heads and points in one truckle-bed.           *       *       *       *       *      WINE AND WATER.      The same quantity of wine diluted intoxicates sooner than the same  quantity drank in the same time _without_ dilution; the wine being  applied to a larger surface of the stomach, acts with proportionably  greater quickness--though wine _diluted_ sooner _intoxicates_, its  effects are sooner over.--_Dr. Kitchiner_.           *       *       *       *       *      NEW SOUTH WALES.      Of the total population of New South Wales, which, in round numbers,  may be taken at 40,000, the Free Emigrants      amount only to about ............ 7,000    Native Children ................. 5,000    Emancipated Convicts............. 8,000    Convicts in Servitude .......... 20,000                                     ______                                     40,000             *       *       *       *       *      OMEN.      As Cooke, the solicitor-general, was beginning to open the pleadings  at the trial of Charles I, the king gently tapped him on the shoulder  with his cane, crying \"Hold, hold!\" At the same moment the silver head  of the cane fell off, and rolled on the floor.           *       *       *       *       *      COTTAGE GARDENS.      The comforts and benefits to be derived from a well cultivated garden,  by a poor man's family, are almost beyond calculation. What a resource  for hours after work, or when trade is dull, and regular work scarce!  What a contrast and counteraction is the healthy, manly, employment  which a cottage garden affords, to the close, impure, unwholesome air,  the beastliness and obscenity, the waste of time, the destruction of  morals, the loss of character, money, and health, which are the  inmates of too many common ale-houses!--_Gardener's Mag_.           *       *       *       *       *      PAINTING.      Painting, were the use of it universal, would be a powerful means of  instruction to children and the lower orders; and were all the fine  surfaces, which are now plain, and absolutely wasted, enriched with  the labours of the art, if they once began to appear, they would  accumulate rapidly; and were the ornamented edifices open to all, as  freely as they ought to be, a wide field of new and agreeable study  would offer itself. A person, who thoroughly understood the  well-chosen subjects, and was qualified to explain them to a stranger,  could not be devoid of knowledge, nor could his mind want food for  constant contemplation. The sense of beauty has hitherto been little  cultivated in Great Britain; but it certainly exists, and shows itself  principally in laying out gardens and pleasure-grounds with unrivalled  skill.--_Edin. Review_.           *       *       *       *       *          Spirit of Discovery.           *       *       *       *       *      _Hydrophobia_.      In the _New Monthly Magazine_ for October, 1826, is the following  statement of the efficacy of the guaco for the cure of the bite of a  mad dog, published by the gentleman who first made use of the plant in  South America, as an antidote to that scourge of human nature,  hydrophobia; his words are, \"I shall simply state, that during my  residence in South America, I had frequent opportunities of witnessing  the direful effects of hydrophobia, without having in any one case  that came under my care been successful in its cure by the usual modes  prescribed in Europe. It fortunately occurred to me, that the guaco,  so celebrated for curing the bite or sting of all venomous snakes,  might prove equally efficacious in hydrophobic cases. How far my idea  was correct that an analogy existed between the virus of a serpent and  that of a rabid dog, I leave to others to determine; but such was my  opinion, and I acted upon it in all subsequent cases with complete  success.\"    We understand the same gentleman has received from South America two  plants which he was in the habit of prescribing for insanity and  pulmonary consumption, with the happiest effects; and as it is his  intention to give them an immediate trial, should they be found to  answer in Europe, as in South America, of which he has not the least  doubt, the discovery may be considered as of the first consequence in  medicine.      _Mutton Hams_.      The _Journal Des Reconnaissances Useless_ gives the following method of  curing legs of mutton like ham:--It is necessary that the mutton  should be very fat. Two ounces of raw sugar must be mixed with an  ounce of common salt and half a spoonful of saltpetre. The meat is to  be rubbed well with this, and then placed in a tureen. It must be  beaten and turned twice a day during three consecutive days; and the  scum which comes from the meat having been taken off, it is to be  wiped, and again rubbed with the mixture. The next day it should be  again beaten, and the two operations ought to be repeated alternately  during ten days, care being taken to turn the meat each time. It must  be then exposed to the smoke for ten days. These hams are generally  eaten cold.      _Potato Chestnuts_.      A mode has been adopted to prepare potatoes as food, which has at  least one advantage--that of economy. The potatoes are roasted in a  kiln or oven, and are thus prevented from sprouting, (which injures  their quality so much at this season of the year,) and are thus  preserved for some time in a fit state for consumption. They are  better for being again heated before they are used, and though it is  to be regretted that persons should be reduced to such food, yet they  are cheaper and more wholesome than the bread usually given in times  of scarcity to the poorer classes.      _New Pyrometer_.      A new air-thermometer has been invented by M. Pouillet, for the  purpose of measuring degrees of heat in very high temperatures; an  object hitherto of very difficult attainment. By means of this  instrument it has been ascertained, that the heat of melted silver is  1677 deg.; of a melted mixture of one part gold and three parts silver,  1803 deg.; and of melted pure gold 2096 deg..      _To Destroy Slugs_.      A correspondent of the _Gardener's Magazine_ states, that after in  vain trying salt, lime, and dibbling holes for preserving young  cauliflowers and cabbages from slugs, he succeeded by spreading some  well cut chaff round the plants under hand glasses, and some round the  outsides of the glasses. The slugs in their attempt to reach the  plant, find themselves immediately enveloped in the chaff, which  prevents their moving, so that when he raised the glasses to give the  plants air, he found hundreds of disabled slugs round the outside of  the glasses, which he took away and destroyed.      _To make Kitchen Vegetables tender_.      When peas, French beans, &c. do not boil easily, it has usually been  imputed to the coolness of the season, or to the rains. This popular  notion is erroneous. The difficulty of boiling them soft arises from  an excess of gypsum imbibed during their growth. To correct this,  throw a small quantity of subcarbonate of soda into the pot along with  the vegetables.--_From the French_.        _Beet Root Sugar_      Has now become an article of some practical magnitude in French  commerce; since the annual consumption is between seven and eight  million pounds.      _Silk Trade_.      It was lately mentioned by Mr. Huskisson, in the House of Commons, as  a proof of the flourishing state of our trade, that British Bandanna  handkerchiefs were in the course of shipment to India. In addition to  this fact, we can state of our own knowledge that they are now  exporting to France, in no inconsiderable quantities, not merely as  samples, but in the regular course of trade.--_For. Quart. Rev._      _Electricity_.      It is curious to take a retrospective view of the mode in which the  effects of the Leyden phial were announced to the world, on their  first discovery. The philosophers who first experienced, in their own  person, the shock attendant on the transmission of an electric  discharge, were so impressed with wonder and with terror by this novel  sensation, that they wrote the most ridiculous and exaggerated account  of their feelings on the occasion. Muschenbrok states, that he  received so dreadful a concussion in his arms, shoulder, and heart,  that he lost his breath, and it was two days before he could recover  from its effects; he declared also, that he should not be induced to  take another shock for the whole kingdom of France. Mr. Allemand  reports, that the shock deprived him of breath for some minutes, and  afterwards produced so acute a pain along his right arm, that he was  apprehensive it might be attended with serious consequences. Mr.  Winkler informs us, that it threw his whole body into convulsions, and  excited such a ferment in his blood, as would have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11341"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Mr. Fox at St. Ann's Hill was, for the last years of his life, in the  habit (never interfered with by his friends) of dosing for a few minutes  after dinner; and it was on this occasion, unconsciously yielding to the  influence of custom, I perceived that Mr. Garrow, who was the chief  talker (Parr was in his smoking orgasm,) began to feel embarrassed at  Mr. Fox's non-attention; and I, therefore, made signs to Mr. Fox, by  wiping my fingers to my eyes, and looking expressively at Garrow. Mr.  Fox, the most _truly_ polite man in the world, immediately endeavoured  to rouse himself--but in vain; Nature would have her way. Garrow soon  saw the struggle, and adroitly feigned sleep himself. Mr. Fox was  regenerated in ten minutes--apologized--and made the evening  delightful--_Senatorial Reminiscenses_.--_The Inspector_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.             *       *       *       *       *      CHRONICLES OF THE CANONGATE.    _The Two Drovers._    (_Concluded from page 289._)          [Our readers must have missed, and probably with some regret,      the conclusion of the above story, as promised for insertion in      our last Number; and unaccustomed as we are to an intentional      discrepancy of this sort, (for such was the above,) we shall      consider ourselves justified in briefly stating some of the      circumstances which led to the irregularity. We are not disposed      to enter into the tilts of rival journalists, some of whom, in      taking time by the forelock, may have perhaps been rather more      enterprising than the subject warranted.[17] Nevertheless, in      the attempt to please the public, as in other races, the      youngest are often the fleetest. In the present case, the      appetite of the public had been _whetted_ with \"reiterated      advertisement:\" and one of our contemporaries, with more      playfulness than truth, had compared his priority to that of      _Fine-ear_ in the fairy tale. But his talisman failed, and a      young rival outstripped him; and from this quarter we were      induced to copy the first portion of the tale of _The Two      Drovers_, upon the editor's assurance of his own honesty in      obtaining the precedence, and which assurance We are still      unwilling to question: although, were we to do so, ours would      not he a solitary specimen of such ingratitude.[18] On the day      of our publishing the first portion, we received a notice to      desist from its continuance,--full of the causticity of our      friends on the other side of the Tweed, and with whom, for the      credit of the south, we hope the measure originated. We next      resolved to suspend the conclusion; since the _brutum fulmen_      became louder and louder still, in an advertisement actively      inserted in the London newspapers. To make short of what is and      ought to be but a trifling affair, we have _abridged_ the whole      story, and accordingly now present the conclusion to our      readers, though certainly not in the promised state; how far we      have exculpated ourselves, is for our patrons to determine.--A      few words at parting, on the policy of the above conduct. We      need not enlarge upon the advantages which publishers (and, to      some extent, authors) derive from portions of their works      appearing in periodical journals. The benefit is not reciprocal,      but largely on their side, if they consider how many columns of      advertisement duty they thereby avoid. It is well known that the      _first edition_ of any work by such a master-spirit as Sir      Walter Scott is consumed in a few days by the circulating      libraries and reading societies of the kingdom; but how many      thousands would neither have seen nor heard of his most      successful works, had not the _gusto_ been previously created by      the caducei of these literary Mercuries. Again, sift any one of      them, with higher pretensions to originality than our economical      sheet will admit of, and you shall find it, in _quantity_, at      least, to resemble Gratiano's three grains. But we are not      inclined to quarrel with the scheme, for with Johnson we say,      \"Quotation, sir (Walter), is a good thing,\" in the hope of      hearing our readers reply, \"This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons      peas.\"--ED.]    Some words passed after the departure, of Robin Oig, between the  bailiff, and Harry Wakefield, who was now not indisposed to defend Robin  Oig's reputation. But Dame Heskett prevented this second quarrel by her  peremptory interference. The conversation turned on the expected  markets, and the prices from different parts of Scotland and England,  and Harry Wakefield found a chap for a part of his drove, and at a  considerable profit; an event more than sufficient to blot out all  remembrances of the past scuffle. But there remained one from whose mind  that recollection could not have been wiped by possession of every head  of cattle betwixt Esk and Eden.    This was Robin Oig M'Combich.--\"That I should have had no weapon,\" he  said, \"and for the first time in my life!--Blighted be the tongue that  bids the Highlander part with the dirk--the dirk--ha! the English  blood!--My muhme's word--when did her word fall to the ground?\"    Robin now turned the light foot of his country towards the wilds,  through which, by Mr. Ireby's report, Morrison was advancing. His mind  was wholly engrossed by the sense of injury the treasured ideas of  self-importance and self-opinion--of ideal birth and quality, had become  more precious to him, (like the hoard to the miser,) because he could  only enjoy them in secret. But insulted, abused, and beaten, he was no  longer worthy, in his own opinion, of the name he bore, or the lineage  which he belonged to--nothing was left to him--but revenge.    When Robin Oig left the door of the ale-house, seven or eight English  miles at least lay betwixt him and Morrison, whose advance was limited  by the sluggish pace of his cattle. And now the distant lowing of  Morrison's cattle is heard; and now he meets them--passes them, and  stops their conductor.    \"May good betide us,\" said the South-lander--\"Is this you, Robin  M'Combich, or your wraith?\"    \"It is Robin Oig M'Combich,\" answered the Highlander, \"and it is  not.--But never mind that, give me pack my dirk, Hugh Morrison, or there  will be words petween us.\"    \"There it is for you then, since less wunna serve.\"    \"Cot speed you, Hughie, and send you good marcats. Ye winna meet with  Robin Oig again either at tryste or fair.\"    So saying, he shook hastily the hand of his acquaintance, and set out in  the direction from which he had advanced.    Long ere the morning dawned, the catastrophe of our tale had taken  place. It was two hours after the affray when Robin Oig returned to  Heskett's inn. There was Harry Wakefield, who amidst a grinning group of  smockfrocks, hob-nailed shoes, and jolly English physiognomies, was  trolling forth an old ditty, when he was interrupted by a high and stern  voice, saying \"Harry Waakfelt--if you be a man, stand up!\"    \"Harry Waakfelt,\" repeated the same ominous summons, \"stand up, if you  be a man!\"    \"I will stand up with all my heart, Robin, my boy, but it shall be to  shake hands with you, and drink down all unkindness.    \"'Tis not thy fault, man, that, not having the luck to be an Englishman,  thou canst not fight more than a school-girl.\"    \"I _can_ fight,\" answered Robin Oig, sternly, but calmly, \"and you shall  know it. You, Harry Waakfelt, showed me to-day how the Saxon churls  fight--I show you now how the Highland Dunniewassal fights.\"    He then plunged the dagger, which he suddenly displayed, into the broad  breast of the English yeoman, with such fatal certainty and force, that  the hilt made a hollow sound against the breast bone, and the  double-edged point split the very heart of his victim. Harry Wakefield  fell, and expired with a single groan.    Robin next offered the bloody poniard to the bailiff's throat.    \"It were very just to lay you beside him,\" he said, \"but the blood of a  base pick-thank shall never mix on my father's dirk, with that of a  brave man.\"    As he spoke, he threw the fatal weapon into the blazing turf-fire.    \"There,\" he said, \"take me who likes--and let fire cleanse blood if it  can.\"    The pause still continuing, Robin Oig asked for a peace-officer, and a  constable having stepped out, he surrendered himself.    \"A bloody night's work you have made of it,\" said the constable.    \"Your own fault,\" said the Highlander. \"Had you kept his hands off me  twa hours since, he would have been now as well and merry as he was twa  minutes since.\"    \"It must be sorely answered,\" said the peace-officer.    \"Never you mind that--death pays all debts; it will pay that too.\"    The constable, with assistance, procured horses to guard the prisoner to  Carlisle, to abide his doom at the next"]]]
