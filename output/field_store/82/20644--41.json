My preference was to come home at night, so that I could go to sleep  immediately.[6] Ach, Gott!--and now? What a different view I take of  everything--not merely that which concerns you as well, and because it  concerns you, or will concern you also (although I have been bothering  myself for two days with the question where your writing-desk will  stand), but my whole view of life is a new one, and I am cheerful and  interested even in my work on the dike and police matters. This  change, this new life, I owe, next to God, to you, _ma tres chere, mon  adoree Jeanneton_--to you who do not heat me occasionally, like an  alcohol flame, but work in my heart like warming fire. Some one is  knocking.    Visit from the co-director, who complains of the people who will not  pay their school taxes. The man asks me whether my _fiancee_ is tall.    \"Oh yes; rather.\"    \"Well, an acquaintance of mine saw you last summer with several ladies  in the Harz Mountains, and you preferred to converse with the tallest,  that must have been your _fiancee_.\"    The tallest woman in your party was, I fancy, Frau von Mittelstaedt.  * * * The Harz! The Harz!    After a thorough consultation with Frau Bellin, I have decided to make  no special changes here for the present, but to wait until we can hear  the wishes of the lady of the house in the matter, so that we may have  nothing to be sorry for. In six months I hope we shall know what we  have to do.    It is impossible as yet to say anything definite about our next meeting.  Just now it is raining; if that continues the Elbe may be played out in  a week or two, and then. * * * Still no news whatever about the Landtag.  Most cordial greetings and assurances of my love to your parents, and  the former--the latter, too, if you like--to all your cousins, women  friends, etc. What have you done with Aennchen?[7] My forgetting the  Versin letters disturbs me; I did not mean to make such a bad job of it.  Have they been found Farewell, my treasure, my heart, consolation of my  eyes.    Your faithful BISMARCK.      Another picture, a description of a storm in the Alps, which catches  my eye as I turn over the pages of the book, and pleases me much:      \"The sky is changed, and such a change! O night,    And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,    Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light    Of a dark eye in woman! Far along    From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,    Leaps the live thunder; not from one lone cloud,    But every mountain now has found a tongue,    And Jura answers through her misty shroud--    Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud.      And this is in the night:--most glorious night!    Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be    A sharer in thy fierce and fair delight--    A portion of the tempest and of thee!    How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,    And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!    And now again 'tis black, and now the glee    Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,    As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.\"    On such a night the suggestion comes uncommonly near to me that I wish  to be _a sharer in the delight, a portion of tempest, of night_;[8]  mounted on a runaway horse, to dash down the cliffs into the falls of  the Rhine, or something similar. A pleasure of that kind,  unfortunately, one can enjoy but once in this life. There is something  intoxicating in nocturnal storms. Your nights, dearest, I hope you  regard, however, as _sent for slumber, not for writing_.[9] I see with  regret that I write English still more illegibly than German. Once  more, farewell, my heart. Tomorrow noon I am invited to be the guest  of Frau Brauchitsch, presumably so that I may be duly and thoroughly  questioned about you and yours. I'll tell them as much as I please.  _Je t'embrasse mille fois._    Your own    B.      Schoenhausen, February 7, '47.    _My Heart_,--Just returned through a wild, drifting snow-storm from an  appointment (which unfortunately was occasioned by the burning out of a  poor family). I have warmed myself at your dear letter; in the twilight,  even, I recognized your \"Right honorable.\" All my limbs are twitching  with eagerness to be off to Berlin again today, and to characterize the  dikes and floods in terms of the unutterable Poberow[10] dialect. The  inexorable thermometer stands at 2 below freezing-point, accompanied  with howling wind and large flakes, as though it would soon rain. What  is duty! Compare Falstaff's expressions touching honor. At any rate, I  shall write you straightway, even if I ruin myself in postage, and no  sensible thoughts find their way through the debris of the fire that  still has possession of my imagination. After reading your last remark I  have just lit my cigar and stirred the ink. First, like a business-man,  to answer your letter. I begin with a request smacking of the official  desk--namely, that when you write you will, if you please, expressly  state what letters you have received from me, giving their dates;  otherwise one is uncertain as to the regular forwarding of them, as I am  in doubt whether you have received my first letter, which I wrote the  day of my arrival here, while on a business trip, in Jerichow, if I  mistake not, on very bad paper, Friday, the 29th of January. I am very  thankful that you do not write in the evening, my love, even if I am  myself to suffer thereby. Every future glance into your gray-blue-black  eye with its large pupil will compensate me for possibly delayed or  shortened letters.    If I could only dream of you when you do of me! But recently I do not  dream at all--shockingly healthy and prosaic; or does my soul fly to  Reinfeld in the night and associate with yours? In that case it can  certainly not dream here; but it ought to tell about its journey in  the morning, whereas the wayward thing is as silent about its  nocturnal employments as though it, too, slept like a badger.    Your reminder of the bore, Fritz, with the letter-pouch transports me  to Reinfeld and makes me long still more eagerly for the time when I  can once again hug my black Jeannette for my good-morning at the desk.  About the letter with the strange address, _evidently_ in a woman's  hand, I should like to tell you a romantic story, but I must destroy  every illusion with the explanation that it comes from a man who used  to be a friend of mine, who, if I do not mistake, once in Kniephof  took a copy of an Italian address that I received. Again a curtain  behind which one fancies there is all the poetry in the world, and  finds the flattest prose. (I once saw in Aix-la-Chapelle, while  strolling about the stage, the Princess of Eboli, after I had just  spent my sympathy upon her as she lay overwhelmed and fainting at the  queen's feet in one of the scenes, eating bread and butter and  cracking bad jokes behind the scenes.) That cousin Woedtke is fond of  me, and that the Versin sausage and letter affair is all right, I am  glad to learn.    I need not assure you that I have the most heartfelt sympathy for the  sufferings of your good mother; I hope rest and summer will affect her  health favorably, and that she will recover after a while, with the  joy of seeing her children happy. When she is here she shall not have  any steps to go up to reach you, and shall live directly next to you.    Why do you wear mournful black in dress and heart, my angel?  Cultivate the green of hope that today made right joyous revelry in me  at sight of its external image, when the gardener placed the first  messengers of spring, hyacinths and crocus, on my window-ledge. _Et  dis-moi donc, pourquoi es-tu paresseuse? Pourquoi ne fais-tu pas de  musique?_ I fancied you playing _c-dur_ when the hollow, melting wind  howls through the dry twigs of the lindens, and _d-moll_ when the  snow-flakes chase in fantastic whirls around the corners of the old  tower, and, after their desperation is spent, cover the graves with  their winding-sheet. Oh, were I but Keudell, I'd play now all day  long, and the tones would bear me over the Oder, Rega, Persante,  Wipper--I know not whither. _A propos de paresse_, I am going to  permit myself to make one more request of you, but with a preface.  When I ask you for anything I add (do not take it for blasphemy or  mockery) thy will be done--_your_ will, I mean; and I do not love you  less, nor am I vexed with you for a second if you do not fulfil my  request. I love you as you are, and as you choose to be. After I have,  by way of preface, said so much with inmost, unadorned truth, without  hypocrisy or flattery, I beg you to pay some attention to French--not  much, but somewhat--by reading French things that interest you, and,  what is not clear to you, make it clear with the dictionary. If it  bores you, stop it; but, lest it bore you, try it with books that  interest you, whatever they may be--romances or anything else. I do  not know your mother's views on such reading, but in my opinion there  is nothing that you cannot read to yourself. I do not ask this for my  own sake, for we will understand each other in our mother tongue, but  in your intercourse with the world you will not seldom find occasions  when it will be disagreeable or even mortifying if you are unfamiliar  with French. I do not know, indeed, to what degree this is true of  you, but reading is in any case a way to keep what you have and to  acquire more. If it pleases you, we shall find a way for you to become  more fluent in talking, than, as you say, you are now. If you do not  like it, rely with entire confidence on the preface to my request.    I wrote to poor Moritz yesterday, and, after reading your description  of his sadness, my letter lies like a stone on my conscience, for,  like a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#6)"],[1," right letter. Is it 'b?' Is it 'c?'\"    But there was now not a flicker in the inspector's pallid face. The head  dropped heavily on the chest. Verot gave two or three sighs, his frame  shook with one great shiver, and he moved no more.    He was dead.    The tragic scene had been enacted so swiftly that the men who were  its shuddering spectators remained for a moment confounded. The  solicitor made the sign of the cross and went down on his knees. The  Prefect murmured:    \"Poor Verot!... He was a good man, who thought only of the service, of  his duty. Instead of going and getting himself seen to--and who knows?  Perhaps he might have been saved--he came back here in the hope of  communicating his secret. Poor Verot!--\"    \"Was he married? Are there any children?\" asked Don Luis.    \"He leaves a wife and three children,\" replied the Prefect.    \"I will look after them,\" said Don Luis simply.    Then, when they brought a doctor and when M. Desmalions gave orders for  the corpse to be carried to another room, Don Luis took the doctor  aside and said:    \"There is no doubt that Inspector Verot was poisoned. Look at his  wrist: you will see the mark of a puncture with a ring of inflammation  round it.\"    \"Then he was pricked in that place?\"    \"Yes, with a pin or the point of a pen; and not as violently as they may  have wished, because death did not ensue until some hours later.\"    The messengers removed the corpse; and soon there was no one left in the  office except the five people whom the Prefect had originally sent for.  The American Secretary of Embassy and the Peruvian attache, considering  their continued presence unnecessary, went away, after warmly  complimenting Don Luis Perenna on his powers of penetration.    Next came the turn of Major d'Astrignac, who shook his former subordinate  by the hand with obvious affection. And Maitre Lepertais and Perenna,  having fixed an appointment for the payment of the legacy, were  themselves on the point of leaving, when M. Desmalions entered briskly.    \"Ah, so you're still here, Don Luis Perenna! I'm glad of that. I have an  idea: those three letters which you say you made out on the  writing-table, are you sure they form the syllable Fau?\"    \"I think so, Monsieur le Prefet. See for yourself: are not these an 'F,'  an 'A' and a 'U?' And observe that the 'F' is a capital, which made me  suspect that the letters are the first syllable of a proper name.\"    \"Just so, just so,\" said M. Desmalions. \"Well, curiously enough, that  syllable happens to be--But wait, we'll verify our facts--\"    M. Desmalions searched hurriedly among the letters which his secretary  had handed him on his arrival and which lay on a corner of the table.    \"Ah, here we are!\" he exclaimed, glancing at the signature of one of the  letters. \"Here we are! It's as I thought: 'Fauville.' ... The first  syllable is the same.... Look, 'Fauville,' just like that, without  Christian name or initials. The letter must have been written in a  feverish moment: there is no date nor address.... The writing is shaky--\"    And M. Desmalions read out:    \"MONSIEUR LE PREFET:    \"A great danger is hanging over my head and over the head of my son.  Death is approaching apace. I shall have to-night, or to-morrow morning  at the latest, the proofs of the abominable plot that threatens us. I ask  leave to bring them to you in the course of the morning. I am in need of  protection and I call for your assistance.    \"Permit me to be, etc. FAUVILLE.\"    \"No other designation?\" asked Perenna. \"No letter-heading?\"    \"None. But there is no mistake. Inspector Verot's declarations agree too  evidently with this despairing appeal. It is clearly M. Fauville and his  son who are to be murdered to-night. And the terrible thing is that, as  this name of Fauville is a very common one, it is impossible for our  inquiries to succeed in time.\"    \"What, Monsieur le Prefet? Surely, by straining every nerve--\"    \"Certainly, we will strain every nerve; and I shall set all my men to  work. But observe that we have not the slightest clue.\"    \"Oh, it would be awful!\" cried Don Luis. \"Those two creatures doomed to  death; and we unable to save them! Monsieur le Prefet, I ask you to  authorize me--\"    He had not finished speaking when the Prefect's private secretary entered  with a visiting-card in his hand.    \"Monsieur le Prefet, this caller was so persistent.... I hesitated--\"    M. Desmalions took the card and uttered an exclamation of mingled  surprise and joy.    \"Look, Monsieur,\" he said to Perenna.    And he handed him the card.     _Hippolyte Fauville,     Civil Engineer.  14 bis Boulevard Suchet._    \"Come,\" said M. Desmalions, \"chance is favouring us. If this M. Fauville  is one of the Roussel heirs, our task becomes very much easier.\"    \"In any case, Monsieur le Prefet,\" the solicitor interposed, \"I must  remind you that one of the clauses of the will stipulates that it shall  not be read until forty-eight hours have elapsed. M. Fauville, therefore,  must not be informed--\"    The door was pushed open and a man hustled the messenger aside and  rushed in.    \"Inspector ... Inspector Verot?\" he spluttered. \"He's dead, isn't he? I  was told--\"    \"Yes, Monsieur, he is dead.\"    \"Too late! I'm too late!\" he stammered.    And he sank into a chair, clasping his hands and sobbing:    \"Oh, the scoundrels! the scoundrels!\"    He was a pale, hollow-cheeked, sickly looking man of about fifty.  His head was bald, above a forehead lined with deep wrinkles. A  nervous twitching affected his chin and the lobes of his ears. Tears  stood in his eyes.    The Prefect asked:    \"Whom do you mean, Monsieur? Inspector Verot's murderers? Are you able to  name them, to assist our inquiry?\"    Hippolyte Fauville shook his head.    \"No, no, it would be useless, for the moment.... My proofs would not be  sufficient.... No, really not.\"    He had already risen from his chair and stood apologizing:    \"Monsieur le Prefet, I have disturbed you unnecessarily, but I wanted to  know.... I was hoping that Inspector Verot might have escaped.... His  evidence, joined to mine, would have been invaluable. But perhaps he was  able to tell you?\"    \"No, he spoke of this evening--of to-night--\"    Hippolyte Fauville started.    \"This evening! Then the time has come!... But no, it's impossible, they  can't do anything to me yet.... They are not ready--\"    \"Inspector Verot declared, however, that the double murder would be  committed to-night.\"    \"No, Monsieur le Prefet, he was wrong there.... I know all about  it.... To-morrow evening at the earliest ... and we will catch them in a  trap.... Oh, the scoundrels!\"    Don Luis went up to him and asked:    \"Your mother's name was Ermeline Roussel, was it not?\"    \"Yes, Ermeline Roussel. She is dead now.\"    \"And she was from Saint-Etienne?\"    \"Yes. But why these questions?\"    \"Monsieur le Prefet will tell you to-morrow. One word more.\" He opened  the cardboard box left by Inspector Verot. \"Does this cake of chocolate  mean anything to you? These marks?\"    \"Oh, how awful!\" said the civil engineer, in a hoarse tone. \"Where did  the inspector find it?\"    He dropped into his chair again, but only for a moment; then, drawing  himself up, he hurried toward the door with a jerky step.    \"I'm going, Monsieur le Prefet, I'm going. To-morrow morning I'll show  you.... I shall have all the proofs.... And the police will protect  me.... I am ill, I know, but I want to live! I have the right to  live ... and my son, too.... And we will live.... Oh, the scoundrels!--\"    And he ran, stumbling out, like a drunken man.    M. Desmalions rose hastily.    \"I shall have inquiries made about that man's circumstances.... I shall  have his house watched. I've telephoned to the detective office already.  I'm expecting some one in whom I have every confidence.\"    Don Luis said:    \"Monsieur le Prefet, I beg you, with an earnestness which you will  understand, to authorize me to pursue the investigation. Cosmo  Mornington's will makes it my duty and, allow me to say, gives me the  right to do so. M. Fauville's enemies have given proofs of extraordinary  cleverness and daring. I want to have the honour of being at the post of  danger to-night, at M. Fauville's house, near his person.\"    The Prefect hesitated. He was bound to reflect how greatly to Don Luis  Perenna's interest it was that none of the Mornington heirs should be  discovered, or at least be able to come between him and the millions  of the inheritance. Was it safe to attribute to a noble sentiment of  gratitude, to a lofty conception of friendship and duty, that strange  longing to protect Hippolyte Fauville against the death that  threatened him?    For some seconds M. Desmalions watched that resolute face, those  intelligent eyes, at once innocent and satirical, grave and smiling, eyes  through which you could certainly not penetrate their owner's baffling  individuality, but which nevertheless looked at you with an expression of  absolute frankness and sincerity. Then he called his secretary:    \"Has any one come from the detective office?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet; Sergeant Mazeroux is here.\"    \"Please have him shown in.\"    And, turning to Perenna:    \"Sergeant Mazeroux is one of our smartest detectives. I used to employ  him together with that poor Verot when I wanted any one more than  ordinarily active and sharp. He will be of great use to you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Sergeant Mazeroux entered. He was a short, lean, wiry man, whose drooping  moustache, heavy eyelids, watery eyes and long, lank hair gave him a most  doleful appearance.    \"Mazeroux,\" said the Prefect, \"you will have heard, by this time, of your  comrade Verot's death and of the horrible circumstances attending it. We  must now avenge him and prevent further crimes. This gentleman, who knows  the case from end to end, will explain all that is necessary. You will"]]]
