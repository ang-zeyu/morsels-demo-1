Bourbon is immovable; and in revenge upon the  Court, he falls in with a private scheme of Gonzales, which is to accept  of his liberty, and set off to the Court of Spain. The undisguising of the  treacherous monk is in these powerful lines:    GONZALES.      Now,    That day is come, ay, and that very hour:    Now shout your war-cry; now unsheath your sword;    I'll join the din, and make these tottering walls    Tremble and nod to hear our fierce defiance.    Nay, never start, and look upon my cowl--    You love not priests, De Bourbon, more than I.    Off, vile denial of my manhood's pride;    Off, off to hell! where thou wast first invented,    Now once again I stand and breathe a knight.    Nay, stay not gazing thus: it is Garcia,    Whose name hath reach'd thee long ere now, I trow;    Whom thou hast met in deadly fight full oft,    When France and Spain join'd in the battle field.    Beyond the Pyrenean boundary    That guards thy land, are forty thousand men:    Their unfurl'd pennons flout fair France's sun,    And wanton in the breezes of her sky:    Impatient halt they there; their foaming steeds,    Pawing the huge and rock-built barrier,    That bars their further course--they wait for thee:    For thee whom France hath injur'd and cast off;    For thee, whose blood it pays with shameful chains,    More shameful death; for thee, whom Charles of Spain    Summons to head his host, and lead them on    To conquest and to glory.    The interest now reverts to the fate of Francoise, and Bourbon is lost  sight of; a transition which, both in acting and reading, endangers the  drama.[1] News arrives of the flight of Lautrec from his government; of  his arrest, his imprisonment, and capital condemnation.[2] He enjoins his  sister to intercede in his behalf with Francis; she complies, but it is at  the expense of her honour; broken-hearted, she sinks beneath her shame at  the crime into which she has been betrayed, and returns home. Francis  pursues her, and the Queen, now aware of his passion for her, dispatches  the monk Gonzales on a secret mission to poison Francoise, who, she fears,  may supplant her in her ascendancy over the King. A fine passage occurs in  the scene wherein the Queen proposes her scheme to Gonzales.    QUEEN.      Didst ever look upon the dead?    GONZALES.      Ay, madam,    Full oft; and in each calm or frightful guise    Death comes in,--on the bloody battle-field;    When with each gush of black and curdling life    A curse was uttered,--when the pray'rs I've pour'd,    Have been all drown'd with din of clashing arms--    And shrieks and shouts, and loud artillery,    That shook the slipp'ry earth, all drunk with gore--    I've seen it, swoll'n with subtle poison, black    And staring with concentrate agony--    When ev'ry vein hath started from its bed,    And wreath'd like knotted snakes, around the brows    That, frantic, dash'd themselves in tortures down    Upon the earth. I've seen life float away    On the faint sound of a far tolling bell--    Leaving its late warm tenement as fair,    As though 'twere th' incorruptible that lay    Before me--and all earthly taint had vanish'd    With the departed spirit.    Laval returns from Italy to claim his bride. In the earlier part of the  play, a hint is given of Gonzales' rancorous hate of Laval, the  undercurrent of which is now revealed. Gonzales, beneath the seal of  confession, obtains the secret of the crime of Francoise. In her presence,  as the betrothed Laval rushes to embrace his bride, he taunts him with her  guilt. The wretched Francoise, in vain conjured to assert her innocence,  stabs herself. The King had been followed thither by the Queen; both now  appear. Gonzales riots revenge in one of the most vigorous portions of the  drama:    GONZALES.      Look on thy bride! look on that faded thing,    That e'en the tears thy manhood showers go fast,    And bravely, cannot wake to life again!    I call all nature to bear witness here--    As fair a flower once grew within my home,    As young, as lovely, and as dearly lov'd--    I had a sister once, a gentle maid--    The only daughter of my father's house,    Round whom our ruder loves did all entwine,    As round the dearest treasure that we own'd.    She was the centre of our souls' affections--    She was the bud, that underneath our strong    And sheltering arms, spread over her, did blow.    So grew this fair, fair girl, till envious fate    Brought on the hour when she was withered.    Thy father, sir--now mark--for 'tis the point    And moral of my tale--thy father, then,    Was, by my sire, in war ta'en prisoner--    Wounded almost to death, he brought him home,    Shelter'd him,--cherish'd him,--and, with a care,    Most like a brother's, watch'd his bed of sickness,    Till ruddy health, once more through all his veins    Sent life's warm stream in strong returning tide.    How think ye he repaid my father's love?    From her dear home he lur'd my sister forth,    And, having robb'd her of her treasur'd honour,    Cast her away, defil'd,--despoil'd--forsaken--    The daughter of a high and ancient line--    The child of so much love--she died--she died--    Upon the threshold of that home, from which    My father spurn'd her--over whose pale corse    I swore to hunt, through life, her ravisher--    Nor ever from by bloodhound track desist,    Till line and deep atonement had been made--    Honour for honour given--blood for blood.      \"The Queen orders Gonzales to death; but the monk accuses her of the  intended murder of Francoise, and produces her written order to that  effect. The King can no longer be blind to his mother's crimes; she is  disgraced, degraded, and condemned to pass the rest of her days in a  convent.\"    Here the fourth act, and the acting play closes. In the fifth De Bourbon  reappears. Lautrec proposes to join him, and assassinate the King, in  revenge for the ruin of Francoise. The memorable battle of Pavia ensues,  and terminates with the death of the King and the triumph of Bourbon.    Triboulet, the jester of the Court of Francis, is introduced with some  pleasantry, by way of relief to the darker deeds.    We cannot conclude this imperfect sketch better than by the following  judicious observations from the _Quarterly Review_: \"How high Miss Kemble's  young aspirings have been--what conceptions she has formed to herself of  the dignity of tragic poetry--may be discovered from this most remarkable  work; at this height she must maintain herself, or soar a still bolder  flight. The turmoil, the hurry, the business, the toil, even the celebrity  of a theatric life must yield her up at times to that repose, that  undistracted retirement within her own mind, which, however brief,  is essential to the perfection of the noblest work of the  imagination--genuine tragedy. Amidst her highest successes on the stage,  she must remember that the world regards her as one to whom a still higher  part is fallen. She must not be content with the fame of the most  extraordinary work which has ever been produced by a female at her age,  (for as such we scruple not to describe her Francis the First,)--with  having sprung at once to the foremost rank, not only of living actors but  of modern dramatists;--she must consider that she has given us a pledge  and earnest for a long and brightening course of distinction, in the  devotion of all but unrivalled talents in two distinct, though congenial,  capacities, to the revival of the waning glories of the English theatre.\"      [1] This disadvantage is greater on the stage, since the audience neither      see nor hear more of Bourbon, and only four acts of the piece are      performed. In the closet it will not be so obvious, as Bourbon      returns in the fifth act.    [2] This is an entire variation from history.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      OLD ENGLISH MUSIC.    It was in the course of the sixteenth century that the psalmody of England,  and the other Protestant countries, was brought to the state in which it  now remains, and in which it is desirable that it should continue to  remain. For this psalmody we are indebted to the Reformers of Germany,  especially Luther, who was himself an enthusiastic lover of music, and is  believed to have composed some of the finest tunes, particularly the  Hundredth Psalm, and the hymn on the Last Judgment, which Braham sings  with such tremendous power at our great performances of sacred music. Our  psalm-tunes, consisting of prolonged and simple sounds, are admirably  adapted for being sung by great congregations; and as the effect of this  kind of music is much increased by its venerable antiquity, it would be  very unfortunate should it yield to the influence of innovation: for this  reason, it is much to be desired that organists and directors of choirs  should confine themselves to the established old tunes, instead of  displacing them by modern compositions.    Towards the end of the sixteenth, and beginning of the seventeenth,  century, shone that constellation of English musicians, whose inimitable  madrigals are still, and long will be, the delight of every lover of vocal  harmony. It is to Italy, however, that we are indebted for this species of  composition. The madrigal is a piece of vocal music adapted to words of an  amorous or cheerful cast, composed for four, five, or six voices, and  intended for performance in convivial parties or private musical societies.  It is full of ingenious and elaborate contrivances; but, in the happier  specimens, contains likewise agreeable and expressive melody. At the  period of which we now speak, vocal harmony was so generally cultivated,  that, in social parties, the madrigal books were generally laid on the  table, and every one was expected to take the part allotted to him. Any  person who made the avowal of not being able to sing a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11743"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 19, No. 548, May (#6)"],[1,"sentence on his proceedings, it was a signal for  ill-humour for the remainder of the day; or rather till the spoiled  child would condescend to be coaxed into a more satisfactory mood of  mind.\"    But we are more struck with the appalling fidelity of the following  scene in a tale named _the Divorcee_. The heroine, Amelia, is married  in early life to a Mr. Allanby, \"a man with 10,000l. per annum,  and a grey pigtail:\" the match turns out a miserable one: Amelia's  dishonour by Vavasor Kendal, her divorce, and Mr. Allanby's death are  told in a few pages--the guilty pair, Vavasor and Amelia, flee to  Paris, and we are introduced to this faithful picture of Parisian  vice:--    \"The infirmity of Amelia's health served at least to release her from  those forced efforts of gaiety which had recoiled so heavily on her  feelings. Her day for vivacity was gone.--In an atmosphere whose  buoyancy is exhausted, the feather falls as heavily as the plummet.    \"But instead of commiserating the languor and feebleness extending  from the physical to the moral existence of the invalid, Vavasor only  made her dulness an excuse for flying to the relief of society more  congenial with his own tendency to vice and folly. Lady Emlyn who  in London was the leader of a coterie devoted to the excitements of  high-play,--a coterie that felt privileged to inveigh with horror  against 'gambling,' because its members ventured their thousands  on games where cunning tempers the fortuities of chance,--on the  manoeuvres of ecarte and whist instead of the dare-all risks of  hazard and rouge-et-noir,--had now removed her card-table from  Grosvenor-square to a splendid hotel in the Rue Rivoli; where she had  the honour of assembling, twice a week, a larger proportion of the  idle and licentious of the exclusive caste, than could be found in any  other suite of drawing-rooms in civilized Europe. Her _salon_ was in  fact crowded with busy ranks of those swindlers of distinction who,  in opposition to their brethren of lower pretensions, (the chevaliers  d'industrie), ought surely to be termed the chevaliers de la paresse.  Among these, the brilliant air and lively effrontery of Captain Kendal  secured him a warm acceptance; and by frequenting the circle of Lady  Emlyn, he had not only the gratification of escaping from the insipid  mediocrity of the home his vices had created, but acquired the power  of indulging in others which were now still dearer to his heart.    \"Vavasor Kendal was an expert player. Like other frigid egotists, his  head and heart were always at leisure; and his successes had been  the means, on more than one occasion, of extending his means of  disgraceful enjoyment. At least, however, his career lay on the  verge of a precipice; for playing at a stake beyond the limit of his  fortune, a single faltering step might at any hour precipitate him  into an abyss of shame and ruin. Amelia was often tempted to doubt  whether she had more cause to dread that intoxication of triumph,  which induced him to still further excesses, or the reverses tending  to aggravate the violence of temper to which she was an habitual  victim. The fluctuating fortunes of the gamester,--his losses or  gains,--were equally a source of suffering to herself. But the  Carnival was drawing to a close; she soon began ardently to wish that  his sister might grow weary of the increasing dulness of the French  capital, and migrate among other swallows of the season, in search of  new pleasures.    \"Long had she been in expectation of an announcement to this effect,  when one night,--a cold cheerless night in March,--Vavasor exceeded  even his ordinary period of absence. The habitually dissolute of Paris  rarely keep late hours. Vice does not form with _them_, as with the  English _roue_, an occasional excess, but is consistent and regular  in its habits. Captain Kendal usually returned home between two and  three; and Amelia was accustomed to sit up, and by her own services  lighten the labours of their scanty establishment. It was _she_, the  invalid, who was careful to keep up light and fire for the tyrant of  the domestic hearth.    \"But on this occasion two o'clock came,--three, four, five  o'clock,--and no Vavasor. Hour after hour she listened to the chime of  the gaudy timepiece decorating their shabby apartment; and while the  night advanced, in all its chilly, lonely, comfortless protraction,  shivered as she added new logs to the dying embers, and as she hoped  or despaired of his return, alternately replaced the veilleuse by  candles, the candles by a veilleuse. She had already assumed her  night-apparel; and alter wandering like an unquiet spirit from her own  apartment to the sitting-room and back again, a thousand, thousand  times,--after reclining her exhausted frame and throbbing head against  the door of the ante-room, in the trust of catching the sound of his  well-known step upon the stairs, she threw herself down on the  sofa for a moment's respite. But in a few minutes she started up  again.--Surely that was _his_ voice, which reached her from some  passenger in the street below, some passenger humming an air from the  new Opera, according to Vavasor's custom, when returning flushed with  the excitement of success? Again and hurriedly did she prepare for his  reception,--again place his chair by the fire, his slippers beside  it; and stand with a beating heart and suspended breath, to await the  entrance of the truant. But, no! it was _not_ him. The wanderer had  hastened onwards to some happier home. The street was quiet again. She  would take a book and strive to beguile the tediousness of suspense.    \"Dreary indeed is that hour of the twenty-four which may be said to  afford the true division between night and day; when even the latest  watcher has retired to rest, while the earliest artisans scarcely  yet rouse themselves for the renewal of their struggle with  existence;--when even the studious, the sorrowing, and the dissipated,  close their over-wearied eyes;--and when those who 'do lack, and  suffer hunger,' enjoy that Heaven-vouchsafed stupor affording the only  interim to their consciousness of want and woe. The winds whistle more  shrilly in the stillness of that lonely hour. Man and beast are in  their lair, and unearthly things alone seem stirring;--the good genius  glides with a holy and hallowing influence through the tranquil  dwelling of virtue; the demon grins and gibbers in the deserted but  reeking chambers of the vicious. Even sorrow has phantoms of its own;  and when Amelia found herself a lonely watcher in the stillness of  night, the kind voice of old Allanby,--the voice that was wont of yore  to bid her speak her bosom's wish that it might be granted,--often  seemed creeping into the inmost cell of her ear. She could fancy him  close beside her,--taunting her,--touching her,--till, starting from  her seat, she strove to shake off the hideous delusion. Sometimes  the soft cordial tones of her mother,--her mother, who was in the  grave,--seemed again dispensing those lessons of virtue of which  her own life had afforded so pure an example: sometimes the playful  caresses of her boys seemed to grow warm upon her lips--around her  neck. Yes! she could hear them, see them:--little Charles, who, in  his very babyhood, had been accustomed to uplift his tiny arm in  championship of his own dear mother;--Digby, the soft, tender,  loving infant, whose every look was a smile, whose every action an  endearment!--And now they appeared to pass before her as strangers;  changed--matured--enlightened;--without one word of fondness--one  gesture of recognition!    \"From such meditations, how horrible to start up amid the dreariness  of night, nor find a human heart unto which to appeal for comfort,--a  human voice from which to claim reply in annihilation of the spell  that transfixed her mind. The cold cheerless room, the flickering  light, the desolation that was around her, struck more heavily than  ever on her heart. 'Oh! that this were an omen!' she cried, with  clasping hands, as she listened to the howling of the wind upon the  lofty staircase leading to their remote apartments. Drawing closer  over her bosom the wrapper by which she attempted to exclude the  piercing night-air, Amelia smiled at the thought of the chilliness of  the grave,--of the grave, where the heart beats not, and the fixed  glassy eye is incapable of tears.    \"'I shall lie among the multitudes of a strange country,' faltered  she; 'there will be no one to point out with officious finger to my  sons, the dishonoured resting-place of their mother,--their _divorced_  mother! Vavasor will be freed from his bondage--free to choose anew,  and commence H more auspicious career. But for me he might have been a  different being. It is _I_ who have hardened his heart and seared his  mind. And oh! may Heaven in its mercy touch them,--that he may deal  gently with me during the last short remnant of our union!'    \"A harsh sound interrupted her contemplations;--the grating of his key  in the outer door,--of his step in the ante-room. Mechanically she  rose, and advanced to meet the truant who had kept her watching,--who  had so _often_ kept her watching,--so often been forgiven. A momentary  glimpse of his countenance convinced her that he was in no mood even  to wish for indulgence. His brow was black--his eyes red and glaring.  After a terrified pause, she tendered him her assistance to unclasp  his cloak; but with a deadly execration he rejected the offer.    \"'Are the servants up?' said he sullenly.    \"'Not yet.'    \"'So much the better! I must be off before they are on the move.'    \"'Off? Vavasor!--for the love of Heaven--'    \"'Be still! Do not harass me with your nonsense. I was a fool to come  here at all; only it may be necessary for you to know explicitly to  what you may trust for the future.'    \"Amelia sank stupefied into a chair.    \"'In"]]]
