The only way out of the fight  was to end it, and he set about trying to accomplish that with as little  delay as possible.    Once Diamond succeeded in getting in another blow, and it left a slight  swelling over one of the other lad's eyes.    But Merriwell did not seem to know that he had been hit. He soon cracked  the Virginian upon the uninjured eye, and that began to swell. In a few  seconds it seemed that Diamond must soon go blind.    \"Finish him, old man--finish him!\" urged Harry.    Frank was looking for the chance, but it was some time before he found  it. It came at last, and his left landed on the jaw beneath Diamond's  ear.    Over went the Southerner, and he lay like a log where he fell.    At a glance, it was evident to all that he was knocked out.    The boys crowded around Merriwell, eager to congratulate him, but he  thrust them back, saying:    \"It's the first time in my life I ever did a thing of which I was  ashamed! Look after him. I'm all right.\"    \"Say!\" exploded Harry Rattleton, \"you make me sick! Didn't you have to  do it?\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"Didn't he strike you foul twice?\"    \"He knows nothing of rules, and we were fighting by no rules, so there  could be no foul.\"    \"Oh, no! If he'd soaked you with a brick you'd said it was all right! I  say, you make me sick! Wait till he gets a good chance to do you, and  see how quick he will take it.\"    \"He'll not be to blame if he tries to get square.\"    \"Oh, go hoke your sed--I mean soak your head! I'll catch you some time  when you are asleep and try to pound a little sense into you.\"    \"Well, take care of Diamond,\" ordered Merriwell. \"That last one I gave  him was a beastly thump.\"    \"Let the other fellows take care of him,\" said Harry. \"We'll rub you  down. You need it. Got any towels, Mr. Horner?\"    \"Guess we can find one or two,\" cheerfully answered Tad. \"Come on,  Merriwell. We'll fix you up.\"    Frank followed them into the room where the captured freshmen had been  confined, and there they found running water, an old iron sink, a tin  wash basin, and some towels.    The visitor was stripped and given a brisk and thorough rubbing and  sponging by Harry and Tad.    Bruce Browning, with his mask still over his face, came loafing in and  looked the stripped freshman over with a critical eye. He inspected  Frank from all sides, poked him with his fingers, felt of his arms and  legs, surveyed the muscles of his back and chest, and then stood off and  took him all in at a glance.    \"Humph!\" he grunted.    Frank's delicate pink skin glowed, and he looked a perfect Apollo, with  a splendid head poised upon a white, shapely neck. Never had he looked  handsomer in all his life than he did at that moment, stripped to the  buff, his brown hair frowsled, his body glowing from the rubbing.    \"By Jove!\" cried Tad Horner, who was sometimes called Baby, \"he's a Jim  Hickey--eh, old man?\"    The interrogation was directed at Browning.    \"Humph!\" grunted Bruce, and then with his hands in his pockets he loafed  out of the room.    Afterward it was reported that Browning said the freshman was the  finest-put-up chap he had ever seen, but he didn't want to give him the  swelled head by telling him so.    By the time Merriwell was well rubbed down one of the freshmen came in  and reported that Diamond had come around all right.    \"They're going to bring him in here and give him a rubbing,\" said the  freshman.    Frank hastened to get into his clothes, in order that Diamond might have  a chance. Rattleton had brushed the dirt and sawdust off those clothes,  so they looked pretty well, and Merriwell showed no traces of what he  had passed through when he stepped out of the little room.    Some of the boys were trying to induce Diamond to be rubbed down, but he  objected, declaring he was going directly to his room. The blood had  been washed from his face, and one or two cuts had been patched up with  court-plaster, but his eyes were nearly closed, and he presented a  pitiful appearance.    Frank hesitated a moment, and then he stepped up to his foe, saying in a  manner most sincere:    \"Old man, I am sorry this affair took place. I had the advantage,  because I have taken boxing lessons, but you made a beautiful fight. I  hold no hard feelings. Let's call it quits and shake.\"    He held out his hand.    Diamond's reply was to turn his back squarely on the proffered hand.    An additional flush arose to Merriwell's cheeks, and he dropped his hand  by his side, turning away without another word.    A few moments later Diamond left the building, accompanied by a single  companion, and that companion was not Roland Ditson.    Ditson remained behind, and he was among those who crowded about Frank  Merriwell and offered congratulations.    \"I was Diamond's second,\" said Roll, \"but I am satisfied that the best  man won. He is no match for you, Merriwell. I shouldn't have been his  second, only he urged me to. I was glad to see you do him up.\"    He got hold of Frank's hand and held on, but received no friendly  pressure in return. When he said he was glad that Merriwell did Diamond  up Frank looked incredulous.    \"As for me,\" said the victor, \"I was sorry to have to do him up.\"    Somewhere about the place Rattleton had found an old floral decoration  representing a harp. He brought it forward and presented it to Frank.    \"Take it,\" he said. \"You'll need it pretty soon. Your wings must be  sprouting already!\"    \"What is it?\" asked Frank.    \"Why, can't you see? It's a harp.\"    \"It looks to me like a blasted lyre,\" said Merriwell. \"You'd better give  it to Ditson.\"    Then everybody but Ditson laughed.          CHAPTER VI.    A FRESH COUNCIL.      Diamond was in a wretched condition. Hunk Collins, his roommate,  procured two slices of fresh beefsteak, and the Virginian had them bound  over his eyes, while his face was bathed with soothing and healing  lotions; but nothing could soothe his bruised and battered spirit, and  Collins said he was kept awake all night by hearing Diamond grind his  teeth at irregular intervals.    Even when he slept near morning the Southerner continued to grind his  strong white teeth.    Collins was dropping off to sleep from sheer weariness when he awoke to  find his roommate astride him and clutching him by the throat.    \"This time I'll fix you!\" mumbled Diamond, thickly. \"I'll kill you,  Merriwell--I'll kill you!\"    Then he struck feeby at Collins, who rolled over and flung him off. They  grappled, and it was a severe struggle before Diamond was flung down on  the bed and held.    \"What in thunder is the matter with you?\" gasped Collins, whose hair  was standing. \"I'm not Merriwell! Have you gone daft?\"    \"Where are we?\"    \"Why, in our room, of course. Where did you think we were?\"    \"I didn't know. I was dreaming.\"    \"Well, if you are going to be this way often, I'll have to take out a  life insurance policy or quit you.\"    \"Don't mind. I'll be all right in the morning. Oh, hang the luck!\"    Then the passionate Southerner turned over with his face toward the  wall. Collins smoked a cigarette to quiet his nerves, after which he got  into bed once more. At intervals he could feel the bed shake, and he  knew Diamond was shivering as if he had a chill.    In the morning Diamond was not all right. He was ill in bed, and it was  necessary to call a physician, although he protested against it. His  eyes were in wretched shape, but when the doctor questioned him, he  persisted in saying he had injured them by falling downstairs.    Of course he could not appear at chapel or recitations, and he sent in  an excuse.    Then Mr. Lovejoy came around to investigate.    Now, Mr. Lovejoy was most mild and lamblike in appearance, and one would  have thought never in all his life had he indulged in anything that was  not perfectly proper.    But appearances were deceptive in the case of Mr. Lovejoy. When a  student at Yale he had made a record, but he had been fortunate, and he  was never detected in anything the faculty could not approve. By those  who knew him he was regarded as a terror, and by the faculty he was  looked on as one of the most quiet and docile students in college.    When Cyrus Lovejoy became an instructor he did not forget the days when  he had been a leader in scrapes of all sorts, and he was not inclined to  be prying into the affairs of students under him. Not only that, but he  could be blind to some things he accidentally discovered.    So when Mr. Lovejoy reported that John Diamond's eyes, being naturally  weak, were inflamed by too close application to his studies, especially  in the evening, no one thought of investigating further. The doctor, it  was said, had forbidden Diamond to attempt to study for several days,  and had ordered him to wear a bandage over his eyes.    Two or three evenings after the fight a party of freshmen gathered in  Merriwell's room, for they were beginning to realize that Frank was  likely to be a leader among them.    \"I say, fellows,\" cried Dan Dorman, who was sitting on the sill of the  open window, with a cigarette clinging to his lips, \"do you know what  Diamond is doing?\"    \"He's doing his best to cure those beautiful eyes of his,\" said Bandy  Robinson.    \"I'm giving it to you straight that he was out to-day and went down to  the nearest gun store,\" declared Dorman. \"Collins says he bought a  Winchester rifle, a shotgun, two revolvers, a bowie knife, a slungshot,  and a set of brass knuckles.\"    \"Wo-o-oh!\" groaned Dismal Jones. \"Why didn't he purchase a cannon and  start for some battlefield?\"    \"Look out, Merry,\" laughed Ned Stover. \"He's after your scalp.\"    \"He'll have to get a bigger outfit than that before he takes it,\"  declared Harry Rattleton.    \"How about it, Merry?\" asked Bandy Robinson.    \"I'll tell you, fellows,\" said Frank, who was not smoking. \"Diamond is  not the fellow to give up whipped very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#6)"],[1," is my soul that calls upon my name.      How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,      Like softest music to attending ears!      Jul. Romeo!      Rom. My dear?      Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow      Shall I send to thee?      Rom. By the hour of nine.      Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.      I have forgot why I did call thee back.      Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.      Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,      Rememb'ring how I love thy company.      Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,      Forgetting any other home but this.      Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-      And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,      That lets it hop a little from her hand,      Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,      And with a silk thread plucks it back again,      So loving-jealous of his liberty.      Rom. I would I were thy bird.      Jul. Sweet, so would I.      Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.      Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,      That I shall say good night till it be morrow.                                                           [Exit.]      Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!      Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!      Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,      His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.   Exit          Scene III.  Friar Laurence's cell.    Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.        Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,      Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;      And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels      From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.      Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye      The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,      I must up-fill this osier cage of ours      With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.      The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.      What is her burying gave, that is her womb;      And from her womb children of divers kind      We sucking on her natural bosom find;      Many for many virtues excellent,      None but for some, and yet all different.      O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies      In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;      For naught so vile that on the earth doth live      But to the earth some special good doth give;      Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,      Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.      Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,      And vice sometime's by action dignified.      Within the infant rind of this small flower      Poison hath residence, and medicine power;      For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;      Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.      Two such opposed kings encamp them still      In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;      And where the worser is predominant,      Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.                            Enter Romeo.        Rom. Good morrow, father.      Friar. Benedicite!      What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?      Young son, it argues a distempered head      So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.      Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,      And where care lodges sleep will never lie;      But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain      Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.      Therefore thy earliness doth me assure      Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;      Or if not so, then here I hit it right-      Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.      Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.      Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?      Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.      I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.      Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?      Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.      I have been feasting with mine enemy,      Where on a sudden one hath wounded me      That's by me wounded. Both our remedies      Within thy help and holy physic lies.      I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,      My intercession likewise steads my foe.      Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift      Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.      Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set      On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;      As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,      And all combin'd, save what thou must combine      By holy marriage. When, and where, and how      We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,      I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,      That thou consent to marry us to-day.      Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!      Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,      So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies      Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.      Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine      Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!      How much salt water thrown away in waste,      To season love, that of it doth not taste!      The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,      Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.      Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit      Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.      If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,      Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.      And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:      Women may fall when there's no strength in men.      Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.      Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.      Rom. And bad'st me bury love.      Friar. Not in a grave      To lay one in, another out to have.      Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now      Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.      The other did not so.      Friar. O, she knew well      Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.      But come, young waverer, come go with me.      In one respect I'll thy assistant be;      For this alliance may so happy prove      To turn your households' rancour to pure love.      Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.      Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene IV.  A street.    Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.        Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?      Came he not home to-night?      Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.      Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,      Torments him so that he will sure run mad.      Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,      Hath sent a letter to his father's house.      Mer. A challenge, on my life.      Ben. Romeo will answer it.      Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.      Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,      being dared.      Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white      wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the      very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's      butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?      Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?      Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the      courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing      pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his      minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very      butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman      of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the      immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.      Ben. The what?      Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-      these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very      tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,      grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange      flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand      so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old      bench? O, their bones, their bones!                                   Enter Romeo.        Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!      Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how      art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch      flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she      had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,      Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,      but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French      salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit      fairly last night.      Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?      Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?      Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a      case as mine a man may strain courtesy.      Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a      man to bow in the hams.      Rom. Meaning, to cursy.      Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.      Rom. A most courteous exposition.      Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.      Rom. Pink for flower.      Mer. Right.      Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.      Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out      thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may      remain, after the wearing, solely singular.      Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!      Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.      Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.      Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for      thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am      sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?      Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not      there for the goose.      Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.      Rom. "]]]
