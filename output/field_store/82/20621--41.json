When the child at last understood, she  was silent for a moment, and then she spoke: \"I will be good,\" she  said. The words were something more than a conventional protestation,  something more than the expression of a superimposed desire; they  were, in their limitation and their intensity, their egotism and their  humility, an instinctive summary of the dominating qualities of a life.  \"I cried much on learning it,\" her Majesty noted long afterwards. No  doubt, while the others were present, even her dear Lehzen, the little  girl kept up her self-command; and then crept away somewhere to ease her  heart of an inward, unfamiliar agitation, with a handkerchief, out of  her mother's sight.    But her mother's sight was by no means an easy thing to escape. Morning  and evening, day and night, there was no relaxation of the maternal  vigilance. The child grew into the girl, the girl into the young woman;  but still she slept in her mother's bedroom; still she had no place  allowed her where she might sit or work by herself. An extraordinary  watchfulness surrounded her every step: up to the day of her accession,  she never went downstairs without someone beside her holding her hand.  Plainness and regularity ruled the household. The hours, the days, the  years passed slowly and methodically by. The dolls--the innumerable  dolls, each one so neatly dressed, each one with its name so  punctiliously entered in the catalogue--were laid aside, and a little  music and a little dancing took their place. Taglioni came, to give  grace and dignity to the figure, and Lablache, to train the piping  treble upon his own rich bass. The Dean of Chester, the official  preceptor, continued his endless instruction in Scripture history, while  the Duchess of Northumberland, the official governess, presided over  every lesson with becoming solemnity. Without doubt, the Princess's main  achievement during her school-days was linguistic. German was naturally  the first language with which she was familiar; but English and French  quickly followed; and she became virtually trilingual, though her  mastery of English grammar remained incomplete. At the same time, she  acquired a working knowledge of Italian and some smattering of Latin.  Nevertheless, she did not read very much. It was not an occupation that  she cared for; partly, perhaps, because the books that were given her  were all either sermons, which were very dull, or poetry, which was  incomprehensible. Novels were strictly forbidden. Lord Durham persuaded  her mother to get her some of Miss Martineau's tales, illustrating the  truths of Political Economy, and they delighted her; but it is to be  feared that it was the unaccustomed pleasure of the story that filled  her mind, and that she never really mastered the theory of exchanges or  the nature of rent.    It was her misfortune that the mental atmosphere which surrounded her  during these years of adolescence was almost entirely feminine. No  father, no brother, was there to break in upon the gentle monotony of  the daily round with impetuosity, with rudeness, with careless laughter  and wafts of freedom from the outside world. The Princess was never  called by a voice that was loud and growling; never felt, as a matter  of course, a hard rough cheek on her own soft one; never climbed a wall  with a boy. The visits to Claremont--delicious little escapes into male  society--came to an end when she was eleven years old and Prince Leopold  left England to be King of the Belgians. She loved him still; he was  still \"il mio secondo padre or, rather, solo padre, for he is indeed  like my real father, as I have none;\" but his fatherliness now came to  her dimly and indirectly, through the cold channel of correspondence.  Henceforward female duty, female elegance, female enthusiasm, hemmed  her completely in; and her spirit, amid the enclosing folds, was hardly  reached by those two great influences, without which no growing life can  truly prosper--humour and imagination. The Baroness Lehzen--for she had  been raised to that rank in the Hanoverian nobility by George IV before  he died--was the real centre of the Princess's world. When Feodora  married, when Uncle Leopold went to Belgium, the Baroness was left  without a competitor. The Princess gave her mother her dutiful regards;  but Lehzen had her heart. The voluble, shrewd daughter of the pastor  in Hanover, lavishing her devotion on her royal charge, had reaped her  reward in an unbounded confidence and a passionate adoration. The girl  would have gone through fire for her \"PRECIOUS Lehzen,\" the \"best and  truest friend,\" she declared, that she had had since her birth. Her  journal, begun when she was thirteen, where she registered day by day  the small succession of her doings and her sentiments, bears on every  page of it the traces of the Baroness and her circumambient influence.  The young creature that one sees there, self-depicted in ingenuous  clarity, with her sincerity, her simplicity, her quick affections and  pious resolutions, might almost have been the daughter of a German  pastor herself. Her enjoyments, her admirations, her engouements were  of the kind that clothed themselves naturally in underlinings and  exclamation marks. \"It was a DELIGHTFUL ride. We cantered a good deal.  SWEET LITTLE ROSY WENT BEAUTIFULLY!! We came home at a 1/4 past 1... At  20 minutes to 7 we went out to the Opera... Rubini came on and sang a  song out of 'Anna Boulena' QUITE BEAUTIFULLY. We came home at 1/2  past 11.\" In her comments on her readings, the mind of the Baroness is  clearly revealed. One day, by some mistake, she was allowed to take up  a volume of memoirs by Fanny Kemble. \"It is certainly very pertly and  oddly written. One would imagine by the style that the authoress must be  very pert, and not well bred; for there are so many vulgar expressions  in it. It is a great pity that a person endowed with so much talent, as  Mrs. Butler really is, should turn it to so little account and publish a  book which is so full of trash and nonsense which can only do her harm.  I stayed up till 20 minutes past 9.\" Madame de Sevigne's letters, which  the Baroness read aloud, met with more approval. \"How truly elegant and  natural her style is! It is so full of naivete, cleverness, and grace.\"  But her highest admiration was reserved for the Bishop of Chester's  'Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew.' \"It is a very fine  book indeed. Just the sort of one I like; which is just plain and  comprehensible and full of truth and good feeling. It is not one  of those learned books in which you have to cavil at almost every  paragraph. Lehzen gave it me on the Sunday that I took the Sacrament.\" A  few weeks previously she had been confirmed, and she described the event  as follows: \"I felt that my confirmation was one of the most solemn and  important events and acts in my life; and that I trusted that it might  have a salutary effect on my mind. I felt deeply repentant for all what  I had done which was wrong and trusted in God Almighty to strengthen my  heart and mind; and to forsake all that is bad and follow all that is  virtuous and right. I went with the firm determination to become a true  Christian, to try and comfort my dear Mamma in all her griefs, trials,  and anxieties, and to become a dutiful and affectionate daughter to her.  Also to be obedient to DEAR Lehzen, who has done so much for me. I was  dressed in a white lace dress, with a white crepe bonnet with a wreath  of white roses round it. I went in the chariot with my dear Mamma and  the others followed in another carriage.\" One seems to hold in one's  hand a small smooth crystal pebble, without a flaw and without a  scintillation, and so transparent that one can see through it at a  glance.    Yet perhaps, after all, to the discerning eye, the purity would not be  absolute. The careful searcher might detect, in the virgin soil, the  first faint traces of an unexpected vein. In that conventual existence  visits were exciting events; and, as the Duchess had many relatives,  they were not infrequent; aunts and uncles would often appear from  Germany, and cousins too. When the Princess was fourteen she was  delighted by the arrival of a couple of boys from Wurtemberg, the  Princes Alexander and Ernst, sons of her mother's sister and the  reigning duke. \"They are both EXTREMELY TALL,\" she noted, \"Alexander  is VERY HANDSOME, and Ernst has a VERY KIND EXPRESSION. They are both  extremely AMIABLE.\" And their departure filled her with corresponding  regrets. \"We saw them get into the barge, and watched them sailing away  for some time on the beach. They were so amiable and so pleasant to  have in the house; they were ALWAYS SATISFIED, ALWAYS GOOD-HUMOURED;  Alexander took such care of me in getting out of the boat, and rode next  to me; so did Ernst.\" Two years later, two other cousins arrived, the  Princes Ferdinand and Augustus. \"Dear Ferdinand,\" the Princess wrote,  \"has elicited universal admiration from all parties... He is so very  unaffected, and has such a very distinguished appearance and carriage.  They are both very dear and charming young men. Augustus is very  amiable, too, and, when known, shows much good sense.\" On another  occasion, \"Dear Ferdinand came and sat near me and talked so dearly and  sensibly. I do SO love him. Dear Augustus sat near me and talked with  me, and he is also a dear good young man, and is very handsome.\" She  could not quite decide which was the handsomer of the two. \"On the  whole,\" she concluded, \"I think Ferdinand handsomer than Augustus, his  eyes are so beautiful, and he has such a lively clever expression; BOTH  have such a sweet expression; Ferdinand has something QUITE BEAUTIFUL in  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12655"],[0,"The Boy Mechanic, Volume 1: 700 Things for Boys to Do (#6)"],[1," to do this  part of the work.        ** Cheesebox-Cover Tea Tray [18]    The cover from a cheesebox can be converted into a tea tray that  is very dainty for the piazza, or for serving an invalid's  breakfast.    First sandpaper the wood until it is smooth, then stain it a  mahogany color. The mahogany stain can be obtained ready prepared.  After the stain has dried, attach brass handles, which can be  obtained for a small sum at an upholsterer's shop. A round  embroidered doily in the bottom adds to the appearance of the  tray.  --Contributed by Katharine D.

Tack over one end of the hole a piece of pasteboard in  which seven coarse sewing-machine needles have been inserted. The  needles should be close together and pushed through the pasteboard  until the points show. The hole is then filled with melted babbitt  metal. When this is cold, the block is split and the pasteboard  removed. This tool makes neat pierced work and in making brass  shades, it does the work rapidly.  --Contributed by H.

Ii is an ordinary staple, driven in just far enough to  allow a space for the end of an ordinary pointed kitchen knife to  fit in it. The staple is driven in the edge of the chopping board.  The knife can be raised and lowered with one hand, as    [Illustration: Knife Attached to the Board]    the material is passed under the blade with the other. Great  pressure can be applied and the knife will not slip. --Contributed  by M. M.

The stick should be dressed to fit the hole  in the spool snugly and a small brad driven through one end so  that the point will protrude about 1/16 in.    The adjustment of the gauge is secured by driving the stick in the  hole in the direction desired. A better way and one that will make  the adjusting easy is to file the point end of a screw eye flat  and use it as a set screw through a hole in the side of the spool.        ** A Flatiron Rest [19]    The iron rest and wall hanger shown in the sketch is made of sheet  iron. The upturned edges of the metal are    [Illustration: Board or Wall Iron Rest]    bent to fit the sloping sides of the iron. The holder and iron can  be moved at the same time.  --Contributed by W.

WARNECKE    Procure some brass, about 3/16 in. thick and 4 in. square; 53  steel pens, not over 1/4 in. in width at the shank; two enameled,  or tin, saucers or pans, having a diameter on the inside part of  about 4-1/2 in.; two stopcocks with 1/8 in. holes; one shaft; some  pieces of    [Illustration: Details of Turbine]    brass, 1/4 in. thick, and several 1/8-in. machine screws.    Lay out two circles on the 3/16-in. brass, one having a diameter  of 3-1/2 in. and the other with a diameter of 2-3/4 in. The  outside circle is the size of the finished brass wheel, while the  inside circle indicates the depth to which the slots are to be  cut. Mark the point where a hole is to be drilled for the shaft,  also locate the drill holes, as shown at A, Fig. 1. After the  shaft hole and the holes A are drilled in the disk, it can be used  as template for drilling the side plates C.    The rim of the disk is divided into 53 equal parts and radial  lines drawn from rim to line B, indicating the depth of the slots.  Slots are cut in the disk with a hacksaw on the radial lines. A  small vise is convenient for holding the disk while cutting the  slots.    When cutting the disk out of the rough brass, sufficient margin  should be left for filing to the true line. The slots should be  left in their rough state as they have a better hold on the pens  which are used for the blades. The pens are inserted in the slots  and made quite secure by forcing ordinary pins on the inside of  the pens and breaking them off at the rim, as shown in Fig. 4.    When the pens are all fastened two pieces of metal are provided,  each about 1 in. in diameter and 1/32 in. thick, with a 3/8-in.  hole in the center, for filling pieces which are first placed  around the shaft hole between the disk and side plates C, Fig. 1.  The side plates are then secured with some of the 1/8-in. machine  screws, using two nuts on each screw. The nuts should be on the  side opposite the inlet valves. The shaft hole may also be filed  square, a square shaft used, and the ends filed round for the  bearings.    The casing for the disk is made of two enameled-iron saucers, Fig.  2, bolted together with a thin piece of asbestos between them to  make a tight joint. A 3/4-in. hole is cut near the edge of one of  the saucers for the exhaust. If it is desired to carry the exhaust  beyond the casing, a thin pipe can be inserted 1/4 in. into the  hole. Holes are drilled through the pipe on both inside and  outside of the casing, and pins inserted, as shown in Fig. 5.  Solder is run around the outside pin to keep the steam from  escaping. At the lowest point of the saucer or casing a 1/8-in.  hole is drilled to run off the water. A wood plug will answer for  a stopcock.    If metal dishes, shaped from thick material with a good coating of  tin, can be procured, it will be much easier to construct the  casing than if enameled ware is used. The holes can be easily  drilled and the parts fitted together closely. All seams and  surfaces around fittings can be soldered.    Nozzles are made of two stopcocks having a 1/8-in. hole. These are  connected to a 3/8-in. supply pipe. The nozzles should be set at  an angle of 20 deg. with the face of the disk. The nozzle or  stopcock will give better results if the discharge end is filed  parallel to the face of the disk when at an angle of 20 deg. There  should be a space of 1/16 in. between the nozzle and the blades to  allow for sufficient play, Fig. 3.    The bearings are made of 1/4-in. brass and bolted to the casing,  as shown, with 1/8-in. machine screws and nuts. Two nuts should be  placed on each screw. The pulley is made by sliding a piece of  steel pipe on the engine shaft and fastening it with machine  screws and nuts as shown in Fig. 6. If the shaft is square, lead  should be run into the segments.    The driven shaft should have a long bearing. The pulley on this  shaft is made of pieces of wood nailed together, and its  circumference cut out with a scroll saw. Flanges are screwed to  the pulley and fastened to the shaft as shown in Fig. 7.    The bearings are made of oak blocks lined with heavy tin or sheet  iron for the running surface. Motion is transmitted from the  engine to the large pulley by a thin but very good leather belt.        ** Homemade Telegraph Key [21]    A simple and easily constructed telegraph key may be made in the  following manner: Procure a piece of sheet brass, about 1/32 in.  thick, and cut out a strip 3-1/2 in. long by 3/4 in. wide. Bend as  shown in Fig. 1 and drill a hole for the knob in one end and a  hole for a screw in the other. Procure a small wood knob and  fasten it in place with a small screw. Cut a strip of the same  brass 2-3/4 in. long and 5/16 in. wide and bend as shown in Fig.  2. Drill two holes in the feet for screws to fasten it to the  base, and one hole in the top part for a machine screw, and solder  a small nut on the under side of the metal over the hole.    Mount both pieces on a base 4-1/4 by 2-3/4 by 1/4 in., as in Fig.  3, and where    [Illustration: Brass Key on a Wood Base]    the screw of the knob strikes the base when pressed down, put in a  screw or brass-headed tack for a contact. Fasten the parts down  with small brass wood-screws and solder the connections beneath  the base. Binding posts from an old battery cell are used on the  end of the base. The screw on top of the arch is used to adjust  the key for a long or short stroke.  --Contributed by S. V.

A barrel is sunk in the  ground in a shady place, allowing plenty of space about the  outside to fill in with gravel. A quantity of small stones and  sand is first put in wet. A box is placed in the hole over the top  of the barrel and filled in with clay or earth well tamped. The  porous condition of the gravel drains the surplus water after a  rain.    The end of the barrel is fitted with a light cover and a heavy  door hinged to the box. A small portion of damp sand is sprinkled  on the bottom of the barrel. The covers should be left open  occasionally to prevent mold and to remove any bad air that may  have collected from the contents.  --Contributed by F.
