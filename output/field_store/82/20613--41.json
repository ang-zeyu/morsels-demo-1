'In the performance of this work, he (Harlow) owed many  obligations to Fuseli for his critical remarks; for, when he first saw the  picture, chiefly in dead-colouring, he said, 'I do not disapprove of the  general arrangement of your work, and I see you will give it a powerful  effect of light and shadow; but you have here a composition of more than  twenty figures, or, I should rather say, parts of figures, because you  have not shown one leg or foot, which makes it very defective. Now, if you  do not know how to draw legs and feet, I will show you,' and taking up a  crayon, he drew two on the wainscot of the room. Harlow profited by these  remarks; and the next time we saw the picture, the whole arrangement in  the fore-ground was changed. Fuseli then said, 'so far you have done well:  but now you have not introduced a back figure, to throw the eye of the  spectator into the picture;' and then pointed out by what means he might  improve it in this particular. Accordingly, Harlow introduced the two boys  who are taking up the cushion.\"[2]    \"It has been stated that the majority of the actors in the scene sat for  their portraits in this picture. Mr. Kemble, however, refused, when asked  to do so by Mr. Welsh, strengthening his refusal with emphasis profane.  Harlow was not to be defeated, and he actually drew Mr. Kemble's portrait  in one of the stage-boxes of Covent Garden Theatre, while the great actor  was playing his part on the stage. The vexation of such a _ruse_ to a man  of Mr. Kemble's temperament, can better be imagined than described: how it  succeeded, must be left to the judgment of the reader. Egerton, Pope, and  Stephen Kemble, were successively painted for Henry VIII., the artist  retaining the latter. The head of Mr. Charles Kemble was likewise twice  painted: the first, which cost Mr. C. Kemble many sittings, was considered  by himself and others, very successful. The artist thought otherwise; and,  contrary to Mr. Kemble's wish and remonstrance, he one morning painted out  the approved head: in a day or two, however, entirely from recollection,  Harlow re-painted the portrait with increased fidelity. Mr. Cunningham, we  may here notice, has erroneously stated, that Harlow required but one  sitting of Mrs. Siddons. The fact is, the accomplished actress held her  up-lifted arm frequently till she could hold it raised no longer, and the  majestic limb was finished from another original.\"    The lights of _Love among the Roses_ are vivid and beautiful: the whole  composition will be recollected as of a charming character.    By the way, persons unpractised in the art of painting on glass, or in  transparent enamel, have but a slender idea of its difficulties.  Crown-glass is preferred for its greater purity. The artist has not only  to _paint_ the picture, but to fire it in a kiln, with the most  scrupulous attention to produce the requisite effects, and the  uncertainty of this branch of the art is frequently a sad trial of  patience. Hence, the firing or vitrification of the colours is of  paramount importance, and the art thus becomes a two-fold trial of  skill. Its cost is, however, only consistent with its brilliant effect.          [2] Quoted in Cunningham's Life of Harlow.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.    TEA.      What can we do with this pamphlet?--_British Relations with the Chinese  Empire--Comparative Statement of the English and American Trade with India  and Canton_. What a book for a tea-drinking old lady, or Dr. Johnson, of  tea-loving notoriety, with his thirteen cups to the dozen.    \"The writer has passed the last eleven years of his life in visiting every  quarter of the globe, and the colonial possessions of Great Britain, in  order to acquire an intimate knowledge of her commercial affairs, for  political purposes.\" The reader will, perhaps, say this pamphlet is purely  political, and what have you to do with it? But it is not so: there are  facts in these pages which interest every one and come home to every man's  mouth: the political purpose is to us like chaff; and these facts like  grains of wheat, so we will even pick a few. Meanwhile, the whole pamphlet  must be important to all, as to ourselves parts are interesting: it  represents the literature of the tea trade, and, best of all, the  profitable literature of _L.s.d._ It is written in a patriotic spirit;  witness this extract from the preface: \"To a commercial union of wealth,  and a co-operation of talent and patriotism, a small island in the Western  Atlantic is indebted for the acquisition of one of the most splendid  empires that ever was subjected to the dominion of man, and also for the  rise and progress of an extraordinary commerce with a people inhabiting a  distant hemisphere, and heretofore shut out from all intercourse with the  majority of the human race;--a commerce equal in extent to 10,000,000_l_.  annually, and involving property to the amount of ten times that sum.\"    Our _facts_ must stand isolated, since to weave them into an argument  would be altogether foreign to our purpose.    _East India Company_.--Although the East India Company can alone import  tea, they cannot choose their own time of sale; they are compelled to put  up the tea at an advance of _one penny_ (_they do at one farthing_) per  lb.; they are obliged to have twelve months' stock in hand; and while the  tea in America has _increased in price_ and diminished in consumption, the  _very reverse_ has taken place in England, as _official returns_ prove!    _China_ presents the very remarkable spectacle of _a civilization entirely  political_, whose principal aim has constantly been to draw closer the  bonds which unite the society it formed, and to merge, by its laws, the  interest of the individual in that of the public; an empire possessing an  active, skilful, and contented population of 155,000,000 souls, who are  spread over 1,372,450 square miles of the fairest and, probably, earliest  inhabited region of the globe--that maintains a _standing army_ of  1,182,000 men, and levies a revenue of only 11,649,912_l_. sterling--an  empire that has preserved the records of its dominion and the integrity of  its name from a period of three thousand years antecedent to our era,  while the most powerful monarchies of remote or modern ages have dwindled  into nothingness, or been borne towards the ocean of eternity, by the  swiftly destructive gulf of time,--an empire whose people have materially  contributed to advance the civilization of Europe and America, by the  discovery of the most useful arts and sciences, such as writing,[3]  astronomy, the mariner's compass, gunpowder, sugar, silk, porcelain, the  smelting and combination of metals,--and, in fine, enjoying within its own  territories all the necessaries and conveniencies, and most of the  luxuries of life; standing, as it proudly asserts, in no need of  intercourse with other countries,[4] which it is its studied policy to  prohibit,[5] openly and arrogantly proclaims its total independence of  every nation in the world!    _Origin of the Tea Trade of the East India Company_.--In 1668, the East  India Company ordered \"_one hundred pounds weight of goode tey_\" to be  sent home on speculation. A taste for the Chinese herb was created and  carefully fostered; the invoice was increased from year to year, until it  now amounts to 30,000,000 pounds weight (notwithstanding the excessive  duty of 100 per cent, and the onerous restrictions of the commutation act,  since 1784), yielding an annual revenue to government, on a _luxury of  life_, of about 3,300,000_l_. sterling, with scarcely any trouble or  expense in the collecting;--employing 35,000 tons of the finest  shipping,--requiring annually nearly 1,000,000_l_. sterling worth of  cotton, woollen, and iron manufactures, and affording employment to a  numerous class of society, for the wholesale and retail dealing in a leaf  collected on the mountains of a distant continent!    To enable them the better to prosecute this valuable commerce, the East  India Company sought and obtained permission to build a factory at Canton,  where their agents were permitted to reside six months in the year--a  favour specifically accorded as a matter of compassion to foreigners, who  are carefully debarred all intercourse with the interior of the country; a  dread being entertained that the introduction of Europeans to settle in  China, would lead (according also to ancient prophecy) to the total  subversion of the empire.    Other brunches of trade were subsequently added to that of tea. In 1773,  the East India Company made a small adventure of opium[6] from Bengal to  Canton; and the consumption of opium increased as rapidly among the  Chinese as tea did among the English, until it now yields (although a  contraband trade) 14,000,000 Spanish dollars annually,[7] and pays a  revenue to the Indian Government of 1,800,000_l_. sterling. Raw cotton  forms another extensive article of export to China; it is in general a  less profitable remittance than bills of exchange, but the exportation is  encouraged for the benefit of the Indian territories.    _Character of the Chinese_.--The Chinese are a haughty and independent  race of people, whose commercial policy it is to prohibit, as much as  possible, every species of manufactures[8] and bullion; and encourage the  importation of food, and raw produce; holding themselves aloof from  Europeans, and particularly jealous of Great Britain, on account of the  proximity of her Indian empire; exacting upwards of 1,000_l_. in fees and  port dues[9] on each foreign vessel that enters Canton, the only harbour  to which they are admitted,[10] imposing severe sea and inland customs and  regulations regarding woollen and other manufactures, entirely  interdicting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12552"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

No pump, no cistern, no drain of any kind, no dustman's cart, or any other  visible means of getting rid of the rubbish, which vanishes with such  celerity in London, that one has no time to think of its existence; but  which accumulated so rapidly at Cincinnati, that I sent for my landlord to  know in what manner refuse of all kinds was to be disposed of.    \"Your Help will just have to fix them all into the middle of the street,  but you must mind, old woman, that it is the middle. I expect you don't  know as we have got a law what forbids throwing such things at the sides  of the streets; they must just all be cast right into the middle, and the  pigs soon takes them off.'\"    _American English_.    \"I very seldom during my whole stay in the country heard a sentence  elegantly turned, and correctly pronounced from the lips of an American.  There is always something either in the expression or the accent that jars  the feelings and shocks the taste.\"    _Mr. Bullock_.    \"About two miles below Cincinnati, on the Kentucky side of the river, Mr.  Bullock, the well known proprietor of the Egyptian Hall, has bought a  large estate, with a noble house upon it. He and his amiable wife were  devoting themselves to the embellishment of the house and grounds; and  certainly there is more taste and art lavished on one of their beautiful  saloons, than all Western America can show elsewhere. It is impossible to  help feeling that Mr. Bullock is rather out of his element in this remote  spot, and the gems of art he has brought with him, show as strangely there,  as would a bower of roses in Siberia, or a Cincinnati fashionable at  Almack's. The exquisite beauty of the spot, commanding one of the finest  reaches of the Ohio, the extensive gardens, and the large and handsome  mansion, have tempted Mr. Bullock to spend a large sum in the purchase of  this place, and if any one who has passed his life in London could endure  such a change, the active mind and sanguine spirit of Mr. Bullock might  enable him to do it; but his frank, and truly English hospitality, and his  enlightened and inquiring mind, seemed sadly wasted there. I have since  heard with pleasure that Mr. Bullock has parted with this beautiful, but  secluded mansion.    \"Mr. Bullock was showing to some gentlemen of the first standing, the very  _elite_ of Cincinnati, his beautiful collection of engravings, when one  among them exclaimed, 'Have you really done all these since you came here?  How hard you must have worked!'\"    _Cows_.    \"These animals are fed morning and evening at the door of the house, with  a good mess of Indian corn, boiled with water; while they eat, they are  milked, and when the operation is completed the milk-pail and the meal-tub  retreat into the dwelling, leaving the republican cow to walk away, to  take her pleasure on the hills, or in the gutters, as may suit her fancy  best. They generally return very regularly to give and take the morning  and evening meal; though it more than once happened to us, before we were  supplied by a regular milk cart, to have our jug sent home empty, with the  sad news that 'the cow was not come home, and it was too late to look for  her to breakfast now.' Once, I remember, the good woman told us that she  had overslept herself, and that the cow had come and gone again, 'not  liking, I expect, to hanker about by herself for nothing, poor thing.'\"    _Health of Cincinnati_.    \"A gentleman told us, that when a medical man intended settling in a new  situation, he always, if he knew his business, walked through the streets  at night, before he decided. If he saw the dismal twinkle of the  watch-light from many windows he might be sure that disease was busy, and  that the 'location' might suit him well.\"    _Marketing_.    \"It is the custom for the gentlemen to go to market at Cincinnati; the  smartest men in the place, and those of the 'highest standing' do not  scruple to leave their beds with the sun, six days in the week, and,  prepared with a mighty basket, to sally forth in search of meat, butter,  eggs, and vegetables. I have continually seen them returning, with their  weighty basket on one arm and an enormous ham depending from the other.\"    _Moving Houses_.    \"One of the sights to stare at in America is that of houses moving from  place to place. We were often amused by watching this exhibition of  mechanical skill in the streets. They make no difficulty of moving  dwellings from one part of the town to another. Those I saw travelling  were all of them frame-houses, that is, built wholly of wood, except the  chimneys; but it is said that brick buildings are sometimes treated in the  same manner. The largest dwelling that I saw in motion was one containing  two stories of four rooms each; forty oxen were yoked to it. The first few  yards brought down the two stacks of chimneys, but it afterwards went on  well. The great difficulties were the first getting it in motion and the  stopping exactly in the right place. This locomotive power was extremely  convenient at Cincinnati, as the constant improvements going on there made  it often desirable to change a wooden dwelling for one of brick; and  whenever this happened, we were sure to see the ex No. 100 of Main-street  or the ex No. 55 of Second-street creeping quietly out of town, to take  possession of a humble suburban station on the common above it.\"    _Social distinctions_.    \"My general appellation amongst my neighbours was 'the English old woman,'  but in mentioning each other they constantly employed the term 'lady;' and  they evidently had a pleasure in using it, for I repeatedly observed, that  in speaking of a neighbour, instead of saying Mrs. Such-a-one, they  described her as 'the lady over the way what takes in washing,' or as  'that there lady, out by the Gulley, what is making dip-candles.' Mr.  Trollope was as constantly called 'the old man,' while dray-men, butchers'  boys, and the labourers on the canal were invariably denominated 'them  gentlemen;' nay, we once saw one of the most gentlemanlike men in  Cincinnati introduce a fellow in dirty shirt sleeves, and all sorts of  detestable et cetera, to one of his friends, with this formula, 'D---- let  me introduce this gentleman to you.'\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE COSMOPOLITE.      SUPERSTITIONS, FABLES, &c. RELATIVE TO ANIMALS.    (_Concluded from page 213_.)    The oriental fable of the _Roc_ has its probable origin in the condor,  which is undoubtedly the largest and strongest bird of the vulture tribe  in existence, and extremely ravenous. Minerva's bird, the _Owl_, is well  known as one of ill omen; besides the superstitious idea that the  screech-owl foretells death by its cry, it was formerly believed to suck  the blood of children. The Mongol and Calmuc Tartars have held the _White  Owl_ sacred since the days of Genghis Khan, when a bird of this species  having settled on a bush in which that prince had hidden himself from his  enemies, those who pursued him past it, not believing that a bird would  perch on a bush wherein a man was concealed. The _Raven_ has ever been  considered by the vulgar as a bird of evil omen, the indicator of  misfortunes and death; and, indeed, the superstition is but consonant with  a bird of such funereal note and hue, and exhibiting such goule-like  propensities. The Swedes, however, regard it as sacred, and no one offers  to molest it. In the north of England, one _Magpie_ flying alone, is  deemed an ill omen; two together, a fortunate one; three forebode a  funeral, and four a wedding; or, when on a journey, to meet two magpies  portends a wedding; three, a successful journey; four, unexpected good  news; and five, that the person will soon be in company with the great. To  kill a magpie, indicates or brings down some terrible misfortune. The  _Sparrow Hawk_ was sacred with the Egyptians, and the symbol of Osiris.  The _Yellow Hammer_ is superstitiously considered an agent _diablerie_.  The _Wheat-Ear_ is, in the Highlands, a detested bird, and fancied one of  evil omen, on account of its frequenting old churchyards, where it nestles  amongst the stones, and finds plenty of insects for food. The _Woodcock_  is, we believe, the bird imagined to drop, in its proper season, from the  moon. It is a vulgar error, that the song of the _Nightingale_ is  melancholy, and that it only sings by night; but to hear the Cuckoo before  the Nightingale has been long deemed an unsuccessful omen in love: the  saliva of the cuckoo has been thought to preserve all it falls upon.      \"The _Robin_ and the _Wren_    Are God Almighty's cock and hen,\"    says the old distich, and whilst it is reckoned wicked to kill either of  these (not but that there is an ancient custom of \"hunting the wren\" still  kept up, we believe, in some parts of this country,) it is considered  unlucky to kill a _Swallow_, or _House-Martin_. The _King-fisher_ is the  Halcyon of the ancients, who imagined that during the process of  incubation by the female the sea remained unvexed by storms; hence  \"halcyon days.\" The feathers of this bird are employed by the Tartars for  many superstitious purposes; they consider them amulets of priceless value,  enabling them to inspire women with love. In more civilized countries it  was once believed, that if the body of a kingfisher were suspended by a  thread, some magnetic influence would turn its breast to the north: others  thought it a preserver of woollen cloths from moths.
