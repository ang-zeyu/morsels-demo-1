And that mighty-armed individual with long and  abundant hair floating about his neck, resembled an elephant in gait.  And shaking the very earth with his tread, he approached Virata and  stood in his court. And beholding the son of the great Indra, shining  with exquisite lustre and having the gait of a mighty elephant,--that  grinder of foes having his true form concealed in disguise, entering the  council-hall and advancing towards the monarch, the king addressed all  his courtiers, saying, 'Whence doth this person come? I have never heard  of him before.' And when the men present spoke of the newcomer as one  unknown to them, the king wonderingly said, 'Possessed of great  strength, thou art like unto a celestial, and young and of darkish hue,  thou resemblest the leader of a herd of elephants. Wearing  conch-bracelets overlaid with gold, a braid, and ear-rings, thou shinest  yet like one amongst those that riding on chariots wander about equipped  with mail and bow and arrows and decked with garlands and fine hair. I  am old and desirous of relinquishing my burden. Be thou like my son, or  rule thou like myself all the Matsyas. It seemeth to me that such a  person as thou can never be of the neuter sex.'    \"Arjuna said, 'I sing, dance, and play on instruments. I am proficient  in dance and skilled in song. O lord of men, assign me unto (the  princess) Uttara. I shall be dancing-master to the royal maiden. As to  how I have come by this form, what will it avail thee to hear the  account which will only augment my pain? Know me, O king of men, to be  Vrihannala, a son or daughter without father or mother.'    \"Virata said, 'O Vrihannala, I give thee what thou desirest. Instruct my  daughter, and those like her, in dancing. To me, however, this office  seemeth unworthy of thee. Thou deservest (the dominion of) the entire  earth girt round by the ocean.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"The king of the Matsyas then tested Vrihannala  in dancing, music, and other fine arts, and consulting with his various  ministers forthwith caused him to be examined by women. And learning  that this impotency was of a permanent nature, he sent him to the  maiden's apartments. And there the mighty Arjuna began giving lessons in  singing and instrumental music to the daughter of Virata, her friends,  and her waiting-maids, and soon won their good graces. And in this  manner the self-possessed Arjuna lived there in disguise, partaking of  pleasures in their company, and unknown to the people within or without  the palace.\"      SECTION XII    Vaisampayana said, \"After a while, another powerful son of Pandu was  seen making towards king Virata in haste. And as he advanced, he seemed  to everyone like solar orb emerged from the clouds. And he began to  observe the horses around. And seeing this, the king of the Matsyas said  to his followers, 'I wonder whence this man, possessed of the effulgence  of a celestial, cometh. He looks intently at my steeds. Verily, he must  be proficient in horse-lore. Let him be ushered into my presence  quickly. He is a warrior and looks like a god!' And that destroyer of  foes then went up to the king and accosted him, saying, 'Victory to  thee, O king, and blest be ye. As a trainer of horses, I have always  been highly esteemed by kings. I will be a clever keeper of thy horses.'    \"Virata said, 'I will give thee vehicles, wealth, and spacious quarters.  Thou shalt be the manager of my horses. But first tell me whence thou  comest, who thou art, and how also thou happenest to come here. Tell us  also all the arts thou art master of.' Nakula replied, 'O mower of  enemies, know that Yudhishthira is the eldest brother of the five sons  of Pandu. I was formerly employed by him to keep his horses. I am  acquainted with the temper of steeds, and know perfectly the art of  breaking them. I know also how to correct vicious horses, and all the  methods of treating their diseases. No animal in my hands becometh weak  or ill. Not to speak of horses, even mares in my hands will never be  found to be vicious. People called me Granthika by name and so did  Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu.'    \"Virata said, 'Whatever horses I have, I consign to thy care even from  today. And all the keepers of my horses and all my charioteers will from  today be subordinate to thee. If this suits thee, say what remuneration  is desired by thee. But, O thou that resemblest a celestial, the office  of equerry is not worthy of thee. For thou lookest like a king and I  esteem thee much. The appearance here hath pleased me as much as if  Yudhishthira himself were here. Oh, how does that blameless son of Pandu  dwell and divert himself in the forest, now destitute of servants as he  is.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"That youth, like unto a chief of the  _Gandharvas_, was treated thus respectfully by the delighted king  Virata. And he conducted himself there in such a manner as to make  himself dear and agreeable to all in the palace. And no one recognised  him while living under Virata's protection. And it was in this manner  then the sons of Pandu, the very sight of whom had never been fruitless,  continued to live in the country of the Matsyas. And true to their  pledge those lords of the earth bounded by her belt of seas passed their  days of _incognito_ with great composure notwithstanding their poignant  sufferings.\"      SECTION XIII    (_Samayapalana Parva_)    Janamejaya said, \"While living thus disguised in the city of the  Matsyas, what did those descendants of the Kuru race endued with great  prowess, do, O regenerate one!\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Hear, O king, what those descendants of Kuru did  while they dwelt thus in disguise in the city of the Matsyas,  worshipping the king thereof. By the grace of the sage Trinavindu and of  the high-souled lord of justice, the Pandavas continued to live  unrecognised by others in the city of Virata. O lord of men,  Yudhishthira, as courtier made himself agreeable to Virata and his sons  as also to all the Matsyas. An adept in the mysteries of dice, the son  of Pandu caused them to play at dice according to his pleasure and made  them sit together in the dice-hall like a row of birds bound in a  string. And that tiger among men, king Yudhishthira the Just, unknown to  the monarch, distributed among his brothers, in due proportion, the  wealth he won from Virata. And Bhimasena on his part, sold to  Yudhishthira for price, meat and viands of various kinds which he  obtained from the king. And Arjuna distributed among all his brothers  the proceeds of worn-out cloths which he earned in the inner apartments  of the palace. And Sahadeva, too, who was disguised as a cowherd gave  milk, curds and clarified butter to his brothers. And Nakula also shared  with his brothers the wealth the king gave him, satisfied with his  management of the horses. And Draupadi, herself in a pitiable condition,  looked after all those brothers and behaved in such a way as to remain  unrecognized. And thus ministering unto one another's wants, those  mighty warriors lived in the capital of Virata as hidden from view, as  if they were once more in their mother's womb. And those lords of men,  the sons of Pandu, apprehensive of danger from the son of Dhritarashtra,  continued to dwell there in concealment, watching over their wife  Draupadi. And after three months had passed away, in the fourth, the  grand festival in honour of the divine Brahma which was celebrated with  pomp in the country of the Matsyas, came off. And there came athletes  from all quarters by thousands, like hosts of celestials to the abode of  Brahma or of Siva to witness that festival. And they were endued with  huge bodies and great prowess, like the demons called _Kalakhanjas_. And  elated with their prowess and proud of their strength, they were highly  honoured by the king. And their shoulders and waists and necks were like  those of lions, and their bodies were very clean, and their hearts were  quite at ease. And they had many a time won success in the lists in the  presence of kings. And amongst them there was one who towered above the  rest and challenged them all to a combat. And there was none that dared  to approach him as he proudly stalked in the arena. And when all the  athletes stood sad and dispirited, the king of the Matsyas made him  fight with his cook. And urged by the king, Bhima made up his mind  reluctantly, for he could not openly disobey the royal behest. And that  tiger among men then having worshipped the king, entered the spacious  arena, pacing with the careless steps of a tiger. And the son of Kunti  then girded up his loins to the great delight of the spectators. And  Bhima then summoned to the combat that athlete known by the name of  Jimuta who was like unto the Asura Vritra whose prowess was widely  known. And both of them were possessed of great courage, and both were  endued with terrible prowess. And they were like a couple of infuriate  and huge-bodied elephants, each sixty years old. And those brave tigers  among men then cheerfully engaged in a wrestling combat, desirous of  vanquishing each other. And terrible was the encounter that took place  between them, like the clash of the thunderbolt against the stony  mountain-breast. And both of them were exceedingly powerful and  extremely delighted at each other's strength. And desirous of  vanquishing each other, each stood eager to take advantage of his  adversary's lapse. And both were greatly delighted and both looked like  infuriate elephants of prodigious size. And various were the modes of  attack and defence that they exhibited with their clenched fists.["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 04 (#6)"],[1," they clasped each other  passionately and wept for love.    Dian could not comprehend it at all; he said in Italian: \"But it  surely cannot be you; you look old.\" He thought he was speaking German  all the time, till he heard Albano answer in Italian. Both gave and  received only questions. Albano found the architect merely browner,  but there was the lightning of the eyes and every faculty in its old  glory. With three words he related to him the journey, and who the  company were. \"How does Rome strike you?\" asked Dian, pleasantly. \"As  life does,\" replied Albano, very seriously, \"it makes me too soft and  too hard.\" \"I recognize here absolutely nothing at all,\" he continued;  \"do those columns belong to the magnificent temple of Peace?\" \"No,\"  said Dian, \"to the temple of Concord; of the other there stands yonder  nothing but the vault.\" \"Where is Saturn's temple?\" asked Albano.  \"Buried in St. Adrian's church,\" said Dian, and added hastily: \"Close  by stand the ten columns of Antonine's temple; over beyond there the  baths of Titus; behind us the Palatine hill; and so on. Now tell  me--!\"    They walked up and down the Forum, between the arches of Titus and  Severus. Albano (being near the teacher who, in the days of childhood,  had so often conducted him hitherward) was yet full of the stream  which had swept over the world, and the all-covering water sunk but  slowly. He went on and said: \"Today, when he beheld the Obelisk, the  soft, tender brightness of the moon had seemed to him eminently  unbecoming for the giant city; he would rather have seen a sun blazing  on its broad banner; but now the moon was the proper funeral-torch  beside the dead Alexander, who, at a touch, collapses into a handful  of dust.\" \"The artist does not get far with feelings of this kind,\"  said Dian, \"he must look upon everlasting beauties on the right hand  and on the left.\" \"Where,\" Albano went on asking, \"is the old lake of  Curtius--the Rostrum--the pila Horatia--the temple of Vesta--of Venus,  and of all those solitary columns?\" \"And where is the marble Forum  itself?\" said Dian; \"it lies thirty span deep below our feet.\" \"Where  is the great, free people, the senate of kings, the voice of the  orators, the procession to the Capitol? Buried under the mountain of  potsherds! O Dian, how can a man who loses a father, a beloved, in  Rome shed a single tear or look round him with consternation, when he  comes out here before this battle-field of time and looks into the  charnel-house of the nations? Dian, one would wish here an iron heart,  for fate has an iron hand!\"    Dian, who nowhere stayed more reluctantly than upon such tragic cliffs  hanging over, as it were, into the sea of eternity, almost leaped off  from them with a joke; like the Greeks, he blended dances with  tragedy! \"Many a thing is preserved here, friend!\" said he; \"in  Adrian's church yonder they will still show you the bones of the three  men that walked in the fire.\" \"That is just the frightful play of  destiny,\" replied Albano, \"to occupy the heights of the mighty  ancients with monks shorn down into slaves.\"    \"The stream of time drives new wheels,\" said Dian \"yonder lies Raphael  twice buried.[5]\" * * * And so they climbed silently and speedily over  rubbish and torsos of columns, and neither gave heed to the mighty  emotion of the other.    Rome, like the Creation, is an entire wonder, which gradually  dismembers itself into new wonders, the Coliseum, the Pantheon, St.  Peter's church, Raphael, etc.    With the passage through the church of St. Peter, the knight began the  noble course through Immortality. The Princess let herself, by the tie  of Art, be bound to the circle of the men. As Albano was more smitten  with edifices than with any other work of man, so did he see from  afar, with holy heart, the long mountain-chain of Art, which again  bore upon itself hills, so did he stop before the plain, around which  the enormous colonnades run like Corsos, bearing a people of statues.  In the centre shoots up the Obelisk, and on its right and left an  eternal fountain, and from the lofty steps the proud Church of the  world, inwardly filled with churches, rearing upon itself a temple  toward Heaven, looks down upon the earth. But how wonderfully, as they  drew near, had its columns and its rocky wall mounted up and flown  away from the vision!    He entered the magic church, which gave the world blessings, curses,  kings and popes, with the consciousness, that, like the world-edifice,  it was continually enlarging and receding more and more the longer one  remained in it. They went up to two children of white marble who held  an incense-muscle-shell of yellow marble; the children grew by  nearness till they were giants. At length they stood at the main  altar and its hundred perpetual lamps. What a place! Above them the  heaven's arch of the dome, resting on four inner towers; around them  an over-arched city of four streets in which stood churches. The  temple became greatest by walking in it; and, when they passed round  one column, there stood a new one before them, and holy giants gazed  earnestly down.    Here was the youth's large heart, after so long a time, filled. \"In no  art,\" said he to his father, \"is the soul so mightily possessed with  the sublime as in architecture; in every other the giant stands within  and in the depths of the soul, but here he stands out of and close  before it.\" Dian, to whom all images were more clear than abstract  ideas, said he was perfectly right. Fraischdoerfer replied, \"The  sublime also here lies only in the brain, for the whole church stands,  after all, in something greater, namely, in Rome, and under the  heavens; in the presence of which latter we certainly should not feel  anything.\" He also complained that \"the place for the sublime in his  head was very much narrowed by the innumerable volutes and monuments  which the temple shut up therein at the same time with itself.\"  Gaspard, taking everything in a large sense, remarked, \"When the  sublime once really appears, it then, by its very nature, absorbs and  annihilates all little circumstantial ornaments.\" He adduced as  evidence the tower of the Minster,[6] and Nature itself, which is not  made smaller by its grasses and villages.    Among so many connoisseurs of art, the Princess enjoyed in silence.    The ascent of the dome Gaspard recommended to defer to a dry and  cloudless day, in order that they might behold the queen of the world,  Rome, upon and from the proper throne; he therefore proposed, very  zealously, the visiting of the Pantheon, because he was eager to let  this follow immediately after the impression of Saint Peter's church.  They went thither. How simply and grandly the hall opens! Eight  yellow columns sustain its brow, and majestically as the head of the  Homeric Jupiter its temple arches itself. It is the Rotunda or  Pantheon. \"O the pigmies,\" cried Albano, \"who would fain give us new  temples! Raise the old ones higher out of the rubbish, and then you  have built enough!\" [7] They stepped in. There rose round about them a  holy, simple, free world-structure, with its heaven-arches soaring and  striving upward, an Odeum of the tones of the Sphere-music, a world in  the world! And overhead[8] the eye-socket of the light and of the sky  gleamed down, and the distant rack of clouds seemed to touch the lofty  arch over which it shot along! And round about them stood nothing but  the temple-bearers, the columns! The temple of _all_ gods endured and  concealed the diminutive altars of the later ones.    Gaspard questioned Albano about his impressions. He said he preferred  the larger church of Saint Peter. The knight approved, and said that  youth, like nations, always more easily found and better appreciated  the sublime than the beautiful, and that the spirit of the young man  ripened from strong to beautiful, as the body of the same ripens from  the beautiful into the strong; however, he himself preferred the  Pantheon. \"How could the moderns,\" said the Counsellor of Arts,  Fraischdoerfer, \"build anything, except some little Bernini-like  turrets?\" \"That is why,\" said the offended Provincial Architect, Dian  (who despised the Counsellor of Arts, because he never made a good  figure except in the esthetic hall of judgment as critic, never in the  exhibition-hall as painter), \"we moderns are, without contradiction,  stronger in criticism; though in practice we are, collectively and  individually, blockheads.\" Bouverot remarked that the Corinthian  columns might be higher. The Counsellor of Arts said that after all he  knew nothing more like this fine hemisphere than a much smaller one,  which he had found in Herculaneum molded in ashes, of the bosom of a  fair fugitive. The knight laughed, and Albano turned away in disgust  and went to the Princess.    He asked her for her opinion about the two temples. \"Sophocles here,  Shakespeare there; but I comprehend and appreciate Sophocles more  easily,\" she replied, and looked with new eyes into his new  countenance. For the supernatural illumination through the zenith of  Heaven, not through a hazy horizon, transfigured, in her eyes, the  beautiful and excited countenance of the youth; and she took for  granted that the saintly halo of the dome must also exalt her form.  When he answered her: \"Very good! But in Shakespeare, Sophocles also  is contained, not, however, Shakespeare in Sophocles--and upon Peter's  Church stands Angelo's Rotunda!\", just then the lofty cloud, all at  once, as by the blow of a hand out of the ether, broke in two, and the  ravished Sun, like the eye of a Venus floating through her ancient  heavens--for she once stood even here--looked mildly in from the upper  deep; then a holy radiance filled the temple, and burned on the  porphyry of the pavement, and Albano looked around him in an ecstasy  of wonder and delight, and said with low voice: \"How transfigured at"]]]
