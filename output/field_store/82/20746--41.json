Do you want to? I pity the poor man!  So good . . . so correct. The lawyer assures me that he agrees to  everything and will not impose any obstacles. They tell me that he does  not come to Paris, that he lives in his factory. Our old home is closed.  There are times when I feel remorseful over the way I have treated him.\"    \"And I?\" queried Julio, withdrawing his hand.    \"You are right,\" she returned smiling. \"You are Life. It is cruel but  it is human. We have to live our lives without taking others into  consideration. It is necessary to be selfish in order to be happy.\"    The two remained silent. The remembrance of the husband had swept across  them like a glacial blast. Julio was the first to brighten up.    \"And you have not danced in all this time?\"    \"No, how could I? The very idea, a woman in divorce proceedings! . . .  I have not been to a single chic party since you went away. I wanted to  preserve a certain decorous mourning fiesta. How horrible it was! . . .  It needed you, the Master!\"    They had again clasped hands and were smiling. Memories of the previous  months were passing before their eyes, visions of their life from five  to seven in the afternoon, dancing in the hotels of the Champs Elysees  where the tango had been inexorably associated with a cup of tea.    She appeared to tear herself away from these recollections, impelled  by a tenacious obsession which had slipped from her mind in the first  moments of their meeting.    \"Do you know much about what's happening? Tell me all. People talk so  much. . . . Do you really believe that there will be war? Don't you  think that it will all end in some kind of settlement?\"    Desnoyers comforted her with his optimism. He did not believe in the  possibility of a war. That was ridiculous.    \"I say so, too! Ours is not the epoch of savages. I have known some  Germans, chic and well-educated persons who surely must think exactly as  we do. An old professor who comes to the house was explaining yesterday  to mama that wars are no longer possible in these progressive times. In  two months' time, there would scarcely be any men left, in three, the  world would find itself without money to continue the struggle. I do not  recall exactly how it was, but he explained it all very clearly, in a  manner most delightful to hear.\"    She reflected in silence, trying to co-ordinate her confused  recollections, but dismayed by the effort required, added on her own  account.    \"Just imagine what war would mean--how horrible! Society life paralyzed.  No more parties, nor clothes, nor theatres! Why, it is even possible  that they might not design any more fashions! All the women in mourning.  Can you imagine it? . . . And Paris deserted. . . . How beautiful it  seemed as I came to meet you this afternoon! . . . No, no, it cannot  be! Next month, you know, we go to Vichy. Mama needs the waters. Then to  Biarritz. After that, I shall go to a castle on the Loire. And besides  there are our affairs, my divorce, our marriage which may take place the  next year. . . . And is war to hinder and cut short all this! No, no,  it is not possible. My brother and others like him are foolish enough  to dream of danger from Germany. I am sure that my husband, too, who is  only interested in serious and bothersome matters, is among those  who believe that war is imminent and prepare to take part in it. What  nonsense! Tell me that it is all nonsense. I need to hear you say it.\"    Tranquilized by the affirmations of her lover, she then changed the  trend of the conversation. The possibility of their approaching marriage  brought to mind the object of the voyage which Desnoyers had just made.  There had not been time for them to write to each other during their  brief separation.    \"Did you succeed in getting the money? The joy of seeing you made me  forget all about such things. . . .\"    Adopting the air of a business expert, he replied that he had brought  back less than he expected, for he had found the country in the throes  of one of its periodical panics; but still he had managed to get  together about four hundred thousand francs. In his purse he had a check  for that amount. Later on, they would send him further remittances.  A ranchman in Argentina, a sort of relative, was looking after his  affairs. Marguerite appeared satisfied, and in spite of her frivolity,  adopted the air of a serious woman.    \"Money, money!\" she exclaimed sententiously. \"And yet there is no  happiness without it! With your four hundred thousand and what I have,  we shall be able to get along. . . . I told you that my husband wishes  to give me back my dowry. He has told my brother so. But the state of  his business, and the increased size of his factory do not permit him to  return it as quickly as he would like. I can't help but feel sorry for  the poor man . . . so honorable and so upright in every way. If he only  were not so commonplace! . . .\"    Again Marguerite seemed to regret these tardy spontaneous eulogies which  were chilling their interview. So again she changed the trend of her  chatter.    \"And your family? Have you seen them?\" . . .    Desnoyers had been to his father's home before starting for the Chapelle  Expiatoire. A stealthy entrance into the great house on the avenue  Victor Hugo, and then up to the first floor like a tradesman. Then he  had slipt into the kitchen like a soldier sweetheart of the maids.  His mother had come there to embrace him, poor Dona Luisa, weeping and  kissing him frantically as though she had feared to lose him forever.  Close behind her mother had come Luisita, nicknamed Chichi, who always  surveyed him with sympathetic curiosity as if she wished to know better  a brother so bad and adorable who had led decent women from the paths  of virtue, and committed all kinds of follies. Then Desnoyers had been  greatly surprised to see entering the kitchen with the air of a tragedy  queen, a noble mother of the drama, his Aunt Elena, the one who had  married a German and was living in Berlin surrounded with innumerable  children.    \"She has been in Paris a month. She is going to make a little visit to  our castle. And it appears that her eldest son--my cousin, 'The Sage,'  whom I have not seen for years--is also coming here.\"    The home interview had several times been interrupted by fear. \"Your  father is at home, be careful,\" his mother had said to him each time  that he had spoken above a whisper. And his Aunt Elena had stationed  herself at the door with a dramatic air, like a stage heroine resolved  to plunge a dagger into the tyrant who should dare to cross the  threshold. The entire family was accustomed to submit to the rigid  authority of Don Marcelo Desnoyers. \"Oh, that old man!\" exclaimed Julio,  referring to his father. \"He may live many years yet, but how he weighs  upon us all!\"    His mother, who had never wearied of looking at him, finally had to  bring the interview to an end, frightened by certain approaching sounds.  \"Go, he might surprise us, and he would be furious.\" So Julio had fled  the paternal home, caressed by the tears of the two ladies and the  admiring glances of Chichi, by turns ashamed and proud of a brother who  had caused such enthusiasm and scandal among her friends.    Marguerite also spoke of Senor Desnoyers. A terrible tyrant of the old  school with whom they could never come to an understanding.    The two remained silent, looking fixedly at each other. Now that they  had said the things of greatest urgency, present interests became more  absorbing. More immediate things, unspoken, seemed to well up in their  timid and vacillating eyes, before escaping in the form of words.  They did not dare to talk like lovers here. Every minute the cloud of  witnesses seemed increasing around them. The woman with the dogs and the  red wig was passing with greater frequency, shortening her turns through  the square in order to greet them with a smile of complicity. The  reader of the daily paper was now exchanging views with a friend on a  neighboring bench regarding the possibilities of war. The garden  had become a thoroughfare. The modistes upon going out from their  establishments, and the ladies returning from shopping, were crossing  through the square in order to shorten their walk. The little avenue was  a popular short-cut. All the pedestrians were casting curious glances at  the elegant lady and her companion seated in the shadow of the shrubbery  with the timid yet would-be natural look of those who desire to hide  themselves, yet at the same time feign a casual air.    \"How exasperating!\" sighed Marguerite. \"They are going to find us out!\"    A girl looked at her so searchingly that she thought she recognized in  her an employee of a celebrated modiste. Besides, some of her personal  friends who had met her in the crowded shops but an hour ago might be  returning home by way of the garden.    \"Let us go,\" she said rising hurriedly. \"If they should spy us here  together, just think what they might say! . . . and just when they are  becoming a little forgetful!\"    Desnoyers protested crossly. Go away? . . . Paris had become a shrunken  place for them nowadays because Marguerite refused to go to a single  place where there was a possibility of their being surprised. In another  square, in a restaurant, wherever they might go--they would run the same  risk of being recognized. She would only consider meetings in public  places, and yet at the same time, dreaded the curiosity of the people.  If Marguerite would like to go to his studio of such sweet  memories! . . .    \"To your home? No! no indeed!\" she replied emphatically \"I cannot forget  the last time I was there.\"    But Julio insisted, foreseeing a break in that firm negative. Where  could they be more comfortable? Besides, weren't they going to marry as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14866"],[0,"Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#6)"],[1," the  fur-bearing Yukon is well worth considering. It consists in opening  and closing the country by alternate sections, like crops and fallow  land in farming. The Indians have followed this method for  generations, dividing the family hunting grounds into three parts,  hunting each in rotation, and always leaving enough to breed back the  numbers. But the pressure of the grab-all policy from outside may  become irresistible.    The one great point to remember is that there is no time to lose in  beginning conservation by protecting every species in at least two  separate localities.    A word as to the management and wardens. Two zoologists and twenty men  afloat, and the same number ashore, could probably do the whole work,  in connection with local wardens. This may seem utterly ridiculous as  a police force to patrol ten Englands and three thousand miles of sea.  But look at what the Royal North West Mounted Police have done over  vast areas with a handful of men, and what has been effected in Maine,  New Brunswick and Ontario. Once the public understands the question,  and the governments mean business, the way of the transgressor will be  so hard--between the wardens, zoologists and all the preventive  machinery of modern administration--that it will no longer pay him to  walk in it. Special precautions must be taken against that vilest of  all inventions of diabolical ingenuity--the Maxim \"silencer.\" No  argument is needed to prove that silent firearms could not suit crime  better if they were made expressly for it. The mere possession of any  kind of \"silencer\" should constitute a most serious criminal offence.  The right kind of warden will be forthcoming when he is really wanted  and is properly backed up. I need not describe the wrong kind. We all  know him, only too well.      BENEFITS    I am afraid I have already exceeded my allotted time. But, with your  kind indulgence, Sir, I should like, in conclusion, simply to  enumerate a few of the benefits certain to follow the introduction and  enforcement of law and the establishment of sanctuaries.    First, it cannot be denied that the constant breaking of the present  law makes for bad citizenship, and that the observance of law will  make for good. Next, though it is often said that what Canada needs  most is development and not conservation, I think no one will deny  that conservation is the best and most certainly productive form of  development in the case before us. Then, I think we have here a really  unique opportunity of effecting a reform that will unite and not  divide all the legitimate interests concerned. What could appear to  have less in common than electricity and sanctuaries? Yet electricity  in Labrador requires water-power, which requires a steady flow, which  requires a head-water forest, which, in its turn, is admirably fit to  shelter wild life. Except for those who would selfishly and  shortsightedly take all this wealth of wild life out of the world  altogether, in one grasping generation, there is nobody who will not  be the better for the change. I have talked with interested parties of  every different kind, and always found them agree that conservation is  the only thing to do--provided, as they invariably add, that it is  done \"straight\" and \"the same for all.\"    Fourthly, a word as to sport. I have invoked the public conscience  against wanton destruction and its inevitable accompaniment of  cruelty. I know, further, that man is generally cruel and a bully  towards other animals. And, as an extreme evolutionist, I believe all  animals are alike in kind, however much they may differ in degree. But  I don't think clean sport cruel. It does not add to the sum total of  cruelty under present conditions. Wild animals shun pain and death as  we do. But under Nature they never die what we call natural deaths.  They starve or get killed. Moreover, town-bred humanitarians feel pain  and death more than the simpler races of men, who, in their turn, feel  it more than lower animals. A wild animal that has just escaped death  will resume its occupation as if nothing had happened. The sportsman's  clean kill is only an incident in the day's work, not anxiously  apprehended like an operation or a battle. But pain and death are very  real, all the same. So death should be inflicted as quickly as  possible, even at the risk of losing the rest of one's bag. And, even  beyond the reach of any laws, no animal should ever be killed in sport  when its own death might entail the lingering death of its young. A  sportsman who observes these rules instinctively, and who never kills  what he cannot get and use, is not a cruel man. He certainly is a  beast of prey. But so is the most delicate invalid woman when drinking  a cup of beef tea. Sport has its use in the development of health and  skill and courage. Its practice is one of life's eternal compromises.  And the best thing we can do for it now is to make it clean. We have  far too much of the other kind. The essential difference has never  been more shrewdly put than in the caustic epigram, that there is the  same difference between a sportsman and a \"sport\" as there is between  a gentleman and a \"gent.\" I believe that the enforcement of laws and  the establishment of sanctuaries will raise our sport to a higher  plane, reduce the suffering now inflicted when killing for business,  and help in every way towards the conversion of the human into the  humane. Besides, paradoxical as it may seem to some good people, the  true sportsman has always proved to be one of the very best conservers  of all wild life worth keeping. So there is a distinctly desirable  benefit to be expected in this direction, as in every other.    Finally, I return to my zoophilists, a vast but formless class of  people, both in and outside of the other classes mentioned, and one  which includes every man, woman and child with any fondness for wild  life, from zoologists to tourists. There are higher considerations,  never to be forgotten. But let me first press the point that there's  money in the zoophilists--plenty of it. A gentleman, in whom you, Sir,  and your whole Commission have the greatest confidence, and who was  not particularly inexpert at the subject, made an under-valuation to  the extent of no less than 75 per cent., when trying to estimate the  amount of money made by the transportation companies directly out of  travel to \"Nature\" places for sport, study, scenery and other kinds of  outing. There is money in it now, millions of it; and there is going  to be much more money in it later on. Civilized town-dwelling men,  women and children are turning more and more to wild Nature for a  holiday. And their interest in Nature is widening and deepening in  proportion. I do not say this as a rhetorical flourish. I have taken  particular pains to find out the actual growth of this interest, which  is shown in ways as comprehensive as educational curricula, picture  books for children, all sorts of \"Animal\" works, \"zoos\", museums,  lectures, periodicals and advertisements; and I find all facts  pointing the same way. The president of one of the greatest  publishers' associations in the world told me, and without being  asked, that the most marked and the steadiest development in the trade  was in \"Nature\" books of every kind. And this reminds me of the  countless readers who rarely hear the call of the wild themselves,  except through word and picture, but who would bitterly and  justifiably resent the silencing of that call in the very places where  it ought to be heard at its best.    Now, where can the call of wild Nature be heard to greater advantage  than in Labrador, which is a land made on purpose to be the home of  fur, fin and feather? And it is accessible, in the best of all  possible ways--by sea. It is about equidistant from central Canada,  England and the States--a wilderness park for all of them. Means of  communication are multiplying fast. Even now, it would be possible, in  a good steamer, to take a month's holiday from London to Labrador,  spending twenty days on the coast and only ten at sea. I think we may  be quite sure of such travel in the near future; that is, of course,  if the travellers have a land of life, not death, to come to. And an  excellent thing about it is that Labrador cannot be overrun and spoilt  like what our American friends so aptly call a \"pocket wilderness\".  Ten wild Englands, properly conserved, cannot be brought into the  catalogue of common things quite so easily as all that! Besides,  Labrador enjoys a double advantage in being essentially a seaboard  country. The visitor has the advantage of being able to see a great  deal of it--and the finest parts, too--without getting out of touch  with his moveable base afloat. And the country itself has the  corresponding advantage of being less liable to be turned into a  commonplace summer resort by the whole monotonizing apparatus of  hotels and boarding houses and conventional \"sights\".    And now, Sir, I venture once more to mention the higher interests, and  actually to specify one of them, although I have been repeatedly  warned by outsiders that no public men would ever listen to anything  which could not be expressed in \"easy terms of dollars and cents!\" And  I do so in full confidence that no appeal to the intellectual life  would fall on deaf ears among the members of a Commission which was  founded to lead rather than follow the best thought of our time. I  need not remind you that from the topmost heights of Evolution you can  see whole realms of Nature infinitely surpassing all those of  business, sport and tourist recreation, and that the theory of  Evolution itself is the crowned brain of the entire Animal Kingdom.  But I doubt whether, as yet, we fully realize that Labrador is  absolutely unique in being the only stage on which the prologue and  living pageant of Evolution can be seen together from a "]]]
