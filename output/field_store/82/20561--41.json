He obeyed, and having formed a litter for the lady, she was borne on the  shoulders of four stout Turks. When they arrived at the postern gate,  Sophronia told the captain that he, with his men, must first enter the  castle, and then kill the sentinels and wardens, after which he would be  enabled to give admittance to all his friends. The Turks strictly obeyed  the lady, who before the affair began hastened with Annis to her  apartment in order to await the issue of her plot. The Turks entered the  castle by hundreds, killing all they met, and were soon masters of the  place. Meanwhile, Sophronia and Annis, both dreadfully agitated, heard  from their chamber the dying groans of the poor Christians. Sometimes  the clashing of swords was distinguished, as if a number of persons were  engaged in combat; sometimes the loud lamentations of women intervened;  and sometimes the voices of the conquerors were alone heard in  exultation. At length the door of Sophronia's room burst open, and  Abdurachman rushed in to seize her, while Annis, nearly dead with  terror, calmly submitted to the grasp of a common soldier who  accompanied the captain.    The dreadful scene was acted and over; the Turks were possessors of the  famed castle of Abydos, and Sophronia's father, the governor, was  hanged. Alas! deluded Sophronia! The faithless Abdurachman, whom she  supposed to have seen in a dream, regarded her not; even lots were cast  for her, and she fell to the share of one whom she did not know. The  beautiful Sophronia took poison and expired.

(_Concluded from page 46._)      There is a point at which the inconvenience of superfluities so far  exceeds their utility, that luxury becomes converted into a perfect  bore. What, for instance, but an annoyance, would be the most splendid  feast, to a man whose stomach is already overladen with food? Human  ingenuity may effect much; and the Romans, by means of emetics, met this  emergency with considerable skill; but on a more enlarged experience of  general history, it must be conceded, that it is quite impossible to add  one more superfluous meal to those already established by general usage.  So also in matters of dress, ladies' hats must not be larger than the  actual doorways of the country will admit--not at least until time is  allowed for a corresponding increase in our architectural proportions.  With respect to personal ornaments also, ear-rings must not be so  weighty as to tear the lobes of the ears; nor should a bracelet prevent,  by its size, the motions of the arm. \"Barbaric pomp and gold\" is a fine  thing; but a medallion, as heavy and as cumbrous as a shield, appended  to a lady's bosom, would be any thing but a luxury. So, in the other  extreme, a watch should not be so small as to render the dial-plate  illegible; nor should a shoe be so tight as to lame its wearer for life.  Beauty, it has been said, should learn to suffer; and there are, I am  aware, resources in vanity, that will reconcile man, and woman too, to  martyrdom; but these resources should not be exhausted wantonly; and in  pleasure, as in economy, there is no benefit in lighting the candle at  both ends. The true philosopher extracts the greatest good out of every  thing; and fools only, as Horace has it, run into one vice in trying to  avoid another. Let not the reader, from these remarks, suppose that  their author is a morose censurer of the times; or that the least sneer  is intended against that idol of all orthodoxy \"things as they are.\" As  a general proposition, nothing can be more true, than that whatever is  established, even in the world of fashion, is, for the time being,  wisest, discreetest, best; and, woe betide the man that flies too  directly in its face.    There is, however, one point upon which I own myself a little sore; and  in which, I do think, superfluities are carried to a somewhat vicious  excess. The point to which I allude, and I beg the patience of the  reader, is the vast increase of superfluities, which of late years have  become primary necessaries in the appointment of a well-furnished house.  Here, indeed, is a revolution; a revolution more formidable than the  French and the American emancipation put together. We all remember the  time when one tea-table, two or three card-tables, a pier glass, a small  detachment of chairs, with two armed corporals to command them, on  either side the fire-place, with a square piece of carpet in the centre  of the floor, made a very decent display in the drawing, or (as it was  then preposterously called) the dining-room. As yet, rugs for the hearth  were not; and twice a day did Betty go upon her knees to scour the  marble and uncovered slab. In the bedrooms of those days, a narrow slip  of carpet round the bed was the maximum of woollen integument allowed  for protecting the feet of the midnight wanderer from his couch; and, in  the staircases of the fairest mansions, a like slip meandered down the  centre of the flight of steps. At that time, curtains rose and fell in a  line parallel to the horizon, after the simple plan of the green  siparium of our theatres; and, being strictly confined to the windows,  they never dreamed of displaying themselves in front of a door. No  golden serpents then twisted their voluminous folds across the entire  breadth of the room; nor did richly-carved cods' heads and shoulders,  under the denomination of dolphins, or glittering spread eagles, with a  brass ring in their mouths, support fenestral draperies, which rival the  display of a Waterloo-house calico-vender. Thus far, I admit, the change  is an improvement. Nay, I could away with ladders to go to bed withal,  though many a time and oft they have broken my shins. I would not either  object to sofas and ottomans, in any reasonable proportion; but protest  I must, and in the strongest terms too, against such a multiplication  and variety of easy chairs, as effectually exclude the possibility of  easy sitting; and against the overweening increase of spider-tables,  that interferes with rectilinear progression. An harp mounted on a  sounding-board, which is a stumbling-block to the feet of the  short-sighted, is, I concede, an absolute necessity; and a piano-forte,  like a coffin, should occupy the centre even of the smallest given  drawing-room--\"the court awards it, and the law doth give it,\"--but why  multiply footstools, till there is no taking a single step in safety? An  Indian cabinet also, or a buhl armoire, are, either, or both of them,  very fit and becoming; but it cannot be right to make a broker's shop of  your best apartment. An ink-stand, as large as a show twelfth-cake, is  just and lawful; ditto, an ornamental escrutoire; and a _necessaire_ for  the work-table is, if there be meaning in language, perfectly necessary.  These, with an adequate contingent of musical snuff-boxes, _or molu_  clocks, China figures, alabaster vases and flower-pots, together with a  discreet superfluity of cut-paper nondescripts, albums, screens, toys,  prints, caricatures, duodecimo classics, new novels and souvenirs, to  cut a dash, and litter the tables, must be allowed to the taste and  refinement of the times. But surely some space should be left for  depositing a coffee-cup, or laying down a useful volume, when the hand  may require to be relieved from its weight, or when it is proper to take  a pinch of snuff, or agreeable to wipe one's forehead. Josses, beakers,  and Sevres' vases have unquestionably the _entree_ into a genteel  apartment; but they are not entitled to a monopoly of the _locale_; nor  are Roman antiquities, or statues even by Canova, justifiable in  usurping the elbow-room of living men and women. Most unfortunately for  myself, I have a very small house, and a wife of the most enlarged  taste; and the disproportion between these blessings is so great, that I  cannot move without the risk of a heavy pecuniary loss by breakage, and  a heavier personal affliction in perpetual imputations of awkwardness.  Then, again, it is no easy matter to put on a smiling and indifferent  countenance, whenever a friend, accustomed to some latitude of motion,  runs, as is often the case, his devastating chair against a high-priced  work of art, or overturns a table laden with an \"infinite thing\" in  costly _bijouterie_. I have long made it a rule to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#6)"],[1," are no records. There are no acceptable figures regarding the  respective numbers of whites and blacks. Nor is there any record of the  population in 1895, the year of the war for independence. From the definite  tabulation, under American auspices, in 1899, showing 1,576,797, it has  been estimated that the number in 1895, was a little less than 1,800,000,  the difference being represented by the disasters of the war, by the result  of reconcentration, and by departures during the disturbance. The general  result seems to be that the population was practically quadrupled. A  somewhat rough approximation would show the blacks as multiplied by three,  to an 1899 total of 505,000, with the whites multiplied by four, to a total  of 1,067,000. Nor are there figures of trade that afford any proper clue  to the growth of industry and commerce. There are records of imports  and exports from about 1850 onward, but before that time the matter of  contraband trade introduces an element of uncertainty. An American official  pamphlet on Cuban trade carries the statement, \"the ascertainment of full  and exact details of the commerce of Cuba prior to the close of Spanish  dominion in the island is an impossibility. The Spanish authorities, as  a rule, published no complete returns of Cuban trade, either foreign or  domestic. Except with regard to Spain and the United States, most of the  existing commercial statistics of Cuba, prior to 1899, are fragmentary  and merely approximative. Spain and the United States have always kept a  separate and distinct trade account with Cuba; but the United Kingdom,  France, Germany, and other European countries excepting Spain, formerly  merged their statistics of trade with Cuba in one general item embracing  Cuba and Porto Rico, under the heading of \"Spanish West Indies.\" Since  1899, however, all the Powers have kept separate accounts with Cuba,  and the statistics of the Cuban Republic have been reasonably full and  accurate.\"    [Illustration: IRON GRILLE GATEWAY _El Vedado, Suburb of Havana_]    Cuba's recorded imports in 1894 show a total value of $90,800,000, and  exports show a value of $102,000,000. Writing about the year 1825, Humboldt  says: \"It is more than probable that the imports of the whole island, licit  and contraband, estimated at the actual value of the goods and the slaves,  amount, at the present time, to fifteen or sixteen millions of dollars, of  which barely three or four millions are re-exported.\" The same authority  gives the probable exports of that time as about $12,500,000. The trade at  the beginning of the century must have been far below this. The official  figures for 1851 show total imports amounting to $34,000,000, and exports  to $33,000,000, but the accuracy of the figures is open to question. The  more important fact is that of a very large gain in population and in  production. The coffee industry, that assumed important proportions during  a part of the first half of the century, gradually declined for the reason  that sugar became a much more profitable crop. Now, Cuba imports most of  its coffee from Porto Rico. Because of its convenience as a contraband  article, there are no reliable figures of the tobacco output. Prior to  1817, the commodity was, for much of the time, a crown monopoly and, for  the remainder of the time, a monopoly concession to private companies. In  that year, cultivation and trade became free, subject to a tax on each  planter of one-twentieth of his production.    As we shall see, in another chapter, Cuba at last wearied of Spanish  exactions and revolted as did the United States, weary of British rule and  British exactions and restrictions, more than a hundred years earlier.          III    _THE COUNTRY_      Description of the physical features of a country seldom makes highly  entertaining reading, but it seems a necessary part of a book of this kind.  Some readers may find interest if not entertainment in such a review. The  total area of the island, including a thousand or more adjacent islands,  islets, and keys, is given as 44,164 square miles, a little less than the  area of Pennsylvania and a little more than that of Ohio or Tennessee.  Illustration of its shape by some familiar object is difficult, although  various comparisons have been attempted. Some old Spanish geographers gave  the island the name of _La Lengua de Pajaro_, \"the bird's tongue.\" Mr. M.M.  Ballou likened it to \"the blade of a Turkish scimitar slightly curved back,  or approaching the form of a long, narrow, crescent.\" Mr. Robert T. Hill  holds that it \"resembles a great hammer-headed shark, the head of which  forms the straight, south coast of the east end of the island, from which  the sinuous body extends westward. This analogy is made still more striking  by two long, finlike strings of keys, or islets, which extend backward  along the opposite coasts, parallel to the main body of the island.\" But  all such comparisons call for a lively imagination. It might be likened to  the curving handles of a plow attached to a share, or to any one of a dozen  things that it does not at all clearly resemble. Regarding the Oriente  coast, from Cape Cruz to Cape Maisi, as a base, from that springs a long  and comparatively slender arm that runs northwesterly for five hundred  miles to the vicinity of Havana. There, the arm, somewhat narrowed, turns  downward in a generally southwestern direction for about two hundred miles.  The total length of the island, from Cape Maisi on the east to Cape San  Antonio on the west, is about seven hundred and thirty miles. Its width  varies from a maximum, in Oriente Province, of about one hundred and sixty  miles, to a minimum, in Havana Province, of about twenty-two miles. It has  a general coast line of about twenty-two hundred miles, or, following all  its sinuosities, of about seven thousand miles. Its north coast is, for  much of its length, steep and rocky. Throughout the greater part of the  middle provinces, there is a border of coral reefs and small islands. At  the western end, the north coast is low, rising gradually to the eastward.  At the eastern end, the northern coast is abrupt and rugged, rising in a  series of hills to the elevations in the interior. Westward from Cape Maisi  to Cape Cruz, on the south coast, and immediately along the shore line,  runs a mountain range. From here westward, broken by an occasional hill or  bluff, the coast is low and marshy.    Probably the best description of the topography and the orography of the  island yet presented is that given by Mr. Robert T. Hill, of the United  States Geological Survey. In his book on Cuba and other islands of the West  Indies, Mr. Hill says:    \"As regards diversity of relief, Cuba's eastern end is mountainous, with  summits standing high above the adjacent sea; its middle portion is wide,  consisting of gently sloping plains, well-drained, high above the sea, and  broken here and there by low, forest-clad hills; and its western third is  a picturesque region of mountains, with fertile slopes and valleys, of  different structure and less altitude than those of the east. Over the  whole is a mantle of tender vegetation, rich in every hue that a flora of  more than three thousand species can give, and kept green by mists and  gentle rains. Indenting the rock-bound coasts are a hundred pouch-shaped  harbors such as are but rarely found in the other islands and shores of the  American Mediterranean.    \"But, at the outset the reader should dispossess his mind of any  preconceived idea that the island of Cuba is in any sense a physical unit.  On the contrary, it presents a diversity of topographic, climatic, and  cultural features, which, as distributed, divide the island into at least  three distinct natural provinces, for convenience termed the eastern,  central, and western regions. The distinct types of relief include regions  of high mountains, low hills, dissected plateaus, intermontane valleys, and  coastal swamps. With the exception of a strip of the south-central coast,  the island, as a whole, stands well above the sea, is thoroughly drained,  and presents a rugged aspect when viewed from the sea. About one-fourth of  the total area is mountainous, three-fifths are rolling plain, valleys, and  gentle arable slopes, and the remainder is swampy.    \"The island border on the north presents a low cliff topography, with a  horizontal sky-line from Matanzas westward, gradually decreasing from five  hundred feet at Matanzas to one hundred feet on the west. The coast of the  east end is abrupt and rugged, presenting on both the north and south sides  a series of remarkable terraces, rising in stair-like arrangement to six  hundred feet or more, representing successive pauses or stages in the  elevation of the island above the sea, and constituting most striking  scenic features. About one-half the Cuban coast is bordered by keys, which  are largely old reef rock, the creations of the same coral-builders that  may now be seen through the transparent waters still at work on the modern  shallows, decking the rocks and sands with their graceful and many colored  tufts of animal foliage.\"    Mr. Hill summarizes the general appearance of the island, thus: \"Santiago  de Cuba (now called Oriente) is predominantly a mountainous region of high  relief, especially along the coasts, with many interior valleys. Puerto  Principe (now Camaguey) and Santa Clara are broken regions of low mountain  relief, diversified by extensive valleys. Matanzas and Havana are vast  stretches of level cultivated plain, with only a few hills of relief. Pinar  del Rio is centrally mountainous, with fertile coastward slopes.\" The  notable elevations of the island are the Cordilleras de los Organos, or  Organ Mountains, in Pinar del Rio, of which an eastward extension appears  in the Tetas de Managua, the Arcas de Canasi, the Escalera de Jaruco,  the Pan de Matanzas, and"]]]
