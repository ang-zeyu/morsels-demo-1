Jim hauled on the  rope while Whang screamed and fought with his forefeet high in the air.  Then Jim, with a powerful jerk, pulled Whang down and threw him, while  Lem, seizing the bridle, hauled him over on his side and sat upon his  head. Whereupon Jim slipped the loop off one front hoof and pulled the  other leg back across one of the hind ones, where both were secured by a  quick hitch. Then the lasso was wound and looped around front and back  hoofs together. When this had been done the mustang was rolled over on  his other side, his free front hoof lassoed and pulled back to the hind  one, where both were secured, as had been the others. This rendered the  mustang powerless, and the shoeing proceeded.    Columbine hated to sit by and watch it, but she always stuck to her  post, when opportunity afforded, because she knew the cowboys would not  be brutal while she was there.    \"Wal, he'll step high to-morrer,\" said Lem, as he got up from his seat  on the head of Whang.    \"Ahuh! An', like a mule, he'll be my friend fer twenty years jest to get  a chance to kick me.\" replied Jim.    For Columbine, the most interesting moment of this incident was when the  mustang raised his head to look at his legs, in order to see what had  been done to them. There was something almost human in that look. It  expressed intelligence and fear and fury.    The cowboys released his legs and let him get up. Whang stamped his  iron-shod hoofs.    \"It was a mean trick, Whang,\" said Columbine. \"If I owned you that'd  never be done to you.\"    \"I reckon you can have him fer the askin',\" said Jim, as he threw on the  saddle. \"Nobody but me can ride him. Do you want to try?\"    \"Not in these clothes,\" replied Columbine, laughing.    \"Wal, Miss Collie, you're shore dressed up fine to-day, fer some reason  or other,\" said Lem, shaking his head, while he gathered up the tools  from the ground.    \"Ahuh! An' here comes the reason,\" exclaimed Jim, in low, hoarse  whisper.    Columbine heard the whisper and at the same instant a sharp footfall on  the gravel road. She quickly turned, almost losing her balance. And she  recognized Jack Belllounds. The boy Buster Jack she remembered so well  was approaching, now a young man, taller, heavier, older, with paler  face and bolder look. Columbine had feared this meeting, had prepared  herself for it. But all she felt when it came was annoyance at the fact  that he had caught her sitting on top of the corral fence, with little  regard for dignity. It did not occur to her to jump down. She merely sat  straight, smoothed down her skirt, and waited.    Jim led the mustang out of the corral and Lem followed. It looked as if  they wanted to avoid the young man, but he prevented that.    \"Howdy, boys! I'm Jack Belllounds,\" he said, rather loftily. But his  manner was nonchalant. He did not offer to shake hands.    Jim mumbled something, and Lem said, \"Hod do.\"    \"That's an ornery--looking bronc,\" went on Belllounds, and he reached  with careless hand for the mustang. Whang jerked so hard that he pulled  Jim half over.    \"Wal, he ain't a bronc, but I reckon he's all the rest.\" drawled Jim.    Both cowboys seemed slow, careless. They were neither indifferent nor  responsive. Columbine saw their keen, steady glances go over Belllounds.  Then she took a second and less hasty look at him. He wore high-heeled,  fancy-topped boots, tight-fitting trousers of dark material, a heavy  belt with silver buckle, and a white, soft shirt, with wide collar, open  at the neck. He was bareheaded.    \"I'm going to run White Slides,\" he said to the cowboys. \"What're your  names?\"    Columbine wanted to giggle, which impulse she smothered. The idea of any  one asking Jim his name! She had never been able to find out.    \"My handle is Lemuel Archibawld Billings,\" replied Lem, blandly. The  middle name was an addition no one had ever heard.    Belllounds then directed his glance and steps toward the girl. The  cowboys dropped their heads and shuffled on their way.    \"There's only one girl on the ranch,\" said Belllounds, \"so you must be  Columbine.\"    \"Yes. And you're Jack,\" she replied, and slipped off the fence. \"I'm  glad to welcome you home.\"    She offered her hand, and he held it until she extricated it. There was  genuine surprise and pleasure in his expression.    \"Well, I'd never have known you,\" he said, surveying her from head to  foot. \"It's funny. I had the clearest picture of you in mind. But you're  not at all like I imagined. The Columbine I remember was thin,  white-faced, and all eyes.\"    \"It's been a long time. Seven years,\" she replied. \"But I knew you.  You're older, taller, bigger, but the same Buster Jack.\"    \"I hope not,\" he said, frankly condemning that former self. \"Dad needs  me. He wants me to take charge here--to be a man. I'm back now. It's  good to be home. I never was worth much. Lord! I hope I don't disappoint  him again.\"    \"I hope so, too,\" she murmured. To hear him talk frankly, seriously,  like this counteracted the unfavorable impression she had received. He  seemed earnest. He looked down at the ground, where he was pushing  little pebbles with the toe of his boot. She had a good opportunity to  study his face, and availed herself of it. He did look like his father,  with his big, handsome head, and his blue eyes, bolder perhaps from  their prominence than from any direct gaze or fire. His face was pale,  and shadowed by worry or discontent. It seemed as though a repressed  character showed there. His mouth and chin were undisciplined. Columbine  could not imagine that she despised anything she saw in the features of  this young man. Yet there was something about him that held her aloof.  She had made up her mind to do her part unselfishly. She would find the  best in him, like him for it, be strong to endure and to help. Yet she  had no power to control her vague and strange perceptions. Why was it  that she could not feel in him what she liked in Jim Montana or Lem or  Wilson Moore?    \"This was my second long stay away from home,\" said Belllounds. \"The  first was when I went to school in Kansas City. I liked that. I was  sorry when they turned me out--sent me home.... But the last three years  were hell.\"    His face worked, and a shade of dark blood rippled over it.    \"Did you work?\" queried Columbine.    \"Work! It was worse than work.... Sure I worked,\" he replied.    Columbine's sharp glance sought his hands. They looked as soft and  unscarred as her own. What kind of work had he done, if he told  the truth?    \"Well, if you work hard for dad, learn to handle the cowboys, and never  take up those old bad habits--\"    \"You mean drink and cards? I swear I'd forgotten them for three  years--until yesterday. I reckon I've the better of them.\"    \"Then you'll make dad and me happy. You'll be happy, too.\"    Columbine thrilled at the touch of fineness coming out in him. There was  good in him, whatever the mad, wild pranks of his boyhood.    \"Dad wants us to marry,\" he said, suddenly, with shyness and a strange,  amused smile. \"Isn't that funny? You and me--who used to fight like cat  and dog! Do you remember the time I pushed you into the old mud-hole?  And you lay in wait for me, behind the house, to hit me with a  rotten cabbage?\"    \"Yes, I remember,\" replied Columbine, dreamily. \"It seems so long ago.\"    \"And the time you ate my pie, and how I got even by tearing off your  little dress, so you had to run home almost without a stitch on?\"    \"Guess I've forgotten that,\" replied Columbine, with a blush. \"I must  have been very little then.\"    \"You were a little devil.... Do you remember the fight I had with  Moore--about you?\"    She did not answer, for she disliked the fleeting expression that  crossed his face. He remembered too well.    \"I'll settle that score with Moore,\" he went on. \"Besides, I won't have  him on the ranch.\"    \"Dad needs good hands,\" she said, with her eyes on the gray sage slopes.  Mention of Wilson Moore augmented the aloofness in her. An annoyance  pricked along her veins.    \"Before we get any farther I'd like to know something. Has Moore ever  made love to you?\"    Columbine felt that prickling augment to a hot, sharp wave of blood. Why  was she at the mercy of strange, quick, unfamiliar sensations? Why did  she hesitate over that natural query from Jack Belllounds?    \"No. He never has,\" she replied, presently.    \"That's damn queer. You used to like him better than anybody else. You  sure hated me.... Columbine, have you outgrown that?\"    \"Yes, of course,\" she answered. \"But I hardly hated you.\"    \"Dad said you were willing to marry me. Is that so?\"    Columbine dropped her head. His question, kindly put, did not affront  her, for it had been expected. But his actual presence, the meaning of  his words, stirred in her an unutterable spirit of protest. She had  already in her will consented to the demand of the old man; she was  learning now, however, that she could not force her flesh to consent to  a surrender it did not desire.    \"Yes, I'm willing,\" she replied, bravely.    \"Soon?\" he flashed, with an eager difference in his voice.    \"If I had my way it'd not be--too soon,\" she faltered. Her downcast eyes  had seen the stride he had made closer to her, and she wanted to run.    \"Why? Dad thinks it'd be good for me,\" went on Belllounds, now, with  strong, self-centered thought. \"It'd give me responsibility. I reckon I  need it. Why not soon?\"    \"Wouldn't it be better to wait awhile?\" she asked. \"We do not know each  other--let alone care--\"    \"Columbine, I've fallen in love with you.\" he declared, hotly.    \"Oh, how could you!\" cried Columbine, incredulously.    \"Why, I always was moony over you--when we were kids,\" he said. \"And now  to meet you grown up like this--so pretty and sweet--such a--a  healthy, blooming girl....

Partly because  they did by nature without the law the things contained in the law, so  being a law to themselves, Rom. ii. 14, 15; partly, because they by  nature forbore some of those sins which were forbidden in the law, and  were practised by some that had the law, as 2 Cor. v. 1; and partly,  because according to the good and bad they did, &c., their conscience  did accuse or excuse, Rom. ii. 15. Now conscience doth not accuse or  excuse but according to some rule, principle, or law of God, (which is  above the conscience,) or at least so supposed to be. And they had no  law but the imperfect characters thereof in their own hearts, which were  not quite obliterated by the fall. Now so far as this light of nature  after the fall, is a true relic of the light of nature before the fall,  that which is according to this light may be counted of divine right in  matters of religion, which is the next thing to be proved.    For the second, how it may be proved that what things in religion are  evident by, or consonant to this true light of nature, are of divine  right. Thus briefly,    1. Because that knowledge which by the light of nature Gentiles have of  the invisible things of God, is a beam of divine light, as the apostle,  speaking of the Gentiles' light of nature, saith, That which may be  known of God is manifest in them--for God hath showed it to them. For  the invisible things, &c., Rom. i. 19, 20. God himself is the Fountain  and Author of the true light of nature; hence some not unfitly call it  the divine light of nature, not only because it hath God for its object,  but also God for its principle; now that which is according to God's  manifestation, must needs be of divine right.    2. Because the Spirit of God and of Christ in the New Testament is  pleased often to argue from the light of nature in condemning of sin, in  commending and urging of duty, as in the case of the incestuous  Corinthian; \"It is reported commonly, that there is fornication among  you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the  Gentiles,\" (who had only the light of nature to guide them,) 1 Cor. v.  1. In case of the habits of men and women in their public church  assemblies, that women's heads should be covered, men's uncovered in  praying or prophesying. \"Judge in yourselves, is it comely that a woman  pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if  a man hath long hair, it is a shame to him? but if a woman have long  hair it is a glory to her,\" &c., 1 Cor. xi. 13-15. Here the apostle  appeals plainly to the very light of nature for the regulating and  directing of their habits in church assemblies; and thus, in case of  praying or prophesying in the congregation in an unknown tongue, (unless  some do interpret,) he strongly argues against it from the light of  nature, 1 Cor. xiv. 7-11, and afterwards urges that women be silent in  their churches, from the natural uncomeliness of their speaking there,  for it is a shame for women to speak in the church, 1 Cor. xiv. 34, 35.    Now, if the Spirit of God condemn things as vicious, and commend things  as virtuous from the light of nature, is there not divine right in the  light of nature? May we not say, that which is repugnant to the light of  nature in matters of religion, is condemned by divine right; and what is  correspondent to the light of nature, is prescribed by divine right? And  if not, where is the strength or force of this kind of arguing from the  light of nature?    Consequently, in the present case of church government, that which is  agreeable to the true light of nature, must needs be confessed to be of  divine right. Though the light of nature be but dim, yet it will lend  some help in this particular: e.g. the light of nature teaches, 1. That  as every society in the world hath a distinct government of its own  within itself, without which it could not subsist, so must the Church,  which is a society, have its own distinct government within itself,  without which it cannot subsist more than any other society. 2. That in  all matters of difference the lesser number in every society should give  way to, and the matters controverted be determined and concluded by the  major part; else there would never be an end: and why not so in the  Church? 3. That in every ill administration in inferior societies the  parties aggrieved should have liberty to appeal from them to superior  societies, that equity may take place; and why not from inferior to  superior church assemblies?          CHAPTER IV.    II. _Of a Divine Right by obligatory Scripture Examples._      II. By obligatory scripture examples (which God's people are bound to  follow and imitate) matters of religion become of divine right, and by  the will and appointment of Jesus Christ, by whose Spirit those examples  were recorded in Scripture, and propounded for imitation to the saints.  The light of nature in this case helps something; but the light of  obligatory scripture examples helps much more, as being more clear,  distinct, and particular. We say scripture examples; for only these  examples are held forth to us by an infallible, impartial, divine hand,  and those scripture examples obligatory, or binding; for there are many  sorts of scripture examples that oblige not us to imitation of them,  being written for other uses and purposes.    Great use is to be made of such examples in matters of religion, and  particularly in matters of church government, for the clearing of the  divine right thereof; and great opposition is made by some against the  binding force of examples, especially by men of perverse spirits, (as  too many of the Erastian party are;) therefore it will be of great  consequence to unfold and clear this matter of scripture examples, and  the obliging power thereof, that we may see how far examples are to be a  law and rule for us by divine right. In general, this proposition seems  to be unquestionable, that whatsoever matter or act of religion Jesus  Christ makes known to his Church and people, by or under any binding  scripture example, that matter or act of religion so made known, is of  divine right, and by the will and appointment of Jesus Christ: But to  evince this more satisfactorily, these several particulars are to be  distinctly made good and manifested: 1. That some scripture examples are  obligatory and binding on Christians in matters of religion. 2. Which  are those obligatory scripture examples? These things being made out, we  shall see with what strength scripture examples hold forth a divine  right to us in the mysteries of religion, and particularly in church  government.    I. That some scripture examples in matters of religion are obligatory on  Christians, as patterns and rules, which they are bound in conscience to  follow and imitate, is evident,    1. By the divine intention of the Spirit of God, in recording and  propounding of examples in Scripture: for he records and propounds them  for this very end, that they may be imitated. Thus Christ's humility,  in washing the feet of his disciples, was intentionally propounded as an  obligatory example, binding both the disciples, and us after them, to  perform the meanest offices of love in humility to one another. \"If I  then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash  one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do  as I have done to you,\" John xiii. 4, &c., 13-15. Thus Christ's  suffering with innocence and unprovoked patience, not reviling again,  &c., is purposely propounded for all Christians to imitate, and they are  bound in conscience as well as they can to follow it--\"Christ suffered  for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps,\" &c., 1  Pet. ii. 21-23. Hence, the apostle so urges the example of Christ for  the Corinthians to follow in their bounty to the poor saints, yea,  though to their own impoverishing, \"For you know the grace of our Lord  Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became  poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich,\" 2 Cor. viii. 9. Nor  was the example of Christ only written for our imitation; but the  examples of the apostles also in the primitive churches were  intentionally left upon record for this end, that they might be binding  patterns for us to follow in like cases in after ages. And in  particular, this seems to be one singular ground, scope, and intention  of Christ's Spirit in writing the history of the Acts of the Apostles,  that the apostles' acts in the primitive churches might be our rules in  successive churches. For, 1. Though this book contain in it many things  dogmatical, that is, divers doctrines of the apostles, yet it is not  styled the book of the doctrine, but of the Acts of the Apostles, that  we may learn to act as they acted. This being one main difference  between profane and sacred histories; those are for speculation, these  also for admonition and imitation, 1 Cor. x. 11. The history, therefore,  of the Acts propounds examples admonitory and obligatory upon us, that  we should express like acts in like cases. 2. Luke (the penman of the  Acts) makes such a transition from his history of Christ, to this  history of Christ's apostles, as to unite and knit them into one volume,  Acts i. 1; whence we are given to understand, that if the Church wanted  this history of the apostles, she should want that perfect direction  which the Spirit intended for her: as also that this book is useful and  needful to her as well as the other. 3. In the very front of the Acts it  is said, that _Christ after his resurrection_ (and before his ascension)  _gave commandments to the apostles--and spake of the things pertaining  to the kingdom of God_, Acts i. 2, 3; viz. of "]]]
