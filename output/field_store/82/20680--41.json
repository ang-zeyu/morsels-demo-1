The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea        In a beautiful pea-green boat:      They took some honey, and plenty of money        Wrapped up in a five-pound note.      The Owl looked up to the stars above,        And sang to a small guitar,     \"O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,          What a beautiful Pussy you are,            You are,            You are!        What a beautiful Pussy you are!\"                          II.        Pussy said to the Owl, \"You elegant fowl,        How charmingly sweet you sing!      Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried:        But what shall we do for a ring?\"      They sailed away, for a year and a day,        To the land where the bong-tree grows;      And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,        With a ring at the end of his nose,            His nose,            His nose,        With a ring at the end of his nose.                          III.        \"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling        Your ring?\" Said the Piggy, \"I will.\"      So they took it away, and were married next day        By the Turkey who lives on the hill.      They dined on mince and slices of quince,        Which they ate with a runcible spoon;      And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,        They danced by the light of the moon,            The moon,            The moon,      They danced by the light of the moon.    [Illustration]          THE DUCK AND THE KANGAROO.    [Illustration]                        I.        Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,         \"Good gracious! how you hop      Over the fields, and the water too,          As if you never would stop!      My life is a bore in this nasty pond;      And I long to go out in the world beyond:          I wish I could hop like you,\"          Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.                          II.       \"Please give me a ride on your back,\"          Said the Duck to the Kangaroo:     \"I would sit quite still, and say nothing but 'Quack'          The whole of the long day through;      And we 'd go the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,      Over the land, and over the sea:          Please take me a ride! oh, do!\"          Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.                  [Illustration]                          III.        Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,         \"This requires some little reflection.      Perhaps, on the whole, it might bring me luck;          And there seems but one objection;      Which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,      Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,          And would probably give me the roo-          Matiz,\" said the Kangaroo.                  [Illustration]                          IV.        Said the Duck, \"As I sate on the rocks,          I have thought over that completely;      And I bought four pairs of worsted socks,          Which fit my web-feet neatly;      And, to keep out the cold, I've bought a cloak;      And every day a cigar I'll smoke;          All to follow my own dear true          Love of a Kangaroo.\"                          V.        Said the Kangaroo, \"I'm ready,          All in the moonlight pale;      But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady,          And quite at the end of my tail.\"      So away they went with a hop and a bound;      And they hopped the whole world three times round.          And who so happy, oh! who,          As the Duck and the Kangaroo?                 [Illustration]          THE DADDY LONG-LEGS AND THE FLY.    [Illustration]                        I.        Once Mr. Daddy Long-legs,          Dressed in brown and gray,      Walked about upon the sands          Upon a summer's day:      And there among the pebbles,          When the wind was rather cold,      He met with Mr. Floppy Fly,          All dressed in blue and gold;      And, as it was too soon to dine,      They drank some periwinkle-wine,      And played an hour or two, or more,      At battlecock and shuttledore.                          II.        Said Mr. Daddy Long-legs          To Mr. Floppy Fly,      \"Why do you never come to court?          I wish you 'd tell me why.      All gold and shine, in dress so fine,          You'd quite delight the court.      Why do you never go at all?          I really think you _ought_.      And, if you went, you'd see such sights!      Such rugs and jugs and candle-lights!      And, more than all, the king and queen,--      One in red, and one in green.\"                          III.        \"O Mr. Daddy Long-legs!\"          Said Mr. Floppy Fly,      \"It's true I never go to court;          And I will tell you why.      If I had six long legs like yours,          At once I'd go to court;      But, oh! I can't, because _my_ legs          Are so extremely short.      And I'm afraid the king and queen      (One in red, and one in green)      Would say aloud, 'You are not fit,      You Fly, to come to court a bit!'\"                          IV.        \"Oh, Mr. Daddy Long-legs!\"          Said Mr. Floppy Fly,      \"I wish you 'd sing one little song,          One mumbian melody.      You used to sing so awful well          In former days gone by;      But now you never sing at all:          I wish you'd tell me why:      For, if you would, the silvery sound      Would please the shrimps and cockles round,      And all the crabs would gladly come      To hear you sing, 'Ah, Hum di Hum!'\"                          V.        Said Mr. Daddy Long-legs,         \"I can never sing again;      And, if you wish, I'll tell you why,          Although it gives me pain.      For years I cannot hum a bit,          Or sing the smallest song;      And this the dreadful reason is,--          My legs are grown too long!      My six long legs, all here and there,      Oppress my bosom with despair;      And, if I stand or lie or sit,      I cannot sing one single bit!\"                          VI.        So Mr. Daddy Long-legs          And Mr. Floppy Fly      Sat down in silence by the sea,          And gazed upon the sky.      They said, \"This is a dreadful thing!          The world has all gone wrong,      Since one has legs too short by half,          The other much too long.      One never more can go to court,      Because his legs have grown too short;      The other cannot sing a song,      Because his legs have grown too long!\"                          VII.        Then Mr. Daddy Long-legs          And Mr. Floppy Fly      Rushed downward to the foamy sea          With one sponge-taneous cry:      And there they found a little boat,          Whose sails were pink and gray;      And off they sailed among the waves,          Far and far away:      They sailed across the silent main,      And reached the great Gromboolian Plain;      And there they play forevermore      At battlecock and shuttledore.    [Illustration]          THE JUMBLIES.    [Illustration]                        I.        They went to sea in a sieve, they did;          In a sieve they went to sea:      In spite of all their friends could say,      On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,          In a sieve they went to sea.      And when the sieve turned round and round,      And every one cried, \"You'll all be drowned!\"      They called aloud, \"Our sieve ain't big;      But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:          In a sieve we'll go to sea!\"               Far and few, far and few,          Are the lands where the Jumblies live:               Their heads are green, and their hands are blue          And they went to sea in a sieve.                           II.        They sailed away in a sieve, they did,          In a sieve they sailed so fast,      With only a beautiful pea-green veil      Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,          To a small tobacco-pipe mast.      And every one said who saw them go,     \"Oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?      For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;      And, happen what may, it's extremely wrong          In a sieve to sail so fast.\"              Far and few, far and few,          Are the lands where the Jumblies live:              Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;          And they went to sea in a sieve.                           III.        The water it soon came in, it did;          The water it soon came in:      So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet          In a pinky paper all folded neat;      And they fastened it down with a pin.      And they passed the night in a crockery-jar;      And each of them said, \"How wise we are!      Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,      Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,          While round in our sieve we spin.\"              Far and few, far and few,          Are the lands where the Jumblies live:              Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;          And they went to sea in a sieve.                           IV.        And all night long they sailed away;          And when the sun went down,      They whistled and warbled a moony song          To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,      In the shade of the mountains brown.     \"O Timballoo! How happy we are      When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!      And all night long, in the moonlight pale,      We sail away with a pea-green sail          In the shade of the mountains brown.\"      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#6)"],[1,"or  conditions, one after another, in order that you may realize that they  are merely something _incident_ to you, and _not_ YOU yourself--that you  may set them aside and consider them, just as you might anything that you  have been using. You cannot set the \"I\" aside and so consider it, but the  various forms of the \"not I\" may be so set aside and considered.    In the First Lesson you gained the perception of the \"I\" as independent  from the body, the latter merely being an instrument for use. You have  now arrived at the stage when the \"I\" appears to you to be a mental  creature--a bundle of thoughts, feelings, moods, etc. But you must go  farther. You must be able to distinguish the \"I\" from these mental  conditions, which are as much tools as is the body and its parts.    Let us begin by considering the thoughts more closely connected with the  body, and then work up to the higher mental states.    The sensations of the body, such as hunger; thirst; pain; pleasurable  sensations; physical desires, etc., etc., are not apt to be mistaken for  essential qualities of the \"I\" by many of the Candidates, for they have  passed beyond this stage, and have learned to set aside these sensations,  to a greater or lesser extent, by an effort of the Will, and are no  longer slaves to them. Not that they do not experience these sensations,  but they have grown to regard them as incidents of the physical  life--good in their place--but useful to the advanced man only when he  has mastered them to the extent that he no longer regards them as close  to the \"I.\" And yet, to some people, these sensations are so closely  identified with their conception of the \"I\" that when they think of  themselves they think merely of a bundle of these sensations. They are  not able to set them aside and consider them as things apart, to be used  when necessary and proper, but as things not fastened to the \"I.\" The  more advanced a man becomes the farther off seem these sensations. Not  that he does not feel hungry, for instance. Not at all, for he recognizes  hunger, and satisfies it within reason, knowing that his physical body is  making demands for attention, and that these demands should be heeded.  But--mark the difference--instead of feeling that the \"_I_\" is hungry the  man feels that \"_my body_\" is hungry, just as he might become conscious  that his horse or dog was crying for food insistently. Do you see what  we mean? It is that the man no longer identifies himself--the \"I\"--with  the body, consequently the thoughts which are most closely allied to the  physical life seem comparatively \"separate\" from his \"I\" conception. Such  a man thinks \"my stomach, this,\" or \"my leg, that,\" or \"my body, thus,\"  instead of \"'I,' this,\" or \"'I' that.\" He is able, almost automatically,  to think of the body and its sensations as things _of_ him, and  _belonging to_ him, which require attention and care, rather than as real  parts of the \"I.\" He is able to form a conception of the \"I\" as existing  without any of these things--without the body and its sensations--and so  he has taken the first step in the realization of the \"I.\"    Before going on, we ask the students to stop a few moments, and mentally  run over these sensations of the body. Form a mental image of them, and  realize that they are merely incidents to the present stage of growth and  experience of the \"I,\" and that they form no real part of it. They may,  and will be, left behind in the Ego's higher planes of advancement. You  may have attained this mental conception perfectly, long since, but we  ask that to give yourself the mental drill at this time, in order to  fasten upon your mind this first step.    In realizing that you are able to set aside, mentally, these  sensations--that you are able to hold them out at arm's length and  \"consider\" them as an \"outside\" thing, you mentally determine that they  are \"not I\" things, and you set them down in the \"not I\" collection--the  first to be placed there. Let us try to make this still plainer, even at  the risk of wearying you by repetitions (for you must get this idea  firmly fixed in your mind). To be able to say that a thing is \"not I,\"  you must realize that there are two things in question (1) the \"not I\"  thing, and (2) the \"I\" who is regarding the \"not I\" thing just as the \"I\"  regards a lump of sugar, or a mountain. Do you see what we mean? Keep at  it until you do.    Next, consider some of the emotions, such as anger; hate; love, in its  ordinary forms; jealousy; ambition; and the hundred and one other  emotions that sweep through our brains. You will find that you are able  to set each one of these emotions or feelings aside and study it; dissect  it; analyze it; consider it. You will be able to understand the rise,  progress and end of each of these feelings, as they have come to you, and  as you recall them in your memory or imagination, just as readily as you  would were you observing their occurrence in the mind of a friend. You  will find them all stored away in some parts of your mental make-up, and  you may (to use a modern American slang phrase) \"make them trot before  you, and show their paces.\" Don't you see that they are not \"You\"--that  they are merely something that you carry around with you in a mental bag.  You can imagine yourself as living without them, and still being \"I,\" can  you not?    And the very fact that you are able to set them aside and examine and  consider them is a proof that they are \"not I\" things--for there are two  things in the matter (1) _You_ who are examining and considering them,  and (2) the thing itself which is the _object_ of the examination and  consideration at mental arm's length. So into the \"not I\" collection go  these emotions, desirable and undesirable. The collection is steadily  growing, and will attain quite formidable proportions after a while.    Now, do not imagine that this is a lesson designed to teach you how to  discard these emotions, although if it enables you to get rid of the  undesirable ones, so much the better. This is not our object, for we bid  you place the desirable (at this time) ones in with the opposite kind,  the idea being to bring you to a realization that the \"I\" is higher,  above and independent of these mental somethings, and then when you have  realized the nature of the \"I,\" you may return and use (as a Master) the  things that have been using you as a slave. So do not be afraid to throw  these emotions (good and bad) into the \"not I\" collection. You may go  back to them, and use the good ones, after the Mental Drill is over. No  matter how much you may think that you are bound by any of these  emotions, you will realize, by careful analysis, that it is of the \"not  I\" kind, for the \"I\" existed before the emotion came into active play,  and it will live long after the emotion has faded away. The principal  proof is that you are able to hold it out at arm's length and examine  it--a proof that it is \"not I.\"    Run through the entire list of your feelings; emotions; moods; and what  not, just as you would those of a well-known friend or relative, and you  will see that each one--every one--is a \"not I\" thing, and you will lay  it aside for the time, for the purpose of the scientific experiment, at  least.    Then passing on to the Intellect, you will be able to hold out for  examination each mental process and principle. You don't believe it, you  may say. Then read and study some good work on Psychology, and you will  learn to dissect and analyze every intellectual process--and to classify  it and place it in the proper pigeon-hole. Study Psychology by means of  some good text-book, and you will find that one by one every intellectual  process is classified, and talked about and labeled, just as you would a  collection of flowers. If that does not satisfy you, turn the leaves of  some work on Logic, and you will admit that you may hold these  intellectual processes at arm's length and examine them, and talk about  them to others. So that these wonderful tools of Man--the Intellectual  powers may be placed in the \"not I\" collection, for the \"I\" is capable of  standing aside and viewing them--it is able to detach them from itself.  The most remarkable thing about this is that in admitting this fact, you  realize that the \"I\" is using these very intellectual faculties to pass  upon themselves. Who is the Master that compels these faculties to do  this to themselves? The Master of the Mind--The \"I.\"    And reaching the higher regions of the mind--even the Spiritual Mind, you  will be compelled to admit that the things that have come into  consciousness from that region may be considered and studied, just as may  be any other mental thing, and so even these high things must be placed  in the \"not I\" collection. You may object that this does not prove that  all the things in the Spiritual Mind may be so treated--that there may be  \"I\" things there that can not be so treated. We will not discuss this  question, for you know nothing about the Spiritual Mind except as it has  revealed itself to you, and the higher regions of that mind are like the  mind of a God, when compared to what _you_ call mind. But the evidence of  the Illumined--those in whom the Spiritual Mind has wonderfully unfolded  tell us that even in the highest forms of development, the Initiates,  yea, even the Masters, realize that above even their highest mental  states there is always that eternal \"I\" brooding over them, as the Sun  over the lake; and that the highest conception of the \"I\" known even to  advanced souls, is but a faint reflection of the \"I\" filtering through  the Spiritual Mind, although that Spiritual Mind is as clear as the  clearest crystal when compared with our comparatively opaque mental  states. And the highest mental state is but a tool or instrument of the  \"I,\" and is not the \"I\" itself.    And yet the \"I\" is to be found in the faintest"]]]
