Accordingly, it is  a great relief to find him occasionally trying his hand on the early  legends of New England and Canada, which do not suffer such ballads as  _St. John_....    \"Whittier is less known than several other Western bards to the  English reader, and we think him entitled to stand higher on the  American Parnassus than most of his countrymen would place him. His  faults--harshness and want of polish--are evident; but there is  more life, and spirit, and soul in his verses, than in those of  eight-ninths of Mr. Griswold's immortal ninety.    \"From political verse (for the anti-slavery agitation must be  considered quite as much a political as a moral warfare) the  transition is natural to satire and humorous poetry. Here we find no  lack of matter, but a grievous short-coming in quality. The Americans  are no contemptible humorists in prose, but their fun cannot be set  to verse. They are very fond of writing parodies, yet we have scarcely  ever seen a good parody of American origin. And their satire is  generally more distinguished for personality and buffoonery than  wit. Halleck's _Fanny_ looks as if it might be good, did we only know  something of the people satirized in it. The reputed comic poet of the  country at present is OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, a physician. Whether  it was owing to the disappointment caused by hearing too much in his  praise beforehand we will not pretend to say, but it certainly did  seem to us that Dr. Holmes' efforts in this line must originally  have been intended to act upon his patients emetically. After a  conscientious perusal of the doctor, the most readable, and about the  only presentable thing we can find in him, is the bit of seriocomic  entitled _The Last Leaf_.    \"But within the last three years there has arisen in the United States  a satirist of genuine excellence, who, however, besides being but  moderately appreciated by his countrymen, seems himself in a great  measure to have mistaken his real forte. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, one of  the Boston coterie, has for some time been publishing verses, which  are by the coterie duly glorified, but which are in no respect  distinguishable from the ordinary level of American poetry, except  that they combine an extraordinary pretension to originality, with a  more than usually palpable imitation of English models. Indeed, the  failure was so manifest, that the American literati seem, in this  one case, to have rebelled against Boston dictation, and there is  sufficient internal evidence that such of them as do duty for critics  handled Mr. Lowell pretty severely. Violently piqued at this, and  simultaneously conceiving a disgust for the Mexican war, he was  impelled by both feelings to take the field as a satirist: to the  former we owe the _Fable for Critics_; to the latter, the _Biglow  Papers_. It was a happy move, for he has the rare faculty of writing  _clever doggerel_. Take out the best of _Ingoldsby_, Campbell's rare  piece of fun _The Friars of Dijon_, and perhaps a little of Walsh's  _Aristophanes_, and there is no contemporary verse of the class with  which Lowell's may not fearlessly stand a comparison; for, observe, we  are not speaking of mock heroics like Bon Gaultier's, which are only  a species of parody, but of real doggerel, the Rabelaisque of poetry.  The _Fable_ is somewhat on the Ingoldsby model,--that is to say, a  good part of its fun consists in queer rhymes, double, treble,  or poly-syllabic; and it has even Barham's fault--an occasional  over-consciousness of effort, and calling on the reader to admire, as  if the _tour de force_ could not speak for itself. But _Ingoldsby's_  rhymes will not give us a just idea of the _Fable_ until we superadd  Hook's puns; for the fabulist has a pleasant knack of making  puns--outrageous and unhesitating ones--exactly of the kind to set  off the general style of his verse. The sternest critic could hardly  help relaxing over such a bundle of them as are contained in Apollo's  lament over the 'treeification' of his Daphne.... The _Fable_ is a  sort of review in verse of American poets. Much of the Boston leaven  runs through it; the wise men of the East are all glorified intensely,  while Bryant and Halleck are studiously depreciated. But though thus  freely exercising his own critical powers in verse, the author is most  bitter against all critics in prose, and gives us a ludicrous picture  of one--      A terrible fellow to meet in society,    Not the toast that he buttered was ever so dry at tea.    And this gentleman is finely shown up for his condemnatory  predilections and inability to discern or appreciate beauties. The  cream of the joke against him is, that being sent by Apollo to  choose a lily in a flower-garden, he brings back a thistle as all he  could find. The picture is a humorous one, but we are at a loss to  conjecture who can have sat for it in America, where the tendency  is all the other way, reviewers being apt to apply the butter of  adulation with the knife of profusion to every man, woman, or child  who rushes into print. Some of his complaints, too, against the critic  sound very odd; as, for instance, that      His lore was engraft, something foreign that grew in him.    Surely the very meaning of _learning_ is that it is something which  a man learns--_acquires_ from other sources--does not originate in  himself. But it is a favorite practice with Mr. Lowell's set to rail  against dry learning and pedants, while at the same time there are no  men more fond of showing off cheap learning than themselves: Lowell  himself never loses an opportunity of bringing in a bit of Greek or  Latin. Our readers must have known such persons--for, unfortunately,  the United States has no monopoly of them--men who delight in quoting  Latin before ladies, talking Penny-Magazine science in the hearing of  clodhoppers, and preaching of high art to youths who have never had  the chance of seeing any art at all. _Then_ you will hear them say  nothing about pedantry. But let a man be present who knows more Greek  than they do, or who has a higher standard of poetry or painting or  music, and wo be to him! Him they will persecute to the uttermost.  What is to be done with such men but to treat them _a la_ Shandon,  'Give them Burton's _Anatomy_, and leave them to their own abominable  devices?'    \"The _Biglow Papers_ are imaginary epistles from a New England farmer,  and contain some of the best specimens extant of the 'Yankee,' or New  England dialect,--better than Haliburton's, for Sam Slick sometimes  mixes Southern, Western, and even English vulgarities with his Yankee.  Mr. Biglow's remarks treat chiefly of the Mexican war, and subjects  immediately connected with it, such as slavery, truckling of  Northerners to the south, &c. The theme is treated in various ways  with uniform bitterness. Now he sketches a 'Pious Editors Creed,'  almost too daring in its Scriptural allusions, but terribly severe  upon the venal fraternity. At another time he sets one of Calhoun's  pro-slavery speeches to music. The remarks of the great Nullifier form  the air of the song, and the incidental remarks of honorable senators  on the same side make up a rich chorus, their names supplying happy  tags to the rhymes. But best of all are the letters of his friend the  returned volunteer, Mr. Birdofredom Sawin, who draws a sad picture  of the private soldier's life in Mexico. He had gone out with hopes  of making his fortune. But he was sadly disappointed and equally so  in his expectations of glory, which 'never got so low down as the  privates.'    \"But it is time to bring this notice to a close not, however, that  we have by any means exhausted the subject. For have we not already  stated that there are, at the lowest calculation, ninety American  poets, spreading all over the alphabet, from Allston, who is  unfortunately dead, to Willis, who is fortunately living, and writing  _Court Journals_ for the 'Upper Ten Thousand,' as he has named the  quasi-aristocracy of New York? And the lady-poets--the poetesses, what  shall we say of them? Truly it would be ungallant to say anything ill  of them, and invidious to single out a few among so many; therefore,  it will be best for us to say--nothing at all about any of them.\"           *       *       *       *       *          ORIGINAL POETRY.      A RETROSPECT.    BY HERMANN.        On this rustic footbridge sitting,      I have passed delightful eyes,    Moonbeams round about me flitting      Through the overhanging leaves.      With me often came another,      When the west wore hues of gold,    And 'twas neither sister--brother--      One the heart may dearer hold.      She was fair and lightly moulded,      Azure eyed and full of grace;    Gentler form was never folded      In a lover's warm embrace.      Oh those hours of sacred converse,      Their communion now is o'er    And our straying feet shall traverse      Those remembered paths no more.      Hours they were of love and gladness,      Fraught with holy vows of truth:    Not a single thought of sadness      Shadowing o'er the hopes of youth.      I am sitting sad and lonely      Where she often sat with me,    And the voice I hear is only      Of the silvery streamlet's glee.      Where is she, whose gentle fingers,      Oft were wreathed amidst my hair?    Still methinks their pressure lingers,      But, ah no! they are not there.      They are whiter now than ever,      In a light I know not of,    Sweeping o'er the chords of silver      To a song of joy and love.      Though so lonely I am sitting,      This sweet thought of joy may bring,    That she still is round me flitting,      On an angel's tireless wing.           *       *       *       *       *    THE AUTHOR OF \"ION.\"      \"Mr. Talfourd is now a Justice, and we find in the London journals an  account of a visit to his residence by a deputation from his native  town,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],[0,"Nonsense Songs (#6)"],[1,"there was a large  well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one  of them drowned in less than half a minute.    So that was the end of the seven young Owls.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER IX.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GUINEA PIGS.    The seven young Guinea Pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes  and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. When they awoke,  they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had  been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. At which  they all exclaimed,--       \"Lettuce! O lettuce      Let us, O let us,      O lettuce-leaves,      O let us leave this tree, and eat      Lettuce, O let us, lettuce-leaves!\"    And instantly the seven young Guinea Pigs rushed with such extreme force  against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its  stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional  inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and  worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.    And that was the end of the seven young Guinea Pigs.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER X.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG CATS.    The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight and  rapacity. But, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a  long distance off a Clangle-Wangle (or, as it is more properly written,  Clangel-Wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran  straight up to it.    (Now, the Clangle-Wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no  means commonly to be met with. They live in the water as well as on land,  using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. Their speed is  extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their  general demeanor pensive and pellucid. On summer evenings, they may  sometimes be observed near the Lake Pipple-Popple, standing on their heads,  and humming their national melodies. They subsist entirely on vegetables,  excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or  saltpetre.)    The moment the Clangle-Wangle saw the seven young Cats approach, he ran  away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the Cats, though they  continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually _died_ of  fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.    And this was the end of the seven young Cats.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER XI.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG FISHES.    The seven young Fishes swam across the Lake Pipple-Popple, and into the  river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily for them, they saw, on the  fifteenth day of their travels, a bright-blue Boss-Woss, and instantly swam  after him. But the Blue Boss-Woss plunged into a      perpendicular,          spicular,              orbicular,                  quadrangular,                       circular depth of soft mud;  where, in fact, his house was.    And the seven young Fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity,  plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being  accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.    And that was the end of the seven young Fishes.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER XII.    OF WHAT OCCURRED SUBSEQUENTLY.    After it was known that the                seven young Parrots,      and the seven young Storks,      and the seven young Geese,      and the seven young Owls,      and the seven young Guinea Pigs,      and the seven young Cats,      and the seven young Fishes,    were all dead, then the Frog, and the Plum-pudding Flea, and the Mouse, and  the Clangle-Wangle, and the Blue Boss-Woss, all met together to rejoice  over their good fortune. And they collected the seven feathers of the seven  young Parrots, and the seven bills of the seven young Storks, and the  lettuce, and the cherry; and having placed the latter on the lettuce, and  the other objects in a circular arrangement at their base, they danced a  hornpipe round all these memorials until they were quite tired; after which  they gave a tea-party, and a garden-party, and a ball, and a concert, and  then returned to their respective homes full of joy and respect, sympathy,  satisfaction, and disgust.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER XIII.    OF WHAT BECAME OF THE PARENTS OF THE FORTY-NINE CHILDREN.    BUT when the two old Parrots,       and the two old Storks,       and the two old Geese,       and the two old Owls,       and the two old Guinea Pigs,       and the two old Cats,       and the two old Fishes,    became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of  the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and,  sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of Cayenne  pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense  glass bottles with air-tight stoppers. And, having done this, they ate a  light supper of brown-bread and Jerusalem artichokes, and took an  affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was  very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.      CHAPTER XIV.    CONCLUSION.    And after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling,  and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course,  they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes;  having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent  lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the  stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue  sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles,  should be presented to the principal museum of the city of Tosh, to be  labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be  placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection  and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous  public.    And if you ever happen to go to Gramble-Blamble, and visit that museum in  the city of Tosh, look for them on the ninety-eighth table in the four  hundred and twenty-seventh room of the right-hand corridor of the left wing  of the central quadrangle of that magnificent building; for, if you do not,  you certainly will not see them.

Extract from \"The Nonsense Gazette,\" for August, 1870.    \"Our readers will be interested in the following communications from our  valued and learned contributor, Prof. Bosh, whose labors in the fields of  culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world. The  first three articles richly merit to be added to the domestic cookery of  every family: those which follow claim the attention of all botanists; and  we are happy to be able, through Dr. Bosh's kindness, to present our  readers with illustrations of his discoveries. All the new flowers are  found in the Valley of Verrikwier, near the Lake of Oddgrow, and on the  summit of the Hill Orfeltugg.\"        THREE RECEIPTS FOR DOMESTIC COOKERY.      TO MAKE AN AMBLONGUS PIE.    Take 4 pounds (say 4-1/2 pounds) of fresh Amblongusses, and put them in a  small pipkin.    Cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which  add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.    When you have ascertained that the Amblongusses are quite soft, take them  out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well  previously.    Grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered  gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of Cayenne pepper.    Remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor. Bring it back  again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour. Shake the pan  violently till all the Amblongusses have become of a pale purple color.    Then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully; adding at the  same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers, and any number  of oysters.    Watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from  time to time.    Serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window as fast as  possible.      TO MAKE CRUMBOBBLIOUS CUTLETS.    Procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the smallest  possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,--eight, or perhaps  nine times.    When the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new  clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon  or a soup-ladle.    Place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,--say the  roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,--and leave it  there for about a week.    At the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a  few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with 4 gallons of clarified  Crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready for use.    Cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean  table-cloth or dinner-napkin.      TO MAKE GOSKY PATTIES.    Take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off hind-leg to a  post. Place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2 pecks of peas, 18 roast  chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips, within his reach: if he eats  these, constantly provide him with more.    Then procure some cream, some slices of Cheshire cheese, 4 quires of  foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. Work the whole into a paste,  and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean brown waterproof linen.    When the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat the pig  violently with the handle of a large broom. If he squeals, beat him again.    Visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and ascertain  if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn"]]]
