Beginning with the adiabatic curve, we find that for one volume of air  when compressed without cooling the curve intersects the first vertical  line at a point between 0.6 and 0.7 volume, the gauge pressure being  14.7 pounds. If we assume that this air was admitted to the compressor  at a temperature of zero, it will reach about 100 degrees when the gauge  pressure is 14.7 pounds. We find this by following down the first line  intersected by the adiabatic curve to the point where the zero heat  curve intersects this same line, the reading being given in figures to  the left immediately opposite. If the air had been admitted to the  compressor at 60 degrees, it would register about 176 degrees at 14.7  pounds gauge pressure. If the air were 100 degrees before compression,  it would go up to about 230 degrees at this pressure. Following this  adiabatic curve until it intersects line No. 5, representing a pressure  of five atmospheres above a vacuum (58.8 lb. gauge pressure), we see  that the total increase of temperature on the zero heat curve is about  270 degrees, for the 60 degree curve it is about 370 degrees, and for  the 100 degree curve it is about 435 degrees. The diagram shows that  when a volume of air is compressed adiabatically to 21 atmospheres (294  lb. gauge pressure), it will occupy a volume a little more than  one-tenth; the total increase of temperature with an initial temperature  of zero is about 650 degrees; with 60 degrees initial temperature it is  800 degrees, and with 100 degrees initial it is 900 degrees. It will be  observed that the zero heat curve is flatter than the others, indicating  that when free air is admitted to a compressor cold, the relative  increase of temperature is less than when the air is hot. This points to  the importance of low initial temperature.    We have now seen that the economical production of compressed air  depends upon the following conditions:    (1) A low initial temperature.    (2) Thorough cooling during compression.    It has been demonstrated by experiments made in France that the power  required to compress moist air is less than that for dry air. A table  showing the power required to compress moist and dry air has been  prepared from the data of M. Mallard and shows that for five atmospheres  the work expended in compressing one pound of dry air is 58,500 foot  pounds, while that for moist air is 52,500 foot pounds. In expansion  also moisture in the air adds to the economy, but in both cases the  saving of power is not great enough to compensate for the many  disadvantages due to the presence of water. Mr. Norman Selfe, of the  Engineering Association of N.S.W., has compiled a table which shows some  important theoretical conditions involved in producing compressed air.    So much for the theory of compression. We now come to the practical  production of compressed air.    The first record that we have of the use of an air compressor is at  Ramsgate Harbor, Kent, in the year 1788. Smeaton invented this \"pump\"  for use in a diving apparatus. In 1851, William Cubitt, at Rochester  Bridge, and a little later an engineer, Brunel, at Saltash, used  compressed air for bridge work. But the first notable application of  compressed air is due to Professor Colladon, of Geneva, whose plans were  adopted at the Mont Cenis tunnel. M. Sommeiller developed the Colladon  idea and constructed the compressed air plant illustrated in Fig. 2.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The Sommeiller compressor was operated as a ram, utilizing a natural  head of water to force air at 80 pounds pressure into a receiver. The  column of water contained in the long pipe on the side of the hill was  started and stopped automatically, by valves controlled by engines. The  weight and momentum of the water forced a volume of air with such shock  against a discharge valve that it was opened and the air was discharged  into the tank; the valve was then closed, the water checked; a portion  of it was allowed to discharge and the space was filled with air, which  was in turn forced into the tank. The efficiency of this compressor was  about 50 per cent.    At the St. Gothard tunnel, begun in 1872, Prof. Colladon first  introduced the injection of water in the form of spray into the  compressor cylinder to absorb the heat of compression.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    Fig. 3 illustrates the air cylinder of the Dubois-Francois type of  compressor, which was the best in use about the year 1876. This  compressor was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition and was adopted by  Mr. Sutro in the construction of the Sutro tunnel. A characteristic  feature seems to be to get as much water into the cylinder as possible.  The water which flooded the bottom of the cylinder arose from the  voluminous injection; this water was pushed into the end of the cylinder  and some of it escaped with the air through the discharge valve.    An improved pattern of this compressor is shown in Fig. 4.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    These illustrations are interesting from an historical point of view, as  indicating the line of thought which early designers of air-compressing  machinery followed. As the necessity for compressed air power grew,  inventors turned their attention to the construction of air-compressing  engines that would combine _efficiency_ with _light weight_ and _economy  of space and cost_. The trade demanded compressors at inaccessible  localities, and in many cases it was preferred to sacrifice isothermal  results to simplicity of construction and low cost.    It is evident that an air compressor which has the steam cylinder and  the air cylinder on a single straight rod will apply the power in the  most direct manner, and will involve the simplest mechanics in the  construction of its parts. It is evident, however, that this straight  line, or direct construction, results in an engine which has the  greatest power at a time when there is no work to perform. At the  beginning of the stroke steam at the boiler pressure is admitted behind  the piston, and, as the air piston at that time is also at the initial  point in the stroke, it has only free air against it. The two pistons  move simultaneously, and the resistance in the air cylinder rapidly  increases as the air is compressed. To get economical results it is, of  course, necessary to cut off in the steam cylinder, so that at the end  of the stroke, when the steam pressure is low, as indicated by the  dotted line (Fig. 5), the air pressure is high, as similarly indicated.  The early direct-acting compressor used steam at full pressure  throughout the stroke. The Westinghouse pump, applied to locomotives, is  built on this principle, and those who have observed it work have  perhaps noticed that its speed of stroke is not uniform, but that it  moves rapidly at the beginning, gradually reducing its speed, and seems  to labor, until the direction of stroke is reversed. This construction  is admitted to be wasteful, but in some cases, notably that of the  Westinghouse pump, economy in steam consumption is sacrificed to  lightness and economy of space.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    Many efforts were made to equalize the power and resistance by  constructing the air compressor on the crank shaft principle, putting  the cranks at various angles, and by angular positions of steam and air  cylinders. Several types are shown in Fig. 6.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    Angular positions of the cylinder involve expensive construction and  unsteadiness. Experience has conclusively proved that it does not pay to  build air compressors with vertical cylinders, and moreover we have  found out that there is nothing in the apparent difficulty in equalizing  the strains in a direct-acting engine. It is simply necessary to add  enough weight to the moving parts, that is, to the piston, piston rod,  fly wheel, etc., to cut off early in the stroke and secure rotative  speed with the most economical results and with the cheapest  construction. It is obvious that the theoretically perfect air  compressor is a direct-acting one with a conical air cylinder, the base  of the cone being nearest the steam cylinder. This, from a practical  point of view, is impossible. Mr. Hill, in referring to the fallacious  tendencies of pneumatic engineers to equalize power and resistance in  air compressors, says: \"The ingenuity of mechanics has been taxed and a  great variety of devices have been employed. It is usual to build on the  pattern of presses which do their work in a few inches of the end of the  stroke and employ heavy fly wheels, extra strong connections, and  prodigious bed plates. Counterpoise weights are also attached to such  machines; the steam is allowed to follow full stroke, steam cylinders  are placed at awkward angles to the air-compressing cylinders and the  motion conveyed through yokes, toggles, levers; and many joints and  other devices are used, many of which are entire failures, while some  are used with questionable engineering skill and very poor results.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    Fig. 7 illustrates the theory of Duplex Air Compressors. The hydraulic  piston or plunger compressor is largely used in Germany and elsewhere on  the Continent of Europe, but the duplex may be said to be the standard  type of European compressor at the present time. It is also largely used  in this country. Fig. 7 shows the four cylinders of a duplex compressor  in two positions of the stroke. It will be observed that each steam  cylinder has an air cylinder connected directly to the tail rod of its  piston, so that it is a direct-acting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11662"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 598, June 18, 1887 (#6)"],[1,", a screw with a large positive slip  in smooth water is frequently inefficient at sea against a head wind, which  increases the resistance, and necessitates an increase of slip. I venture  to say that these statements, taken in a general manner, are not at  variance with experience obtained from the performances of screw ships.  Before it is possible to satisfactorily decide if this curve applies in a  general manner to full sized screws propelling ships, we require the  results of trials of various ships where the screws are working about the  region of no slip. Model experiments teach that the scale for the slip  varies with the design of the screw, and that with a given screw the speed  of the wake (which decides the point of no apparent slip) varies with the  type of ship and with the position of the screw with respect to the hull.  Remembering these disturbances, it is not improbable that it may be  possible to account for or explain what at first sight may appear  departures from the curve. The diameters of the screws in the table are not  compared with the diameters given by the method explained by Mr. Froude in  his paper last year, for there are differences in the slips, the  proportions of blade area to disk, and, to some extent, in the shapes of  the blades, which are not taken into account in that method. Assuming,  however, as Mr. Froude does, a constant proportion of blade area to disk,  and a uniform pattern of blade, the determination of the diameter for a  given set of conditions may, as a rule, be a complete solution of the  problem of the design of a screw, but these assumptions do not cover all  the necessities of actual practice, which make it extremely desirable to  know something about the influence or efficiency of various proportions of  blade area to disk, and of the form or distribution of a given area.    During the discussion which followed, Mr. John said that, both as regarded  the mercantile marine and the Royal Navy, there were few data to work upon,  but few ships having been built with twin screws. Mr. Linnington's  proportions of pitch to diameter of 1.2 to 1.34 was not invariably adhered  to. He mentioned a couple of small twin screw vessels where the proportion  of pitch to diameter came nearly to 1.5, and he remembered a few years ago  the propellers in one of these vessels being changed and the pitch  increased, the result being a very considerable improvement. He believed  they might go with quick running twin screw engines to a larger proportion  of pitch to diameter than they could with a single screw. He might instance  the change in the Iris. She was first engined with the pitch equal to the  diameter, and she gained two knots or thereabout when the diameter was  reduced 2 ft. and the pitch increased 2 ft.    Admiral De Horsey said that he tried experiments with the single screw in  the Aurora. She had a feathering serew, and when the sails were used to  assist, they commonly altered the pitch of the screw according to the  strength of the wind. The screw could be altered while it was revolving,  and as the wind freshened they coarsened the pitch, and when they wanted to  stop the engines they coarsened the pitch so as to bring the screw right  fore and aft, so that they never altered the way of the ship in changing  from steam to sail alone. The reason why twin screws had been adopted in  the navy was that if one was damaged there was the other still available.  But it gave them a still further advantage, as it enabled them to have a  fore and aft bulkhead, which with a single screw was difficult. The  mercantile marine had not as yet looked favorably on twin screws. Their  finest and fastest ships were single screws, probably because, in very bad  weather, the single screw was better.    Mr. Spyer said that in designing propellers for ships of war, they were  obliged to attempt to obtain the highest possible speed, and that was not  necessarily coincident with a propeller of maximum efficiency. On the other  hand, for mercantile purposes, coal consumption was obviously of paramount  importance, and the speed of any particular vessel must be obtained with  the smallest possible amount of indicated horse power, and a propeller of  maximum efficiency. Regarding the position of the propellers in a small  pinnace, the propellers were shifted six or seven inches further out, and  with about ten per cent. less indicated horse power she obtained three  tenths of a knot more speed.    Mr. Barnaby asked Mr. Linnington whether, in designing twin screws for a  vessel of 8,000 i.h.p., he would make each screw, which would have to take  4,000 i.h.p., of the same diameter as a screw for a single ship of 4,000  i.h.p., of the same speed. Unfortunately in high speed vessels, from one  point of view, the faster they went for a given power the smaller the  diameter of the screw had to be, and the larger the pitch, so that in very  high speed twin screw vessels the ratio of pitch to diameter would be found  to come out very great indeed. In a twin screw torpedo boat, to be tried  shortly, they had a ratio as high as 1.64. In the case of the Inflexible it  was found, owing possibly to the position of the screw, that the whole of  the plates immediately over the screws were damaged. Mr. Beckett Hill had  been using, during the past three or four years, the twin screw steamers  the Ludgate Hill, Richmond Hill, and Tower Hill. These were all over 4,000  tons register, and indicated, when at work at full speed, 2,500 h.p. Before  he and his friends built these steamers, they built some very large tug  boats on the twin screw principle. At the present moment, four of the  fastest steamers building for the Atlantic service were to have twin  screws. The great obstacle to the extension of the twin screw in the  mercantile navy had been the fear that the projection of these screws would  make the vessels very difficult to handle, but he had found no such  difficulties. He had found it an advantage to put the point of the  propeller as near the deadwood as he could, without actually touching it,  and in the large steamers, as well as in the tugs, the distance was a few  inches. As to the point of safety, he thought it a great advantage to have  twin screws, and on two occasions twin screw vessels had met with accidents  which, but for the twin screws, would have necessitated their putting back  to New York for repairs. The Richmond Hill, on one occasion, met with an  accident to her machinery two days after leaving New York; but she was able  to come on with the second set of engines, and was only one day late in the  passage. No difficulty had been found in the docking and undocking of these  vessels, either in London or Liverpool, and while with single screw vessels  they had sometimes to employ one or two dock boats to dock and undock them,  they never had to do so with the twin screw vessels. These vessels were 400  ft. long, with 48 ft. breadth of beam--a very large size to handle in a  river like the Thames. He noticed in the paper a propeller with a diameter  of 15 ft. 6 in. to indicate 11,110 h.p., so that a great Atlantic steamer,  which should indicate 11,000 or 12,000 h.p., and have a beam of about  65ft., would have her screws very well protected.    Mr. White said that as soon as it was found that with twin screws they lost  nothing in efficiency, ship owners generally were contemplating their  adoption, an admirable example of which had been set in the vessels of the  Hill line. In adopting twin screws, the question whether they should  overlap was one that deserved very serious consideration, and it was  interesting to know, from experience gained by the vessels of the Hill  line, that there was no difficulty in the way of the projection of the  screws. With a moderate power, and with vessels of considerable size, the  screws were well sheltered: but in the large ships which were contemplated,  where there must necessarily be larger screws, this might be different, and  become a difficulty.    Mr. Linnington, in reply, said there was no reason to think that the twin  screw at sea might not be as satisfactory, in comparison with the single  screw, as it appeared in smooth water. As a matter of fact, one of the  great advantages of twin screws was that at sea the condition of weather  which would bring the single screw out of the water, and make it extremely  inefficient, would have no appreciable effect on the twin screws. In  vessels of deep draught especially, they were well immersed, and they were  really more efficient at sea than in smooth water. In ships of full form,  the longitudinal position of the screws was of importance; but in the ships  referred to in this table the run was very fine, and the screws were well  covered by the hull. He did not think, in such a case, any small difference  in longitudinal position would affect the performance. If any alteration  were made, it would probably be better to put the screws farther off. When  the rudder was hard over, the blades of the screw should be about a foot  clear of the rudder.--_Industries_.           *       *       *       *       *          RECENT ADVANCES IN SEWING MACHINERY.
