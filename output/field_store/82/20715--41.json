Who cares? Who is responsible? No one. Is there a  remedy? Ah! that is a question that requires time. Time--always time!  Time for the politician, and time for the starving ones! Half the  world thinks, whilst half the world dies; and the cause of it all is  time--too much, a damned sight too much--time!    But Kelson and Curtis could not grumble. They had their room--bare,  dirty and well-ventilated--for next to nothing. Fifty cents a week!  And they could furnish it as they pleased. Fancy that! What a  privilege! They were glad of it all the same--glad of it in preference  to the streets; and probably, when asleep, they thought of it as home.  But on leaving Hamar's, that evening, they had fully resolved to  convert their little room into a cemetery. What else could they do?  What can any one do who has no money and no prospect of getting any,  and who has reached the pitch of acute hunger? He has passed the stage  of wanting work, because, if work were offered to him, he would not be  in a fit state to do it--he would be too weak. Too weak to work! What  a phenomenon! Yes--to all those who have never missed a day's meals.  To others--no! They can understand--and understand only too well--the  really poor who have long ceased to eat, cannot work--they are beyond  it.    When Curtis and Kelson staggered down the stairs of the house where  Hamar lodged, they realized that unless something turned up pretty  soon, it would be too late--they would be past the stage of caring for  anything--too feeble to do anything but lie on the ground and pray  that death would come quickly.    \"Home?\" Kelson inquired, as they emerged on to the pavement.    \"Hell!\" Curtis answered, and Kelson, taking it for granted that the  terms were synonymous, at once headed for their garret.    \"Don't walk so confoundedly fast,\" Curtis gasped; \"this pain in my  side is like a hundred stitches rolled in one. It fairly doubles me  up. Ease down a bit, for heaven's sake!\"    Kelson obeyed, and presently came to a dead halt before a  dingy-looking restaurant. Both men leaned against the window and gazed  wolfishly at the food. A warm, foetid rush of air from under the  grating at their feet tickled their nostrils and mocked their hunger  with a mockery past endurance. Arranged on the window-sill was a  miscellaneous collection of very smeary plates and dishes, containing  an even more miscellaneous collection of food. A half-consumed ham,  with more than a mere suspicion of dirt on its yellowish-white fat;  some concoction in a bowl that might have been brawn made from some  peculiarly liverish pig, or--from one of the many homeless mongrels  that roam the streets at night; a pile of noxious-looking mussels,  side by side with a glistening mass of particularly yellow whelks; a  round of what purported to be beef--very fat and very underdone; some  black shiny sausages, and a score or so of luridly red polonies. A  similar assortment was to be seen on the counter behind which lolled  an anaemic girl, in a dirty cotton blouse, and a much soiled sky-blue  skirt.    A month ago such an exhibition would have been an offence in the  fastidious eyes of Messrs. Kelson and Curtis; but now it was  otherwise. Their stomachs would have refused nothing short of garbage.    \"Matt!\" Curtis's hands had left off clutching at his belt and were now  hanging by his side; the fingers twitching to and fro in a manner that  fascinated Kelson. \"Matt! Is there any logic in our starving?\"    \"None, excepting that we haven't a cent between us!\" Kelson rejoined.    \"I know that,\" Curtis went on slowly, \"but--I mean--why should we  starve when all this grub is within two inches of us! It's  unreasonable--it's intolerable.\"    \"Doesn't the smell of it satisfy you?\" Kelson replied, attempting to  force a smile, and failing dismally.    \"D--n the smell!\" Curtis cried. \"It's the ham I want. I'd give my soul  for a good munch at it. And just look at that tea, too! Don't you see  it steaming over there? What wouldn't I give for just one cup! Ten  minutes more and it may be too late. The pain will come on again--and  it will be very doubtful if I shall ever get home. I'm close on the  stage when one begins to digest one's own stomach. Curse it! I won't  starve any longer! Matt! she's in there all by herself!\"    \"So I've been thinking,\" Kelson murmured, glancing uneasily up and  down the street. \"Still she's a girl, Ed!\"    \"That's just it!\" Curtis whispered; \"it is because she is a girl. If  she were a man, in our present condition we shouldn't stand a chance.  Come! It's this or dying in the gutters. It's our one and only chance.  Let's go in--have a feed--take what we can and make a bolt for it. If  she tries to stop us we can settle her right enough.\"    \"Without being too rough! There's no need to be too rough with her,  Ed.\"    \"I shouldn't stick at much!\" Curtis answered. \"Occasions like these  don't admit of chivalry. Come along! It's the ham I'm after.\"    Curtis shuffled forward as he spoke, and the next moment Kelson and he  were standing in front of the counter.    The girl eyed Curtis very dubiously and it is more than likely would  have refused to serve him had he been alone. But her expression  changed on looking at Kelson. Kelson was one of those individuals who  seldom fail to meet with the approval of women--there was a something  in him they liked. Probably neither he nor they could have defined  that something; but there it was, and it came in extremely handy now.    \"What do you want?\" she inquired shortly.    \"Ham! Give me some of that ham over there, miss, and a cup of tea!  Bread too!\" Curtis cried eagerly. \"Do you know what it is to have a  twist on, miss? I have one on now--so please give us a full  twenty-five cents' worth.\"    Kelson said nothing, but his eyes glistened, and the girl wondered as  she passed him the polonies.    Both men ate as they had never eaten before, and as they would not have  eaten now had they paid any attention to the advice of hunger experts.  However, they survived, and when they could eat no more they leaned  back in their chairs to enjoy the sensation of returning--albeit,  slowly returning--strength.    Curtis was the first to make a move. \"Matt,\" he murmured, \"we've about  sat our sit. We'd better be off. You go and say a few nice words to  the girl and make pretence of paying. I'll secure the ham--there's  still a good bit left--and anything else I can grab. The moment I do  this, throw these chairs on the ground so that the girl will fall over  them when she makes a dash for me, which she is certain to do. We will  then head straight away for 216th Street. Don't look so scared or she  will think there is something up. She has never taken her eyes off you  since we sat down!\"    \"She's rather a nice girl!\" Kelson said. \"I wish I didn't look quite  such a blackguard--and--I wish I hadn't to be quite such a blackguard.  Who'll pay for all this? Will she?\"    \"We shan't, anyway,\" Curtis sneered. \"Come, this is no time to be  sentimental. It was a question of life and death with us, and we've  only done what any one else would do in our circumstances. The girl  won't lose much! Are you ready?\"    Curtis rose, and Kelson, who was accustomed to obey him, reluctantly  followed suit. A look almost suggestive of fear came into the girl's  eyes as they encountered those of Curtis, and she shot a swift glance  at an inner door. Then Kelson spoke, and as she turned her head  towards him, her lips parted in a sort of smile.    \"Nice night, miss, isn't it?\" Kelson said, halting half-way between  the counter and the chairs. \"Aren't you a bit lonely here all by  yourself?\"    \"Sometimes,\" the girl laughed. \"But my mother's in the room there,\"  and she nodded in the direction of the closed door. \"And one can't be  dull when she's about. She's that there active as a rule, there's no  keeping her quiet--only just at present\"--here she glanced  apprehensively at Curtis--\"she's recovering from ague. Gets it every  year about this time. Your friend seems to have kind of taken a fancy  to our ham!\"    Kelson looked at Curtis and his heart thumped. Curtis's right hand was  getting ready to spring at the ham, whilst his left was creeping  stealthily along the counter in the direction of a loaf of bread.  Kelson slowly realized that an acute crisis in both their lives was at  hand, and that it depended on him how it would end. He had never  thought it possible to feel as mean as he felt now. Besides, his  natural sympathy with women tempted him to stand by the girl and  prevent Curtis from robbing her. He was still deliberating, when he  saw two long dark objects, with lightning rapidity, swoop down on the  plates and dishes. There was a loud clatter, and the next moment the  whole place seemed alive with movement.    A voice which in his confusion he did not recognize at once  shouted--and seemingly from far away--\"Quick, you fool, quick! Fling  down the chairs and grab those sausages!\" Whilst from close beside  him--almost, he fancied, in his ears--came a wild shriek of \"Mother!  Mother! We are being robbed!\"    Had the girl appealed to him to help her it is more than likely that  Kelson, who was even yet undecided what course to adopt, would have  offered her his aid; but the instant she acted on the defensive his  mind was made up; a mad spirit of self-preservation swept over  him--and dashing the chairs on the ground at her feet, he seized the  sausages, and flew after Curtis.    Ten minutes later, Curtis and Kelson, their arms full of spoil,  clambered up the staircase of their lodgings, and reeled into their  room.    \"Look!\" Curtis gasped, sinking into the chair. \"Look and see if we are  followed!\"    \"There's no one about!\" Kelson whispered, peering cautiously out of  the window. \"Not a soul!

Choose an thou  wilt a judge, and let us dispute before him concerning the rightful  ownership of wealth and rank. If thou succeedest in showing that any one  of these things is the true property of mortal man, I freely grant those  things to be thine which thou claimest. When nature brought thee forth  out of thy mother's womb, I took thee, naked and destitute as thou wast,  I cherished thee with my substance, and, in the partiality of my favour  for thee, I brought thee up somewhat too indulgently, and this it is  which now makes thee rebellious against me. I surrounded thee with a  royal abundance of all those things that are in my power. Now it is my  pleasure to draw back my hand. Thou hast reason to thank me for the use  of what was not thine own; thou hast no right to complain, as if thou  hadst lost what was wholly thine. Why, then, dost bemoan thyself? I have  done thee no violence. Wealth, honour, and all such things are placed  under my control. My handmaidens know their mistress; with me they come,  and at my going they depart. I might boldly affirm that if those things  the loss of which thou lamentest had been thine, thou couldst never have  lost them. Am I alone to be forbidden to do what I will with my own?  Unrebuked, the skies now reveal the brightness of day, now shroud the  daylight in the darkness of night; the year may now engarland the face  of the earth with flowers and fruits, now disfigure it with storms and  cold. The sea is permitted to invite with smooth and tranquil surface  to-day, to-morrow to roughen with wave and storm. Shall man's insatiate  greed bind _me_ to a constancy foreign to my character? This is my art,  this the game I never cease to play. I turn the wheel that spins. I  delight to see the high come down and the low ascend. Mount up, if thou  wilt, but only on condition that thou wilt not think it a hardship to  come down when the rules of my game require it. Wert thou ignorant of my  character? Didst not know how Croesus, King of the Lydians, erstwhile  the dreaded rival of Cyrus, was afterwards pitiably consigned to the  flame of the pyre, and only saved by a shower sent from heaven? Has it  'scaped thee how Paullus paid a meed of pious tears to the misfortunes  of King Perseus, his prisoner? What else do tragedies make such woeful  outcry over save the overthrow of kingdoms by the indiscriminate strokes  of Fortune? Didst thou not learn in thy childhood how there stand at the  threshold of Zeus 'two jars,' 'the one full of blessings, the other of  calamities'? How if thou hast drawn over-liberally from the good jar?  What if not even now have I departed wholly from thee? What if this very  mutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better things? But listen  now, and cease to let thy heart consume away with fretfulness, nor  expect to live on thine own terms in a realm that is common to all.'        SONG II.    MAN'S COVETOUSNESS.          What though Plenty pour her gifts        With a lavish hand,      Numberless as are the stars,        Countless as the sand,      Will the race of man, content,      Cease to murmur and lament?        Nay, though God, all-bounteous, give        Gold at man's desire--      Honours, rank, and fame--content        Not a whit is nigher;      But an all-devouring greed      Yawns with ever-widening need.        Then what bounds can e'er restrain        This wild lust of having,      When with each new bounty fed        Grows the frantic craving?      He is never rich whose fear      Sees grim Want forever near.        III.      'If Fortune should plead thus against thee, assuredly thou wouldst not  have one word to offer in reply; or, if thou canst find any  justification of thy complainings, thou must show what it is. I will  give thee space to speak.'    Then said I: 'Verily, thy pleas are plausible--yea, steeped in the  honeyed sweetness of music and rhetoric. But their charm lasts only  while they are sounding in the ear; the sense of his misfortunes lies  deeper in the heart of the wretched. So, when the sound ceases to  vibrate upon the air, the heart's indwelling sorrow is felt with renewed  bitterness.'    Then said she: 'It is indeed as thou sayest, for we have not yet come to  the curing of thy sickness; as yet these are but lenitives conducing to  the treatment of a malady hitherto obstinate. The remedies which go deep  I will apply in due season. Nevertheless, to deprecate thy  determination to be thought wretched, I ask thee, Hast thou forgotten  the extent and bounds of thy felicity? I say nothing of how, when  orphaned and desolate, thou wast taken into the care of illustrious men;  how thou wast chosen for alliance with the highest in the state--and  even before thou wert bound to their house by marriage, wert already  dear to their love--which is the most precious of all ties. Did not all  pronounce thee most happy in the virtues of thy wife, the splendid  honours of her father, and the blessing of male issue? I pass over--for  I care not to speak of blessings in which others also have shared--the  distinctions often denied to age which thou enjoyedst in thy youth. I  choose rather to come to the unparalleled culmination of thy good  fortune. If the fruition of any earthly success has weight in the scale  of happiness, can the memory of that splendour be swept away by any  rising flood of troubles? That day when thou didst see thy two sons ride  forth from home joint consuls, followed by a train of senators, and  welcomed by the good-will of the people; when these two sat in curule  chairs in the Senate-house, and thou by thy panegyric on the king didst  earn the fame of eloquence and ability; when in the Circus, seated  between the two consuls, thou didst glut the multitude thronging around  with the triumphal largesses for which they looked--methinks thou didst  cozen Fortune while she caressed thee, and made thee her darling. Thou  didst bear off a boon which she had never before granted to any private  person. Art thou, then, minded to cast up a reckoning with Fortune? Now  for the first time she has turned a jealous glance upon thee. If thou  compare the extent and bounds of thy blessings and misfortunes, thou  canst not deny that thou art still fortunate. Or if thou esteem not  thyself favoured by Fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity hath  departed, deem not thyself wretched, since what thou now believest to be  calamitous passeth also. What! art thou but now come suddenly and a  stranger to the scene of this life? Thinkest thou there is any stability  in human affairs, when man himself vanishes away in the swift course of  time? It is true that there is little trust that the gifts of chance  will abide; yet the last day of life is in a manner the death of all  remaining Fortune. What difference, then, thinkest thou, is there,  whether thou leavest her by dying, or she leave thee by fleeing away?'        SONG III.    ALL PASSES.          When, in rosy chariot drawn,      Phoebus 'gins to light the dawn,      By his flaming beams assailed,      Every glimmering star is paled.      When the grove, by Zephyrs fed,      With rose-blossom blushes red;--      Doth rude Auster breathe thereon,      Bare it stands, its glory gone.      Smooth and tranquil lies the deep      While the winds are hushed in sleep.      Soon, when angry tempests lash,      Wild and high the billows dash.      Thus if Nature's changing face      Holds not still a moment's space,      Fleeting deem man's fortunes; deem      Bliss as transient as a dream.      One law only standeth fast:      Things created may not last.        IV.      Then said I: 'True are thine admonishings, thou nurse of all excellence;  nor can I deny the wonder of my fortune's swift career. Yet it is this  which chafes me the more cruelly in the recalling. For truly in adverse  fortune the worst sting of misery is to _have been_ happy.'    'Well,' said she, 'if thou art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief,  thou canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances. If it is the  felicity which Fortune gives that moves thee--mere name though it  be--come reckon up with me how rich thou art in the number and  weightiness of thy blessings. Then if, by the blessing of Providence,  thou hast still preserved unto thee safe and inviolate that which,  howsoever thou mightest reckon thy fortune, thou wouldst have thought  thy most precious possession, what right hast thou to talk of  ill-fortune whilst keeping all Fortune's better gifts? Yet Symmachus,  thy wife's father--a man whose splendid character does honour to the  human race--is safe and unharmed; and while he bewails thy wrongs, this  rare nature, in whom wisdom and virtue are so nobly blended, is himself  out of danger--a boon thou wouldst have been quick to purchase at the  price of life itself. Thy wife yet lives, with her gentle disposition,  her peerless modesty and virtue--this the epitome of all her graces,  that she is the true daughter of her sire--she lives, I say, and for thy  sake only preserves the breath of life, though she loathes it, and pines  away in grief and tears for thy absence, wherein, if in naught else, I  would allow some marring of thy felicity. What shall I say of thy sons  and their consular dignity--how in them, so far as may be in youths of  their age, the example of their father's and grandfather's character  shines out? Since, then, the chief care of mortal man is to preserve his  life, how happy art thou, couldst thou but recognise thy blessings, who  possessest even now what no one doubts to be dearer than life!  Wherefore, now dry thy tears. Fortune's hate hath not involved all thy  dear ones; the stress of the storm that has assailed thee is not beyond  measure intolerable, since there are anchors still holding firm which  suffer thee not to lack either consolation in the present or hope for  the future.'
