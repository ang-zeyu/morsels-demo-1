And as there is Nothing outside of THE ALL, in  Reality, then any and all such finite things must be as Nothing in  Reality. Now do not become befogged, nor frightened--we are not trying  to lead you into the Christian Science field under cover of Hermetic  Philosophy. There is a Reconciliation of this apparently contradictory  state of affairs. Be patient, we will reach it in time.    We see around us that which is called \"Matter,\" which forms the physical  foundation for all forms. Is THE ALL merely Matter? Not at all! Matter  cannot manifest Life or Mind, and as Life and Mind are manifested in the  Universe, THE ALL cannot be Matter, for nothing rises higher than its  own source--nothing is ever manifested in an effect that is not in the  cause--nothing is evolved as a consequent that is not involved as an  antecedent. And then Modern Science informs us that there is really no  such thing as Matter--that what we call Matter is merely \"interrupted  energy or force,\" that is, energy or force at a low rate of vibration.  As a recent writer has said \"Matter has melted into Mystery.\" Even  Material Science has abandoned the theory of Matter, and now rests on  the basis of \"Energy.\"    Then is THE ALL mere Energy or Force? Not Energy or Force as the  materialists use the terms, for their energy and force are blind,  mechanical things, devoid of Life or Mind. Life and Mind can never  evolve from blind Energy or Force, for the reason given a moment ago:  \"Nothing can rise higher than its source--nothing is evolved unless it  is involved--nothing manifests in the effect, unless it is in the cause.  \" And so THE ALL cannot be mere Energy or Force, for, if it were, then  there would be no such things as Life and Mind in existence, and we know  better than that, for we are Alive and using Mind to consider this very  question, and so are those who claim that Energy or Force is Everything.    What is there then higher than Matter or Energy that we know to be  existent in the Universe? LIFE AND MIND! Life and Mind in all their  varying degrees of unfoldment! \"Then,\" you ask, \"do you mean to tell us  that THE ALL is LIFE and MIND?\" Yes! and No! is our answer. If you mean  Life and Mind as we poor petty mortals know them, we say No! THE ALL is  not that! \"But what kind of Life and Mind do you mean?\" you ask.    The answer is \"LIVING MIND,\" as far above that which mortals know by  those words, as Life and Mind are higher than mechanical forces, or  matter--INFINITE LIVING MIND as compared to finite \"Life and Mind.\" We  mean that which the illumined souls mean when they reverently pronounce  the word: \"SPIRIT!\"    \"THE ALL\" is Infinite Living Mind--the Illumined call it SPIRIT!        CHAPTER V    THE MENTAL UNIVERSE        \"The Universe is Mental--held in the Mind of THE      ALL.\"--The Kybalion.    THE ALL is SPIRIT! But what is Spirit? This question cannot be answered,  for the reason that its definition is practically that of THE ALL, which  cannot be explained or defined. Spirit is simply a name that men give to  the highest conception of Infinite Living Mind--it means \"the Real  Essence\"--it means Living Mind, as much superior to Life and Mind as we  know them, as the latter are superior to mechanical Energy and Matter.  Spirit transcends our understanding, and we use the term merely that we  may think or speak of THE ALL. For the purposes of thought and  understanding, we are justified in thinking of Spirit as Infinite Living  Mind, at the same time acknowledging that we cannot fully understand it.  We must either do this or stop thinking of the matter at all.    Let us now proceed to a consideration of the nature of the Universe, as  a whole and in its parts. What is the Universe? We have seen that there  can be nothing outside of THE ALL. Then is the Universe THE ALL? No,  this cannot be, because the Universe seems to be made up of MANY, and is  constantly changing, and in other ways it does not measure up to the  ideas that we are compelled to accept regarding THE ALL, as stated in  our last lesson. Then if the Universe be not THE ALL, then it must be  Nothing--such is the inevitable conclusion of the mind at first thought.  But this will not satisfy the question, for we are sensible of the  existence of the Universe. Then if the Universe is neither THE ALL, nor  Nothing, what Can it be? Let us examine this question.    If the Universe exists at all, or seems to exist, it must proceed in  some way from THE ALL--it must be a creation of THE ALL. But as  something can never come from nothing, from what could THE ALL have  created it. Some philosophers have answered this question by saying that  THE ALL created the Universe from ITSELF--that is, from the being and  substance of THE ALL. But this will not do, for THE ALL cannot be  subtracted from, nor divided, as we have seen, and then again if this be  so, would not each particle in the Universe be aware of its being THE  ALL--THE ALL could not lose its knowledge of itself, nor actually BECOME  an atom, or blind force, or lowly living thing. Some men, indeed,  realizing that THE ALL is indeed ALL, and also recognizing that they,  the men, existed, have jumped to the conclusion that they and THE ALL  were identical, and they have filled the air with shouts of \"I AM GOD,\"  to the amusement of the multitude and the sorrow of sages. The claim of  the corpuscle that: \"I am Man!\" would be modest in comparison.    But, what indeed is the Universe, if it be not THE ALL, not yet created  by THE ALL having separated itself into fragments? What else can it be--  of what else can it be made? This is the great question. Let us examine  it carefully. We find here that the \"Principle of Correspondence\" (see  Lesson I.) comes to our aid here. The old Hermetic axiom, \"As above so  below,\" may be pressed into service at this point. Let us endeavor to  get a glimpse of the workings on higher planes by examining those on our  own. The Principle of Correspondence must apply to this as well as to  other problems.    Let us see! On his own plane of being, how does Man create? Well, first,  he may create by making something out of outside materials. But this  will not do, for there are no materials outside of THE ALL with which it  may create. Well, then, secondly, Man pro-creates or reproduces his kind  by the process of begetting, which is self-multiplication accomplished  by transferring a portion of his substance to his offspring. But this  will not do, because THE ALL cannot transfer or subtract a portion of  itself, nor can it reproduce or multiply itself--in the first place  there would be a taking away, and in the second case a multiplication or  addition to THE ALL, both thoughts being an absurdity. Is there no third  way in which MAN creates? Yes, there is--he CREATES MENTALLY! And in so  doing he uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself, and  yet his Spirit pervades the Mental Creation.    Following the Principle of Correspondence, we are justified in  considering that THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin  to the process whereby Man creates Mental Images. And, here is where the  report of Reason tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as  shown by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the  Wise Men. Such was the Teaching of Hermes.    THE ALL can create in no other way except mentally, without either using  material (and there is none to use), or else reproducing itself (which  is also impossible). There is no escape from this conclusion of the  Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the highest teachings of the  Illumined. Just as you, student, may create a Universe of your own in  your mentality, so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality.  But your Universe is the mental creation of a Finite Mind, whereas that  of THE ALL is the creation of an Infinite. The two are similar in kind,  but infinitely different in degree. We shall examine more closely into  the process of creation and manifestation as we proceed. But this is the  point to fix in your minds at this stage: THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT  CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL CREATION OF THE ALL. Verily indeed, ALL IS MIND!        \"THE ALL creates in its Infinite Mind countless Universes,      which exist for aeons of Time--and yet, to THE ALL, the      creation, development, decline and death of a million Universes      is as the time of the twinkling of an eye.\"--The Kybalion.        \"The Infinite Mind of THE ALL is the womb of Universes.\"--The      Kybalion.    The Principle of Gender (see Lesson I. and other lessons to follow) is  manifested on all planes of life, material mental and spiritual. But,  as we have said before, \"Gender\" does not mean \"Sex\" sex is merely a  material manifestation of gender. \"Gender\" means \"relating to generation  or creation.\" And whenever anything is generated or created, on any  plane, the Principle of Gender must be manifested. And this is true even  in the creation of Universes.    Now do not jump to the conclusion that we are teaching that there is a  male and female God, or Creator. That idea is merely a distortion of the  ancient teachings on the subject. The true teaching is that THE ALL, in  itself, is above Gender, as it is above every other Law, including those  of Time and Space. It is the Law, from which the Laws proceed, and it is  not subject to them. But when THE ALL manifests on the plane of  generation or creation, then it acts according to Law and Principle, for  it is moving on a lower plane of Being. And consequently it manifests  the Principle of Gender, in its Masculine and Feminine aspects, on the  Mental Plane, of course.    This idea may seem startling to some of you who hear it for the first  time, but you have all really passively accepted it in your everyday  conceptions.

Thus you will obtain the glory of the  whole world, and obscurity will fly away from you.\"    This sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and  things on earth, and asserts the possibility of gaining, not merely a  theoretical, but also a practical, knowledge of the essential  characters of all things. Moreover, the sentence implies that this  fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature, using as  guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things  above and things beneath.    The alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme: follow nature;  provided you never lose the clue, which is simplicity and similarity.    The author of _The Only Way_ (1677) beseeches his readers \"to enlist  under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience  to the teaching of nature ... in short, the method which nature  herself pursues in the bowels of the earth.\"    The alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written  directions. When one of them has said all he can say, he adds--\"The  question is whether even this book will convey any information to one  before whom the writings of the Sages and the open book of Nature are  exhibited in vain.\" Another tells his readers the only thing for them  is \"to beseech God to give you the real philosophical temper, and to  open your eyes to the facts of nature; thus alone will you reach the  coveted goal.\"    \"Follow nature\" is sound advice. But, nature was to be followed with  eyes closed save to one vision, and the vision was to be seen before  the following began.    The alchemists' general conception of nature led them to assign to  every substance a condition or state natural to it, and wherein alone  it could be said to be as it was designed to be. Each substance, they  taught, could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent, or  non-natural, means, and any substance which had been driven from its  natural condition by violence was ready, and even eager, to return to  the condition consonant with its nature.    Thus Norton, in his _Ordinal of Alchemy_, says: \"Metals are generated  in the earth, for above ground they are subject to rust; hence above  ground is the place of corruption of metals, and of their gradual  destruction. The cause which we assign to this fact is that above  ground they are not in their proper element, and an unnatural position  is destructive to natural objects, as we see, for instance, that  fishes die when they are taken out of the water; and as it is natural  for men, beasts, and birds to live in the air, so stones and metals  are naturally generated under the earth.\"    In his _New Pearl of Great Price_ (16th century), Bonus says:--\"The  object of Nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the  form which properly belongs to it; and this is also the design of our  Art.\"    This view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the  substances wherewith experiments were performed. It supposed that man  could act as a guide, to bring back to its natural condition a  substance which had been removed from that condition, either by  violent processes of nature, or by man's device. The alchemist  regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural  condition of each substance he dealt with. He thought he could say,  \"this substance ought to be thus, or thus,\" \"that substance is  constrained, thwarted, hindered from becoming what nature meant it to  be.\"    In Ben Jonson's play called _The Alchemist_, Subtle (who is the  alchemist of the play) says, \" ... metals would be gold if they had  time.\"    The alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material  things, he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices  of these things. He thought himself able to recall the erring metal to  the path of metalline virtue, to lead the extravagant mineral back to  the moral home-life from which it had been seduced, to show the  doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking, and to  help it to find the unrealised object of its search. The alchemist  acted as a sort of conscience to the metals, minerals, salts, and  other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory. He  treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat  refractory patient. \"I know what you want better than you do,\" he  seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining, separating,  joining and subliming.    But the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment.  Sometimes the patient rebelled. For instance, Michael Sendivogius, in  his tract, _The New Chemical Light drawn from the Fountain of Nature  and of Manual Experience_ (17th century), recounts _a dialogue between  Mercury, the Alchemist, and Nature_.    \"On a certain bright morning a number of Alchemists met together in a  meadow, and consulted as to the best way of preparing the  Philosopher's Stone.... Most of them agreed that Mercury was the first  substance. Others said, no, it was sulphur, or something else.... Just  as the dispute began to run high, there arose a violent wind, which  dispersed the Alchemists into all the different countries of the  world; and as they had arrived at no conclusion, each one went on  seeking the Philosopher's Stone in his own old way, this one expecting  to find it in one substance, and that in another, so that the search  has continued without intermission even unto this day. One of them,  however, had at least got the idea into his head that Mercury was the  substance of the Stone, and determined to concentrate all his efforts  on the chemical preparation of Mercury.... He took common Mercury and  began to work with it. He placed it in a glass vessel over the fire,  when it, of course, evaporated. So in his ignorance he struck his  wife, and said: 'No one but you has entered my laboratory; you must  have taken my Mercury out of the vessel.' The woman, with tears,  protested her innocence. The Alchemist put some more Mercury into the  vessel.... The Mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous  steam. Then the Alchemist was full of joy, because he remembered that  the first substance of the Stone is described by the Sages as  volatile; and he thought that now at last he _must_ be on the right  track. He now began to subject the Mercury to all sorts of chemical  processes, to sublime it, and to calcine it with all manner of things,  with salts, sulphur, metals, minerals, blood, hair, aqua fortis,  herbs, urine, and vinegar.... Everything he could think of was tried;  but without producing the desired effect.\" The Alchemist then  despaired; after a dream, wherein an old man came and talked with him  about the \"Mercury of the Sages,\" the Alchemist thought he would charm  the Mercury, and so he used a form of incantation. The Mercury  suddenly began to speak, and asked the Alchemist why he had troubled  him so much, and so on. The Alchemist replied, and questioned the  Mercury. The Mercury makes fun of the philosopher. Then the Alchemist  again torments the Mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible  things. At last Mercury calls in the aid of Nature, who soundly rates  the philosopher, tells him he is grossly ignorant, and ends by saying:  \"The best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the king's  officers, who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy.\"    As long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon  the world was framed, that it was possible for them to follow exactly  \"the road which was followed by the Great Architect of the Universe in  the creation of the world,\" a real knowledge of natural events was  impossible; for every attempt to penetrate nature's secrets  presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which  was to be investigated. But genuine knowledge begins when the  investigator admits that he must learn of nature, not nature of him.  It might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of  nature that \"his foible was omniscience\"; and omniscience negatives  the attainment of knowledge.    The alchemical notion of a natural state as proper to each substance  was vigorously combated by the Honourable Robert Boyle (born 1626,  died 1691), a man of singularly clear and penetrative intellect. In _A  Paradox of the Natural and Supernatural States of Bodies, Especially  of the Air_, Boyle says:--\"I know that not only in living, but even in  inanimate, bodies, of which alone I here discourse, men have  universally admitted the famous distinction between the natural and  preternatural, or violent state of bodies, and do daily, without the  least scruple, found upon it hypotheses and ratiocinations, as if it  were most certain that what they call nature had purposely formed  bodies in such a determinate state, and were always watchful that they  should not by any external violence be put out of it. But  notwithstanding so general a consent of men in this point, I confess,  I cannot yet be satisfied about it in the sense wherein it is wont to  be taken. It is not, that I believe, that there is no sense in which,  or in the account upon which, a body may he said to be in its natural  state; but that I think the common distinction of a natural and  violent state of bodies has not been clearly explained and  considerately settled, and both is not well grounded, and is  oftentimes ill applied. For when I consider that whatever state a body  be put into, or kept in, it obtains or retains that state, assenting  to the catholic laws of nature, I cannot think it fit to deny that in  this sense the body proposed is in a natural state; but then, upon the  same ground, it will he hard to deny but that those bodies which are  said to be in a violent state may also be in a natural one,"]]]
