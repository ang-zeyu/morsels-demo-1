But the glass of wine--can anything be more easy? One would think  not--but if you take notice next time you empty a gallon with a friend,  you will see that, sixteen to one, he makes the most convulsive efforts  to do with ease what a person would naturally suppose was the easiest  thing in the world. Do you see, in the first place, how hard he grasps  the decanter, leaving the misty marks of five hot fingers on the  glittering crystal, which ought to be pure as Cornelia's fame? Then  remark at what an acute angle he holds his right elbow as if he were  meditating an assault on his neighbour's ribs; then see how he claps the  bottle down again as if his object were to shake the pure ichor, and  make it muddy as his own brains. Mark how the animal seizes his  glass,--by heavens he will break it into a thousand fragments! See how  he bows his lubberly head to meet half way the glorious cargo; how he  slobbers the beverage over his unmeaning gullet, and chucks down the  glass so as almost to break its stem after he has emptied it of its  contents as if they had been jalap or castor-oil! Call you that taking a  glass of wine? Sir, it is putting wine into your gullet as you would put  small beer into a barrel,--but it is not--oh, no! it is not taking, so  as to enjoy, a glass of red, rich port, or glowing, warm, tinted,  beautiful caveza!    A newly married couple are invited to a wedding dinner. Though the lady,  perhaps, has run off with a person below her in rank and station, see  when they enter the room, how differently they behave.--How gracefully  she waves her head in the fine recover from the withdrawing curtsy, and  beautifully extends her hand to the bald-pated individual grinning to  her on the rug! While the poor spoon, her husband, looks on, with the  white of his eyes turned up as if he were sea-sick, and his hands dangle  dangle on his thighs as if he were trying to lift his own legs. See how  he ducks to the lady of the house, and simpers across the fire-place to  his wife, who, by this time is giving a most spirited account of the  state of the roads, and the civility of the postilions near the Borders.    Is a man little? Let him always, if possible, stoop. We are sometimes  tempted to lay sprawling in the mud fellows of from five feet to five  feet eight, who carry the back of their heads on the extreme summit of  their back-bone, and gape up to heaven as if they scorned the very  ground. Let no little man wear iron heels. When we visit a friend of  ours in Queen-street we are disturbed from our labours or conversation  by a sound which resembles the well-timed marching of a file of infantry  or a troop of dismounted dragoons. We hobble as fast as possible to the  window, and are sure to see some chappie of about five feet high  stumping on the pavement with his most properly named cuddy-heels; and  we stake our credit, we never yet heard a similar clatter from any of  his majesty's subjects of a rational and gentlemanly height--We mean  from five feet eleven (our own height) up to six feet three.    Is a man tall? Let him never wear a surtout. It is the most unnatural,  and therefore the most awkward dress that ever was invented. On a tall  man, if he be thin, it appears like a cossack-trouser on a stick leg; if  it be buttoned, it makes his leanness and lankness still more appalling  and absurd; if it be open, it appears to be no part of his costume, and  leads us to suppose that some elongated habit-maker is giving us a  specimen of that rare bird, the flying tailor.    We go on a visit to the country for a few days, and the neighbourhood is  famous for its beautiful prospects. Though, for our own individual  share, we would rather go to the catacombs alone, than to a splendid  view in a troop, we hate to balk young people! and as even now a  walking-stick chair is generally carried along for our behoof, we seldom  or ever remain at home when all the rest of the party trudge off to some  \"bushy bourne or mossy dell.\" On these occasions how infinitely superior  the female is to the male part of the species! The ladies, in a quarter  of an hour after the proposal of the ploy, appear all in readiness to  start, each with her walking-shoes and parasol, with a smart reticule  dangling from her wrist. The gentlemen, on the other hand, get off with  their great, heavy Wellingtons, which, after walking half a mile, pinch  them at the toe, and make the pleasure excursion confine them to the  house for weeks. Then some fool, the first gate or stile we come to, is  sure to show off his vaulting, and upsets himself in the ditch on the  opposite side, instead of going quietly over and helping the damosels  across. And then, if he does attempt the polite, how awkwardly the  monster makes the attempt! We come to a narrow ditch with a plank across  it--He goes only half way, and standing in the middle of the plank,  stretches out his hand and pulls the unsuspecting maiden so forcibly,  that before he has time to get out of the way, the impetus his own tug  has produced, precipitates them both among the hemlock and nettles,  which, you may lay it down as a general rule, are to be found at the  thoroughfares in every field.    We hold that every man behaves with awkwardness when he is in love, and  the want of the one is a presumption of the absence of the other. When  people are fairly engaged, there is perhaps less of this directly _to  the object_, but there is still as much of it in her presence; but it is  wonderful how soon the most nervous become easy when marriage has  concluded all their hopes. Delicate girl! just budding into womanly  loveliness, whose heart, for the last ten minutes, has been trembling  behind the snowy wall of thy fair and beautiful bosom, hast thou never  remarked and laughed at a tall and much-be-whiskered young man for the  _mauvaise honte_ with which he hands to thee thy cup of half-watered  souchong? Laugh not at him again, for he will assuredly be thy husband.    Love, when successful is well enough, and perhaps it has treasures of  its own to compensate for its inconveniences; but a more miserable  situation than that of an unhappy individual before the altar, it is not  in the heart of man to conceive. First of all, you are marched with a  solitary male companion up the long aisle, which on this occasion  appears absolutely interminable; then you meet your future partner  dressed out in satin and white ribbons, whom you are sure to meet in  gingham gowns or calico prints, every morning of your life ever after.  There she is, supported by her old father, decked out in his  old-fashioned brown coat, with a wig of the same colour, beautifully  relieving the burning redness of his huge projecting ears; and the  mother, puffed up like an overgrown bolster, encouraging the trembling  girl, and joining her maiden aunts of full fifty years, in telling her  to take courage, for it is what they must all come to. Bride's-maids and  mutual friends make up the company; and there, standing out before this  assemblage, you assent to everything the curate, or, if you are rich  enough, the rector, or even the dean, may say, shewing your knock-knees  in the naked deformity of white kerseymeres, to an admiring bevy of the  servants of both families, laughing and tittering from the squire's pew  in the gallery. Then the parting!--The mother's injunctions to the  juvenile bride to guard herself from the cold, and to write within the  week. The maiden aunts' inquiries, of, \"My dear, have you forgot  nothing?\"--the shaking of hands, the wiping and winking of eyes! By  Hercules!--there is but one situation more unpleasant _in_ this world,  and that is, bidding adieu to your friends, the ordinary and jailor,  preparatory to swinging from the end of a halter _out_ of it. The lady  all this time seems not half so awkward. She has her gown to keep from  creasing, her vinaigrette to play with; besides, that all her  nervousness is interesting and feminine, and is laid to the score of  delicacy and reserve.    _Blackwood's Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.

THE NEW YEAR.    The Chinese make their new year commence on the new moon, nearest to the  time when the sun's place is in the 15th degree of Aquarius. It is the  greatest festival observed in the empire. Both the government and the  people, rich and poor, take a longer or shorter respite from their cares  and their labours at the new year.    The last day of the old year is an anxious time to all debtors and  creditors, for it is the great pay-day, and those who cannot pay are  abused and insulted, and often have the furniture of their house all  smashed to pieces by their desperate creditors.    On the 20th of the twelfth moon, by an order from court, all the seals  of office, throughout the empire, are locked up, and not opened till the  20th of the first moon. By this arrangement there are thirty days of  rest from the ordinary official business of government. They attend,  however, to extraordinary cases.

Such a people were extremely  receptive of modes and fashions,--the aptest learners as well as the  boldest adventurers; not patient in study nor skilful to invent, but  swift to seize and appropriate, terrible breakers-up of old religious  spells. They dissolved the old material civilization of Cushite and  Turanian origin. What passion for vast conquests! \"These rugged tribes,  devoted to their chiefs, led by Cyrus from their herds and  hunting-grounds to startle the pampered Lydians with their spare diet  and clothing of skins; living on what they could get, strangers to wine  and wassail, schooled in manly exercises, cleanly even to superstition,  loyal to age and filial duties; with a manly pride of personal  independence that held a debt the next worst thing to a lie; their  fondness for social graces, their feudal dignities, their chiefs giving  counsel to the king even while submissive to his person, esteeming  prowess before praying; their strong ambition, scorning those who  scorned toil.\" Artaxerxes wore upon his person the worth of twelve  thousand talents, yet shared the hardships of his army in the march,  carrying quiver and shield, leading the way to the steepest places, and  stimulating the hearts of his soldiers by walking twenty-five miles  a day.    There was much that is interesting about the ancient Persians. All the  old authorities, especially Herodotus, testify to the comparative purity  of their lives, to their love of truth, to their heroism in war, to the  simplicity of their habits, to their industry and thrift in battling  sterility of soil and the elements of Nature, to their love of  agricultural pursuits, to kindness towards women and slaves, and above  all other things to a strong personality of character which implied a  powerful will. The early Persians chose the bravest and most capable of  their nobles for kings, and these kings were mild and merciful. Xenophon  makes Cyrus the ideal of a king,--the incarnation of sweetness and  light, conducting war with a magnanimity unknown to the ancient nations,  dismissing prisoners, forgiving foes, freeing slaves, and winning all  hearts by a true nobility of nature. He was a reformer of barbarous  methods of war, and as pure in morals as he was powerful in war. In  short, he had all those qualities which we admire in the chivalric  heroes of the Middle Ages.    There was developed among this primitive and virtuous people a religion  essentially different from that of Assyria and Egypt, with which is  associated the name of Zoroaster, or Zarathushtra. Who this  extraordinary personage was, and when he lived, it is not easy to  determine. Some suppose that he did not live at all. It is most probable  that he lived in Bactria from 1000 to 1500 B.C.; but all about him is  involved in hopeless obscurity.    The Zend-Avesta, or the sacred books of the Persians, are mostly hymns,  prayers, and invocations addressed to various deities, among whom Ormazd  was regarded as supreme. These poems were first made known to European  scholars by Anquetil du Perron, an enthusiastic traveller, a little more  than one hundred years ago, and before the laws of Menu were translated  by Sir William Jones. What we know about the religion of Persia is  chiefly derived from the Zend-Avesta. _Zend_ is the interpretation of  the Avesta. The oldest part of these poems is called the Gathas,  supposed to have been composed by Zoroaster about the time of Moses.    As all information about Zoroaster personally is unsatisfactory, I  proceed to speak of the religion which he is supposed to have given to  the Iranians, according to Dr. Martin Haug, the great authority on  this subject.    Its peculiar feature was dualism,--two original uncreated principles;  one good, the other evil. Both principles were real persons, possessed  of will, intelligence, power, consciousness, engaged from all eternity  in perpetual contest. The good power was called Ahura-Mazda, and the  evil power was called Angro-Mainyus. Ahura-Mazda means the \"Much-knowing  spirit,\" or the All-wise, the All-bountiful, who stood at the head of  all that is beneficent in the universe,--\"the creator of life,\" who made  the celestial bodies and the earth, and from whom came all good to man  and everlasting happiness. Angro-Mainyus means the black or dark  intelligence, the creator of all that is evil, both moral and physical.  He had power to blast the earth with barrenness, to produce earthquakes  and storms, to inflict disease and death, destroy flocks and the fruits  of the earth, excite wars and tumults; in short, to send every form of  evil on mankind. Ahura-Mazda had no control over this Power of evil; all  he could do was to baffle him.    These two deities who divided the universe between them had each  subordinate spirits or genii, who did their will, and assisted in the  government of the universe,--corresponding to our idea of angels  and demons.    Neither of these supreme deities was represented by the early Iranians  under material forms; but in process of time corruption set in, and  Magism, or the worship of the elements of Nature, became general. The  elements which were worshipped were fire, air, earth, and water.  Personal gods, temples, shrines, and images were rejected. But the most  common form of worship was that of fire, in Mithra, the genius of light,  early identified with the sun. Hence, practically, the supreme god of  the Persians was the same that was worshipped in Assyria and Egypt and  India,--the sun, under various names; with this difference, that in  Persia there were no temples erected to him, nor were there graven  images of him. With the sun was associated a supreme power that presided  over the universe, benignant and eternal. Fire itself in its pure  universality was more to the Iranians than any form. \"From the sun,\"  says the Avesta, \"are all things sought that can be desired.\" To fire,  the Persian kings addressed their prayers. Fire, or the sun, was in the  early times a symbol of the supreme Power, rather than the Power itself,  since the sun was created by Ahura-Mazda (Ormazd). It was to him that  Zoroaster addressed his prayers, as recorded in the Gathas. \"I worship,\"  said he, \"the Creator of all things, Ahura-Mazda, full of light....  Teach thou me, Ahura-Mazda, out of thyself, from heaven by thy mouth,  whereby the world first arose.\" Again, from the Khorda-Avesta we read:  \"In the name of God, the giver, forgiver, rich in love, praise be to the  name of Ormazd, who always was, always is, and always will be; from whom  alone is derived rule.\" From these and other passages we infer that the  religion of the Iranians was monotheistic. And yet the sun also was  worshipped under the name of Mithra. Says Zoroaster: \"I invoke Mithra,  the lofty, the immortal, the pure, the sun, the ruler, the eye of  Ormazd.\" It would seem from this that the sun was identified with the  Supreme Being. There was no other power than the sun which was  worshipped. There was no multitude of gods, nothing like polytheism,  such as existed in Egypt. The Iranians believed in one supreme, eternal  God, who created all things, beneficent and all-wise; yet this supreme  power was worshipped under the symbol of the sun, although the sun was  created by him. This confounding the sun with a supreme and intelligent  being makes the Iranian religion indefinite, and hard to be  comprehended; but compared with the polytheism of Egypt and Babylon, it  is much higher and purer. We see in it no degrading rites, no offensive  sacerdotalism, no caste, no worship of animals or images; all is  spiritual and elevated, but little inferior to the religion of the  Hebrews. In the Zend-Avesta we find no doctrines; but we do find prayers  and praises and supplication to a Supreme Being. In the Vedas--the Hindu  books--the powers of Nature are gods; in the Avesta they are spirits, or  servants of the Supreme.    \"The main difference between the Vedic and Avestan religions is that in  the latter the Vedic worship of natural powers and phenomena is  superseded by a more ethical and personal interest. Ahura-Mazda  (Ormazd), the living wisdom, replaces Indra, the lightning-god. In Iran  there grew up, what India never saw, a consciousness of world-purpose,  ethical and spiritual; a reference of the ideal to the future rather  than the present; a promise of progress; and the idea that the law of  the universe means the final deliverance of good from evil, and its  eternal triumph.\" [1]    [Footnote 1: Samuel Johnson's Religion of Persia.]    The loftiness which modern scholars like Haug, Lenormant, and Spiegel  see in the Zend-Avesta pertains more directly to the earlier portions of  these sacred writings, attributable to Zoroaster, called the Gathas. But  in the course of time the Avesta was subjected to many additions and  interpretations, called the Zend, which show degeneracy. A world of myth  and legend is crowded into liturgical fragments. The old Bactrian tongue  in which the Avesta was composed became practically a dead language.  There entered into the Avesta old Chaldaean traditions. It would be  strange if the pure faith of Zoroaster should not be corrupted after  Persia had conquered Babylon, and even after its alliance with Media,  where the Magi had great reputation for knowledge. And yet even with the  corrupting influence of the superstitions of Babylon, to say nothing of  Media, the Persian conquerors did not wholly forget the God of their  fathers in their old Bactrian home. And it is probable that one reason  why Cyrus and"]]]
