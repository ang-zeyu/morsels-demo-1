This was the first    and only wrong story Mary Matilda ever told.      Having grasped little Bessie by the hand, Mary Matilda stepped over    the fence and was soon lost to view. Scarcely had she gone when a    tall, thin, haggard looking young man came down the street and leaned    over the back gate.      \"Can you tell me,\" he asked in weary tones, \"whether the beautiful    Mary Matilda abides hereabouts?\"      \"She lives here,\" replied Eddie Martin, \"but she has gone for a walk    with little Bessie.\"      \"Whither did they drift?\" queried the mysterious unknown.      \"They started toward the Nashwaaksis,\" said Eddie Martin. \"And I    sadly fear the deadly musquash will pursue them.\"      The stranger turned pale and trembled at the suggestion.      \"Will you lend me your saw for a brief period?\" he asked.      \"Why?\" inquired Eddie Martin.      \"To rescue the fair Mary Matilda from the musquashes,\" replied the    stranger. Then he seized the saw, and with pale face started in the    direction Mary Matilda had gone.      Meanwhile Mary Matilda had crossed the Nashwaaksis and was speeding    in a southerly course toward the Nashwaak. The gentle breeze favored    her progress, and as she sailed along, the snow danced like frozen    feathers around her.      \"Oh, how nice!\" cried little Bessie.      \"Yes, this clear, fresh, cold air gives one new life,\" said Mary    Matilda.      They now came to the Nashwaak, on the farther bank of which were    crouched a pack of hungry musquashes eagerly awaiting the approach of    Mary Matilda and little Bessie.      \"Hush,\" whispered the old big musquash. \"Make no noise or they will    hear us and make good their escape.\" But just then another musquash    carelessly trod on the big musquash's tail and the old musquash    roared with pain.      \"What was that?\" cried little Bessie.      Mary Matilda had heard the strange cry. She paused to listen. Then    she saw the pack of musquashes in the snow on the farthest bank of    the Nashwaak. Oh, how frightened she was! but with a shrill cry she    seized Bessie in her arms, and, turning swiftly about, fled in the    direction of McLeod hill. The musquashes saw her retreating, and with    a howl of commingled rage and disappointment they started in hot    pursuit. They ran like mad, as only starving musquashes can run.    Every moment they gained on the maiden and her human charge until at    last they were at her very heels. Mary Matilda remembered she had    some beechnuts in her pocket. She reached down, grasped a handful of    the succulent fruit and cast it to her insatiate pursuers. It stayed    their pursuit for a moment, but in another moment they were on her    track again, howling demoniacally. Another handful of the beechnuts    went to the ravenous horde, and still another. By this time Mary    Matilda had reached McLeod hill and was crossing the Nashwaaksis. Her    imagination pictured a scuttled brigantine lying in the frozen    stream. On its slippery deck stood a pirate, waving a gory cutlass.    [Illustration: THE PRINCE'S COAT-OF-ARMS--FLIGHT OF THE FAIR MARY  MATILDA--THE AGGRAVATING MIRAGE.]      \"Ha, ha, ho, ho!\" laughed the gory and bearded pirate.      \"Save me!\" cried Mary Matilda. \"My beechnuts are all gone!\"      \"Throw them the baby!\" answered the bearded pirate, \"and save    yourself! Ha, ha, ho, ho!\"      Should she do it? Should she throw little Bessie to the devouring    musquashes? No, she could not stoop to that ungenerous deed.      \"No, base pirate!\" she cried. \"I would not so demean myself!\"      But the scuttled brigantine had disappeared. Mary Matilda saw it was    a mirage. Meanwhile the musquashes gained on her. The beechnuts had    whetted their appetite. It seemed as if they were sure of their prey.    But all at once they stopped, and Mary Matilda stopped, too. They    were confronted by a haggard but manly form. It was the mysterious    young stranger, and he had a saw which Eddie Martin had lent him. His    aspect was so terrible that the musquashes turned to flee, but they    were too late. The mysterious stranger laid about him so vigorously    with his saw that the musquashes soon were in bits. Here was a tail,    there a leg; here an ear, there a nose--oh, it was a rare potpourri,    I can tell you! Finally the musquashes all were dead.      \"To whom am I indebted for my salvation?\" inquired Mary Matilda,    blushing deeply.      \"Alas, I do not know,\" replied the wan stranger. \"I am called Juan,    but my lineage is enveloped in gloom.\"      At once Mary Matilda suspected he was her brother's missing friend,    and this suspicion was confirmed by the lavender trousers he wore.    She questioned him closely, and he told her all. Bessie heard all he    said, and she could tell you more particularly than I can about it. I    only know that Juan confessed that, having tasted of Mary Matilda's    cake, he fell deeply in love with her and had come all this distance    to ask her to be his, indissolubly.      \"Still,\" said he, sadly, \"'tis too much to ask you to link your    destiny with one whose lineage is not known.\"      By this time they had reached the back-yard gate. Eddie Martin was    sitting on the wood-pile talking with a weird old woman. The weird    old woman scrutinized Mary Matilda closely.      \"Do you know me?\" she asked.      \"No,\" said Mary Matilda.      \"I have been serving ten years for a mild indiscretion,\" said the old    woman, sadly. \"I am the gypsy who told your fortune many years ago.\"      Then the old gypsy's keen eyes fell on Juan, the stranger. She gave a    fierce cry.      \"I have seen that face before!\" she cried, trembling with emotion.    \"When I knew it, it was a baby face; but the spectacles are still the    same!\"    [Illustration: BROTHER SLOSSON AND HIS OTHER FRIEND EN ROUTE TO THE  WEDDING.]      Juan also quivered with emotion.      \"Have you a thistle mark on your left arm?\" demanded the old gypsy,    fiercely.      \"Yes,\" he answered, hoarsely; and pulling up the sleeve of his linen    ulster he exposed the beautiful emblem on his emaciated arm.      \"It is as I suspected!\" cried the old gypsy. \"You are the Prince of    Lochdougal, heir presumptive to the estates and titles of the    Stuarts.\" And with these words the old gypsy swooned in Eddie    Martin's arms.      When she came to, she explained that she had been a stewardess in the    Lochdougal castle at Inverness when Juan's parents had been exiled    for alleged conspiracy against the queen. Juan was then a prattling    babe; but even then he gave promise of a princely future. Since his    arrival at maturity his parents had feared to impart to him the    secret of his lineage, lest he might return to Scotland and attempt    to recover his estates, thereby incurring the resentment of the    existing dynasty.      Of course when she heard of his noble lineage, Mary Matilda could do    naught but accept the addresses of the brave prince. He speedily    regained his health and flesh under the grateful influences of her    cuisine. The wedding day has been set, and little Bessie is to be one    of her bridesmaids. The brother Slosson is to be present, and he is    to bring with him his other friend, whose name he will not mention,    since his lineage is still in doubt.          CHAPTER III    SOME LETTERS      \"There's no art,\" said the doomed Duncan, \"to find the mind's  construction in the face,\" nor after a somewhat extensive acquaintance  with men and their letters am I inclined to think there is very much  to be found of the true individuality of men in their letters. All  men, and especially literary men, seem to consider themselves on dress  parade in their correspondence, and pose accordingly. Ninety-nine  persons out of a hundred are more self-conscious in writing than they  are in talking. Even the least conscious seem to imagine that what  they put down in black and white is to pass under some censorious eye.  The professional writer, whether his reputation be international,  like that of a Lowell or a Stevenson, or confined to the circle of  his village associates, never appears to pen a line without some  affectation. The literary artist does this with an ease and grace that  provokes comment upon its charming naturalness, the journeyman only  occasions some remark upon his effort to \"show off.\" If language was  given us to conceal thoughts, letter writing goes a step further and  puts the black-and-white mask of deliberation on language.    Eugene Field was no exception to the rule that literary men scarcely  ever write letters for the mere perusal or information of the  recipient. He almost always wrote for an ulterior effect or for an  ulterior audience. But he seldom wrote letters deliberately for  reproduction in his \"Memoirs.\" If he had done so they would have been  written so skilfully that he would have made himself out to be pretty  much the particular kind of a character he pleased. For obvious  reasons most of the communications that passed between Field and  myself were verbal, across a partition in the office, or by notes that  were destroyed as soon as they had served their purpose. That Field  had other correspondents the following request for a postage stamp  will testify:      _THE GOOD KNIGHT'S DIPLOMACY.[1]      One evening in his normal plight    The good but impecunious knight        Addressing Thompson said:    \"Methinks a great increasing fame    Shall add new glory to thy name,        And cluster round thy head.      \"There is no knight but he will yield    Before thy valor in the Field        Or in exploits of arms;    And all admit the pleasing force    Of thy most eloquent discourse--        Such are thy social charms.      \"Alike to lord and vassal dear    Thou dost incline a pitying ear        To fellow-men in pain;    And be he wounded, sick, or broke,    No brother knight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#6)"],[1,"on a blackboard.  For the moon is utterly reasonable; and the moon is the mother  of lunatics and has given to them all her name.        III THE SUICIDE OF THOUGHT           The phrases of the street are not only forcible but subtle:  for a figure of speech can often get into a crack too small for  a definition.  Phrases like \"put out\" or \"off colour\" might have  been coined by Mr. Henry James in an agony of verbal precision.  And there is no more subtle truth than that of the everyday phrase  about a man having \"his heart in the right place.\"  It involves the  idea of normal proportion; not only does a certain function exist,  but it is rightly related to other functions.  Indeed, the negation  of this phrase would describe with peculiar accuracy the somewhat morbid  mercy and perverse tenderness of the most representative moderns.  If, for instance, I had to describe with fairness the character  of Mr. Bernard Shaw, I could not express myself more exactly  than by saying that he has a heroically large and generous heart;  but not a heart in the right place.  And this is so of the typical  society of our time.         The modern world is not evil; in some ways the modern  world is far too good.  It is full of wild and wasted virtues.  When a religious scheme is shattered (as Christianity was shattered  at the Reformation), it is not merely the vices that are let loose.  The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage.  But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander  more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage.  The modern  world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad.  The virtues  have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other  and are wandering alone.  Thus some scientists care for truth;  and their truth is pitiless.  Thus some humanitarians only care  for pity; and their pity (I am sorry to say) is often untruthful.  For example, Mr. Blatchford attacks Christianity because he is mad  on one Christian virtue:  the merely mystical and almost irrational  virtue of charity.  He has a strange idea that he will make it  easier to forgive sins by saying that there are no sins to forgive.  Mr. Blatchford is not only an early Christian, he is the only  early Christian who ought really to have been eaten by lions.  For in his case the pagan accusation is really true:  his mercy  would mean mere anarchy.  He really is the enemy of the human race--  because he is so human.  As the other extreme, we may take  the acrid realist, who has deliberately killed in himself all  human pleasure in happy tales or in the healing of the heart.  Torquemada tortured people physically for the sake of moral truth.  Zola tortured people morally for the sake of physical truth.  But in Torquemada's time there was at least a system that could  to some extent make righteousness and peace kiss each other.  Now they do not even bow.  But a much stronger case than these two of  truth and pity can be found in the remarkable case of the dislocation  of humility.         It is only with one aspect of humility that we are here concerned.  Humility was largely meant as a restraint upon the arrogance  and infinity of the appetite of man.  He was always outstripping  his mercies with his own newly invented needs.  His very power  of enjoyment destroyed half his joys.  By asking for pleasure,  he lost the chief pleasure; for the chief pleasure is surprise.  Hence it became evident that if a man would make his world large,  he must be always making himself small.  Even the haughty visions,  the tall cities, and the toppling pinnacles are the creations  of humility.  Giants that tread down forests like grass are  the creations of humility.  Towers that vanish upwards above  the loneliest star are the creations of humility.  For towers  are not tall unless we look up at them; and giants are not giants  unless they are larger than we.  All this gigantesque imagination,  which is, perhaps, the mightiest of the pleasures of man, is at bottom  entirely humble.  It is impossible without humility to enjoy anything--  even pride.         But what we suffer from to-day is humility in the wrong place.  Modesty has moved from the organ of ambition.  Modesty has settled  upon the organ of conviction; where it was never meant to be.  A man was meant to be doubtful about himself, but undoubting about  the truth; this has been exactly reversed.  Nowadays the part  of a man that a man does assert is exactly the part he ought not  to assert--himself.  The part he doubts is exactly the part he  ought not to doubt--the Divine Reason.  Huxley preached a humility  content to learn from Nature.  But the new sceptic is so humble  that he doubts if he can even learn.  Thus we should be wrong if we  had said hastily that there is no humility typical of our time.  The truth is that there is a real humility typical of our time;  but it so happens that it is practically a more poisonous humility  than the wildest prostrations of the ascetic.  The old humility was  a spur that prevented a man from stopping; not a nail in his boot  that prevented him from going on.  For the old humility made a man  doubtful about his efforts, which might make him work harder.  But the new humility makes a man doubtful about his aims, which will make  him stop working altogether.         At any street corner we may meet a man who utters the frantic  and blasphemous statement that he may be wrong.  Every day one  comes across somebody who says that of course his view may not  be the right one.  Of course his view must be the right one,  or it is not his view.  We are on the road to producing a race  of men too mentally modest to believe in the multiplication table.  We are in danger of seeing philosophers who doubt the law of gravity  as being a mere fancy of their own.  Scoffers of old time were too  proud to be convinced; but these are too humble to be convinced.  The meek do inherit the earth; but the modern sceptics are too meek  even to claim their inheritance.  It is exactly this intellectual  helplessness which is our second problem.         The last chapter has been concerned only with a fact of observation:  that what peril of morbidity there is for man comes rather from  his reason than his imagination.  It was not meant to attack the  authority of reason; rather it is the ultimate purpose to defend it.  For it needs defence.  The whole modern world is at war with reason;  and the tower already reels.         The sages, it is often said, can see no answer to the riddle  of religion.  But the trouble with our sages is not that they  cannot see the answer; it is that they cannot even see the riddle.  They are like children so stupid as to notice nothing paradoxical  in the playful assertion that a door is not a door.  The modern  latitudinarians speak, for instance, about authority in religion  not only as if there were no reason in it, but as if there had never  been any reason for it.  Apart from seeing its philosophical basis,  they cannot even see its historical cause.  Religious authority  has often, doubtless, been oppressive or unreasonable; just as  every legal system (and especially our present one) has been  callous and full of a cruel apathy.  It is rational to attack  the police; nay, it is glorious.  But the modern critics of religious  authority are like men who should attack the police without ever  having heard of burglars.  For there is a great and possible peril  to the human mind:  a peril as practical as burglary.  Against it  religious authority was reared, rightly or wrongly, as a barrier.  And against it something certainly must be reared as a barrier,  if our race is to avoid ruin.         That peril is that the human intellect is free to destroy itself.  Just as one generation could prevent the very existence of the next  generation, by all entering a monastery or jumping into the sea, so one  set of thinkers can in some degree prevent further thinking by teaching  the next generation that there is no validity in any human thought.  It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith.  Reason is itself a matter of faith.  It is an act of faith to assert  that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.  If you are  merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question,  \"Why should ANYTHING go right; even observation and deduction?  Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic?  They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?\"  The young sceptic says, \"I have a right to think for myself.\"  But the old sceptic, the complete sceptic, says, \"I have no right  to think for myself.  I have no right to think at all.\"         There is a thought that stops thought.  That is the only thought  that ought to be stopped.  That is the ultimate evil against which  all religious authority was aimed.  It only appears at the end of  decadent ages like our own:  and already Mr. H.G.Wells has raised its  ruinous banner; he has written a delicate piece of scepticism called  \"Doubts of the Instrument.\"  In this he questions the brain itself,  and endeavours to remove all reality from all his own assertions,  past, present, and to come.  But it was against this remote ruin  that all the military systems in religion were originally ranked  and ruled.  The creeds and the crusades, the hierarchies and the  horrible persecutions were not organized, as is ignorantly said,  for the suppression of reason.  They were organized for the difficult  defence of reason.  Man, by a blind instinct, knew that if once  things were wildly questioned, reason could be questioned first.  The authority of priests to absolve, the authority of popes to define  the authority, even of inquisitors to terrify:  these were all only dark  defences erected round one central authority, more undemonstrable,  more supernatural than all--the authority of a man to think.  We know now that this is so; we have "]]]
