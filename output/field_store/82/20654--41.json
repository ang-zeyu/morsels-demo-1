Real., Parte 1, lib. 1, cap. 26.    Acosta speaks of the eldest brother of the Inca as succeeding in  preference to the son.  (lib. 6, cap. 12.) He may have confounded  the Peruvian with the Aztec usage.  The Report of the Royal  Audience states that a brother succeeded in default of a son.  Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms.]    [Footnote 27: \"Et soror et conjux.\" - According to Garcilasso the  heir-apparent always married a sister.  (Com. Real., Parte 1,  lib. 4, cap. 9.) Ondegardo notices this as an innovation at the  close of the fifteenth century. (Relacion Primera, Ms.) The  historian of the Incas, however, is confirmed in his  extra-ordinary statement by Sarmiento.  Relacion, Ms., cap. 7.]  In his early years, the royal offspring was intrusted to the care  of the amautas, or \"wise men,\" as the teachers of Peruvian  science were called, who instructed him in such elements of  knowledge as they possessed, and especially in the cumbrous  ceremonial of their religion, in which he was to take a prominent  part.  Great care was also bestowed on his military education, of  the last importance in a state which, with its professions of  peace and good-will, was ever at war for the acquisition of  empire.    In this military school he was educated with such of the Inca  nobles as were nearly of his own age; for the sacred name of Inca  - a fruitful source of obscurity in their annals - was applied  indifferently to all who descended by the male line from the  founder of the monarchy. *28 At the age of sixteen the pupils  underwent a public examination, previous to their admission to  what may be called the order of chivalry.  This examination was  conducted by some of the oldest and most illustrious Incas.  The  candidates were required to show their prowess in the athletic  exercises of the warrior; in wrestling and boxing, in running  such long courses as fully tried their agility and strength, in  severe fasts of several days' duration, and in mimic combats,  which, although the weapons were blunted, were always attended  with wounds, and sometimes with death.  During this trial, which  lasted thirty days, the royal neophyte fared no better than his  comrades, sleeping on the bare ground, going unshod, and wearing  a mean attire, - a mode of life, it was supposed, which might  tend to inspire him with more sympathy with the destitute.  With  all this show of impartiality, however, it will probably be doing  no injustice to the judges to suppose that a politic discretion  may have somewhat quickened their perceptions of the real merits  of the heir-apparent.    [Footnote 28: Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 1, cap. 26.]  At the end of the appointed time, the candidates selected as  worthy of the honors of their barbaric chivalry were presented to  the sovereign, who condescended to take a principal part in the  ceremony of inauguration.  He began with a brief discourse, in  which, after congratulating the young aspirants on the  proficiency they had shown in martial exercises, he reminded them  of the responsibilities attached to their birth and station; and,  addressing them affectionately as \"children of the Sun,\" he  exhorted them to imitate their great progenitor in his glorious  career of beneficence to mankind.  The novices then drew near,  and, kneeling one by one before the Inca, he pierced their ears  with a golden bodkin; and this was suffered to remain there till  an opening had been made large enough for the enormous pendants  which were peculiar to their order, and which gave them, with the  Spaniards, the name of orejones. *29 This ornament was so massy  in the ears of the sovereign, that the cartilage was distended by  it nearly to the shoulder, producing what seemed a monstrous  deformity in the eyes of the Europeans, though, under the magical  influence of fashion, it was regarded as a beauty by the natives.    [Footnote 29: From oreja, \"ear.\" - \"Los caballeros de la sangre  Real tenian orejas horadadas, y de ellas colgando grandes rodetes  de plata y oro: Ilamaronles por esto los orejones los Castellanos  la primera vez que los vieron.\" (Montesinos, Memorias Antiguas  Historiales del Peru, Ms., lib. 2, cap. 6.) The ornament, which  was in the form of a wheel, did not depend from the ear, but was  inserted in the gristle of it, and was as large as an orange. \"La  hacen tan ancha como una gran rosca de naranja; los Senores i  Principales traian aquellas roscas de oro fino en las orejas.\"  (Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms. - Also Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte  1, lib. 1, cap. 22.) \"The larger the hole,\" says one of the old  Conquerors, \"the more of a gentleman!\" Pedro Pizarro, Descub. y  Conq., Ms.]    When this operation was performed, one of the most venerable of  the nobles dressed the feet of the candidates in the sandals worn  by the order, which may remind us of the ceremony of buckling on  the spurs of the Christian knight.  They were then allowed to  assume the girdle or sash around the loins, corresponding with  the toga virilis of the Romans, and intimating that they had  reached the season of manhood.  Their heads were adorned with  garlands of flowers, which, by their various colors, were  emblematic of the clemency and goodness that should grace the  character of every true warrior; and the leaves of an evergreen  plant were mingled with the flowers, to show that these virtues  should endure without end. *30 The prince's head was further  ornamented by a fillet, or tasselled fringe, of a yellow color,  made of the fine threads of the vicuna wool, which encircled the  forehead as the peculiar insignia of the heir-apparent.  The  great body of the Inca nobility next made their appearance, and,  beginning with those nearest of kin, knelt down before the  prince, and did him homage as successor to the crown.  The whole  assembly then moved to the great square of the capital, where  songs, and dances, and other public festivities closed the  important ceremonial of the huaracu. *31    [Footnote 30: Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 6, cap. 27.]    [Footnote 31: Ibid. Parte 1, lib. 6, cap. 24 - 28.    According to Fernandez, the candidates wore white shirts, with  something like a cross embroidered in front!  (Historia del Peru,  (Sevilla, 1571,) Parte 2, lib. 3, cap. 6.) We may fancy ourselves  occupied with some chivalrous ceremonial of the Middle Ages.]    The reader will be less surprised by the resemblance which this  ceremonial bears to the inauguration of a Christian knight in the  feudal ages, if he reflects that a similar analogy may be traced  in the institutions of other people more or less civilized; and  that it is natural that nations, occupied with the one great  business of war, should mark the period, when the preparatory  education for it was ended, by similar characteristic ceremonies.  Having thus honorably passed through his ordeal, the  heir-apparent was deemed worthy to sit in the councils of his  father, and was employed in offices of trust at home, or, more  usually, sent on distant expeditions to practice in the field the  lessons which he had hitherto studied only on the mimic theatre  of war.  His first campaigns were conducted under the renowned  commanders who had grown grey in the service of his father;  until, advancing in years and experience, he was placed in  command himself, and, like Huayna Capac, the last and most  illustrious of his line, carried the banner of the rainbow, the  armorial ensign of his house, far over the borders, among the  remotest tribes of the plateau.    The government of Peru was a despotism, mild in its character,  but in its form a pure and unmitigated despotism.  The sovereign  was placed at an immeasurable distance above his subjects.  Even  the proudest of the Inca nobility, claiming a descent from the  same divine original as himself, could not venture into the royal  presence, unless barefoot, and bearing a light burden on his  shoulders in token of homage. *32 As the representative of the  Sun, he stood at the head of the priesthood, and presided at the  most important of the religious festivals. *33 He raised armies,  and usually commanded them in person.  He imposed taxes, made  laws, and provided for their execution by the appointment of  judges, whom he removed at pleasure. He was the source from which  every thing flowed, - all dignity, all power, all emolument.  He  was, in short, in the well-known phrase of the European despot,  \"himself the state.\" *34    [Footnote 32: Zarate, Conq. del Peru, lib. 1, cap. 11. -  Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 7.    \"Porque verdaderamente a lo que yo he averiguado toda la  pretension de los Ingas fue una subjeccion en toda la gente, qual  yo nunca he oido decir de ninguna otra nacion en tanto grado, que  por muy principal que un Senor fuese, dende que entrava cerca del  Cuzco en cierta senal que estava puesta en cada camino de quatro  que hay, havia dende alli de venir cargado hasta la presencia del  Inga, y alli dejava la carga y hacia su obediencia.\" Ondegardo,  Rel. Prim., Ms.]    [Footnote 33: It was only at one of these festivals, and hardly  authorizes the sweeping assertion of Carli, that the royal and  sacerdotal authority were blended together in Peru.  We shall  see, hereafter, the important and independent position occupied  by the high-priest.  \"La Sacerdoce et l'Empire etoient divises au  Mexique; au lieu qu'i's etoient reunis au Perou, comme au Tibet  et a la Chine, et comme il"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#6)"],[1,"now known as the Ashmolean Museum. He also bequeathed his  library to the University. His wife was a _dau._ of Sir W. Dugdale, the  antiquary.      ASSER (_d._ 909?).--Chronicler, a monk of St. David's, afterwards Bishop  of Sherborne, was the friend, helper, and biographer of AElfred. In  addition to his life of AElfred he wrote a chronicle of England from 849  to 887.      ATHERSTONE, EDWIN (1788-1872).--Poet and novelist. His works, which were  planned on an imposing scale, attracted some temporary attention and  applause, but are now forgotten. His chief poem, _The Fall of Nineveh_,  consisting of thirty books, appeared at intervals from 1828 to 1868. He  also produced two novels, _The Sea Kings in England_ and _The Handwriting  on the Wall_.      ATTERBURY, FRANCIS (1662-1732).--Controversialist and preacher, was _b._  near Newport Pagnel, Bucks, and _ed._ at Westminster School and Oxford.  He became the leading protagonist on the High Church side in the  ecclesiastical controversies of his time, and is believed to have been  the chief author of the famous defence of Dr. Sacheverell in 1712. He  also wrote most of Boyle's _Examination of Dr. Bentley's Dissertations on  the Epistles of Phalaris_, and _pub._ sermons, which, with his letters to  Swift, Pope, and other friends, constitute the foundation of his literary  reputation. During the reign of the Tories he enjoyed much preferment,  having been successively Canon of Exeter, Dean of Christ Church, Dean of  Westminster, and Bishop of Rochester. His Jacobite principles, however,  and his participation in various plots got him into trouble, and in 1722  he was confined in the Tower, deprived of all his offices, and ultimately  banished. He _d._ at Paris, Feb. 15, 1732, and was buried privately in  Westminster Abbey.      AUBREY, JOHN (1626-1697).--Antiquary, was a country gentleman who  inherited estates in several counties in England, which he lost by  litigation and otherwise. He devoted himself to the collection of  antiquarian and miscellaneous observations, and gave assistance to  Dugdale and Anthony a-Wood in their researches. His own investigations  were extensive and minute, but their value is much diminished by his  credulity, and want of capacity to weigh evidence. His only publication  is his _Miscellanies_, a collection of popular superstitions, etc., but  he left various collections, which were edited and _publ._ in the 19th  century.      AUSTEN, JANE (1775-1817).--Novelist, _dau._ of a clergyman, was _b._ at  the rectory of Steventon near Basingstoke. She received an education  superior to that generally given to girls of her time, and took early to  writing, her first tale being begun in 1798. Her life was a singularly  uneventful one, and, but for a disappointment in love, tranquil and  happy. In 1801 the family went to Bath, the scene of many episodes in her  writings, and after the death of her _f._ in 1805 to Southampton, and  later to Chawton, a village in Hants, where most of her novels were  written. A tendency to consumption having manifested itself, she removed  in May, 1817, to Winchester for the advantage of skilled medical  attendance, but so rapid was the progress of her malady that she died  there two months later. Of her six novels, four--_Sense and Sensibility_  (1811), _Pride and Prejudice_ (1813), _Mansfield Park_ (1814) and _Emma_  (1816)--were _pub._ anonymously during her life-time; and the others,  _Northanger Abbey_--written in 1798--and _Persuasion_, finished in 1816,  appeared a few months after her death, when the name of the authoress was  divulged. Although her novels were from the first well received, it is  only of comparatively late years that her genius has gained the wide  appreciation which it deserves. Her strength lies in the delineation of  character, especially of persons of her own sex, by a number of minute  and delicate touches arising out of the most natural and everyday  incidents in the life of the middle and upper classes, from which her  subjects are generally taken. Her characters, though of quite ordinary  types, are drawn with such wonderful firmness and precision, and with  such significant detail as to retain their individuality absolutely  intact through their entire development, and they are never coloured by  her own personality. Her view of life is genial in the main, with a  strong dash of gentle but keen satire: she appeals rarely and slightly to  the deeper feelings; and the enforcement of the excellent lessons she  teaches is left altogether to the story, without a word of formal  moralising. Among her admirers was Sir W. Scott, who said, \"That young  lady has a talent for describing the involvements of feelings and  characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met  with;\" others were Macaulay (who thought that in the world there were no  compositions which approached nearer to perfection), Coleridge, Southey,  Sydney Smith, and E. FitzGerald.      AUSTIN, JOHN (1790-1859).--Jurist, served in the army in Sicily and  Malta, but, selling his commission, studied law, and was called to the  Bar 1818. He did not long continue to practise, but devoted himself to  the study of law as a science, and became Professor of Jurisprudence in  London University 1826-32. Thereafter he served on various Royal  Commissions. By his works he exercised a profound influence on the views  of jurisprudence held in England. These include _The Province of  Jurisprudence Determined_ (1832), and his _Lectures on Jurisprudence_.      AYTON, SIR ROBERT (1570-1638).--Poet, _s._ of A. of Kinaldie in Fife.  After _grad._ at St. Andrews, he studied law at Paris, became ambassador  to the Emperor, and held other court offices. He appears to have been  well-known to his literary contemporaries in England. He wrote poems in  Latin, Greek, and English, and was one of the first Scotsmen to write in  the last. His chief poem is _Diophantus and Charidora; Inconstancy  Upbraided_ is perhaps the best of his short poems. He is credited with a  little poem, _Old Long Syne_, which probably suggested Burns's famous  _Auld Lang Syne_.      AYTOUN, WILLIAM EDMONSTONE (1813-1865).--Poet and humorist, _s._ of Roger  A., a Writer to the Signet, was _b._ in Edinburgh and _ed._ there, and  was brought up to the law, which, however, as he said, he \"followed but  could never overtake.\" He became a contributor to _Blackwood's Magazine_  in 1836, and continued his connection with it until his death. In it  appeared most of his humorous prose pieces, such as _The Glenmutchkin  Railway_, _How I Became a Yeoman_, and _How I Stood for the Dreepdaily  Burghs_, all full of vigorous fun. In the same pages began to appear his  chief poetical work, the _Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers_, and a novel,  partly autobiographical, _Norman Sinclair_. Other works were _The Bon  Gaultier Ballads_, jointly with Theodore Martin, and _Firmilian, a  Spasmodic Tragedy_, under the _nom-de-plume_ of T. Percy Jones, intended  to satirise a group of poets and critics, including Gilfillan, Dobell,  Bailey, and Alexander Smith. In 1845 A. obtained the Chair of Rhetoric  and Belles Lettres in Edinburgh University, which he filled with great  success, raising the attendance from 30 to 150, and in 1852 he was  appointed sheriff of Orkney and Shetland. He was married to a _dau._ of  Professor Wilson (Christopher North).      BACON, FRANCIS, LORD VERULAM, AND VISCOUNT ST. ALBAN'S  (1561-1626).--Philosopher and statesman, was the youngest _s._ of Sir  Nicholas B., Lord Keeper, by his second wife, a _dau._ of Sir Anthony  Cooke, whose sister married William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the great  minister of Queen Elizabeth. He was _b._ at York House in the Strand on  Jan. 22, 1561, and in his 13th year was sent with his elder brother  Anthony to Trinity Coll., Cambridge. Here he first met the Queen, who was  impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to call him  \"the young Lord Keeper.\" Here also he became dissatisfied with the  Aristotelian philosophy as being unfruitful and leading only to  resultless disputation. In 1576 he entered Gray's Inn, and in the same  year joined the embassy of Sir Amyas Paulet to France, where he remained  until 1579. The death of his _f._ in that year, before he had completed  an intended provision for him, gave an adverse turn to his fortunes, and  rendered it necessary that he should decide upon a profession. He  accordingly returned to Gray's Inn, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to  induce Burghley to give him a post at court, and thus enable him to  devote himself to a life of learning, he gave himself seriously to the  study of law, and was called to the Bar in 1582. He did not, however,  desert philosophy, and _pub._ a Latin tract, _Temporis Partus Maximus_  (the Greatest Birth of Time), the first rough draft of his own system.  Two years later, in 1584, he entered the House of Commons as member for  Melcombe, sitting subsequently for Taunton (1586), Liverpool (1589),  Middlesex (1593), and Southampton (1597). In the Parliament of 1586 he  took a prominent part in urging the execution of Mary Queen of Scots.  About this time he seems again to have approached his powerful uncle, the  result of which may possibly be traced in his rapid progress at the Bar,  and in his receiving, in 1589, the reversion to the Clerkship of the  Star Chamber, a valuable appointment, into the enjoyment of which,  however, he did not enter until 1608. About 1591 he formed a friendship  with the Earl of Essex, from whom he received many tokens of kindness ill  requited. In 1593 the offices of Attorney-general, and subsequently of  Solicitor-general became vacant, and Essex used his influence on B.'s  behalf, but unsuccessfully, the former being given to Coke, the famous  lawyer. These disappointments may have been owing to a speech made by B.  on a question of subsidies. To console him for them Essex presented him  with"]]]
