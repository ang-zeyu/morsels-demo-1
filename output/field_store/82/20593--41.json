CHAPTER V.    _The Man From Michigan._           \"How old is she, Billy boy, Billy boy,       How old is she, charming Billy?         Twice six, twice seven,         Forty-nine and eleven--       She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother.\"    \"C'm-awn, yuh lazy old skate! Think I want to sleep out to-night, when  town's so clost?\" Charming Billy yanked his pack-pony awake and into  a shuffling trot over the trail, resettled his hat on his head, sagged  his shoulders again and went back to crooning his ditty.         \"Can she make a punkin pie, Billy boy, Billy boy,       Can she make a punkin pie, charming Billy?         She can make a punkin pie         Quick's a cat can wink her eye--\"    Out ahead, where the trail wound aimlessly around a low sand ridge  flecked with scrubby sage half buried in gray snowbanks, a horse  whinnied inquiringly; Barney, his own red-roan, perked his ears toward  the sound and sent shrill answer. In that land and at that season  travelers were never so numerous as to be met with indifference, and  Billy felt a slight thrill of expectation. All day--or as much of it  as was left after his late sleeping and later breakfast--he had ridden  without meeting a soul; now he unconsciously pressed lightly with his  spurs to meet the comer.    Around the first bend they went, and the trail was blank before them.  \"Thought it sounded close,\" Billy muttered, \"but with the wind where  it is and the air like this, sound travels farther. I wonder--\"    Past the point before them poked a black head, followed slowly by  a shambling horse whose dragging hoofs proclaimed his weariness and  utter lack of ambition. The rider, Billy decided after one sharp  glance, he had never seen before in his life--and nothing lost by it,  either, he finished mentally when he came closer.    If the riders had not willed it so the horses would mutually have  agreed to stop when they met; that being the way of range horses after  carrying speech-hungry men for a season or two. If men meet out there  in the land of far horizons and do not stop for a word or two, it is  generally because there is bad feeling between them; and horses learn  quickly the ways of their masters.    \"Hello,\" greeted Billy tentatively, eying the other measuringly  because he was a stranger. \"Pretty soft going, ain't it?\" He referred  to the half-thawed trail.    \"Ye-es,\" hesitated the other, glancing diffidently down at the trail  and then up at the neighboring line of disconsolate, low hills.  \"Ye-es, it is.\" His eyes came back and met Billy's deprecatingly,  almost like those of a woman who feels that her youth and her charm  have slipped behind her and who does not quite know whether she may  still be worthy your attention. \"Are you acquainted with this--this  part of the country?\"    \"Well,\" Billy had got out his smoking material, from force of the  habit with which a range-rider seizes every opportunity for a smoke,  and singled meditatively a leaf. \"Well, I kinda know it by sight, all  right.\" And in his voice lurked a pride of knowledge inexplicable to  one who has not known and loved the range-land. \"I guess you'd have  some trouble finding a square foot of it that I ain't been over,\" he  added, mildly boastful.    If one might judge anything from a face as blank as that of a china  doll, both the pride and the boastfulness were quite lost upon the  stranger. Only his eyes were wistfully melancholy.    \"My name is Alexander P. Dill,\" he informed Billy quite unnecessarily.  \"I was going to the Murton place. They told me it was only ten miles  from town and it seems as though I must have taken the wrong road,  somehow. Could you tell me about where it would be from here?\"    Charming Billy's cupped hands hid his mouth, but his eyes laughed.  \"Roads ain't so plenty around here that you've any call to take one  that don't belong to yuh,\" he reproved, when his cigarette was going  well. \"If Hardup's the place yuh started from, and if they headed yah  right when they turned yuh loose, you've covered about eighteen miles  and bent 'em into a beautiful quarter-circle--and how yuh ever went  and done it undeliberate gets _me_. You are now seven miles from  Hardup and sixteen miles, more or less, from Murton's.\" He stopped to  watch the effect of his information.    Alexander P. Dill was a long man--an exceedingly long man, as Billy  had already observed--and now he drooped so that he reminded Billy  of shutting up a telescope. His mouth drooped, also, like that of a  disappointed child, and his eyes took to themselves more melancholy.  \"I must have taken the wrong road,\" he repeated ineffectually.    \"Yes,\" Billy agreed gravely, \"I guess yuh must of; it does kinda look  that way.\" There was no reason why he should feel anything more than a  passing amusement at this wandering length of humanity, but Billy  felt an unaccountable stirring of pity and a feeling of indulgent  responsibility for the man.    \"Could you--direct me to the right road?\"    \"Well, I reckon I could,\" Billy told him doubtfully, \"but it would be  quite a contract under the circumstances. Anyway, your cayuse is too  near played; yuh better cut out your visit this time and come along  back to town with me. You're liable to do a lot more wandering around  till yuh find yourself plumb afoot.\" He did not know that he came near  using the tone one takes toward a lost child.    \"Perhaps, seeing I've come out of my way, I might as well,\" Mr. Dill  decided hesitatingly. \"That is, if you don't mind.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind at all,\" Charming Billy assured him airily. \"Uh  course, I own this trail, and the less it's tracked up right now in  its present state the better, but you're welcome to use it--if you're  particular to trod soft and don't step in the middle.\"    Alexander P. Dill looked at him uncertainly, as if his sense of humor  were weak and not to be trusted off-hand; turned his tired horse  awkwardly in a way that betrayed an unfamiliarity with \"neck-reining,\"  and began to retrace his steps beside Charming Billy. His stirrups  were too short, so that his knees were drawn up uncomfortably, and  Billy, glancing sidelong down at them, wondered how the man could ride  like that.    \"You wasn't raised right around here, I reckon,\" Billy began amiably,  when they were well under way.    \"No--oh, no. I am from Michigan. I only came out West two weeks ago.  I--I'm thinking some of raising wild cattle for the Eastern markets.\"  Alexander P. Dill still had the wistful look in his eyes, which were  unenthusiastically blue--just enough of the blue to make their color  definite.    Charming Billy came near laughing, but some impulse kept him  quiet-lipped and made his voice merely friendly. \"Yes--this is a  pretty good place for that business,\" he observed quite seriously. \"A  lot uh people are doing that same thing.\"    Mr. Dill warmed pitifully to the friendliness. \"I was told that Mr.  Murton wanted to sell his far---- ranch and cattle, and I was going to  see him about it. I would like to buy a place outright, you see, with  the cattle all branded, and--everything.\"    Billy suddenly felt the instinct of the champion. \"Well, somebody lied  to yuh a lot, then,\" he replied warmly. \"Don't yuh never go near old  Murton. In the first place, he ain't a cowman--he's a sheepman, on a  small scale so far as sheep go but on a sure-enough big scale when  yuh count his feelin's. He runs about twelve hundred woollies, and is  about as unpolite a cuss as I ever met up with. He'd uh roasted yuh  brown just for saying cattle at him--and if yuh let out inadvertant  that yuh took him for a cowman, the chances is he'd a took a shot at  yuh. If yuh ask me, you was playin' big luck when yuh went and lost  the trail.\"    \"I can't see what would be their object in misinforming me on the  subject,\" Mr. Dill complained. \"You don't suppose that they had any  grudge against Mr. Murton, do you?\"    Charming Billy eyed him aslant and was merciful. \"I can't say, not  knowing who they was that told yuh,\" he answered. \"They're liable to  have a grudge agin' him, though; just about everybody has, that ever  bumped into him.\"    It would appear that Mr. Dill needed time to think this over, for he  said nothing more for a long while. Charming Billy half turned once or  twice to importune his pack-pony in language humorously querulous,  but beyond that he kept silence, wondering what freakish impulse drove  Alexander P. Dill to Montana \"to raise wild cattle for the Eastern  markets.\" The very simplicity of his purpose and the unsophistication  of his outlook were irresistible and came near weaning Charming Billy  from considering his own personal grievances.    For a grievance it was to be turned adrift from the Double-Crank--he,  who had come to look upon the outfit almost with proprietorship; who  for years had said \"my outfit\" when speaking of it; who had set  the searing iron upon sucking calves and had watched them grow to  yearlings, then to sleek four-year-olds; who had at last helped prod  them up the chutes into the cars at shipping time and had seen them  take the long trail to Chicago--the trail from which, for them, there  was no return; who had thrown his rope on kicking, striking \"bronks\";  had worked, with the sweat streaming like tears down his cheeks, to  \"gentle\" them; had, with much patience, taught them the feel of saddle  and cinch and had ridden them with much stress until they accepted his  mastery and became the dependable, wise old \"cow-horses\" of the range;  who had followed, spring, summer and fall, the wide wandering of the  Double-Crank wagons, asking nothing better, secure in the knowledge  that he, Charming Billy Boyle, was conceded to be one of the  Double-Crank's \"top-hands.\" It was bitter to be turned adrift--and for  such a cause! Because he had fought a man who was something less than  a man. It was bitter to feel that he had been condemned without a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#6)"],[1,"the open parks the Airedale Fox showed signs of scenting  game. There was a patch of ground where the grass was pressed down.  Teague whispered and pointed. I saw the gray rump of an elk protruding  from behind some spruces. I beckoned for R.C. and we both dismounted.  Just then the elk rose and stalked out. It was a magnificent bull with  crowning lofty antlers. The shoulders and neck appeared black. He  raised his head, and turning, trotted away with ease and grace for  such a huge beast. That was a wild and beautiful sight I had not seen  before. We were entranced, and when he disappeared, we burst out with  exclamations.    We rode on toward camp, and out upon a bench that bordered the lofty  red wall of rock. From there we went down into heavy forest again, dim  and gray, with its dank, penetrating odor, and oppressive stillness.  The forest primeval! When we rode out of that into open slopes the  afternoon was far advanced, and long shadows lay across the distant  ranges. When we reached camp, supper and a fire to warm cold wet feet  were exceedingly welcome. I was tired.    Later, R.C. and I rode up a mile or so above camp, and hitched our  horses near Teague's old corral. Our intention was to hunt up along  the side of the slope. Teague came along presently. We waited, hoping  the big black clouds would break. But they did not. They rolled down  with gray, swirling edges, like smoke, and a storm enveloped us. We  sought shelter in a thick spruce. It rained and hailed. By and bye  the air grew bitterly cold, and Teague suggested we give up, and ride  back. So we did. The mountains were dim and obscure through the gray  gloom, and the black spear-tipped spruces looked ghostly against  the background. The lightning was vivid, and the thunder rolled and  crashed in magnificent bombardment across the heavens.    Next morning at six-thirty the sun was shining clear, and only a  few clouds sailed in the blue. Wind was in the west and the weather  promised fair. But clouds began to creep up behind the mountains,  first hazy, then white, then dark. Nevertheless we decided to ride  out, and cross the Flattop rim, and go around what they call the  Chinese Wall. It rained as we climbed through the spruces above Little  Trappers Lake. And as we got near the top it began to hail. Again  the air grew cold. Once out on top I found a wide expanse, green and  white, level in places, but with huge upheavals of ridge. There  were flowers here at eleven thousand feet. The view to the rear was  impressive--a wide up-and-down plain studded with out-cropping of  rocks, and patches of snow. We were then on top of the Chinese Wall,  and the view to the west was grand. At the moment hail was falling  thick and white, and to stand above the streaked curtain, as it fell  into the abyss was a strange new experience. Below, two thousand feet,  lay the spruce forest, and it sloped and dropped into the White River  Valley, which in turn rose, a long ragged dark-green slope, up to a  bare jagged peak. Beyond this stretched range on range, dark under the  lowering pall of clouds. On top we found fresh Rocky Mountain sheep  tracks. A little later, going into a draw, we crossed a snow-bank,  solid as ice. We worked down into this draw into the timber. It  hailed, and rained some more, then cleared. The warm sun felt good.  Once down in the parks we began to ride through a flower-garden. Every  slope was beautiful in gold, and red, and blue and white. These parks  were luxuriant with grass, and everywhere we found elk beds, where the  great stags had been lying, to flee at our approach. But we did not  see one. The bigness of this slope impressed me. We rode miles and  miles, and every park was surrounded by heavy timber. At length we  got into a burned district where the tall dead spruces stood sear and  ghastly, and the ground was so thickly strewn with fallen trees that  we had difficulty in threading a way through them. Patches of aspen  grew on the hillside, still fresh and green despite this frosty  morning. Here we found a sego lily, one of the most beautiful of  flowers. Here also I saw pink Indian paint brush. At the foot of this  long burned slope we came to the White River trail, and followed it up  and around to camp.    Late in the evening, about sunset, I took my rifle and slipped off  into the woods back of camp. I walked a short distance, then paused to  listen to the silence of the forest. There was not a sound. It was a  place of peace. By and bye I heard snapping of twigs, and presently  heard R.C. and Teague approaching me. We penetrated half a mile into  the spruce, pausing now and then to listen. At length R.C. heard  something. We stopped. After a little I heard the ring of a horn on  wood. It was thrilling. Then came the crack of a hoof on stone, then  the clatter of a loosened rock. We crept on. But that elk or deer  evaded us. We hunted around till dark without farther sign of any  game.    R.C. and Teague and I rode out at seven-thirty and went down White  River for three miles. In one patch of bare ground we saw tracks of  five deer where they had come in for salt. Then we climbed high up a  burned ridge, winding through patches of aspen. We climbed ridge after  ridge, and at last got out of the burned district into reaches of  heavy spruce. Coming to a park full of deer and elk tracks, we  dismounted and left our horses. I went to the left, and into some  beautiful woods, where I saw beds of deer or elk, and many tracks.  Returning to the horses, I led them into a larger park, and climbed  high into the open and watched. There I saw some little squirrels  about three inches long, and some gray birds, very tame. I waited a  long time before there was any sign of R.C. or Teague, and then it was  the dog I saw first. I whistled, and they climbed up to me. We mounted  and rode on for an hour, then climbed through a magnificent forest of  huge trees, windfalls, and a ferny, mossy, soft ground. At length we  came out at the head of a steep, bare slope, running down to a verdant  park crossed by stretches of timber. On the way back to camp we ran  across many elk beds and deer trails, and for a while a small band of  elk evidently trotted ahead of us, but out of sight.    Next day we started for a few days' trip to Big Fish Lake. R.C. and I  went along up around the mountain. I found our old trail, and was at a  loss only a few times. We saw fresh elk sign, but no live game at all.    In the afternoon we fished. I went up the river half a mile, while  R.C. fished the lake. Neither of us had any luck. Later we caught four  trout, one of which was fair sized.    Toward sunset the trout began to rise all over the lake, but we could  not get them to take a fly.    The following day we went up to Twin Lakes and found them to be  beautiful little green gems surrounded by spruce. I saw some big trout  in the large lake, but they were wary. We tried every way to get a  strike. No use! In the little lake matters were worse. It was full of  trout up to two pounds. They would run at the fly, only to refuse it.  Exasperating work! We gave up and returned to Big Fish. After supper  we went out to try again. The lake was smooth and quiet. All at once,  as if by concert, the trout began to rise everywhere. In a little bay  we began to get strikes. I could see the fish rise to the fly. The  small ones were too swift and the large ones too slow, it seemed.  We caught one, and then had bad luck. We snarled our lines, drifted  wrong, broke leaders, snapped off flies, hooked too quick and too  slow, and did everything that was clumsy. I lost two big fish because  they followed the fly as I drew it toward me across the water to  imitate a swimming fly. Of course this made a large slack line which I  could not get up. Finally I caught one big fish, and altogether we got  seven. All in that little bay, where the water was shallow! In other  places we could not catch a fish. I had one vicious strike. The fish  appeared to be feeding on a tiny black gnat, which we could not  imitate. This was the most trying experience of all. We ought to have  caught a basketful.    The next day, September first, we rode down along the outlet of Big  Fish to White River and down that for miles to fish for grayling. The  stream was large and swift and cold. It appeared full of ice water  and rocks, but no fish. We met fishermen, an automobile, and a camp  outfit. That was enough for me. Where an automobile can run, I do not  belong. The fishing was poor. But the beautiful open valley, flowered  in gold and purple, was recompense for a good deal of bad luck.    A grayling, or what they called a grayling, was not as beautiful a  fish as my fancy had pictured. He resembled a sucker or mullet, had a  small mouth, dark color, and was rather a sluggish-looking fish.    We rode back through a thunderstorm, and our yellow slickers afforded  much comfort.    Next morning was bright, clear, cold. I saw the moon go down over a  mountain rim rose-flushed with the sunrise.    R.C. and I, with Teague, started for the top of the big mountain on  the west. I had a new horse, a roan, and he looked a thoroughbred.  He appeared tired. But I thought he would be great. We took a trail  through the woods, dark green-gray, cool and verdant, odorous and  still. We began to climb. Occasionally we crossed parks, and little  streams. Up near the long, bare slope the spruce trees grew large and  far apart. They were beautiful, gray as if bearded with moss. Beyond  this we got into the rocks and climbing became arduous. Long zigzags  up the slope brought us to the top of a notch, where at the right lay  a patch of snow. The top of the mountain was comparatively flat, but  it had timbered ridges and bare plains and little lakes, with dark  domes, rising beyond. We rode around to the right, climbing out of the  timber to where the dwarf spruces and brush had a hard struggle for  life. "]]]
