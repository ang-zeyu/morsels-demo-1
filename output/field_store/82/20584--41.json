Who knows whether my second wife will have children. I will  not kill him however angry she be;' so they unyoked their ploughs and  went home. He told his wife that he would not kill the boy and scolded  her and ended by giving her a beating. Then she ran away in a passion  but he did not trouble to go and look for her and in a few days her  father and brothers brought her back, and her husband told them what  had happened and they also scolded her and told her to mend her ways.          VII. The Pious Woman.    There was once a very pious woman and her special virtue was that she  would not eat or drink on any day until she had first given alms to a  beggar. One day no beggar came to her house, so by noon she got tired  of waiting, and, tying in her cloth some parched rice, she went to the  place where the women drew water. When she got there she saw a Jugi  coming towards her, she greeted him and said that she had brought  dried rice for him. He said that omens had bidden him come to her  and that he came to grant her a boon: she might ask one favour and  it would be given her. The woman said: \"Grant me this boon--to know  where our souls go after death, and to see at the time of death how  they escape, whether through the nose or the mouth, and where they  go to; and tell me when I shall die and where my soul will go to;  this I ask and no more.\" Then the Jugi answered, \"Your prayer is  granted, but you must tell no one; if you do, the power will depart  from you.\" So saying he took from his bag something like a feather and  brushed her eyes with it and washed them with water. Then the woman's  eyes were opened and she saw spirits--_bongas, bhuts, dains, churins_,  and the souls of dead men; and the Jugi told her not to be afraid,  but not to speak to them lest men should think her mad; then he took  his leave, and she returned home. Now in the village lived a poor man  and his wife and they were much liked because they were industrious  and obedient; shortly afterwards this poor man died and the pious  woman saw men come with a palankin and take away the poor man's soul  with great ceremony. She was pleased at the sight and thought that  the souls of all men were taken away like this. But shortly afterwards  her father-in-law died. He had been a rich man, but harsh, and while  the family were mourning the pious woman saw four sipahis armed with  iron-shod staves and of fierce countenance come to the house and two  entered and took the father-in-law by the neck and thrust him forth;  they bound him and beat him, they knocked him down and as he could  not walk they dragged him away by his legs. The woman followed him to  the end of the garden and when she saw him being dragged away, she  screamed. When her husband's relatives saw her screaming and crying  they were angry and said that she must have killed her father-in-law  by witchcraft, for she did not sit by the corpse and cry but went to  the end of the garden. So after the body had been burnt they held  a council and questioned her and told her that they would hold her  to be a witch, if she could not explain. So she told them of the  power which the Jugi had conferred on her and of what she had seen,  and they believed her and acquitted her of the charge of witchcraft;  but from that time she lost her power and saw no more spirits.          VIII. The Wise Daughter-in-Law.    There was once a rich man who had seven sons, but one day his wife  died and after this the family fell into poverty. All their property  was sold and they lived by selling firewood in the bazar. At last the  wife of the eldest son said to her father-in-law. \"I have a proposal  to make: Do you choose one of us to be head of the family whom all  shall obey; we cannot all be our own masters as at present.\" The old  man said \"Well, I choose you,\" and he assembled the whole family and  made them promise to obey the wife of his eldest son.    Thereupon she told them that they must all go out into the fields  and bring her whatever they found. So the next day they went out  in different directions and the old man found some human excrement  and he thought \"Well, my daughter-in-law told me to bring whatever  I found\" so he wrapped it up in leaves and took it home; and his  daughter-in-law told him that he had done well and bade him hang  up the packet at the back of the house. A few days later he found  the slough of a snake and he took that home and his daughter-in-law  told to tie a clod of earth to it to prevent its being blown away,  and to throw it on to the roof of the house.    Some years after the Raja of the country was ill with cancer of the  face and none of the _ojhas_ could cure him. At last one _ojha_ said  that there was only one medicine which could effect a cure, but he  saw no chance of obtaining it and that was human excrement 12 years  old. Then the Raja sent messengers throughout the kingdom offering a  reward of 200 Rupees to any one who could supply excrement twelve years  old; and when a messenger came to the village where this family lived  the daughter-in-law produced the packet which the old man had brought  home and received the reward of 200 Rupees; and they were all delighted  at making so much money by what the old man had brought home in jest.    And again it happened that the son of a Raja was bathing and he left  his gold belt on the bank and a kite thought it was a snake and flew  off with it. The prince was much distressed at the loss but the Raja  told him not to grieve as the kite must have dropped it somewhere and  he would offer a reward of a thousand rupees for it. Now the kite had  soon found that the belt was not good to eat and seeing the snake's  skin which the old man had thrown on to the roof of the house, it  dropped the belt and flew off with the skin; and the daughter-in-law  picked up the belt and when criers came round offering a reward she  produced it and received the money. And they praised her wisdom and  by this means the family became rich again.          IX. The Oilman and His Sons.    There was once an oilman with five sons and they were all married  and lived jointly with their father. But the daughters-in-law were  discontented with this arrangement and urged their husbands to ask  their father to divide the family property. At first the old man  refused, but when his sons persisted, he told them to bring him a  log two cubits long and so thick that two hands could just span it,  and he said that if they could break the log in two, he would divide  the property; so they brought the log and then asked for axes, but he  told them that they must break it themselves by snapping it or twisting  it or standing on it; so they tried and failed. Then the old man said,  \"You are five and I make six; split the log into six,\" So they split it  and he gave each a piece and told them to break them, and each easily  snapped his stick; then the old man said \"We are like the whole log: we  have plenty of property and are strong and can overcome attack; but if  we separate we shall be like the split sticks and easily broken.\" They  admitted that this was true and proposed that the property should not  be divided but that they should all become separate in mess. But the  father would not agree to this for he thought that people would call  him a miser if he let his sons live separately without his giving  them their share in the property as their own, So as they persisted  in their folly he partitioned the property.    But in a few years they all fell into poverty and had not enough to  eat nor clothes to wear, and the father and mother were no better off;  then the old man called all his sons and their wives and said \"You see  what trouble you have fallen into; I have a riddle for you, explain  it to me. There are four wells, three empty and one full of water;  if you draw water from the full one and pour it into the three empty  ones they will become full; but when they are full and the first one  is empty, if you pour water from the three full ones into the empty  one it will not be filled; what does this mean?\" And they could not  answer and he said, \"The four wells mean that a man had three sons,  and while they were little he filled their stomachs as the wells were  filled with water; but when they separated they would not fill the  old man's stomach.\"    And it was true, that the sons had done nothing to help their father  and they were filled with shame and they agreed that as long as their  father lived they would be joint with him and would not separate  again until he died.          X. The Girl Who Found Helpers.    Once upon a time there were seven brothers, and they were all married,  and they had one sister who was not married. The brothers went away  to a far country for a whole year, leaving their wives at home. Now  the wives hated their sister-in-law and did their best to torment  her. So one day they gave her a pot full of holes and told her to  bring it back full of water; and threatened that if she failed she  should have no food. So she took the pot to the spring and there sat  down and cried and sang:--          \"I am fetching water in a pot full of holes,      I am fetching water in a pot full of holes,      How far away have my brothers gone to trade.\"      After she had cried a long time, a number of frogs came up out of  the water and asked her what was the matter, and she told them that  she must fill the pot with water, and was not allowed to stop the  holes with clay or lac. Then they told her not to cry, and said, that  they would sit on the holes and then the water would not run out;  they did this and the girl dried her eyes and filled the pot with  water and took it home. Her sisters-in-law were much disappointed at  her success, but the next day they told her to go to the jungle and  bring back a bundle of leaves, but she was to use no rope for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"fell back on the nearest streets of the town,  leaving open the approach to the temple, upon which the barbarians threw  themselves.  The pillage of the shrines had just commenced when the sky  looked threatening; a storm burst forth, the thunder echoed, the rain  fell, the hail rattled.  Readily taking advantage of this incident, the  priests and the augurs sallied from the temple clothed in their sacred  garments, with hair dishevelled and sparkling eyes, proclaiming the  advent of the god: \"'Tis he! we saw him shoot athwart the temple's vault,  which opened under his feet; and with him were two virgins, who issued  from the temples of Artemis and Athena.  We saw them with our eyes.  We  heard the twang of their bows, and the clash of their armor.\"  Hearing  these cries and the roar of the tempest, the Greeks dash on--the Gauls  are panic-stricken, and rush headlong down the bill.  The Greeks push on  in pursuit.  Rumors of fresh apparitions are spread; three heroes,  Hyperochus, Laodocus, and Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, have issued from  their tombs hard by the temple, and are thrusting at the Gauls with their  lances.  The rout was speedy and general; the barbarians rushed to the  cover of their camp; but the camp was attacked next morning by the Greeks  from the town and by re-enforcements from the country places.  Brennus  and the picked warriors about him made a gallant resistance, but defeat  was a foregone conclusion.  Brennus was wounded, and his comrades bore  him off the field.  The barbarian army passed the whole day in flight.  During the ensuing night a new access of terror seized them they again  took to flight, and four days after the passage of Thermopylae some  scattered bands, forming scarcely a third of those who had marched on  Delphi, rejoined the division which had remained behind, some leagues  from the town, in the plains watered by the Cephissus.  Brennus summoned  his comrades \"Kill all the wounded and me,\" said he; \"burn your cars;  make Cichor king; and away at full speed.\"  Then he called for wine,  drank himself drunk, and stabbed himself.  Cichor did cut the throats of  the wounded, and traversed, flying and fighting, Thessaly and Macedonia;  and on returning whence they had set out, the Gauls dispersed, some to  settle at the foot of a neighboring mountain under the command of a  chieftain named Bathanat or Baedhannatt, i.e., son of the wild boar;  others to march back towards their own country; the greatest part to  resume the same life of incursion and adventure.  But they changed the  scene of operations.  Greece, Macedonia, and Thrace were exhausted by  pillage, and made a league to resist.  About 278 B.C. the Gauls crossed  the Hellespont and passed into Asia Minor.  There, at one time in the pay  of the kings of Bithynia, Pergamos, Cappadocia, and Syria, or of the free  commercial cities which were struggling against the kings, at another  carrying on wars on their own account, they wandered for more than thirty  years, divided into three great hordes, which parcelled out the  territories among themselves, overran and plundered them during the fine  weather, intrenched themselves during winter in their camp of cars, or in  some fortified place, sold their services to the highest bidder, changed  masters according to interest or inclination, and by their bravery became  the terror of these effeminate populations and the arbiters of these  petty states.    At last both princes and people grew weary.  Antiochus, King of Syria,  attacked one of the three bands,--that of the Tectosagians,--conquered  it, and cantoned it in a district of Upper Phrygia.  Later still, about  241 B.C., Eumenes, sovereign of Pergamos, and Attalus, his successor,  drove and shut up the other two bands, the Tolistoboians and Troemians,  likewise in the same region.  The victories of Attalus over the Gauls  excited veritable enthusiasm.  He was celebrated as a special envoy from  Zeus.  He took the title of King, which his predecessors had not hitherto  borne.  He had his battles showily painted; and that he might triumph at  the same time both in Europe and Asia, he sent one of the pictures to  Athens, where it was still to be seen three centuries afterwards, hanging  upon the wall of the citadel.  Forced to remain stationary, the Gallic  hordes became a people,--the Galatians,--and the country they occupied  was called Galatia.  They lived there some fifty years, aloof from the  indigenous population of Greeks and Phrygians, whom they kept in an  almost servile condition, preserving their warlike and barbarous habits,  resuming sometimes their mercenary service, and becoming once more the  bulwark or the terror of neighboring states.  But at the beginning of the  second century before our era, the Romans had entered Asia, in pursuit of  their great enemy, Hannibal.  They had just beaten, near Magnesia,  Antiochus, King of Syria.  In his army they had encountered men of lofty  stature, with hair light or dyed red, half naked, marching to the fight  with loud cries, and terrible at the first onset.  They recognized the  Gauls, and resolved to destroy or subdue them.  The consul, Cn. Manlius,  had the duty and the honor.  Attacked in their strongholds on Mount  Olympus and Mount Magaba, 189 B.C., the three Gallic bands, after a short  but stout resistance, were conquered and subjugated; and thenceforth  losing all national importance, they amalgamated little by little with  the Asiatic populations around them.  From time to time they are still  seen to reappear with their primitive manners and passions.  Rome humored  them; Mithridates had them for allies in his long struggle with the  Romans.  He kept by him a Galatian guard; and when he sought death, and  poison failed him, it was the captain of the guard, a Gaul named  Bituitus, whom he asked to run him through.  That is the last historical  event with which the Gallic name is found associated in Asia.    Nevertheless the amalgamation of the Gauls of Galatia with the natives  always remained very imperfect; for towards the end of the fourth century  of the Christian era they did not speak Greek, as the latter did, but  their national tongue, that of the Kymro-Belgians; and St. Jerome  testifies that it differed very little from that which was spoken in  Belgica itself, in the region of Troves.    The Romans had good ground for keeping a watchful eye, from the time they  met them, upon the Gauls, and for dreading them particularly.  At the  time when they determined to pursue them into the mountains of Asia  Minor, they were just at the close of a desperate struggle, maintained  against them for four hundred years, in Italy itself; \"a struggle,\" says  Sallust, \"in which it was a question not of glory, but of existence, for  Rome.\"  It was but just now remarked that at the beginning of the sixth  century before our era, whilst, under their chieftain Sigovesus, the  Gallic bands whose history has occupied the last few pages were crossing  the Rhine and entering Germany, other bands, under the command of  Bellovesus, were traversing the Alps and swarming into Italy.  From 587  to 521 B.C. five Gallic expeditions, formed of Gallic, Kymric, and  Ligurian tribes, followed the same route and invaded successively the two  banks of the Po--the bottomless river, as they called it.  The Etruscans,  who had long before, it will be remembered, themselves wrested that  country from a people of Gallic origin, the Umbrians or Ambrons, could  not make head against the new conquerors, aided, may be, by the remains  of the old population.  The well-built towns, the cultivation of the  country, the ports and canals that had been dug, nearly all these labors  of Etruscan civilization disappeared beneath the footsteps of these  barbarous hordes that knew only how to destroy, and one of which gave its  chieftain the name of Hurricane (Elitorius, Ele-Dov).  Scarcely five  Etruscan towns, Mantua and Ravenna amongst others, escaped disaster.  The  Gauls also founded towns, such as Mediolanum (Milan), Brixia (Brescia),  Verona, Bononia (Bologna), Sena-Gallica (Sinigaglia), &c.  But for a long  while they were no more than intrenched camps, fortified places, where  the population shut themselves up in case of necessity.  \"They, as a  general rule, straggled about the country,\" says Polybius, the most  correct and clear-sighted of the ancient historians, \"sleeping on grass  or straw, living on nothing but meat, busying themselves about nothing  but war and a little husbandry, and counting as riches nothing but flocks  and gold, the only goods that can be carried away at pleasure and on  every occasion.\"    During nearly thirty years the Gauls thus scoured not only Upper Italy,  which they had almost to themselves, but all the eastern coast, and up to  the head of the peninsula, encountering along the Adriatic, and in the  rich and effeminate cities of Magna Graecia, Sybaris, Tarentum, Crotona,  and Locri, no enemy capable of resisting them.  But in the year 391 B.C.,  finding themselves cooped up in their territory, a strong band of Gauls  crossed the Apennines, and went to demand from the Etruscans of Clusium  the cession of a portion of their lands.  The only answer Clusium made  was to close her gates.  The Gauls formed up around the walls.  Clusium  asked help from Rome, with whom, notwithstanding the rivalry between the  Etruscan and Roman nations, she had lately been on good terms.  The  Romans promised first their good offices with the Gauls, afterwards  material support; and thus were brought face to face those two peoples,  fated to continue for four centuries a struggle which was to be ended  only by the complete subjection of Gaul.    The details of that struggle belong specially to Roman history; they have  been transmitted to us only by Roman historians; and the Romans it was  who were left ultimately in possession of the battle-field, that is, of  Italy."]]]
