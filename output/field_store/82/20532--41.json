As before stated, the gallery had its origin in my desire to teach the  children simultaneously. It enables a teacher more readily to secure  their full attention in all oral lessons, and establishes a sympathy  between them. More real facts may be taught children simultaneously by  the master, than can be taught by all the monitors in a school. The  little infants should always sit at the bottom, and by no means be  confined to another room. They can see and hear all that is going on,  and understand it far more than you would suppose, though they cannot  yet tell all they learn and know; but when the power of speech comes,  they will surprise you with what they have learned. It is therefore a  great error to separate children and cut them off from the advantage  of all object-lessons, and gallery-teaching, because they are the  youngest. They learn more through sympathy and communion with their  five or six year elders, than the most clever adult can teach them. An  infant-school, is, in many respects, a community in a state of nature.  What one does, the other almost involuntarily learns. The merest  infants are not an exception to this rule, and therefore the  separation in many infant-schools of the children, invariably into  two classes, sometimes in two rooms, is a great mistake, and can only  arise from ignorance of the laws under which the young mind  unfolds itself, and a misunderstanding of the first principles of  infant-teaching.    Perhaps one reason that infant-school teaching has not been kept up to  its proper point and true standing, is, the desire to make a striking  shew before the visitors in a school. I fear the grounds for this  opinion are not slight. Perhaps nothing has lead more to the  multiplication of singing, even to the injury of the children. The  ease with which they learn a metrical piece by _rote_, and the  readiness with which they acquire a tune to it, is surprising, and as  the exhibition of such attainments forms a striking sinew, in many  cases little else is taught them. But to a sensible and thinking mind,  one single piece _understood_, that is, one where clear ideas are  annexed to the words in the minds of the children, is worth a hundred  where this is not the case. Intellectual improvement, and moral  training, are not thus easily exhibited, especially, the latter; but  on dilligent attention to these, the real and permanent utility of the  schools depends.    Many things have been taught most unsuitable for young children, and  that simplicity which is so absolutely requisite, both as regards  matter and language, seriously departed from. Let but the great  principle of teaching through the senses be borne distinctly in mind,  and of giving ideas in preference to sounds, and it will have a strong  tendency to put an end to the evil complained of. How much may  be taught by the simplest object, such as a stone?  Form--weight--hardness, colour, sound, and numerous other qualities  and properties, all of which must be clearly understood, because they  are demonstrated by the sight and other senses. Once give to the mind  a store of clear ideas in regular and natural order, and a series of  words that are distinct and definite in meaning, and you have laid a  firm foundation whereon to exercise the higher faculties of reflection  and reasoning. Still more is it of paramount importance to educate and  bring out the moral faculties, to cultivate the sense of right and  wrong, to enlighten and strengthen the young conscience, to teach the  love of good, and the hatred of evil, and to strive to bring the whole  being under the new commandment of Christ, \"that ye love one another.\"  The golden rule, \"to do unto others as ye would that they should do  unto you,\" is one of the most powerful precepts that can be applied to  awaken just moral feelings; and innumerable instances must occur,  in the varied events which happen in a school, to bring it home  powerfully to the heart, and illustrate it appropriately.    Perhaps in nothing has that simplicity of teaching so requisite for  the young, and so earnestly contended for by me throughout, been  so much disregarded, neglected, and preverted as in the matter of  religion. I taught from the first, by means of pictures properly  selected, scriptural truths and facts, histories and parables; and  also suitable texts, and simple hymns and prayers were added. This  surely was enough for _infants_. I thought so then, and I think so  still, for an overdoing always ends in an undoing, and the mind of a  child should never be crammed with that which it cannot understand, to  the neglect of that which it may. I have opened schools for many sects  and parties, and have been sorry to find them so prone to bind the  \"grevious burdens\" of their own peculiar dogmas on the feeble minds of  little children, to the neglect of the \"weightier matters of the law,  justice, mercy, and the love of God.\" I hope a time will come when the  distinct precepts of Christ, in this respect, will be more faithfully  regarded. The religion for infants should be a simple trust in \"the  love and kindness of God our Saviour,\" a desire of grace and strength  from Him, and an aim to live thereby in love and duty to their parents  and teachers, and in kindness and affection with their brothers,  sisters, and schoolfellows. Such things as these, their young  minds may apprehend, feel, and apply, and thus be strengthened and  benefitted, but scholastic subtelties, and controverted dogmas, such  as the grey-headed are perpetually disputing about, surely should  never be taught to infants by any one who has carefully considered the  subject, and properly studied the nature of the infant mind.    In all probability advancing years will prevent me in future from  personally labouring much in the cause, and from personally overcoming  objections, by presenting publicly, facts that cannot be refuted. It  is out of my power now to employ agents and pay them. I cannot  take infants by sea and land to convince unbelievers, and silence  gainsayers. Neither circumstances nor remaining strength, will allow  me to repeat these things. I must trust then to my pen, to the  thinkers amongst us, and above all to the good Providence of God, for  further success in behalf of the rising generation. Those who doubt  what I assert about children should recollect one fact--twenty-seven  thousand have passed through my hands, and were for a short time under  my training, and have then been examined by me to convince a doubting  public, on the spot where they happened to be in each town and  country, all this for the period of one-third of a century. Ought not  this to entitle me, as respects the education of children, to say such  a thing is right, or even such a thing is wrong? The abuse of a plan  is no argument against its use. That it has been abused I am well  aware,--that the _parrot-system_ has been revived and also applied in  infant-schools. It was never intended to injure the young brain by  over-exciting it, or to fill the memory with useless rubbish; yet this  is done. I cannot help it. I have done and will do my best to prevent  such a violation of the very first principles of infant teaching. To  conclude, there is much to be thankful for! Since the infant-system  was evolved, a very great improvement has taken place in the character  of school-books, and also in prints. The graphic illustrations and the  simplicity of style, on a variety of subjects, is admirable. The same  may be said with respect to nursery books; I see a great improvement  in all these. This is comforting to one situated as I am, and leads me  to hope much from the future. I trust the intellectual character of  the age will advance, and not only the intellectual but also the moral  and spiritual, and \"that truth and justice, religion and piety may be  established amongst us for all generations.\"          CHAPTER II.

The prospect was not an alluring  one; and hence, to avoid an involuntary visit to the scenes of his  childhood, he sought liberty beyond the sea, where men of his color  have always enjoyed a larger freedom than in their native land.    In 1845 Douglass set sail for England on board the _Cambria_, of the  Cunard Line, accompanied by James N. Buffum, a prominent abolitionist  of Lynn, Massachusetts. On the same steamer were the Hutchinson  family, who lent their sweet songs to the anti-slavery crusade.  Douglass's color rendered him ineligible for cabin passage, and he was  relegated to the steerage. Nevertheless, he became quite the lion of  the vessel, made the steerage fashionable, was given the freedom  of the ship, and invited to lecture on slavery. This he did to the  satisfaction of all the passengers except a few young men from New  Orleans and Georgia, who, true to the instincts of their caste, made  his strictures on the South a personal matter, and threatened to throw  him overboard. Their zeal was diminished by an order of the captain to  put them in irons. They sulked in their cabins, however, and rushed  into print when they reached Liverpool, thus giving Douglass the very  introduction he needed to the British public, which was promptly  informed, by himself and others, of the true facts in regard to the  steamer speech and the speaker.          VI.      The two years Douglass spent in Great Britain upon this visit were  active and fruitful ones, and did much to bring him to that full  measure of development scarcely possible for him in slave-ridden  America. For while the English government had fostered slavery prior  to the Revolution, and had only a few years before Douglass's visit  abolished it in its own colonies, this wretched system had never  fastened its clutches upon the home islands. Slaves had been brought  to England, it is true, and carried away; but, when the right to  remove them was questioned in court, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield,  with an abundance of argument and precedent to support a position  similar to that of Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, had taken the  contrary view, and declared that the air of England was free, and the  slave who breathed it but once ceased thereby to be a slave. History  and humanity have delivered their verdict on these two decisions, and  time is not likely to disturb it.    A few days after landing at Liverpool, Douglass went to Ireland, where  the agitation for the repeal of the union between Great Britain and  Ireland was in full swing, under the leadership of Daniel O'Connell,  the great Irish orator. O'Connell had denounced slavery in words  of burning eloquence. The Garrisonian abolitionists advocated the  separation of the free and slave States as the only means of securing  some part of the United States to freedom. The American and Irish  disunionists were united by a strong bond of sympathy. Douglass was  soon referred to as \"the black O'Connell,\" and lectured on slavery and  on temperance to large and enthusiastic audiences. He was introduced  to O'Connell, and exchanged compliments with him. A public breakfast  was given him at Cork, and a soiree by Father Matthew, the eminent  leader of the great temperance crusade which at that time shared with  the repeal agitation the public interest of Ireland. A reception to  Douglass and his friend Buffum was held in St. Patricks Temperance  Hall, where they were greeted with a special song of welcome, written  for the occasion. On January 6, 1846, a public breakfast was given  Douglass at Belfast, at which the local branch of the British and  Foreign Anti-slavery Society presented him with a Bible bound in gold.    After four months in Ireland, where he delivered more than fifty  lectures, Douglass and his friend Buffum left Ireland, on January 10,  1846, for Scotland, where another important reform was in progress. It  was an epoch of rebellion against the established order of things.  The spirit of revolt was in the air. The disruption movement in the  Established Church of Scotland, led by the famous Dr. Chalmers, had  culminated in 1843 in the withdrawal of four hundred and seventy  ministers, who gave up the shelter and security of the Establishment  for the principle that a congregation should choose its own pastor,  and organized themselves into the Free Protesting Church, commonly  called the Free Kirk. An appeal had been issued to the Presbyterian  churches of the world for aid to establish a sustentation fund for the  use of the new church. Among the contributions from the United States  was one from a Presbyterian church in Charleston, South Carolina. Just  before this contribution arrived a South Carolina judge had condemned  a Northern man to death for aiding the escape of a female slave. This  incident had aroused horror and indignation throughout Great Britain.  Lord Brougham had commented on it in the House of Lords, and Lord  Chief Justice Denham had characterized it \"in the name of all the  judges of England\" as a \"horrible iniquity.\" O'Connell had rejected  profferred contributions from the Southern States, and an effort was  made in Scotland to have the South Carolina money sent back. The  attempt failed ultimately; but the agitation on the subject was for a  time very fierce, and gave Douglass and his friends the opportunity to  strike many telling blows at slavery. He had never minced his words in  the United States, and he now handled without gloves the government  whose laws had driven him from its borders.    From Scotland Douglass went to England, where he found still another  great reform movement nearing a triumphant conclusion. The Anti-corn  Law League, after many years of labor, under the leadership of Richard  Cobden and John Bright, for the abolition of the protective tariff on  wheat and other kinds of grain for food, had brought its agitation to  a successful issue; and on June 26, 1846, the Corn Laws were repealed.  The generous enthusiasm for reform of one kind or another that  pervaded the British Islands gave ready sympathy and support to the  abolitionists in their mission. The abolition of slavery in the  colonies had been decreed by Parliament in 1833, but the old leaders  in that reform had not lost their zeal for liberty. George Thompson,  who with Clarkson and Wilberforce had led the British abolitionists,  invited Garrison over to help reorganize the anti-slavery sentiment of  Great Britain against American slavery; and in August, 1846, Garrison  went to England, in that year evidently a paradise of reformers.    During the week beginning May 17, 1846, Douglass addressed  respectively the annual meeting of the British and Foreign  Anti-slavery Society, a peace convention, a suffrage extension  meeting, and a temperance convention, and spoke also at a reception  where efforts were made to induce him to remain in England, and money  subscribed to bring over his family. As will be seen hereafter, he  chose the alternative of returning to the United States.    On August 7, 1846, Douglass addressed the World's Temperance  Convention, held at Covent Garden Theatre, London. There were many  speakers, and the time allotted to each was brief; but Douglass never  lost an opportunity to attack slavery, and he did so on this occasion  over the shoulder of temperance. He stated that he was not a delegate  to the convention, because those whom he might have represented were  placed beyond the pale of American temperance societies either by  slavery or by an inveterate prejudice against their color. He referred  to the mobbing of a procession of colored temperance societies in  Philadelphia several years before, the burning of one of their  churches, and the wrecking of their best temperance hall. These  remarks brought out loud protests and calls for order from the  American delegates present, who manifested the usual American  sensitiveness to criticism, especially on the subject of slavery; but  the house sustained Douglass, and demanded that he go on. Douglass was  denounced for this in a letter to the New York papers by Rev. Dr. Cox,  one of the American delegates.    Douglass's reply to this letter gave him the better of the  controversy. He sometimes expressed the belief, founded on long  experience, that doctors of divinity were, as a rule, among the most  ardent supporters of slavery. Dr. Cox, who seems at least to have met  the description, was also a delegate to the Evangelical Alliance,  which met in London, August 19, 1846, with a membership of one  thousand delegates from fifty different evangelical sects throughout  the world. The question was raised in the convention whether or not  fellowship should be held with slaveholders. Dr. Cox and the other  Americans held that it should, and their views ultimately prevailed.  Douglass made some telling speeches at Anti-slavery League meetings,  in denunciation of the cowardice of the Alliance, and won a wide  popularity.    Douglass remained in England two years. Not only did this visit give  him a great opportunity to influence British public opinion against  slavery, but the material benefits to himself were inestimable. He  had left the United States a slave before the law, denied every civil  right and every social privilege, literally a man without a country,  and forced to cross the Atlantic among the cattle in the steerage of  the steamboat. During his sojourn in Great Britain an English lady,  Mrs. Ellen Richardson, of Newcastle, had raised seven hundred and  fifty dollars, which was paid over to Hugh Auld, of Maryland, to secure  Douglass's legal manumission; and, not content with this generous  work, the same large-hearted lady had raised by subscription about  two thousand five hundred dollars, which Douglass carried back to the  United States as a free gift, and used to start his"]]]
