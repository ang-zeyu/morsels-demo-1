She was  owned by a doctor but I can't call his name. She gets her name from her  husband's owners. They came from Virginia. They didn't take the name of  their owners in Louisiana. They took the name of the owners in Virginia.  She was a twin--her twin was a boy named June and her name was Hetty.  Her master kept her brother to be a driver for him. She was sent from  Virginia to Louisiana to people that were related to her Virginia  people. She called her Louisiana mistress 'White Ma;' she never did call  her 'missis.' The white folks and the colored folks too called her  Indian because she was mixed with Choctaw. That's the Indian that has  brown spots on the jaw. They're brownskin. It was an Indian from the  Oklahoma reservation that said my mother belonged to the Choctaws.    \"She rode from Virginia to Louisiana on a boat at the age of twelve  years. She was separated from her mother and brothers and sisters and  never did see them again. She was kept in the house for a nurse. She was  not a midwife. She nursed the white babies. That was what she was sent  to Louisiana for--to nurse the babies. The Louisiana man that owned her  was named George Dorkins. But I think this white woman came from  Virginia. She married this Louisiana man, then sent back to her father's  house and got grandma; she got her for a nurse. She worked only a year  and a half in the field before peace was declared. After she got grown  and married, my grandfather--she had to stay with him and cook and keep  house for him. That was during slavery time but after George Dorkins  died. Dorkins went and got hisself a barrel of whiskey--one of these  great big old barrels--and set it up in his house, and put a faucet in  it and didn't do nothin' but drink whiskey. He said he was goin' to  drink hisself to death. And he did.    \"He was young enough to go to war and he said he would drink hisself to  death before he would go, and he did. My grandma used to steal  newspapers out of his house and take them down to the quarters and leave  them there where there were one or two slaves that could read and tell  how the War was goin' on. I never did learn how the slaves learned to  read. But she was in the house and she could steal the papers and send  them down. Later she could slip off and they would tell her the news,  and then she could slip the papers back.    \"Her master drank so much he couldn't walk without falling and she would  have to help him out. Her mistress was really good. She never allowed  the overseer to whip her. She was only whipped once in slave time while  my father's mother was whipped more times than you could count.    \"Her master often said, 'I'll drink myself to death before I'll go to  war and be shot down like a damn target.' She said in living with them  in the house, she learned to cuss from him. She said she was a cussin'  soul until she became a Christian. She wasn't 'fraid of them because she  was kin to them in some way. There was another woman there who was some  kin to them and she looked enough like my grandma for them to be kin to  each other. We talked it over several times and said we believed we were  related; but none of us know for sure.    \"When the slaves wanted something said they would have my grandma say it  because they knew she wouldn't be whipped for it. 'White Ma' wouldn't  let nobody whip her if she knew it. She cussed the overseer out that  time for whipping her.    \"When grandma was fourteen or fifteen years old they locked her up in  the seed house once or twice for not going to church. You see they let  the white folks go to the church in the morning and the colored folks in  the evening, and my grandma didn't always want to go. She would be  locked up in the seed bin and she would cuss the preacher out so he  could hear her. She would say, 'Master, let us out.' And he would say,  'You want to go to church?' And she would say, 'No, I don't want to hear  that same old sermon: \"Stay out of your missis' and master's hen house.  Don't steal your missis' and master's chickens. Stay out of your missis'  and master's smokehouse. Don't steal your missis' and master's hams.\" I  don't steal nothing. Don't need to tell me not to.'    \"She was tellin' the truth too. She didn't steal because she didn't have  to. She had plenty without stealin'! She got plenty to eat in the house.  But the other slaves didn't git nothin' but fat meat and corn bread and  molasses. And they got tired of that same old thing. They wanted  something else sometimes. They'd go to the hen house and get chickens.  They would go to the smokehouse and get hams and lard. And they would  get flour and anything else they wanted and they would eat something  they wanted. There wasn't no way to keep them from it.    \"The reason she got whipped that time, the overseer wanted her to help  get a tree off the fence that had been blown down by a storm. She told  him that wasn't her work and she wasn't goin' to do it. Old miss was  away at that time. He hit her a few licks and she told old miss when she  came back. Old 'White Ma' told the overseer, 'Don't never put your hands  on her no more no matter what she does. That's more than I do. I don't  hit her and you got no business to do it.'    \"Her husband, my grandfather, was a blacksmith, and he never did work in  the field. He made wagons, plows, plowstocks, buzzard wings--they call  them turning plows now. They used to make and put them on the stocks. He  made anything-handles, baskets. He could fill wagon wheels. He could  sharpen tools. Anything that come under the line of blacksmith, that is  what he did. He used to fix wagons all the time I knowed him. In harvest  time in the fall he would drive from Bienville where they were slaves to  Monroe in Ouachita Parish. He kept all the plows and was sharpening and  fixing anything that got broke. He said he never did get no whipping.    \"His name was Tom Eldridge. They called him 'Uncle Tom'. They was the  mother and father of twelve children. Six lived and six died. One boy  and five girls lived. And one girl and five boys died--half and half. He  died at the age of seventy-five, June 6, 1908. She died January 1920.    \"I came out here in January 1907. I lived in Pine Bluff. From Louisiana  I came to Pine Bluff in 1906. In 1907 I went to Kerr in Lonoke County  and lived there eight years and then I came to Little Rock. I farmed at  Kerr and just worked 'round town those few months in Pine Bluff.  Excusing the time I was in Pine Bluff and Little Rock I farmed.

Cotton, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: About 79      Birth and Age    \"I have been here quite a few years. This life is short. A man ought to  prepare for eternity. I had an uncle who used to say that a person who  went to torment stayed as long as there was a grain of sand on the sea.    \"I was a little boy when slavery broke. I used to go out with my  brother. He watched gaps. I did not have to do anything; I just went out  with him to keep him company. I was scared of the old master. I used to  call him the 'Big Bear.' He was a great big old man.    \"I was about six years old when the War ended, I guess. I don't know how  old I am. The insurance men put me down as seventy-three. I know I was  here in slavery time, and I was just about six years old when the War  ended.      Schooling    \"I got my first learning in Alabama. I didn't learn anything at all in  slavery times. I went to school. I would go to the house in slavery  tine, and there wouldn't be nobody home, and I would go to the bed and  get under it because I was scared.

Then let him go to meet her, for she has no  moccasins. She will be glad to see him, for she is crying all the time.\"    The medicine man told the poor man this, and he got on his horse and  started, as he had been told. He could not believe that it was true. But he  went. At last he got to the place, and a little while after the sun had  risen, as he was lying on a hill looking toward the hills of the Milk  River, he saw a band of antelope running toward him, as he had been told he  would see. He lay there for a long time, but saw nothing else come in  sight; and finally he got angry and thought that what had been told him was  a lie, and he got up to mount his horse and ride back. Just then he saw,  away down, far off on the prairie, a small black speck, but he did not  think it was moving, it was so far off,--barely to be seen. He thought  maybe it was a rock. He lay down again and took sight on the speck by a  straw of grass in front of him, and looked for a long time, and after a  while he saw the speck pass the straw, and then he knew it was  something. He got on his horse and started to ride up and find out what it  was, riding way around it, through the hills and ravines, so that he would  not be seen. He rode up in a ravine behind it, pretty near to it, and then  he could see it was a person on foot. He got out his bow and arrows and  held them ready to use, and then started to ride up to it. He rode toward  the person, and at last he got near enough to see that it was his  wife. When he saw this, he could not help crying; and as he rode up, the  woman looked back, and knew first the horse, and then her husband, and she  was so glad that she fell down and knew nothing.    After she had come to herself and they had talked together, they got on the  horse and rode off toward camp. When he came over the hill in sight of  camp, all the people began to say, \"Here comes the man\"; and at last they  could see from a distance that he had some one on the horse behind him, and  they knew that it must be his wife, and they were glad to see him bringing  her back, for he was a man thought a great deal of, and everybody liked him  and liked his wife and the way he was kind to her.    Then the handsome girl was given to the medicine man and became his wife.        ADVENTURES OF BULL TURNS ROUND      I    Once the camp moved, but one lodge stayed. It belonged to Wolf Tail; and  Wolf Tail's younger brother, Bull Turns Round, lived with him. Now their  father loved both his sons, but he loved the younger one most, and when he  went away with the big camp, he said to Wolf Tail: \"Take care of your young  brother; he is not yet a strong person. Watch him that nothing befall him.\"    One day Wolf Tail was out hunting, and Bull Turns Round sat in front of the  lodge making arrows, and a beautiful strange bird lit on the ground before  him. Then cried one of Wolf Tail's wives, \"Oh, brother, shoot that little  bird.\" \"Don't bother me, sister,\" he replied, \"I am making arrows.\" Again  the woman said, \"Oh, brother, shoot that bird for me.\" Then Bull Turns  Round fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the bird, and the woman went and  picked it up and stroked her face with it, and her face swelled up so big  that her eyes and nose could not be seen. But when Bull Turns Round had  shot the bird, he went off hunting and did not know what had happened to  the woman's face.    Now when Wolf Tail came home and saw his wife's face, he said, \"What is the  matter?\" and his wife replied: \"Your brother has pounded me so that I  cannot see. Go now and kill him.\" But Wolf Tail said, \"No, I love my  brother; I cannot kill him.\" Then his wife cried and said: \"I know you do  not love me; you are glad your brother has beaten me. If you loved me, you  would go and kill him.\"    Then Wolf Tail went out and looked for his brother, and when he had found  him, he said: \"Come, let us get some feathers. I know where there is an  eagle's nest;\" and he took him to a high cliff, which overhung the river,  and on the edge of this cliff was a dead tree, in the top of which the  eagles had built their nest. Then said Wolf Tail, \"Climb up, brother, and  kill the eagles;\" and when Bull Turns Round had climbed nearly to the top,  Wolf Tail called out, \"I am going to push the tree over the cliff, and you  will be killed.\"    \"Oh, brother! oh, brother! pity me; do not kill me,\" said Bull Turns Round.    \"Why did you beat my wife's face so?\" said Wolf Tail.    \"I didn't,\" cried the boy; \"I don't know what you are talking about.\"    \"You lie,\" said Wolf Tail, and he pushed the tree over the cliff. He looked  over and saw his brother fall into the water, and he did not come up  again. Then Wolf Tail went home and took down his lodge, and went to the  main camp. When his father saw him coming with only his wives, he said to  him, \"Where is your young brother?\" And Wolf Tail replied: \"He went hunting  and did not come back. We waited four days for him. I think the bears must  have killed him.\"      II    Now when Bull Turns Round fell into the river, he was stunned, and the  water carried him a long way down the stream and finally lodged him on a  sand shoal. Near this shoal was a lodge of Under Water People  (_S[=u]'-y[=e]-t[)u]p'-pi_), an old man, his wife, and two daughters. This  old man was very rich: he had great flocks of geese, swans, ducks, and  other water-fowl, and a big herd of buffalo which were tame. These buffalo  always fed near by, and the old man called them every evening to come and  drink. But he and his family ate none of these. Their only food was the  bloodsucker.[1]    [Footnote 1: Blackfoot--_Est'-st[)u]k-ki_, suck-bite; from _Est-ah-tope_,  suck, and _I-sik-st[)u]k-ki_, bite.]    Now the old man's daughters were swimming about in the evening, and they  found Bull Turns Round lying on the shoal, dead, and they went home and  told their father, and begged him to bring the person to life, and give him  to them for a husband. \"Go, my daughters,\" he said, \"and make four sweat  lodges, and I will bring the person.\" He went and got Bull Turns Round, and  when the sweat lodges were finished, the old man took him into one of them,  and when he had sprinkled water on the hot rocks, he scraped a great  quantity of sand off Bull Turns Round. Then he took him into another lodge  and did the same thing, and when he had taken him into the fourth sweat  lodge and scraped all the sand off him, Bull Turns Round came to life, and  the old man led him out and gave him to his daughters. And the old man gave  his son-in-law a new lodge and bows and arrows, and many good presents.    Then the women cooked some bloodsuckers, and gave them to their husband,  but when he smelled of them he could not eat, and he threw them in the  fire. Then his wives asked him what he would eat. \"Buffalo,\" he replied,  \"is the only meat for men.\"    \"Oh, father!\" cried the girls, running to the old man's lodge, \"our husband  will not eat our food. He says buffalo is the only meat for men.\"    \"Go then, my daughters,\" said the old man, \"and tell your husband to kill a  buffalo, but do not take nor break any bones, for I will make it alive  again.\" Then the old man called the buffalo to come and drink, and Bull  Turns Round shot a fat cow and took all the meat. And when he had roasted  the tongue, he gave each of his wives a small piece of it, and they liked  it, and they roasted and ate plenty of the meat.        III    One day Bull Turns Round went to the old man and said, \"I mourn for my  father.\"    \"How did you come to be dead on the sand shoal?\" asked the old man. Then  Bull Turns Round told what his brother had done to him.    \"Take this piece of sinew,\" said the old man. \"Go and see your father. When  you throw this sinew on the fire, your brother and his wife will roll, and  twist up and die.\" Then the old man gave him a herd of buffalo, and many  dogs to pack the lodge, and other things; and Bull Turns Round took his  wives, and went to find his father.    One day, just after sunset, they came in sight of the big camp, and they  went and pitched the lodge on the top of a very high butte; and the buffalo  fed close by, and there were so many of them that they covered the whole  hill.    Now the people were starving, and some had died, for they had no  buffalo. In the morning, early, a man arose whose son had starved to death,  and when he went out and saw this lodge on the top of the hill, and all the  buffalo feeding by it, he cried out in a loud voice; and the people all  came out and looked at it, and they were afraid, for they thought it was  _St[=o]n'-i-t[)a]p-i_.[1] Then said the man whose son had died: \"I am no  longer glad to live. I will go up to this lodge, and find out what this  is.\" Now when he said this, all the men grasped their bows and arrows and  followed him, and when they went up the hill, the buffalo just moved out of  their path and kept on feeding; and just as they came to the lodge, Bull  Turns Round came out, and all the people said, \"Here is the one whom we  thought the bears had killed.\" Wolf Tail ran up, and said, \"Oh, brother,  you are not dead. You went to get feathers, but we thought you had been  killed.\" Then Bull Turns Round called his brother into the lodge, and he  threw the sinew on the fire; and Wolf Tail, and his wife, who was standing  outside, twisted up and died.    [Footnote 1: There is no word in English which corresponds to this. It is  used when speaking of things wonderful or supernatural.]    Then Bull Turns Round told his father all that had happened to him; and  when he learned that the people were starving, he filled his mouth with  feathers and blew them out, and the buffalo ran off in every direction, and  he said to the people, \"There is food, go chase it.\" Then the people were  very glad, and they came each one and gave him a present. They gave him  war shirts, bows and arrows, shields,"]]]
