The hat in question was a soft brown beaver that rolled slightly away  from the face and boasted as trimming a single scarlet quill. It was  undeniably becoming, and Bob gave it his unqualified approval.    \"And you will want a veil?\" insinuated the clever young French  saleswoman. \"See--it is charming!\"    She threw over the hat a cobwebby pattern of brown silk net embroidered  heavily with chenille dots and deftly draped it back from Betty's  glowing face.    \"You don't want a veil!\" said Bob bluntly.    Now the mirror told Betty that the veil looked very well indeed, and made  her, she was sure of it, prettier. Betty was a good traveler and the  journey had not tired her. The excitement and pleasure of choosing a new  hat had brought a flush to her cheeks, and the shining brown eyes that  gazed back at her from the glass assured her that a veil was something  greatly to be desired.    \"You don't want it,\" repeated Bob. \"You're only thirteen and you'll look  silly. Do you want to dress like that girl on the train?\"    If Bob had stopped to think he would have realized that his remarks were  not exactly tactful. Especially the reference to Betty's age, just when  she fancied that she looked very grown up indeed. She was fond of  braiding her heavy thick hair and wrapping it around her head so that  there were no hair-ribbons to betray her. In Betty's experience the  border line between a young lady and a little girl was determined by the  absence or presence of hair-ribbons.    \"How much is it?\" she asked the saleswoman.    \"Oh, but six dollars,\" answered that young person with a wave of one  jeweled hand as though six dollars were a mere nothing.    \"I'll take it,\" said Betty decisively. \"And I'll wear it and the hat,  too, please; you can wrap up my old one.\"    Bob was silent until the transaction had been completed and they were out  of the shop.    \"You wait here and I'll see about getting a car to take us along the  Drive,\" he said then.    \"You're--you're not mad at me, are you Bob?\" faltered Betty, putting an  appealing hand on his arm. \"I haven't had any fun with clothes all  summer long.\"    \"No, I'm not mad. But I think you're an awful chump,\" replied Bob with  his characteristic frankness.    Before the drive was over, Betty was inclined to agree with him.    The car was an open one, and while the day was warm and sunny, there was  a lively breeze blowing straight off the lake. The veil persisted in  blowing first into Betty's eyes, then into Bob's, and interfered to an  amazing degree with their enjoyment of the scenery. Finally, as they  rounded a curve and caught the full breath of the breeze, the veil blew  away entirely.    \"Let it go,\" said Betty resignedly. \"It's cost me six dollars to learn I  don't want to wear a veil.\"    Bob privately decided he liked her much better without the flimsy net  affair, but he wisely determined not to air his opinion. There was no  use, he told himself, in \"rubbing it in.\"    They had lunch in a cozy little tea-room and went back to the train like  seasoned travelers. Bob was an ideal companion for such journeys, for he  never lost his head and never missed connections, while nervous haste was  unknown to him.    \"Won't I be glad to see the Littells!\" exclaimed Betty, watching the  porter make up their berths.    \"So shall I,\" agreed Bob. \"Did you ever know such hospitable people,  asking a whole raft of us to spend the week at Fairfields? How many did  Bobby write would be there?\"    \"Let's see,\" said Betty, checking off on her fingers. \"There'll be Bobby  and Louise, of course; and Esther who is too young to go away to school,  but who will want to do everything we do; Libbie Littell and another  Vermont girl we don't know--Frances Martin; you and I; and the five boys  Mr. Littell wrote you about--the Tucker twins, Timothy Derby, Sydney  Cooke and Winifred Marion Brown. Twelve of us! Won't it be fun! I do wish  the Guerin girls could be there, but we'll see them at the school.\"    \"I'd like to see that Winifred Marion chap,\" declared Bob. \"A boy with a  girl's name has his troubles cut out for him, I should say.\"    \"Lots of 'em have girls' names--in history,\" contributed Betty absently.  \"What time do we get into Washington, Bob?\"    \"Around five, probably six p.m., for we're likely to be a bit late,\"  replied Bob. \"Let's go to bed now, Betty, and get an early start in  the morning.\"    The day spent on the train was uneventful, and, contrary to Bob's  expectations, they were on time at every station. Betty's heart beat  faster as the hands of her little wrist watch pointed to 5:45 and the  passengers began to gather up their wraps. The porter came through and  brushed them thoroughly and Betty adjusted her new hat carefully.    The long train slid into the Union Station. With what different  emotions both Bob and Betty had seen the beautiful, brilliantly lighted  building on the occasion of their first trip to Washington! Then each  had been without a friend in the great city, and now they were to be  welcomed by a host.    Betty's cheeks flushed rose-red, but her lovely eyes filled with a sudden  rush of tears.    \"I'm so happy!\" she whispered to the bewildered Bob.    \"Want my handkerchief?\" he asked anxiously, at which Betty tried  not to laugh.          CHAPTER VII    FUN AT FAIRFIELDS      The long platform was crowded. Betty followed Bob, who carried their  bags. She tried to peer ahead, but the moving forms blocked her view.  Just after they passed through the gate, some one caught her.    \"Betty, you lamb! I never was so glad to see any one in my life!\"  cried a gay voice, and Bobby Littell hugged her close in one of her  rare caresses.    Bob Henderson held out his hand as soon as Bobby released Betty. He liked  this straightforward, brusque girl who so evidently adored Betty.    \"Why, Bob, you've grown a foot!\" was Bobby Littell's greeting to him.    Bob modestly disclaimed any such record, and then Louise and Esther, who  had swooped upon Betty, turned to shake hands with him.    \"The rest of the crowd is out in the car,\" said Bobby carelessly.    Outside the station, in the open plaza, a handsome closed car awaited  them. The gray-haired chauffeur, cap in hand, stood back as a procession  of boys and girls advanced upon Bob and Betty and their escort.    \"Oh, Betty, dear!\" Short, plump Libbie Littell, who had relinquished  her claim to the name of \"Betty\" in Betty Gordon's favor some time  ago, hurled herself upon her friend. \"To think we're going to the  same school!\"    \"Well, Frances is going, too,\" said Bobby practically. \"She might like to  be introduced, you know. Betty, this is Frances Martin, a Vermont girl  who is out after all the Latin prizes.\"    Frances smiled a slow, sweet smile, and, behind thick glasses, her dark  near-sighted eyes said that she was very glad to know Betty Gordon.    \"Now the boys!\" announced the irrepressible Bobby, apparently taking  Bob's introduction to Frances for granted. \"The boys will please line up  and I'll indicate them.\"    The five lads obediently came forward and ranged themselves in a row.    \"From left to right,\" chanted Bobby, \"we have the Tucker twins, Tommy and  Teddy, W. M. Brown, who asks his friends to use his initials and punches  those who refuse, Timothy Derby who reads poetry and Sydney Cooke who  ought to--\" and Bobby completed her speech with a wicked grin, for she  had managed to hit several weaknesses.    \"As an introducer,\" she announced calmly to Carter, the personification  of propriety's horror, \"I think I do rather well.\"    They stowed themselves into the limousine somehow, the girls settled more  or less comfortably on the seats, the boys squeezed in between, hanging  on the running board, and spilling over into Carter's domain.    Bob liked the five boys at once, and they seemed to accept him as one of  them. If he had had a little fear that he would feel diffident and  unboyish among lads of his own age, it vanished at the first contact.    \"Betty, you sweet child, how we have missed you!\" cried Mrs. Littell,  standing on the lowest step under the porte-cochere as the car swept up  the drive of Fairfields, as the Littell's home was called.    Behind her waited Mr. Littell, fully recovered from the injury to his  foot which had made him an invalid during Betty's previous visit.    From Carter, who had beamingly greeted her at the station, to the pretty  parlor maid who smiled as Betty entered her room to find her turning down  the bed covers, there was not a servant who did not remember Betty and  seem glad to see her.    \"It is so good to have you two here again,\" Mr. Littell had said.    \"I never knew such people,\" Betty repeated to herself twenty times that  evening. \"How lovely they are to Bob and me!\"    Mrs. Littell, who was happiest when entertaining young people, had put  the six boys on the third floor in three connecting rooms. The girls were  on the second floor, and Esther, the youngest, who had strenuously fought  to be allowed to go to Shadyside with her two sisters, was almost beside  herself with the effort to be in all the rooms at once and hear what  every one was saying.    \"I'm so glad your uncle let you come,\" said Bobby, as they waited for  Betty to change into a light house frock for dinner. \"I don't know much  about this school, except that mother went to school with the principal.\"    That was a characteristic Bobby Littell remark, and the other  girls laughed.    \"I had a letter from a girl who lives in Glenside,\" confided Betty,  re-braiding her hair. \"She and her sister are going--Norma and Alice  Guerin. I know you'll like them."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#6)"],[1,"was among men, and their bulk had rendered  each of them more or less helpless. There seemed to be a mute  understanding between them, and it was never more apparent than when  Maggie whinnied gently in his ear. He stroked her big, bony head, a  lump forming in his throat. If the bullets of little Pete Reeve  dropped him in some far-off trail, the old-broken-down horse would be  the only living creature that would mourn for him.    Outside, the night and the storm swallowed him at once. Before he had  gone fifty feet the house was out of sight. Then, entering the forest  of balsam firs, the force of the wind was lessened, and he made good  time up the first part of the grade. There would probably be no use  for the snowshoes in this region of broken shrubbery before he came to  the timberline.    He swept on with a lengthening stride. He knew this part of the  country like a book, of course, and he seldom stumbled, save when he  came out into a clearing and the wind smote at him from an unexpected  angle. In one of these clearings he stopped and took stock of his  position. Far away to the west and the south, the head of Scalped  Mountain was lost in dim, rushing clouds. He must make for that goal.    Progress became less easy almost at once. The trees that grew in this  elevated region were not tall enough to act as wind breaks; they were  hardly more than shrubs a great deal of the time, and merely served to  force him into detours around dense hedges. Sometimes, in a clearing,  he found himself staggering to the knees in a compacted drift of snow;  sometimes an immense sheet of snow was picked up by the wind and flung  in his face like a blanket.    Indeed the cold and the snow were nothing compared with the wind. It  was now reaching the proportions of a westerly storm of the first  magnitude. Off the towering slopes above, it came with the chill of  the snow and with flying bits of sand, scooped up from around the base  of trees, or with a shower of twigs. Many a time he had to throw up  his arms across his face before he leaned and thrust on into the teeth  of the blast.    But he was growing accustomed to seeing through this veil of snow and  thick darkness. All things were dreamlike in dimness, of course, but  he could make out terrific cloud effects, as the clouds gushed over  the summit and down the slope a little way like the smoke of enormous  guns; and again a pyramid of mist was like a false mountain before  him, a mountain that took on movement and rushed to overwhelm him,  only to melt away and become simply a shadow among shadows above  his head.    Once or twice before the dawn, he rested, not from weariness perhaps,  but from lack of breath, turning his back to the west and bowing his  head. Walking into the wind it had become positively difficult to  draw breath!    Still it gained power incredibly. Up the side of Scalped Mountain it  was a steady weight pressing against him rather than a wind. And now  and then, when the weight relaxed, he stumbled forward on his knees.  For there was now hardly any shelter. He was approaching the  timberline where trees stand as high as a man and little higher.    Dawn found him at the edge of the tree line. He flung himself on his  face, his head on his arms, to rest and wait until the treacherous  time of dawn should have passed. While the day grew steadily his heart  sank. He needed the rest, but the cold bit into him while he lay  extended, and the peril of the summit would be before him for his  march of the day. The wind mourned over him as if it anticipated his  defeat. Never had there been such wind, he thought. It screamed above  him. It dropped away in sudden lulls of more appalling silence. Then,  far off, he would hear a wave of the storm begin, wash across a crest,  thunder in a canyon, and then break on the timberline with a prolonged  and mighty roaring. Those giant approaches made him hold his breath,  and when the wave of confusion passed, he found himself often  breathless.    Day came. He was on the very verge of the line with a dense fence of  stunted trees just before him and the wilderness of snow beyond,  sloping up to the crest, outlined in white against the solid gray sky.  The Spartans of the forest were around him--fir, pine, spruce, birch,  and trembling little aspens up there among the stoutest. All were of  one height, clean-shaven by the volleys of the wind-driven sand and  pebbles that clipped off any treetop that aspired above the mass. In  solid numbers was their salvation, and they grew dense as grass, two  feet high on the battlefront. They were carved by that wind, for all  storms came here out of the west, and the storm face of every tree was  denuded of branches. To the east the foliage streamed away. Even in  calm weather those trees spoke of storm.    Bull Hunter sat up to put on his snowshoes. It was a white world below  him and above. Winter, which a day before had vanished, now came back  with a rush off the summits, where its snows were still piled. Again  the heart of the big man quaked. Down in the hollow, over that ridge,  was the house of the Campbells. They would be getting up now. Joe  would be making the fire, and Harry slicing the bacon. It made a  cheerful picture to Bull. He could close his eyes and hear the fire  snap and see the stove steam with smoke through every fissure before  the draft caught in the chimney. From the shed came the neigh of  Maggie, calling softly to him.    He shook his head with a groan, stood up, and strode out of the timber  into the summit lands. It was a great desert. Never could it be  construed as a place for life. Even lichens were almost out of place  here, and what folly could lead a man across the shifting snows? But  to be called a man, to be admired in silence, to be asked for  opinions, to be deferred to--this was a treasure worth any price! He  bowed himself to the wind again and made for the summit with the  peculiar stride which a man must use with snowshoes.    He dared not slacken his efforts now. The cold had been increasing,  and to pause meant peril of freezing. It was a highly electrified air,  and the result was a series of maddening mirages. He stumbled over  solid rocks where nothing seemed to be in his way; and again what  seemed a rock of huge size was nothing at all. Bull discovered that  what seemed firm ground beneath him, as he started to round a  precipice, might after all be the effect of the mirage.    Added to this was another difficulty. As he wound slowly, about  midday, up the last reach, with the summit just above him, the wind  carried masses of cloud over the crest and into his face. He walked  alternately in a bewildering, driving fog and then in an air made  crazy with electricity. Again and again, from one side or the other,  he started when the storm boomed and cannonaded down a ravine and then  belched out into the open. All this time the babel of the winds  overhead never ceased, and the force of the storm cut up under him  with such violence that he was almost raised from the earth.    Then an unexpected barrier obtruded--a literal mountain of ice was  before him. The snow of the recent fall had been whipped away, and the  surface of the mountain, here perilously steep, was now sleek and  solid with ice. Bull looked gloomily toward the summit so close above  him, and the ice glimmered in the dull light. There was only one way  to make even the attempt. He sat down, took off his snowshoes,  strapped them to his back, and began to work his way up the slope,  battering out each foothold with the head of his ax. It was possible  to ascend in this manner, but it would be practically impossible  to descend.    Once committed to this way, he had either to go on to the summit, or  else perish. Working slowly, with little possible muscular exercise to  warm him, he began to grow chilled and the wind-driven cold numbed his  ears. But, more than that, the wind was now a grim peril, for, from  time to time, it swerved and leaped on him heavily from the side.  Once, off balance, he looked back at the dazzling slope below him. He  would be a shapeless mass of flesh long before he tumbled to  the bottom.    Vaguely, as he hewed his footholds and worked his way up, he yearned  for the cleverness of Harry or the wit of Joe. What an ally either of  them would be! That he was undertaking a task from which either of  them would have shrunk in horror never occurred to him. Yonder, beyond  the summit, lay his destiny--Johnstown--and this was the way toward  it; it was a simple thing to Bull. He could no more vary from his  course than a magnetic needle can vary from its pole.    Suddenly he came on a break in the solid face of the ice. Above him  was a narrow rift through the ice to the gravel beneath; how it was  made, Bull could not guess. But he took advantage of it. Presently he  was striding on toward the summit, beating his hands to restore the  circulation and gingerly rubbing his ears.    There was a magical change as he reached the summit and sat down  behind some rocks to regain his breath and quiet his shaken nerves.  The clouds split apart in the zenith; the sun burst through; on both  sides the broad mountain billowed away to white lowlands; the air was  alive with little, brilliant spots of electricity.    It cheered Bull Hunter vastly. The gale, which was tumbling the clouds  down the arch of the sky and toward the east, was more mighty than  ever, but he put his head down to it confidently and began  the descent.          CHAPTER 5      There was more snow on this side, and to travel through it he soon  found that he must put on the snowshoes again; but after that the  descent was actually restful compared with the labors of the climb.  Yonder was the dark streak of the timberline again. Far down the  valley he watched it curving in and out along the mountainside like a  water level. Below was the darkness of the forest where"]]]
