Throwing her shawl  over her shoulders, for it was now late in the afternoon and growing  chilly, she walked downstairs and out into the Yard. She strolled  aimlessly to and fro awhile, and then went over to the fort and into  Captain Bogg's house, which adjoined the blockhouse. Here she found  Lydia preparing flax.    \"I saw you racing by on your pony. Goodness, how you can ride! I  should be afraid of breaking my neck,\" exclaimed Lydia, as Betty  entered.    \"My ride was spoiled,\" said Betty, petulantly.    \"Spoiled? By what--whom?\"    \"By a man, of course,\" retorted Betty, whose temper still was high.  \"It is always a man that spoils everything.\"    \"Why, Betty, what in the world do you mean? I never heard you talk  that way,\" said Lydia, opening her blue eyes in astonishment.    \"Well, Lyde, I'll tell you. I was riding down the river road and  just as I came to the end of the clearing a man jumped out from  behind some bushes and grasped Madcap's bridle. Imagine! For a  moment I was frightened out of my wits. I instantly thought of the  Girtys, who, I have heard, have evinced a fondness for kidnapping  little girls. Then the fellow said he was on guard and ordered me,  actually commanded me to go home.\"    \"Oh, is that all?\" said Lydia, laughing.    \"No, that is not all. He--he said I was a pretty little girl and  that he was sorry I could not have my own way; that his present  occupation was pleasant, and that the situation had its charm. The  very idea. He was most impertinent,\" and Betty's telltale cheeks  reddened again at the recollection.    \"Betty, I do not think your experience was so dreadful, certainly  nothing to put you out as it has,\" said Lydia, laughing merrily. \"Be  serious. You know we are out in the backwoods now and must not  expect so much of the men. These rough border men know little of  refinement like that with which you have been familiar. Some of them  are quiet and never speak unless addressed; their simplicity is  remarkable; Lew Wetzel and your brother Jonathan, when they are not  fighting Indians, are examples. On the other hand, some of them are  boisterous and if they get anything to drink they will make trouble  for you. Why, I went to a party one night after I had been here only  a few weeks and they played a game in which every man in the place  kissed me.\"    \"Gracious! Please tell me when any such games are likely to be  proposed and I'll stay home,\" said Betty.    \"I have learned to get along very well by simply making the best of  it,\" continued Lydia. \"And to tell the truth, I have learned to  respect these rugged fellows. They are uncouth; they have no  manners, but their hearts are honest and true, and that is of much  greater importance in frontiersmen than the little attentions and  courtesies upon which women are apt to lay too much stress.\"    \"I think you speak sensibly and I shall try and be more reasonable  hereafter. But, to return to the man who spoiled my ride. He, at  least, is no frontiersman, notwithstanding his gun and his buckskin  suit. He is an educated man. His manner and accent showed that. Then  he looked at me so differently. I know it was that soldier from Fort  Pitt.\"    \"Mr. Clarke? Why, of course!\" exclaimed Lydia, clapping her hands in  glee. \"How stupid of me!\"    \"You seem to be amused,\" said Betty, frowning.    \"Oh, Betty, it is such a good joke.\"    \"Is it? I fail to see it.\"    \"But I can. I am very much amused. You see, I heard Mr. Clarke say,  after papa told him there were lots of pretty girls here, that he  usually succeeded in finding those things out and without any  assistance. And the very first day he has met you and made you  angry. It is delightful.\"    \"Lyde, I never knew you could be so horrid.\"    \"It is evident that Mr. Clarke is not only discerning, but not  backward in expressing his thoughts. Betty, I see a romance.\"    \"Don't be ridiculous,\" retorted Betty, with an angry blush. \"Of  course, he had a right to stop me, and perhaps he did me a good turn  by keeping me inside the clearing, though I cannot imagine why he  hid behind the bushes. But he might have been polite. He made me  angry. He was so cool and--and--\"    \"I see,\" interrupted Lydia, teasingly. \"He failed to recognize your  importance.\"    \"Nonsense, Lydia. I hope you do not think I am a silly little fool.  It is only that I have not been accustomed to that kind of  treatment, and I will not have it.\"    Lydia was rather pleased that some one had appeared on the scene who  did not at once bow down before Betty, and therefore she took the  young man's side of the argument.    \"Do not be hard on poor Mr. Clarke. Maybe he mistook you for an  Indian girl. He is handsome. I am sure you saw that.\"    \"Oh, I don't remember how he looked,\" said Betty. She did remember,  but would not admit it.    The conversation drifted into other channels after this, and soon  twilight came stealing down on them. As Betty rose to go there came  a hurried tap on the door.    \"I wonder who would knock like that,\" said Lydia, rising \"Betty,  wait a moment while I open the door.\"    On doing this she discovered Clarke standing on the step with his  cap in his hand.    \"Why, Mr. Clarke! Will you come in?\" exclaimed Lydia. \"Thank you,  only for a moment,\" said Alfred. \"I cannot stay. I came to find  Betty. Is she here?\"    He had not observed Betty, who had stepped back into the shadow of  the darkening room. At his question Lydia became so embarrassed she  did not know what to say or do, and stood looking helplessly at him.    But Betty was equal to the occasion. At the mention of her first  name in such a familiar manner by this stranger, who had already  grievously offended her once before that day, Betty stood perfectly  still a moment, speechless with surprise, then she stepped quickly  out of the shadow.    Clarke turned as he heard her step and looked straight into a pair  of dark, scornful eyes and a face pale with anger.    \"If it be necessary that you use my name, and I do not see how that  can be possible, will you please have courtesy enough to say Miss  Zane?\" she cried haughtily.    Lydia recovered her composure sufficiently to falter out:    \"Betty, allow me to introduce--\"    \"Do not trouble yourself, Lydia. I have met this person once before  to-day, and I do not care for an introduction.\"    When Alfred found himself gazing into the face that had haunted him  all the afternoon, he forgot for the moment all about his errand. He  was finally brought to a realization of the true state of affairs by  Lydia's words.    \"Mr. Clarke, you are all wet. What has happened?\" she exclaimed,  noticing the water dripping from his garments.    Suddenly a light broke in on Alfred. So the girl he had accosted on  the road and \"Betty\" were one and the same person. His face flushed.  He felt that his rudeness on that occasion may have merited censure,  but that it had not justified the humiliation she had put upon him.    These two persons, so strangely brought together, and on whom Fate  had made her inscrutable designs, looked steadily into each other's  eyes. What mysterious force thrilled through Alfred Clarke and made  Betty Zane tremble?    \"Miss Boggs, I am twice unfortunate,\" said Alfred, tuning to Lydia,  and there was an earnest ring in his deep voice \"This time I am  indeed blameless. I have just left Colonel Zane's house, where there  has been an accident, and I was dispatched to find 'Betty,' being  entirely ignorant as to who she might be. Colonel Zane did not stop  to explain. Miss Zane is needed at the house, that is all.\"    And without so much as a glance at Betty he bowed low to Lydia and  then strode out of the open door.    \"What did he say?\" asked Betty, in a small trembling voice, all her  anger and resentment vanished.    \"There has been an accident. He did not say what or to whom. You  must hurry home. Oh, Betty, I hope no one has been hurt! And you  were very unkind to Mr. Clarke. I am sure he is a gentleman, and you  might have waited a moment to learn what he meant.\"    Betty did not answer, but flew out of the door and down the path to  the gate of the fort. She was almost breathless when she reached  Colonel Zane's house, and hesitated on the step before entering.  Summoning her courage she pushed open the door. The first thing that  struck her after the bright light was the pungent odor of strong  liniment. She saw several women neighbors whispering together. Major  McColloch and Jonathan Zane were standing by a couch over which Mrs.  Zane was bending. Colonel Zane sat at the foot of the couch. Betty  saw this in the first rapid glance, and then, as the Colonel's wife  moved aside, she saw a prostrate figure, a white face and dark eyes  that smiled at her.    \"Betty,\" came in a low voice from those pale lips.    Her heart leaped and then seemed to cease beating. Many long years  had passed since she had heard that voice, but it had never been  forgotten. It was the best beloved voice of her childhood, and with  it came the sweet memories of her brother and playmate. With a cry  of joy she fell on her knees beside him and threw her arms around  his neck.    \"Oh, Isaac, brother, brother!\" she cried, as she kissed him again  and again. \"Can it really be you? Oh, it is too good to be true!  Thank God! I have prayed and prayed that you would be restored to  us.\"    Then she began to cry and laugh at the same time in that strange way  in which a woman relieves a heart too full of joy. \"Yes, Betty. It  is all that is left of me,\" he said, running his hand caressingly  over the dark head that lay on his breast.    \"Betty, you must not excite him,\" said Colonel Zane.    \"So you have not forgotten me?\" whispered Isaac.    \"No, indeed, Isaac. I have never forgotten,\" answered Betty, softly.  \"Only last night I spoke of you and wondered if you were living. And  now you are here. Oh,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#6)"],[1,"of the Grand Canyon. We're across the Arizona  line now.\"    Hare followed the sweep of the ridge that rose to the eastward, but to  his inexperienced eyes its appearance carried no sense of its noble  proportions.    \"Don't form any ideas of distance and size yet a while,\" said Naab,  reading Hare's expression. \"They'd only have to be made over as soon as  you learn what light and air are in this country. It looks only half a  mile to the top of the divide; well, if we make it by midday we're  lucky. There, see a black spot over this way, far under the red wall?  Look sharp. Good! That's Holderness's ranch. It's thirty miles from  here. Nine Mile Valley heads in there. Once it belonged to Martin Cole.  Holderness stole it. And he's begun to range over the divide.\"    The sun rose and warmed the chill air. Hare began to notice the  increased height and abundance of the sagebrush, which was darker in  color. The first cedar-tree, stunted in growth, dead at the top, was the  half-way mark up the ascent, so Naab said; it was also the forerunner of  other cedars which increased in number toward the summit. At length  Hare, tired of looking upward at the creeping white wagons, closed his  eyes. The wheels crunched on the stones; the horses heaved and labored;  Naab's \"Getup\" was the only spoken sound; the sun beamed down warm, then  hot; and the hours passed. Some unusual noise roused Hare out of his  lethargy. The wagon was at a standstill. Naab stood on the seat with  outstretched arm. George and Dave were close by their mustangs, and Snap  Naab, mounted on a cream-colored pinto, reined him under August's arm,  and faced the valley below.    \"Maybe you'll make them out,\" said August. \"I can't, and I've watched  those dust-clouds for hours. George can't decide, either.\"    Hare, looking at Snap, was attracted by the eyes from which his father  and brothers expected so much. If ever a human being had the eyes of a  hawk Snap Naab had them. The little brown flecks danced in clear pale  yellow. Evidently Snap had not located the perplexing dust-clouds, for  his glance drifted. Suddenly the remarkable vibration of his pupils  ceased, and his glance grew fixed, steely, certain.    \"That's a bunch of wild mustangs,\" he said.    Hare gazed till his eyes hurt, but could see neither clouds of dust nor  moving objects. No more was said. The sons wheeled their mustangs and  rode to the fore; August Naab reseated himself and took up the reins;  the ascent proceeded.    But it proceeded leisurely, with more frequent rests. At the end of an  hour the horses toiled over the last rise to the summit and entered a  level forest of cedars; in another hour they were descending gradually.    \"Here we are at the tanks,\" said Naab.    Hare saw that they had come up with the other wagons. George Naab was  leading a team down a rocky declivity to a pool of yellow water. The  other boys were unharnessing and unsaddling.    \"About three,\" said Naab, looking at the sun. \"We're in good time. Jack,  get out and stretch yourself. We camp here. There's the Coconina Trail  where the Navajos go in after deer.\"    It was not a pretty spot, this little rock-strewn glade where the white  hard trail forked with the road. The yellow water with its green scum  made Hare sick. The horses drank with loud gulps. Naab and his sons  drank of it. The women filled a pail and portioned it out in basins and  washed their faces and hands with evident pleasure. Dave Naab whistled  as he wielded an axe vigorously on a cedar. It came home to Hare that  the tension of the past night and morning had relaxed. Whether to  attribute that fact to the distance from White Sage or to the arrival at  the water-hole he could not determine. But the certainty was shown in  August's cheerful talk to the horses as he slipped bags of grain over  their noses, and in the subdued laughter of the women. Hare sent up an  unspoken thanksgiving that these good Mormons had apparently escaped  from the dangers incurred for his sake. He sat with his back to a cedar  and watched the kindling of fires, the deft manipulating of biscuit  dough in a basin, and the steaming of pots. The generous meal was spread  on a canvas cloth, around which men and women sat cross-legged, after  the fashion of Indians. Hare found it hard to adapt his long legs to the  posture, and he wondered how these men, whose legs were longer than his,  could sit so easily. It was the crown of a cheerful dinner after hours  of anxiety and abstinence to have Snap Naab speak civilly to him, and to  see him bow his head meekly as his father asked the blessing. Snap ate  as though he had utterly forgotten that he had recently killed a man; to  hear the others talk to him one would suppose that they had forgotten it  also.    All had finished eating, except Snap and Dave Naab, when one of the  mustangs neighed shrilly. Hare would not have noticed it but for looks  exchanged among the men. The glances were explained a few minutes later  when a pattering of hoofs came from the cedar forest, and a stream of  mounted Indians poured into the glade.    The ugly glade became a place of color and action. The Navajos rode  wiry, wild-looking mustangs and drove ponies and burros carrying packs,  most of which consisted of deer-hides. Each Indian dismounted, and  unstrapping the blanket which had served as a saddle headed his mustang  for the water-hole and gave him a slap. Then the hides and packs were  slipped from the pack-train, and soon the pool became a kicking,  splashing melee. Every cedar-tree circling the glade and every branch  served as a peg for deer meat. Some of it was in the haunch, the bulk in  dark dried strips. The Indians laid their weapons aside. Every sagebush  and low stone held a blanket. A few of these blankets were of solid  color, most of them had bars of white and gray and red, the last color  predominating. The mustangs and burros filed out among the cedars,  nipping at the sage and the scattered tufts of spare grass. A group of  fires, sending up curling columns of blue smoke, and surrounded by a  circle of lean, half-naked, bronze-skinned Indians, cooking and eating,  completed a picture which afforded Hare the satisfying fulfilment of  boyish dreams. What a contrast to the memory of a camp-site on the  Connecticut shore, with boy friends telling tales in the glow of the  fire, and the wash of the waves on the beach!    The sun sank low in the west, sending gleams through the gnarled  branches of the cedars, and turning the green into gold. At precisely  the moment of sunset, the Mormon women broke into soft song which had  the element of prayer; and the lips of the men moved in silent harmony.  Dave Naab, the only one who smoked, removed his pipe for the moment's  grace to dying day.    This simple ceremony over, one of the boys put wood on the fire, and  Snap took a jews'-harp out of his pocket and began to extract doleful  discords from it, for which George kicked at him in disgust, finally  causing him to leave the circle and repair to the cedars, where he  twanged with supreme egotism.    \"Jack,\" said August Naab, \"our friends the Navajo chiefs, Scarbreast and  Eschtah, are coming to visit us. Take no notice of them at first.  They've great dignity, and if you entered their hogans they'd sit for  some moments before appearing to see you. Scarbreast is a war-chief.  Eschtah is the wise old chief of all the Navajos on the Painted Desert.  It may interest you to know he is Mescal's grandfather. Some day I'll  tell you the story.\"    Hare tried very hard to appear unconscious when two tall Indians stalked  into the circle of Mormons; he set his eyes on the white heart of the  camp-fire and waited. For several minutes no one spoke or even moved.  The Indians remained standing for a time; then seated themselves.  Presently August Naab greeted them in the Navajo language. This was a  signal for Hare to use his eyes and ears. Another interval of silence  followed before they began to talk. Hare could see only their blanketed  shoulders and black heads.    \"Jack, come round here,\" said Naab at length. \"I've been telling them  about you. These Indians do not like the whites, except my own family. I  hope you'll make friends with them.\"    \"How do?\" said the chief whom Naab had called Eschtah, a stately, keen-  eyed warrior, despite his age.    The next Navajo greeted him with a guttural word. This was a warrior  whose name might well have been Scarface, for the signs of conflict were  there. It was a face like a bronze mask, cast in the one expression of  untamed desert fierceness.    Hare bowed to each and felt himself searched by burning eyes, which were  doubtful, yet not unfriendly.    \"Shake,\" finally said Eschtah, offering his hand.    \"Ugh!\" exclaimed Scarbreast, extending a bare silver-braceleted arm.    This sign of friendship pleased Naab. He wished to enlist the sympathies  of the Navajo chieftains in the young man's behalf. In his ensuing  speech, which was plentifully emphasized with gestures, he lapsed often  into English, saying \"weak--no strong\" when he placed his hand on Hare's  legs, and \"bad\" when he touched the young man's chest, concluding with  the words \"sick--sick.\"    Scarbreast regarded Hare with great earnestness, and when Naab had  finished he said: \"Chineago--ping!\" and rubbed his hand over his  stomach.    \"He says you need meat--lots of deer-meat,\" translated Naab.    \"Sick,\" repeated Eschtah, whose English was intelligible. He appeared to  be casting about in his mind for additional words to express his  knowledge of the white man's tongue, and, failing, continued in Navajo:  \"Tohodena--moocha--malocha.\"    Hare was nonplussed at the roar of laughter from the Mormons. August  shook like a mountain in an earthquake.    \"Eschtah says, 'you hurry, get many squaws--many wives.'\"    Other Indians, russet-skinned warriors, with black hair held close by  bands round their foreheads,"]]]
