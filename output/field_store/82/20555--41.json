This happened in the spring of 1882.    Referring to our engraving, it will be seen that the wire rope rising  from the bed of the river passes first over a large guide pulley, the  axis of which is carried by a substantial wrought iron swinging bracket,  this bracket being so pivoted that while the pulley is free to swing  into the line on which the rope is approached by the vessel, yet the  rope on leaving the pulley is delivered in a line which is tangential to  a second guide pulley placed further aft and at a lower level. This last  named guide pulley does not swing, and from it the rope is delivered to  the clip drum, over which it passes. From the clip drum the rope passes  under a third guide pulley; this pulley swings on a bracket having a  vertical axis. This third pulley projects down below the keel of the tug  boat, so that the rope on leaving it can pass under the vessel without  fouling. Suitable recesses are formed in the side of the tug boat to  accommodate the swinging pulleys, while the bow of the boat is sloped  downward nearly to the water line, as shown, so as to allow of the  rising part of the rope swinging over it if necessary.    The hauling gear with which the tug is fitted consists of a pair of  condensing engines with cylinders 14.17 inches in diameter and 23.62  inches stroke, the crankshaft carrying a pinion which gears into a spur  wheel on an intermediate shaft, this shaft again carrying a pinion which  gears into a large spur wheel fixed on the shaft which carries the clip  drum. In the arrangement of hauling gear above described the ratio of  the gear is 1:8.44, in the case of tugs Nos. I. to IV.; while in tugs  Nos. V. to VIII. the proportion has been made 1:11.82. In tugs I. to IV.  the diameter of the clip drum is 2.743 meters (9 feet), while in the  remaining tugs it is 3.056 meters (10 feet).    From some interesting data which have been placed at our disposal by Mr.  Thomas Schwarz, the manager of the Central Actien-Gesellschaft fur  Tauerei und Schleppschifffahrt, we learn that in the tugs Nos. I. to IV.  the hauling machine develops on an average 150 indicated horse, while in  the tugs No. V. to VIII. the power developed averages 180 indicated  horse power. The tugs forming the first named group haul on an average  2,200 tons of cargo, contained in four wooden barges, at a speed of 41/2  kilometers (2.8 miles) per hour, against a stream running at the rate of  61/2 kilometers (4.05 miles) per hour, while the tugs Nos. V. to VIII.  will take a load of 2,600 tons of cargo in the same number of wooden  barges at the same speed and against the same current. In iron barges,  about one and a half times the quantity of useful load can be drawn by a  slightly less expenditure of power.    The average consumption of coal per hour is, for tugs Nos. I. to IV., 5  cwt, and for tugs Nos. V. to VIII., 6 cwt.; and of this fuel a small  fraction (about one-sixth) is consumed by the occasional working of the  screw propellers at sharp bends. The fuel consumption of the wire rope  tugs contrasts most favorably with that of the paddle and screw tugs  employed on the Rhine, the best paddle tugs (with compound engines,  patent wheels, etc.) burning three and a half times as much; the older  paddle tugs (with low pressure non-compound engines), four and a half  times as much; and the latest screw tugs, two and a half times as much  coal as the wire rope tugs when doing the same work under the same  circumstances. The screw tugs just mentioned have a draught of 21/2 meters  (8 feet 21/2 inches), and are fitted with engines of 560 indicated horse  power.    During the years 1879, 1880, and 1881, the company had in use fourteen  paddle tugs and ten eight-wire rope tugs, both classes being--owing to  the state of trade--about equally short of work. The results of the  working during these years were as follows:      ================================================================                    |       |  Freight   |  Cost of    | Degree                    |       |  hauled    |  haulage in |   of    Class of tugs.  | Year. |    in      |  pence per  | occupation.                    |       | ton-miles. |  ton-mile.  |    ----------------------------------------------------------------    Paddle          | 1879  | 31,862,858 |   0.1272    |  0.686      \"             | 1880  | 31,467,422 |   0.1305    |  0.638      \"             | 1881  | 28,627,049 |   0.1245    |  0.537    Wire Rope       | 1879  | 15,407,935 |   0.1167    |  0.614       \"            | 1880  | 17,289,706 |   0.1056    |  0.615       \"            | 1881  | 17,593,181 |   0.0893    |  0.536    ================================================================    The last column in the above tabular statement, headed \"Degree of  Occupation,\" may require some explanation. It is calculated on the  assumption that a tug could do 3,000 hours of work per annum, and this  is taken as the unit, the time of actual haulage being counted as full  time, and of stoppages as half time. The expenses included in the  statement of cost of haulage include all working expenses, repairs,  general management, and depreciation. The accounts for 1882, which are  not completely available at the time we are writing, show much better  results than above recorded, there being a considerable reduction of  cost, while the freight hauled amounted to a total of 54,921,965  ton-miles.    [Illustration: WIRE ROPE TUG BOAT, RIVER RHINE.]    As regards the wear of the rope, we may state that the relaying of the  first rope between St. Goar and Bingen was taken in hand in September,  1879, while that between Obercassel and Bingen was partially renewed the  same year, the renewal being completed in May, 1880, after the rope had  been in use since the beginning of 1876. The second rope between Bonn  and Bingen, a length of 743/4 miles, is of galvanized wire, has now been  23/4 years in use, during which time there have been but three fractures.  The first rope laid was not galvanized, and it suffered nine fractures  during the first three years of its use. The first rope, we may mention,  was laid in lengths of about a mile spliced together, while the present  rope was supplied in long lengths of 71/2 miles each, so that the number  of splices is greatly reduced. According to the report of the company  for the year 1880, the old rope when raised realizes about 16 per cent.  of its original value, and allowing for this, it is calculated that an  allowance of 18.7 per cent. per annum will cover the cost of rope  depreciation and renewals. Altogether the results obtained on the Rhine  show that in a rapid stream the economic performances of wire rope tugs  compare most favorably with those of either paddle or screw tug boats,  the more rapid the current to be contended against the greater being the  advantage of the wire rope haulage.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED HAY-ROPE MACHINE.      Hay-ropes are used for many purposes, their principal use being in the  foundry for core-making; but they also find a large application for  packing ironmongery and furniture. The inventor is James Pollard, of the  Atlas Foundry, Burnley.    [Illustration: HAY ROPE MACHINE.]    The chief part of the mechanism is carried in an open frame, having  journals attached to its two ends, which revolve in bearings. The frame  is driven by the rope pulley. The journal at the left hand is hollow;  the pinion upon it is stationary, being fixed to the bracket of bearing.  The pinion gearing into it is therefore revolved by the revolution of  the frame, and through the medium of bevel wheels actuates a transverse  shaft, parallel to which rollers, and driven by wheels off it, is a  double screw, which traverses a \"builder\" to and fro across the width of  frame. The builder is merely the eye through which the band passes, and  its office is to lay the band properly on the bobbin. The latter is  turned to coil on the band by a pitch chain from the builder screw, the  motion being given through a friction clutch, to allow for slip as the  bobbin or coil gets larger, for obviously the bobbin as it gets larger  is not required to turn so fast to coil up the band produced as when it  is smaller. If the action is studied, it will be seen that the twist is  put in between the bobbin and the hollow journal, and every revolution  of the frame puts in one turn for the twist. The hay is fed to the  machine through the hollow journal already mentioned. By suitably  proportioning the speed of feed-rollers and the revolutions of the  frame, which is easily accomplished by varying the wheels on the left  hand of frame, bands of any degree of hardness or softness may be  produced. The machine appears to be simple and not liable to get  deranged. It may be after a little practice attended to by a laborer,  and is claimed by its maker to be able to produce 400 yards of band per  hour. The frame makes about 180 revolutions per minute, that is, this is  the number of turns put into the twist in this time. The machine can  make a bundle about 200 yards long, which can be removed off the bobbin  without unwinding with the greatest facility.--_Mech.

The river Lee flows through the city of Cork in two branches, which  diverge just above the city, and are reunited at the Custom House, the  central portion of the city being situated upon an island between the  two arms of the river, both of which are navigable for a short distance  above the Custom House, and are lined with quays on each side for the  accommodation of the shipping of the port.    The Anglesea bridge crosses the south arm of the river about a quarter  of a mile above its junction with the northern branch, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11387"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

We observed two women looking out of a balcony, and earnestly beckoning  to us. We were the more surprised at their appearance, as we believed  that the Mahometan women of the Caucasus, like those of Persia, were  strictly confined to the interior of their houses, or that, at all  events, they never went unveiled, a custom which we found was not  general among the inhabitants of the Caucasus. We, however, entered the  house, and saw in the court two Russian grenadiers, who, by a mistake of  their corporal, had taken there quarters here, and whose presence was  the cause of the inquietude manifested by the two ladies, who, with an  old man, were the only inhabitants of the house. Whilst the soldiers  were explaining these things to us, they appeared at the top of the  stairs, and again renewed their invitation by violent gesticulations. On  a nearer approach, we guessed by their age that they were mother and  daughter. The former, who still preserved much of the freshness and  beauty of youth, wore very tight trousers, a short tunic, and a veil,  which fell in graceful folds on her back, while round her neck she had  some valuable jewels, though badly mounted. With respect to the  daughter, who was scarcely fifteen years of age, she was so  extraordinarily beautiful, that both my companion and myself remained  awhile motionless, and struck with admiration. Never in my life have I  seen a more perfect form. Her dress consisted of a short white tunic,  almost transparent, fastened only at the throat by a clasp. A veil,  negligently thrown over one shoulder, permitted part of her beautiful  ebony tresses to be seen. Her trousers were of an extremely fine tissue,  and her socks of the most delicate workmanship. The old man received us  in a room adjoining the staircase: he was seated on the carpet, smoking  a small pipe, according to the custom of the inhabitants of the  Caucasus, who cultivate tobacco. He made repeated signs to us to sit  down, that is to say, in the Asiatic manner, a posture extremely  inconvenient for those who, like ourselves, wore long and tight  trousers, whilst the two beautiful women on their side earnestly  seconded his request. We complied with it, though it was the first time  that either of us had made the essay. The ladies, having left the room  for a moment, returned with a salver of dried fruits, and a beverage  made of sugar and milk; but I was so much engaged in admiring their  personal attractions, that I paid but little attention to their  presents. It appeared to me an inconceivable caprice of nature to have  produced such prodigies of perfection amidst such a rude and barbarous  people, who value their women less than their stirrups. My companion,  who like myself was obliged to accept of their refreshments, remarked to  me, whilst the old man was conversing with them, what celebrity a woman  so transcendently beautiful as the daughter was would acquire in any of  the capitals of Europe, had she but received the benefits of a suitable  education.--_Van Halen's Narrative._           *       *       *       *       *      AUSTRALIAN IMPORTUNITY.      As beggars, the whole world will not produce their match. They do not  attempt to _coax_ you, but firmly rely on incessant importunity;  following you, side by side, from street to street, as constant as your  shadow, pealing in your ears the never ceasing sound of \"Massa, gim me a  dum! massa, gim me a dum!\" (dump.) If you have the fortitude to resist  _firmly_, on two or three assaults, you may enjoy ever after a life of  immunity; but by once _complying_, you entail yourself a plague which  you will not readily throw off, every gift only serving to embolden them  in making subsequent demands, and with still greater perseverance.  Neither are their wishes moderately gratified on this head--less than a  dump (fifteen pence) seldom proving satisfactory. When walking out one  morning, I accidentally met a young scion of our black tribes, on  turning the corner of the house, who saluted me with \"Good morning, sir,  good morning;\" to which I in like manner responded, and was proceeding  onwards, when my dingy acquaintance arrested my attention by his loud  vociferation of \"Top, sir, I want to peak to you.\" \"Well, what is it?\"  said I. \"Why, you know I am your _servant_, and you have never paid me  yet.\" \"The devil you are!\" responded I \"it is the first time I knew of  it, for I do not recollect ever seeing your face before.\" \"Oh yes, I  _am_ your servant,\" replied he, very resolutely; \"don't I top about  Massa ----'s, and boil the kettle sometimes for you in the morning?\" I  forthwith put my hand in my pocket, and gave him all the halfpence I  had, which I left him carefully counting, and proceeded on my walk; but  before advancing a quarter of a mile, my ears were again assailed with  loud shouts of \"Hallo! top, top!\" I turned round, and observed my friend  in \"the dark suit\" beckoning with his hand, and walking very leisurely  toward me. Thinking he was despatched with some message, I halted, but  as he walked on as slowly as if deeming I ought rather to go to him than  he come to me, I forthwith returned to meet him; but on reaching close  enough, what was my astonishment on his holding out the halfpence in his  open hand, and addressing me in a loud, grumbling, demanding tone  with--\"Why this is not enough to buy a loaf! you must give me more.\"  \"Then buy _half_ a loaf,\" said I, wheeling about and resuming my walk,  not without a good many hard epithets in return from my  kettle-boiler.--_Cunningham's Two Years in New South Wales_.           *       *       *       *       *      CONFESSION OF THE EXECUTIONER OF CHARLES I.      There have been great disputes about the person who beheaded Charles I.  Mr. Ellis says, \"it seems most probable that the person who actually  beheaded the king was the common executioner.\" And then adds the  following valuable and interesting note, which seems to us to settle the  question.    \"Among the tracts relating to the civil war, which were given to the  British Museum by his late majesty King George III. in 1762, there are  three upon this subject. One is entitled, 'The Confession of Richard  Brandon the Hangman (upon his death-bed), concerning his beheading his  late Majesty. Printed in the year of the hangman's downfall, 1649.' The  second is entitled, 'The last Will and Testament of Richard Brandon,'  printed in the same year. The third is, 'A Dialogue or Dispute between  the late Hangman (the same person), and Death,' in verse, without date.  All three are in quarto.\"    The following are the most important paragraphs of the first tract:    \"The confession of the hangman concerning his beheading his late majesty  the king of Great Britain (upon his death-bed) who was buried on  Thursday last in Whitechapel church-yard, with the manner thereof:--    \"Upon Wednesday last (being the 20th of this instant, June 1649),  Richard Brandon, the late executioner and hangman, who beheaded his late  majesty, king of Great Britain, departed this life; but during the time  of his sicknesse his conscience was much troubled, and exceedingly  perplexed in mind, yet little shew of repentance for remission of his  sins, and by past transgressions, which had so much power and influence  upon him, that he seemed to live in them, and they in him. And on Sunday  last, a young man of his acquaintance going to visit him, fell into  discourse, asked him how he did, and whether he was not troubled in  conscience for cutting off the king's head. He replyed, 'yes, by reason  that (upon the time of his tryall, and at the denouncing of sentence  against him,) he had taken a vow and protestation, wishing God to punish  him body and soul, if ever he appeared on the scaffold to do the act, or  lift up his hand against him.'    \"He likewise confessed that he had thirty pounds for his pains, all paid  him in half-crowns, within an hour after the blow was given; and that he  had an orange stuck full of cloves, and a handkircher out of the king's  pocket, so soon as he was carried off from the scaffold, for which  orange he was proffered twenty shillings by a gentleman in Whitehall,  but refused"]]]
