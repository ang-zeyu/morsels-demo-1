And what though doom'd to shores so far apart    From England's home, that ev'n the home-sick heart    Quails, thinking, ere that gulf can be recross'd,    How large a space of fleeting life is lost:    Yet there, by time, their bosoms shall be changed,    And strangers once shall cease to sigh estranged,    But jocund in the year's long sunshine roam,    That yields their sickle twice its harvest home.

The grey-haired swain, his grandchild sporting round,    Shall walk at eve his little empire's bound,    Emblazed with ruby vintage, ripening corn,    And verdant rampart of Acacian thorn,    While, mingling with the scent his pipe exhales,    The orange-grove's and fig-tree's breath prevails;    Survey with pride beyond a monarch's spoil,    His honest arm's own subjugated soil;    And summing all the blessings God has given,    Put up his patriarchal prayer to Heaven,    That when his bones shall here repose in peace,    The scions of his love may still increase,    And o'er a land where life has ample room,    In health and plenty innocently bloom.

And all but brute or reptile life is dumb!    Land of the free! thy kingdom is to come,    Of states, with laws from Gothic bondage burst,    And creeds by charter'd priesthood's unaccurst;    Of navies, hoisting their emblazon'd flags,    Where shipless seas now wash unbeacon'd crags;    Of hosts review'd in dazzling files and squares,    Their pennon'd trumpets breathing native airs,    For minstrels thou shalt have of native fire.    And maids to sing the songs themselves inspire;    Our very speech, methinks, in after time.

How many a name, to us uncouthly wild,    Shall thrill that region's patriotic child,    And bring as sweet thoughts o'er his bosom's chords,    As aught that's named in song to us affords!    Dear shall that river's margin be to him,    Where sportive first he bathed his boyish limb.    Or petted birds, still brighter than their bowers,    Or twin'd his tame young kangaroo with flowers.    But mere magnetic yet to memory    Shall be the sacred spot, still blooming nigh,    The bower of love, where first his bosom burn'd,    And smiling passion saw its smile return'd.

Conversation, like a shuttlecock, should not be suffered to remain with one  person, but ought to pass in turn to all. But as few people think for  themselves, so few people talk for themselves, and a colloquial monopoly is  as common and as disagreeable as any other. Yet when we observe how much  these rattles are caressed, 'tis wonderful there are so few. Talent is by  no means indispensable, and is the more valuable in proportion as it is  flimsy or superficial. The great art lies in the choice of a subject. Let  it be some _liaison_ in the _beau monde_--the appearance of a new singer or  actress--the detail of a recent duel, with particulars and embellishments,  and your fortune is made at once. Do not affect any thing like a literary  character, for scholars are reckoned _bores_. The only matters of this sort  with which you can safely meddle are the fashionable novels--satirical  poems--the magazines, and newspapers (eschewing the political articles as  vulgar). It is absolutely necessary to be familiar with the names of all  the editors in town, and these can easily be picked up from any of the  tatterdemalions who prowl about police offices for the purpose of reporting  the trials at a penny per line, which is, in most cases, exactly a penny  per line too much. You must drop the complimentary _Mr._, and say, \"A. of  the Chronicle and I--the last time I saw B. of the Globe--C. of the  Spectator told me t'other day,\" and so on. Of course it is not of the  slightest consequence whether you ever saw one of the parties. You must  also affect to be intimate with the theatrical _lions_, and be aware of the  true state of all managerial squabbles for the season. Swear you have dined  a dozen times with Sontag. _En passant_, the idea of a singer's patronizing  a nation _wholesale_, as she has done in the case of the Silesians, is  rather too good. Be indignant with Price for forfeiting Ellen Tree three  several times in the sum of thirty pounds, and suppress the fact of his  having remitted the penalty in the two first instances. Assume a mysterious  air of \"I could if I would,\" when Miss Love's elopement is mentioned, and  state with heroic confidence that the Vesuvius scene in \"Masaniello\" at  Astley's beat Drury by thirteen bricks and two ounces of Greek fire. You  must pretend to know the salaries of all the _employes_ in every  establishment, and be able to describe the plot of every new piece the  moment it is underlined. You can obtain sufficient information to enable  you to pass muster on this subject any evening at the Garrick's Head. It  would be of great service if you could contrive to be seen in conversation  with a respectable actor now and then. You must have seen every sight and  exhibited at every exhibition in town, and be able to discuss their several  merits or demerits with a \"learned spirit.\" A knowledge of the principal  nobility--by person at least--is a _sine qua non_, for how else should you  be able to recount the names of those you saw in the Park on Sunday last?  Keep a list of the ages and portions of as many young ladies as possible,  and be cautious how you dispose of your information on this score. These, I  think, are the principal topics; and the best advice I can give is, \"Never  be quiet: speak on _ad infinitum_.\"    The man who inwardly digests these rules will be a treasure at any dinner  party. The awful silence which prevails on the removal of the  tablecloth--and an awful silence it surely is--will be dispelled. No  ordinary man thinks of speaking, except in monosyllables, till he gets a  little \"elevated,\" and then he speaks nonsense as a matter of course. _You_  must keep sober--for people will occasionally get \"mellow,\" even in good  society--and this you will easily manage to do by thinking of the immense  superiority you will thus secure on joining the ladies in the drawing-room.  You will be able to hand some blushing fair her coffee without pitching cup  and contents into her lap, and stoop to pick up her fan or handkerchief  without incurring the risk of breaking your nose. Should quadrilles be  proposed, you will also be able to avoid those little _dos-a-dos_ accidents  which are by no means agreeable, and be qualified to pronounce, with  tolerable certainty, which is your own partner.    _Sharpe's Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.           *       *       *       *       *      VIDOCQ.      Some very pleasant blunderer is said to have declared Moore's Life of  Sheridan to be the best piece of _Autobiography_ he had ever read; and with  little more propriety can the concluding volume of _Vidocq's Memoirs_ be  said to belong to that species of literature styled Autobiography. The  early volumes, however, possessed this feature, but the present is little  more than a criminal supplement to the Memoirs. Of this defect, the  translator seems to be aware; for in his \"Sequel,\" he says, instead of the  important disclosures promised by the Police Agent, in vol. ii., \"he has  given us a nomenclature of the assassins, thieves, and swindlers of France,  and no more.\" He has merely brought down his Memoirs to the year 1816, and  eked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#6)"],[1,"chaps, whom he fags, look up to him  as a great hero. And there isn't one in our part of the school who can  thrash him. Besides, people never do interfere, you know--at least not  often. I remember once seeing a street-row in London, at which twenty  people stood by, and let a drunken beast of a husband strike his wife  without ever stirring to defend her.\"    \"Well,\" sighed Eric, \"I hope my day of deliverance will come soon, for  I can't stand it much longer, and 'tell' I won't, whatever Owen may do.\"    Eric's deliverance came very soon. It was afternoon; the boys were  playing at different games in the green playground, and he was waiting  for his turn at rounders. At this moment Barker lounged up, and calmly  snatching off Eric's cap, shied it over Dr. Rowlands' garden wall.  \"There, go and fetch that.\"    \"You blackguard!\" said Eric, standing irresolutely for a few minutes;  and then with tears in his eyes began to climb the wall. It was not very  high, but boys were peremptorily forbidden to get over it under any  circumstances, and Eric broke the rule not without trepidation. However,  he dropped down on one of Mrs. Rowlands' flower-beds, and got his cap in  a hurry, and clambered back undiscovered.    He thought this would have satisfied his tormentor for one day; but  Barker was in a mischievous mood, so he again came up to Eric, and  calling out, \"Who'll have a game at football?\" again snatched the cap,  and gave it a kick; Eric tried to recover it, but every time he came up  Barker gave it a fresh kick, and finally kicked it into a puddle.    Eric stood still, trembling with rage, while his eyes lightened scorn  and indignation. \"You hulking, stupid, cowardly bully,\"--here Barker  seized him, and every word brought a tremendous blow on the head, but  blind with passion Eric went on--\"you despicable bully, I won't touch  that cap again, you shall pick it up yourself. Duncan, Russell, here! do  help me against this intolerable brute.\"    Several boys ran up, but they were all weaker than Barker, who besides  was now in a towering fury, and kicked Eric unmercifully.    \"Leave him alone,\" shouted Duncan, \"or by heaven I'll get you a sound  thrashing from some fellow.\"    \"I won't; mind your own business,\" growled Barker, shaking himself free  from Duncan's hand.    \"Barker, I'll never speak to you again from this day,\" said Montagu,  turning on his heel with a look of withering contempt.    \"What do I care? puppy, you want taking down too,\" was the reply, and  some more kicks at Eric followed.    \"Barker, I won't stand this any longer,\" said Russell; and seizing him  by the arm, he dealt him a swinging blow on the face.    The bully stood in amazement, and dropped Eric, who fell on the turf  nearly fainting, and bleeding at the nose. But now Russell's turn came,  and in a moment Barker, who was twice his weight, had tripped him up,  when he found himself collared in an iron grasp.    There had been an unobserved spectator of the whole scene, in the person  of Mr. Williams himself, and it was his strong hand that now griped  Barker's shoulder. He was greatly respected by the boys, who all knew  his tall handsome figure by sight, and he frequently stood a quiet and  pleased observer of their games. The boys in the playground came  crowding round, and Barker in vain struggled to escape. Mr. Williams  held him firmly, and said in a calm voice, \"I have just seen you treat  one of your schoolfellows with the grossest violence. It makes me blush  for you, Roslyn Boys,\" he continued, turning to the group that  surrounded him, \"that you can stand by unmoved, and see such things  done. You know that you despise any one who tells a master, yet you  allow this bullying to go on, and that, too, without any provocation.  Now, mark; it makes no difference that the boy hurt is my own son; I  would have punished this scoundrel, whoever it had been, and I shall  punish him now.\" With these words he lifted the riding-whip which he  happened to be carrying, and gave Barker one of the most satisfactory  castigations he had ever undergone; the boys declared that Dr. Rowlands'  \"swishings\" were nothing to it. Mr. Williams saw that the offender was a  tough subject, and determined that he should not soon forget the  punishment he then received. He had never heard from Eric how this boy  had been treating him, but he had heard it from Russell, and now he had  seen one of the worst specimens of it with his own eyes. He therefore  belabored him till his sullen obstinacy gave way to a roar for mercy,  and promises never so to offend again.    At this crisis he flung the boy from him with a \"phew\" of disgust, and  said, \"I give nothing for your word; but if ever you do bully in this  way again, and I see or hear of it, your present punishment shall be a  trifle to what I shall then administer. At present, thank me for not  informing your master.\" So saying, he made Barker pick up the cap, and,  turning away, walked home with Eric leaning on his arm.    Barker, too, carried himself off with the best grace be could; but it  certainly didn't mend matters when he heard numbers of fellows, even  little boys, say openly, \"I'm so glad; serves you right.\"    From that day Eric was never troubled with personal violence from Barker  or any other boy. But rancor smouldered deep in the mind of the baffled  tyrant, and, as we shall see hereafter, there are subtler means of  making an enemy wretched than striking or kicking him.        CHAPTER IV    CRIBBING         \"Et nos ergo manum forulae subduximus.\"--Juv. i. 15.    It must not be thought that Eric's year as a home boarder was made up of  dark experiences. Roslyn had a very bright as well as a dark side, and  Eric enjoyed it \"to the finger-tips.\" School-life, like all other life,  is an April day of shower and sunshine. Its joys may be more childish,  its sorrows more trifling than those of after years;--but they are more  keenly felt.    And yet, although we know it to be a mere delusion, we all idealise and  idolise our childhood. The memory of it makes pleasant purple in the  distance, and as we look back on the sunlight of its blue far-off hills,  we forget how steep we sometimes found them.    After Barker's discomfiture, which took place some three weeks after his  arrival, Eric liked the school more and more, and got liked by it more  and more. This might have been easily foreseen, for he was the type of a  thoroughly boyish mind in its more genial and honorable characteristics,  and his round of acquaintances daily increased. Among others, a few of  the sixth, who were also day-scholars, began to notice and walk home  with him. He looked on them as great heroes, and their condescension  much increased his dignity both in his own estimation and that of  his equals.    Now, too, he began to ask some of his most intimate acquaintances to  spend an evening with him sometimes at home. This was a pleasure much  coveted, for no boy ever saw Mrs. Williams without loving her, and they  felt themselves humanised by the friendly interest of a lady who  reminded every boy of his own mother. Vernon, too, now a lively and  active child of nine, was a great pet among them, so that every one  liked Eric who \"knew him at home.\" A boy generally shows his best side  at home; the softening shadows of a mother's tender influence play over  him, and tone down the roughness of boyish character. Duncan, Montagu,  and Owen were special favorites in the home circle, and Mrs. Williams  felt truly glad that her son had singled out friends who seemed, on the  whole, so desirable. But Montagu and Russell were the most frequent  visitors, and the latter became almost like one of the family; he won so  much on all their hearts that Mrs. Williams was not surprised when Eric  confided to her one day that he loved Russell almost as well as be  loved Vernon.    As Christmas approached, the boys began to take a lively interest in the  half-year's prizes, and Eric was particularly eager about them. He had  improved wonderfully, and as both his father and mother prevented him  from being idle, even had he been so inclined, he had soon shown that  he was one of the best in the form. Two prizes were given, half-yearly  to each remove; one for \"marks\" indicating the boy who had generally  been highest throughout the half year, and the other for the test proofs  of proficiency in a special examination. It was commonly thought in the  form that Owen would get the first of these prizes, and Eric the other;  and towards the approach of the examination, he threw his whole energy  into the desire to win. The desire was not selfish. Some ambition was of  course natural; but he longed for the prize chiefly for the delight  which he knew his success would cause at Fairholm, and still more to his  own family.    During the last week, an untoward circumstance happened, which, while it  increased his popularity, diminished a good deal (as he thought) his  chance of success. The fourth form were learning a Homer lesson, and  Barker, totally unable to do it by his own resources, was trying to  borrow a crib. Eric, much to their mutual disgust, still sat next to him  in school, and would have helped him if he had chosen to ask; but he  never did choose, nor did Eric care to volunteer. The consequence was,  that unless he could borrow a crib, he was invariably turned, and he was  now particularly anxious to get one, because the time was nearly up.    There was a certain idle, good-natured boy, named Llewellyn, who had  \"cribs\" to every book they did, and who, with a pernicious _bonhommie,_  lent them promiscuously to the rest, all of whom were only too glad to  avail themselves of the help, except the few at the top of the form, who  found it a slovenly way of learning the lesson, which was sure to get  them into worse difficulties than an honest attempt to master the  meaning for themselves.
