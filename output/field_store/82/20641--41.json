(_Loc. sigill._)      \"To the priests deputed from the Temple Sengakuji,        His Reverence SEKISHI,        His Reverence ICHIDON.\"    The second paper is a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of  which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men:--       \"Last year, in the third month, Asano Takumi no Kami, upon the     occasion of the entertainment of the Imperial ambassador, was     driven, by the force of circumstances, to attack and wound my     Lord Kotsuke no Suke in the castle, in order to avenge an     insult offered to him. Having done this without considering the     dignity of the place, and having thus disregarded all rules of     propriety, he was condemned to _hara-kiri,_ and his property     and castle of Ako were forfeited to the State, and were     delivered up by his retainers to the officers deputed by the     Shogun to receive them. After this his followers were all     dispersed. At the time of the quarrel the high officials     present prevented Asano Takumi no Kami from carrying out his     intention of killing his enemy, my Lord Kotsuke no Suke. So     Asano Takumi no Kami died without having avenged himself, and     this was more than his retainers could endure. It is impossible     to remain under the same heaven with the enemy of lord or     father; for this reason we have dared to declare enmity against     a personage of so exalted rank. This day we shall attack Kira     Kotsuke no Suke, in order to finish the deed of vengeance which     was begun by our dead lord. If any honourable person should     find our bodies after death, he is respectfully requested to     open and read this document.       \"15th year of Genroku. 12th month.       \"Signed, OISHI KURANOSUKE, Retainer of Asano     Takumi no Kami, and forty-six others.\"[6]    [Footnote 6: It is usual for a Japanese, when bent upon some deed of  violence, the end of which, in his belief, justifies the means, to  carry about with him a document, such as that translated above, in  which he sets forth his motives, that his character may be cleared  after death.]    The third manuscript is a paper which the Forty-seven Ronins laid upon  the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira Kotsuke no  Suke:--       \"The 15th year of Genroku, the 12th month, and 15th day. We     have come this day to do homage here, forty-seven men in all,     from Oishi Kuranosuke down to the foot-soldier, Terasaka     Kichiyemon, all cheerfully about to lay down our lives on your     behalf. We reverently announce this to the honoured spirit of     our dead master. On the 14th day of the third month of last     year our honoured master was pleased to attack Kira Kotsuke no     Suke, for what reason we know not. Our honoured master put an     end to his own life, but Kira Kotsuke no Suke lived. Although     we fear that after the decree issued by the Government this     plot of ours will be displeasing to our honoured master, still     we, who have eaten of your food, could not without blushing     repeat the verse, 'Thou shalt not live under the same heaven     nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,'     nor could we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves     before you in paradise, unless we had carried out the vengeance     which you began. Every day that we waited seemed as three     autumns to us. Verily, we have trodden the snow for one day,     nay, for two days, and have tasted food but once. The old and     decrepit, the sick and ailing, have come forth gladly to lay     down their lives. Men might laugh at us, as at grasshoppers     trusting in the strength of their arms, and thus shame our     honoured lord; but we could not halt in our deed of vengeance.     Having taken counsel together last night, we have escorted my     Lord Kotsuke no Suke hither to your tomb. This dirk,[7] by     which our honoured lord set great store last year, and     entrusted to our care, we now bring back. If your noble spirit     be now present before this tomb, we pray you, as a sign, to     take the dirk, and, striking the head of your enemy with it a     second time, to dispel your hatred for ever. This is the     respectful statement of forty-seven men.\"    [Footnote 7: The dirk with which Asano Takumi no Kumi disembowelled  himself and with which Oishi Kuranosuke cut off Kotsuke no Suke's  head.]    The text, \"Thou shalt not live under the same heaven with the enemy of  thy father,\" is based upon the Confucian books. Dr. Legge, in his  \"Life and Teachings of Confucius,\" p. 113, has an interesting  paragraph summing up the doctrine of the sage upon the subject of  revenge.       \"In the second book of the 'Le Ke' there is the following     passage:--'With the slayer of his father a man may not live     under the same heaven; against the slayer of his brother a man     must never have to go home to fetch a weapon; with the slayer     of his friend a man may not live in the same State.' The _lex     talionis_ is here laid down in its fullest extent. The 'Chow     Le' tells us of a provision made against the evil consequences     of the principle by the appointment of a minister called 'The     Reconciler.' The provision is very inferior to the cities of     refuge which were set apart by Moses for the manslayer to flee     to from the fury of the avenger. Such as it was, however, it     existed, and it is remarkable that Confucius, when consulted on     the subject, took no notice of it, but affirmed the duty of     blood-revenge in the strongest and most unrestricted terms. His     disciple, Tsze Hea, asked him, 'What course is to be pursued in     the murder of a father or mother?' He replied, 'The son must     sleep upon a matting of grass with his shield for his pillow;     he must decline to take office; he must not live under the same     heaven with the slayer. When he meets him in the market-place     or the court, he must have his weapon ready to strike him.'     'And what is the course in the murder of a brother?' 'The     surviving brother must not take office in the same State with     the slayer; yet, if he go on his prince's service to the State     where the slayer is, though he meet him, he must not fight with     him.' 'And what is the course in the murder of an uncle or     cousin?' 'In this case the nephew or cousin is not the     principal. If the principal, on whom the revenge devolves, can     take it, he has only to stand behind with his weapon in his     hand, and support him.'\"    I will add one anecdote to show the sanctity which is attached to the  graves of the Forty-seven. In the month of September 1868, a certain  man came to pray before the grave of Oishi Chikara. Having finished  his prayers, he deliberately performed _hara-kiri_,[8] and, the belly  wound not being mortal, dispatched himself by cutting his throat. Upon  his person were found papers setting forth that, being a Ronin and  without means of earning a living, he had petitioned to be allowed to  enter the clan of the Prince of Choshiu, which he looked upon as the  noblest clan in the realm; his petition having been refused, nothing  remained for him but to die, for to be a Ronin was hateful to him, and  he would serve no other master than the Prince of Choshiu: what more  fitting place could he find in which to put an end to his life than  the graveyard of these Braves? This happened at about two hundred  yards' distance from my house, and when I saw the spot an hour or two  later, the ground was all bespattered with blood, and disturbed by the  death-struggles of the man.    [Footnote 8: A purist in Japanese matters may object to the use of the  words _hara-kiri_ instead of the more elegant expression _Seppuku_. I  retain the more vulgar form as being better known, and therefore more  convenient.]          THE LOVES OF GOMPACHI AND KOMURASAKI      Within two miles or so from Yedo, and yet well away from the toil and  din of the great city, stands the village of Meguro. Once past the  outskirts of the town, the road leading thither is bounded on either  side by woodlands rich in an endless variety of foliage, broken at  intervals by the long, low line of villages and hamlets. As we draw  near to Meguro, the scenery, becoming more and more rustic, increases  in beauty. Deep shady lanes, bordered by hedgerows as luxurious as any  in England, lead down to a valley of rice fields bright with the  emerald green of the young crops. To the right and to the left rise  knolls of fantastic shape, crowned with a profusion of Cryptomerias,  Scotch firs and other cone-bearing trees, and fringed with thickets of  feathery bamboos, bending their stems gracefully to the light summer  breeze. Wherever there is a spot shadier and pleasanter to look upon  than the rest, there may be seen the red portal of a shrine which the  simple piety of the country folk has raised to Inari Sama, the patron  god of farming, or to some other tutelary deity of the place. At the  eastern outlet of the valley a strip of blue sea bounds the horizon;  westward are the distant mountains. In the foreground, in front of a  farmhouse, snug-looking, with its roof of velvety-brown thatch, a  troop of sturdy urchins, suntanned and stark naked, are frisking in  the wildest gambols, all heedless of the scolding voice of the  withered old grandam who sits spinning and minding the house, while  her son and his wife are away toiling at some outdoor labour. Close at  our feet runs a stream of pure water, in which a group of countrymen  are washing the vegetables which they will presently shoulder and  carry off to sell by auction in the suburbs of Yedo. Not the least  beauty of the scene consists in the wondrous clearness of an  atmosphere so transparent that the most distant outlines are scarcely  dimmed, while the details of the nearer ground stand out in sharp,  bold relief,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#6)"],[1,"on, whose selection seems to have been determined by  the coat. All books without covers were thrown into a great heap, and  condemned to all the purposes which Leland laments in the sack of the  conventual libraries by the visitors. But they found favour in the eyes  of a literate gardener, who begged leave to take what he liked home.  He selected a large quantity of Sermons preached before the House of  Commons, local pamphlets, tracts from 1680 to 1710, opera books, etc.  He made a list of them, which I found afterwards in the cottage. In  the list, No. 43 was 'Cotarmouris,' or the Boke of St. Albans. The old  fellow was something of a herald, and drew in his books what he held  to be his coat. After his death, all that could be stuffed into a large  chest were put away in a garret; but a few favourites, and the 'Boke'  among them remained on the kitchen shelves for years, till his son's  widow grew so 'stalled' of dusting them that she determined to sell  them. Had she been in poverty, I should have urged the buyer, Stark, the  duty of giving her a small sum out of his great gains.\"    Such chances as this do not fall to a man's lot twice; but Edmond Werdet  relates a story very similar indeed, and where also the \"plums\" fell  into the lap of a London dealer.    In 1775, the Recollet Monks of Antwerp, wishing to make a reform,  examined their library, and determined to get rid of about 1,500  volumes--some manuscript and some printed, but all of which they  considered as old rubbish of no value.    At first they were thrown into the gardener's rooms; but, after some  months, they decided in their wisdom to give the whole refuse to the  gardener as a recognition of his long services.    This man, wiser in his generation than these simple fathers, took the  lot to M. Vanderberg, an amateur and man of education. M. Vanderberg  took a cursory view, and then offered to buy them by weight at sixpence  per pound. The bargain was at once concluded, and M. Vanderberg had the  books.    Shortly after, Mr. Stark, a well-known London bookseller, being in  Antwerp, called on M. Vanderberg, and was shown the books. He at once  offered 14,000 francs for them, which was accepted. Imagine the surprise  and chagrin of the poor monks when they heard of it! They knew they had  no remedy, and so dumbfounded were they by their own ignorance, that  they humbly requested M. Vanderberg to relieve their minds by returning  some portion of his large gains. He gave them 1,200 francs.    The great Shakespearian and other discoveries, which were found in a  garret at Lamport Hall in 1867 by Mr. Edmonds, are too well-known and  too recent to need description. In this case mere chance seems to have  led to the preservation of works, the very existence of which set the  ears of all lovers of Shakespeare a-tingling.    In the summer of 1877, a gentleman with whom I was well acquainted took  lodgings in Preston Street, Brighton. The morning after his arrival,  he found in the w.c. some leaves of an old black-letter book. He asked  permission to retain them, and enquired if there were any more where  they came from. Two or three other fragments were found, and the  landlady stated that her father, who was fond of antiquities, had at one  time a chest full of old black-letter books; that, upon his death, they  were preserved till she was tired of seeing them, and then, supposing  them of no value, she had used them for waste; that for two years and  a-half they had served for various household purposes, but she had  just come to the end of them. The fragments preserved, and now in my  possession, are a goodly portion of one of the most rare books from the  press of Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor. The title is a curious  woodcut with the words \"Gesta Romanorum\" engraved in an odd-shaped black  letter. It has also numerous rude wood-cuts throughout. It was from this  very work that Shakespeare in all probability derived the story of the  three caskets which in \"The Merchant of Venice\" forms so integral a  portion of the plot. Only think of that cloaca being supplied daily with  such dainty bibliographical treasures!    In the Lansdowne Collection at the British Museum is a volume containing  three manuscript dramas of Queen Elizabeth's time, and on a fly-leaf  is a list of fifty-eight plays, with this note at the foot, in the  handwriting of the well-known antiquary, Warburton:      \"After I had been many years collecting these Manuscript Playes, through  my own carelessness and the ignorance of my servant, they was unluckely  burned or put under pye bottoms.\"      Some of these \"Playes\" are preserved in print, but others are quite  unknown and perished for ever when used as \"pye-bottoms.\"    Mr. W. B. Rye, late Keeper of the Printed Books at our great National  Library, thus writes:--      \"On the subject of ignorance you should some day, when at the British  Museum, look at Lydgate's translation of Boccaccio's 'Fall of Princes,'  printed by Pynson in 1494. It is 'liber rarissimus.' This copy when  perfect had been very fine and quite uncut. On one fine summer afternoon  in 1874 it was brought to me by a tradesman living at Lamberhurst. Many  of the leaves had been cut into squares, and the whole had been rescued  from a tobacconist's shop, where the pieces were being used to wrap up  tobacco and snuff. The owner wanted to buy a new silk gown for his wife,  and was delighted with three guineas for this purpose. You will notice  how cleverly the British Museum binder has joined the leaves, making it,  although still imperfect, a fine book.\"      Referring to the carelessness exhibited by some custodians of Parish  Registers,    Mr. Noble, who has had great experience in such matters, writes:--      \"A few months ago I wanted a search made of the time of Charles I in  one of the most interesting registers in a large town (which shall be  nameless) in England. I wrote to the custodian of it, and asked him  kindly to do the search for me, and if he was unable to read the names  to get some one who understood the writing of that date to decipher the  entries for me. I did not have a reply for a fortnight, but one morning  the postman brought me a very large unregistered book-packet, which I  found to be the original Parish Registers! He, however, addressed a note  with it stating that he thought it best to send me the document itself  to look at, and begged me to be good enough to return the Register to  him as soon as done with. He evidently wished to serve me--his ignorance  of responsibility without doubt proving his kindly disposition, and on  that account alone I forbear to name him; but I can assure you I was  heartily glad to have a letter from him in due time announcing that  the precious documents were once more locked up in the parish chest.  Certainly, I think such as he to be 'Enemies of books.' Don't you?\"      Bigotry has also many sins to answer for. The late M. Muller, of  Amsterdam, a bookseller of European fame, wrote to me as follows a few  weeks before his death:--      \"Of course, we also, in Holland, have many Enemies of books, and if I  were happy enough to have your spirit and style I would try and write  a companion volume to yours. Now I think the best thing I can do is  to give you somewhat of my experience. You say that the discovery of  printing has made the destruction of anybody's books difficult. At this  I am bound to say that the Inquisition did succeed most successfully, by  burning heretical books, in destroying numerous volumes invaluable for  their wholesome contents. Indeed, I beg to state to you the amazing fact  that here in Holland exists an Ultramontane Society called 'Old  Paper,' which is under the sanction of the six Catholic Bishops of the  Netherlands, and is spread over the whole kingdom. The openly-avowed  object of this Society is to buy up and to destroy as waste paper all  the Protestant and Liberal Catholic newspapers, pamphlets and books,  the price of which is offered to the Pope as 'Deniers de St. Pierre.'  Of course, this Society is very little known among Protestants, and  many have denied even its existence; but I have been fortunate enough  to obtain a printed circular issued by one of the Bishops containing  statistics of the astounding mass of paper thus collected, producing in  one district alone the sum of L1,200 in three months. I need not tell  you that this work is strongly promoted by the Catholic clergy. You can  have no idea of the difficulty we now have in procuring certain books  published but 30, 40, or 50 years ago of an ephemeral character.  Historical and theological books are very rare; novels and poetry of  that period are absolutely not to be found; medical and law books are  more common. I am bound to say that in no country have more books been  printed and more destroyed than in Holland. W. MULLER.\"    The policy of buying up all objectionable literature seems to me, I  confess, very short-sighted, and in most cases would lead to a greatly  increased reprint; it certainly would in these latitudes.    From the Church of Rome to the Church of England is no great leap, and  Mr. Smith, the Brighton bookseller, gives evidence thus:--      \"It may be worth your while to note that the clergy of the last two  centuries ought to be included in your list (of Biblioclasts). I have  had painful experience of the fact in the following manner. Numbers of  volumes in their libraries have had a few leaves removed, and in many  others whole sections torn out. I suppose it served their purpose thus  to use the wisdom of greater men and that they thus economised their own  time by tearing out portions to suit their purpose. The hardship to the  trade is this: their books are purchased in good faith as perfect, and  when resold the buyer is quick to claim damage if found defective, while  the seller has no redress.\"      Among the careless destroyers of books still at work should"]]]
