In the middle part of the  country the cities are almost all upon the shores of the Lake, or within  a short distance of the water, and there is therefore more traffic and  communication between them by means of vessels than is the case with  inland towns, whose trade must be carried on by caravans and waggons.  These not only move slowly, but are subject to be interrupted by the  Romany and by the banditti, or persons who, for moral or political  crimes, have been banished from their homes.    It is in the cities that cluster around the great central lake that all  the life and civilization of our day are found; but there also begin  those wars and social convulsions which cause so much suffering. When  was the Peninsula at peace? and when was there not some mischief and  change brewing in the republics? When was there not a danger from the  northern mainland?    Until recent years there was little knowledge of, and scarcely any  direct commerce or intercourse between, the central part and the  districts either of the extreme west or the north, and it is only now  that the north and east are becoming open to us; for at the back of the  narrow circle or cultivated land, the belt about the Lake, there extend  immense forests in every direction, through which, till very lately, no  practicable way had been cut. Even in the more civilized central part it  is not to this day easy to travel, for at the barriers, as you approach  the territories of every prince, they demand your business and your  papers; nor even if you establish the fact that you are innocent of  designs against the State, shall you hardly enter without satisfying the  greed of the officials.    A fine is thus exacted at the gate of every province and kingdom, and  again at the gateways of the towns. The difference of the coinage, such  as it is, causes also great loss and trouble, for the money of one  kingdom (though passing current by command in that territory) is not  received at its nominal value in the next on account of the alloy it  contains. It is, indeed, in many kingdoms impossible to obtain sterling  money. Gold there is little or none anywhere, but silver is the standard  of exchange, and copper, bronze, and brass, sometimes tin, are the  metals with which the greater number of the people transact their  business.    Justice is corrupt, for where there is a king or a prince it depends on  the caprice of a tyrant, and where there is a republic upon the shout of  the crowd, so that many, if they think they may be put on trial, rather  than face the risk at once escape into the woods. The League, though  based ostensibly on principles the most exalted and beneficial to  humanity, is known to be perverted. The members sworn to honour and the  highest virtue are swayed by vile motives, political hatreds, and  private passions, and even by money.    Men for ever trample upon men, each pushing to the front; nor is there  safety in remaining in retirement, since such are accused of biding  their time and of occult designs. Though the population of these cities  all counted together is not equal to the population that once dwelt in a  single second-rate city of the ancients, yet how much greater are the  bitterness and the struggle!    Yet not content with the bloodshed they themselves cause, the tyrants  have called in the aid of mercenary soldiers to assist them. And, to  complete the disgrace, those republics which proclaim themselves the  very home of patriotic virtues, have resorted to the same means. Thus we  see English cities kept in awe by troops of Welshmen, Irish, and even  the western Scots, who swarm in the council-chambers of the republics,  and, opening the doors of the houses, help themselves to what they will.  This, too, in the face of the notorious fact that these nations have  sworn to be avenged upon us, that their vessels sail about the Lake  committing direful acts of piracy, and that twice already vast armies  have swept along threatening to entirely overwhelm the whole  commonwealth.    What infatuation to admit bands of these same men into the very  strongholds and the heart of the land! As if upon the approach of their  countrymen they would remain true to the oaths they have sworn for pay,  and not rather admit them with open arms. No blame can, upon a just  consideration, be attributed to either of these nations that endeavour  to oppress us. For, as they point out, the ancients from whom we are  descended held them in subjection many hundred years, and took from them  all their liberties.    Thus the Welsh, or, as they call themselves, the Cymry, say that the  whole island was once theirs, and is theirs still by right of  inheritance. They were the original people who possessed it ages before  the arrival of those whom we call the ancients. Though they were driven  into the mountains of the far distant west, they never forgot their  language, ceased their customs, or gave up their aspirations to recover  their own. This is now their aim, and until recently it seemed as if  they were about to accomplish it. For they held all that country  anciently called Cornwall, having crossed over the Severn, and marched  down the southern shore. The rich land of Devon, part of Dorset (all,  indeed, that is inhabited), and the most part of Somerset, acknowledged  their rule. Worcester and Hereford and Gloucester were theirs; I mean,  of course, those parts that are not forest.    Their outposts were pushed forward to the centre of Leicestershire, and  came down towards Oxford. But thereabouts they met with the forces of  which I will shortly speak. Then their vessels every summer sailing from  the Severn, came into the Lake, and, landing wherever there was an  opportunity, they destroyed all things and carried off the spoil. Is it  necessary to say more to demonstrate the madness which possesses those  princes and republics which, in order to support their own tyranny, have  invited bands of these men into their very palaces and forts?    As they approached near what was once Oxford and is now Sypolis, the  armies of the Cymry came into collision with another of our invaders,  and thus their forward course to the south was checked. The Irish, who  had hitherto abetted them, turned round to defend their own usurpations.  They, too, say that in conquering and despoiling my countrymen they are  fulfilling a divine vengeance. Their land of Ireland had been for  centuries ground down with an iron tyranny by our ancestors, who closed  their lips with a muzzle, and led them about with a bridle, as their  poets say. But now the hateful Saxons (for thus both they and the Welsh  designate us) are broken, and delivered over to them for their spoil.    It is not possible to deny many of the statements that they make, but  that should not prevent us from battling with might and main against the  threatened subjection. What crime can be greater than the admission of  such foreigners as the guards of our cities? Now the Irish have their  principal rendezvous and capital near to the ancient city of Chester,  which is upon the ocean, and at the very top and angle of Wales. This is  their great settlement, their magazine and rallying-place, and thence  their expeditions have proceeded. It is a convenient port, and well  opposite their native land, from which reinforcements continually  arrive, but the Welsh have ever looked upon their possession of it with  jealousy.    At the period when the Cymry had nearly penetrated to Sypolis or Oxford,  the Irish, on their part, had overrun all the cultivated and inhabited  country in a south and south-easterly line from Chester, through Rutland  to Norfolk and Suffolk, and even as far as Luton. They would have spread  to the north, but in that direction they were met by the Scots, who had  all Northumbria. When the Welsh came near Sypolis, the Irish awoke to  the position of affairs.    Sypolis is the largest and most important city upon the northern shore  of the Lake, and it is situated at the entrance to the neck of land that  stretches out to the straits. If the Welsh were once well posted there,  the Irish could never hope to find their way to the rich and cultivated  south, for it is just below Sypolis that the Lake contracts, and forms a  strait in one place but a furlong wide. The two forces thus came into  collision, and while they fought and destroyed each other, Sypolis was  saved. After which, finding they were evenly matched, the Irish withdrew  two days' march northwards, and the Cymry as far westwards.    But now the Irish, sailing round the outside of Wales, came likewise up  through the Red Rocks, and so into the Lake, and in their turn landing,  harassed the cities. Often Welsh and Irish vessels, intending to attack  the same place, have discerned each other approaching, and, turning from  their proposed action, have flown at each other's throats. The Scots  have not harassed us in the south much, being too far distant, and those  that wander hither come for pay, taking service as guards. They are,  indeed, the finest of men, and the hardiest to battle with. I had  forgotten to mention that it is possible the Irish might have pushed  back the Welsh, had not the kingdom of York suddenly reviving, by means  which shall be related, valiantly thrust out its masters, and fell upon  their rear.    But still these nations are always upon the verge and margin of our  world, and wait but an opportunity to rush in upon it. Our countrymen  groan under their yoke, and I say again that infamy should be the  portion of those rulers among us who have filled their fortified places  with mercenaries derived from such sources.    The land, too, is weak, because of the multitude of bondsmen. In the  provinces and kingdoms round about the Lake there is hardly a town where  the slaves do not outnumber the free as ten to one.

At each engine shed, in addition to the main storage  reservoir, there is a smaller distributing tank, which is erected at a  sufficient height to supply the tenders, and very much resembles the  ordinary water tanks. These distributing tanks are circular, about 81/2 ft.  diameter and 6 ft. high, and of 1/4 in. plates; their inside mean area is  calculated exactly, and a scale graduated in inches stands in the middle  of the tank; a glass with scale is used outside in summer time. Each inch  in height on the scale is converted into cubic feet, and then by means of  a table is converted into Russian poods, according to the specific gravity  at various temperatures. As it would be superfluous to graduate the table  for each separate degree of temperature, the columns in the table show the  weights for every 8 degrees Reaumur, which is quite sufficient: namely,  from 24 deg. to 17 deg., from 16 deg. to 9 deg., and so on, down to -24  deg.; the equivalent Fahrenheit range being from 86 deg. down to -22 deg.  Suppose the filling of a tender tank draws off a height of 27 in. from the  distributing tank, at a temperature of say -20 deg. R., these figures are  shown by the table to correspond with 200.61 poods = 7,245 lb., or 3.23  tons, of petroleum. This arrangement does very well in practice; both the  quantity and the temperature are entered on the driver's fuel bill at the  time of his taking in his supply.    _Engines._--The engines used in the trials were built by Borsig, of  Berlin, Schneider, of Creusot, and the Russian Mechanical and Mining  Company, of St. Petersburg. Their main dimensions and weights were about  the same, as follows, all of them having six wheels coupled, and 36 tons  adhesive weight; as originally constructed they had ordinary fire boxes  for burning anthracite or wood; cylinders 18-1/8 in. diameter and 24 in.  stroke; slide valves, outside lap 1-1/16 in., inside lap 3/32 in., maximum  travel, 4-9/16 in.; Stephenson link motion; boiler pressure, 120 lb. per  square inch; six wheels, all coupled, 4 ft. 3 in. in diameter; distance  between centers of leading and middle wheels, 6 ft. 2-3/4 in.; between  middle and trailing, 4 ft. 9-1/4 in.; total length of wheel base, 11 ft.;  weight empty, on leading wheels, 12.041 tons; middle, 10.782 tons;  trailing, 10.685 tons; total weight, 33.508 tons empty; weight in running  order, on leading wheels, 12.563 tons; middle, 11.885 tons; trailing  12.790 tons; total weight, 37.238 tons in running order. Tubes number 151;  outside diameter, 2-1/8 in.; length between tube plates, 13 ft. 10-1/8  in.; outside heating surface, 1,166 square feet; fire box heating surface,  82 square feet; total heating surface, 1,248 square feet; fire grate area,  17 square feet; tractive power =  65 per cent. of boiler pressure x (cyl. diam.) squared x stroke / diameter of wheels  = 0.65 x 120 x (18.125) squared x 24 / 51 = 5.383 tons. Ratio of tractive power  to adhesion weight = 5.383 / 37.238 = 1 / 6.9.    _Tender._--Contents: water, 310 cubic feet, or 1,933 gallons, or 81/2  tons; anthracite, 600 poods, or 10 tons; or wood, 11/2 cubic sajene, or  514 cubic feet; weight empty, 13.477 tons; weight in running order, 28.665  tons; six wheels.           *       *       *       *       *    _Petroleum Refuse--Comparative Trials with Petroleum, Anthracite,  Bituminous Coal, and Wood, between Archeda and Tsaritsin on Grazi and  Tsaritsin Railway, in Winter Time._    -----+---+-----+------+---+-----+------+-----------+-------------+------+------------       | L |     |          |     |      |           |             |      |       | o |     |  Train   |     |      |           | Consumption |      |       | c |     |  alone.  |     |      |           |  Including  |      |  Date.| o |     |          |     |      |           | Lighting up.|      |  1883.| m |     |----+-----|     |      |           |             | Cost |       | o |Train|Num-|     | Dis-| Car  |           |             |  of  |Atmospheric       | t |     |ber |Gross|tance|miles.|  Fuel.    |-------+-----| fuel |temperature       | i |     | of |load.| run.|      |           |       | Per | per  |   and       | v |     |Loa-|     |     |      |           | Total |train| train| weather.       | e |     |ded |     |     |      |           |       |mile.| mile.|       | . |     |cars|     |     |      |           |       |     |      |  -----+---+-----+----+-----+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----+------+------------       |   |     | No.| Tons|Miles|      |           |       |     |Pence.|  -----+---+-----+----+-----+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----+------+------------       |  8|32-23| 25 | 400 | 388 | 9,700|Anthracite.| 31799 |81.90|11.957|-17 deg. to -18 deg.       |   |32-23|    |     |     |      |           |  lb.  | lb. |      |   Reau.,   Feb.|   |     |    |     |     |      |           |       |     |      | equiv. to    8  |   |24-21|    |     |     |      |           |       |     |      |-6 deg. to -81/2 deg.       | 14|24-21| 25 | 400 | 388 | 9,700|Bituminous |37557.5|96.53|14.093|   Fah.       |   |     |    |     |     |      | Coal.     |  lb.  | lb. |      |       |  7|26-29| 25 | 400 | 194 | 4,830|Petroleum  | 9462  |48.77| 5.487|   Strong       |   |     |          |     |      | refuse.   |  lb.  | lb. |      | side wind.  -----+---+-----+----+-----+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----+------+------------       | 24|32-23| 25 | 400 | 194 | 4,850|Anthracite.|12639.5|65.15| 9.512|-5 deg. to -9 deg.

Dimensions of locomotives:    Cylinders, 18 1/8 in. diam. and 24 in. stroke; Wheels, 4 feet 3 in. diam.;    Total heating surface, 1,248 sq. feet: Total adhesion weight, 36 tons;    Boiler pressure, 8 to 9 atm.    The preceding table shows the results of comparative trials made in winter  with different sorts of fuel, under exactly similar conditions as to type  of engine, profile of line, and load of train. Two sets of comparative  trials were made, both of them in winter. The three engines used were some  of those built by Schneider. In comparison with anthracite, the economy in  favor of petroleum refuse was 41 per cent. in weight, and 55 per cent. in  cost. With bituminous coal there was a difference of 49 per cent. in favor  of petroleum as to weight and 61 per cent. as to cost. As compared with  wood petroleum was 50 per cent. cheaper. At a speed of fourteen miles an  hour up an incline of 1 in 125 the steam pressure was easily kept up at 9  to 91/2 atm. with a No. 9 injector feeding the boiler all the time.    Up to the present time the author has altered seventy-two locomotives to  burn petroleum; and from his own personal observations made on the foot  plate with considerable frost he is satisfied that no other fuel can  compare with petroleum either for locomotives or for other purposes. In  illustration of its safety in case of accident, a photograph was exhibited  of an accident that occurred on the author's line on 30th December, 1883,  when a locomotive fired with petroleum ran down the side of an embankment,  taking the train after it; no explosion or conflagration of any kind took  place under such trying circumstances, thus affording some proof of the  safety of the petroleum refuse in this mode of firing. Although it is  scarcely possible that petroleum firing will ever be of use for  locomotives on the ordinary railways of coal-bearing England, yet the  author is convinced chat, even in such a country, its employment would be  an enormous boon on underground lines.           *       *       *       *       *          CHARCOAL KILNS.      [Illustration: KILN FOR BURNING CHARCOAL.]    In answer to the inquiry of a correspondent about charcoal making, we  offer two illustrations that show a method of manufacture differing from  that usually adopted, which is that of burning on the bare ground, and  covering with soil or sods to exclude the air. These kilns are made of  brick, one course being sufficient, bands of iron or timber framework  being added to strengthen the brickwork with greater economy. The usual  style is conical, and the size is 24 feet in diameter, with an equal  height, holding about 40 cords of wood. The difference in price is 1-1/8  d. per bushel in favor of these kilns as compared with the usual mounds,  the burner being furnished with the use of the kilns, and the timber  standing, the kiln burning costing 2-1/8 d., and the other 3-1/4 d. The  kilns must be lined to about halfway up with fire-brick, the cost of which  will vary with the locality, but will be about L200, and as 40 to 50  bushels of coal have been made per cord the extra yield on good charcoal  and the lessening of the cost of making soon covers any extra outlay on  the cost of the kilns. The wall of the kiln is carried up nearly straight  for 6 feet, when it is drawn in, so as to become bluntly conical. Upon the  top a plate of iron is fastened in the manner of the keystone of an arch,  and bands of iron are passed round the kiln and drawn tight with screw  bolts and nuts to"]]]
