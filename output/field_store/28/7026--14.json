Admitting that the integrated division might be  an encouraging gesture toward certain minorities, General Marshall  added that \"the urgency of the present military situation necessitates  our using tested and proved methods of procedure, and using them with  all haste.\"[2-30]                       [Footnote 2-28: Ltr, Walter White to Gen Marshall, 22                     Dec 41, AG 291.21 (12-22-41).]                       [Footnote 2-29: See C-279, 2, Volunteer Division                     Folder, NAACP Collection, Manuscripts Division,                     LC.]                       [Footnote 2-30: Ltr, CofS to Dorothy Canfield Fisher,                     16 Feb 42, OCS 20602-254.]    Even though it rejected the idea of a volunteer, integrated division,  the Army staff reviewed in the fall of 1942 a proposal for  the assignment of some black recruits to white units. The  Organization-Mobilization Group of G-3, headed by Col. Edwin W.  Chamberlain, argued that the Army General Classification Test scores  proved that black soldiers in groups were less useful to the Army than  white soldiers in groups. It was a waste of manpower, funds, and  equipment, therefore, to organize the increasingly large numbers of  black recruits into segregated units. Not only was such organization  wasteful, but segregation \"aggravated if not caused in its entirety\"  the racial friction that was already plaguing the Army. To avoid both  the waste and the strife, Chamberlain recommended that the Army halt  the activation of additional black units and integrate black recruits  in the low-score categories, IV and V, into white units in the ratio  of one black to nine whites. The black recruits would be used as  cooks, orderlies, and drivers, and in other jobs which required only  the minimum basic training and which made up 10 to 20 percent of those  in the average unit. Negroes in the higher categories, I through III,  would be assigned to existing black units where they could be expected  to improve the performance of those units. Chamberlain defended his  plan against possible charges of discrimination by pointing out that  the Negroes would be assigned wholly on the basis of native capacity,  not race, and that this plan would increase the opportunities for  Negroes to participate in the war effort. To those who objected on the  grounds that the proposal meant racial integration, Chamberlain  replied that there was no more integration involved than in \"the   (p. 032)  employment of Negroes as servants in a white household.\"[2-31]                       [Footnote 2-31: Draft Memo (initialed E.W.C.) for Gen                     Edwards, G-3 Negro File, 1942-44. See also Lee,                     _Employment of Negro Troops_, pp. 152-57.]    The Chamberlain Plan and a variant proposed the following spring  prompted discussion in the Army staff that clearly revealed general  dissatisfaction with the current policy. Nonetheless, in the face of  opposition from the service and ground forces, the plan was abandoned.  Yet because something had to be done with the mounting numbers of  black draftees, the Army staff reversed the decision made in its  prewar mobilization plans and turned once more to the concept of the  all-black division. The 93d Infantry Division was reactivated in the  spring of 1942 and the 92d the following fall. The 2d Cavalry Division  was reconstituted as an all-black unit and reactivated in February  1943. These units were capable of absorbing 15,000 or more men each  and could use men trained in the skills of practically every arm and  service.    This absorbency potential became increasingly important in 1943 when  the chairman of the War Manpower Commission, Paul V. McNutt, began to  attack the use of racial quotas in selecting inductees. He considered  the practice of questionable legality, and the commission faced  mounting public criticism as white husbands and fathers were drafted  while single healthy Negroes were not called.[2-32] Secretary Stimson  defended the legality of the quota system. He did not consider the  current practice \"discriminatory in any way\" so long as the Army  accepted its fair percentage of Negroes. He pointed out that the  Selective Service Act provided that no man would be inducted \"_unless  and until_\" he was acceptable to the services, and Negroes were  acceptable \"only at a rate at which they can be properly  assimilated.\"[2-33] Stimson later elaborated on this theme, arguing that  the quota system would be necessary even after the Army reached full  strength because inductions would be limited to replacement of losses.  Since there were few Negroes in combat, their losses would be  considerably less than those of whites. McNutt disagreed with  Stimson's interpretation of the law and announced plans to abandon it  as soon as the current backlog of uninducted Negroes was absorbed, a  date later set for January 1944.[2-34]                       [Footnote 2-32: Ltr, Paul V. McNutt to SW, 17 Feb 43,                     AG 327.31 (9-19-40) (1) sec. 12.]                       [Footnote 2-33: Ltr, SW to McNutt, 20 Feb 43, AG                     327.31 (9-19-40) (1) sec. 12.]                       [Footnote 2-34: Ltr, McNutt to SW, 23 Mar 43, AG                     327.31 (9-19-40) (1) sec. 12.]    A crisis over the quota system was averted when, beginning in the  spring of 1943, the Army's monthly manpower demands outran the ability  of the Bureau of Selective Service to provide black inductees. So long  as the Army requested more Negroes than the bureau could supply,  little danger existed that McNutt would carry out his threat.[2-35] But  it was no victory for the Army. The question of the quota's legality  remained unanswered, and it appeared that the Army might be forced to  abandon the system at some future time when there was a black surplus.                       [Footnote 2-35: The danger was further reduced when,                     as part of a national manpower allocation reform,                     President Roosevelt removed the Bureau of Selective                     Service from the War Manpower Commission's control                     and restored it to its independent status as the                     Selective Service System on 5 December 1943. See                     Stimson and Bundy, _On Active Service_, pp. 483-86;                     Theodore Wyckoff, \"The Office of the Secretary of                     War Under Henry L. Stimson,\" in CMH.]    There were many reasons for the sudden shortage of black inductees (p. 033)  in the spring of 1943. Since more Negroes were leaving the service for  health or other reasons, the number of calls for black draftees had  increased. In addition, local draft boards were rejecting more  Negroes. But the basic reason for the shortage was that the magnitude  of the war had finally turned the manpower surpluses of the 1930's  into manpower shortages, and the shortages were appearing in black as  well as white levies for the armed forces. The Negro was no longer a  manpower luxury. The quota calls for Negroes rose in 1944, and black  strength stood at 701,678 men in September, approximately 9.6 percent  of the whole Army. [2-36] The percentage of black women in the Army  stayed at less than 6 percent of the Women's Army Auxiliary  Corps--after July 1943 the Women's Army Corps--throughout the war.  Training and serving under the same racial policy that governed the  employment of men, the women's corps also had a black recruitment goal  of 10 percent, but despite the active efforts of recruiters and  generally favorable publicity from civil rights groups, the volunteer  organization was unable to overcome the attitude among young black  women that they would not be well received at Army posts.[2-37]                       [Footnote 2-36: Strength of the Army, 1 Jan 46,                     STM-30, p. 60.]                       [Footnote 2-37: Memo, Dir of Mil Pers, SOS, for G-1,                     12 Sep 42, SPGAM/322.5 (WAAC) (8-24-42).

Treadwell, _The Women's Army Corps_,                     United States Army in World War II (Washington:                     Government Printing Office, 1954), especially                     Chapter III. See also Lee, _Employment of Negro                     Troops_, pp. 421-26.]    Faced with manpower shortages, the Army began to reassess its plan to  distribute Negroes proportionately throughout the arms and services.  The demand for new service units had soared as the size of the  overseas armies grew, while black combat units, unwanted by overseas  commanders, had remained stationed in the United States. The War  Department hoped to ease the strain on manpower resources by  converting black combat troops into service troops. A notable example  of the wholesale conversion of such combat troops and one that  received considerable notice in the press was the inactivation of the  2d Cavalry Division upon its arrival in North Africa in March 1944.  Victims of the change included the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments,  historic combat units that had fought with distinction in the Indian  wars, with Teddy Roosevelt in Cuba, and in the Philippine  Insurrection.[2-38]                       [Footnote 2-38: Inactivation of the 2d Cavalry                     Division began in February 1944, and its                     headquarters completed the process on 10 May.

One of the eunuchs ran to fetch melons, whilst others were employed in  showering down almonds from the branches that overhung this amiable  party.    In the midst of this festive scene there appeared a light on the top of  the highest mountain, which attracted the notice of every eye; this light  was not less bright than the moon when at full, and might have been taken  for her, had it not been that the moon was already risen.  The phenomenon  occasioned a general surprise, and no one could conjecture the cause; it  could not be a fire, for the light was clear and bluish, nor had meteors  ever been seen of that magnitude or splendour.  This strange light faded  for a moment, and immediately renewed its brightness; it first appeared  motionless at the foot of the rock, whence it darted in an instant to  sparkle in a thicket of palm-trees; from thence it glided along the  torrent, and at last fixed in a glen that was narrow and dark.  The  moment it had taken its direction, Gulchenrouz, whose heart always  trembled at anything sudden or rare, drew Nouronihar by the robe, and  anxiously requested her to return to the harem; the women were  importunate in seconding the entreaty, but the curiosity of the Emir's  daughter prevailed; she not only refused to go back, but resolved at all  hazards to pursue the appearance.  Whilst they were debating what was  best to be done, the light shot forth so dazzling a blaze, that they all  fled away shrieking; Nouronihar followed them a few steps, but, coming to  the turn of a little bye-path, stopped, and went back alone; as she ran  with an alertness peculiar to herself, it was not long before she came to  the place where they had just been supping.  The globe of fire now  appeared stationary in the glen, and burned in majestic stillness.  Nouronihar, compressing her hands upon her bosom, hesitated for some  moments to advance; the solitude of her situation was new, the silence of  the night awful, and every object inspired sensations which till then she  never had felt: the affright of Gulchenrouz recurred to her mind, and she  a thousand times turned to go back, but this luminous appearance was  always before her; urged on by an irresistible impulse, she continued to  approach it, in defiance of every obstacle that opposed her progress.    At length she arrived at the opening of the glen; but, instead of coming  up to the light, she found herself surrounded by darkness, excepting that  at a considerable distance a faint spark glimmered by fits.  She stopped  a second time; the sound of water-falls mingling their murmurs, the  hollow rustlings amongst the palm-branches, and the funereal screams of  the birds from their rifted trunks, all conspired to fill her with  terror; she imagined every moment that she trod on some venomous reptile;  all the stories of malignant Dives and dismal Gouls thronged into her  memory; but her curiosity was, notwithstanding, more predominant than her  fears; she therefore firmly entered a winding track that led towards the  spark, but, being a stranger to the path, she had not gone far till she  began to repent of her rashness.    \"Alas!\" said she, \"that I were but in those secure and illuminated  apartments where my evenings glided on with Gulchenrouz!  Dear child! how  would thy heart flutter with terror wert thou wandering in these wild  solitudes like me!\"  At the close of this apostrophe she regained her  road, and, coming to steps hewn out in the rock, ascended them  undismayed; the light, which was now gradually enlarging, appeared above  her on the summit of the mountain; at length she distinguished a  plaintive and melodious union of voices, proceeding from a sort of  cavern, that resembled the dirges which are sung over tombs; a sound,  likewise, like that which arises from the filling of baths, at the same  time struck her ear; she continued ascending, and discovered large wax  torches in full blaze planted here and there in the fissures of the rock;  this preparation filled her with fear, whilst the subtle and potent odour  which the torches exhaled caused her to sink almost lifeless at the  entrance of the grot.    Casting her eyes within in this kind of trance, she beheld a large  cistern of gold filled with a water, whose vapour distilled on her face a  dew of the essence of roses; a soft symphony resounded through the grot;  on the sides of the cistern she noticed appendages of royalty, diadems,  and feathers of the heron, all sparkling with carbuncles; whilst her  attention was fixed on this display of magnificence, the music ceased,  and a voice instantly demanded:    \"For what monarch were these torches kindled, this bath prepared, and  these habiliments, which belong, not only to the sovereigns of the earth,  but even to the Talismanic Powers?\"    To which a second voice answered: \"They are for the charming daughter of  the Emir Fakreddin.\"    \"What,\" replied the first, \"for that trifler, who consumes her time with  a giddy child, immersed in softness, and who at best can make but an  enervated husband?\"    \"And can she,\" rejoined the other voice, \"be amused with such empty  trifles, whilst the Caliph, the sovereign of the world, he who is  destined to enjoy the treasures of the pre-adamite Sultans, a prince six  feet high, and whose eyes pervade the inmost soul of a female, is  inflamed with the love of her.  No! she will be wise enough to answer  that passion alone that can aggrandise her glory; no doubt she will, and  despise the puppet of her fancy.  Then all the riches this place  contains, as well as the carbuncle of Giamschid, shall be hers.\"    \"You judge right,\" returned the first voice, \"and I haste to Istakar to  prepare the palace of subterranean fire for the reception of the bridal  pair.\"    The voices ceased, the torches were extinguished, the most entire  darkness succeeded, and Nouronihar, recovering with a start, found  herself reclined on a sofa in the harem of her father.  She clapped her  hands, and immediately came together Gulchenrouz and her women, who, in  despair at having lost her, had despatched eunuchs to seek her in every  direction; Shaban appeared with the rest, and began to reprimand her with  an air of consequence:    \"Little impertinent,\" said he, \"whence got you false keys? or are you  beloved of some Genius that hath given you a pick-lock?  I will try the  extent of your power; come, to your chamber! through the two skylights;  and expect not the company of Gulchenrouz; be expeditious!  I will shut  you up in the double tower.\"    At these menaces Nouronihar indignantly raised her head, opened on Shaban  her black eyes, which, since the important dialogue of the enchanted  grot, were considerably enlarged, and said: \"Go, speak thus to slaves,  but learn to reverence her who is born to give laws, and subject all to  her power.\"    She was proceeding in the same style, but was interrupted by a sudden  exclamation of \"The Caliph!  The Caliph!\"  The curtains at once were  thrown open, and the slaves prostrate in double rows, whilst poor little  Gulchenrouz hid himself beneath the elevation of a sofa.  At first  appeared a file of black eunuchs, trailing after them long trains of  muslin embroidered with gold, and holding in their hands censers, which  dispensed as they passed the grateful perfume of the wood of aloes; next  marched Bababalouk with a solemn strut, and tossing his head as not  over-pleased at the visit; Vathek came close after, superbly robed; his  gait was unembarrassed and noble, and his presence would have engaged  admiration, though he had not been the sovereign of the world; he  approached Nouronihar with a throbbing heart, and seemed enraptured at  the full effulgence of her radiant eyes, of which he had before caught  but a few glimpses; but she instantly depressed them, and her confusion  augmented her beauty.    Bababalouk, who was a thorough adept in coincidences of this nature, and  knew that the worst game should be played with the best face, immediately  made a signal for all to retire; and no sooner did he perceive beneath  the sofa the little one's feet, than he drew him forth without ceremony,  set him upon his shoulders, and lavished on him as he went off a thousand  odious caresses; Gulchenrouz cried out, and resisted till his cheeks  became the colour of the blossom of the pomegranate, and the tears that  started into his eyes shot forth a gleam of indignation; he cast a  significant glance at Nouronihar, which the Caliph noticing, asked: \"Is  that then your Gulchenrouz?\"    \"Sovereign of the world?\" answered she, \"spare my cousin, whose innocence  and gentleness deserve not your anger.\"    \"Take comfort,\" said Vathek, with a smile; \"he is in good hands.  Bababalouk is fond of children, and never goes without sweetmeats and  comfits.\"    The daughter of Fakreddin was abashed, and suffered Gulchenrouz to be  borne away without adding a word.  The tumult of her bosom betrayed her  confusion; and Vathek, becoming still more impassioned, gave a loose to  his frenzy, which had only not subdued the last faint strugglings of  reluctance, when the Emir, suddenly bursting in, threw his face upon the  ground at the feet of the Caliph, and said:    \"Commander of the Faithful! abase not yourself to the meanness of your  slave.\"    \"No, Emir,\" replied Vathek; \"I raise her to an equality with myself; I  declare her my wife, and the glory of your race shall extend from one  generation to another.\"    \"Alas! my lord,\" said Fakreddin, as he plucked off the honours of his  beard, \"cut short the days of your faithful servant, rather than force  him to depart from his word.  Nouronihar, as her hands evince, is  solemnly promised to Gulchenrouz, the son of my brother Ali Hassan; they  are united also in heart, their faith is mutually plighted, and affiances  so sacred cannot be broken.\"    \"What then!\" replied the Caliph, bluntly, \"would you"]]]
