But these secret agents were,  unknown to the king, all devoted to the parliaments, and consequently  inimical to courtiers, favorites, and especially mistresses. God knows  how they disposed of us! By these unpropitious channels the king had  learnt all the hatred which was borne to madame de Pompadour. He was  afraid of exciting the discontent of the people by announcing another  mistress, and was no less intimidated at the severity of madame Louise,  and the ill-humor of his other children. He loved his pleasure much, but  his ease more.    Comte Jean, who was restrained by no considerations, advised me to  overleap all difficulty, by asking the king myself for the favor which  I coveted. His advice seemed rational, and I was besides urged on to do  so. Each day brought to me impertinences said of me by the noble ladies  of the chateau. I learnt that they boasted that I should never set foot  in the great apartments, but should remain the obscure mistress of the  king. This made me impatient, and by degrees deprived me of my natural  gaiety.    One day when the king was with me, he perceived my want of spirits.    \"What ails you?\" said be, with the greatest solicitude.    \"What ails me!\" replied I, \"I wish I were dead, rather than see myself  the butt of all the scandal of the foul-mouthed gossips of your court.\"    The king, suspecting the confidence I was about to repose in him, was  sorry he had asked for it, and was silent. He began to play a tattoo  with his fingers on the chimney-piece. At this moment mademoiselle Chon  came in. The king, delighted at seeing her, instantly inquired into her  state of health. She, after a profound reverence, said,    \"Sire, how can I be well when there is trouble in my family?\"    \"Ah, _bon Dieu_! what is this?\" said he, turning to me.    \"I am insulted, hooted: they say that I have the misfortune to be no  longer in the good graces of your majesty.\"    \"Ah, tell them they lie in their throats,\" replied the king, kissing me  on the forehead; \"you are the woman of my heart, and she whom I would  fain load with honors.\"    \"Your majesty speaks to me,\" I answered, \"with great condescension [my  sister-in-law left the room that she might not spoil the explanation],  but yet you are the cause of the insolences which I am subjected to from  the vile crew.\"    \"What is the matter with you to-day? In truth you are a perfect little  devil.\"    \"I wish I were, that I might punish evil tongues, since there is no king  of France to avenge me.\"    \"You are severe, madame,\" replied Louis XV, turning his imposing and  handsome face towards me, and to which he vainly endeavored to give an  air of anger. I saw my success, and added,    \"Yes, sire, it is insupportable for me to think that I am supposed not  to possess your friendship, and that I only play the part of a temporary  friend. It makes me wretched: you must not be angry if I complain of you  to your royal self.\"    \"Well, well, you madcap, what must I do? Whom must I banish?\"    \"Oh, sire, no one: with your august support I fear no person; nothing  but appearances.\"    \"You are an excellent creature; in your place madame de Pompadour would  have imprisoned half France.\"    \"That was because she loved revenge better than she loved your majesty.  As for me, I should be miserable if I were the cause of one single  family complaining against you.\"    The king, delighted at these words, which really came from my heart,  embraced me tenderly two or three times, and said,    \"I wish your enemies could understand you, for they would soon be at  your knees. But if we imprison or exile no person, how shall we strike  terror into them?\"    \"It is not terror but envy that I would excite. Let me be presented at  court, and all my wishes will be satisfied.\"    \"I cannot for the life of me divine why you should lay so much stress  on coming to weary yourself with the ceremonies of myself and daughters.  Heaven preserve you from all the irksomeness of court ceremony!\" And  Louis XV sighed. \"Did you ever think,\" he added, \"of all the vanities,  all the interests I have to manage; all the intrigues that are  perpetually agitating, and all the opposition made to me? The court,  the city, the people, will rise against me: they will clamor,  groan, complain; verse, prose, epigram, and pamphlet will appear in  uninterrupted succession. You would be first attacked, and hatred will  perhaps extend to me. I shall see again the times when the Damiens,  in the name of the parliaments, as one party says, in the name of the  Jesuits, as the other party says, and, what is more true, in the name--\"    The king suddenly paused; a deep shade of melancholy settled on his  features, his noble head dropped on his bosom. Louis XV remained for  some time motionless; at length,    \"Well,\" he exclaimed, attempting to force a smile, \"well! I will write  to the ladies de Grammont, to inform them that they need not give  themselves the trouble to remain near me at the chateau.\"    On his saying these words I darted towards the door, and went into my  chamber. The king followed, and finding there mademoiselle Chon, who was  working at some tapestry, said to her,    \"Mademoiselle, I confide to your care, and by oral _lettre de cachet_,  the most amiable little devil in France. And now, mademoiselle du Barry,  having nothing further to add, I pray God to take you to His powerful  and holy keeping.\"    After this pleasantry the king, delighted at the gay termination of  a somewhat serious scene, went, or rather vanished; for to use a  proverbial expression, he ran like a thief.    As soon as I was alone with my sister-in-law, I told her all that had  passed.    \"I see,\" said she, \"that the king is fearful of offending the duc de  Choiseul, and giving annoyance to his daughters. But a step must  be determined on which will place you out of the reach of complete  disgrace. Would it not be best to get some nobleman, who can do so with  influence, to speak to him on the subject? If the duc de Richelieu were  here--\"    \"But,\" I instantly exclaimed, \"have we not his nephew, the duc  d'Aiguillon? He is well with the king, and I am certain will take the most  lively interest in all that concerns me.\"    \"I have no doubt of it,\" said Chon, with a sly look. \"Write to him to  come, and you can arrange your ulterior proceedings.\"    On this advice, which was quite to my taste, I went instantly to my  writing-table, the last present which the king had made me. It was made  of silver gilt, and china slabs beautifully painted. When I opened it,  a glass was lifted which reflected my countenance. I sat down and wrote  the following note to the duc d'Aiguillon:--    \"You must be content. I want your assistance, I really want it. The  moment has come for deserving all my confidence. Will you have it at all  risks and perils? Reflect well before you undertake this: if you accept,  come to-day at five o'clock precisely, neither later nor sooner.\"    A little while afterwards the following reply was brought.    \"One thing displeases me in your letter which else enchants me. You  appear to doubt my obedience. Am I not your slave? And when you say to  me _go_, will I not _go_? Rely on me as on yourself; even more: for your  vivacity may lead you into error, and I shall preserve my reason. Yes,  madame, I will, when near you, preserve my reason when your interests  are at stake. At the fixed hour I shall have the honor to lay at your  feet my respectful homage and boundless devotion.\"    It was impossible to express a real sentiment with more delicacy. I  was charmed at it, no longer doubting that the duke would consider my  interests as his own. I awaited the hour of five with impatience,  when my good fortune brought the prince de Soubise. After the first  compliments,    \"Well, madame la comtesse, when is your presentation to take place?\"    \"I do not know, monsieur le marechal; there are obstacles in the way.  I fear that they who wish to injure me abuse their influence with the  king.\"    \"I see that his majesty hesitates, altho' he is desirous of giving you  station. He must be stimulated to know that he is master; and that if he  shows any wavering in this particular, it will be made use of to govern  him hereafter.\"    Heartily did I applaud the language of M. de Soubise: I did not suspect  that the dear prince had another motive behind. At the end of the  interview he said,    \"Madame, you would not have been as you now are had you been more  conciliatory towards me. I know the king, and know how to manage him. I  flatter myself that you would have been now presented had you deigned to  hear my advice.\"    \"Did I reject it? Was I wrong in declining to have mademoiselle Guimard  as ambassadress? Were you assured of her silence? Might she not have  compromised us?\"    \"You are right; I did as one would have done at your age, and you have  done as I should do at mine; but there is always time to amend.\"    \"Certainly, prince.\"    \"You accept my advice, then.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, seeing the defile in which he wished to entrap me,  \"yes, if I am presented thro' your influence, from that moment you  become my guide and mentor. But it is important that the presentation be  not delayed; I rely on you to speak to the king this day about it; and  I know that he will give me every particular of the immense service you  will render me.\"    For once the madcap girl got the better of the practised courtier. M. de  Soubise, taken in his own snare, politely excused himself, and left me  with an assurance that he would speak to the king. He did speak, but  obtained nothing more than any other. You will see in my next letter  that I did not arrive at the accomplishment of my wishes without much  trouble.

(Paragraph 93, Fig. 51.) Small objects to  represent wings were tied to their arms. Each was given one of the fawn  skin bags (paragraph 90) with corn meal in it. In the hand of the  akÃ¡ninili who was to go to the south was placed one of the Ã§obolÃ§Ã , or  plumed wands, whose stem was painted black, the color of the north, as a  sign to all he might meet that he was a duly authorized messenger from a  medicine lodge in the north. In the hand of the other akÃ¡ninili was  placed a blue shafted wand, to show that he came from the south. Thus  equipped they were all ready for the journey. (Fig. 52.)    102. The chanter gave them his messages, telling them where to go, what  places they were to visit, what other chanters they were to see, what  dancers they were to invite, and what gifts they were authorized to  offer to the visiting performers for their trouble. Having given these  special instructions, he closed with the general instructions, which are  always given to the akÃ¡ninili, as follows:    These [pointing to the eagle feathers on the head] will make for you a  means of rising as you progress.    These [pointing to the wing symbols on the arm] will bear you onward.    This [pointing to the collar of beaver skin] will be a means of  recognition for you. For this reason it hangs around your neck.    Sprinkle meal across a little valley, across a big arroyo.    Across the roots of a tree sprinkle meal and then you may step over.    Sprinkle meal across a flat rock.    Then the plumed wand. For this purpose you carry it, that they will  recognize you as coming from a holy place.    103. The akÃ¡ninili on his journey scatters meal before him as directed  in these charges. He also scatters it on the medicine men whom he  visits, and for this reason he is called akÃ¡ninili, which signifies meal  sprinkler.    104. When the last word of the instructions was uttered, the couriers  departed, one to the north and one to the south. It was not later than  7 o'clock when they left. As soon as they were gone, the work of  painting the picture appropriate to the day was begun. It was much more  elaborate than the painting of the previous day. Although a dozen men  worked on it, it was not finished until two o'clock. About the time it  was done, the akÃ¡ninili from the south returned. He was carefully  divested of all his ornaments. The white paint was scraped carefully  from his body and preserved in the medicine bags of those who scraped it  off. Then he was led out of the lodge.    105. When the picture was finished, the shaman, having applied pollen in  three places to each god, stuck around it in the ground, at regular  intervals, the three plumed wands which had stood before the door of the  lodge all day and the wand which the akÃ¡ninili from the south had just  brought back with him. This wand he placed at the south of the picture,  and laid beside it the collar, wings, and plumes which the akÃ¡ninili had  worn. The fifth, or north, wand was still absent with the courier who  went to the north.    106. All was ready now for the treatment of the sick woman. She was sent  for, and a crier went to the door of the lodge to announce that song and  ceremony were to begin. Accompanied by another woman, she entered,  carrying a basket with corn meal in it. This she sprinkled lightly over  the picture and then handed it to some of the assistants, who finished  the work she had begun by strewing the meal plentifully on the figures.  She sat on the form of the god in the east, facing the door, with her  feet extended, and her companion sat on the figure of the cornstalk in  the southeast. (Plate XVI.) In the mean time the medicine man had made a  cold infusion in an earthen bowl and placed it on the hands of the  rainbow figure (paragraph 169), laying over it a brush or sprinkler made  of feathers, with a handle of colored yarn. When the women were seated,  the chanter dipped his brush in the solution; sprinkled the picture  plentifully; touched each divine figure with the moistened brush in  three places-brow, mouth, and chest; administered the infusion to the  women, in two alternate draughts to each; drained the bowl himself; and  handed it to the bystanders, that they might finish the dregs and let  none of the precious stuff go to waste. Next came the fumigation. The  woman whom we have designated as the companion rose from her seat on the  picture and sat on the ground beside the door. The principal patient  retained her seat on the eastern god. Near each a live coal was laid on  the ground. On the coal a strong scented but rather fragrant mixture was  thrown, and as the fumes arose the women waved them towards their faces  and breathed them in as before. The coal was extinguished and carefully  removed, as on previous occasions. The application of the sacred dust to  the body of the patient followed. The shaman moistened his hands with  saliva and pressed them to the feet of all the gods. Some of the powder,  of course, stuck to his palms. This he applied to the feet of the  patient. Thus he took dust from the knees, abdomens, chests, shoulders,  and heads of the figures and applied it to corresponding parts of the  patient's form, making a strong massage with each application.    107. When the patient had departed many of the spectators advanced to  the picture and gathered the corn pollen (paragraphs 105 and 112), now  rendered doubly sacred, and put it in their medicine bags. Some took  portions of the remaining dust from the figures, after the manner of the  shaman, and applied it to ailing portions of their persons. If the  devotee had disease in his legs, he took dust from the legs of the  figures; if in his head, the dust was taken from the heads of the  figures, and so on.    108. By the time they were all done the picture was badly marred; yet  its general form and some of the details were quite distinguishable.  Then it became the province of the chanter to completely obliterate it.  He began with the white god in the east and took in turn the figures in  the southeast (corn), south, southwest, west, center, northwest, north,  and northeast. Next, the figure of the rainbow was erased from foot to  head, and, on his way, the chanter knocked down, with rather vicious  blows, the plumed wands which stood up around the picture. When he came  to the round figure in the center he dug up a cup which had been buried  there. He erased the picture with a long slender wand and sang in the  meantime, to the accompaniment of the rattling of his assistants,  a plaintive chant in a minor key, which was perhaps the most melodious  Indian song I ever heard. All was over at half past 2 in the afternoon.    109. Later in the day it was announced that the other akÃ¡ninili was  approaching from the north. He could then be observed about a mile away  in an open plain. As he advanced the sound of his whistle was heard. At  exactly half past 4 he entered the medicine lodge, where the chanter  motioned him to a seat in the south. Singing and rattling were at once  begun and the akÃ¡ninili was divested of his trappings in the following  order: head plumes, beaver collar, necklace, right wing, left wing,  belt, sash, moccasins. The white paint was removed and preserved as on  the former occasion. He was led out of the lodge, where he was well  washed from head to foot in a hot decoction of the detergent amolÃ« and  dried with corn meal. Two large blood blisters were to be seen on the  inner aspects of his thighs, brought on by the friction of his  breechcloth in running. He said that he had run constantly when not in  sight from our camp, had traveled a long way since morning, and was very  tired. It seems to be the custom with the akÃ¡ninilis to walk slowly when  near camp and to run when out of sight, probably to follow the mythic  examples of TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni and IndsiskÃ Ã¯. (Paragraph 63.)    110. With the toilet of the akÃ¡ninili the ceremonies of the day ended.  He returned to the lodge to relate his adventures and get some food.  During the day visitors arrived occasionally from distant camps. In the  afternoon there were several young men present, who busied themselves in  grubbing and clearing the ground where the corral was to be built and  the great dance of the last night was to be held. I remained in the  lodge until it was quite late, and I frequently rose during the night to  see if anything was going on; but the night passed without event, like  the previous one.      111. SEVENTH DAY. The painting of the picture and the treatment of the  sick woman were the only works performed on this day (Sunday,  October 26). The whistle sounded from the lodge at 6 a.m., but already  the plumed wands and the beaver collars had been placed before the door  of the medicine lodge and the sand for the groundwork of the picture had  been brought in. As the picture (Plate XVII) was to be larger than those  which preceded it, the fire was moved quite near to the door; the heated  earth which lay under the fire in its former position was dug up and  replaced with cold earth, probably for the comfort of the artists.    112. The work of the painters was begun soon after 6 a.m. and was not  completed until about 2 p.m. About a dozen men were engaged on it, and  it occupied them, as we have seen, about eight hours. As usual, the  qaÃ§Ã li did very little of the manual labor; but he constantly watched  the work and frequently criticised and corrected it. When the painting  was done, it became his duty to apply the sacred corn pollen to the  brow, mouth, and chest of each of the gods and to set up the bounding  Ã§obolÃ§Ã  or plumed wands. After this he placed a bowl of water on the  left hand of the white"]]]
