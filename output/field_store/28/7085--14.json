As I had seen the night  before, it led straight across the desert, and in the distance in that  direction I could now see faint blue mountains. So there was an end to  this land of desolation after all, and I determined that after I had  seen what was below, I would follow that road! The slope went down  steeply and here the path was roughly stepped; as it led deeper, too,  the slope narrowed, until at the bottom the entrance to the crater lay  through a natural gateway of rock that rose high on either hand and  almost shut out the light. Through it the strange path led, and here in  the gloom the horror of this awful place again came upon me and I could  scarce bring myself to enter the narrow defile. I remember clutching my  revolver as I went forward at last: remember thinking too that it could  avail me nothing, for here was no live being to fear, here was naught  but the dead. . The utter silence and loneliness even after my months  of silence and loneliness seemed to weigh upon me like a heavy burden,  and when a bat came fluttering by me in the gloom I uttered a hoarse  cry of alarm. But the distance was but short, and soon I stood safe in  the daylight again, and on the floor of the crater. And now I could see  that the white floor I had thought was sand was also strewn with bones,  of animals principally, though men's skeletons also lay thick on every  side. Bones of the elephant principally; for among them lay huge tusks  in quantities, tusks the like of which I had never seen, except in  pictures of the giant mammoth of prehistoric ages, tusks the girth of a  man in size. Piled in all directions they lay, the whole vast floor was  indeed a stupendous charnel house. And among the white sand and bones  diamonds lay thick as pebbles on a beach.    Across this floor ran the path now a raised causeway some feet above  the level of the sand and about five hundred yards from where I stood  the fire burnt in front of a building in the shape of a pyramid. Still  no sign of life could I see and I made my way towards it. As I did so  the sun's rays broke over the edge of the cliff above, and fell full  upon the top of the pyramid, and another flame seemed to shoot from it,  and remained there flashing brilliantly.    I was close to the fire now, and saw that it was no hand-fed flame, but  a column that rose from an orifice in the rock, and burnt fiercely with  a low roaring noise, and a strong mephitic odor. Probably it was some  kind of natural gas; at any rate there was no one near it and nothing  to fear from it. The pyramid behind it was made of ivory, thousands of  tons of magnificent tusks going to make up its forty feet of height,  and up it, in steps, ran the path, for the pyramid was the culmination  of this road of dead. I climbed up and reached the apex, a platform  some twenty feet square, above which something still towered, crowned  by a flashing light.    Its brilliance dazzled me, and it was only by shading my eyes with my  palm that I could discern what the object was that bore it.    Then, directly beneath the bright glare I gradually made out a gigantic  face, glaring down upon me, a face carved with such wondrous art that,  monstrous as it was, it appeared to live, and to be endowed with such  awful malevolence that for a moment I shrank back in dismay. It was the  face of a woman, but the body that it crowned was that of a snake, and  was coiled round an ivory pillar rising from the platform. Marvelously  fashioned of bronze, the face, with bared serpent fangs, bent down as  though to strike: and set in a strangely fashioned diadem above the  brows was a gigantic diamond, as large as a man's head, and of such  blinding luster that it was impossible to look closely at it as well  try to gaze full at the midday sun.    It was an idol, undoubtedly; a Moloch waiting for a sacrifice; and as  my fascinated eyes at length left the face of terror, and passed down  the coiled body and ivory pillar, I saw that the sacrifice was already  there. For at the base lay a dead man, and his blood was scarcely dry  upon the altar.    He was fast bound with hide thongs to stanchions cut in the rock a man  almost as white as myself, with long, straight black hair, and clothed  in clean white flowing robes. His face was horribly disfigured, seared  and burnt as though by red-hot irons, and his features quite  indistinguishable. Apparently, then, he had been tortured, before being  stabbed to the heart by the strangely fashioned knife of bronze that  lay beside him.    It is beyond me to describe the terror with which the sight of this  dead and mutilated victim inspired me. I had seen no human being for so  long: dead Inyati's face had been the last that I had gazed upon; then,  after long I had seen the skeleton in the pool the road of skulls and  now at last I gazed upon a human form again, it was again that of the  dead.    All around me was death, death everywhere, and I felt that unless I  escaped, and found human companionship soon, my mind would give way  beneath these horrors.    And I must quit this place of sacrifice at once, for the fiends who had  laid this victim there would probably give me but scant mercy were I  found there.    I examined the body again: it might well have been that of a South  European, so light was the skin; and now I noted that on one wrist was  a copper bracelet exactly similar to the one Inyati had given me, and  which I now wore on my own wrist. I compared them, and found them  identical, and now I noted that the rude attempt at a snake's head into  which their fastenings were fashioned, was undoubtedly an imitation of  the head of the idol above me.    This, then, doubtless was Inyati's land, and this one of the priests he  had spoken of. Mayhap he had killed one of them and taken his bracelet  before he fled for he had spoken of jealousy and of a woman I---    But of the idol, the road, the craters he had said nothing . . . maybe  he knew not himself?    True, he had feared the priests, till the \"little gun\" had become his  with it he would, doubtless, have faced all the priests living but I,  looking at the dead man and realizing something of the manner of his  death, was in deadly fear . . . my revolver would be but little use  against fiends who served their own priests thus!    I must fly from this place at once if indeed it were not already too  late! But gaze as I could, no sign of life showed anywhere; no sound  broke the silence except the low hissing murmur of the flame that burnt  everlasting incense to the shrine of horror before me.    And so, glancing from side to side in mortal terror, starting at the  sound of my own soft footsteps, and feeling that unseen eyes watched me  from all sides, I left the Snake and its victim, the pyramid and the  flame, and fled swiftly along the causeway, not even stooping to pick  up the diamonds that lay on all sides, intent only upon escape. I  reached the entrance, and passed through the narrow portals and  breasted the steep slope, and fearful and over-wrought, I gained the  open plain again.    Northward lay the path to the mountains: south the labyrinth of craters  I had left; westward mayhap I should find the dunes? And pitiless as  they were, I chose that path rather than follow the road of skulls  towards the country and the mercy of such fiends as these people must  be!    Soon I had left the crate far behind, and no trace of the road could be  seen when I glanced back, but I could not shake off a haunting fear  that now possessed me, that I was being watched. Eyes seemed to follow  me everywhere, each bush or rock seemed to hide a watcher, and again  and again I turned aside and searched, and looked fearfully over my  shoulder, but nothing could I see.    And so I walked till evening, seeing no trace of the human beings I  knew must be near, and at last, somewhat easier in mind, I threw myself  down to sleep.    And awakened to find myself seized and held as in a vice, to feel  thongs passed about me, and a hand passing over my forehead . . .  gently . . . gently . . . and then all consciousness faded away.        CHAPTER VIII        THE CATACLYSM THE PRIESTESS \"LOOK AND FORGET\"        Now gazing down full upon me as though in exultation was again the  awful face of the Snake, with its diadem the great, bright diamond. Its  glare hurt me, and I tried to move my head, but in vain. I was tied  fast.    And now I realized that this was no part of an awful dream, but that I  lay a hopeless victim in the place of the tortured man I had seen but a  day before.    And I knew that I was no longer alone, for though I could see nothing  but the grim idol, I could hear around me the murmur of many tongues.  Low, but vast in volume, it seemed as though thousands were there below  me, hushed and waiting for the consummation of the sacrifice. At times  the murmur rose to a mutter as of distant thunder, then again it would  be hushed almost into dead silence.    I could not speak or move. I could only lie inert and helpless, filled  with the agony of despair, with closed eyes awaiting the stroke, and  praying silently that it would come before the mutilation I had seen on  the other face.    Now came a single hoarse voice near me intoning words in a chant; and  then in response broke out the deep roar of a multitude of voices!  Higher and higher it rose until the air vibrated with its thunder, then  again it would die away, fainter and fainter till it was nothing but as  the sighing of wind through dead men's bones.    Again and again chant and response broke forth, and now too I could  distinguish much of its meaning, for the tongue was that of Inyati.    A song of supplication it seemed to me, a song for the Snake's wrath to  be appeased to accept the sacrifice offered it, and to send rain upon  their dried up fields."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#14)"],[1,"is easy to see how parents of near  affinities may produce offspring perfect and healthy, or the reverse.  He holds, that to secure satisfactory results from any union, there  should be some inherent, constitutional, or fundamental difference;  some such difference as we often see in the human family to be the  ground of preference and attachment; as men generally prefer women of  a feminine rather than a masculine type. All desire, in a mate,  properties and qualities not possessed by themselves. Now assuming as  Mr. Walker holds, that organization is transmitted by halves, and  that, in animals of the same variety, either parent may give either  series of organs, we can see in the case of brother and sister that if  one receives the locomotive system of the father and the nutritive  system of the mother, and the other the locomotive system of the  mother and the nutritive system of the father, they are essentially  unlike, there is scarcely any similarity between them, although, as we  say, of precisely the same blood; and their progeny if coupled might  show no deterioration; whereas, if both have the same series of organs  from the same parents, they would be essentially the same, a sort of  quasi identity would exist between them, and they are utterly unfit to  be mated. There might be impotency, or barrenness, or the progeny, if  any, would be decidedly inferior to the parents; and the same applies,  more or less, to other relatives descended from a common ancestry, but  more distant than brother and sister. Mr. Walker also holds that  where the parents are not only of the same variety but of the same  family in the narrowest sense, the female always gives the locomotive  system and the father the nutritive; in which case the progeny is  necessarily inferior to the parents.    A careful consideration of the subject brings us to the following  conclusions, viz:    That in general practice, with the grades and mixed animals common in  the country, _close breeding should be scrupulously avoided_ as highly  detrimental. It is better _always_ to avoid breeding from near  affinities whenever stock-getters of the same breed and of equal merit  can be obtained which are not related. Yet, where this is not  possible, or where there is some desirable and clearly defined purpose  in view, as the fixing and perpetuating of some valuable quality in a  particular animal not common to the breed, and the breeder possesses  the knowledge and skill needful to accomplish his purpose, and the  animals are perfect in health and development, close breeding may be  practiced with advantage.    FOOTNOTES:    [20] Mr. Bates, although eminent as a breeder, was not infallible in  making his selections, and after long continued close breeding, he was  compelled to go out of his own herd to procure breeding animals.    [21] Probably few who have not critically examined the facts regarding  close breeding in the improved Short-horns are aware of the extent to  which it has been carried. On the 28th of March, 1860, at a sale of  Short-horns at Milcote, near Stratford upon Avon (England) thirty-one  descendants of a cow called \"Charmer,\" bred of Mr. Colling's purest  blood, and praised in the advertisement as \"capital milkers and very  prolific, _not having been pampered_,\" sold for L2,140, averaging about  $350 each, and many of them were calves. The stock was also praised as  \"offering to the public as much of the pure blood of 'Favorite' as  could be found in any herd.\" With reference to this sale, which also  comprised other stock, the Agricultural Gazette, published a few days  previous, had some remarks from which the following is extracted:    \"It is unquestionable that the ability of a cow or bull to transmit the  merit either may possess does in a great degree depend upon its having  been inherited by them through a long line of ancestry. Nothing is more  remarkable than the way in which the earlier improvers of the  Short-horn breed carried out their belief in this. They were indeed  driven by the comparative fewness of well bred animals to a repeated  use of the same sire on successive generations of his own begetting,  while breeders now-a-days have the advantage of fifty different strains  and families from which to choose the materials of their herd, but  whether it were necessity or choice it is certain that the pedigree of  no pure bred Short-horn can be traced without very soon reaching many  an illustration of the way in which 'breeding in-and-in' has influenced  its character, deepened it, made it permanent, so that it is handed  down unimpaired and even strengthened in the hands of the judicious  breeder. What an extraordinary influence has thus been exerted by a  single bull on the fortunes of the Short-horn breed! There is hardly a  single choice pure-bred Short-horn that is not descended from  'Favorite' (252) and not only descended in a single line--but descended  in fifty different lines. Take any single animal, and this bull shall  occur in a dozen of its preceding generations and repeatedly up to a  hundred times! in the animals of some of the more distant generations.  His influence is thus so paramount in the breed that one fancies he has  created it and that the present character of the whole breed is due the  'accidental' appearance of an animal of extraordinary endowments on the  stage in the beginning of the present century. And yet this is not  so;--he is himself an illustration of the breeding in-and-in  system--his sire and dam having been half brother and sister, both got  by 'Foljambe.' And this breeding in-and-in has handed down his  influence to the present time in an extraordinary degree. Take for  instance, the cow 'Charmer,' from which as will be seen elsewhere, no  fewer than thirty-one descendants are to be sold next Wednesday. She  had of course two immediate parents, four progenitors in the second  generation, eight in the third, sixteen in the fourth, the number  necessarily doubling each step farther back. Of the eight bulls named  in the fourth generation from which she was descended, one was by  'Favorite.' She is one-sixteenth 'Favorite' on that account, but the  cow to which he was then put was also descended from 'Favorite,' and so  are each of the other seven bulls and seven cows which stand on the  same level of descent with the gr. gr. g. dam of 'Charmer.' And in fact  it will be found on examination that in so far as 'Charmer's' pedigree  is known, which it is in some instances to the sixteenth generation,  she is not one-sixteenth only but nearly nine-sixteenths of pure  Favorite blood. This arises from 'Favorite' having been used repeatedly  on cows descended from himself. In the pedigree of 'Charmer' we  repeatedly meet with 'Comet'--'Comet' was by 'Favorite' and his dam  'Young Phoenix' was also by 'Favorite;' with 'George'--'George' was by  'Favorite' and his dam 'Lady Grace' was also by 'Favorite;' with  'Chilton'--'Chilton' was by 'Favorite' and his dam was also by  'Favorite;' with 'Minor'--'Minor' was by 'Favorite' and his dam also  was by 'Favorite;' with 'Peeress'--she was by 'Favorite' and her dam  also by 'Favorite;' with 'Bright Eyes'--she was by 'Favorite' and her  dam also by 'Favorite;' with 'Strawberry'--she was by 'Favorite' and  her dam by 'Favorite;' 'Dandy,' 'Moss Rose,' among the cows and 'North  Star' among the bulls are also of similar descent.    There is no difficulty therefore in understanding how this name appears  repeatedly in any given generation of the pedigree of any given animal  of the Short-horn breed.\"    [22] Journal Royal Agricultural Society, volume 20, page 297.    [23] It may be said with truth, that the average health and vigor of a  wild herd is much higher than it would be if the feebler portion of the  young were reared, as in a state of domestication, instead of being  destroyed by the stronger, or perishing from hardship; but if close  breeding be, of itself and necessarily, injurious, the whole herd  should gradually fail, which is not found to be the case.          CHAPTER VIII.    CROSSING.      The practice of crossing, like that of close breeding, has its strong  and its weak side. Substantial arguments can be brought both in its  favor and against it. Judiciously practiced, it offers a means of  procuring animals _for the butcher_, often superior to and more  profitable than those of any pure breed. It is also admissible as the  foundation of a systematic and well considered attempt to establish a  new breed. Such attempts, however, as they necessarily involve  considerable expense, and efforts continued during a long term of  years, will be rarely made. But when crossing is practiced  injudiciously and indiscriminately, and especially when so done for  the purpose of procuring _breeding animals_, it cannot be too severely  censured, and is scarcely less objectionable than careless in-and-in  breeding.    The following remarks, from the pen of W.C. Spooner, V.S., are  introduced as sound and reliable, and as comprising nearly all which  need be said on the subject of crossing breeds possessing distinctive  characteristics:        \"Crossing is generally understood to refer to the alliance of      animals of different breeds, such as between a thorough-bred and      a half-bred among horses or a South Down and Leicester among      sheep. Now the advantages or disadvantages of this system depend      entirely on the object we have in view, whether merely to beget      an animal for the butcher, or for the purpose of perpetuating      the species. If the latter is the object, then crossing should      be adopted gradually and with care, and by no means between      distant or antagonistic qualities, as for example a      thorough-bred and a cart-horse. The result of the latter      connection is generally an ill-assorted and unfavorable animal,      too heavy perhaps for one purpose, and too light for another. If      we"]]]
