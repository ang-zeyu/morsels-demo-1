If air bubbles    interfere with the examination, they may be driven off with alcohol,    and then the cover glass put on. If the specimen is mounted in    glycerine, it will keep indefinitely, if care is taken to seal it    up. The plant consists of much-interlaced filaments, divided at    intervals by cross-walls.[6] They are nearly colorless, and the    contents are not conspicuous. These filaments send up vertical    branches (Fig. 39, _A_), that become divided into a series of short    cells by means of cross-walls. The cells thus formed are at first    cylindrical, but later bulge out at the sides, becoming broadly    oval, and finally become detached as spores (_conidia_). It is these    spores that give the frosty appearance to the early stages of the    fungus when seen with the naked eye. The spores fall off very easily    when ripe, and germinate quickly in water, sending out two or more    tubes that grow into filaments like those of the parent plant    (Fig. 39, _B_).    [6] The filaments are attached to the surface of the leaf by suckers,  which are not so readily seen in this species as in some others. A  mildew growing abundantly in autumn on the garden chrysanthemum,  however, shows them very satisfactorily if a bit of the epidermis of a  leaf on which the fungus is just beginning to grow is sliced off with  a sharp razor and mounted in dilute glycerine, or water, removing the  air with alcohol. These suckers are then seen to be globular bodies,  penetrating the outer wall of the cell (Fig. 40).    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Chrysanthemum mildew (_Erysiphe_), showing  the suckers (_h_) by which the filaments are attached to the leaf.  _A_, surface view. _B_, vertical section of the leaf, x 300.]      The spore fruits, as already observed, are formed toward the end of    the season, and, in the species under consideration at least, appear    to be the result of a sexual process. The sexual organs (if they are    really such) are extremely simple, and, owing to their very small    size, are not easily found. They arise as short branches at a point    where two filaments cross; one of them (Fig. 39, _C_, _ar._), the    female cell, or \"archicarp,\" is somewhat larger than the other and    nearly oval in form, and soon becomes separated by a partition from    the filament that bears it. The other branch (antheridium) grows up    in close contact with the archicarp, and like it is shut off by a    partition from its filament. It is more slender than the archicarp,    but otherwise differs little from it. No actual communication can be    shown to be present between the two cells, and it is therefore still    doubtful whether fertilization really takes place. Shortly after    these organs are full-grown, several short branches grow up about    them, and soon completely envelop them (_D_, _E_). These branches    soon grow together, and cross-walls are formed in them, so that the    young spore fruit appears surrounded by a single layer of cells,    sufficiently transparent, however, to allow a view of the interior.      The antheridium undergoes no further change, but the archicarp soon    divides into two cells,--a small basal one and a larger upper cell.    There next grow from the inner surface of the covering cells, short    filaments, that almost completely fill the space between the    archicarp and the wall. An optical section of such a stage (Fig. 39,    _F_) shows a double wall and the two cells of the archicarp. The    spore fruit now enlarges rapidly, and the outer cells become first    yellow and then dark brown, the walls becoming thicker and harder as    they change color. Sometimes special filaments or appendages grow    out from their outer surfaces, and these are also dark-colored.    Shortly before the fruit is ripe, the upper cell of the archicarp,    which has increased many times in size, shows a division of its    contents into eight parts, each of which develops a wall and becomes    an oval spore. By crushing the ripe spore fruit, these spores still    enclosed in the mother cell (ascus) may be forced out (Fig. 39,    _H_). These spores do not germinate at once, but remain dormant    until the next year.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Forms of mildews (_Erysiphe_). _A_,  _Microsphaera_, a spore fruit, x 150. _B_, cluster of spore sacs of the  same, x 150. _C_, a single appendage, x 300. _D_, end of an appendage  of _Uncinula_, x 300. _E_, appendage of _Phyllactinia_, x 150.]      Frequently other structures, resembling somewhat the spore fruits,    are found associated with them (Fig. 39, _I_, _K_), and were for a    long time supposed to be a special form of reproductive organ; but    they are now known to belong to another fungus (_Cicinnobulus_),    parasitic upon the mildew. They usually appear at the base of the    chains of conidia, causing the basal cell to enlarge to many times    its original size, and finally kill the young conidia, which shrivel    up. A careful examination reveals the presence of very fine    filaments within those of the mildew, which may be traced up to the    base of the conidial branch, where the receptacle of the parasite is    forming. The spores contained in these receptacles are very small    (Fig. 39, _K_), and when ripe exude in long, worm-shaped masses, if    the receptacle is placed in water.    The mildews may be divided into two genera: _Podosphaera_, with a  single ascus in the spore fruit; and _Erysiphe_, with two or more. In  the latter the archicarp branches, each branch bearing a spore sac  (Fig. 41, _B_).    The appendages growing out from the wall of the spore fruit are often  very beautiful in form, and the two genera given above are often  subdivided according to the form of these appendages.    A common mould closely allied to the mildews is found on various  articles of food when allowed to remain damp, and is also very common  on botanical specimens that have been poorly dried, and hence is often  called \"herbarium mould\" (_Eurotium herbariorum_).    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--_A_, spore bearing filament of the herbarium  mould (_Eurotium_), x 150. _B_, _C_, another species showing the way  in which the spores are borne--optical section--x 150. _D_, spore  fruit of the herbarium mould, x 150. _E_, spore sac. _F_, spores,  x 300. _G_, spore-bearing filament of the common blue mould  (_Penicillium_), x 300. _sp._ the spores.]      The conidia are of a greenish color, and produced on the ends of    upright branches which are enlarged at the end, and from which grow    out little prominences, which give rise to the conidia in the same    way as we have seen in the mildews (Fig. 42, _A_).      Spore fruits much like those of the mildews are formed later, and    are visible to the naked eye as little yellow grains (Fig. 42, _D_).    These contain numerous very small spore sacs (_E_), each with eight    spores.    There are numerous common species of _Eurotium_, differing in color  and size, some being yellow or black, and larger than the ordinary  green form.    Another form, common everywhere on mouldy food of all kinds, as well  as in other situations, is the blue mould (_Penicillium_). This, in  general appearance, resembles almost exactly the herbarium mould, but  is immediately distinguishable by a microscopic examination (Fig. 42,  _G_).      In studying all of these forms, they may be mounted, as directed for    the black moulds, in dilute glycerine; but must be handled with    great care, as the spores become shaken off with the slightest jar.    Of the larger _Ascomycetes_, the cup fungi (_Discomycetes_) may be  taken as types. The spore fruit in these forms is often of  considerable size, and, as their name indicates, is open, having the  form of a flat disc or cup. A brief description of a common one will  suffice to give an idea of their structure and development.    _Ascobolus_ (Fig. 43) is a small, disc-shaped fungus, growing on horse  dung. By keeping some of this covered with a bell jar for a week or  two, so as to retain the moisture, at the end of this time a large  crop of the fungus will probably have made its appearance. The part  visible is the spore fruit (Fig. 43, _A_), of a light brownish color,  and about as big as a pin-head.      Its development may be readily followed by teasing out in water the    youngest specimens that can be found, taking care to take up a    little of the substratum with it, as the earliest stages are too    small to be visible to the naked eye. The spore fruits arise from    filaments not unlike those of the mildews, and are preceded by the    formation of an archicarp composed of several cells, and readily    seen through the walls of the young fruit (Fig. 43, _B_). In the    study of the early stages, a potash solution will be found useful in    rendering them transparent.      The young fruit has much the same structure as that of the mildews,    but the spore sacs are much more numerous, and there are special    sterile filaments developed between them. If the young spore fruit    is treated with chlor-iodide of zinc, it is rendered quite    transparent, and the young spore sacs colored a beautiful blue, so    that they are readily distinguishable.

I received a private letter From Sir Stratford Canning, dated  Constantinople, March 23, announcing the termination of his  negotiation with the Turkish Government as to its future conduct in  the cases of Christians who have renounced the Mahomedan religion,  and bearing witness to the cordial manner in which M. de Le Coq, the  Prussian Minister, under Baron Bülow's instruction, had assisted his  exertions.    I thought it my duty to communicate this feeling to Baron Bülow, who  has expressed himself obliged by the expressions of Sir Stratford  Canning, and most happy to have contributed to so good a work as the  attainment of a written pledge from the Turkish Government that it  will take effectual means to prevent henceforward the execution of  the Christian who is an apostate.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) WESTMORLAND.              No. 38.      _Lord Cowley to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received April_ 17.)    My Lord,                          _Paris, April_ 15, 1844.    At the desire of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople I have  the honour to forward to your Lordship copies of a despatch and of  its inclosures which his Excellency has addressed to me in  consequence of the acquiescence of the Porte in the representations  of Great Britain and France on the subject of the execution of  apostates from Islamism.    M. Guizot read to me yesterday Baron de Bourqueney's report  announcing the successful termination of these negotiations, and  expressing his entire satisfaction at the assurances afforded him by  the Sultan, at the audience to which His Majesty has been graciously  pleased to invite him, of his determination to adhere strictly to  the engagements he had entered into with the two Powers.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) COWLEY.    Inclosure 1 in No. 38.    _Sir Stratford Canning to Lord Cowley_.    My Lord,                          _Constantinople, March_ 27, 1844.    As the question relating to the execution of apostates from Islamism  is now successfully terminated, it will be satisfactory for your  Lordship to learn that the entire approbation expressed by M. Guizot  of the instructions addressed to me on the 16th of January by the  Earl of Aberdeen, procured me the active support of Baron de  Bourqueney throughout the late negotiations with the Porte, and that  by acting separately, according to M. Guizot's suggestion, I was  enabled to give the fullest effect to my instructions, marked and  decisive as they were, without losing any part of the advantage  derived from the French Minister's concurrence.    Together we rejected the unsatisfactory answer at first and more  than once proposed by the Porte; together we accepted what appeared  to offer a sufficient guarantee for the accomplishment of our common  object.    The terms in which the final declaration of the Porte was conveyed  to us on the 21st instant, are recorded in the accompanying paper  translated exactly from the Turkish original.    I thought it advisable to acknowledge this communication, and as I  was entitled to expect some additional assurances from the Sultan at  the public audience which I had demanded of His Majesty according to  my instructions, I avoided embarrassing the French Minister by  proposing to him to take part in a step which related exclusively to  my position. A copy of this acknowledgment is inclosed herewith; and  in order to give your Lordship a complete view of the transaction in  its full extent, I add the very terms, as translated to me, in which  the Sultan was pleased to confirm and to enlarge the engagement of  his Government.    I may venture to add that His Majesty's assurances were given in the  most gracious form, accompanied with an expression of thanks for the  liberal manner in which the millions of Mahomedan subjects in India  are treated by the British authorities, and followed by a message,  after I had left his presence, to the effect that the sentiments  which he had declared to me were not only those of the Monarch but  of the individual.    In short, my Lord, I am sanguine enough to hope that Her Majesty's  Government have laid the foundation of a more real improvement in  the temper and policy of this State than was to have been previously  expected; and it is a subject of just congratulation that the  counsels of two great nations have united successfully for the  attainment of so beneficent an object.    The invitation to Baron de Bourqueney to wait upon the Sultan the  day after my audience, and to receive, for the information of his  Court, a repetition of the assurances addressed to me, affords  another proof of His Majesty's sincerity.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.    P.S.--I request that a copy of this despatch and its inclosures may  be forwarded immediately to Her Majesty's Government.    S. C.

The concession made by the Porte in this respect,  entirely consistent as it is with the wishes and intentions of Her  Majesty's Government, as expressed in my several instructions of the  16th of January, 19th of March, and 6th of April, has given them the  greatest satisfaction; and I have been happy to receive the Queen's  commands to signify to your Excellency Her Majesty's gracious  approbation of the manner in which you have executed your  instructions, and brought to a successful close a question of which  the importance cannot be too highly rated."]]]
