Some, as you will see, are tanned by being suspended from  a bar into a vat of quebracho. Others are put into wheels of chrome tan  just as calfskins are. White leathers are tanned, or more properly  speaking tawed, in a mixture of alum and egg-yolk.\"    \"Egg-yolk!\" gasped Peter. \"Eggs--such as we eat?\"    \"I am not so sure that they are such as you would care to eat,\" grinned  the man, \"but the yolks come from eggs, nevertheless.\"    \"I should think it would take lots of men to break the eggs fast enough  and get them ready,\" murmured Peter, half aloud.    \"Bless your heart! We don't break the eggs here!\" roared the workman,  shaking with laughter. \"No, indeed. We get egg-yolk by the barrel; when  we pour it out it looks like thin yellow paint. We tan kid for gloves in  egg-yolk,\" he went on, observing that both Nat and Peter were much  interested. \"After sheepskins are tanned the leather must all be  fat-liquored, dried by steam or air fans, dampened, split or shaved off  to uniform thickness, dyed in revolving paddle-wheels filled with color,  and tacked on boards to dry just as calfskins are. The chemists who  have laboratories up-stairs test the dyes and mix or match the colors  for us. Then the skins go to the various rooms for the different  finishes. And speaking of finishes, I suppose you went into the  buffing-room in the other factory.\"    \"No,\" said Peter, \"we didn't--at least I didn't.\"    \"Nor I,\" put in Nat. \"The door was always closed and no one was  admitted.\"    \"They don't like to have people go in if they can help it because every  time the door is opened it stirs things up; but I can take you into our  buffing-room if you want to go.\"    \"I wish you would,\" cried Peter.    Accordingly all went up-stairs and their guide cautiously pushed open a  door on which NO ADMITTANCE was scrawled in large letters. The moment  Peter squeezed through it he drew in his breath and then regretted that  he had done so, for he at once began to cough.    The boys glanced about the room before them.    Every window was closed, making the air hot and stuffy; yet, Peter asked  himself, how was such a condition to be avoided in a place where it was  evident that even the tiniest draught must create instant havoc? This  room which Peter and Nat surveyed was thick with flying white particles  that were being whirled into space from rapidly turning emery wheels.  The workmen who were busy buffing the flesh side of split skins in order  to get the rough surface required for a suede finish seemed enveloped in  a miniature blizzard. As the swiftly turning discs sent clouds of white  dust into the air it settled on the hair, faces, eyelashes, and clothing  until the laborers looked like snow men moving amid the blinding flakes  of an old-fashioned storm. Peter and Nat, who looked on, began to be  changed into snow men, too.    \"I guess you don't want to stay in here long,\" announced their guide,  raising his voice to be heard above the noise of the revolving wheels.  \"As you see, they are making 'suede,' or ooze finished leather. Some  calfskins are finished this way too, as of course you know. A certain  amount of this leather will be left white for gloves or shoes; more of  it, however, will be stretched on boards and brushed over with some  colored dye. Suede is made in all sorts of fancy shades for women's  party slippers.\"    Peter nodded and then, quite without warning, he sneezed.    Immediately a cloud of whiteness shot into the air.    \"Hurry! Let's get out!\" cried Nat. \"I'm going to sneeze, too.\"    The man who was conducting them opened the door a crack and they all  three slipped through. Safe in the outer room they stopped and  laughingly surveyed one another. All were as white as if sprinkled with  powder.    \"Goodness!\" Peter exclaimed, rubbing his eyelashes. \"How can those men  breathe? I should think that in a day they would swallow enough dust to  fill their lungs up solid.\"    \"They don't mind it.\"    \"Well, I only hope we shan't be put in there to work.\"    \"So do I!\" was Nat's fervent rejoinder.    Fortunately for the boys they escaped doing duty in the buffing-room.  Instead they worked throughout the year in the beamhouse and the  different finishing departments of Factory 2. Although this factory was  known as the sheepskin tannery they soon found that the skins of lambs,  kids, and goats were also tanned and finished there. The skins of the  young kids or goats were much too delicate for shoes and were made into  thin flexible leather for kid gloves; the leather commonly known as kid  and used for shoes was not really kid at all, the boys were told, but  the skin of mature goats. Inquiry also brought forth the surprising  information that there were between sixty and seventy different kinds of  goatskin, the thickness and grain of the material depending on the  climate and the conditions under which the animals had been raised. Some  of these skins were imported from Brazil, some from Buenos Ayres,  Mexico, France, Russia, India, China, Tripoli, or Arabia.    Goat breeders, the foreman said, killed their flocks at the season of  the year when the men who collected skins made their rounds. These  collectors went from one station to another and the goat herders,  carrying bundles of skins on their backs, went down to the station  nearest the hill country in which they were grazing their flocks and  sold their stock to the collector, who promptly paid them in cash. When  the collector had bought all the skins he wished he had them baled and  sent them across country to the nearest seaport from which they were  shipped to America. Many of the skins coming from India and Russia were  sent first to London and then reshipped to the United States.    All goatskins, of no matter what variety, were tanned by the chrome  process, and because they were smaller and of lighter weight than hides,  tanned much more quickly. They were finished in many different ways:  glazed kid, which was made in colors as well as black, had a shiny  surface made by \"striking\" or burnishing the leather on the grain side;  mat kid, soft and dull, was treated with oil and wax; suede kid was made  in fancy colors for party shoes. These were some of the most important  varieties. Then there was buckskin, the skin of the reindeer, most  frequently buffed and finished in colors for gloves, or in white for  shoes. Kangaroo was also classed under the head of kid.    \"Is patent kid finished in this factory?\" inquired Peter one day.    \"No. All the patent leathers--both patent kid and patent calf--have a  factory all to themselves.\"    \"I'd like to see it.\"    \"Oh, you will some day, no doubt. I hear they need a new boss over  there. The men hate Tolman. Who knows but you may get his job!\"    Peter laughed, and so did the other men who chanced to be standing  about.    \"I guess there is no danger that Tolman will lose his place on my  account,\" replied the boy with no little amusement.    Many months later when Peter met Tolman he recalled this incident and  understood more fully why the men disliked him and felt that the patent  leather factory needed a new head.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VIII    A NARROW ESCAPE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES      All this time, strangely enough, no hint of Peter Strong's identity had  become known. It was little short of a miracle that it should not have  been discovered. Many circumstances, however, fostered the secret. In  the first place none of the men from the tanneries ever came to the  fashionable west side of the town; there was nothing to call them there.  Had they come the chances were that they would probably at some time  have encountered Peter in company with his father and mother driving,  motoring, or going to church. Several school friends had, it is true,  unearthed the interesting information that Peter was \"working,\" but the  discovery was greeted with but scant curiosity. One's place in life  closes up very quickly after one drops from sight. When the idol of the  Milburn ball team had vanished it had caused great agitation and for a  brief interval he had been sincerely mourned; then some one else had  been raised up to fill the gap, life was readjusted, and soon Peter and  his glorious record were forgotten.    Under other conditions this lack of loyalty on the part of his friends  would have wounded Peter sorely; now, however, the feeling was one of  mortified pride rather than pained regret. His own attitude toward his  former comrades had also in the meantime undergone a change. The boys he  had looked up to, even the wisest of the seniors, seemed to him very  young indeed, and their football worries pitiably unimportant. They were  but preparing for the real work of the world while Peter, and others  like him, were actually doing it. In consequence not a lad among all his  former classmates was half so companionable or congenial as was his new  friend, Nat Jackson.    And so, as the months sped past and Peter's second year in the tannery  neared its end, he found himself not only content with the present life  but more and more absorbed in each fresh experience of leather making.  The bond with the Jackson home strengthened, and the desire to make good  at his \"job\" drove him to throw all the interest and power of his strong  young life into his task.    Winter had added many facts to his growing knowledge about leather. Up  to February he and Nat had been together in the beamhouse and seen the  great care which was taken that the freshly tanned skins should not  freeze. Fortunately for the Coddington Company most of their buildings  were new and were equipped with steam-heated lofts where drying could be  accomplished with little trouble; but one or two of the old buildings  had shutters and in consequence were dependent upon drying the wet skins  in the outer air. If the leather was allowed to freeze its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#14)"],[1,"knee-deep. On the following  day he went in search of the aboriginals, and met a party of about  twenty women, together with a number of children. With these he soon  contrived to be on friendly terms; and after he had distributed among  them looking-glasses, blankets, handkerchiefs, apples and sugar, he left  them very well satisfied.      #5. The Yarra.# A day or two later the _Rebecca_ anchored in Hobson's Bay,  in front of the ti-tree scrub and the lonely shores where now the  streets of Williamstown extend in all directions. Batman again started  on foot to explore that river whose mouth lay there in front of him.  With fourteen men, all well armed, he passed up the river banks; but,  being on the left side, he naturally turned up that branch which is  called the Saltwater, instead of the main stream. After two days of  walking through open grassy lands, admirably suited for sheep, they  reached the site of Sunbury. From a hill at that place they could see  fires about twenty miles to the south-east; and, as they were anxious to  meet the natives, they bent their steps in that direction till they  overtook a native man, with his wife and three children. To his great  satisfaction, he learnt that these people knew of his friendly meeting  with the women in the Geelong district. They guided him to the banks of  the Merri Creek, to the place where their whole tribe was encamped. He  stayed with them all night, sleeping in a pretty grassy hollow beside  the stream. In the morning he offered to buy a portion of their land,  and gave them a large quantity of goods, consisting of scissors, knives,  blankets, looking-glasses, and articles of this description. In return,  they granted him all the land stretching from the Merri Creek to  Geelong. Batman had the documents drawn up, and on the Northcote Hill,  overlooking the grass-covered flats of Collingwood and the sombre  forests of Carlton and Fitzroy, the natives affixed their marks to the  deeds, by which Batman fancied he was legally put in possession of  600,000 acres. Trees were cut with notches, in order to fix the  boundaries, and in the afternoon Batman took leave of his black friends.  He had not gone far before he was stopped by a large swamp, and so slept  for the night under the great gum trees which then spread their shade  over the ground now covered by the populous streets of West Melbourne.  In the morning he found his way round the swamp, and in trying to reach  the Saltwater came upon a noble stream, which was afterwards called the  Yarra. In the evening he reached his vessel in the bay. Next day he  ascended the Yarra in a boat; and when he came to the Yarra Falls, he  wrote in his diary, \"This will be the place for a village,\" unconscious  that he was gazing upon the site of a great and busy city. Returning to  Indented Head, near the heads of Port Phillip, he left three white men  and his Sydney natives to cultivate the soil and retain possession of  the land he supposed himself to have purchased. Then he set sail for  Tasmania, where he and his associates began to prepare for transporting  their households, their sheep and their cattle, to the new country.      #6. The Henty Brothers.#--But even earlier than this period a quiet  settlement had been made in the western parts of Victoria. There, as  early as 1828, sealers had dwelt at Portland Bay, had built their little  cottages and formed their little gardens. But they were unauthorised,  and could only be regarded by the British Government as intruders,  having no legal right to the land they occupied. In 1834, however, there  came settlers of another class--Edward, Stephen, and Frank Henty. Their  father--a man of some wealth--had in 1828 emigrated with all his family  to Western Australia, carrying with him large quantities of fine stock.  But the settlement at Swan River proving a failure, he had removed to  Tasmania, where his six sons all settled. Very soon they found the  pastoral lands of Tasmania too limited, and as Edward Henty had in one  of his coasting voyages seen the sealers at Portland Bay and noticed how  numerous the whales were in that bay, and how fine the grassy lands that  lay within, he chartered a vessel, the _Thistle_, and crossed in her to  settle at Portland Bay with servants, sheep, cattle, and horses.    [Illustration: EDWARD HENTY.]    The land was all that had been anticipated, and soon Frank, and then  Stephen, arrived, with more stock and more men to tend them. Houses and  stores were put up, and fields were ploughed. Ere long other settlers  followed, and in the course of five or six years all the district lying  inland from Portland Bay was well settled and covered with sheep, while  at Portland Bay itself so many whales were caught that there were not  tanks enough to hold the oil, and much of it was wasted. The English  Government after some delay agreed to sell land to the settlers, and  before 1840 a thriving little town stood on the shores of Portland Bay.      [Illustration: JOHN PASCOE FAWKNER.]    #7. Fawkner.#--John Pascoe Fawkner, who, as a boy, had landed at Sorrento  in 1803, had grown up to manhood in Tasmania through stormy times, and  had at length settled down as an innkeeper in Launceston; with that  business, however, combining the editing and publishing of a small  newspaper. For he was always a busy and active-minded worker, and had  done a great deal to make up for the defective education of his earlier  years. When Batman arrived in Launceston with the news of the fine  pastoral country across the water, Fawkner became quite excited at the  prospects that seemed possible over there. He accordingly began to  agitate for the formation of another association, and five members  joined him. At his expense, the schooner _Enterprise_ was chartered and  loaded with all things necessary for a small settlement. On the 27th  July, 1835, he set sail from Launceston; but the weather was so rough  that, after three days and two nights of inexpressible sickness, Fawkner  found himself still in sight of the Tasmanian coast. He therefore asked  to be put ashore, and left Captain Lancey to manage the trip as he  thought best. The captain took the vessel over to Western Port, as had  been originally arranged; but the land there was not nearly so good as  they understood it to be in the Port Phillip district. So they sailed  round and safely anchored in Hobson's Bay, bringing with them horses and  ploughs, grain, fruit trees, materials for a house, boats, provisions,  and, indeed, everything that a small settlement could want. Getting out  their boat, they entered upon the stream which they saw before them;  but, unfortunately, they turned up the wrong arm, and, after rowing many  miles, were forced to turn back, the water all the way being salt and  unfit for drinking. For this reason they called this stream the  Saltwater; but next morning they started again and tried the other  branch. After pulling for about an hour and a half they reached a basin  in the river whose beauty filled them with exultation and delight. A  rocky ledge over which the river flowed kept the water above it fresh;  the soil was rich, and covered with splendid grass, and they instantly  came to the conclusion to settle in this favoured spot. Next day they  towed the vessel up, and landed where the Custom House now is. At night  they slept beside the falls, where the air was fragrant with the sweet  scent of the wattle trees just bursting into bloom.    They had not been on the river many days before Mr. Wedge--one of  Batman's party--in crossing the country from Indented Head to the Yarra,  was astonished to see the masts of a vessel rising amid the gum trees.  On reaching the river bank, what was his surprise to find, in that  lonely spot, a vessel almost embedded in the woods, and the rocks and  glades echoing to the sound of hammer and saw and the encouraging shouts  of the ploughmen! Wedge informed Fawkner's party that they were  trespassers on land belonging to John Batman and Company. Captain  Lancey, having heard the story of the purchase, declared that such a  transaction could have no value. When Wedge was gone, the settlers laid  their axes to the roots of the trees, and began to clear the land for  extensive cultivation. A fortnight later Wedge brought round all his  party from Indented Head in order to occupy what Batman had marked as  the site for a village, and the two rival parties were encamped side by  side where the western part of Collins Street now stands. A little later  Fawkner arrived with further settlers and with a wooden house, which he  soon erected by the banks of the Yarra, the first regularly built house  of Melbourne. He placed it by the side of the densely wooded stream,  which was afterwards turned into Elizabeth Street. Great crowds of black  and white cockatoos raised their incessant clamour at the first strokes  of the axe; but soon the hillside was clear, and man had taken permanent  possession of the spot.      #8. William Buckley.#--Meanwhile a circumstance had happened which  favoured Batman's party in no small degree. The men left at Indented  Head were surprised one morning to see an extremely tall figure  advancing towards them. His hair was thickly matted; his skin was brown,  but not black, like that of the natives; he was almost naked, and he  carried the ordinary arms of the aborigines. This was William Buckley,  the only survivor of the three convicts who had escaped from Governor  Collins's expedition. He had dwelt for thirty-two years among the  natives. During this long time he had experienced many strange  adventures, but had not exercised the smallest influence for good upon  the natives. He was content to sink at once to their level, and to lead  the purely animal life they led. But when he heard that there was a  party of whites on Indented Head, whom the Geelong tribes proposed to  murder, he crossed to warn them of"]]]
