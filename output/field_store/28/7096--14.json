The poor subjects of His Majesty, driven from home by distress, to whom  portions of land are granted, can now find in the grant no benefit; and  Loyalists of the United Empire--the descendants of those who sacrificed  their all in America in behalf of British rule--men whose names were  ordered on record for their virtuous adherence to your Royal Father--the  descendants of these men find now no favour in their destined rewards;  nay, these rewards, when granted, have in many cases been rendered worse  than nothing, for the legal rights in the enjoyment of them have been  held at nought; their land has been rendered unsaleable, and, in some  cases, only a source of distraction and care. Under this system of  internal management, and weakened from other evil influences, Upper  Canada now pines in comparative decay; discontent and poverty are  experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature; dread  of arbitrary power wars, here, against the free exercise of reason and  manly sentiment; laws have been set aside; legislators have come into  derision; and contempt from the mother-country seems fast gathering  strength to disunite the people of Canada from their friends at home.\"  Notwithstanding these long, involved, awkwardly-constructed sentences,  there is no more accurate picture to be found anywhere of the effect of  the pernicious administration of affairs in the Public Lands Office at  York in 1818. Twenty years later Lord Durham found it not much  improved.[40]    Another hydra-headed monster which ate into the very vitals of the  commonwealth was the provision for the clergy, known as the Clergy  Reserves. This was perhaps the greatest of all the curses imposed upon  Upper Canada by the Constitutional Act, for its ill effects were both  direct and incidental. It not only tended to stop the march of progress,  but it created a degree of sectarian animosity and hatred little  calculated to inspire respect for Christianity in the breasts of the  secular portion of the community, and it disturbed the public  tranquillity for nearly two generations.    By the thirty-sixth section of the Act of 1791, power was given to  reserve out of all future grants of land in Upper and Lower Canada, as  well as in respect of all past grants, an allotment for the support of  \"a Protestant Clergy.\" It was provided that this allotment should be  \"equal in value to the seventh part of the lands so granted.\" By the  thirty-seventh section, the rents, profits and emoluments arising from  the lands so appropriated were to be applicable solely to the  maintenance and support of a Protestant Clergy. By subsequent sections  provision was made for the erection and endowment by the  Lieutenant-Governor, under instructions from the Crown, of parsonages or  rectories, one or more in every township or parish, according to the  establishment of the Church of England, and for the presentation of  incumbents, subject to the bishop's right of institution. By section  forty-two it was enacted that no Provincial statute varying or repealing  these provisions should receive the royal assent until thirty days after  it had been laid before both Houses of Parliament in Great Britain.  These famous enactments were destined to produce more discord and  heartburning than all the other clauses of the Constitutional Act  combined. They were destined to make the Church of England more  cordially detested in this Province by persons without the pale of her  communion than she has ever been in any other part of the world. They  were destined to set one Legislative faction against another in such  fierce array that the public business frequently had to be suspended.  They were destined to divide the Provincial population into two hostile  camps, each filled with envy, malice and all uncharitableness towards  the other. They were destined to be the key-note of general elections,  and to shape the policy of successive Administrations. They were  destined to be the chief factor in bringing about a Rebellion which for  a time seriously disturbed the industries of the Province; which filled  the Provincial jails with suffering prisoners; which consigned a number  of persons to a premature and ignominous death; which brought sorrow  and ruin to many a once happy fireside; which bequeathed a legacy of  hatred to the children of those who took part in it; and which seriously  disturbed the international amity between Great Britain and the United  States.    It may be doubted whether all the ill effects of these appropriations  were foreseen by their promoters in the early years of our history. It  was at all events some time before those effects began to be apparent to  the people generally. In making the appropriations, care was taken that  the reserved lands should be intermixed with grants to actual settlers,  whereby they were spread over a large area; the manifest intention being  to increase their value by their proximity to cultivated farms, and at  the same time to create a tenantry in the settled townships, with a view  to the creation of parishes and the endowment of rectories. In several  portions of the Province, however, it was impossible to follow this  plan. Much of the Niagara peninsula had been granted to Butler's Rangers  before the passing of the Constitutional Act. In like manner, certain  townships along the north bank of the St. Lawrence, as well as several  portions of the Western District, had been granted to other United  Empire Loyalists. In none of these cases had any reservations been made,  and the lands had already become vested in the grantees. The  appropriators accordingly set apart large tracts of aggregated  reservations in contiguous townships which were yet unsettled. The  prejudicial results soon began to appear. Huge tracts of reserves  interposed themselves between one settler and another, enhancing the  difficulties of communication and transportation, and hindering or  altogether preventing that cooeperation of labour which is essential to  the prosperity of pioneer settlements. The inhabitants, instead of being  drawn together, were isolated from one another, and combination for  municipal or other public purposes was rendered all but impracticable.  They were kept remote from a market for the sale of their produce, cut  off from the privileges of public worship and public education for their  children; deprived, in a word, of the blessings of civilization.  Settlement was seriously obstructed, and the industrious immigrant was  to a great extent paralyzed by his surroundings.    The evils arising out of these Clergy Reserves were intensified by the  unfair and illegal manner in which the appropriations were made. It has  been seen that by the Act of 1791 the land reserved for the clergy was  to be equal to one-seventh of all grants made by the Crown. One-seventh  of all grants would obviously be one-eighth of the whole. Yet, instead  of acting on this self-evident proposition, it was the practice of those  to whom the duty of reservation was entrusted to set apart for the  clergy one-seventh of _all_ the land, which was equal to a sixth of the  land granted. The surplus thus unjustly appropriated on behalf of the  clergy had in 1838 footed up to a total of three hundred thousand acres.  The excess was confined to about two-thirds of the surveyed townships,  from which circumstance, as well as from the obvious construction of the  statute, it is to be inferred that the excessive reservations were made  deliberately, and not from mere oversight or inadvertence.[41]    As the Province increased in population, and as land advanced in value,  the grievance became more and more manifest. The growl of discontent  began to be heard, and the people began to combine against the  intolerable evil. This, at first, was chiefly due to the purely secular  reasons above indicated. By degrees, however, the sectarian element was  developed, and the growl of discontent became a roar of opposition. A  dominant church was not acceptable to the Dissenters[42] who composed  the bulk of the population; yet it was contended by those in  authority--all of whom were Episcopalians--that the Clergy Reserves were  the exclusive domain of the Church of England. It must be conceded that  there was some ground for this contention, and that the question was not  quite free from doubt. The Act authorizing the setting apart of the  Reserves had appropriated them for the maintenance and support of \"a  Protestant Clergy.\" The word \"clergy\" was not commonly applied in those  days to dissenting ministers of religion. It had never been used in any  English statute to designate any ministers except those of the Church of  Rome and the Church of England. The Church of Rome being excluded by the  term \"Protestant,\" it was contended that the provision had been for the  exclusive benefit of the Church of England, more especially as the  creation and endowment of parsonages and rectories--which are  institutions peculiar to the Church of England--had been expressly  provided for by the same Act. Such was the plea put forward on behalf of  the Church of England. Dissenters took a different view. They argued  that the term \"Protestant Clergy\" had been used in the Act in mere  contradistinction to the clergy of the Church of Rome. They further  urged that the limited construction sought to be put upon the term by  the Anglicans was plainly negatived by the thirty-ninth section of the  Act, wherein the words \"incumbent or minister of the Church of England\"  were expressly employed. Such terms, it was said, would not have been  used by the framers of the Act if they had regarded them as synonymous  with \"Protestant Clergy,\" as used in other clauses. \"The manifest  intention of the Act,\" said the Dissenters, \"was to provide for a  _Protestant_--as distinguished from a _Roman Catholic_--clergy.

Now there is       train all the way. It must be supported by agricultural produce.       Such wealth of fertility I never saw. I think, standing at any       point in the great haugh of the Danube, I could see as much grain       as all Scotland could produce.
