The king and queen, looking out of the palace  windows, are _almost_ on the same scale as the figures in the  foreground; the walls of the houses, roofs, etc., have apparently quite  as much projection as the foreground rocks--distance is inferred rather  than expressed. The very simple construction, too, is worth noting. It  is practically composed of three boards, a wide one for the picture, and  two narrower ones for ends and feet.    The object in making these sketches should be mainly to collect a  variety of ideas which may brighten the mind when there is occasion to  use its inventive faculties. Suggestive hints are wanted; rarely will it  be possible, or wise, to repeat anything exactly as you see it. These  sketches, if made with care, and from what Constable used to call  \"breeding subjects,\" will give your fancy a very necessary point of  vantage, from which it may hazard flights of its own.    As much of our knowledge must necessarily be gained from museums, and as  they now form such an important feature of educational machinery, I  think it will be well to devote a word or two of special notice to the  drawbacks which accompany their many advantages. This I propose to do in  the following chapter.          CHAPTER XVI    MUSEUMS           False Impressions Fostered by Fragmentary Exhibits--Environment as       Important as Handicraft--Works Viewed as Records of       Character--Carvers the Historians of their Time.      A new world of commerce and machinery, having slain and forgotten a past  race of artist craftsmen, makes clumsy atonement by sweeping together  the fragments of their work and calling the collection a museum. From  the four corners of the earth these relics have been gathered. Our  hungry minds are bidden to make choice according to fancy, for here is  variety of food! Here are opportunities, never before enjoyed by mortal,  for an intellectual feast!--and of a kind which might be considered  god-like, were it not for the suspicion of some gigantic joke. That out  of all this huge mass of chaotic material we have not as yet been able  to make for ourselves some living form of art, must indeed be to the  gods a continual subject of merriment.    Museums of art are in no respect the unmixed blessings which they appear  to be. They have, to be sure, all the advantages of handy reference;  but at the same time, on account of the great diversity in the character  of their exhibits, they tend to encourage the spread of a patchy kind of  knowledge, far from being helpful to the arts in the interests of which  they are established. It must be remembered that, in these collections,  all specimens of architecture and architectural carving are invariably  seen in false positions. All have been wrenched from their proper  settings, and placed, more or less at random, in lights and  relationships never contemplated by their designers. To the environment  of a piece of architecture, and the position and surroundings of carved  decorations, are due quite half of their interest as works of art.  Deprive them of these associations, and little is left but fragmentary  specimens of handicraft, more or less unintelligible in their lonely  detachment, misleading to the eye, and dangerous as objects of  imitation, in proportion to the dependence they once had upon those  absent and unknown associations.    The educational purpose which these collections are intended to serve is  liable to be construed into an unreasoning assumption that every  specimen exhibited is equally worthy of admiration. How often the  plodding student is to be seen carefully drawing and measuring work of  the dullest imaginable quality, with no other apparent reason for his  pathetically wasted industry!    It would be strange, indeed, if all in this vast record of past activity  was of equal value; if merely to belong to the past was a sure warrant  that such work was the best of its kind. Far from this being the case,  it requires the constant use of a more or less trained and critical  judgment to separate what is good from the indifferent or really bad in  these collections, for all are usually present. There is inequality in  artistic powers, in technical skill, and a distinction of yet greater  importance, which lies in the significance the works bear as records of  the inner life of their creators. Artists, carvers in particular, are  the true scribes and historians of their times. Their works are, as it  were, books--written in words of unconscious but fateful meaning. Some  are filled with the noblest ideals, expressed in beautiful and serious  language, while others contain nothing but sorry jests and stupidities.    As all the works of the past, whether good or bad, are the achievements  of men differing but little from ourselves, save in the direction of  their energies and in their outward surroundings, there is surely some  clue to the secret of their success or failure, some light to be thrown  by their experience upon our own dubious and questioning spirit.    What better could we look for in this respect than a little knowledge of  the lives led by the carvers themselves, a mental picture of their  environment, an acquired sense of the influence which this, that, or the  other set of conditions must have imposed upon their work. With a little  aid from history in forming our judgments, their works themselves will  assist us--so faithful is the transcript of their witness--for, with  more certainty than applies to handwriting, a fair guess may be made by  inference from the work itself as to the general status and ideals of  the workman. The striking analogy between its salient characteristics  and the prevailing mood of that ever-changing spirit which seeks  expression in the arts, is nowhere more marked than in the work of the  carver.          CHAPTER XVII    STUDIES FROM NATURE--FOLIAGE           Medieval and Modern Choice of Form Compared--A Compromise       Adopted--A List of Plant Forms of Adaptable Character.      It is high time now that we had some talk about the studies from nature  which are to furnish you with subjects for your work. I shall at present  deal only with studies of foliage, as that is what you have been  practising, and I wish you to carry on your work and studies as much as  possible on the same lines.    Between the few abstract forms, representing a general type of foliage,  so dear to the heart of the medieval carver, and the unstinted variety  of choice displayed in the works of Grinling Gibbons and his time, there  is such a wide difference that surely it points to a corresponding  disparity of aim. Although there is no doubt whatever that such a  striking change of views must have had its origin in some deeper cause  than that which is to be explained by artistic and technical  development, yet I think that for our immediate purpose we shall find a  sufficiently good lesson in comparing the visible results of the two  methods. Broadly speaking, then, the medieval carver cared more for  general effect than for possibilities of technique. He therefore chose  only such natural forms as were amenable to his preconceived  determination to make his work telling at a distance. He had no  botanical leanings, and rejected as unfit every form which would not  bend to his one purpose--that of decoration on a large scale--and which  he aimed at making comprehensive at a glance, rather than calling for  attention to its details. He invented patterns which he knew would  assist in producing this result, and here he further handicapped his  choice by limiting it to such forms as would repeat or vanish at  regulated intervals, reflecting light or producing shadow just where it  was wanted to emphasize his pattern.    The more modern carver, on the contrary, offered an all-embracing  welcome to every form which presented itself to his notice. He rejected  nothing which could by any possibility be carved. Nothing was too small,  too thin, or too difficult for his wonderful dexterity with the carving  tools. His chief end was elaboration of detail, and it was often  carried to a point which ignored the fact that nearly all of it would  become invisible when in position, or, if seen at all, would only appear  in confused lumps and unintelligible masses.    Now, for many reasons, I think we had better take the medieval method as  our model up to a point, and make a certain selection of material for  our studies, based upon some relation to general effect, but not  necessarily imitating a medieval austerity of rejection, which would be  the merest affectation on our part. Upon these principles, and taking  somewhat of a middle course, I shall here note a few types of foliage  which I think may be useful to you in the work upon which you are  engaged.    Leaf forms, with their appropriate flowers or fruit, afford the carver a  very large proportion of his subject material. They serve him as  principal subject, as bordering or background to figures of men or  animals; they occur as mere detached spots, to break the monotony of  spaces or lines; and in a thousand other ways give exercise to his  invention.    As a general rule, those leaves with serrated, or deeply cleft and  indented edges, lend themselves most readily to decorative treatment.  Large, broad leaves, with unbroken surfaces, and triangular or rounded  outlines, are less manageable. Those most commonly taken as models are:    _The Vine, with its Grapes._--This was freely used by medieval carvers,  at first for its symbolic significance, but afterward even more on  account of its rare beauty of form.

No. 188. HOW TO PREPARE ARROW-ROOT.    Mix a piled-up dessert-spoonful of arrow-root with half a gill of cold  water, and pour this into a small saucepan containing nearly half a pint  of boiling water, four lumps of sugar, and a glass of wine; stir the  arrow-root while it is boiling on the fire for a few minutes, and then  give it to the patient.    Observe that it is essential to perfection in the preparation of  arrow-root, and, indeed, of all farinaceous kinds of food, that the  whole of the ingredients used in the preparation should be boiled  together.      No. 189. HOW TO MAKE GRUEL WITH PEARL BARLEY.    Put four ounces of pearl barley in a saucepan with two quarts of cold  water and a small stick of cinnamon, and set the whole to boil very  gently by the side of the fire (partly covered with the lid) for two  hours; then add the sugar and the wine, boil all together a few minutes  longer, and then strain the gruel through a colander into a jug, to be  kept in a cool place until required for use; when it can be warmed up in  small quantities.    As this kind of gruel is a powerful cordial, it is to be borne in mind  that it should never be administered unless ordered by a medical man.      No. 190. COW-HEEL BROTH.    Put a cow-heel into a saucepan with three quarts of water, and set it to  boil on the fire; skim it well, season with a few peppercorns, a sprig  of thyme and parsley, and a dessert-spoonful of salt; boil gently for  two hours; at the end of this time the broth will be reduced to half its  original quantity; skim off all the grease, and serve the broth with the  glutinous part of the heel in it. This kind of broth is both  strengthening and healing to the stomach.      No. 191. HOW TO MAKE CALF'S-FEET JELLY.    Boil two calf's feet in two quarts of water very gently for at least two  hours; at the end of this time the liquid will be boiled down to one  half of its original quantity; it is then to be strained into a pan,  and left to cool till the next day. Scrape and wash off all grease, dab  a clean cloth all over the surface to absorb any remaining grease, put  the calf's-foot stock or broth into a very clean saucepan, add three  ounces of lump sugar, a bit of lemon-peel, the juice of a lemon, a  little bruised cinnamon, and half a pint of white wine; boil all  together for ten minutes, skim, strain through a doubled piece of muslin  into a basin; set the jelly in a very cold place to cool and become  firm.      No. 192. HOW TO MAKE ICELAND-MOSS JELLY.    Iceland moss is to be had of all chemists. Put four ounces of Iceland  moss to boil in one quart of water, stirring it the whole time it is on  the fire; and when it has boiled about three-quarters of an hour, add  two ounces of lump sugar and a glass of white wine; strain the jelly  through a piece of muslin into a basin, and when it is set firm and  cold, let it be given to the patient. This kind of jelly is most  beneficial in cases of severe colds, catarrhs, and all pulmonary  diseases of the lungs and chest.      No. 193. HOW TO MAKE BLANCMANGE.    Scald, skin, wash, and thoroughly bruise one ounce of sweet almonds with  a rolling-pin on a table; put this into a basin with one ounce of lump  sugar, and three gills of cold water, and allow the whole to stand and  steep for three hours. Next, boil one ounce of shred isinglass, or  gelatine, in a gill of water, by stirring it on the fire, while boiling,  for ten minutes; pour this to the milk of almonds; strain all through a  muslin into a basin, and when the blancmange has become stiff and cold,  let it be given to the patient in cases of fevers, or extreme delicacy.      No. 194. HOW TO MAKE SICK-DIET JELLY.    Take of sago, tapioca, eringo root, and hartshorn shavings, of each one  ounce; and boil the whole in three pints of water until reduced to one  pint, stirring all the time; then strain the jelly through a muslin into  a basin, and set it aside to become cold. A table-spoonful of this jelly  may be given at a time, mixed in broth, milk, chocolate, cocoa, or tea.  It is considered to be very strengthening.      No. 195. HOW TO PREPARE ISINGLASS JELLY.    Put one ounce and a-half of isinglass, with two ounces of lump sugar and  half a pint of water, into a small stewpan, and stir the whole on the  fire while it boils gently for ten minutes; then remove the jelly from  the fire, add the juice of three oranges, and the thin pared rind of one  orange; stir well together for five minutes, strain through a muslin  into a basin, and set the jelly in a cold place to become stiff.      No. 196. HOW TO MAKE GROUND-RICE MILK.    Put a pint of milk with a bit of cinnamon to boil, mix a large  table-spoonful of ground rice quite smooth with a tea-cupful of milk,  pour this into the boiling milk, stirring quickly all the time in order  to render it smooth; add sugar to sweeten, and stir the ground-rice milk  on the fire while boiling for ten minutes. Remember, that whenever you  are stirring any kind of sauce, gruel, porridge, or thick milk, etc., on  the fire, it is most essential that you should bear with some weight on  the edge of the bowl of the spoon to prevent whatever is being stirred  from burning at the bottom of the saucepan, as such an accident would  infallibly spoil the gruel, etc.      No. 197. HOW TO MAKE A SMALL BATTER-PUDDING.    Beat up in a basin an egg with a large table-spoonful of flour, and a  grain of salt; add, by degrees, a tea-cupful of milk, working all  together vigorously; pour this batter into a ready greased inside of a  tea-cup, just large enough to hold it; sprinkle a little flour on the  top, place a small square clean rag on it, and then, with the spread-out  fingers of the right hand, catch up both cloth and tea-cup, holding them  up in order to enable you to gather up the ends of the rag tight in your  left hand, while with a piece of string held in the right hand, you tie  up the pudding securely, and put it on to boil, in boiling water, for a  good half-hour; at the end of this time the pudding will be done, and  should be eaten immediately with sugar, and a few drops of wine, if  allowed and procurable.      No. 198. HOW TO MAKE A TEA-CUP BREAD-PUDDING.    Bruise a piece of stale crumb of bread the size of an egg, in a basin,  add four lumps of sugar and a very little grated nutmeg, pour half a  gill of boiling milk upon these, stir all well together until the sugar  is melted, then add an egg, beat up the whole thoroughly until well  mixed; pour the mixture into a buttered tea-cup, tie it up in a small  cloth as directed in the preceding Number, boil the pudding for twenty  minutes, at least, and, as soon as done, turn it out on a plate. This,  or any similar light kind of pudding, constitutes safe food for the most  delicate.      No. 199. HOW TO MAKE A TAPIOCA PUDDING.    Put two table-spoonfuls of tapioca into a basin with four lumps of  sugar, a grain of salt, and a lump of sugar rubbed on the rind of a  lemon; pour a gill of boiling milk over these ingredients and cover them  up with a saucer to steep for ten minutes, then add one egg; beat up all  together, and boil the pudding in a buttered tea-cup tied up in a  cloth, for nearly half an hour.      No. 200. HOW TO MAKE AN ARROW-ROOT PUDDING.    Mix a large dessert-spoonful of arrow-root with the same quantity of  bruised sugar, and a tea-cupful of milk, in a small clean saucepan; stir  this on the fire until it boils, and keep on stirring it, off the fire,  for five minutes, until the heat has subsided; then add an egg, beat up  and thoroughly mix it into the batter, and then boil the pudding as  shown in the preceding Numbers.      No. 201. HOW TO MAKE A SAGO PUDDING.    Soak two table-spoonfuls of pearl sago with a tea-spoonful of hot milk,  in a covered basin, for a quarter of an hour; then add a very little  grated nutmeg or lemon-peel, sugar to sweeten, and an egg; beat up all  together until thoroughly mixed, and then boil the pudding in a buttered  basin or tea-cup, as directed in preceding cases.      No. 202. HOW TO MAKE A GROUND-RICE PUDDING.    Mix a large table-spoonful of ground rice with half a pint of milk, six  lumps of sugar, and a very little nutmeg; stir this in a saucepan on the  fire until it has boiled for five minutes; then mix in an egg, and boil  the pudding for twenty-five minutes.      No. 203. BROWN AND POLSON TEA-CUP PUDDING FOR INFANTS.    Mix a good dessert-spoonful of Brown and Polson's corn-flour with half a  pint of milk, six lumps of sugar, a grain of salt, and a very little  grated orange-peel; stir these on the fire to boil for five minutes,  then add one egg, beat up until well mixed; pour this batter into a  buttered tea-cup, tie it up in a small cloth, boil it for twenty-five  minutes, and serve it while hot.
