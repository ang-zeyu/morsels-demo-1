They shrink back: they even resist.  So the captain orders a 'prentice  boy to jump in and set them the example.  He is a fine, handsome boy,  with curly brown hair and bright black eyes.  He, too, hesitates for a  moment, but from a far different motive.  If left to himself he would  emulate the captain in being that proverbial \"last man to quit the  wreck,\" but a peremptory order is given, and, with a blush, he jumps  into the bag, or breeches, of the buoy, through which his legs project  in a somewhat ridiculous manner.  A signal is then made to the shore.  The coastguardsmen haul on the whip, and off goes our 'prentice boy like  a seagull.  His flight is pretty rapid, considering all things.  When  about half-way to land he is seen dimly in the mist of spray that bursts  wildly around and over him.  Those on the wreck strain their eyes and  watch with palpitating hearts.  The ship has been rolling a little.  Just then it gives a heavy lurch shoreward, the rope slackens, and down  goes our 'prentice boy into the raging sea, which seems to roar louder  as if in triumph!  It is but for a moment, however.  The double-block  tackle, already mentioned as being attached to the shore-end of the  hawser, is manned by strong active fellows, whose duty it is to ease off  the rope when the wreck rolls seaward, and haul it in when she rolls  shoreward, thus keeping it always pretty taut without the risk of  snapping it.    A moment more and the 'prentice is seen to emerge from the surf like a  true son of Neptune; he is seen also, like a true son of Britain, to  wave one hand above his head, and faintly, through driving surf and  howling gale, comes a cheer.  It is still more faintly replied to by  those on the wreck, for in his progress the boy is hidden for a few  seconds by the leaping spray; but in a few seconds more he is seen  struggling among the breakers on the beach.  Several strong men are seen  to join hands and advance to meet him.  Another moment, and he is safe  on shore, and a fervent \"Thank God!\" bursts from the wrecked crew, who  seem to forget themselves for a moment as they observe the waving  handkerchiefs and hats which tell that a hearty cheer has greeted the  rescued sailor boy.    There is little tendency now to hesitation on the part of the women, and  what remains is put to flight by certain ominous groans and creakings,  that tell of the approaching dissolution of the ship.    One after another they are lifted tenderly into the lifebuoy, and drawn  to land in safety, amid the congratulations and thanksgivings of many of  those who have assembled to witness their deliverance.  It is truly  terrible work, this dragging of tender women through surf and thundering  waves; but it is a matter of life or death, and even the most delicate  of human beings become regardless of small matters in such  circumstances.    But the crew have yet to be saved, and there are still two women on  board--one of them with a baby!  The mother--a thin, delicate woman--  positively refuses to go without her babe.  The captain knows full well  that, if he lets her take it, the child will be torn from her grasp to a  certainty; he therefore adopts a seemingly harsh, but really merciful,  course.  He assists her into the buoy, takes a quick turn of a rope  round her to keep her in, snatches the child from her arms, and gives  the signal to haul away.  With a terrible cry the mother holds out her  arms as she is dragged from the bulwarks, then struggles to leap out,  but in vain.  Another wild shriek, with the arms tossed upwards, and she  falls back as if in a fit.    \"Poor thing!\" mutters the captain, as he gazes pitifully at the  retreating figure; \"but you'll soon be happy again.  Come, Dick, get  ready to go wi' the child next trip.\"    Dick Shales is a huge hairy seaman, with the frame of an elephant, the  skin of a walrus, and the tender heart of a woman!  He glances uneasily  round.    \"There's another lady yet, sir.\"    \"You obey orders,\" says the captain, sternly.    \"I never disobeyed orders yet, sir, and I won't do it now,\" says Dick,  taking the baby into his strong arms and buttoning it up tenderly in his  capacious bosom.    As he speaks, the lifebuoy arrives again with a jovial sort of swing, as  if it had been actually warmed into life by its glorious work, and had  come out of its own accord.    \"Now, then, lads; hold on steady!\" says Dick, getting in, \"for fear you  hurt the babby.  This is the first time that Dick Shales has appeared on  any stage wotsomediver in the character of a woman!\"    Dick smiles in a deprecating manner at his little joke as they haul him  off the wreck.  But Dick is wrong, and his mates feel this as they cheer  him, for many a time before that had he appeared in woman's character  when woman's work had to be done.    The captain was right when he muttered that the mother would be \"soon  happy again.\"  When Dick placed the baby--wet, indeed, but well--in its  mother's arms, she knew a kind of joy to which she had been a stranger  before--akin to that joy which must have swelled the grateful heart of  the widow of Nain when she received her son back from the dead.    The rest of the work is soon completed.  After the last woman is drawn  ashore the crew are quickly rescued--the captain, of course, like every  true captain, last of all.  Thus the battle is waged and won, and  nothing is left but a shattered wreck for wind and waves to do their  worst upon.    The rescued ones are hurried off to the nearest inn, where sympathetic  Christian hearts and hands minister to their necessities.  These are  directed by the local agent for that admirable institution, the  Shipwrecked Fishermen's and Mariners' Society--a society which cannot be  too highly commended, and which, it is well to add, is supported by  voluntary subscriptions.    Meanwhile the gallant men of the coastguard, rejoicing in the feeling  that they have done their duty so well and so successfully, though wet  and weary from long exposure and exertion, pack the rocket apparatus  into its cart, run it back to its place of shelter, to be there made  ready for the next call to action, and then saunter home, perchance to  tell their wives and little ones the story of the wreck and rescue,  before lying down to take much-needed and well-earned repose.    Let me say in conclusion that hundreds of lives are saved in this manner  _every_ year.  It is well that the reader should bear in remembrance  what I stated at the outset, that the Great War is unceasing.  Year by  year it is waged.  There is no prolonged period of rest.  There is no  time when we should forget this great work; but there are times when we  should call it specially to remembrance, and bear it upon our hearts  before Him whom the wind and sea obey.    When the wild storms of winter and spring are howling; when the frost is  keen and the gales are laden with snowdrift; when the nights are dark  and long, and the days are short and grey--then it is that our prayers  should ascend and our hands be opened, for then it is that hundreds of  human beings are in deadly peril on our shores, and then it is that our  gallant lifeboat and rocket-men are risking life and limb while fighting  their furious Battles with the Sea.    THE END."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#14)"],[1,"being larger, and the mould much  richer than in the Valley of the Wreck, it was clothed with a more  luxuriant growth of trees and plants.  Some trees were dark, glossy  green; others of a rich and warm hue, contrasting well with those of a  pale, light green, which were everywhere abundant.  Among these we  recognised the broad, dark heads of the bread-fruit, with its golden  fruit; the pure, silvery foliage of the candle-nut, and several species  which bore a strong resemblance to the pine; while here and there, in  groups and in single trees, rose the tall forms of the cocoa-nut palms,  spreading abroad, and waving their graceful plumes high above all the  rest, as if they were a superior race of stately giants keeping guard  over these luxuriant forests.  Oh, it was a most enchanting scene! and I  thanked God for having created such delightful spots for the use of man.    Now, while we were gazing around us in silent admiration, Jack uttered  an exclamation of surprise, and pointing to an object a little to one  side of us, said:    \"That's a banyan tree.\"    \"And what's a banyan tree?\" inquired Peterkin as we walked towards it.    \"A very curious one, as you shall see presently,\" replied Jack.  \"It is  called the _aoa_ here, if I recollect rightly, and has a wonderful  peculiarity about it.  What an enormous one it is, to be sure!\"    \"_It_!\" repeated Peterkin.  \"Why, there are dozens of banyans here!  What do you mean by talking bad grammar?  Is your philosophy deserting  you, Jack?\"    \"There is but one tree here of this kind,\" returned Jack, \"as you will  perceive if you will examine it.\"  And, sure enough, we did find that  what we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one.  Its  bark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the leaves  being lance-shaped, small, and of a beautiful pea-green.  But the  wonderful thing about it was that the branches, which grew out from the  stem horizontally, sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground, which,  taking root, had themselves become trees, and were covered with bark  like the tree itself.  Many of these fibres had descended from the  branches at various distances, and thus supported them on natural  pillars, some of which were so large and strong that it was not easy at  first to distinguish the offspring from the parent stem.  The fibres  were of all sizes and in all states of advancement, from the pillars we  have just mentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to  take root, and thin brown threads still far from the ground, which  swayed about with every motion of wind.  In short, it seemed to us that,  if there were only space afforded to it, this single tree would at  length cover the whole island.    Shortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree, which, as its  peculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful to us, merits  description.  It was a splendid chestnut, but its proper name Jack did  not know.  However, there were quantities of fine nuts upon it, some of  which we put in our pockets.  But its stem was the most wonderful part  of it.  It rose to about twelve feet without a branch, and was not of  great thickness; on the contrary, it was remarkably slender for the size  of the tree.  But to make up for this, there were four or five wonderful  projections in this stem, which I cannot better describe than by asking  the reader to suppose that five planks of two inches thick and three  feet broad had been placed round the trunk of the tree, with their  _edges_ closely fixed to it, from the ground up to the branches, and  that these planks had been covered over with the bark of the tree and  incorporated with it.  In short, they were just natural buttresses,  without which the stem could not have supported its heavy and umbrageous  top.  We found these chestnuts to be very numerous.  They grew chiefly  on the banks of the stream, and were of all sizes.    While we were examining a small tree of this kind Jack chipped a piece  off a buttress with his axe, and found the wood to be firm and easily  cut.  He then struck the axe into it with all his force, and very soon  split it off close to the tree--first, however, having cut it across  transversely above and below.  By this means he satisfied himself that  we could now obtain short planks, as it were all ready sawn, of any size  and thickness that we desired, which was a very great discovery indeed--  perhaps the most important we had yet made.    We now wended our way back to the coast, intending to encamp near the  beach, as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome in the forest.  On our way we could not help admiring the birds which flew and chirped  around us.  Among them we observed a pretty kind of paroquet, with a  green body, a blue head, and a red breast; also a few beautiful  turtle-doves, and several flocks of wood-pigeons.  The hues of many of  these birds were extremely vivid--bright green, blue, and scarlet being  the prevailing tints.  We made several attempts throughout the day to  bring down one of these, both with the bow and the sling--not for mere  sport, but to ascertain whether they were good for food.  But we  invariably missed, although once or twice we were very near hitting.  As  evening drew on however, a flock of pigeons flew past.  I slung a stone  into the midst of them at a venture, and had the good fortune to kill  one.  We were startled soon after by a loud whistling noise above our  heads, and on looking up, saw a flock of wild ducks making for the  coast.  We watched these, and observing where they alighted, followed  them up until we came upon a most lovely blue lake, not more than two  hundred yards long, embosomed in verdant trees.  Its placid surface,  which reflected every leaf and stem as if in a mirror, was covered with  various species of wild ducks, feeding among the sedges and broad-leaved  water-plants which floated on it, while numerous birds like water-hens  ran to and fro most busily on its margin.  These all, with one accord,  flew tumultuously away the instant we made our appearance.  While  walking along the margin we observed fish in the water, but of what sort  we could not tell.    Now, as we neared the shore, Jack and I said we would go a little out of  our way to see if we could procure one of those ducks; so, directing  Peterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire, we separated,  promising to rejoin him speedily.  But we did not find the ducks,  although we made a diligent search for half-an-hour.  We were about to  retrace our steps when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights  that we had yet beheld.    Just in front of us, at the distance of about ten yards, grew a superb  tree, which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on the island.  Its trunk was at least five feet in diameter, with a smooth, grey bark;  above this the spreading branches were clothed with light-green leaves,  amid which were clusters of bright-yellow fruit, so numerous as to weigh  down the boughs with their great weight.  This fruit seemed to be of the  plum species, of an oblong form, and a good deal larger than the magnum  bonum plum.  The ground at the foot of this tree was thickly strewn with  the fallen fruit, in the midst of which lay sleeping, in every possible  attitude, at least twenty hogs of all ages and sizes, apparently quite  surfeited with a recent banquet.    Jack and I could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at these  coarse, fat, ill-looking animals while they lay groaning and snoring  heavily amid the remains of their supper.    \"Now, Ralph,\" said Jack in a low whisper, \"put a stone in your sling--a  good big one--and let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you.  I'll try to put an arrow into yon little pig.\"    \"Don't you think we had better put them up first?\"  I whispered.  \"It  seems cruel to kill them while asleep.\"    \"If I wanted _sport_, Ralph, I would certainly set them up; but as we  only want _pork_, we'll let them lie.  Besides, we're not sure of  killing them; so, fire away.\"    Thus admonished, I slung my stone with so good aim that it went bang  against the hog's flank as if against the head of a drum; but it had no  other effect than that of causing the animal to start to its feet, with  a frightful yell of surprise, and scamper away.  At the same instant  Jack's bow twanged, and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by  the ear.    \"I've missed, after all!\" cried Jack, darting forward with uplifted axe;  while the little pig uttered a loud squeal, tore the arrow from the  ground, and ran away with it, along with the whole drove, into the  bushes and disappeared, though we heard them screaming long afterwards  in the distance.    \"That's very provoking, now,\" said Jack, rubbing the point of his nose.    \"Very,\" I replied, stroking my chin.    \"Well, we must make haste and rejoin Peterkin,\" said Jack; \"it's getting  late.\"  And without further remark, we threaded our way quickly through  the woods towards the shore.    When we reached it we found wood laid out, the fire lighted and  beginning to kindle up, with other signs of preparation for our  encampment; but Peterkin was nowhere to be found.  We wondered very much  at this; but Jack suggested that he might have gone to fetch water, so  he gave a shout to let him know that we had arrived, and sat down upon a  rock, while I threw off my jacket and seized the axe, intending to split  up one or two billets of wood.  But I had scarce moved from the spot  when, in the distance, we heard a most appalling shriek, which was  followed up by a chorus of yells from the hogs, and a loud hurrah.    \"I do believe,\" said I, \"that Peterkin has met with the hogs.\"    \"When Greek meets Greek,\" said Jack, soliloquising, \"then comes the tug  of--\"    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Peterkin in the distance.    We turned hastily towards the direction whence the sound came, and soon  descried"]]]
