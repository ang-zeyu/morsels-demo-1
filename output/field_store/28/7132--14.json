He still looked about him, and at me; but all this while he  had never spoken a word. At length, I asked if he would take any  refreshment? 'If you please,'  said he. I asked what he would have, but  he only answered, 'Whatever you choose, madam.' If he was taken with my  address, I was much more taken with his; for he was a complete  gentleman, and a gentleman will ever act as one. At length, he began as  follows:    \"'I am utterly at a loss to account for this adventure, madam. It seems  to me like enchantment, and I can hardly believe my senses. An English  lady, I judge, and one, who from her manner and address should belong  to the first class of society, in such a place as this, is indeed  matter of wonder to me. At the foot of a close in Edinburgh! and at  this time of the night! Surely it must have been no common reverse of  fortune that reduced you to this?' I wept, or pretended to do so; on  which he added, 'Pray, madam, take heart. Tell me what has befallen  you; and if I can do anything for you, in restoring you to your country  or your friends, you shall command my interest.'    \"I had great need of a friend then, and I thought now was the time to  secure one. So I began and told him the moving tale I have told you.  But I soon perceived that I had kept by the naked truth too  unvarnishedly, and thereby quite overshot my mark. When he learned that  he was sitting in a wretched corner of an irregular house, with a  felon, who had so lately been scourged and banished as a swindler and  impostor, his modest nature took the alarm, and he was shocked, instead  of being moved with pity. His eye fixed on some of the casual stripes  on my arm, and from that moment he became restless and impatient to be  gone. I tried some gentle arts to retain him, but in vain; so, after  paying both the landlady and me for pleasures he had neither tasted nor  asked, he took his leave.    \"I showed him downstairs; and, just as he turned the corner of the next  land, a man came rushing violently by him; exchanged looks with him,  and came running up to me. He appeared in great agitation, and was  quite out of breath; and, taking my hand in his, we ran upstairs  together without speaking, and were instantly in the apartment I had  left, where a stoup of wine still stood untasted. 'Ah, this is  fortunate!' said my new spark, and helped himself. In the meanwhile, as  our apartment was a corner one, and looked both east and north, I ran  to the eastern casement to look after Drummond. Now, note me well: I  saw him going eastward in his tartans and bonnet, and the gilded hilt  of his claymore glittering in the moon; and, at the very same time, I  saw two men, the one in black, and the other likewise in tartans,  coming towards the steps from the opposite bank, by the foot of the  loch; and I saw Drummond and they eyeing each other as they passed. I  kept view of him till he vanished towards Leith Wynd, and by that time  the two strangers had come close up under our window. This is what I  wish you to pay particular attention to. I had only lost sight of  Drummond (who had given me his name and address) for the short space of  time that we took in running up one pair of short stairs; and during  that space he had halted a moment, for, when I got my eye on him again,  he had not crossed the mouth of the next entry, nor proceeded above ten  or twelve paces, and, at the same time, I saw the two men coming down  the bank on the opposite side of the loch, at about three hundred  paces' distance. Both he and they were distinctly in my view, and never  within speech of each other, until he vanished into one of the wynds  leading towards the bottom of the High Street, at which precise time  the two strangers came below my window; so that it was quite dear he  neither could be one of them nor have any communication with them.    \"Yet, mark me again; for, of all things I have ever seen, this was the  most singular. When I looked down at the two strangers, one of them was  extremely like Drummond. So like was he that there was not one item in  dress, form, feature, nor voice, by which I could distinguish the one  from the other. I was certain it was not he, because I had seen the one  going and the other approaching at the same time, and my impression at  the moment was that I looked upon some spirit, or demon, in his  likeness. I felt a chillness creep all round my heart, my knees  tottered, and, withdrawing my head from the open casement that lay in  the dark shade, I said to the man who was with me, 'Good God, what is  this?'    \"'What is it, my dear?' said he, as much alarmed as I was.    \"'As I live, there stands an apparition!' said I.    \"He was not so much afraid when he heard me say so, and, peeping  cautiously out, he looked and listened awhile, and then, drawing back,  he said in a whisper, 'They are both living men, and one of them is he  I passed at the corner.'    \"'That he is not,' said I, emphatically. 'To that I will make oath.'    \"He smiled and shook his head, and then added, 'I never then saw a man  before, whom I could not know again, particularly if he was the very  last I had seen. But what matters it whether it be or not? As it is no  concern of ours, let us sit down and enjoy ourselves.'    'But it does matter a very great deal with me, sir,' said I. 'Bless me,  my head is giddy--my breath quite gone, and I feel as if I were  surrounded with fiends. Who are you, sir?'    'You shall know that ere we two part, my love,'  said he. 'I cannot  conceive why the return of this young gentleman to the spot he so  lately left should discompose you. I suppose he got a glance of you as  he passed, and has returned to look after you, and that is the whole  secret of the matter.'    \"'If you will be so civil as to walk out and join him then, it will  oblige me hugely,' said I, 'for I never in my life experienced such  boding apprehensions of evil company. I cannot conceive how you should  come up here without asking my permission. Will it please you to be  gone, sir?' I was within an ace of prevailing. He took out his purse--I  need not say more--I was bribed to let him remain. Ah, had I kept my  frail resolution of dismissing him at that moment, what a world of  shame and misery had been evited! But that, though uppermost still in  my mind, has nothing ado here.    \"When I peeped over again, the two men were disputing in a whisper, the  one of them in violent agitation and terror, and the other upbraiding  him, and urging him on to some desperate act. At length I heard the  young man in the Highland garb say indignantly, 'Hush, recreant! It is  God's work which you are commissioned to execute, and it must be done.  But, if you positively decline it, I will do it myself, and do you  beware of the consequences.'    \"'Oh, I will, I will!' cried the other in black clothes, in a wretched  beseeching tone. 'You shall instruct me in this, as in all things else.'    \"I thought all this while I was closely concealed from them, and  wondered not a little when he in tartans gave me a sly nod, as much as  to say, 'What do you think of this?' or, 'Take note of what you see,'  or something to that effect; from which I perceived that, whatever he  was about, he did not wish it to be kept a secret. For all that, I was  impressed with a terror and anxiety that I could not overcome, but it  only made me mark every event with the more intense curiosity. The  Highlander, whom I still could not help regarding as the evil genius of  Thomas Drummond, performed every action as with the quickness of  thought. He concealed the youth in black in a narrow entry, a little to  the westward of my windows, and, as he was leading him across the  moonlight green by the shoulder, I perceived, for the first time, that  both of them were armed with rapiers. He pushed him without resistance  into the dark shaded close, made another signal to me, and hasted up  the close to Lucky Sudds' door. The city and the morning were so still  that I heard every word that was uttered, on putting my head out a  little. He knocked at the door sharply, and, after waiting a  considerable space, the bolt was drawn, and the door, as I conceived,  edged up as far as the massy chain would let it. 'Is young Dalcastle  still in the house?' said he sharply.    \"I did not hear the answer, but I heard him say, shortly after, 'If he  is, pray tell him to speak with me for a few minutes.' He then withdrew  from the door, and came slowly down the close, in a lingering manner,  looking oft behind him. Dalcastle came out; advanced a few steps after  him, and then stood still, as if hesitating whether or not he should  call out a friend to accompany him; and that instant the door behind  him was closed, chained, and the iron bolt drawn; on hearing of which,  he followed his adversary without further hesitation. As he passed  below my window, I heard him say, 'I beseech you, Tom, let us do  nothing in this matter rashly'; but I could not hear the answer of the  other, who had turned the corner.    \"I roused up my drowsy companion, who was leaning on the bed, and we  both looked together from the north window. We were in the shade, but  the moon shone full on the two young gentlemen. Young Dalcastle was  visibly the worse of liquor, and, his back being turned towards us, he  said something to the other which I could not make out, although he  spoke a considerable time, and, from his tones and gestures, appeared  to be reasoning.    \"When he had done, the tall young man in the tartans drew his sword,  and, his face being straight to us, we heard him say distinctly, 'No  more words about it, George, if you please; but if you be a man, as I  take you to be, draw your sword, and let us settle it here.'    \"Dalcastle drew his sword, without changing his attitude; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#14)"],[1,"B') with one terminal of the transmitter, and the other  terminal of the transmitter has a wire (C, C') which goes to the  receiver. From the other terminal of the receiver is a wire (D, D')  which leads to the upper stop contact (E, E') of the telephone hook. A  wire (F, F') from the lower stop contact (G, G') of the hook goes to one  terminal of the bell, and from the other terminal of the bell is a wire  (H, H') which makes connection with the line wire (A). In order to make  a complete circuit between the two stations, a line wire (I) is run from  the pivot of the hook in station 1 to the pivot of the hook in station  2.    In the diagram, it is assumed that the receivers are on the hooks, and  that both hooks are, therefore, in circuit with the lower contacts (G,  G'), so that the transmitter and receiver are both out of circuit with  the batteries, and the bell in circuit; but the moment the receiver, for  instance, in station 1 is taken off the hook, the latter springs up so  that it contacts with the stop (E), thus establishing a circuit through  the line wire (I) to the hook of station 2, and from the hook through  line (F') to the bell. From the bell, the line (A) carries the current  back to the battery of station (A), thence through the wire (B) to the  transmitter wire (C) to receiver and wire (D) to the post (E), thereby  completing the circuit.    When, at station 2, the receiver is taken off the hook, and the latter  contacts with the post (E'), the transmitter and receiver of both  stations are in circuit with each other, but both bells are cut out.          CHAPTER XIII    ELECTROLYSIS, WATER PURIFICATION, ELECTROPLATING      DECOMPOSING LIQUIDS.--During the earlier experiments in the field of  electricity, after the battery or cell was discovered, it was noted that  when a current was formed in the cell, the electrolyte was charged and  gases evolved from it. A similar action takes place when a current of  electricity passes through a liquid, with the result that the liquid is  decomposed--that is, the liquid is broken up into its original  compounds. Thus, water is composed of two parts, by bulk, of hydrogen  and of oxygen, so that if two electrodes are placed in water, and a  current is sent through the electrodes in either direction, all the  water will finally disappear in the form of hydrogen and oxygen gases.    MAKING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN.--During this electrical action, the hydrogen  is set free at the negative pole and the oxygen at the positive pole. A  simple apparatus, which any boy can make, to generate pure oxygen and  pure hydrogen, is shown in Fig. 89.    It is constructed of a glass or earthen jar (A), preferably square, to  which is fitted a wooden top (B), this top being provided with a  packing ring (C), so as to make it air-tight. Within is a vertical  partition (D), the edges of which, below the cap, fit tightly against  the inner walls of the jar. This partition extends down into the jar a  sufficient distance so it will terminate below the water level. A pipe  is fitted through the top on each side of the partition, and each pipe  has a valve. An electrode, of any convenient metal, is secured at its  upper end to the top of the cap, on each side of the partition. These  electrodes extend down to the bottom of the jar, and an electric wire  connects with each of them at the top.    [Illustration: _Fig. 89._ DEVICE FOR MAKING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN]    If a current of electricity is passed through the wires and the  electrodes, in the direction shown by the darts, hydrogen will form at  the negative pole, and oxygen at the positive pole. These gases will  escape upwardly, so that they will be trapped in their respective  compartments, and may be drawn off by means of the pipes.    PURIFYING WATER.--Advantage is taken of this electrolytic action, to  purify water. Oxygen is the most wonderful chemical in nature. It is  called the acid-maker of the universe. The name is derived from two  words, _oxy_ and _gen_; one denoting oxydation, and the other that it  generates. In other words, it is the _generator of oxides_. It is the  element which, when united with any other element, produces an acid, an  alkali or a neutral compound.    RUST.--For instance, iron is largely composed of ferric acid. When  oxygen, in a free or gaseous state, comes into contact with iron, it  produces ferrous oxide, which is recognized as rust.    OXYGEN AS A PURIFIER.--But oxygen is also a purifier. All low forms of  animal life, like bacteria or germs in water, succumb to free oxygen. By  _free oxygen_ is meant oxygen in the form of gas.    COMPOSITION OF WATER.--Now, water, in which harmful germs live, is  one-third oxygen. Nevertheless, the germs thrive in water, because the  oxygen is in a compound state, and, therefore, not an active agent. But  if oxygen, in the form of gas, can be forced through water, it will  attack the germs, and destroy them.    COMMON AIR NOT A GOOD PURIFIER.--Water may be purified, to a certain  extent, by forcing common air through it, and the foulest water, if run  over rocks, will be purified, in a measure, because air is intermingled  with it. But common air is composed of four-fifths nitrogen, and only  one-fifth oxygen, and, as nitrogen is the staple article of food for  bacteria, the purifying method by air is not effectual.    PURE OXYGEN.--When, however, oxygen is generated from water, by means of  electrolysis, it is pure; hence is more active and is not tainted by a  life-giving substance for germs, such as nitrogen.    The mechanism usually employed for purifying water is shown in Fig. 90.    A WATER PURIFIER.--The case (A, Fig. 90) may be made of metal or of an  insulating material. If made of metal it must be insulated within with  slate, glass, marble or hard rubber, as shown at B. The case is provided  with exterior flanges (C, D), with upper and lower ends, and it is  mounted upon a base plate (E) and affixed thereto by bolts. The upper  end has a conically-formed cap (F) bolted to the flanges (C), and this  has an outlet to which a pipe (G) is attached. The water inlet pipe (H)  passes through the lower end of the case (A). The electrodes (I, J) are  secured, vertically, within the case, separated from each other  equidistant, each alternate electrode being connected up with one wire  (K), and the alternate electrodes with a wire (L).    [Illustration: _Fig. 90._ ELECTRIC WATER PURIFIER]    When the water passes upwardly, the decomposed or gaseous oxygen  percolates through the water and thus attacks the germs and destroys  them.    THE USE OF HYDROGEN IN PURIFICATION.--On the other hand, the hydrogen  also plays an important part in purifying the water. This depends upon  the material of which the electrodes are made. Aluminum is by far the  best material, as it is one of nature's most active purifiers. All clay  contains aluminum, in what is known as the sulphate form, and water  passing through the clay of the earth thereby becomes purified, because  of this element.    ALUMINUM ELECTRODES.--When this material is used as the electrodes in  water, hydrate of aluminum is formed, or a compound of hydrogen and  oxygen with aluminum. The product of decomposition is a flocculent  matter which moves upwardly through the water, giving it a milky  appearance. This substance is like gelatine, so that it entangles or  enmeshes the germ life and prevents it from passing through a filter.    If no filter is used, this flocculent matter, as soon as it has given  off the gases, will settle to the bottom and carry with it all  decomposed matter, such as germs and other organic matter attacked by  the oxygen, which has become entangled in the aluminum hydrate.    ELECTRIC HAND PURIFIER.--An interesting and serviceable little purifier  may be made by any boy with the simplest tools, by cutting out three  pieces of sheet aluminum. Hard rolled is best for the purpose. It is  better to have one of the sheets (A), the middle one, thicker than the  two outer plates (B).    [Illustration: _Fig. 91._ PORTABLE ELECTRIC PURIFIER]    Let each sheet be 1-1/2 inches wide and 5-1/2 inches thick. One-half  inch from the upper ends of the two outside plates (B, B) bore bolt  holes (C), each of these holes being a quarter of an inch from the edge  of the plate. The inside plate (A) has two large holes (D) corresponding  with the small holes (C) in the outside plates. At the upper end of this  plate form a wing (E), 1/2 inch wide and 1/2 inch long, provided with a  small hole for a bolt. Next cut out two hard-rubber blocks (F), each  1-1/2 inches long, 1 inch wide and 3/8 inch thick, and then bore a hole  (G) through each, corresponding with the small holes (C) in the plates  (B). The machine is now ready to be assembled. If the inner plate is 1/8  inch thick and the outer plates each 1/16 inch thick, use two small  eighth-inch bolts 1-1/4 inches long, and clamp together the three  plates with these bolts. One of the bolts may be used to attach thereto  one of the electric wires (H), and the other wire (I) is attached by a  bolt to the wing (E).    [Illustration: _Figs. 92-95._ DETAILS OF PORTABLE PURIFIER]    Such a device will answer for a 110-volt circuit, in ordinary water. Now  fill a glass nearly full of water, and stand the purifier in the glass.  Within a few minutes the action of electrolysis will be apparent by the  formation of numerous bubbles on the plates, followed by the  decomposition of the organic matter in the water. At first the  flocculent decomposed matter will rise to the surface of the water, but  before many minutes it will settle to the bottom of the glass and leave  clear water above.    PURIFICATION AND SEPARATION OF METALS.--This electrolytic action is  utilized in metallurgy for the purpose of producing pure metals, but it  is more largely used to separate copper from its base.
