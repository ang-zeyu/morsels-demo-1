Had God turned a new prophet loose in the earth?    The abolition spirit was a part of the general moral and religious  quickening we have mentioned as beginning about 1825, and revealing  itself in revivals, missions, a religious press, and belief in the end  of the world as approaching. The ethical teaching of the great German  philosopher, Emanuel Kant, denouncing all use of man as an instrument,  began to take effect in America through the writings of Coleridge.  Hatred of slavery was gradually intensified and spread. In 1832 rose the  New England Anti-Slavery Society. In 1833 the American Society was  organized, with a platform declaring \"slavery a crime.\"    [1833]      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John G. Whittier in 1833.      This declaration marked one of the most important turning-points in all  the history of the United States. It drew the line. It brought to view  the presence in our land of two sets of earnest thinkers, with  diametrically opposite views touching slavery, who could not permanently  live together under one constitution. May, Phillips, Weld, Whittier, the  Tappans, and many other men of intellect, of oratorical power, and of  wealth, drew to Garrison's side. State abolition societies were  organized all over the North, the Underground Railroad was hard worked  in helping fugitives to Canada, and fiery prophets harangued wherever  they could get a hearing, demanding \"immediate abolition\" in the name of  God.    The Abolitionists proposed none but moral arms in fighting  slavery--papers, pamphlets, public addresses, personal appeals. They  deprecated rebellion by slaves, and urged congressional action against  slavery only in the District of Columbia, in the territories, and at  sea, where the absolute jurisdiction of the general Government was  admitted by nearly all. Nevertheless, southern hostility to them was  indescribably ferocious and uncompromising. They were charged with  instigating all the slave insurrections and insubordination that  occurred, and with having made necessary the new, more diabolical  discipline over blacks, both bond and free. Southern papers and  Legislatures incessantly commanded that Abolitionists be delivered up to  southern justice, their societies and their publications suppressed by  law, and abolitionist agitation made penal. There were northerners quite  ready to grant these demands. Rage against abolitionism, much of it, if  possible, even more unreasoning, prevailed at the North. Garrison says  that he found here \"contempt more bitter, detraction more relentless,  prejudice more stubborn, and apathy more frozen than among slave-owners  themselves.\" The Church, politics, business--all interests save  righteousness--seemed to bow to the false god. Of all utterances against  abolitionism, those of clergymen and religious journals were the  bitterest. To call slavery sin was the unpardonable sin.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Wm. Lloyd Garrison.      [1834-1836]    In 1834, on July 4th, a mob broke up a meeting of the American  Anti-Slavery Society in New York. A few days after, Lewis Tappan's house  was sacked in the same manner, as well as several churches,  school-houses, and dwellings of colored families. At Newark, N. J., a  colored man who had been introduced into a pulpit by the minister of the  congregation, was forcibly wrenched therefrom and carried off to jail.  The pulpit was then torn down and the church gutted. In Norwich, Conn.,  the mob pulled an abolitionist lecturer from his platform and drummed  him out of town to the Rogues' March. In 1836 occurred the murder of  Rev. E. P. Lovejoy, at Alton, Ill. He was the publisher of The Observer,  an abolitionist sheet, which had already been three times suspended by  the destruction of his printing apparatus. It was at a meeting held in  Faneuil Hall over this occurrence that Wendell Phillips first made his  appearance as an anti-slavery orator. Also in 1836 the office at  Cincinnati in which James G. Birney published The Philanthropist, was  sacked, the types scattered, and the press broken and sunk in the river.  Birney was a southerner by birth, and had been a slave-holder, but had  freed his slaves. Between 1834 and 1840 there was hardly a place of any  size in the North where an Abolitionist could speak with certain safety.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Wendell Phillip.      The destruction of colored people's houses became for a time an  every-day occurrence in many northern cities. For some years the  condition of the free blacks and their friends was hardly better north  than south. Schools for colored children were violently opposed even in  New England. One kept by Miss Prudence Crandall, at Canterbury, Conn.,  was, after its opponents had for months sought in every manner to close  it, destroyed by fire. The lady herself was imprisoned, and such schools  were by law forbidden in the State. A colored school at Canaan, N. H.,  was voted a nuisance by a meeting of the town; the building was then  dragged from its foundations and ruined. Many who aided in these deeds  belonged to what were regarded the most respectable classes of society.    [1839-1840]    Owing to the vagaries and unpatriotism of the Garrisonians, there was  from 1840 schism in the abolition ranks. Garrison and his closest  sympathizers were very radical on other questions besides that  concerning the sin of slavery. They declared the Constitution \"a league  with death and a covenant with hell\" because it recognized slavery. They  would neither vote nor hold office under it. They upbraided the churches  as full of the devil's allies. They also advocated community of  property, women's rights, and some of them free love. Others, as Birney,  Whittier, and Gerrit Smith, refused to believe so ill of the  Constitution or of the churches, and wished to rush the slavery question  right into the political arena. The division, far from hindering,  greatly set forward the abolitionist cause. Perhaps neither abolition  society, as such, had, after the schism of 1840, quite the influence  which the old exerted at first, but by this time a very general public  opinion maintained anti-slavery propagandism, pushing it henceforth more  powerfully than ever, as well as, through broader modes of utterance and  action, more successfully. Whittier, Lowell, Longfellow, each enlisted  his muse in the crusade. Wendell Phillips's tongue was a flaming sword.  Clergymen, politicians, and other people entirely conservative in most  things, felt free to join the new society of political Abolitionists.    In 1839 the Governor of Virginia made a requisition on Governor Seward  of New York, to send to Virginia three sailors charged with having aided  a slave out of bondage. Seward declined, on the ground that by New York  law the sailors were guilty of no crime, as that law knew nothing of  property in man. He accompanied his refusal with a discussion of slavery  and slave law quite in the abolitionist vein. To a like call from  Georgia, Seward responded in the same way, and his example was followed  by other northern governors. The Liberty Party took the field in 1840,  Birney and Earle for candidates, who polled nearly 7,000 votes. Four  years later Birney and Morris received 62,300.    It would be a mistake, let us remember, to regard the anti-abolitionist  temper at the North wholly as apathy, friendliness to slavery, or the  result of truckling to the South. Besides sharing the general fanaticism  which mixed itself with the movement, the Abolitionists ignored the  South's dilemma--the ultras totally, the moderates too much. \"What  would you do, brethren, were you in our place?\" asked Dr. Richard  Fuller, of Baltimore, in a national religious meeting where slavery was  under debate; \"how would you go to work to realize your views?\" Dr.  Spencer H. Cone, of New York, roared in reply, \"I would proclaim liberty  throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof.\" But the thing  was far from being so simple as that. Denouncing the Constitution as  Garrison did could not but affront patriotic hearts. It was impolitic,  to say the least, to import English co-agitators, who could not  understand the intricacies of the subject as presented here.      [Illustration: facsimile of Heading of the \"Liberator.\"]      The fact that, defying slave-masters and sycophants alike, the cause of  abolition still went on conquering and to conquer, was due much less to  the strength of its arguments and the energy of its agitation than to  the South's wild outcry and preposterous effrontery of demand.  Conservative northerners began to see that, bad as abolitionism might  be, the means proposed for its suppression were worse still, being  absolutely subversive of personal liberty, free speech, and a free  press. More serious was the conviction, which the South's attitude  nursed, that such mortal horror at Abolitionists and their propaganda  could only be explained by some sort of a conviction on the part of the  South itself that the Abolitionists were right, and that slavery was  precisely the heinous and damnable evil they declared it to be. It was  mostly in considering this aspect of the case that the Church and clergy  more and more developed conscience and voice on freedom's side, as  practical allies of abolitionism. In each great denomination the South  had to break off from the North on account of the latter's love to the  black as a human being. Men felt that an institution unable to stand  discussion ought to fall. By 1850 there were few places at the North  where an Abolitionist might not safely speak his mind.    It were as unjust as it would be painful to view this long, courageous,  desperate defence of slavery as the pure product of depravity.

The roof does not fit properly on  to the walls, and in these latter there are cracks and chinks galore.  Perhaps it is due to these defects that hill houses do not fall down  more often than they do.    Thanks to their numerous cracks they do not offer half the resistance  to a gale of wind that a well-built house would.    Be this as it may, the style of architecture that finds favour in  the hills is quite a godsend to the birds, or rather to such of the  feathered folk as nestle in holes. A house in the Himalayas is, from  an avian point of view, a maze of nesting sites, a hotel in which  unfurnished rooms are always available.    The sparrow usually monopolises these nesting sites. He is a regular  dog-in-the-manger, for he keeps other birds out of the holes he  himself cannot utilise. However, the sparrow is not quite ubiquitous.  In most large hill stations there are more houses than he is able  to monopolise.    I recently spent a couple of days in one of such, in a house situated  some distance from the bazaar, a house surrounded by trees.    Two green-backed tits (_Parus monticola_) were busy preparing a  nursery for their prospective offspring in one of the many holes  presented by the building in question. This had once been a  respectable bungalow, surrounded by a broad verandah. But the day  came when it fell into the hands of a boarding-house keeper, and it  shared the fate of all buildings to which this happens. The verandahs  were enclosed and divided up by partitions, to form, in the words  of the advertisement, \"fine, large, airy rooms.\" There can be no doubt  as to their airiness, but captious persons might dispute their title  to the other epithets. A _kachcha_ verandah had been thrown out with  a galvanised iron roof and wooden supporting pillars. The  subsequently-added roof did not fit properly on to that of the  original verandah, and there was a considerable chink between the  beam that supported it and the wall that enclosed the old verandah,  so that the house afforded endless nesting sites. An inch-wide crack  is quite large enough to admit of the passage of a tit; when this  was negotiated the space between the old and the new roof afforded  endless possibilities. Small wonder, then, that a pair of tits had  elected to nest there.    The green-backed tit is one of the most abundant birds in the Himalayas.  It is about the size of a sparrow. The head is black with a small  perky crest. The cheeks are spotless white. The back of the head is  connected by a narrow black collar with an expansive shirtfront of  this hue. The remainder of the plumage is bright yellow. The back  is greenish yellow, the rest of the plumage is slaty with some dashes  of black and white. Thus the green-backed tit is a smart little bird.  It is as vivacious as it is smart. It constantly utters a sharp, not  unpleasant, metallic dissyllabic call, which sounds like _kiss me_,  _kiss me_, _kiss me_, _kiss me_. This is one of the most familiar  of the tunes that enliven our northern hill stations.    So much for the bird: now for its nest. A nest in a hole possesses  many advantages. Its preparation does not entail very much labour.  It has not to be built; it merely needs furnishing, and this does  not occupy long if the occupiers have Spartan tastes. The tits in  question were luxuriously inclined, if we may judge by the amount  of moss that they carried into that hole. By the time it was finished  it must have been considerably softer than the bed that was provided  for my accommodation!    Moss in plenty was to be had for the taking; the trunks and larger  branches of the trees which surrounded the \"hotel\" were covered with  soft green moss. The tits experienced no difficulty in ripping this  off with the beak.    The entrance to the nest hole faced downwards and was guarded on one  side by the wall of the house, and on the other by a beam, so that  it was not altogether easy of access even to a bird. Consequently  a good deal of the moss gathered by the tits did not reach its  destination; they let it fall while they were negotiating the  entrance.    When a piece of moss dropped from the bird's beak, no attempt was  made to retrieve it, although it only fell some 10 feet on to the  floor of the verandah. In this respect all birds behave alike. They  never attempt to reclaim that which they have let fall. A bird will  spend the greater part of half an hour in wrenching a twig from a  tree: yet, if this is dropped while being carried to the nest, the  bird seems to lose all further interest in it.    By the end of the first day's work at the nest, the pair of tits had  left quite a respectable collection of moss on the floor. This was  swept away next morning. On the second day much less was dropped;  practice had taught the tits how best to enter the nest hole.    It will be noticed that I speak of \"tits.\" I believe I am correct  in so doing; I think that both cock and hen work at the nest. I cannot  say for certain, for I am not able to distinguish a lady- from a  gentleman-tit. I never saw them together at the nest, but I noticed  that the bird bringing material to it sometimes flew direct from a  tree and at others alighted on the projecting end of a roof beam which  the carpenters had been too lazy to saw off. It is my belief that  the bird that used to alight on the beam was not the same as the one  that flew direct from the tree. Birds are creatures of habit. If you  observe a mother bird feeding her young, you will notice that she,  when not disturbed, almost invariably approaches the nest in a certain  fixed manner. She will perch, time after time, on one particular  branch near the nest, and thence fly to her open-mouthed brood. When  both parents bring food to the nest, each approaches in a way peculiar  to itself; the hen will perhaps always come in from the left and the  cock from the right.    The tits in question worked spasmodically at the nest throughout the  hours of daylight. For ten minutes or so they would bring in piece  after piece of moss at a great pace and then indulge in a little  relaxation. All work and no play makes a tit a dull bird.    I had to leave the hotel late on the second day, so was not able to  follow up the fortunes of the two little birds. I have, however, to  thank them for affording me some amusement and giving me pleasant  recollections of the place. It was good to lounge in a long chair,  drink in the cool air, and watch the little birds at work. I shall  soon forget the tumble-down appearance of the house, its seedy  furniture, its coarse durries, and its hard beds, but shall long  remember the great snow-capped peaks in the distance, the green  moss-clad trees near about, the birds that sang in these, the sunbeams  that played among the leaves, and, above all, the two little tits  that worked so industriously at their nest.          _THE PEKIN-ROBIN_      This is not a robin, nor does it seem to be nearly related to the  familiar redbreast; Pekin- or China-robin is merely the name the  dealers give it, because a great many specimens are imported from  China. Its classical name is _Liothrix lutea_. Oates calls it the  red-billed liothrix. It is a bird about the size of a sparrow. The  prevailing hue of the upper plumage is olive green, but the forehead  is yellow. There is also a yellow ring round the eye, and the lower  parts are of varying shades of this colour. Some of the wing feathers  are edged with yellow and some with crimson, so that the wings, when  closed, look as though lines of these colours are pencilled upon them.  Oates, I notice, states that the hen has no red in the wing, but this  does not seem to be the case in all examples. In the Pekin-robins  that hail from China the chief difference between the sexes is that  the plumage of the hen is a little duller than that of the cock. The  bill is bright red. It is thus evident that the _liothrix_ is a  handsome bird, its beauty being of the quiet type which bears close  inspection. But the very great charm of this sprightly little creature  lies, not so much in its colouring, as in its form and movements.  Its perfect proportions give it a very athletic air. In this respect  it resembles the nimble wagtails. Next to these I like the appearance  of the Pekin-robin better than that of any other little bird. Finn  bestows even greater praise upon it, for he says: \"Altogether it is  the most generally attractive small bird I know of--everyone seems  to admire it.\"    There is no bird more full of life. When kept in a cage, Pekin-robins  hop from perch to perch with extraordinary agility, seeming scarcely  to have touched one perch with"]]]
