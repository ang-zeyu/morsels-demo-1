The strength and timbre of the male falsetto  depends partly upon the character of the vocal bands and partly of  course upon the size and shape of the resonance cavities.    Men who have voices of wide range and good volume in the chest or usual  singing voice, generally possess strong head or falsetto tones, and it  may be that soprano boys who possess large voices, that is those which  show volume of tone along with purity, whose resonance cavities are  large, will prove to develop a better falsetto, as men, than those boys  whose voices are thinner. One other point remains to be disposed of.  Will the use of this voice by youth or adult, injure his other voice, be  it naturally bass, baritone, or tenor? No, it will not, and yet the  average choir-master will most assuredly be met with this objection or  fear. It is surprising that so many of those who are in the business of  trying to teach voice, should be ignorant of the character and range of  the male falsetto or head voice, but in spite of this ignorance, and  more or less prejudice against its use, the fear that by using it one  impairs the tones of the chest register or the usual singing voice, is  utterly unfounded. It is produced with far less effort and tension of  the vocal bands than is the chest voice, and is physiologically  perfectly safe. The mechanism which the larynx employs to produce the  falsetto is just as natural as the mechanism employed to produce the  chest voice. That it is an unusual voice with us is due to circumstances  of musical development. The advent of the male vested choir has,  however, created a demand for it, and it may be met as indicated, by  keeping boys upon the head voice during mutation or so much of the time  as is safe, and afterward, when the age of adolescence is past, even if  some prefer to sing bass or tenor, the number of those available for the  alto parts will be sufficient to meet all requirements.          CHAPTER IX.    GENERAL REMARKS.      In the preceding chapters, dealing as they do with special subjects or  subdivisions of the main topic, the effort has been to point out and to  suggest some ways in which good vocal habits may be taught, and simple  and effective vocal training carried on with whatever materials there  may be at hand in the shape of books, charts, blackboards, staves, etc.  The leading idea is the correct use of the voice; the particular song or  exercise which maybe sung is of no special importance; the way in which  it is sung is everything.    The benefits of teaching music _reading_ in the schools are a matter of  daily comment. Is it, then, likely that the good resulting from the  formation of correct habits in the use of the voice will fail of  recognition? Not so. For the effect of good vocal training in school  music would be so general and so beneficent that even unfriendly critics  might be silenced.    The first effect upon singing when the thick tone is forbidden and the  attempt made to substitute the use of the voice in the thin or head  register may be disappointing. It will seem to take away all life and  vigor from the singing. Teachers who enjoy _hearty_ singing will get  nervous; they will doubt the value of the innovation. In those grades  where children range in age from twelve to fourteen years, the apparent  loss in vocal power will disconcert the pupils even. Never mind; the  _use_ of the thin register will demonstrate its excellences, and it  will, if slowly yet surely, increase in brilliance and telling quality  of tone.    Again, the compass downward needs to be more restricted at first than  after the children have become habituated to its use. As long as there  is any marked tendency to break into the chest-voice at certain pitches,  the compass should be kept above them; as the tendency weakens, the  voice may with due caution be carried to the lower tones, in higher  grades be it understood. The tone should grow softer as the voice  descends when the lower notes will sound mellow and sweet. At first they  may be quite breathy, but as the vocal bands become accustomed to the  new action, the breathiness will disappear. One thing at a time is  enough to attempt in music, and while a change in the use of the voice  is being sought, it may happen that sacrifices must be made in other  directions; part-singing, until the voices become equalized, that is, of  a similar tone-quality throughout the entire compass, may, as it  requires the singing of tones so low as to occasion easy recurrence to  the thick voice, be so antagonistic to the desired end that it must be  dropped for a time. After the use of the thin voice has become firmly  established, part-singing may be resumed. How low in pitch the lower  part may with safety be carried depends partly upon the age of the  pupils; but until the chest-voice begins to develop at puberty, all  part-singing must be sung very lightly as to the lower part or voice.    There is a class of pupils always to be found in our schools who cannot  sing in tune; they vary in the degree of their inability from those who  can sing only in monotone, to those who can sing in tune when singing  with those whose sense of pitch is good, but alone, cannot. While the  number of entire or partial monotone voices decreases under daily drill  and instruction, yet there always remains a troublesome few, insensible  to distinctions in pitch; it is, in view of the possible improvement  they may make, a difficult matter to deal with them; for if they are  forbidden to sing, the chance to improve is denied them, and if they  sing and constantly drag down the pitch, why the intonation of those who  would otherwise sing true is injuriously affected.    Many who sing monotone when the thick voice is used, do so because the  throat is weak and cannot easily sustain the muscular strain; if they  are trained to the use of the light, thin tone, they can sing in tune.  After children have been under daily music drill for two or three years  in school, if they still sing monotone, it would seem inadvisable to let  them participate with the class in singing. They do themselves no good,  and they certainly injure the singing of the others; for, as before  suggested, constant falling from pitch will in time dull the musical  perceptions of those most gifted by nature.    During the early years of school-life the pupils may often sing out of  tune because the vocal bands and controlling muscles are very weak.    It is an excellent idea to separate the pupils into two classes: First,  those who can sing with reasonably good intonation; and second, those  who can sing only a few tones, or only one.    Let the second class frequently listen while the others sing. They will  thus be taught to note both tone and pitch, and if any musical sense is  dormant, this should arouse it; but, if after long and patient effort a  pupil cannot sing, let him remain silent during the singing period.    Every possible effort should certainly be put forth to teach children to  sing in tune, but yet it is now, and will doubtless remain true, that a  small per cent. cannot be so taught.    The primary causes of monotone singing may be physical or mental; in  many cases, weak vocal organs and feeble nervous power, in others lack  of pitch-perception-- tonal blindness.    The secondary causes include the influences of environment and heredity.  The contempt in which music has been held by a portion of the  English-speaking people from the time of the Reformation until quite  recently, or shall we say until even now, has made its powerful impress  upon opinions, tastes, and natural powers. Singing, with a part of our  population, is literally a lost art, lost through generations of disuse.    It is often urged by educators that each study must help other studies.  The various subjects which are taught must move along, as it were, like  the parts in a musical composition, dependent upon, sustaining, and  harmonious with each other. Now, while it is not within the scope of  this work to discuss the relation of music to other studies in all of  its bearings, it is yet clearly in line with its general tenor to  suggest that the tone in singing will react upon the speaking-voice, and  _vice versa_.    Now, if pupils recite and speak with a noisy, rough tone, it will not be  easy to secure sweet, pure tone from them when they sing; but, on the  other hand, while they may be specially trained in good singing-tone, it  will not, as a result, follow that the speaking-voice will be similarly  modified. Special attention must be given to this also; but if children  invariably sing with pure tone, it must be very easy to direct them into  good vocal habits in speaking and reading.    It is no more necessary for children to recite in that horrible, rasping  tone sometimes heard, than it is to sing with harsh tone; and if the  same principles are applied to the speaking-voice as are herein given  for the management of the singing-voice, in so far as they may be  applicable, this harshness and coarseness may be avoided. It is the  pushed, forced tone in speech or song that is disagreeable.    If teachers will consign to well-merited oblivion those two phrases,  \"speak up\" and \"sing out,\" and will, instead, secure purity and easy  production of tone, with _distinctness of articulation_, they will do  wisely. Let us not hesitate to teach our pupils to know and to feel that  which is beautiful, and good, and true, that our schools may promote the  growth of good taste, and stand for the highest morality and the best  culture.           *       *       *       *       *             *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *    Errors and Inconsistencies:      to justify the teaching of vocal music in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#14)"],[1,"that John Jay had been counted out, the people of the  State were aroused to the wildest passion of rage, recalling the  famous Tilden-Hayes controversy three-quarters of a century later. A  returning board, it was claimed, had overturned the will of the  people; and to the superheated excitement of the campaign, was added  the fierce anger of an outraged party. Wild menaces were uttered, and  the citizens of Otsego threatened an appeal to arms. \"People are  running in continually,\" wrote Mrs. Jay to her husband, \"to vent their  vexation. Senator King says he thinks Clinton as lawfully governor of  Connecticut as of New York, but he knows of no redress.\"[65] Hamilton  agreed with King, and counselled peaceful submission.    [Footnote 65: _Jay MSS._]    Meantime the Chief Justice was returning home from Vermont by way of  Albany. At Lansingburgh the people met him, and from thence to New  York public addresses and public dinners were followed with the roar  of artillery and the shouts of the populace. \"Though abuse of power  may for a time deprive you and the citizens of their right,\" said one  committee, \"we trust the sacred flame of liberty is not so far  extinguished in the bosoms of Americans as tamely to submit to the  shackles of slavery, without at least a struggle to shake them  off.\"[66] Citizens of New York met him eight miles from the city, and  upon his arrival, \"the friends of liberty\" condemned the men who would  deprive him of the high office \"in contempt of the sacred voice of the  people, in defiance of the Constitution, and in violation of the  uniform practice and settled principles of law.\"[67]    [Footnote 66: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 290.]    [Footnote 67: _Ibid._, p. 292.]    During these days of excitement, Jay conducted himself with remarkable  forbearance and dignity. It was the poise of Washington. \"The  reflection that the majority of electors were for me is a pleasing  one,\" he wrote his wife; \"that injustice has taken place does not  surprise me, and I hope will not affect you very sensibly. The  intelligence found me perfectly prepared for it. A few years more will  put us all in the dust, and it will then be of more importance to me  to have governed myself than to have governed the State.\"[68] This  thought influenced his conduct throughout. When armed resistance  seemed inevitable, he raised his voice in opposition to all feeling.  \"Every consideration of propriety forbids that difference in opinion  respecting candidates should suspend or interrupt that natural good  humour which harmonises society, and softens the asperities incident  to human life and human affairs.\"[69] At a large dinner on the 4th of  July, Jay gave the toast: \"May the people always respect themselves,  and remember what they owe to posterity;\" but after he had retired,  the banqueters let loose their tongues, drinking to \"John Jay,  Governor by voice of the people,\" and to \"the Governor (of right) of  the State of New York.\"    [Footnote 68: _Ibid._, p. 289.]    [Footnote 69: _Ibid._, p. 293.]    Clinton entered upon his sixth term as governor amidst vituperation  and obloquy. He was known as the \"Usurper,\" and in order to reduce him  to a mere figurehead, the Federalists who controlled the Assembly, led  by Josiah Ogden Hoffman, the brilliant New York lawyer, now proposed  to choose a new Council of Appointment, although the term of the old  Council had not yet expired. The Constitution provided that the  Council should hold office one year, and that the Governor, with the  advice of the Council, should appoint to office. Up to this time such  had been the accepted practice. Nevertheless, the Federalists, having  a majority of the Assembly, forced the election of a Council made up  entirely of members of their own party, headed by Philip Schuyler, the  veteran legislator and soldier, and then proceeded to nominate and  confirm Egbert Benson as a judge of the Supreme Court. Clinton, as  governor and a member of the Council, refused to nominate Benson,  insisting that the exclusive right of nomination was vested in him.  Here the matter should have ended under the Constitution as Jay  interpreted it; but Schuyler held otherwise, claiming that the Council  had a concurrent right to nominate. He went further, and decided that  whenever the law omitted to limit the number of officers, the Council  might do it, and whenever an officer must be commissioned annually,  another might be put in his place at the expiration of his commission.  This would give the Council power to increase at will the number of  officials not otherwise limited by law, and to displace every  anti-Federalist at the expiration of his commission.    Clinton argued that the governor, being charged under the Constitution  with the execution of the laws, was vested with exclusive discretion  as to the number of officers necessary to their execution, whereas, if  left to one not responsible for such execution, too many or too few  officials might be created. With respect to the continuation of an  incumbent in office at the pleasure of the Council, \"the Constitution  did not intend,\" he said, \"a capricious, arbitrary pleasure, but a  sound discretion to be exercised for the promotion of the public good;  that a contrary practice would deprive men of their offices because  they have too much independence of spirit to support measures they  suppose injurious to the community, and might induce others from undue  attachment to office to sacrifice their integrity to improper  considerations.\"[70] This was good reasoning and good prophecy; but  his protests fell upon ears as deaf to a wise policy as did the  protests of Jay's friends when the board of canvassers counted Jay out  and Clinton in.    [Footnote 70: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.  1, p. 84.]    The action of the Council of Appointment was a stunning blow to  Clinton. Under Jay's constitution, every officer in city, county, and  State, civil and military, save governor, lieutenant-governor, members  of the Legislature, and aldermen, could now be appointed by the  Council regardless of the Governor; and already these appointments  mounted up into hundreds. In 1821 they numbered over fifteen thousand.  Thus, as if by magic, the Council was turned into a political machine.  Under this arrangement, a party only needed a majority of the Assembly  to elect a Council which made all appointments, and the control of  appointments was sufficient to elect a majority of the Assembly. Thus  it was an endless chain the moment the Council became a political  machine, and it became a political machine the moment Philip Schuyler  headed the Council of 1793.    This arbitrary proceeding led to twenty years of corrupt methods and  political scandals. Schuyler's justification was probably the  conviction that poetic justice required that Clinton, having become  governor without right, should have his powers reduced to their lowest  terms; but whatever the motive, his action was indefensible, and his  reply that the Governor's practices did not correspond to his precepts  fell for want of proof. Clinton had then been in office seventeen  years, and, although he took good care to select members of his own  party, only one case, and that a doubtful one, could be cited in  support of the charge that appointments had been made solely for  political purposes.    In a published address, on January 22, 1795, Governor Clinton declined  to stand for re-election in the following April because of ill health  and neglected private affairs. Included in this letter was the  somewhat apocryphal statement that he withdrew from an office never  solicited, which he had accepted with diffidence, and from which he  should retire with pleasure. The reader who has followed the story of  his career through the campaigns of 1789 and 1792 will scarcely  believe him serious in this declaration, although he undoubtedly  retired with pleasure. At the time of his withdrawal, he had an attack  of inflammatory rheumatism, but he was neither a sick man nor an old  one, being then in his fifty-fifth year, with twelve years of  honourable public life still before him. It is likely the reason in  the old rhyme, \"He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another  day,\" had more to do with his retirement than shattered health and  crippled fortune. Defeat has never been regarded helpful to future  political preferment, and this shrewd reader of the signs of the  times, his ambition already fixed on higher honours and more exalted  place, saw the coming political change in New York as clearly and  unmistakably as an approaching storm announced itself in an increase  of his rheumatic aches.          CHAPTER VII    RECOGNITION OF EARNEST MEN    1795-1800      With Clinton out of the race for governor in 1795, his party's  weakness discovered itself in the selection of Chief Justice Robert  Yates, Hamilton's coalition candidate in 1789. It was a makeshift  nomination, since none cared to run after Clinton's declination  sounded a note of defeat. Yates' passion for office led him into  strange blunders. He seemed willing to become the candidate of any  party, under any conditions, at any time, if only he could step into  the official shoes of George Clinton. He was excusable in 1789,  perhaps, when the way opened up a fair chance of success, but in 1795  his ambition subjected him to ridicule as well as to humiliation. It  was said derisively that he was defeated, although every freeholder in  the State had voted for him.    The Federalists were far from unanimous in their choice of John Jay.  He had not yet returned from England, whither Washington had sent him  in the preceding year to negotiate a treaty to recover, among other  things, compensation for negroes who followed English troops across  the Atlantic at the close of the war; to obtain a surrender of the  Western military posts not yet"]]]
