You will find some comfort in so doing, since it is certain  that the unfortunate find relief in making known their distress.\" \"I  will not refuse your request,\" replied the young man, \"though I cannot  comply without renewing my grief. But I give you notice beforehand, to  prepare your ears, your mind, and even your eyes, for things which  surpass all that the imagination can conceive.\"          THE HISTORY OF THE YOUNG KING OF THE BLACK ISLES      \"You must know, my lord,\" said the wretched prisoner, \"that my father,  named Mahmoud, was monarch of this country. This is the kingdom of the  Black Isles, which takes its name from the four small neighbouring  mountains; for those mountains were formerly isles, and the capital  where the king, my father, resided was situated on the spot now occupied  by the lake you have seen. The sequel of my history will inform you of  the reason for those changes.    \"The king, my father, died when he was seventy years of age; I had no  sooner succeeded him than I married, and the lady I chose to share the  royal dignity with me was my cousin. I had so much reason to be  satisfied with her affection, and, on my part, loved her with so much  tenderness, that nothing could surpass the harmony of our union. This  lasted five years, at the end of which time I perceived the queen ceased  to delight in my attentions.    \"One day, after dinner, while she was at the bath, I found myself  inclined to repose, and lay down upon a sofa. Two of her ladies, who  were then in my chamber, came and sat down, one at my head and the other  at my feet, with fans in their hands to moderate the heat, and to  prevent the flies from disturbing me. They thought I was asleep, and  spoke in whispers; but as I only closed my eyes, I heard all their  conversation.    \"One of them said to the other, 'Is not the queen wrong, not to love so  amiable a prince?' 'Certainly,' replied her companion; 'I do not  understand the reason, neither can I conceive why she goes out every  night, and leaves him alone! Is it possible that he does not perceive  it?' 'Alas!' said the first, 'how should he? She mixes every evening in  his liquor the juice of a certain herb, which makes him sleep so sound  all night that she has time to go where she pleases, and as day begins  to appear she comes and wakes him by the smell of something she puts  under his nostrils.'    \"You may guess, my lord, how much I was surprised at this conversation,  and with what sentiments it inspired me; yet whatever emotion it excited  I had sufficient self-command to dissemble, and feigned to awake without  having heard a word.    \"The queen returned from the bath, we supped together, and she presented  me with a cup full of such liquid as I was accustomed to drink; but  instead of putting it to my mouth, I went to a window that was open,  threw out the water so quickly that she did not perceive it, and  returned.    \"Soon after, believing that I was asleep, she arose with so little  precaution, that she whispered loud enough for me to hear her  distinctly, 'Sleep on, and may you never wake again!' and so saying, she  dressed herself, and went out of the chamber.    \"As soon as the queen, my wife, was gone, I arose in haste, took my  cimeter, and followed her so quickly that I soon heard the sound of her  feet before me, and then walked softly after her. She passed through  several gates, which opened upon her pronouncing some magical words, and  the last she opened was that of the garden, which she entered. I stopped  at this gate, that she might not perceive me as she passed along a  parterre; then looking after her as far as the darkness of the night  permitted, I saw her enter a little wood, whose walks were guarded by  thick palisadoes. I went thither by another way, and concealing myself,  I saw her walking there with a man.    \"I did not fail to lend the most attentive ear to their discourse, and  heard her address herself thus to her gallant: 'I do not deserve,' she  said, 'to be reproached by you for want of diligence. You well know the  reason; but if all the proofs of affection I have already given you be  not sufficient to convince you of my sincerity, I am ready to give you  others more decisive: you need but command me, you know my power; I  will, if you desire it, before sunrise convert this great city, and this  superb palace, into frightful ruins, inhabited only by wolves, owls, and  ravens. If you would have me transport all the stones of those walls so  solidly built, beyond Mount Caucasus, the bounds of the habitable world,  speak but the word, and all shall be changed.'    \"As the queen finished this speech she and her companion came to the end  of the walk, turned to enter another, and passed before me. I had  already drawn my cimeter, and the man being next me, I struck him on the  neck, and brought him to the ground. I concluded I had killed him, and  therefore retired speedily without making myself known to the queen,  whom I chose to spare, because she was my kinswoman.    \"The wound I had given her companion was mortal; but by her enchantments  she preserved him in an existence in which he could not be said to be  either dead or alive. As I crossed the garden to return to the palace, I  heard the queen loudly lamenting, and judging by her cries how much she  was grieved, I was pleased that I had spared her life.    \"As soon as I had reached my apartment, I went to bed, and being  satisfied with having punished the villain who had injured me, fell  asleep.    \"Next morning I arose, went to my closet, and dressed myself. I  afterward held my council. At my return, the queen, clad in mourning,  her hair dishevelled, and part of it torn off, presented herself before  me, and said: 'I come to beg your majesty not to be surprised to see me  in this condition. My heavy affliction is occasioned by intelligence of  three distressing events which I have just received.' 'Alas! what are  they, madam?' said I. 'The death of the queen, my dear mother,' she  replied, 'that of the king, my father, killed in battle, and of one of  my brothers, who has fallen down a precipice.'    \"I was not displeased that she used these pretexts to conceal the true  cause of her grief. 'Madam,' said I, 'so far from blaming, I assure you  I heartily commiserate your sorrow. I should feel surprise if you were  insensible to such heavy calamities: weep on; your tears are so many  proofs of your tenderness; but I hope that time and reflection will  moderate your grief.'    \"She retired into her apartment, where, giving herself wholly up to  sorrow, she spent a whole year in mourning and lamentation. At the end  of that period, she begged permission to erect a burying-place for  herself, within the bounds of the palace, where she would continue, she  told me, to the end of her days: I consented, and she built a stately  edifice, and called it the Palace of Tears. When it was finished, she  caused the object of her care to be conveyed thither; she had hitherto  prevented his dying, by potions which she had administered to him; and  she continued to convey them to him herself every day after he came to  the Palace of Tears.    \"Yet, with all her enchantments, she could not cure the wretch; he was  not only unable to walk or support himself, but had also lost the use of  his speech, and exhibited no sign of life except in his looks.    \"Every day the queen made him two long visits. I was well apprised of  this, but pretended ignorance. One day my curiosity induced me to go to  the Palace of Tears, to observe how my consort employed herself, and  from a place where she could not see me, I heard her thus address the  wounded ruffian: 'I am afflicted to the highest degree to behold you in  this condition,' she cried, 'I am as sensible as yourself of the  tormenting pain you endure; but, dear soul, I am continually speaking to  you, and you do not answer me: how long will you remain silent? Speak  only one word: alas! the sweetest moments of my life are these I spend  here in partaking of your grief.'    \"At these words, which were several times interrupted by her sighs, I  lost all patience: and discovering myself, came up to her, and said,  'Madam, you have wept enough, it is time to give over this sorrow, which  dishonours us both; you have too much forgotten what you owe to me and  to yourself.' 'Sire,' said she, 'if you have any kindness or compassion  for me left, I beseech you to put no restraint upon me; allow me to  indulge my grief, which it is impossible for time to assuage.'    \"When I perceived that my remonstrance, instead of restoring her to a  sense of duty, served only to increase her anguish, I ceased speaking  and retired. She continued every day to visit her charge, and for two  whole years abandoned herself to grief and despair.    \"I went a second time to the Palace of Tears, while she was there. I  concealed myself again, and heard her thus cry out: 'It is now three  years since you spoke one word to me; you answer not the proofs I give  you of my devotion by my sighs and lamentations. Is it from  insensibility, or contempt? O tomb! tell me by what miracle thou  becamest the depository of the rarest treasure the world ever  contained.'    \"I must confess, my lord, I was enraged at these expressions; for, in  truth, this adored mortal was by no means what you would imagine him to  have been. He was a black Indian, one of the original natives of this  country. I was so enraged at the language addressed to him, that I  discovered myself, and apostrophising the tomb in my turn, I cried, 'O  tomb! why dost thou not swallow up that monster so revolting to human  nature, or rather why dost thou not swallow up this pair of monsters?'    \"I had scarcely uttered these words, when the queen, who sat by the  black,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#14)"],[1,"the morning to the congregations severally  from the Choir, St. Mary's Church, and Holy Trinity Church, who  assembled together, and occupied generally seats provided by  themselves, in the Octagon and the two bays east of it, the third  being taken up by the screen dividing it from the Choir with the organ  loft over. The sermons were usually preached by the Canon in residence  at the time.]    This will be better understood by reference to the accompanying plans,  (for the use of which we are indebted to the kindness of the Editor of  the \"Architectural Quarterly Review,\") one shewing the position of the  Choir previous to the year 1770, and the other the arrangement made at  the last alteration.

The screen was designed  by Sir G.G. Scott, and executed by Mr. Rattee; the statuettes by M.  Abeloos, and the brass gates with the foliage in the lower panels by  Mr. Hardman: the whole testifies highly to the taste of the designer  as well as to the skill of those who executed the several parts.    In making a particular survey of the Choir, it would perhaps be better  to examine carefully the architecture of the six eastern bays first,  and then the three western bays, which were built subsequently to the  others, before examining the reredos, monuments, &c.; this is simply a  suggestion, we leave the visitor to follow his own inclination, and  continue our description in the order of our course from west to east.    The architecture of the three first bays is greatly to be admired as a  specimen of the Decorated style, perhaps not surpassed by any other in  the kingdom; they were erected about the same time as the Octagon, and  most probably under the superintendence of the same skilful architect,  and for which purpose Bishop Hotham left a sum of money at his death;  they were built during the episcopate of his successors, Bishops  Montacute (1337-1345), and L'Isle (1345-1361). The lower columns are  nearly, the capitals entirely, of the same form with those of the  Octagon, but the arches are more ornamented, some of them having  bosses of foliage attached to their mouldings; and those of the  triforium are, as Mr. Bentham observes, \"embellished with tracery work  of such elegance and delicacy as seems scarcely consistent with  strength.\" Between each of the lower arches is a corbel or elongated  bracket profusely adorned with foliage carved in high relief, richly  coloured and gilded; from this rises a column between the upper  arches, and from the top of this column spring the ribs of the  vaulting, which spread in lavish ramifications over it, dividing it  into angular compartments, and at the angles are flowers and other  ornaments, curiously carved, and originally were coloured. In the  spandrils of the lower and triforium arches (with the exception of the  first bay on the south side, which contains the arms of the see, those  of Bishop Hotham, and another shield), are sunk trefoils, some of  which are painted dark blue relieved with small stars in gold, having  an elegant appearance. The range of pierced parapet at the bases of  the triforium and clerestory has been entirely renewed; and on the  south side, the triforium roof (which on both sides is of bare  rafters,) has been recently painted and ornamented in a style similar  to those of the Transept. The windows in the clerestory are large,  filling the whole opening, having in each four lights with rich  tracery, and the same kind of trellis-work we noticed in the large  windows in the Octagon; these windows, on both sides have been  recently filled with stained glass, executed by Mr. Wailes, the  expense defrayed out of the balance of the accumulated fund for the  east window; the subjects are illustrative of two verses of the \"Te  Deum,\" with figures of angels and the arms of the donor, &c., in the  tracery:         NORTH SIDE--\"_The noble army of Martyrs_\"--represented in       the western window by figures of St. George, St. Agnes, St.       Catharine, and St. Alban; middle window--St. Lawrence, St.       Cecilia, St. Justin, and St. Prisca; eastern window--St.       Ignatius, St. Polycarp, St. Lucian, and St. Stephen.         SOUTH SIDE--\"_The Holy Church throughout all the World_,\"       the Eastern Church being represented in the western window       by figures of St. Chrysostom, St. Basil, St. Athanasius, and       St. Gregory Nazienzen; the Western Church in the middle       window, by figures of St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St.       Augustine, and St. Gregory the great; the British Church in       the eastern window, by figures of St. Columba, St. David,       the Venerable Bede, and St. Augustine of Canterbury.    The absence of a bishop's throne is peculiar to this Cathedral; the  bishop occupies the return stall on the south side, and the dean that  on the north; those seats being generally appropriated to the dean and  sub dean. When the abbacy was converted into a bishopric (A.D. 1109)  the bishop took the seat previously held by the abbot, the prior  retaining his own; and, on the re-foundation in 1541, the dean took  the seat previously used by the priors, and here occupies  traditionally the side opposite to his customary position.    On the right hand of the entrance, therefore, is the seat of the  bishop, and on the left hand that of the dean, both surmounted by  lofty pinnacles of tabernacle work; and the ancient stalls, formerly  used under the Octagon, extend on both sides to the length of the  three western bays. These, which we believe form the sole existing  specimen of stalls of that date in England, have been cleansed from  their coats of paint and restored, and harmonise well with the new  work: the canopies are rich and elaborate, and the panels in the upper  portions have recently been filled with sculptured groups illustrative  of Scripture history, those on the north side from the New, and those  on the south side from the Old Testament; they are beautifully  designed, and contribute greatly to the good effect of the whole.  These sculptures have been executed in oak by M. Abeloos, of Louvain,  (with one exception, \"the Nativity,\" by Mr. Philip,) and are the gifts  of various benefactors. They are placed in chronological order and,  as we proceed from west to east, the subjects may be noticed in the  positions described as follows.    NORTH SIDE.    The Annunciation.  The Salutation.  The Nativity.  The Presentation in the Temple.  The Adoration of the Magi.  The Murder of the Innocents.  The Flight into Egypt.  Jesus disputing with the Doctors.  The Baptism.  The Temptation.  The Miracle at Cana in Galilee.  The Transfiguration.  Mary anointing the Lord's feet.  The Betrayal.  Our Lord before Caiaphas.  Jesus mocked.  Pilate washing his hands.  Jesus scourged.  \"Behold the Man.\"  The Crucifixion.  The Entombment.  The Resurrection.  Our Lord at Emmaus.  The incredulity of Thomas.  The Ascension.    SOUTH SIDE.    The Creation of Man.  The Creation of Woman.  Adam and Eve in Paradise.  The Fall of Man.  The Expulsion from Paradise.  Adam and Eve at Work.  Cain killing Abel.  Noah building the Ark.  The Deluge.  Noah's Sacrifice.  Promise to Abraham.  Isaac carrying the wood.  Abraham's Sacrifice.  Isaac blessing Jacob.  Jacob's Dream.  Joseph sold by his Brethren.  The Burning Bush.  The Passover.  Moses striking the Rock.  Moses raising the brazen serpent.  Return of the Spies.  David anointed by Samuel.  Queen of Sheba's visit to Solomon.  Jonah.  Elijah's ascent to Heaven.    The sub-stalls are new, and of good design; the stall-ends in the  upper range have a series of statuettes of the principal among the  ancient benefactors, or of the builders of various portions of the  church, each under a canopy, and for finials they have figures of  angels with instruments of music. Each of the statuettes (where  finished) is represented as holding some type or model of the  particular portion with which its prototype is more intimately  connected. They were designed and modelled by Mr. J. Philip, and  executed partly by him and partly by Mr. Rattee; we append a list of  them in the order in which they are placed, commencing from the west,  as before:    NORTH"]]]
