His hands, half concealed  by sleeves of silk, white and crimson striped, were clasped upon  his knees. When he spoke, sometimes the first finger of the right  hand extended tremulously; he seemed incapable of other gesture.  But his head was a splendid dome. A few hairs, whiter than fine-drawn  silver, fringed the base; over a broad, full-sphered skull the skin  was drawn close, and shone in the light with positive brilliance;  the temples were deep hollows, from which the forehead beetled like  a wrinkled crag; the eyes were wan and dim; the nose was pinched;  and all the lower face was muffed in a beard flowing and venerable  as Aaron's. Such was Hillel the Babylonian! The line of prophets,  long extinct in Israel, was now succeeded by a line of scholars,  of whom he was first in learning--a prophet in all but the divine  inspiration! At the age of one hundred and six, he was still Rector  of the Great College.    On the table before him lay outspread a roll or volume of parchment  inscribed with Hebrew characters; behind him, in waiting, stood a  page richly habited.    There had been discussion, but at this moment of introduction the  company had reached a conclusion; each one was in an attitude of  rest, and the venerable Hillel, without moving, called the page.    \"Hist!\"    The youth advanced respectfully.    \"Go tell the king we are ready to give him answer.\"    The boy hurried away.    After a time two officers entered and stopped, one on each side  the door; after them slowly followed a most striking personage--an  old man clad in a purple robe bordered with scarlet, and girt  to his waist by a band of gold linked so fine that it was pliable  as leather; the latchets of his shoes sparkled with precious stones;  a narrow crown wrought in filigree shone outside a tarbooshe  of softest crimson plush, which, encasing his head, fell down  the neck and shoulders, leaving the throat and neck exposed.  Instead of a seal, a dagger dangled from his belt. He walked  with a halting step, leaning heavily upon a staff. Not until  he reached the opening of the divan, did he pause or look up  from the floor; then, as for the first time conscious of  the company, and roused by their presence, he raised himself,  and looked haughtily round, like one startled and searching for  an enemy--so dark, suspicious, and threatening was the glance.  Such was Herod the Great--a body broken by diseases, a conscience  seared with crimes, a mind magnificently capable, a soul fit for  brotherhood with the Caesars; now seven-and-sixty years old, but  guarding his throne with a jealousy never so vigilant, a power  never so despotic, and a cruelty never so inexorable.    There was a general movement on the part of the assemblage--a  bending forward in salaam by the more aged, a rising-up by the  more courtierly, followed by low genuflections, hands upon the  beard or breast.    His observations taken, Herod moved on until at the tripod opposite  the venerable Hillel, who met his cold glance with an inclination  of the head, and a slight lifting of the hands.    \"The answer!\" said the king, with imperious simplicity,  addressing Hillel, and planting his staff before him with  both hands. \"The answer!\"    The eyes of the patriarch glowed mildly, and, raising his head,  and looking the inquisitor full in the face, he answered,  his associates giving him closest attention,    \"With thee, O king, be the peace of God, of Abraham, Isaac,  and Jacob!\"    His manner was that of invocation; changing it, he resumed:    \"Thou hast demanded of us where the Christ should be born.\"    The king bowed, though the evil eyes remained fixed upon the  sage's face.    \"That is the question.\"    \"Then, O king, speaking for myself, and all my brethren here,  not one dissenting, I say, in Bethlehem of Judea.\"    Hillel glanced at the parchment on the tripod; and, pointing with  his tremulous finger, continued, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus  it is written by the prophet, 'And thou, Bethlehem, in the land  of Judea, art not the least among the princes of Judah; for out  of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel.'\"    Herod's face was troubled, and his eyes fell upon the parchment  while he thought. Those beholding him scarcely breathed; they spoke  not, nor did he. At length he turned about and left the chamber.    \"Brethren,\" said Hillel, \"we are dismissed.\"    The company then arose, and in groups departed.    \"Simeon,\" said Hillel again.    A man, quite fifty years old, but in the hearty prime of life,  answered and came to him.    \"Take up the sacred parchment, my son; roll it tenderly.\"    The order was obeyed.    \"Now lend me thy arm; I will to the litter.\"    The strong man stooped; with his withered hands the old one took  the offered support, and, rising, moved feebly to the door.    So departed the famous Rector, and Simeon, his son, who was to be  his successor in wisdom, learning, and office.    * * * * * *    Yet later in the evening the wise men were lying in a lewen of the  khan awake. The stones which served them as pillows raised their  heads so they could look out of the open arch into the depths of  the sky; and as they watched the twinkling of the stars, they thought  of the next manifestation. How would it come? What would it be?  They were in Jerusalem at last; they had asked at the gate for Him  they sought; they had borne witness of his birth; it remained only  to find him; and as to that, they placed all trust in the Spirit.  Men listening for the voice of God, or waiting a sign from Heaven,  cannot sleep.    While they were in this condition, a man stepped in under the arch,  darkening the lewen.    \"Awake!\" he said to them; \"I bring you a message which will not  be put off.\"    They all sat up.    \"From whom?\" asked the Egyptian.    \"Herod the king.\"    Each one felt his spirit thrill.    \"Are you not the steward of the khan?\" Balthasar asked next.    \"I am.\"    \"What would the king with us?\"    \"His messenger is without; let him answer.\"    \"Tell him, then, to abide our coming.\"    \"You were right, O my brother!\" said the Greek, when the steward  was gone. \"The question put to the people on the road, and to the  guard at the gate, has given us quick notoriety. I am impatient;  let us up quickly.\"    They arose, put on their sandals, girt their mantles about them,  and went out.    \"I salute you, and give you peace, and pray your pardon; but my  master, the king, has sent me to invite you to the palace, where he  would have speech with you privately.\"    Thus the messenger discharged his duty.    A lamp hung in the entrance, and by its light they looked at each  other, and knew the Spirit was upon them. Then the Egyptian stepped  to the steward, and said, so as not to be heard by the others,  \"You know where our goods are stored in the court, and where our  camels are resting. While we are gone, make all things ready for  our departure, if it should be needful.\"    \"Go your way assured; trust me,\" the steward replied.    \"The king's will is our will,\" said Balthasar to the messenger.  \"We will follow you.\"    The streets of the Holy City were narrow then as now, but not so  rough and foul; for the great builder, not content with beauty,  enforced cleanliness and convenience also. Following their guide,  the brethren proceeded without a word. Through the dim starlight,  made dimmer by the walls on both sides, sometimes almost lost  under bridges connecting the house-tops, out of a low ground  they ascended a hill. At last they came to a portal reared  across the way. In the light of fires blazing before it in two  great braziers, they caught a glimpse of the structure, and also  of some guards leaning motionlessly upon their arms. They passed  into a building unchallenged. Then by passages and arched halls;  through courts, and under colonnades not always lighted; up long  flights of stairs, past innumerable cloisters and chambers,  they were conducted into a tower of great height. Suddenly the  guide halted, and, pointing through an open door, said to them,    \"Enter. The king is there.\"    The air of the chamber was heavy with the perfume of sandal-wood,  and all the appointments within were effeminately rich. Upon the  floor, covering the central space, a tufted rug was spread, and  upon that a throne was set. The visitors had but time, however,  to catch a confused idea of the place--of carved and gilt ottomans  and couches; of fans and jars and musical instruments; of golden  candlesticks glittering in their own lights; of walls painted in  the style of the voluptuous Grecian school, one look at which had  made a Pharisee hide his head with holy horror. Herod, sitting upon  the throne to receive them, clad as when at the conference with the  doctors and lawyers, claimed all their minds.    At the edge of the rug, to which they advanced uninvited, they  prostrated themselves. The king touched a bell. An attendant  came in, and placed three stools before the throne.    \"Seat yourselves,\" said the monarch, graciously.    \"From the North Gate,\" he continued, when they were at rest,  \"I had this afternoon report of the arrival of three strangers,  curiously mounted, and appearing as if from far countries. Are you  the men?\"    The Egyptian took the sign from the Greek and the Hindoo,  and answered, with the profoundest salaam, \"Were we other  than we are, the mighty Herod, whose fame is as incense to the  whole world, would not have sent for us. We may not doubt that  we are the strangers.\"    Herod acknowledged the speech with a wave of the hand.    \"Who are you? Whence do you come?\" he asked, adding significantly,  \"Let each speak for himself.\"    In turn they gave him account, referring simply to the cities and  lands of their birth, and the routes by which they came to Jerusalem.  Somewhat disappointed, Herod plied them more directly.    \"What was the question you put to the officer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#14)"],[1,"could live.    Buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred  yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt  him grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his  splendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress  down-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where the  wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks  which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck of the  water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful,  and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped furiously  over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with crushing  force. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing Buck, and  above the roar of the churning water shouted: \"Go, Buck! Go!\"    Buck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling  desperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton's command  repeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as  though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam  powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point  where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.    They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face  of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as fast as  they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging  on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to  Buck's neck and shoulders, being careful that it should neither strangle  him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the stream. He struck  out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. He discovered the  mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen  strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past.    Hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The  rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked  under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body  struck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and  Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him  and the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The  faint sound of Thornton's voice came to them, and though they could not  make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His  master's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his  feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous  departure.    Again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck  out, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once,  but he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,  permitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on  till he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with  the speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him  coming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole  force of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both arms  around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and  Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,  sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the  jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the  bank.    Thornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back  and forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for  Buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a  howl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton was  himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over Buck's body,  when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.    \"That settles it,\" he announced. \"We camp right here.\" And camp they  did, till Buck's ribs knitted and he was able to travel.    That winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,  perhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the totem-pole  of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three  men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished, and were  enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East, where miners  had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a conversation in the  Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.  Buck, because of his record, was the target for these men, and Thornton  was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of half an hour one man  stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and  walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a third,  seven hundred.    \"Pooh! pooh!\" said John Thornton; \"Buck can start a thousand pounds.\"    \"And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?\" demanded  Matthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.    \"And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,\" John  Thornton said coolly.    \"Well,\" Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could  hear, \"I've got a thousand dollars that says he can't. And there it  is.\" So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna  sausage down upon the bar.    Nobody spoke. Thornton's bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He  could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had  tricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand pounds.  Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great faith in  Buck's strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a  load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes  of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had no  thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.    \"I've got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of  flour on it,\" Matthewson went on with brutal directness; \"so don't let  that hinder you.\"    Thornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from  face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of  thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start  it going again. The face of Jim O'Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time  comrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him  to do what he would never have dreamed of doing.    \"Can you lend me a thousand?\" he asked, almost in a whisper.    \"Sure,\" answered O'Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of  Matthewson's. \"Though it's little faith I'm having, John, that the beast  can do the trick.\"    The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The  tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see  the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred  and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson's  sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a  couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the  runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of two  to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose concerning  the phrase \"break out.\" O'Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege  to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to \"break it out\" from a dead  standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the  runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of the men who had  witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor, whereat the odds  went up to three to one against Buck.    There were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.  Thornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now that  he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team  of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible the  task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.    \"Three to one!\" he proclaimed. \"I'll lay you another thousand at that  figure, Thornton. What d'ye say?\"    Thornton's doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was  aroused--the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize  the impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He called  Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own the three  partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the ebb of  their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it  unhesitatingly against Matthewson's six hundred.    The team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was  put into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and  he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.  Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in  perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one  hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and  virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the neck and  across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half bristled and  seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of vigor made each  particular hair alive and active. The great breast and heavy fore legs  were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the  muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men felt these  muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went down to two  to one.    \"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king  of the Skookum Benches. \"I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before  the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.\"    Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck's side.    \"You must stand off from him,\" Matthewson protested. \"Free play and  plenty of room.\"    The crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of"]]]
