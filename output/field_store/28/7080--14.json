BLEACHING AND TREATMENT OF RAW MATERIALS INTENDED FOR SOAP-MAKING.         _Palm Oil--Cotton-seed Oil--Cotton-seed \"Foots\"--Vegetable       Oils--Animal Fats--Bone Fat--Rosin._      Having described the most important and interesting oils and fats used  or suggested for use in the manufacture of soap, let us now consider  briefly the methods of bleaching and treating the raw materials, prior  to their transference to the soap-pan.    _Crude Palm Oil._--Of the various methods suggested for bleaching palm  oil, the bichromate process originated by Watts is undoubtedly the best.  The reaction may be expressed by the following equation, though in  practice it is necessary to use twice the amount of acid required by  theory:--        K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 14HCl = 2KCl + Cr_{2}Cl_{6} + 7H_{2}O + 6Cl.        6Cl + 3H_{2}O = 6HCl + 3O.    The palm oil, freed from solid impurities by melting and subsidence, is  placed in the bleaching tank, and washed with water containing a little  hydrochloric acid. Having allowed it to rest, and drawn off the liquor  and sediment (chiefly sand), the palm oil is ready for treatment with  the bleaching reagent, which consists of potassium bichromate and  commercial muriatic acid. For every ton of oil, 22 to 28 lb. potassium  bichromate and 45 to 60 lb. acid will be found sufficient to produce a  good bleached oil.    The best procedure is to act upon the colouring matter of the oil three  successive times, using in the first two treatments one-third of the  average of the figures just given, and in the final treatment an  appropriate quantity which can be easily gauged by the appearance of a  cooled sample of the oil.    The potassium bichromate is dissolved in hot water and added to the  crude palm oil, previously heated to 125 deg. F. (52 deg. C.), the requisite  amount of muriatic acid being then run in and the whole well agitated by  means of air. The bright red colour of the oil gradually changes to dark  brown, and soon becomes green. The action having proceeded for a few  minutes, agitation is stopped, and, after allowing to settle, the green  liquor is withdrawn.    When sufficiently bleached the oil is finally washed (without further  heating) with hot water (which may contain salt), to remove the last  traces of chrome liquor.    If the above operation is carried out carefully, the colouring matter  will be completely oxidised.    It is important, however, that the temperature should not be allowed to  rise above 130 deg. F. (54 deg. C.) during the bleaching of palm oil, otherwise  the resultant oil on saponification is apt to yield a soap of a \"foxy\"  colour. The bleached oil retains the characteristic violet odour of the  original oil.    It has been suggested to use dilute sulphuric acid, or a mixture of this  and common salt, in the place of muriatic acid in the above process.    _Crude Cotton-seed Oil._--The deep colouring matter of crude cotton-seed  oil, together with the mucilaginous and resinous principles, are removed  by refining with caustic soda lye.    The chief aim of the refiner is to remove these impurities without  saponifying any of the neutral oil. The percentage of free fatty acids  in the oil will determine the quantity of caustic lye required, which  must only be sufficient to remove this acidity.    Having determined the amount of free acidity, the quantity of caustic  soda lye necessary to neutralise it is diluted with water to 12 deg. or 15 deg.  Tw. (8 deg. or 10 deg. B.), and the refining process carried out in three  stages. The oil is placed in a suitable tank and heated by means of a  closed steam coil to 100 deg. F. (38 deg. C.), a third of the necessary weak  caustic soda lye added in a fine stream or by means of a sprinkler, and  the whole well agitated with a mechanical agitator or by blowing a  current of air through a pipe laid on the bottom of the tank.    Prolonged agitation with air has a tendency to oxidise the oil, which  increases its specific gravity and refractive index, and will be found  in the soap-pan to produce a reddish soap. As the treatment proceeds,  the temperature may be carefully raised, by means of the steam coil, to  120 deg. F. (49 deg. C.).    The first treatment having proceeded fifteen minutes, the contents of  the tank are allowed to rest; the settling should be prolonged as much  as possible, say overnight, to allow the impurities to precipitate well,  and carry down the least amount of entangled oil. Having withdrawn these  coloured \"foots,\" the second portion of the weak caustic soda solution  is agitated with the partially refined oil, and, when the latter is  sufficiently treated, it is allowed to rest and the settled coloured  liquor drawn off as before. The oil is now ready for the final  treatment, which is performed in the same manner as the two previous  ones. On settling, a clear yellow oil separates.    If desired, the oil may be brightened and filtered, after refining to  produce a marketable article, but if it is being refined for own use in  the soap-house, this may be omitted.    The residue or \"foots\" produced during the refining of crude  cotton-seed oil, known in the trade as \"mucilage,\" may be converted into  \"soapstock\" as mentioned in the preceding chapter, or decomposed by a  mineral acid and made into \"black grease\" ready for distillation by  superheated steam.    _Vegetable Oils._--The other vegetable oils come to the soap-maker's  hand in a refined condition; occasionally, however, it is desirable to  remove a portion of the free fatty acids, which treatment also causes  the colouring matter to be preciptated. This is effected by bringing the  oil and a weak solution of caustic lye into intimate contact. Cocoa-nut  oil is often treated in this manner. Sometimes it is only necessary to  well agitate the oil with 1-1/2 per cent. of its weight of a 12 deg. Tw. (8 deg.  B.) solution of caustic soda and allow to settle. The foots are utilised  in the soap-pan.    _Animal Fats._--Tallows are often greatly improved by the above alkaline  treatment at 165 deg. F. (73 deg. C.). It is one of the best methods and  possesses advantages over acid processes--the caustic soda removes the  free acid and bodies of aldehyde nature, which are most probably the  result of oxidation or polymerisation, whereas the neutral fat is not  attacked, and further, the alkaline foots can be used in the production  of soap.    _Bone fat_ often contains calcium (lime) salts, which are very  objectionable substances in a soap-pan. These impurities must be removed  by a treatment with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. The former acid is  preferable, as the lime salt formed is readily soluble and easily  removed. The fat is agitated with a weak solution of acid in a  lead-lined tank by blowing in steam, and when the treatment is complete  and the waste liquor withdrawn, the last traces of acid are well washed  out of the liquid fat with hot water.    _Rosin._--Several methods have been suggested for bleaching rosin; in  some instances the constitution of the rosin is altered, and in others  the cost is too great or the process impracticable.    The aim of these processes must necessarily be the elimination of the  colouring matter without altering the original properties of the  substance. This is best carried out by converting the rosin into a  resinate of soda by boiling it with a solution of either caustic soda or  carbonated alkali. The process is commenced by heating 37 cwt. of 17 deg.  Tw. (11 deg. B.) caustic soda lye, and adding 20 cwt. of rosin, broken into  pieces, and continuing the boiling until all the resinate is  homogeneous, when an addition of 1-1/2 cwt. of salt is made and the  boiling prolonged a little. On resting, the coloured liquor rises to the  surface of the resinate, and may be siphoned off (or pumped away through  a skimmer pipe) and the resinate further washed with water containing a  little salt.    The treatment with carbonated alkali is performed in a similar manner. A  solution, consisting of 2-3/4 cwt. of soda ash (58 deg.), in about four  times its weight of water, is heated and 20 cwt. of rosin, broken into  small pieces, added. The whole is heated by means of the open steam  coil, and care must be taken to avoid boiling over. Owing to the  liberation of CO_{2} gas, frothing takes place. A large number of  patents have been granted for the preparation of resinate of soda, and  many methods devised to obviate the boiling over. Some suggest mixing  the rosin and soda ash (or only a portion of the soda ash) prior to  dissolving in water; others saponify in a boiler connected with a trap  which returns the resinate to the pan and allows the carbonic-acid gas  to escape or to be collected.    With due precaution the method can be easily worked in open vessels,  and, using the above proportions, there will be sufficient uncombined  rosin remaining to allow the resultant product to be pumped into the  soap with which it is intended to intermix it, where it will be finally  saponified thoroughly.    The salt required, which, in the example given, would be 1-1/2 cwt., may  be added to the solution prior to the addition of rosin or sprinkled in  towards the finish of the boiling. When the whole has been sufficiently  boiled and allowed to rest, the liquor containing the colouring matter  will float over the resinate, and, after removal, may be replaced by  another washing.    Many other methods have been suggested for the bleaching, refining and  treatment of materials intended for saponification, but the above  practical processes are successfully employed.    All fats and oils after being melted by the aid of steam must be allowed  to thoroughly settle, and the condensed water and impurities withdrawn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#14)"],[1,"one day are starving, and the  next are revelling in superabundance.    But to return to our story.  At one end of this village the creek sprang  over a ledge of rock in a low cascade and opened out into a beautiful  lake, the bosom of which was studded with small islands.  Here were  thousands of those smaller species of wild water-fowl which were either  too brave or too foolish to be scared away by the noise of the camp.  And here, too, dozens of children were sporting on the beach or paddling  about in their light bark canoes.    \"Isn't it strange,\" remarked Dick to Henri, as they passed among the  tents towards the centre of the village, \"isn't it strange that them  Injuns should be so fond o' fightin' when they've got all they can  want--a fine country, lots o' buffalo, an' as far as I can see, happy  homes?\"    \"Oui, it is remarkaibel, vraiment.  But dey do more love war to peace.  Dey loves to be excited, I s'pose.\"    \"Humph!  One would think the hunt we seed a little agone would be  excitement enough.  But, I say, that must be the chief's tent, by the  look o't.\"    Dick was right; the horsemen pulled up and dismounted opposite the  principal chief's tent, which was a larger and more elegant structure  than the others.  Meanwhile an immense concourse of women, children, and  dogs gathered round the strangers, and, while the latter yelped their  dislike to white men, the former chattered continuously, as they  discussed the appearance of the strangers and their errand, which latter  soon became known.  An end was put to this by San-it-sa-rish desiring  the hunters to enter the tent, and spreading a buffalo robe for them to  sit on.  Two braves carried in their packs and then led away their  horses.    All this time Crusoe had kept as close as possible to his master's side,  feeling extremely uncomfortable in the midst of such a strange crowd,  the more especially that the ill-looking Indian curs gave him expressive  looks of hatred, and exhibited some desire to rush upon him in a body,  so that he had to keep a sharp look out all round him.  When, therefore,  Dick entered the tent Crusoe endeavoured to do so along with him, but he  was met by a blow on the nose from an old squaw, who scolded him in a  shrill voice and bade him begone.    Either our hero's knowledge of the Indian language was insufficient to  enable him to understand the order, or he had resolved not to obey it,  for instead of retreating he drew a deep gurgling breath, curled his  nose, and displayed a row of teeth that caused the old woman to draw  back in alarm.  Crusoe's was a forgiving spirit.  The instant that  opposition ceased he forgot the injury, and was meekly advancing when  Dick held up his finger.    \"Go outside, pup, and wait.\"    Crusoe's tail drooped; with a deep sigh he turned and left the tent.  He  took up a position near the entrance, however, and sat down resignedly.  So meek, indeed, did the poor dog look, that six mangy-looking curs felt  their dastardly hearts emboldened to make a rush at him with boisterous  yells.    Crusoe did not rise.  He did not even condescend to turn his head toward  them, but he looked at them out of the corner of his dark eye,  wrinkled--very slightly--the skin of his nose, exhibited two beautiful  fangs, and gave utterance to a soft remark, that might be described as  quiet, deep-toned gargling.  It wasn't much, but it was more than enough  for the valiant six, who paused and snarled violently.    It was a peculiar trait of Crusoe's gentle nature, that, the moment any  danger ceased, he resumed his expression of nonchalant gravity.  The  expression on this occasion was misunderstood, however, and, as about  two dozen additional yelping dogs had joined the ranks of the enemy,  they advanced in close order to the attack.    Crusoe still sat quiet and kept his head high, but he _looked_ at them  again and exhibited four fangs for their inspection.  Among the pack  there was one Indian dog of large size--almost as large as Crusoe  himself--which kept well in the rear, and apparently urged the lesser  dogs on.  The little dogs didn't object, for little dogs are generally  the most pugnacious.  At this big dog Crusoe directed a pointed glance,  but said nothing.  Meanwhile a particularly small and vicious cur, with  a mere rag of a tail, crept round by the back of the tent, and, coming  upon Crusoe in the rear, snapped at his tail sharply, and then fled  shrieking with terror and surprise, no doubt, at its own temerity.    Crusoe did not bark; he seldom barked; he usually either said nothing,  or gave utterance to a prolonged roar of indignation of the most  terrible character with barks, as it were, mingled through it.  It  somewhat resembled that peculiar and well-known species of thunder, the  prolonged roll of which is marked at short intervals in its course by  cannon-like cracks.  It was a continuous, but, so to speak, _knotted_  roar.    On receiving the snap, Crusoe gave forth _the_ roar with a majesty and  power that scattered the pugnacious front rank of the enemy to the  winds.  Those that still remained, half stupefied, he leaped over with a  huge bound and alighted, fangs first, on the back of the big dog.  There  was one hideous yell, a muffled scramble of an instant's duration, and  the big dog lay dead upon the plain!    It was an awful thing to do; but Crusoe evidently felt that the peculiar  circumstances of the case required that an example should be made--and  to say truth, all things considered, we cannot blame him.  The news must  have been carried at once through the canine portion of the camp, for  Crusoe was never interfered with again after that.    Dick witnessed this little incident; but he observed that the Indian  chief cared not a straw about it, and as his dog returned quietly and  sat down in its old place, he took no notice of it either, but continued  to listen to the explanations which Joe gave to the chief, of the desire  of the Pale-faces to be friends with the Red-men.    Joe's eloquence would have done little for him on this occasion had his  hands been empty; but he followed it up by opening one of his packs, and  displaying the glittering contents before the equally glittering eyes of  the chief and his squaws.    \"These,\" said Joe, \"are the gifts that the great chief of the Pale-faces  sends to the great chief of the Pawnees, and he bids me say that there  are many more things in his stores which will be traded for skins with  the Red-men, when they visit him; and he also says that if the Pawnees  will not steal horses any more from the Pale-faces they shall receive  gifts of knives, and guns, and powder and blankets every year.\"    \"_Wah_!\" grunted the chief; \"it is good.  The great chief is wise.  We  will smoke the pipe of peace.\"    The things that afforded so much satisfaction to San-it-sa-rish were the  veriest trifles.  Penny looking-glasses in yellow gilt tin frames, beads  of various colours, needles, cheap scissors, and knives, vermilion  paint, and coarse scarlet cloth, etcetera.  They were of priceless  value, however, in the estimation of the savages, who delighted to adorn  themselves with leggings made from the cloth, beautifully worked with  beads by their own ingenious women.  They were thankful, too, for knives  even of the commonest description, having none but bone ones of their  own; and they gloried in daubing their faces with intermingled streaks  of charcoal and vermilion.  To gaze at their visages, when thus treated,  in the little penny looking-glasses is their summit of delight!    Joe presented the chief with a portion of these coveted goods and tied  up the remainder.  We may remark here, that the only thing which  prevented the savages from taking possession of the whole at once,  without asking permission, was the promise of the annual gifts, which  they knew would not be forthcoming were any evil to befall the deputies  of the Pale-faces.  Nevertheless, it cost them a severe struggle to  restrain their hands on this occasion, and Joe and his companions felt  that they would have to play their part well in order to fulfil their  mission with safety and credit.    \"The Pale-faces may go now and talk with the braves,\" said  San-it-sa-rish, after carefully examining everything that was given to  him; \"a council will be called soon, and we will smoke the pipe of  peace.\"    Accepting this permission to retire, the hunters immediately left the  tent, and being now at liberty to do what they pleased, they amused  themselves by wandering about the village.    \"He's a cute chap that,\" remarked Joe, with a sarcastic smile; \"I don't  feel quite easy about gettin' away.  He'll bother the life out o' us to  get all the goods we've got, and, ye see, as we've other tribes to  visit, we must give away as little as we can here.\"    \"Ha! you is right,\" said Henri; \"dat fellow's eyes twinkle at de knives  and tings like two stars.\"    \"Fire-flies, ye should say.  Stars are too soft an' beautiful to compare  to the eyes o' yon savage,\" said Dick, laughing.  \"I wish we were well  away from them.  That rascal Mahtawa is an ugly customer.\"    \"True, lad,\" returned Joe; \"had _he_ bin the great chief our scalps had  bin dryin' in the smoke o' a Pawnee wigwam afore now.  What now, lad?\"    Joe's question was put in consequence of a gleeful smile that overspread  the countenance of Dick Varley, who replied by pointing to a wigwam  towards which they were approaching.    \"Oh! that's only a dandy,\" exclaimed Joe.  \"There's lots o' them in  every Injun camp.  They're fit for nothin' but dress, poor contemptible  critters.\"    Joe accompanied his remark with a sneer, for of all pitiable objects, he  regarded an unmanly man as the most despicable.  He consented, however,  to sit down on a grassy bank and watch the proceedings of this Indian  dandy, who had just seated himself in front of his wigwam for the  purpose of making his toilet.
