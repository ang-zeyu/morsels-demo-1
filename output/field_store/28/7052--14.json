It was the children's  \"Reader.\" As the boys and girls grew up in the Brethren's Church, they  learned to read, not in national schools, but in their own homes; and  thus the Brethren did for the children what ought to have been done by  the State. Among them the duties of a father were clearly defined. He  was both a schoolmaster and a religious instructor. He was the priest in  his own family. He was to bring his children up in the Christian faith.  He was not to allow them to roam at pleasure, or play with the wicked  children of the world. He was to see that they were devout at prayers,  respectful in speech, and noble and upright in conduct. He was not to  allow brothers and sisters to sleep in the same room, or boys and girls  to roam the daisied fields together. He was not to strike his children  with a stick or with his fists. If he struck them at all, he must do so  with a cane. Above all, he had to teach his children the Catechism. They  were taught by their parents until they were twelve years old; they were  then taken in hand by their sponsors; and thus they were prepared for  Confirmation, not as in the Anglican Church, by a clergyman only, but  partly by their own parents and friends.    The Brethren's rules struck deeper still. For law and order the Brethren  had a passion. Each congregation was divided into three classes:  the Beginners, those who were learning the \"Questions\" and the first  elements of religion; the Proficients, the steady members of the Church;  and the Perfect, those so established in faith, hope and love as to  be able to enlighten others. For each class a separate Catechism was  prepared. At the head, too, of each congregation was a body of civil  Elders. They were elected by the congregation from the Perfect. They  assisted the pastor in his parochial duties. They looked after his  support in case he were in special need. They acted as poor-law  guardians, lawyers, magistrates and umpires, and thus they tried to  keep the people at peace and prevent them from going to law. Every three  months they visited the houses of the Brethren, and inquired whether  business were honestly conducted, whether family worship were held,  whether the children were properly trained. For example, it was one  of the duties of a father to talk with his children at the Sunday  dinner-table on what they had heard at the morning service; and when  the Elder paid his quarterly visit he soon discovered, by examining the  children, how far this duty had been fulfilled.    The Brethren's rules struck deeper still. For the labourer in the field,  for the artizan in the workshop, for the tradesman with his wares, for  the baron and his tenants, for the master and his servants, there were  laws and codes to suit each case, and make every trade and walk in life  serve in some way to the glory of God. Among the Brethren all work was  sacred. If a man was not able to show that his trade was according to  the law of Christ and of direct service to His holy cause, he was not  allowed to carry it on at all. He must either change his calling or  leave the Church. In the Brethren's Church there were no dice makers, no  actors, no painters, no professional musicians, no wizards or seers, no  alchemists, no astrologers, no courtezans or panderers. The whole  tone was stern and puritanic. For art, for music, for letters and for  pleasure the Brethren had only contempt, and the fathers were warned  against staying out at night and frequenting the card-room and the  liquor-saloon. And yet, withal, these stern Brethren were kind and  tender-hearted. If the accounts handed down are to be believed, the  villages where the Brethren settled were the homes of happiness and  peace. As the Brethren had no definite social policy, they did not, of  course, make any attempt to break down the distinctions of rank; and  yet, in their own way, they endeavoured to teach all classes to respect  each other. They enjoined the barons to allow their servants to worship  with them round the family altar. They urged the rich to spend their  money on the poor instead of on dainties and fine clothes. They  forbade the poor to wear silk, urged them to be patient, cheerful and  industrious, and reminded them that in the better land their troubles  would vanish like dew before the rising sun. For the poorest of all,  those in actual need, they had special collections several times a year.  The fund was called the Korbona, and was managed by three officials. The  first kept the box, the second the key, the third the accounts. And the  rich and poor had all to bow to the same system of discipline. There  were three degrees of punishment. For the first offence the sinner was  privately admonished. For the second he was rebuked before the Elders,  and excluded from the Holy Communion until he repented. For the third he  was denounced in the Church before the whole congregation, and the  loud \"Amen\" of the assembled members proclaimed his banishment from the  Brethren's Church.    The system of government was Presbyterian. At the head of the whole  Brethren's Church was a board, called the \"Inner Council,\" elected by  the Synod. Next came the Bishops, elected also by the Synod. The supreme  authority was this General Synod. It consisted of all the ministers. As  long as the Inner Council held office they were, of course, empowered to  enforce their will; but the final court of appeal was the Synod, and by  the Synod all questions of doctrine and policy were settled.    The doctrine was simple and broad. As the Brethren never had a formal  creed, and never used their \"Confessions of Faith\" as tests, it may seem  a rather vain endeavour to inquire too closely into their theological  beliefs. And yet, on the other hand, we know enough to enable the  historian to paint a life-like picture. For us the important question  is, what did the Brethren teach their children? If we know what the  Brethren taught their children we know what they valued most; and this  we have set before us in the Catechism drawn up by Luke of Prague and  used as an authorised manual of instruction in the private homes of the  Brethren. It contained no fewer than seventy-six questions. The answers  are remarkably full, and therefore we may safely conclude that, though  it was not an exhaustive treatise, it gives us a wonderfully clear idea  of the doctrines which the Brethren prized most highly. It is remarkable  both for what it contains and for what it does not contain. It has no  distinct and definite reference to St. Paul's doctrine of justification  by faith. It is Johannine rather than Pauline in its tone. It contains  a great deal of the teaching of Christ and a very little of the teaching  of St. Paul. It has more to say about the Sermon on the Mount than about  any system of dogmatic theology. For one sentence out of St. Paul's  Epistles it has ten out of the Gospel of St. Matthew. As we read the  answers in this popular treatise, we are able to see in what way  the Brethren differed from the Lutheran Protestants in Germany. They  approached the whole subject of Christian life from a different point  of view. They were less dogmatic, less theological, less concerned about  accurate definition, and they used their theological terms in a broader  and freer way. For example, take their definition of faith. We all know  the definition given by Luther. \"There are,\" said Luther, \"two kinds of  believing: first, a believing about God which means that I believe that  what is said of God is true. This faith is rather a form of knowledge  than a faith. There is, secondly, a believing in God which means that I  put my trust in Him, give myself up to thinking that I can have dealings  with Him, and believe without any doubt that He will be and do to me  according to the things said of Him. Such faith, which throws itself  upon God, whether in life or in death, alone makes a Christian man.\" But  the Brethren gave the word faith a richer meaning. They made it signify  more than trust in God. They made it include both hope and love. They  made it include obedience to the Law of Christ.    \"What is faith in the Lord God?\" was one question in the Catechism.    \"It is to know God, to know His word; above all, to love Him, to do His  commandments, and to submit to His will.\"    \"What is faith in Christ?\"    \"It is to listen to His word, to know Him, to honour Him, to love Him  and to join the company of His followers.\"[31]  And this is the tone all through the Catechism and in all the early  writings of the Brethren. As a ship, said Luke, is not made of one  plank, so a Christian cannot live on one religious doctrine. The  Brethren had no pet doctrines whatever. They had none of the distinctive  marks of a sect. They taught their children the Apostles' Creed, the  Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Eight Beatitudes, and the  \"Six Commandments\" of the Sermon on the Mount. They taught the orthodox  Catholic doctrines of the Holy Trinity and the Virgin Birth. They held,  they said, the universal Christian faith. They enjoined the children to  honour, but not worship, the Virgin Mary and the Saints, and they  warned them against the adoration of pictures. If the Brethren had any  peculiarity at all, it was not any distinctive doctrine, but rather  their insistence on the practical duties of the believer. With Luther,  St. Paul's theology was foremost; with the Brethren (though not denied)  it fell into the background. With Luther the favourite court of appeal  was St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians; with the Brethren it was rather  the Sermon on the Mount and the tender Epistles of St. John.    Again the Brethren differed from Luther in their doctrine of the Lord's  Supper. As this subject was then the fruitful source of much discussion  and bloodshed, the Brethren at first endeavoured to avoid the issue at  stake by siding with neither of the two great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#14)"],[1,"attached shafts in all three stages have cushion  capitals. Under each of the large triforium arches are two smaller ones.  Though it has been said that there is no trace of any change of style  throughout the entire nave, yet it has been noticed that there is a  certain roughness about the execution of the arches towards the east  which is not seen further west. The floors of the nave and its aisles  are on one level; but till recently the floors of the aisles were a few  inches lower, and this is believed to have been the original  arrangement. The clerestory range has three arches, the central being  the highest.    [Illustration: PANELS IN THE NAVE CEILING.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    The western half of the #ceiling# was painted by Mr. Styleman le Strange,  of Hunstanton Hall, in Norfolk, between 1858 and 1861. He died in 1862.  The eastern half was then undertaken by Mr. Gambler Parry, of Highnam  Court, near Gloucester; and the main design of Mr. le Strange was  carried to a most successful issue. The original idea had been that a  Jesse tree should commence at the seventh bay, and the arrangement of  the subjects towards the west was meant to lead up to this. But Mr. le  Strange himself, as the work proceeded, realised that a grander effect  would be produced by introducing larger scriptural subjects towards the  east; and Mr. Gambier Parry accordingly acted upon what was known to be  the intention of the original designer. It has been many times said that  the whole design was suggested by the painted ceiling at Hildesheim, and  some words of Sir G. G. Scott have been quoted as proof of this; but Dean  Goodwin says that the scheme was not taken in any way from the foreign  example, and that Mr. le Strange had not seen the Hildesheim ceiling  when his design was formed.[2] It is worth noting that some of the  faces of the prophets are portraits; that of Isaiah, for instance, is a  portrait of Dean Peacock. The general tone of the colouring is  intentionally subdued, and the effect of this is said to be to increase  the apparent height of the nave.    The twelve subjects along the central portion of the ceiling, commencing  at the west, are these: (1) The Creation, (2) The Fall, (3) The  Sacrifice of Noah, (4) The Sacrifice of Isaac, (5) Jacob's Dream, (6)  The Marriage of Ruth, (7) Jesse, (8) David, (9) The Annunciation, (10)  The Nativity, (11) The Adoration of the Shepherds and of the Magi, (12)  The Lord in Glory.[3]    On the inner slope on each side of the central line for the ten western  bays are figures of patriarchs and prophets, each with a scroll bearing  some of his own words, all having prophetic reference to the Messiah. On  the outer slope on each side are heads in circular medallions, three in  each bay. \"The heads forming the border represent the human ancestors of  our Lord, according to the genealogy in S. Luke's Gospel; they commence  at the eastern end and terminate at the western, thus linking together  the Glorified Manhood, as exhibited in the last of the pictorial  representations, with the Creation of Man in the first.\"[4]    The sloping sides of the ceiling follow the course of the great beams  supporting the roof. Till it was resolved to construct this ceiling the  beams were exposed, and the whole was open to the leads. Canon Stewart  speaks of it as a \"remarkable example of a trussed rafter roof of seven  cants,\" and says that such a roof was sometimes called a compass roof.  He thinks it might have taken the place of an original roof of the  thirteenth century.    [Illustration: THE NORTH AISLE OF THE NAVE.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    #The Nave Aisles.#--These retain their groined roofs. Some remains of  coloured decoration may be seen in various places, especially in the  south aisle; and the appearance of more elaborate colouring at one place  seems to indicate that there was a side altar beneath. The rood-screen  in the nave was by the pier in which is a small canopied niche. In the  north aisle, beneath the windows, is an arcade of round-headed lancets,  four in each bay. Above the arcade was originally a string of chevron  moulding running along the whole length of the aisle; but this has been  hacked off, except beneath the most eastern window. In the south aisle  there are five such lancets in each bay west of the prior's door, and  four in each bay beyond. The windows east of this door are higher in the  wall than the others, because of the cloister, and the wall arcade is  correspondingly more lofty. The chevron moulding remains in this aisle  for seven bays, after which (until the last bay but one) the marks of it  are clearly to be seen. One of the windows in the south aisle is  original; all the rest, except one, have been recently made like it. In  the north aisle all the windows are of the Perpendicular period, and  have three lights under ogee arches. All are filled with stained glass.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH AISLE OF THE NAVE.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    In the south aisle is placed an ancient memorial stone of the greatest  interest. It consists of the square base and part of the shaft of a  cross. It was brought here from Haddenham, where it had been used as a  horse-block, by Mr. Bentham. On the base is this inscription:          LVCEM TVAM OVINO      DA DEVS ET REQVIE(M)              AMEN.    Ovin has been named in the account of the foundress as being her chief  agent, to whom was entrusted the civil government of her territory.  There is every reason to believe that this cross was erected either by  him or to his memory; and if so it must be twelve centuries old.    Just west of the monks' door is the entrance to the recently constructed  vestry for the choir-boys. This is thought to have been originally the  entrance to the cloister library or bookcase.    #The Octagon.#--Few visitors will perhaps be disposed to examine any  of the objects of interest in the cathedral before an inspection of the  beauties of this magnificent erection, the first sight of which, from  one of the smaller arches towards the aisles, is a thing never to be  forgotten. There is not one of the many able artists and architects who  have written about the octagon that has not spoken of it as being  without rival in the whole world; and the admiration that was expressed  fifty and more years ago would have been far greater, and the enthusiasm  more profound, had the writers seen it in its present state of perfect  restoration. No description can do adequate justice to the grandeur of  the conception or to the brilliancy of the execution of this renowned  work.    The four great arches rise to the full height of the roof; that to the  east, indeed, is higher than the vaulted roof of the choir and  presbytery, the intervening space being occupied with tracery of  wood-work on painted boards, the Saviour on the Cross being painted in  the middle. The wooden vaulting of the octagon springs from capitals on  the same level as those of the great arches. The four small arches to  the aisles are of course no higher than the roofs of the aisles: above  these, on each side, are three figures of apostles, under canopies with  crockets. The figures are seated, and each holds an emblem, by which it  can be seen for whom the figure is intended. It may be noticed (in the  central figure on the south-west side) that S. Paul, not S. Matthias,  is put in the place of Iscariot. The hood-moulds of the arches are  terminated by heads, of which six are portraits. King Edward III. and  Queen Philippa are at the north-east, Bishop Hotham and Prior Crauden at  the south-east, Walsingham and his master mason (so it is believed) at  the north-west; those to the south-west are mere grotesques. Above the  seated figures on each side is a window of four broad lights, filled  with stained glass. The eight chief vaulting shafts rise from the ground  as slight triple shafts; they support, a little above the spring of the  side arches, large corbels, which form bases for exquisitely designed  niches, and through these spring more shafts reaching to the vault. On  each of the corbels is a boldly carved scene from the career of S.  Etheldreda; they commence at the north-west arch. The subjects (two to  each arch) are as follows:    NORTH-WEST ARCH.--S. Etheldreda's second marriage. Her taking the veil  at Coldingham.    NORTH-EAST ARCH.--Her staff taking root. Her preservation in the flood  at S. Abb's Head.    SOUTH-EAST ARCH.--Her installation as Abbess of Ely, Her death and  burial (two scenes).    SOUTH-WEST ARCH.--One of her miracles. Her translation.    All these incidents have been sufficiently explained in the chapter on  the history of the building, with the exception of the seventh. The  authority for this is the \"Liber Eliensis.\" A man named Brytstan,[5]  being ill, had vowed that if he were restored to health he would become  a monk. Upon his taking steps to carry out this intention he was charged  with seeking refuge in a monastery simply to escape the consequences of  robberies of which he had been guilty in his business. After trial at  Huntingdon he was condemned and put in chains in prison in London. After  continuous prayers for the intercession of S. Etheldreda and S.  Benedict, these two saints appeared to him, and the latter drew the  links of the chain apart and set the prisoner free. The miracle came to  the knowledge of Matilda, Henry I.'s queen, and investigations  followed, which resulted in the release of Brytstan, and he was  conducted to Ely with manifestations of joy. Some have thought that the  ribands still to be bought at the stalls at the annual fair, and known  as \"S. Audrey's laces,\" are a reminiscence of this legend, and that they  represent the chains from which Brytstan was delivered. But the more  probable explanation is that they refer to the disease that afflicted S.  Etheldreda, a swelling in the neck, "]]]
