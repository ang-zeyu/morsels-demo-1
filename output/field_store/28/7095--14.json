[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22117"],[0,"Across Coveted Lands; or, a Journey from Flushing (Holland) to Calcutta Overland (#14)"],[1," away with, has  made this spot a sanctuary. Whoever remains within touch or even within  the shadow of the gun--whether an assassin, a thief, a bankrupt, an  incendiary, a traitor or a highwayman,--in fact, a criminal of any kind  cannot be touched by the police nor by persons seeking a personal  revenge--the usual way of settling differences in Persia. A number of  distinctly criminal types can always be observed near the gun and are fed  by relations, friends, or by charitable people. Persians of all classes  are extremely charitable, not so much for the sake of helping their  neighbours in distress, as for increasing their claims to a seat in  Paradise, according to the Mussulman religion.    These sanctuaries are common in Persia. The mosques, the principal  shrines, such as Meshed, Kum, the houses of Mullahs, and in many cases  the bazaars which are generally to be found adjoining places of  pilgrimage, afford most convenient shelter to outlaws. The Mullahs are  greatly responsible for the protection of miscreants. By exercising it  they are able to show their power over the authorities of the country--a  fact which impresses the masses. That is why in the neighbourhood of many  mosques one sees a great number of ruffianly faces, unmistakable  cut-throats, men and boys whose villainy is plainly stamped on their  countenances. As long as they remain inside the sacred precincts--which  they can do if they like till they die of old age--they can laugh at the  law and at the world at large. But let them come out, and they are done  for.    The Shah's stables are considered a very safe sanctuary. Houses of  Europeans, or Europeans themselves, were formerly considered sanctuaries,  but the habit has--fortunately for the residents--fallen into disuse. I  myself, when driving one day in the environs of Teheran, saw a horseman  leading a man whose neck was tied to a substantial rope. Much to my  surprise, when near enough, the prisoner jumped into my carriage, and it  was only after some persuasion on my side and a few pulls at the rope  from the rider at the other end that the unwelcome companion was made to  dismount again.    [Illustration: The Murderer of Nasr-ed-din Shah.]    When in the company of high Mullahs evil characters are also inviolable.    The largest square in Teheran is the Top Meidan or \"Cannon plain,\" where  several small and antiquated pieces of artillery are enclosed in a fence.  Two parallel avenues with trees cross the rectangular square at its  longest side from north to south. In the centre is a large covered  reservoir. The offices of both the Persian and Indo-European Telegraphs  are in this square, and also the very handsome building of the Bank of  Persia.    The square is quite imposing at first sight, having on two sides uniform  buildings with long balconies. The _lunettes_ of the archways underneath  have each a picture of a gun, and on approaching the southern gates of  the parallelogram a smile is provoked by the gigantic but crude, almost  childish representations of modern soldiers on glazed tiles. To the west  is the extensive drill ground for the Persian troops. Another  important artery of Teheran runs from east to west across the same  square.    One cannot but be interested on perceiving along the main thoroughfares  of Teheran a service of horse tramways working quite steadily. But the  rolling stock is not particularly inviting outwardly--much less inwardly.  It is mostly for the use of natives and Armenians, and the carriages are  very dirty. The horses, however, are good. The Tramway Company in the  hands of Russian Jews, I believe, but managed by an Englishman and  various foreigners--subalterns--was doing pretty fair business, and  jointly with the tramways had established a capital service of \"Voitures  de remise,\" which avoided all the trouble and unpleasantness of employing  street cabs. The carriages, mostly victorias, were quite good and clean.    Among other foreign things, Teheran can also boast of a railway--a mere  steam tramway, in reality--of very narrow gauge and extending for some  six miles south of the city to the shrine of Shah Abdul Hazim.    The construction of even so short and unimportant a line met with a great  deal of opposition, especially from the priestly class, when it was first  started in 1886 by a Belgian company--\"La Societe des Chemins de Fer et  des Tramways de Perse.\" The trains began to run two years later, in 1888,  and it was believed that the enormous crowds of pilgrims who daily  visited the holy shrine would avail themselves of the convenience. Huge  profits were expected, but unluckily the four or five engines that were  imported at an excessive cost, and the difficulties encountered in laying  down the line, which was continually being torn up by fanatics, and, most  of all, the difficulty experienced in inducing pilgrims to travel in  sufficient numbers by the line instead of on horses, mules or donkeys  were unexpected and insoluble problems which the managers had to face,  and which made the shareholders grumble. The expenses far exceeded the  profits, and the capital employed in the construction of the line was  already vastly larger than had been anticipated. One fine day,  furthermore, a much-envied and respected pilgrim, who had returned in  holiness from the famous shrine of Kerbalah, was unhappily run over and  killed by a train. The Mullahs made capital of this accident and preached  vengeance upon foreign importations, the work of the devil and  distasteful to Allah the great. The railway was mobbed and the engine and  carriages became a mass of debris.    There was nearly a serious riot about this in Teheran city; the trains  continued to run with the undamaged engines, but no one would travel by  them. Result? \"La Compagnie des Chemins de Fer et des Tramways de Perse\"  went bankrupt. The whole concern was eventually bought up cheap by a  Russian Company, and is now working again, as far as regards the railway,  in a more or less spasmodic manner.    The tramway service connects the three principal gates of the outer wall  of Teheran with the centre of the city \"the Place des Canons\"  (Meidan-Top-Khaned).    Although there are a great many mosques in Teheran city there is not one  of great importance or beauty. The Mesjid-i-shah, or the Shah's Mosque,  is the most noteworthy, and has a very decorative glazed tiled facade.  Then next in beauty is probably the mosque of the Shah's mother, but  neither is in any way uncommon for size, or wealth, architectural lines,  or sacredness. Several mosques have colleges attached to them, as is the  usual custom in Persia. Access to the interior of the mosques is not  permitted to Europeans unless they have embraced the Mahommedan religion.    Outwardly, there are few native houses in Teheran that impress one with  any remarkable features of wealth or beauty; in fact, they are nearly all  wretchedly miserable,--a plastered mud or brick wall with a modest little  doorway being all one sees from the street of the dwellings of even the  richest and noblest of Persians. Inside matters are different. Frequently  a miserable little tumbling-down gate gives access, after going through  similarly miserable, narrow, low passages, to magnificent palaces and  astoundingly beautiful and luxurious courts and gardens. I asked what was  the reason of the poor outward appearance of these otherwise luxurious  dwellings. Was it modesty,--was it to deceive envious eyes?    There are few countries where blackmail and extortion are carried on on a  more extensive and successful scale than in Persia; all classes and  conditions of people are exposed to the danger, and it is only by an  assumed air of poverty that a certain amount of security is obtained. A  miserable-looking house, it was explained by a Persian, does not attract  the covetous eye of the passer-by; an unusually beautiful one does. \"It  is a fatal mistake,\" he added, \"to let anybody's eye rest on one's  possessions, whether he be the Shah, a minister, or a beggar. He will  want to rest his hands upon them next, and then everything is gone.  Besides,\" he said, \"it is the inside of a house that gives pleasure and  comfort to the occupier and his friends. One does not build a house to  give pleasure and comfort to the people in the street. That is only  vainglory of persons who wish to make their neighbours jealous by outward  show. They usually have to repent it sooner or later.\"    There was more philosophy than European minds may conceive in the  Persian's words--at least, for Persian householders.          CHAPTER X         Legations--Germany a stumbling-block to Russia's and England's       supremacy--Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister in Teheran--His       talent, tact, and popularity--The British Legation--Summer       quarters--Legation guards--Removal of furniture.      As late as 1872 there were only four Legations in Teheran: the English,  French, Russian and Turkish; but since then the Governments of Austria,  Belgium, Holland, and the United States have established Legations in the  Persian capital. By the Persians themselves only four are considered of  first-class importance, viz.: the British, Russian, Turkish and Belgian  Legations, as being more closely allied with the interests of the  country. The Austrian Legation comes next to these in importance, then  the German.    American interests are so far almost a negligible quantity in Persia, but  Germany is attempting to force her trade into Persia. In future, if she  can realise her railway schemes in Asia Minor, Germany will be a very  serious stumbling-block to England's and Russia's supremacy, both in  North and Southern Persia. Germany's representative in Teheran is a man  of considerable skill and untiring energy. No doubt that when the  opportune time comes and Germany is ready to advance commercially in the  Persian market, England in particular will be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#14)"],[1,"lyptych.
