It served to prove that he who was small to  look at might yet have a considerable amount of bigness about him. I  used also to recite to her the scraps of poetry used as illustrations in  the chapter on prosody or rhetoric of our Bengali grammar. Now I  retailed at her evening gatherings the astronomical tit-bits I had  gleaned from Proctor.    My father's follower Kishori belonged at one time to a band of reciters  of Dasarathi's jingling versions of the Epics. While we were together in  the hills he often said to me: \"Oh, my little brother,[28] if I only had  had you in our troupe we could have got up a splendid performance.\" This  would open up to me a tempting picture of wandering as a minstrel boy  from place to place, reciting and singing. I learnt from him many of the  songs in his repertoire and these were in even greater request than my  talks about the photosphere of the Sun or the many moons of Saturn.    But the achievement of mine which appealed most to my mother was that  while the rest of the inmates of the inner apartments had to be content  with Krittivasa's Bengali rendering of the Ramayana, I had been reading  with my father the original of Maharshi Valmiki himself, Sanscrit metre  and all. \"Read me some of that Ramayana, _do_!\" she said, overjoyed at  this news which I had given her.    [Illustration: The Servant-maids in the Verandah]    Alas, my reading of Valmiki had been limited to the short extract from  his Ramayana given in my Sanskrit reader, and even that I had not  fully mastered. Moreover, on looking over it now, I found that my  memory had played me false and much of what I thought I knew had become  hazy. But I lacked the courage to plead \"I have forgotten\" to the eager  mother awaiting the display of her son's marvellous talents; so that, in  the reading I gave, a large divergence occurred between Valmiki's  intention and my explanation. That tender-hearted sage, from his seat in  heaven, must have forgiven the temerity of the boy seeking the glory of  his mother's approbation, but not so Madhusudan,[29] the taker down of  Pride.    My mother, unable to contain her feelings at my extraordinary exploit,  wanted all to share her admiration. \"You must read this to Dwijendra,\"  (my eldest brother), she said.    \"In for it!\" thought I, as I put forth all the excuses I could think of,  but my mother would have none of them. She sent for my brother  Dwijendra, and, as soon as he arrived, greeted him, with: \"Just hear  Rabi read Valmiki's Ramayan, how splendidly he does it.\"    It had to be done! But Madhusudan relented and let me off with just a  taste of his pride-reducing power. My brother must have been called away  while busy with some literary work of his own. He showed no anxiety to  hear me render the Sanscrit into Bengali, and as soon as I had read out  a few verses he simply remarked \"Very good\" and walked away.    After my promotion to the inner apartments I felt it all the more  difficult to resume my school life. I resorted to all manner of  subterfuges to escape the Bengal Academy. Then they tried putting me at  St. Xavier's. But the result was no better.    My elder brothers, after a few spasmodic efforts, gave up all hopes of  me--they even ceased to scold me. One day my eldest sister said: \"We had  all hoped Rabi would grow up to be a man, but he has disappointed us the  worst.\" I felt that my value in the social world was distinctly  depreciating; nevertheless I could not make up my mind to be tied to the  eternal grind of the school mill which, divorced as it was from all life  and beauty, seemed such a hideously cruel combination of hospital and  gaol.    One precious memory of St. Xavier's I still hold fresh and pure--the  memory of its teachers. Not that they were all of the same excellence.  In particular, in those who taught in our class I could discern no  reverential resignation of spirit. They were in nowise above the  teaching-machine variety of school masters. As it is, the educational  engine is remorselessly powerful; when to it is coupled the stone mill  of the outward forms of religion the heart of youth is crushed dry  indeed. This power-propelled grindstone type we had at St. Xavier's.  Yet, as I say, I possess a memory which elevates my impression of the  teachers there to an ideal plane.    This is the memory of Father DePeneranda. He had very little to do with  us--if I remember right he had only for a while taken the place of one  of the masters of our class. He was a Spaniard and seemed to have an  impediment in speaking English. It was perhaps for this reason that the  boys paid but little heed to what he was saying. It seemed to me that  this inattentiveness of his pupils hurt him, but he bore it meekly day  after day. I know not why, but my heart went out to him in sympathy. His  features were not handsome, but his countenance had for me a strange  attraction. Whenever I looked on him his spirit seemed to be in prayer,  a deep peace to pervade him within and without.    We had half-an-hour for writing our copybooks; that was a time when, pen  in hand, I used to become absent-minded and my thoughts wandered hither  and thither. One day Father DePeneranda was in charge of this class. He  was pacing up and down behind our benches. He must have noticed more  than once that my pen was not moving. All of a sudden he stopped behind  my seat. Bending over me he gently laid his hand on my shoulder and  tenderly inquired: \"Are you not well, Tagore?\" It was only a simple  question, but one I have never been able to forget.    I cannot speak for the other boys but I felt in him the presence of a  great soul, and even to-day the recollection of it seems to give me a  passport into the silent seclusion of the temple of God.    There was another old Father whom all the boys loved. This was Father  Henry. He taught in the higher classes; so I did not know him well. But  one thing about him I remember. He knew Bengali. He once asked Nirada, a  boy in his class, the derivation of his name. Poor Nirada[30] had so  long been supremely easy in mind about himself--the derivation of his  name, in particular, had never troubled him in the least; so that he was  utterly unprepared to answer this question. And yet, with so many  abstruse and unknown words in the dictionary, to be worsted by one's own  name would have been as ridiculous a mishap as getting run over by one's  own carriage, so Nirada unblushingly replied: \"_Ni_--privative,  _rode_--sun-rays; thence Nirode--that which causes an absence of the  sun's rays!\"          (17) _Home Studies_      Gyan Babu, son of Pandit Vedantavagish, was now our tutor at home. When  he found he could not secure my attention for the school course, he gave  up the attempt as hopeless and went on a different tack. He took me  through Kalidas's \"Birth of the War-god,\" translating it to me as we  went on. He also read Macbeth to me, first explaining the text in  Bengali, and then confining me to the school room till I had rendered  the day's reading into Bengali verse. In this way he got me to translate  the whole play. I was fortunate enough to lose this translation and so  am relieved to that extent of the burden of my _karma_.    It was Pandit Ramsarvaswa's duty to see to the progress of our Sanskrit.  He likewise gave up the fruitless task of teaching grammar to his  unwilling pupil, and read Sakuntala with me instead. One day he took it  into his head to show my translation of Macbeth to Pandit Vidyasagar and  took me over to his house.    Rajkrishna Mukherji had called at the time and was seated with him. My  heart went pit-a-pat as I entered the great Pandit's study, packed full  of books; nor did his austere visage assist in reviving my courage.  Nevertheless, as this was the first time I had had such a distinguished  audience, my desire to win renown was strong within me. I returned home,  I believe, with some reason for an access of enthusiasm. As for  Rajkrishna Babu, he contented himself with admonishing me to be careful  to keep the language and metre of the Witches' parts different from that  of the human characters.    During my boyhood Bengali literature was meagre in body, and I think I  must have finished all the readable and unreadable books that there were  at the time. Juvenile literature in those days had not evolved a  distinct type of its own--but that I am sure did me no harm. The watery  stuff into which literary nectar is now diluted for being served up to  the young takes full account of their childishness, but none of them as  growing human beings. Children's books should be such as can partly be  understood by them and partly not. In our childhood we read every  available book from one end to the other; and both what we understood,  and what we did not, went on working within us. That is how the world  itself reacts on the child consciousness. The child makes its own what  it understands, while that which is beyond leads it on a step forward.    When Dinabandhu Mitra's satires came out I was not of an age for which  they were suitable. A kinswoman of ours was reading a copy, but no  entreaties of mine could induce her to lend it to me. She used to keep  it under lock and key. Its inaccessibility made me want it all the more  and I threw out the challenge that read the book I must and would.    One afternoon she was playing cards, and her keys, tied to a corner of  her _sari_, hung over her shoulder. I had never paid any attention to  cards, in fact I could not stand card games. But my behaviour that day  would hardly have borne this out, so engrossed was I in their playing.  At last, in the excitement of one side being about to make a score, I  seized my opportunity and set about untying the knot which held the  keys. I was not skilful, and moreover excited and hasty and so got  caught."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#14)"],[1,"see a big battle; at least we shall if the French don't  run away. See! there is a twelve-oared boat starting from the admiral's  ship and rowing right away. They must be going to Alexandria. They are  rowing hard, too.\"    They watched it for some time, and then returned to their tent. Two  hours later a number of ships' boats were seen coming out from  Alexandria.    \"They are men-of-war boats,\" Edgar said. \"I think I must have been  right, and that that vessel we saw must have been an English frigate.  That boat has been sent to order all the sailors we saw in the streets  of the town to return at once.\"    For some hours boats continued to pass, all filled with men, but there  were no signs of movement on the part of the ships.    \"If it was one of our frigates the French admiral must have made up his  mind to fight them. They have got a great advantage, covered as they are  by those two land batteries. Besides, I know that there is a spit of  sand running out there which will make it very awkward for an enemy, not  knowing its position, to attack them. There is one thing, the French  will find it difficult to sail out if they want to. You see the wind is  on shore, and they are all riding head to it. There can't be much water  inside them. No doubt they could get out all right if they had plenty of  time and no one to interfere with them, but it would be a difficult  business to manage if the British fleet were upon them.\"    At ten o'clock the next morning a number of large vessels were seen in  the distance. They bore down towards Alexandria, but the wind was light  and they made but slow way, and it was five in the afternoon before,  having changed their course, they formed into line of battle and headed  for the French fleet. The scene from the shore was intensely exciting.  In each fleet there were thirteen battle-ships, but the French ships  were the larger and more heavily armed. They carried forty-six more  guns, and the weight of their broadside was 14,029 pounds to 10,695  pounds, while they carried 2300 more men, and were 5000 tons heavier.  They had, too, in addition, four frigates, besides the mortar vessels,  gun-boats, and the battery on the island of Aboukir. Soon after six  o'clock, the two leading vessels of the British fleet being within  range, the French opened fire, as did the guns of the battery. Edgar  uttered an exclamation of disgust as one of the largest of the English  ships was seen to stop suddenly in her course.    \"She has run on the shoal!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, our ships are steering  for the head of the French line; they mean to go inside them.\"    As the British vessels reached the head of the French ships they  anchored one after another, each laying itself broadside to broadside  against an opponent, and the battle commenced with terrible energy, the  tremendous roar of the guns astounding the Arabs who were gathered on  the sand-hills. At first the French reply was feeble. They were taken  entirely by surprise by Nelson's manoeuvre. Believing that he could  only attack them from outside, they had prepared only on that hand for  the fight, and in clearing the decks for action all the useless gear and  fittings had been piled over on the other side, and it was some little  time before this could be cleared away and the guns got ready for  action. Then for a time their fire was as heavy as that of the British.  Nevertheless some of them had suffered terribly before they were able to  return a shot, and this contributed in no small degree to the British  victory.    The loss of the _Culloden_, which was the vessel which struck on the  sands, and of the _Leander_, which went to her assistance, was serious,  and had the French rear-admiral, Villeneuve, who commanded the five  vessels at the rear of the French line, cut his cables and come to the  assistance of his comrades, the eight British ships, engaged with as  many French, would have been in a serious position. He did not do so,  however, possibly fearing to run his ships aground. Consequently the  _Alexandria_ and the _Swiftsure_ came in to the assistance of the  British ships, some of which were being terribly damaged by the greatly  superior weight of the French fire. The _Bellerophon_, dismasted and  disabled by the enemy's fire, dropped out of the line, and the  _Alexandria_ took her place, while the _Swiftsure_ attacked the  _Franklin_. The _Leander_, seeing how hard was the fight, relinquished  her attempt to get the _Culloden_ afloat, and, sailing in, engaged in  the battle.    [Illustration: Battle of THE NILE    1st. August 1798.]    For a time the issue was doubtful. The three English seventy-four-gun  ships were matched against one of a hundred and twenty and two of  eighty-four. Darkness did not put a stop to the engagement, which  continued to rage with unabated fury, the battle being practically  between twelve British ships and eight French ships of the line and  their four frigates and gun-boats. By ten o'clock five of the French van  had surrendered, and the great hundred-and-twenty-gun ship, the  _Orient_, was in flames. The excitement of the Arabs as the battle  continued was unbounded. It seemed to them that mortal men could not  sustain so terrible a conflict, and exclamations of wonder and  admiration rose constantly among them.    The light of the burning vessel enabled the whole of the terrible scene  to be clearly witnessed. Half the ships were partly or wholly dismasted,  the rigging was cut to pieces, and the sails were riddled with balls.  The splintered sides, bulwarks shot away, and port-holes blown into one,  showed how terrible was the damage inflicted on both sides. Higher and  higher rose the flames on board the _Orient_. Men could be seen leaping  overboard into the water from the burning ship, and soon after ten she  blew up with a tremendous explosion, the concussion of which was so  great that many of the Arabs were thrown to the ground. For ten minutes  a dead silence succeeded the roar of battle, not a gun was fired on  either side. The British vessels near the spot where the _Orient_ had  lately floated lowered what boats there were uninjured and set to work  to rescue the survivors, who were either clinging to spars or were  swimming. Several of these, too, were hauled in at the lower port-holes  of the ships.    The French ship _Franklin_ was the first to recommence firing, but after  a few more broadsides from the _Swiftsure_ she hauled down her colours.  The firing continued without any abatement until three o'clock in the  morning. It then died away for a time, but recommenced at six o'clock  with fresh fury, and it was not until two in the afternoon that it came  to an end. Villeneuve, seeing that all was lost, now woke up and cut his  cables. Three of his ships ran aground, but with the _Guillaume Tell_  and the _Genereux_ and two frigates he made off, there being only one  British ship that was in condition to make sail in pursuit. The two  line-of-battle ships and one of the frigates were afterwards captured by  a British squadron.    Thus of the thirteen French ships of the line eight had surrendered, one  had blown up, two had escaped, and two were on shore. If the _Culloden_  could have got into action, it is probable that not one of the French  fleet would have left Aboukir Bay. The British loss in killed and  wounded was 895. 3105 of the French, including the wounded, were  captured, and 5225 perished in the fight. The victory was the most  decisive that was ever won at sea.          CHAPTER V.    A STREET ATTACK.      Not until the last gun was fired did Edgar and his Arab friend return to  their tent, utterly worn out by excitement and watching.    \"I told you what it would be, Sidi,\" Edgar said as they went along. \"I  was certain that we should thrash them. It is a tremendous victory, and  you see it is as important for you as it is for us, for the French army  is now cut off. It will be a long time indeed before the French can fit  out another fleet strong enough to have even a chance of fighting ours,  and, as far as I can see, the only possible escape for their army is to  march all the way round by Syria to Constantinople, and I should think  that after this the Sultan will at once declare war with them, for by  conquering Egypt they have taken one of his provinces.\"    This turned out to be the case. The news of the capture of Egypt had  filled the Sultan with indignation and rage, but the fear excited by  the success of the French arms in Europe deterred him from declaring war  against so formidable a foe until the report of the destruction of their  fleet reached Constantinople, when he at once plucked up courage,  declared war against France, and ordered two armies to be gathered for  the reconquest of Egypt. The news of the destruction of the French fleet  caused intense excitement throughout Egypt. It showed that the French  were not, as many had been inclined to consider them, invincible, and  that it was improbable they would be able to receive any reinforcements  from beyond the sea.    A week previously the Arabs had felt completely crushed, now the feeling  of independence and hope sprang up again, and the whole situation was at  once changed. Sidi had, directly the fight came to an end, sent off one  of his followers to meet his father, and to inform him of what had taken  place. Four days later the man returned; he had met the chief and his  party just as they had reached the river. The latter had resolved at  once to rejoin the desert tribesmen, and to escort the caravan back to  their oasis; his wife, the women, and the animals were to remain there.  The party now at the encampment with Sidi were to join him at once.    \"The sheik bids me say,\" the messenger went on to Sidi, \"that he would  that you should not wait until the others are ready to start, but, if he  is willing, should at once ride with your white friend to Cairo, if he"]]]
