His voice loud, sonorous, and as rolling thunder in the distance,      augmented the effect of his fierce and terrible invective. Few      indeed were they who did not quail before his frown; fewer still      who would abide his onset in debate. Perhaps no modern English      statesman, in the House of Lords at least, was ever so much      dreaded. In parliament, as at the bar, his speeches were home      thrusts, conveying the strongest arguments or keenest reproofs in      the plainest and clearest words. His enemies might accuse his      style of being coarse, and sometimes even ungrammatical, but they      could never deny its energy or its effect. In private life Thurlow      was remarkable for his thorough knowledge of the Greek and Latin      writers; and no less for his skill in argument and brilliant      powers of conversation. While yet at the bar, Dr. Johnson said of      him to Boswell: \"I honor Thurlow, sir; Thurlow is a fine fellow;      he fairly puts his mind to yours.\" And after he became Chancellor,      the same high authority added: \"I would prepare myself for no man      in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am to meet him, I should wish      to know a day before.\" Unless with ladies, his manner was always      uncouth, and his voice a constant growl. But beneath that rugged      rind there appears to have lurked much warmth of affection and      kindliness of heart. Many acts of generous aid and unsolicited      bounty are recorded of him. Men of learning and merit seldom      needed any other recommendation to his favor. Thus, on reading      Horsley's \"Letters to Dr. Priestly,\" he at once obtained for the      author a stall at Gloucester, saying--what I earnestly wish all      other Chancellors had borne in mind--\"that those who supported the      Church should be supported by it.\" Nevertheless his temper, even      when in some measure sobered down by age, was always liable to      violent and unreasonable starts of passion. It is related by a      gentleman who dined with him at Brighton only a few months before      his death--for I must ever hold that great characters are best      portrayed by little circumstances--that a plateful of peaches being      brought in, the ex-Chancellor, incensed at their ill appearance,      ordered the window to be opened, and not only the peaches but the      whole desert to be thrown out!                                    EDMUND BURKE.        In pamphlets, however, and political essays--and even speeches,      when revised and sent forth singly, may be comprehended in that      class,--the personal disadvantages of Burke could no longer apply;      and as regards that class of writings, it may be doubted whether      he has ever, in any age, or in any country, been excelled. The      philosophy and deep thought of his reflections--the vigor and      variety of his style--his rich flow of either panegyric or      invective--his fine touches of irony--the glowing abundance and      beauty of his metaphors--all these might separately claim applause;      how much more, then, when all blended into one glorious whole! To      give examples of these merits would be to transcribe half his      works. Yet still if one single and short instance from his maxims      be allowed me, I will observe that the generous ardor and activity      of mind called forth by competition has formed a theme of      philosophic comment from a very early age. It is touched both by      Cicero and Quintilian; it has not been neglected either by Bacon      or Montaigne. Yet still, as handled by Burke, this trite topic      beams forth, not only with the hues of eloquence, but even with      the bloom of novelty. He invites us to \"an amicable conflict with      difficulty. Difficulty is a severe instructor set over us by the      supreme ordinance of a parental guardian and legislator, who knows      us better than we know ourselves, as he loves us better too. He      that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our      skill. Our antagonist is our helper!\" If amidst so much of      eloquence and feeling as Burke's writings display we are desired      to seek for faults, we shall find them, not in the want, but only      in the exuberance and overflow of beauties. The palate becomes      cloyed by so much richness, the eye dazzled by so much glare. His      metaphors, fraught with fancy though they be, are often bold; they      seem both too numerous and strained too far; they sometimes cease      to please, and occasionally border even on the ludicrous and low.      Of this defect, as of his excellences, a single instance shall      suffice me. In the \"Letter to a Noble Lord,\" in 1796, Burk      compares the Duke of Bedford to a lamb already marked for      slaughter by the Marats and Robespierres of France, but still      unconscious of his doom, \"pleased to the last,\" and who \"licks the      hand just raised to shed his blood.\" Thus far the simile is      conducted with admirable force and humor. But not satisfied with      his success, Burke goes further; he insists on leading us into the      shambles, and makes the revolutionary butchers inquire as to their      ducal victim, \"how he cuts up? how he tallows in the caul or on      the kidneys?\" Apart from the beauty of the style, the value, as I      conceive, of Burke's writings, is subject to one not unimportant      deduction. For most lofty and far-sighted views in politics they      will never be consulted in vain. On the other hand, let no man      expect to find in them just or accurate, or even consistent,      delineations of contemporary character. Where eternal principles      are at stake, Burke was inaccessible to favor or to fear. Where      only persons are concerned, he was often misled by resentments or      by partialities, and allowed his fancy full play. The rich stores      of Burke's memory and the rare powers of his mind were not      reserved solely for his speeches or his writings; they appeared to      no less advantage in his familiar conversation. Even the most      trivial topics could elicit, even the most ignorant hearers could      discern, his genius. \"Sir,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"if Burke were to go      into a stable to see his horse dressed, the hostler would say, We      have had an extraordinary man here!\" On other occasions, also, the      author of \"Rasselas\" extols him as \"never unwilling to begin      conversation, never at a loss to carry it on, never in haste to      leave it off.\" His attempts at wit, indeed, were not always      successful, and he might be accused of an inordinate affection for      quibbles and puns. His favorite niece, and latterly his guest, was      sometimes provoked into a--\"Really, uncle, that is very poor.\" But      upon the whole it may be asserted, that in social converse Burke      was equalled by none of his contemporaries and his countrymen,      except only Dr. Johnson himself and perhaps Lord Thurlow.      We have no more room for further extracts; those we have made illustrate  the temper and the style of the work, and will commend it to the favorable  consideration of American readers. Among subjects treated most elaborately  is that of the authorship of Junius; but Lord Mahon has no new facts for  the vindication of his judgment, that Sir Philip Francis was  unquestionably the writer of the famous letters under that name.    There is an appendix to each volume; and in the appendix of one, and in  the notes of both, are some curious illustrations of the worthlessness of  Mr. Sparks's editions of the writings of Washington and Franklin. We first  called attention to this subject some five years ago, and after the  changes, &c. of Mr. Sparks had been pointed out in _The International_, a  series of carefully prepared criticisms appeared in the _Evening Post_, in  which the discrepancies between the original letters of Washington were  exhibited to a degree that at once and for ever destroyed the good  reputation of Mr. Sparks in this department. He chose not to take any  notice of the disclosures to which we refer, but it may be that Lord  Mahon's criticism will secure his attention, and an attempt, at least, for  his vindication. Besides his comparisons of MS. and printed letters in the  appendix, Lord Mahon has several allusions to the subject, of which we  quote specimens:          \"Some samples of the manner in which that gentleman (Mr. Sparks)      has thought himself at liberty to tamper with the original MSS.,      will be found,\" &c.        \"Mr. Sparks has printed no part of the correspondence precisely as      Washington wrote it, but has greatly altered, and as he thinks,      corrected and embellished it. Such a liberty with the writings of      such a man might be justifiable, nay, even in some respects      necessary, if Washington and his principal contemporaries had been      still alive; but the date of this publication, the year (1838),      leaves, as I conceive, no adequate vindication for _tampering with      the truth of history_.\"        \"Washington, however, in his public letter to Congress (unless Mr.      Jared Sparks has _improved_ this passage), says,\" &c.        \"I know not whether my readers will concur with me in liking      Washington's own and though home-spun, excellent cloth, much      better than the 'Cobweb schemes and gauze coverings' which have,      it seems, been manufactured in its place.\"      A complete errata to Mr. Sparks's editions of Washington, Franklin, and  Gouverneur Morris, would occupy several volumes; and we do not remember  one instance in which his alterations were justifiable, or in which they  were really an improvement in point of style. The reprobation with which  Mr. Sparks has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#14)"],[1,"see  who did the deed, the Indian thinks it by no means necessary to fix on  anyone who has been with or near the injured man. The _kenaima_ is  supposed to have done the deed, not necessarily in person, but probably  in spirit.\"[14] For these Indians believe that each individual man has a  body and a spirit within it, and that sorcerers can despatch their  spirits out of their bodies to harm people at a distance. It is not  always in an invisible form that these spirits of sorcerers are supposed  to roam on their errands of mischief. The wizard can put his spirit into  the shape of an animal, such as a jaguar, a serpent, a sting-ray, a  bird, an insect, or anything else he pleases. Hence when an Indian is  attacked by a wild beast, he thinks that his real foe is not the animal,  but the sorcerer who has transformed himself into it. Curiously enough  they look upon some small harmless birds in the same light. One little  bird, in particular, which flits across the savannahs with a peculiar  shrill whistle at morning and evening, is regarded by the Indians with  especial fear as a transformed sorcerer. They think that for every one  of these birds that they shoot they have an enemy the less, and they  burn its little body, taking great care that not even a single feather  escapes to be blown about by the wind. On a windy day a dozen men and  women have been seen chasing the floating feathers of these birds about  the savannah in order utterly to extinguish the imaginary wizard. Even  the foreign substance, the stick, bone, or whatever it is, which the  good medicine-man pretends to suck from the body of the sufferer \"is  often, if not always, regarded not simply as a natural body, but as the  materialised form of a hostile spirit.\"[15]    [Sidenote: Belief of the Tinneh Indians in sorcery as the cause of  death.]    Beliefs and practices of the same general character are reported to have  formerly prevailed among the Tinneh or Dene Indians of North-west  America. When any beloved or influential person died, nobody, we are  told, would think of attributing the death to natural causes; it was  assumed that the demise was an effect of sorcery, and the only  difficulty was to ascertain the culprit. For that purpose the services  of a shaman were employed. Rigged out in all his finery he would dance  and sing, then suddenly fall down and feign death or sleep. On awaking  from the apparent trance he would denounce the sorcerer who had killed  the deceased by his magic art, and the denunciation generally proved the  death-warrant of the accused.[16]    [Sidenote: Belief of the Australian aborigines in sorcery as the cause  of death.]    Again, similar beliefs and customs in regard to what we should call  natural death appear to have prevailed universally amongst the  aborigines of Australia, and to have contributed very materially to thin  the population. On this subject I will quote the words of an observer.  His remarks apply to the Australian aborigines in general but to the  tribes of Victoria in particular. He says: \"The natives are much more  numerous in some parts of Australia than they are in others, but nowhere  is the country thickly peopled; some dire disease occasionally breaks  out among the natives, and carries off large numbers.... But there are  two other causes which, in my opinion, principally account for their  paucity of numbers. The first is that infanticide is universally  practised; the second, that a belief exists that no one can die a  natural death. Thus, if an individual of a certain tribe dies, his  relatives consider that his death has been caused by sorcery on the part  of another tribe. The deceased's sons, or nearest relatives, therefore  start off on a _bucceening_ or murdering expedition. If the deceased is  buried, a fly or a beetle is put into the grave, and the direction in  which the insect wings its way when released is the one the avengers  take. If the body is burnt, the whereabouts of the offending parties is  indicated by the direction of the smoke. The first unfortunates fallen  in with are generally watched until they encamp for the night; when they  are buried in sleep, the murderers steal quietly up until they are  within a yard or two of their victims, rush suddenly upon and butcher  them. On these occasions they always abstract the kidney-fat, and also  take off a piece of the skin of the thigh. These are carried home as  trophies, as the American Indians take the scalp. The murderers anoint  their bodies with the fat of their victims, thinking that by that  process the strength of the deceased enters into them. Sometimes it  happens that the _bucceening_ party come suddenly upon a man of a  strange tribe in a tree hunting opossums; he is immediately speared, and  left weltering in his blood at the foot of the tree. The relatives of  the murdered man at once proceed to retaliate; and thus a constant and  never-ending series of murders is always going on.... I do not mean to  assert that for every man that dies or is killed another is murdered;  for it often happens that the deceased has no sons or relatives who care  about avenging his death. At other times a _bucceening_ party will  return without having met with any one; then, again, they are sometimes  repelled by those they attack.\"[17]    [Sidenote: Belief of the natives of Western Australia in sorcery as a  cause of death. Beliefs of the tribes of Victoria and South Australia.]    Again, speaking of the tribes of Western Australia, Sir George Grey  tells us that \"the natives do not allow that there is such a thing as a  death from natural causes; they believe, that were it not for murderers  or the malignity of sorcerers, they might live for ever; hence, when a  native dies from the effect of an accident, or from some natural cause,  they use a variety of superstitious ceremonies, to ascertain in what  direction the sorcerer lives, whose evil practices have brought about  the death of their relative; this point being satisfactorily settled by  friendly sorcerers, they then attach the crime to some individual, and  the funeral obsequies are scarcely concluded, ere they start to revenge  their supposed wrongs.\"[18] Again, speaking of the Watch-an-die tribe of  Western Australia, another writer tells us that they \"possess the  comfortable assurance that nearly all diseases, and consequently deaths,  are caused by the enchantments of hostile tribes, and that were it not  for the malevolence of their enemies they would (with a few exceptions)  live for ever. Consequently, on the first approach of sickness their  first endeavour is to ascertain whether the _boollia_ [magic] of their  own tribe is not sufficiently potent to counteract that of their foes.  Should the patient recover, they are, of course, proud of the  superiority of their enchantment over that of their enemies: but should  the _boollia_ [magical influence] within the sick man prove stronger  than their own, as there is no help for it, he must die, the utmost they  can do in this case is to revenge his death.\"[19] But the same writer  qualifies this general statement as follows: \"It is not true,\" he says,  \"that the New Hollanders impute _all_ natural deaths to the _boollia_  [magic] of inimical tribes, for in most cases of persons wasting visibly  away before death, they do not entertain the notion. It is chiefly in  cases of sudden death, or when the body of the deceased is fat and in  good condition, that this belief prevails, and it is only in such  contingencies that it becomes an imperative duty to have revenge.\"[20]  Similarly, speaking of the tribes of Victoria in the early days of  European settlement among them, the experienced observer Mr. James  Dawson says that \"natural deaths are generally--but not  always--attributed to the malevolence and the spells of an enemy  belonging to another tribe.\"[21] Again, with regard to the Encounter Bay  tribe of South Australia we read that \"there are but few diseases which  they regard as the consequences of natural causes; in general they  consider them the effects of enchantment, and produced by  sorcerers.\"[22] Similarly of the Port Lincoln tribes in South Australia  it is recorded that \"in all cases of death that do not arise from old  age, wounds, or other equally palpable causes, the natives suspect that  unfair means have been practised; and even where the cause of death is  sufficiently plain, they sometimes will not content themselves with it,  but have recourse to an imaginary one, as the following case will  prove:--A woman had been bitten by a black snake, across the thumb, in  clearing out a well; she began to swell directly, and was a corpse in  twenty-four hours; yet, another woman who had been present when the  accident occurred, stated that the deceased had named a certain native  as having caused her death. Upon this statement, which was in their  opinion corroborated by the circumstance that the snake had drawn no  blood from the deceased, her husband and other friends had a fight with  the accused party and his friends; a reconciliation, however, took place  afterwards, and it was admitted on the part of the aggressors that they  had been in error with regard to the guilty individual; but nowise more  satisfied as to the bite of the snake being the true cause of the  woman's death, another party was now suddenly discovered to be the real  offender, and accordingly war was made upon him and his partisans, till  at last the matter was dropped and forgotten. From this case, as well as  from frequent occurrences of a similar nature, it appears evident that  thirst for revenge has quite as great a share in these foul accusations  as superstition.\"[23]    [Sidenote: Other testimonies as to the belief of the natives of South  Australia and Victoria.]    However, other experienced observers of the Australian aborigines admit  no such limitations and exceptions to the native theory that death"]]]
