Ned will be up tonight  first thing, of course, and I'll introduce him. Try to keep the poor  fellow amused until I get back. Two months! Just fancy! And Aunt  Elizabeth won't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay  with her. Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull, too.\"    Then the talk drifted around to Edith's affairs. She was engaged to a  certain Sidney Keith, who was a professor in some college.    \"I don't expect to see much of Sidney this summer,\" said Edith. \"He's  writing another book. He is so terribly addicted to literature.\"    \"How lovely,\" sighed Katherine, who had aspirations in that line  herself. \"If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy. But  Ned is so prosaic. He doesn't care a rap for poetry, and he laughs  when I enthuse. It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up  writing seriously. He says women writers are an abomination on the  face of the earth. Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous?\"    \"He is very handsome, though,\" said Edith, with a glance at his  photograph on Katherine's dressing table. \"And that is what Sid is  not. He is rather distinguished looking, but as plain as he can  possibly be.\"    Edith sighed. She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it  rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover.    \"He has lovely eyes,\" said Katherine comfortingly, \"and handsome men  are always vain. Even Ned is. I have to snub him regularly. But I  think you'll like him.\"    Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night. He was a  handsome off-handed young fellow, who seemed to admire Katherine  immensely, and be a little afraid of her into the bargain.    \"Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away,\"  she told him in their good-bye chat. \"She is a dear girl--you'll like  her, I know. It's really too bad I have to go away now, but it can't  be helped.\"    \"I shall be awfully lonesome,\" grumbled Ned. \"Don't you forget to  write regularly, Kitty.\"    \"Of course I'll write, but for pity's sake, Ned, don't call me Kitty.  It sounds so childish. Well, bye-bye, dear boy. I'll be back in two  months and then we'll have a lovely time.\"           *       *       *       *       *    When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how  upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven. Harbour Hill  was noted for its beauty, but not every woman can live by scenery  alone.    \"Aunt Elizabeth,\" said Katherine one day, \"does anybody ever die in  Harbour Hill? Because it doesn't seem to me it would be any change for  them if they did.\"    Aunt Elizabeth's only reply to this was a shocked look.    To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds, and this  involved long tramps along the shore. On one of these occasions she  met with an adventure. The place was a remote spot far up the shore.  Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings, tucked up her skirt,  rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows, and was deep in the  absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland. She  looked anything but dignified while so employed, but under the  circumstances dignity did not matter.    Presently she heard a shout from the shore and, turning around in  dismay, she beheld a man on the rocks behind her. He was evidently  shouting at her. What on earth could the creature want?    \"Come in,\" he called, gesticulating wildly. \"You'll be in the  bottomless pit in another moment if you don't look out.\"    \"He certainly must be a lunatic,\" said Katherine to herself, \"or else  he's drunk. What am I to do?\"    \"Come in, I tell you,\" insisted the stranger. \"What in the world do  you mean by wading out to such a place? Why, it's madness.\"    Katherine's indignation got the better of her fear.    \"I do not think I am trespassing,\" she called back as icily as  possible.    The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all. He came down to the  very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly. He was  dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles. He did  not look like a lunatic, and he did not seem to be drunk.    \"I implore you to come in,\" he said earnestly. \"You must be standing  on the very brink of the bottomless pit.\"    He is certainly off his balance, thought Katherine. He must be some  revivalist who has gone insane on one point. I suppose I'd better go  in. He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I don't.    She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens. The  stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks.    \"I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in  that fashion for a handful of seaweeds,\" he said.    \"I haven't the faintest idea what you mean,\" said Miss Rangely. \"You  don't look crazy, but you talk as if you were.\"    \"Do you mean to say you don't know that what the people hereabouts  call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point--the most  dangerous spot along the whole coast?\"    \"No, I didn't,\" said Katherine, horrified. She remembered now that  Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along  shore, but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it  to be in quite another direction. \"I am a stranger here.\"    \"Well, I hardly thought you'd be foolish enough to be out there if you  knew,\" said the other in mollified accents. \"The place ought not to be  left without warning, anyhow. It is the most careless thing I ever  heard of. There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever  been able to find the bottom of it. A person who got into it would  never be heard of again. The rocks there form an eddy that sucks  everything right down.\"    \"I am very grateful to you for calling me in,\" said Katherine humbly.  \"I had no idea I was in such danger.\"    \"You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds, I see,\" said the unknown.    But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds. She suddenly  realized what she must look like--bare feet, draggled skirts, dripping  arms. And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was  undoubtedly a gentleman. Oh, if he would only go and give her a chance  to put on her shoes and stockings!    Nothing seemed further from his intentions. When Katherine had picked  up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward, he walked beside her,  still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly  accustomed to walking with barefooted young women. In spite of  herself, Katherine couldn't help listening to him, for he managed to  invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest. She finally decided that  as he didn't seem to mind her bare feet, she wouldn't either.    He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly  amateurish beside him. He looked over her specimens and pointed out  the valuable ones. He explained the best method of preserving and  mounting them, and told her of other and less dangerous places along  the shore where she might get some new varieties.    When they came in sight of Harbour Hill, Katherine began to wonder  what on earth she would do with him. It wasn't exactly permissible to  snub a man who had practically saved your life, but, on the other  hand, the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour  Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman  discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated.    The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself. He said that he must really  go back or he would be late for dinner, lifted his hat politely, and  departed. Katherine waited until he was out of sight, then sat down on  the sand and put on her shoes and stockings.    \"Who on earth can he be?\" she said to herself. \"And where have I seen  him before? There was certainly something familiar about his  appearance. He is very nice, but he must have thought me crazy. I  wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill.\"    The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith  awaiting her.    \"I see Ned quite often,\" wrote the latter, \"and I think he is  perfectly splendid. You are a lucky girl, Kate. But oh, do you know  that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill, too, or at least quite near  it? I had a letter from him yesterday. He has gone down there to spend  his vacation, because it is so quiet, and to finish up some horrid  scientific book he is working at. He's boarding at some little  farmhouse up the shore. I've written to him today to hunt you up and  consider himself introduced to you. I think you'll like him, for he's  just your style.\"    Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith's card was brought up to her that  evening and went down to meet him. Her companion of the morning rose  to meet her.    \"You!\" he said.    \"Yes, me,\" said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically. \"You  didn't expect it, did you? I was sure I had seen you before--only it  wasn't you but your photograph.\"    When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to  call again. He did not fail to avail himself of it--in fact, he became  a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa. Katherine wrote all about it to  Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience.    They got on capitally together. They went on long expeditions up shore  after seaweeds, and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a  collection of the Harbour Hill flora. This involved more long,  companionable expeditions. Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor  Keith found time to work on his book, but as he made no reference to  the subject, neither did she.    Once in a while, when she had time to think of them, she wondered how  Ned and Edith were getting on. At first Edith's letters had been full  of Ned, but in her last two or three she had said little about him.  Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled.  Edith wrote back and said, \"What nonsense.\" She and Ned were as good  friends as ever, but he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#14)"],[1,"go.  You're too young to be married, but if you let him go off to South  Africa he'll slip through your fingers for sure, and I s'pose you're  like some of the rest of us--nobody'll do you but the one. So tell him  to come here and be married.\"    \"I don't see how I can,\" I gasped. \"I can't get ready to be married in  three weeks. I can't--\"    \"I should think you have enough clothes in that trunk to do you for a  spell,\" said Aunt Philippa sarcastically. \"You've more than my mother  ever had in all her life. We'll get you a wedding dress of some kind.  You can get it made in Charlottetown, if country dressmakers aren't  good enough for you, and I'll bake you a wedding cake that'll taste as  good as anything you could get in Montreal, even if it won't look so  stylish.\"    \"What will Father say?\" I questioned.    \"Lots o' things,\" conceded Aunt Philippa grimly. \"But I don't see as  it matters when neither you nor me'll be there to have our feelings  hurt. I'll write a few things to your father. He hasn't got much  sense. He ought to be thankful to get a decent young man for his  son-in-law in a world where most every man is a wolf in sheep's  clothing. But that's the men for you.\"    And that was Aunt Philippa for you. For the next three weeks she was a  blissfully excited, busy woman. I was allowed to choose the material  and fashion of my wedding suit and hat myself, but almost everything  else was settled by Aunt Philippa. I didn't mind; it was a relief to  be rid of all responsibility; I did protest when she declared her  intention of having a big wedding and asking all the cousins and  semi-cousins on the island, but Aunt Philippa swept my objections  lightly aside.    \"I'm bound to have one good wedding in this house,\" she said. \"Not  likely I'll ever have another chance.\"    She found time amid all the baking and concocting to warn me  frequently not to take it too much to heart if Mark failed to come  after all.    \"I know a man who jilted a girl on her wedding day. That's the men for  you. It's best to be prepared.\"    But Mark did come, getting there the evening before our wedding day.  And then a severe blow fell on Aunt Philippa. Word came from the manse  that Mr. Bentwell had been suddenly summoned to Nova Scotia to his  mother's deathbed; he had started that night.    \"That's the men for you,\" said Aunt Philippa bitterly. \"Never can  depend on one of them, not even on a minister. What's to be done now?\"    \"Get another minister,\" said Mark easily.    \"Where'll you get him?\" demanded Aunt Philippa. \"The minister at  Cliftonville is away on his vacation, and Mercer is vacant, and that  leaves none nearer than town. It won't do to depend on a town minister  being able to come. No, there's no help for it. You'll have to have  that Methodist man.\"    Aunt Philippa's tone was tragic. Plainly she thought the ceremony  would scarcely be legal if that Methodist man married us. But neither  Mark nor I cared. We were too happy to be disturbed by any such  trifles.    The young Methodist minister married us the next day in the presence  of many beaming guests. Aunt Philippa, splendid in black silk and  point-lace collar, neither of which lost a whit of dignity or lustre  by being made ten years before, was composure itself while the  ceremony was going on. But no sooner had the minister pronounced us  man and wife than she spoke up.    \"Now that's over I want someone to go right out and put out the fire  on the kitchen roof. It's been on fire for the last ten minutes.\"    Minister and bridegroom headed the emergency brigade, and Aunt  Philippa pumped the water for them. In a short time the fire was out,  all was safe, and we were receiving our deferred congratulations.    \"Now, young man,\" said Aunt Philippa solemnly as she shook hands with  Mark, \"don't you ever try to get out of this, even if a Methodist  minister did marry you.\"    She insisted on driving us to the train and said goodbye to us as we  stood on the car steps. She had caught more of the shower of rice than  I had, and as the day was hot and sunny she had tied over her head,  atop of that festal silk dress, a huge, home-made, untrimmed straw  hat. But she did not look ridiculous. There was a certain dignity  about Aunt Philippa in any costume and under any circumstance.    \"Aunt Philippa,\" I said, \"tell me this: why have you helped me to be  married?\"    The train began to move.    \"I refused once to run away myself, and I've repented it ever since.\"  Then, as the train gathered speed and the distance between us widened,  she shouted after us, \"But I s'pose if I had run away I'd have  repented of that too.\"          Bessie's Doll      Tommy Puffer, sauntering up the street, stopped to look at Miss  Octavia's geraniums. Tommy never could help stopping to look at Miss  Octavia's flowers, much as he hated Miss Octavia. Today they were  certainly worth looking at. Miss Octavia had set them all out on her  verandah--rows upon rows of them, overflowing down the steps in waves  of blossom and colour. Miss Octavia's geraniums were famous in  Arundel, and she was very proud of them. But it was her garden which  was really the delight of her heart. Miss Octavia always had the  prettiest garden in Arundel, especially as far as annuals were  concerned. Just now it was like faith--the substance of things hoped  for. The poppies and nasturtiums and balsams and morning glories and  sweet peas had been sown in the brown beds on the lawn, but they had  not yet begun to come up.    Tommy was still feasting his eyes on the geraniums when Miss Octavia  herself came around the corner of the house. Her face darkened the  minute she saw Tommy. Most people's did. Tommy had the reputation of  being a very bad, mischievous boy; he was certainly very poor and  ragged, and Miss Octavia disapproved of poverty and rags on principle.  Nobody, she argued, not even a boy of twelve, need be poor and ragged  if he is willing to work.    \"Here, you, get away out of this,\" she said sharply. \"I'm not going to  have you hanging over my palings.\"    \"I ain't hurting your old palings,\" retorted Tommy sullenly. \"I was  jist a-looking at the flowers.\"    \"Yes, and picking out the next one to throw a stone at,\" said Miss  Octavia sarcastically. \"It was you who threw that stone and broke my  big scarlet geranium clear off the other day.\"    \"It wasn't--I never chucked a stone at your flowers,\" said Tommy.    \"Don't tell me any falsehoods, Tommy Puffer. It was you. Didn't I  catch you firing stones at my cat a dozen times?\"    \"I might have fired 'em at an old cat, but I wouldn't tech a flower,\"  avowed Tommy boldly--brazenly, Miss Octavia thought.    \"You clear out of this or I'll make you,\" she said warningly.    Tommy had had his ears boxed by Miss Octavia more than once. He had no  desire to have the performance repeated, so he stuck his tongue out at  Miss Octavia and then marched up the street with his hands in his  pockets, whistling jauntily.    \"He's the most impudent brat I ever saw in my life,\" muttered Miss  Octavia wrathfully. There was a standing feud between her and all the  Arundel small boys, but Tommy was her special object of dislike.    Tommy's heart was full of wrath and bitterness as he marched away. He  hated Miss Octavia; he wished something would happen to every one of  her flowers; he knew it was Ned Williams who had thrown that stone,  and he hoped Ned would throw some more and smash all the flowers. So  Tommy raged along the street until he came to Mr. Blacklock's store,  and in the window of it he saw something that put Miss Octavia and her  disagreeable remarks quite out of his tow-coloured head.    This was nothing more or less than a doll. Now, Tommy was not a judge  of dolls and did not take much interest in them, but he felt quite  sure that this was a very fine one. It was so big; it was beautifully  dressed in blue silk, with a ruffled blue silk hat; it had lovely long  golden hair and big brown eyes and pink cheeks; and it stood right up  in the showcase and held out its hands winningly.    \"Gee, ain't it a beauty!\" said Tommy admiringly. \"It looks 'sif it was  alive, and it's as big as a baby. I must go an' bring Bessie to see  it.\"    Tommy at once hurried away to the shabby little street where what he  called \"home\" was. Tommy's home was a very homeless-looking sort of  place. It was the smallest, dingiest, most slatternly house on a  street noted for its dingy and slatternly houses. It was occupied by a  slatternly mother and a drunken father, as well as by Tommy; and  neither the father nor the mother took much notice of Tommy except to  scold or nag him. So it is hardly to be wondered at if Tommy was the  sort of boy who was frowned upon by respectable citizens.    But one little white blossom of pure affection bloomed in the arid  desert of Tommy's existence for all that. In the preceding fall a new  family had come to Arundel and moved into the tiny house next to the  Puffers'. It was a small, dingy house, just like the others, but  before long a great change took place in it. The new family were  thrifty, industrious folks, although they were very poor. The little  house was white-washed, the paling neatly mended, the bit of a yard  cleaned of all its rubbish. Muslin curtains appeared in the windows,  and rows of cans, with blossoming plants, adorned the sills.    There were just three people in the Knox family--a thin little mother,  who went out scrubbing and took in washing, a boy of ten, who sold  newspapers and ran errands--and Bessie.    Bessie was eight years old and walked with a crutch, but she was a  smart little lassie and kept the house wonderfully neat and tidy while  her mother was away. The very first time she had seen Tommy she had  smiled at him sweetly and said, \"Good morning.\" From that moment Tommy  was her devoted slave. Nobody had ever spoken like that to him before;  nobody had ever smiled so at him. Tommy would"]]]
