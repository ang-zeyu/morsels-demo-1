Many phrases are  so constructed that their proper delivery involves a gradual  _crescendo_ up to the climax (usually the highest tone) and a  corresponding _diminuendo_ from this point to the end of the phrase.    [Sidenote: PHRASING IN VOCAL MUSIC]    In vocal music, the matter of phrasing is comparatively simple because  here the composer has, in general, adapted the melody to the phrasing  of the text; and since in language we have definite ideas and concrete  imagery to assist us, all that we usually need to do in studying the  phrasing of vocal music is to follow carefully the phrasing of the  text. But even then a warning ought perhaps to be given the young  conductor regarding carelessness or ignorance on the part of singers  about some of the most fundamental principles of phrasing. The most  common mistakes made are:         1. Taking breath unnecessarily in the middle of a phrase.         2. Breathing between the syllables of a word.         3. Dividing a long phrase improperly.         4. Running over breathing places where a pause is really       necessary in order to bring out the meaning of the text.         5. Pronouncing the unaccented syllable of a word at the end       of a phrase with too much stress.         6. Failing to stress the climax sufficiently.    Mistakes of this kind are made because the singer all too frequently  fails to recognize the fact that the interpretation of vocal music  must be based upon the meaning of the text rather than upon purely  musical considerations (_cf._ quotation from Caruso on page 44).    A comma or rest ordinarily indicates the end of a phrase in vocal  music. If, however, the phrase as marked is too long to be taken in  one breath, the conductor should study it carefully for some point in  it where another breath may be taken without too greatly marring the  continuity of the text. Sometimes in a large chorus various sections  of a division may take breath at different points, thus preserving the  integrity of the phrase in certain cases where this is particularly  desirable. It should be noted that when a breath is taken in the  middle of a phrase or between the phrases where no rest occurs, the  time for breathing must always be taken from the last note of the  _preceding_ phrase, in order that the continuity of the rhythm may not  be sacrificed.    The importance of studying phrasing from the standpoint of the  effective rendition of sacred music will be realized more vividly if  one takes the trouble to inquire of some of the members of the  congregation how well they understood the words of the anthem or solo.  The replies that will ordinarily be given to such a question will  probably astonish the director of the church choir; and although he  will sometimes be inclined to put the blame on the ears and minds of  the congregation, there is no doubt that in very many cases the  difficulty may be traced to poor enunciation and faulty phrasing on  the part of the singers. The following examples are reported to be  authentic instances of phrasing by church choirs:         Jesus lives no longer now,       Can thy terrors, Death, appall us?    The poet had quite a different thought in mind when he penned these  words, with the correct punctuation marks:         Jesus lives! no longer now       Can thy terrors, Death, appall us!         The wild winds hushed the angry deep,       Sank like a little child to sleep.    What this verse means is, of course, easily seen by inserting the  correct punctuation marks:         The wild winds hushed; the angry deep       Sank like a little child to sleep.    [Sidenote: PHRASING IN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]    In instrumental music we have no definite ideas and no concrete  imagery to guide us; and the conductor, in company with all other  students of instrumental music, will find it necessary to study his  score most carefully if he is to unravel the threads that are woven  together in such complex fashion in orchestral music. As implied  above, phrasing in instrumental music means:         1. The grouping together of tones that belong to the same       musical thought, this implying a slight break in continuity       between phrases, as in language.         2. Making evident the musical significance of the group by       accenting or prolonging its most important tones.    These are only general principles, however, and the details of  phrasing in instrumental music cannot be treated adequately in writing  because of their too great complexity. It is only through practice,  reinforced by the intelligent criticism of a real musician, that skill  and taste in the art of phrasing can be acquired. A few concrete  suggestions are offered, and these may be of some slight help to the  amateur, but they are not to be thought of as \"a complete guide.\"         1. The first tone of the phrase is often stressed slightly       in order to mark the beginning of the new idea.         2. The final tone (particularly of the short phrase) is       commonly shortened in order to make clear the separation       between phrases.         3. The climacteric tone of the phrase is often prolonged       slightly as well as accented, in order to make its       relationship to the other tones stand out clearly.    [Sidenote: RHYTHM]    Closely connected with phrasing is rhythm, and although the rhythmic  factor should perhaps theoretically belong wholly to the composer,  since he is able to express his rhythmic ideas in definite notation,  yet in actual practice this does not prove to be the case because the  amateur player or singer so often finds that \"time is hard\"; and there  are consequently many occasions when the rhythm indicated by the  composer is wholly distorted, either because the performers are weak  in their rhythmic feeling or because the conductor is careless and  does not see to it that the rhythmic response of his chorus or  orchestra is accurate and incisive and yet elastic.    Rhythm is the oldest of the musical elements and there is no question  but that the rhythmic appeal is still the strongest of all for the  majority of people. Rhythm is the spark of life in music, therefore,  woe to the composer who attempts to substitute ethereal harmonies for  virile rhythms as a general principle of musical construction. Mere  tones, even though beautiful both in themselves and through effective  combination, are meaningless, and it is only through rhythm that they  become vitalized. In order to have interesting performances of choral  and orchestral music the conductor must see to it that the performers  play or sing all rhythmic figures correctly, that long tones are  sustained for their correct duration, and that in general the musical  performance be permeated by that steady throb of regular pulsation  which is the foundation of all rhythmic coherence.    Modern musical rhythm is so complex in its frequent employment of  syncopations, \"cross accents,\" _et cetera_, that the prospective  conductor must study indefatigably if he is to unravel its apparently  inextricably snarled-up threads. We assume, however, that detailed  study of rhythm has constituted a part of the student's work in piano,  singing, _et cetera_, and shall therefore not attempt to treat the  matter further. Let us advise the would-be conductor, however, to  continue his study of rhythm and phrasing unceasingly and never to  allow himself to be deluded into believing that an accurate knowledge  of these things is less necessary now than formerly. It has seemed to  us that some public performers of the present day were cloaking their  inability to play or sing with rhythmic accuracy under a pretense of  being highly artistic and flexible in their rhythmic feeling. Needless  to say, the existence of such a state of affairs is to be greatly  deplored and the student is admonished to make sure that he is able to  perform every detail of his music with metronomic accuracy before he  attempts _rubato_ effects.    [Sidenote: MELODY, HARMONY, AND PITCH REGISTERS]    The second, third, and fourth of the elements of expression as cited  in our list on page 46 belong almost wholly to the composer since he  is able to indicate them precisely, and the conductor's chief concern  in dealing with melody, harmony, and pitch registers will be to make  certain that the composer's wishes are carried out to the letter. For  this reason no attempt will be made to discuss these matters further,  the topic belonging to composition rather than to conducting.    [Sidenote: PHYSICAL MEANS USED BY THE CONDUCTOR FOR INDICATING  EXPRESSIONAL EFFECTS]    Now that we have reviewed the elements of expression somewhat fully,  what of the conductor? Shall we give him a set of specific directions  for making his chorus or orchestra sing or play more loudly or more  rapidly or more dramatically? Our reply is--no, not any more than we  should attempt to show the student of acting or oratory exactly what  gestures he is to make use of in playing upon the emotions of his  audience. As implied at the outset, the thing that is necessary in  both cases is that the interpreter have:         1. General scholarship.         2. An intimate acquaintance with the content and spirit of       the particular work to be interpreted.    Granting the presence of these two things, the actual gestures will  usually take care of themselves. The conductor Altschuler remarks on  this point:         There is no artificial code of signals needed between the       conductor and his men; what the conductor needs is a clear       conception of the composition.    We are fully in accord with this sentiment; but for the benefit of the  tyro it may be well to note again that, in general, a quickening of  tempo is indicated by a shorter, more vigorous stroke of the baton,  whereas a slowing down in rate of speed, especially when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#14)"],[1,"his steed, with its  trappings of gold and purple, excited their admiration. But all  wondered to see that Beaumains had neither shield nor spear, and some  laughed and said, 'The ignorant churl! Doth he think the mere sight of  him on horseback will affright his enemies, that he carries neither  shield nor lance.'    Sir Kay sneered with them, and suddenly getting up from his seat he  cried:    'By my faith! I will go after my kitchen boy and see whether he will  still know me for his better!'    'Ye had better bide at home,' said Sir Lancelot, and Sir Gawaine  agreed.    But Sir Kay laughed them aside, and having swiftly put on his armour,  he took his spear and shield and rode after Beaumains. He caught up  with the youth just as the latter reached the side of the damsel, and  Sir Kay cried out, with a scornful laugh:    'What! Beaumains, do ye not know me?'    'Ay,' replied Beaumains, 'I know ye for the most ungentle knight in all  King Arthur's court, and therefore keep you off from me.'    'Ah, churl!' cried Sir Kay, 'thou needst a lesson from me. A beggar,  though he be on horseback, is still a beggar.'    With that he put his lance in rest and dashed towards Beaumains,  expecting an easy victory. But the young man, putting the lance aside  with his sword just as it was about to strike him, rushed upon Sir Kay,  and with a deft thrust struck him through a joint of his armour, so  that Sir Kay fell backwards off his horse to the ground. Swiftly  leaping down, Beaumains took possession of his opponent's spear and  shield, and commanded his dwarf to mount upon Sir Kay's horse.    Then, after remounting, Beaumains rejoined the damsel, who had seen all  that had taken place, but said nothing.    At that moment they saw Sir Lancelot coming towards him. He had seen  Sir Kay's discomfiture, and wondered at the mastery which Beaumains had  shown.    'Fair sir,' cried Beaumains, turning and drawing rein as Sir Lancelot  approached, 'I would joust with you, if ye will.'    'Have at you, then!' replied Sir Lancelot with a laugh, and with spears  in rest they set their horses at a great gallop. They came together so  fiercely that they were both thrust backwards from their saddles and  fell to the earth, half stunned and greatly bruised.    Sir Lancelot recovered first and ran to help Beaumains to his feet, and  then, with their shields before them, they continued the combat with  swords. For an hour they strove fiercely, thrusting, striking and  parrying like two great boars in a forest clearing. Sir Lancelot was  astonished to feel how great was the young man's strength, how swift  were his thrusts, and how powerful were his blows. He recognised that  Beaumains was a dangerous fighter, and that he himself would have much  to do to overcome him.    'Beaumains,' he cried at length, 'fight not so hard, lad. Our quarrel,  if we have aught, is surely not so great that we cannot leave off.'    'That is truth!' said Beaumains, laughing, as he dropped the point of  his weapon. 'But, Sir Lancelot, it doth me good to feel your wondrous  skill and the strength of your arm. Yet, my lord, I have not shown the  uttermost of mine.'    'By my faith, I believe ye,' cried Sir Lancelot, 'for I should have  much ado to keep myself from shameful defeat if you should really push  me to the utmost. Therefore I say that you need not fear any earthly  knight.'    'I thank you for your good words,' replied Beaumains. 'And do you think  I may hope at any time to become a proved knight?'    'Fight as you have fought with me, and I have no doubt of you.'    'Then, I pray you, my lord,' said Beaumains, 'give me the order of  knighthood.'    'Ere I do that, you must tell me your name and of what kin you were  born,' replied Sir Lancelot.    'If you will promise to tell no one, I will reveal it.'    Sir Lancelot gave his promise, and Beaumains, going closer, whispered  some words into Sir Lancelot's ear.    'Ah, sir,' said Sir Lancelot, taking the young man's hand in his, 'I am  glad I was not deceived. I knew you must come of great kin, and that  you had not come to King Arthur for meat or drink. Kneel now, and I  will make you knight.'    So Beaumains knelt before Sir Lancelot, who lightly touched him on the  shoulder with his sword, naming him knight.    Thereupon they parted with many kind words, and Beaumains made haste to  overtake the damsel, who had long since disappeared.    As for Sir Kay, he was lifted upon Sir Lancelot's shield and taken back  to the court, and there slowly he recovered of his wound. Men laughed  him to scorn for the beating he had received from his own 'kitchen  boy.'    'Lo,' said some, 'the proud knight went forth to cuff his own scullion,  and the scullion beat him sore and took his weapons for spoil.'    When Beaumains reached the side of the damsel, she pulled up her horse  and turned upon him with flashing eyes and angry looks.    'What doest thou here?' she cried. 'Away from me--thou smellest of the  kitchen, knave! Pah! thy clothes are foul with grease and tallow! Dost  thou think to ride with me?'    'Lady,' said Beaumains, and he spoke full gently, 'my clothes may be  smirched, but my arm, I trust, is as strong to defend you as any that  is wrapped in silk.'    'Out upon thee, saucy churl!' she cried. 'Thinkest thou I should allow  for that knight whom you thrust from his horse but now? Nay, not a whit  do I, for thou didst strike him foully and like a coward! I know thee  well, for Sir Kay named you. Beaumains you are, dainty of hands and of  eating, like a spoilt page. Get thee gone, thou turner of spits and  washer of greasy dishes!'    But for all that she raved, Beaumains would not reply in angry words,  though his heart burned within him.    'Damsel,' said he courteously, 'ye may say what ye will to me, but I  will not go from you whatever you say. I have given my promise to King  Arthur that I will achieve this adventure for you, and that will I do  or die in the trial of it.'    The girl laughed mockingly.    '_You_ will finish my adventure--_you_ will come to our aid!' she cried  in scorn. 'Fie on thee, thou upstart kitchen page! But if you will not  go from me, then come, fool, and I shall see thee quickly shamed. Thou  art proud with the too good living thou hadst in Arthur's kitchen, but  one I know whose face thou wilt not dare to look into, my knight of the  kitchen!'    So saying, she pushed on her horse, and thus in silence they went on  together.    In a little while they came to a dark wood, and suddenly as they rode,  a man with white scared face started from behind a bush and ran to the  side of Beaumains.    'Go not that way, sir knight,' he said, 'for there be six knaves who  have taken my lord and bound him, and now they will surely take you and  your lady unless you go back. I barely escaped with my life, and hid  when I heard you, thinking you were of their thievish company.'    'Take me to them!' cried Beaumains, and the poor squire, holding the  knight's stirrup-leather, ran with him. And surely, in a little while,  three knaves rushed forth before them in the green drive and bade  Beaumains stand. But grimly he dashed at them, before ever they could  recover. Two he cut down with his good sword as they stood, and the  third, trying to escape, was run between the shoulders.    Then turning, Beaumains saw in a glade near the drive where three other  knaves stood beside a knight bound to a tree. They dashed towards  Beaumains with spiked clubs uplifted. But the squire rushed at one,  tripped him up and despatched him; and the others suddenly decided to  turn and flee. Their resolution came too late, however, for Beaumains  cut them down as they ran.    The knight was quickly released by his squire, and came up to his  rescuer, and thanked him heartily for his speedy help.    'Come with me,' he said, 'you and your lady, to my castle, which is but  a little way hence, and I will fittingly requite thee for the saving of  my life.'    'Nay,' said Beaumains, 'I will have no reward. All I do henceforth is  but my duty, and I will take naught in payment. Moreover, I must follow  this lady.'    The knight went to the lady, and begged that she would accept his  hospitality, for the twilight was deepening and they were yet far from  a town. The damsel consented, but, on reaching the castle of the  knight, she would not permit Beaumains to sit at the same table with  her.    'Take the knave hence!' she cried haughtily. 'He is but a scullion from  King Arthur's kitchen, and is not fit to sit with a lady of rank. He is  more suited, sir knight, to dine with your turnspits.'    'Lady, I do not understand your words,' said the knight, 'for this  gentleman hath proved himself a man of knightly courage and courtesy  this day.'    'As for that,' said the lady, 'I count it naught. He took the rascals  unawares, and they had no heart. They were but sorrier knaves than he  is.'    'Well,' said the knight, 'since you mislike him so, he shall sit with  me, and you shall sit alone.'    So it was done, and while the lady sat eating her meal in chilly  silence at one table, Beaumains and the knight, his host, laughed and  talked merrily over their dinner at another.    Next morning, early, Beaumains and the lady were up and away while yet  the dew shone on the leaves. Soon they passed through a great forest  and approached a wide river. In a little while they rode down to where  a roughly paved way ran into the water, and, looking to the other bank,  Beaumains was aware of two knights on horseback, stationed as if to  hinder his passing the ford.    'Now, sir kitchen knight,' laughed the lady mockingly, 'what sayest  thou? Art thou a match for these two knights, or wilt thou not turn  back?'    'I would not turn if they were six,' replied Beaumains quietly.    With that he rushed, with spear at rest, into the ford, and one of the  waiting knights came swiftly against him. They met in the midst with so  "]]]
