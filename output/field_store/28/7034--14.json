The variety thus formed will either coexist with, or,  more commonly, will exterminate its parent form. An organic being, like  the woodpecker or misseltoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of  contingences--natural selection accumulating those slight variations in  all parts of its structure, which are in any way useful to it during any  part of its life.    5. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one, with respect to this  theory. Many can, I think, be satisfactorily answered. _Natura non facit  saltum_ answers some of the most obvious. The slowness of the change,  and only a very few individuals undergoing change at any one time,  answers others. The extreme imperfection of our geological records  answers others.    6. Another principle, which may be called the principle of divergence,  plays, I believe, an important part in the origin of species. The same  spot will support more life if occupied by very diverse forms. We see  this in the many generic forms in a square yard of turf, and in the  plants or insects on any little uniform islet, belonging almost  invariably to as many genera and families as species. We can understand  the meaning of this fact amongst the higher animals, whose habits we  understand. We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot of  land will yield a greater weight if sown with several species and genera  of grasses, than if sown with only two or three species. Now, every  organic being, by propagating so rapidly, may be said to be striving its  utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be with the offspring of any  species after it has become diversified into varieties, or subspecies,  or true species. And it follows, I think, from the foregoing facts, that  the varying offspring of each species will try (only few will succeed)  to seize on as many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as  possible. Each new variety or species, when formed, will generally take  the place of, and thus exterminate its less well-fitted parent. This I  believe to be the origin of the classification and affinities of organic  beings at all times; for organic beings always _seem_ to branch and  sub-branch like the limbs of a tree from a common trunk, the flourishing  and diverging twigs destroying the less vigorous--the dead and lost  branches rudely representing extinct genera and families.    This sketch is _most_ imperfect; but in so short a space I cannot make  it better. Your imagination must fill up very wide blanks.    C. DARWIN.      III. _On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the  Original Type._ By ALFRED RUSSELL WALLACE.    One of the strongest arguments which have been adduced to prove the  original and permanent distinctness of species is, that _varieties_  produced in a state of domesticity are more or less unstable, and often  have a tendency, if left to themselves, to return to the normal form of  the parent species; and this instability is considered to be a  distinctive peculiarity of all varieties, even of those occurring among  wild animals in a state of nature, and to constitute a provision for  preserving unchanged the originally created distinct species.    In the absence or scarcity of facts and observations as to _varieties_  occurring among wild animals, this argument has had great weight with  naturalists, and has led to a very general and somewhat prejudiced  belief in the stability of species. Equally general, however, is the  belief in what are called \"permanent or true varieties,\"--races of  animals which continually propagate their like, but which differ so  slightly (although constantly) from some other race, that the one is  considered to be a _variety_ of the other. Which is the _variety_ and  which the original _species_, there is generally no means of  determining, except in those rare cases in which the one race has been  known to produce an offspring unlike itself and resembling the other.  This, however, would seem quite incompatible with the \"permanent  invariability of species,\" but the difficulty is overcome by assuming  that such varieties have strict limits, and can never again vary further  from the original type, although they may return to it, which, from the  analogy of the domesticated animals, is considered to be highly  probable, if not certainly proved.    It will be observed that this argument rests entirely on the assumption,  that _varieties_ occurring in a state of nature are in all respects  analogous to or even identical with those of domestic animals, and are  governed by the same laws as regards their permanence or further  variation. But it is the object of the present paper to show that this  assumption is altogether false, that there is a general principle in  nature which will cause many _varieties_ to survive the parent species,  and to give rise to successive variations departing further and further  from the original type, and which also produces, in domesticated  animals, the tendency of varieties to return to the parent form.    The life of wild animals is a struggle for existence. The full exertion  of all their faculties and all their energies is required to preserve  their own existence and provide for that of their infant offspring. The  possibility of procuring food during the least favourable seasons, and  of escaping the attacks of their most dangerous enemies, are the primary  conditions which determine the existence both of individuals and of  entire species. These conditions will also determine the population of a  species; and by a careful consideration of all the circumstances we may  be enabled to comprehend, and in some degree to explain, what at first  sight appears so inexplicable--the excessive abundance of some species,  while others closely allied to them are very rare.    The general proportion that must obtain between certain groups of  animals is readily seen. Large animals cannot be so abundant as small  ones; the carnivora must be less numerous than the herbivora; eagles and  lions can never be so plentiful as pigeons and antelopes; the wild asses  of the Tartarian deserts cannot equal in numbers the horses of the more  luxuriant prairies and pampas of America. The greater or less fecundity  of an animal is often considered to be one of the chief causes of its  abundance or scarcity; but a consideration of the facts will show us  that it really has little or nothing to do with the matter. Even the  least prolific of animals would increase rapidly if unchecked, whereas  it is evident that the animal population of the globe must be  stationary, or perhaps, through the influence of man, decreasing.  Fluctuations there may be; but permanent increase, except in restricted  localities, is almost impossible. For example, our own observation must  convince us that birds do not go on increasing every year in a  geometrical ratio, as they would do, were there not some powerful check  to their natural increase. Very few birds produce less than two young  ones each year, while many have six, eight, or ten; four will certainly  be below the average; and if we suppose that each pair produce young  only four times in their life, that will also be below the average,  supposing them not to die either by violence or want of food. Yet at  this rate how tremendous would be the increase in a few years from a  single pair! A simple calculation will show that in fifteen years each  pair of birds would have increased to nearly ten millions! whereas we  have no reason to believe that the number of the birds of any country  increases at all in fifteen or in one hundred and fifty years. With such  powers of increase the population must have reached its limits, and have  become stationary, in a very low years after the origin of each species.  It is evident, therefore, that each year an immense number of birds must  perish--as many in fact as are born; and as on the lowest calculation  the progeny are each year twice as numerous as their parents, it follows  that, whatever be the average number of individuals existing in any  given country, _twice that number must perish annually_,--a striking  result, but one which seems at least highly probable, and is perhaps  under rather than over the truth. It would therefore appear that, as far  as the continuance of the species and the keeping up the average number  of individuals are concerned, large broods are superfluous. On the  average all above _one_ become food for hawks and kites, wild cats and  weasels, or perish of cold and hunger as winter comes on. This is  strikingly proved by the case of particular species; for we find that  their abundance in individuals bears no relation whatever to their  fertility in producing offspring. Perhaps the most remarkable instance  of an immense bird population is that of the passenger pigeon of the  United States, which lays only one, or at most two eggs, and is said to  rear generally but one young one. Why is this bird so extraordinarily  abundant, while others producing two or three times as many young are  much less plentiful? The explanation is not difficult. The food most  congenial to this species, and on which it thrives best, is abundantly  distributed over a very extensive region, offering such differences of  soil and climate, that in one part or another of the area the supply  never fails. The bird is capable of a very rapid and long-continued  flight, so that it can pass without fatigue over the whole of the  district it inhabits, and as soon as the supply of food begins to fail  in one place is able to discover a fresh feeding-ground. This example  strikingly shows us that the procuring a constant supply of wholesome  food is almost the sole condition requisite for ensuring the rapid  increase of a given species, since neither the limited fecundity, nor  the unrestrained attacks of birds of prey and of man are here sufficient  to check it.

Cymatium._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 192. Ogee-Recta._]    THE CYMATIUM.--Fig. 191 is the cymatium (derived from the word cyme),  meaning wave-like. This form must be in two curves, one inwardly and one  outwardly.    THE OGEE.--Fig. 192, called the ogee, is the most useful of all  moldings, for two reasons: First, it may have the concaved surface  uppermost, in which form it is called ogee recta--that is, right side  up; or it may be inverted, as in Fig. 193, with the concaved surface  below, and is then called ogee reversa. Contrast these two views and you  will note what a difference the mere inversion of the strip makes in the  appearance. Second, because the ogee has in it, in a combined form, the  outlines of nearly all the other types. The only advantage there is in  using the other types is because you may thereby build up and space your  work better than by using only one simple form.    [Illustration: _Fig. 193. Ogee-Reversa._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 194. Bead or Reedy._]    You will notice that the ogee is somewhat like the cymatium, the  difference being that the concaved part is not so pronounced as in the  ogee, and the convexed portion bulges much further than in the ogee. It  is capable of use with other moldings, and may be reversed with just as  good effect as the ogee.    THE REEDY.--Fig. 194 represents the reedy, or the bead--that is, it is  made up of reeds. It is a type of molding which should not be used with  any other pronounced type of molding.    THE CASEMENT (Fig. 195).--In this we have a form of molding used almost  exclusively at the base of structures, such as columns, porticoes and  like work.    [Illustration:_ Fig. 195. Casement._]    Now, before proceeding to use these moldings, let us examine a  Roman-Doric column, one of the most famous types of architecture  produced. We shall see how the ancients combined moldings to produce  grace, lights and shadows and artistic effects.    THE ROMAN-DORIC COLUMN.--In Fig. 196 is shown a Roman-Doric column, in  which the cymatium, the ovolo, cavetto, astragal and the ogee are used,  together with the fillets, bases and caps, and it is interesting to  study this because of its beautiful proportions.    [Illustration: _Fig. 196._]    The pedestal and base are equal in vertical dimensions to the  entablature and capital. The entablature is but slightly narrower than  the pedestal; and the length of the column is, approximately, four times  the height of the pedestal. The base of the shaft, while larger  diametrically than the capital, is really shorter measured vertically.  There is a reason for this. The eye must travel a greater distance to  reach the upper end of the shaft, and is also at a greater angle to that  part of the shaft, hence it appears shorter, while it is in reality  longer. For this reason a capital must be longer or taller than the base  of a shaft, and it is also smaller in diameter.    It will be well to study the column not only on account of the wonderful  blending of the various forms of moldings, but because it will impress  you with a sense of proportions, and give you an idea of how simple  lines may be employed to great advantage in all your work.    LESSONS FROM THE DORIC COLUMN.--As an example, suppose we take a plain  cabinet, and endeavor to embellish it with the types of molding  described, and you will see to what elaboration the operation may be  carried.    APPLYING MOLDING.--Let Fig. 197 represent the front, top and bottom of  our cabinet; and the first thing we shall do is to add a base (A) and a  cap (B). Now, commencing at the top, suppose we utilize the simplest  form of molding, the band.    This we may make of any desired width, as shown in Fig. 198. On this  band we can apply the ogee type (Fig. 199) right side up.    But for variation we may decide to use the ogee reversed, as in Fig.  200. This will afford us something else to think about and will call  upon our powers of initiative in order to finish off the lower margin or  edge of the ogee reversa.    [Illustration: _Fig. 197._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 198._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 199._]    If we take the ogee recta, as shown in Fig. 201, we may use the cavetto,  or the ovolo (Fig. 202); but if we use the ogee reversa we must use a  convex molding like the cavetto at one base, and a convex molding, like  the torus or the ovolo, at the other base.    In the latter (Fig. 202) four different moldings are used with the ogee  as the principal structure.    BASE EMBELLISHMENTS.--In like manner (Fig. 204) the base may have the  casement type first attached in the corner, and then the ovolo, or the  astragal added, as in Fig. 203.    [Illustration: _Fig. 200._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 201._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 202._]    STRAIGHT-FACED MOLDINGS.--Now let us carry the principle still further,  and, instead of using various type of moldings, we will employ nothing  but straight strips of wood. This treatment will soon indicate to you  that the true mechanic or artisan is he who can take advantage of  whatever he finds at hand.    Let us take the same cabinet front (Fig. 205), and below the cap (A)  place a narrow strip (B), the lower corner of which has been chamfered  off, as at C. Below the strip B is a thinner strip (D), vertically  disposed, and about two-thirds its width. The lower corner of this is  also chamfered, as at F. To finish, apply a small strip (G) in the  corner, and you have an embellished top that has the appearance, from a  short distance, of being made up of molding.    PLAIN MOLDED BASE.--The base may be treated in the same manner. The main  strip (4) has its upper corner chamfered off, as at I, and on this is  nailed a thin, narrow finishing strip (J). The upper part or molded top,  in this case, has eleven distinct lines, and the base has six lines. By  experimenting you may soon put together the most available kinds of  molding strips.    [Illustration: _Fig. 203._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 204._]    DIVERSIFIED USES.--For a great overhang you may use the cavetto, or the  apophyges, and below that the astragal or the torus; and for the base  the casement is the most serviceable molding, and it may be finished off  with the ovolo or the cymatium.    Pages of examples might be cited to show the variety and the  diversification available with different types.    SHADOWS CAST BY MOLDINGS.--Always bear in mind that a curved surface  makes a blended shadow. A straight, flat or plain surface does not, and  it is for that reason the concaved and the convexed surfaces, brought  out by moldings, become so important.    [Illustration: _Fig. 205._]    A little study and experimenting will soon teach you how a convex, a  concave or a flat surface, and a corner or corners should be arranged  relatively to each other; how much one should project beyond the other;  and what the proportional widths of the different molding bands should  be. An entire volume would scarcely exhaust this subject.          CHAPTER X    AN ANALYSIS OF TENONING, MORTISING, RABBETING AND BEADING      In the chapter on How Work is Laid Out, an example was given of the  particular manner pursued in laying out mortises and tenons, and also  dovetailed work. I deem it advisable to add some details to the subject,  as well as to direct attention to some features which do not properly  belong to the laying out of work.    WHERE MORTISES SHOULD BE USED.--Most important of all is a general idea  of places and conditions under which mortises should be resorted to.  There are four ways in which different members may be secured to each  other. First, by mortises and tenons; second, by a lap-and-butt; third,  by scarfing; and, fourth, by tonguing and grooving.    DEPTH OF MORTISES.--When a certain article is to be made, the first  consideration is, how the joint or joints shall be made. The general  rule for using the tenon and mortise is where two parts are joined  wherein the grains of the two members run at right angles to each  other, as in the following figure.    RULE FOR MORTISES.--Fig. 206 shows such an example. You will notice this  in doors particularly, as an example of work.    [Illustration: _Fig. 206._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 207._]    The next consideration is, shall the mortises be cut entirely through  the piece? This is answered by the query as to whether or not the end of  the tenon will be exposed; and usually, if a smooth finish is required,  the mortise should not go through the member. In a door, however, the  tenons are exposed at the edges of the door, and are, therefore, seen,  so that we must apply some other rule. The one universally adopted is,  that where, as in a door stile, it is broad and comparatively thin, or  where the member having the mortise in its edge is much thinner than  its width, the mortise should go through from edge to edge.    The reason for this lies in the inability to sink the mortises through  the stile (A, Fig. 207) perfectly true, and usually the job is turned  out something like the illustration shows. The side of the rail (B) must  be straight with the side of the stile. If the work is done by machinery  it results in accuracy unattainable in hand work.    [Illustration: _Fig. 208._]    TRUE MORTISE WORK.--The essense of good joining work is the ability to  sink the chisel true with the side of the member. More uneven work is  produced by haste than by inability. The tendency of all beginners is  to strike the chisel too hard, in order the more quickly to get down to  the bottom of the mortise. Hence, bad work follows.    STEPS IN CUTTING MORTISES.--Examine Fig. 208, which, for convenience,  gives six successive steps in making the mortise. The marks _a_, _b_  designate the limits, or the length, of the mortise. The chisel (C) is  not started at the marking line (A), but at least an eighth of an inch  from it. The first"]]]
