Now this wonderful  fact of hand, hoof, wing, paddle and claw being the same, is at once  explicable on the principle of some parent-forms, which might either be  <illegible> or walking animals, becoming through infinite number of small  selections adapted to various conditions. We know that proportion,  size, shape of bones and their accompanying soft parts vary, and hence  constant selection would alter, to almost any purpose <?> the framework  of an organism, but yet would leave a general, even closest similarity in  it.         {145} Written between the lines occurs:--\"extend to birds and other       classes.\"         {146} Written between the lines occurs:--\"many bones merely       represented.\"         {147} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 434, vi. p. 595, the term       _morphology_ is taken as including _unity of type_. The paddle of       the porpoise and the wing of the bat are there used as instances of       morphological resemblance.         {148} The sentence is difficult to decipher.    [We know the number of similar parts, as vertebrae and ribs can vary,  hence this also we might expect.] Also <if> the changes carried on to a  certain point, doubtless type will be lost, and this is case with  Plesiosaurus{149}. The unity of type in past and present ages of certain  great divisions thus undoubtedly receives the simplest explanation.         {149} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 436, vi. p. 598, the author speaks       of the \"general pattern\" being obscured in the paddles of \"extinct       gigantic sea-lizards.\"    There is another class of allied and almost identical facts, admitted by  the soberest physiologists, [from the study of a certain set of organs  in a group of organisms] and refers <? referring> to a unity of type of  different organs in the same individual, denominated the science of  \"Morphology.\" The <? this> discovered by beautiful and regular series,  and in the case of plants from monstrous changes, that certain organs in  an individual are other organs metamorphosed. Thus every botanist  considers petals, nectaries, stamens, pistils, germen as metamorphosed  leaf. They thus explain, in the most lucid manner, the position and  number of all parts of the flower, and the curious conversion under  cultivation of one part into another. The complicated double set of jaws  and palpi of crustaceans{150}, and all insects are considered as  metamorphosed <limbs> and to see the series is to admit this phraseology.  The skulls of the vertebrates are undoubtedly composed of three  metamorphosed vertebrae; thus we can understand the strange form of the  separate bones which compose the casket holding man's brain. These{151}  facts differ but slightly from those of last section, if with wing,  paddle, hand and hoof, some common structure was yet visible, or could  be made out by a series of occasional monstrous conversions, and if  traces could be discovered of <the> whole having once existed as walking or  swimming instruments, these organs would be said to be metamorphosed, as  it is they are only said to exhibit a common type.         {150} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 437, vi. p. 599.         {151} The following passage seems to have been meant to precede the       sentence beginning \"These facts\":--\"It is evident, that when in       each individual species, organs are metamorph. a unity of type       extends.\"    This distinction is not drawn by physiologists, and is only implied by  some by their general manner of writing. These facts, though affecting  every organic being on the face of the globe, which has existed, or does  exist, can only be viewed by the Creationist as ultimate and  inexplicable facts. But this unity of type through the individuals of a  group, and this metamorphosis of the same organ into other organs,  adapted to diverse use, necessarily follows on the theory of  descent{152}. For let us take case of Vertebrata, which if{153} they  descended from one parent and by this theory all the Vertebrata have  been altered by slow degrees, such as we see in domestic animals. We  know that proportions alter, and even that occasionally numbers of  vertebrae alter, that parts become soldered, that parts are lost, as tail  and toes, but we know <that?> here we can see that possibly a walking organ  might <?> be converted into swimming or into a gliding organ and so on to a  flying organ. But such gradual changes would not alter the unity of type  in their descendants, as parts lost and soldered and vertebrae. But we  can see that if this carried to extreme, unity lost,--Plesiosaurus. Here  we have seen the same organ is formed <?> <for> different purposes  <ten words illegible>: and if, in several orders of vertebrata, we could  trace origin <of> spinous processes and monstrosities &c. we should say,  instead of there existing a unity of type, morphology{154}, as we do  when we trace the head as being the vertebrae metamorphosed. Be it  observed that Naturalists, as they use terms of affinity without  attaching real meaning, here also they are obliged to use metamorphosis,  without meaning that any parent of crustacean was really an animal with  as many legs as crustacean has jaws. The theory of descent at once  explains these wonderful facts.         {152} This is, I believe, the first place in which the author uses       the words \"theory of descent.\"         {153} The sentence should probably run, \"Let us take the case of       the vertebrata: if we assume them to be descended from one parent,       then by this theory they have been altered &c.\"         {154} That is \"we should call it a morphological fact.\"    Now few of the physiologists who use this language really suppose that  the parent of insect with the metamorphosed jaw, was an insect with  [more] so many legs, or that the parent of flowering plants, originally  had no stamens, or pistils or petals, but some other means of  propagation,--and so in other cases. Now according to our theory during  the infinite number of changes, we might expect that an organ used for a  purpose might be used for a different one by his descendant, as must  have been the case by our theory with the bat, porpoise, horse, &c.,  which are descended from one parent. And if it so chanced that traces of  the former use and structure of the part should be retained, which is  manifestly possible if not probable, then we should have the organs, on  which morphology is founded and which instead of being metaphorical  becomes plain and <and instead of being> utterly unintelligible becomes  simple matter of fact{155}.         {155} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 438, vi. p. 602, the author,       referring to the expressions used by naturalists in regard to       morphology and metamorphosis, says \"On my view these terms may be       used literally.\"    <_Embryology._> This general unity of type in great groups of organisms  (including of course these morphological cases) displays itself in a  most striking manner in the stages through which the foetus passes{156}.  In early stage, the wing of bat, hoof, hand, paddle are not to be  distinguished. At a still earlier <stage> there is no difference between  fish, bird, &c. &c. and mammal. It is not that they cannot be  distinguished, but the arteries{157} <illegible>. It is not true that  one passes through the form of a lower group, though no doubt fish more  nearly related to foetal state{158}.         {156} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 439, vi. p. 605.         {157} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 440, vi. p. 606, the author argues       that the \"loop-like course of the arteries\" in the vertebrate       embryo has no direct relation to the conditions of existence.         {158} The following passages are written across the page:--\"They       pass through the same phases, but some, generally called the higher       groups, are further metamorphosed.         ? Degradation and complication? no tendency to perfection.         ? Justly argued against Lamarck?\"    This similarity at the earliest stage is remarkably shown in the course  of the arteries which become greatly altered, as foetus advances in life  and assumes the widely different course and number which characterize  full-grown fish and mammals. How wonderful that in egg, in water or air,  or in womb of mother, artery{159} should run in same course.         {159} An almost identical passage occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.       440, vi. p. 606.    Light can be thrown on this by our theory. The structure of each  organism is chiefly adapted to the sustension of its life, when  full-grown, when it has to feed itself and propagate{160}. The structure  of a kitten is quite in secondary degree adapted to its habits, whilst  fed by its mother's milk and prey. Hence variation in the structure of  the full-grown species will _chiefly_ determine the preservation of a  species now become ill-suited to its habitat, or rather with a better  place opened to it in the economy of Nature. It would not matter to the  full-grown cat whether in its young state it was more or less eminently  feline, so that it become so when full-grown. No doubt most variation,  (not depending on habits of life of individual) depends on early  change{161} and we must suspect that at whatever time of life the  alteration of foetus is effected, it tends to appear at same period.  When we <see> a tendency to particular disease in old age transmitted by  the male, we know some effect is produced during conception, on the  simple cell of ovule, which will not produce its effect till half a  century afterwards and that effect is not visible{162}. So we see in  grey-hound, bull-dog, in race-horse and cart-horse, which have been  selected for their form in full-life, there is much less (?) difference  in the few first days after birth{163}, than when full-grown: so in  cattle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#14)"],[1," shut off the power.  By this time Andy had succeeded in slowing down his craft.  The young  inventor hastily looked over the side of the ARROW.  One of the rudder  fastenings had been torn loose.    \"What do you mean by running me down?\" shouted Tom angrily.    \"I--I didn't do it on purpose,\" returned Andy contritely.  \"I was  seeing how near I could come to you when my steering gear broke.  I  hope I haven't damaged you.\"    \"My rudder's broken,\" went on Tom \"and I've got to put back to repair  it.  I ought to have you arrested for this!\"    \"I'll pay for the damage,\" replied Andy, and he was so frightened that  he was white, in spite of his tan and freckles.    \"That won't do me any good now,\" retorted Tom.  \"It will delay me a  couple of hours.  If you try any tricks like that again, I'll complain  to the authorities and you won't be allowed to run a boat on this lake.\"    Andy knew that his rival was in the right and did not reply.  The bully  and his cronies busied themselves over the broken steering gear, and  the young inventor, finding that he could make a shift to get back to  his boathouse, turned his craft around and headed for there, in order  to repair the damage.          CHAPTER XIV    THE ARROW DISAPPEARS      Paying no heed to the occupants of the bully's boat, who, by reason of  their daring, had been responsible for his accident that might have  resulted seriously, Tom was soon at his dock.  He had it conveniently  arranged for hoisting craft out of the water to repair them, and in a  few minutes the stern of the ARROW was elevated so that he could get at  the rudder.    \"Well, it's not as bad as I thought,\" he remarked when, with critical  eye, he had noted the damage done.  \"I can fix it in about an hour if  Garret helps me.\"    Going up to the house to get some tools and to tell the engineer that  he had returned, Tom looked out over the lake and saw Andy's boat  moving slowly off.    \"They've got her fixed up in some kind of shape,\" he murmured.  \"It's a  shame for a chump like Andy to have a good boat like that.  He'll spoil  it in one season.  He's getting altogether too reckless.  First thing  he knows, he and I will have a clash and I'll pay back some of the old  scores.\"    Mr. Jackson was much surprised to see the young inventor home again so  soon, as was also Mrs. Baggert.  Tom explained what had happened, and  he and the engineer went to work repairing the damage done by the RED  STREAK.  As the owner of the ARROW had anticipated, the work did not  take long, and, shortly before dinner time, the boat was ready to  resume the interrupted trip to Sandport.    \"Better stay and have lunch,\" urged Mrs. Baggert.  \"You can hardly get  to the hotel by night, anyhow, and maybe it would be better not to  start until to-morrow.\"    \"No, I must get back to-night or dad would be worried,\" declared Tom.  \"I've been gone longer now than I calculated on.  But I will have  dinner here, and, if necessary, I can do the last half of the trip  after dark.  I know the way now and I have a compass and a good  searchlight.\"    The ARROW was let down into the water again and tied outside the  boathouse ready for a quick start.  The dinner Mrs. Baggert provided  was so good that Tom lingered over it longer than he meant to, and he  asked for a second apple dumpling with hard sauce on.  So it was with a  very comfortable feeling indeed and with an almost forgiving spirit  toward Andy Foger that our hero started down the path to the lake.    \"Now for a quick run to Sandport,\" he said aloud.  \"I hope I shan't see  any more of those men and that dad hasn't been bothered by them.  His  suspicions about the house weren't altogether unfounded, for I did see  the tramp and some one else sneaking around, but I don't believe  they'll come back now.\"    Tom swung around the path that led to the dock.  As he came in sight of  the water, he stared as if he could not believe what he saw, or,  rather, what he did not see.  For there was no craft tied to the  string-piece, where he had fastened his motor-boat.  He looked again,  rubbed his eyes to make sure and then cried out:    \"The ARROW is gone!\"    There was no doubt of it.  The craft was not at the dock.  Breaking  into a run, Tom hastened to the boathouse.  The ARROW was not in there,  and a look across the lake showed only a few rowboats in sight.    \"That's mighty funny,\" mused the youth.  \"I wonder--\"    He paused suddenly in his thoughts.    \"Maybe Garret took it out to try and see that it worked all right,\" he  said hopefully.  \"He knows how to run a boat.  Maybe he wanted to see  how the rudder behaved and is out in it now.  He got through dinner  before I did.  But I should have thought he'd have said something to me  if he was going out in it.\"    This was the one weak point in Tom's theory, and he felt it at once.    \"I'll see if Garret is in his shop,\" he went on as he turned back  toward the house.    The first person he met as he headed for the group of small structures  where Mr. Swift's inventive work was carried on was Garret Jackson, the  engineer.    \"I--I thought you were out in my boat!\" stammered Tom.    \"Your boat!  Why would I be out in your boat?\" and Mr. Jackson removed  his pipe from his mouth and stared at the young inventor.    \"Because it's gone!\"    \"Gone!\" repeated the engineer, and then Tom told him.  The two hurried  down to the dock, but the addition of another pair of eyes was of no  assistance in locating the ARROW.  The trim little motor craft was  nowhere to be seen.    \"I can't understand it,\" said Tom helplessly.  \"I wasn't gone more than  an hour at dinner, and yet--\"    \"It doesn't take long to steal a motor-boat,\" commented the engineer.    \"But I think I would have heard them start it,\" went on the lad.  \"Maybe it drifted off, though I'm sure I tied it securely.\"    \"No, there's not much likelihood of that.  There's no wind to-day and  no currents in the lake.  But it could easily have been towed off by  some one in a rowboat and then you would not have heard the motor  start.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed the youth.  \"That's probably how they did it.  They  sneaked up here in a rowboat and towed the ARROW off.  I'm sure of it.\"    \"And I'll wager I know who did it,\" exclaimed Mr. Jackson energetically.    \"Who?\" demanded Tom quickly.    \"Those men who were sneaking around--Happy Harry and his gang.  They  stole the boat once and they'd do it again.  Those men took your boat,  Tom.\"    The young inventor shook his head.    \"No,\" he answered, \"I don't believe they did.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Well, because they wouldn't dare come back here when they knew we're  on the lookout for them.  It would be too risky.\"    \"Oh, those fellows don't care for risk,\" was the opinion of Mr.  Jackson.  \"Take my word for it, they have your boat.  They have been  keeping watch, and as soon as they saw the dock unprotected they  sneaked up and stole the ARROW.\"    \"I don't think so,\" repeated Mr. Swift's son.    \"Who do you think took it then?\"    \"Andy Foger!\" was the quick response.  \"I believe he and his cronies  did it to annoy me.  They have been trying to get even with me-or at  least Andy has--for outbidding him on this boat.  He's tried several  times, but he hasn't succeeded--until now.  I'm sure Andy Foger has my  boat,\" and Tom, with a grim tightening of his lips, swung around as  though to start in instant pursuit.    \"Where are you going?\" asked Mr. Jackson.    \"To find Andy and his cronies.  When I locate them I'll make them tell  me where my boat is.\"    \"Hadn't you better send some word to your father?  You can hardly get  to Sandport now, and he'll be worried about you.\"    \"That's so, I will.  I'll telephone dad that the boat--no, I'll not do  that either, for he'd only worry and maybe get sick.  I'll just tell  him I've had a little accident, that Andy ran into me and that I can't  come back to the hotel for a day or two.  Maybe I'll be lucky to find  my boat in that time.  But dad won't worry then, and, when I see him, I  can explain.  That's what I'll do,\" and Tom was soon talking to Mr.  Swift by telephone.    The inventor was very sorry his son could not come back to rejoin him  and Ned, but there was no help for it, and, with as cheerful voice as  he could assume, the lad promised to start for Sandport at the earliest  opportunity.    \"Now to find Andy and my boat!\" Tom exclaimed as he hung up the  telephone receiver.          CHAPTER XV    A DISMAYING STATEMENT      Trouble is sometimes good in a way; it makes a person resourceful.  Tom  Swift had had his share of annoyances of late, but they had served a  purpose.  He had learned to think clearly and quickly.  Now, when he  found his boat stolen, he at once began to map out a plan of action.    \"What will you do first?\" asked Mr. Jackson as he saw his employer's  son hesitating.    \"First I'm going to Andy Foger's house,\" declared the young inventor.  \"If he's home I'm going to tell him what I think of him.  If he's not,  I'm going to find him.\"    \"Why don't you take your sailboat and run down to his dock?\" suggested  the engineer.  \"It isn't as quick as your motor-boat, but it's better  than walking.\"    \"So it is,\" exclaimed the lad.  \"I will use my catboat.  I had  forgotten all about it of late.  I'm glad you spoke.\"    He was soon sailing down the lake in the direction of the boathouse on  the waterfront of Mr. Foger's property.  It needed but a glance around  the dock to show him that the RED STREAK was not there, but Tom  recollected the accident to the steering gear and thought perhaps Andy  had taken his boat to some wharf where there was a repair shop and  there left it to return home himself.  But inquiry of Mrs. Foger, who  was as nice a woman as her son was a mean lad, gave Tom the information  that his enemy was not at home.    \"He telephoned to me that his boat was damaged,\" said Mrs. Foger  gently, \"and that he had taken it to get fixed.  Then, he said, he "]]]
