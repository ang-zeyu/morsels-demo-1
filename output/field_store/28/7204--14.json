Macaroni wheat has a very hard kernel and is rich in gluten. It is used  mainly in the manufacture of macaroni paste, but in Europe, when mixed  with three times its weight of ordinary soft wheat, it is much used in  making flour. The small amount now grown in the United States is shipped  mainly to France.    The yield of wheat varies partly with the rainfall, but the difference  is due mainly to skill in cultivation. In western Europe it is from two  to three times as great as in the United States; in Russia and India it  is much less.[28]    The yearly consumption of wheat is increasing very rapidly both in the  United States and in Europe; moreover, China is becoming a  wheat-consuming country. In the United States the consumption is  increasing so rapidly that unless either the acreage of the crop, or  else the yield per acre, is materially increased, there will be no  surplus for export after the year 1931.    [Illustration: THE WHEAT INDUSTRY--GRAIN ELEVATORS AT BUFFALO, NEW  YORK]    In the United States the acreage may be somewhat increased by the  irrigation of arid lands now uncultivated, and by the reclamation of  overflowed and swamp lands. There are far greater possibilities,  however, in the employment of methods of cultivation which will double  the rate of present yield. It is doubtful if there can be much increase  of acreage in the States of the Mississippi Valley, where the acreage  will of necessity be lessened rather than increased.    In western Europe there can be no material increase of the acreage or  the rate of yield; in Russia both are possible. The plains of Argentina  now yield a notable quantity--about one hundred million bushels--and the  amount may be increased. Moreover, a large product may be obtained from  both Uruguay and Paraguay, and southern Brazil, neither one of which  produces a considerable quantity. At the present rate of the increase in  consumption, all of the available land, yielding its maximum, will not  produce a sufficient crop at the end of the twentieth century.    =Corn.=--Maize or Indian corn is the seed of a plant, _Zea mays_, a member  of the grass family. It is not known to exist in a wild state. The  species now cultivated are undoubtedly derived from the American  continent, but evidence is not wanting to show that it was known in  China and the islands of Asia before the discovery of America.[29] The  commercial history of corn begins with the discovery of America. Next to  meat it was the chief food of the native American; next to wheat it is  the chief food-stuff in the American continent to-day.    Corn requires a rich soil and is not so hardy as wheat. It thrives best  in regions having long summers and warm nights. The growing crop is  easily injured by too much rain. It is an abundant crop in the central  Mississippi Valley, but not near the coast; it is very prolific in  Nebraska, but not in Dakota; it thrives in Italy, Austria, and the  Balkan Peninsula, but not in the British Isles and Germany. It is a very  important crop in Australia, and is the staple grain of Mexico. It is  the crop of fourteen-hour days and warm nights.    [Illustration: CORN]    The United States is the chief producer of corn, and from an area of  80,000,000 acres--about that of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois  combined--more than two billion bushels, or four-fifths of the world's  crop, are produced. In the past few years the area planted with corn has  not materially increased, and it is likely to be lessened rather than  increased in the future. From the same acreage, however, the annual  yield, now about twenty-five or thirty bushels per acre, can be more  than doubled by the use of more skilful methods of cultivation.    Corn contains more fatty substance, or natural oil, than wheat, and  therefore has a greater heating power. For this reason it is better than  wheat for out-of-door workers, and it is almost the only cereal  food-stuff consumed in Spanish America. It is also a staple food-stuff  in Egypt. Corn has been used as a bread-stuff in the United States,  Italy, and Rumania[30] for a long time. In recent years, however, its  use has become very popular in Europe.    [Illustration: CORN PRODUCTION]    In the United States by far the greater part of the crop is consumed  where it is grown, being used to fatten swine and cattle. The market  value of a pound of corn is about one-third of a cent; converted into  pork or beef, however, it is worth five or six times as much. By feeding  the corn to stock, therefore, a farmer may turn an unmarketable product  into one for which there is a steady demand.    [Illustration: CORN]    Although corn is not so essential a staple as wheat, it has a much wider  range of usefulness. The starch made from it is considered a delicacy  and is used very largely in America and Europe as an article of food.  Glucose, a cheap but wholesome substitute for sugar, is made from it;  from the oil a substitute for rubber is prepared; smokeless powder and  other explosives are made from the pith of the stalk; while a very  large part of the product is used in the manufacture of liquor.    =Rye.=--Rye is the seed of a cereal grass, _Secale cereale_, a plant  closely resembling wheat in external appearance. Rye will grow in soils  that are too poor for wheat; its northern limit is in latitudes somewhat  greater than that of wheat, also. It is an ideal crop for the sandy  plain stretching from the Netherlands into central Russia, and this  locality produces almost the whole yield. The world's crop is about one  and a half billion bushels, of which Russia produces nearly two-thirds.  Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Japan grow nearly all the rest. It is  consumed where it is grown. In the United States the yearly product is  about twenty-five million bushels, about one-tenth of which is exported  to Europe. Rye-bread is almost always sour, and this fact is its chief  disadvantage.    =Barley.=--Barley is the seed of several species of cereal grass, mainly  _Hordeum distichum_ and _Hordeum vulgare_. It is one of the oldest-used  of bread-stuffs. It can be cultivated farther north than wheat, and  about as far within the tropics as corn; it has, therefore, very wide  limits. Formerly it was much used in northwestern Europe as a  bread-stuff, but in recent years it has been in part supplanted by wheat  and corn. Barley is a most excellent food for horses, and in California  is grown mainly for this purpose. Its chief use is for the manufacture  of the malt used in brewing.    The world's crop of barley is not far from one billion bushels, of which  the United States produces about sixty million bushels. Most of the crop  is grown in the Germanic states of Europe, and in Russia.    =Oats.=--The oat is the seed of a cereal grass, _Avena sativa_ being the  species almost always cultivated. It is not known where the cultivated  species originated, but the earliest known locality is central Europe,  where it was certainly a domestic plant during the Bronze Age. It seems  probable that the species now cultivated in Scotland at one time grew  wild in western Europe; certain it is that wild species are found in  North America.    [Illustration: OATS PRODUCTION]    The oat grows within rather wider limits of latitude, and thrives in a  greater variety of soils than does wheat. Grown in a moist climate,  however, the grain is at its best. The oat-crop of the world aggregates  more than three billion bushels, surpassing that of wheat or corn in  measurement, but not in weight. A small portion of this is used as a  bread-stuff, but the greater part is used as horse-food, for which it is  remarkably adapted.    [Illustration: OATS]    In Europe, Russia is the greatest producer, and its yearly oat harvest  is about one-quarter of the world's crop. The states of northwestern  Europe yield about half the entire crop; the wheat-growing area of the  United States produces the remaining one-fourth. Russia and the United  States are both exporters, the grain going to western Europe. By far the  greater part of the grain is consumed where it is grown.    =Rice.=--Rice is the seed of a cereal grass, _Oryza sativa_. It is claimed  to be native to India, but it is known to have been cultivated in China  for more than five thousand years. It grows wild in Australia and  Malaysia.    Rice requires plenty of warmth and moisture. It is cultivated in the  warmer parts of the temperate zone, but it thrives best in the tropical  regions. In China a considerable upland rice is grown, but for the  greater part it is grown in level lowlands that may be flooded with  water. The preparation of the fields is a matter of great expense, for  they may require flooding and draining at a moment's notice. The crop  matures in from three to six months. After threshing, the seed is still  covered with a husk, and in this form it is known as \"paddy.\"      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    Why is not wheat-growing a profitable industry in the New England  States?--in the plains at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains?--in  the southern part of the United States?    What are meant by the following terms: No. 1 spring, a corner, a disk  harrow, a cradle, a flail, a separator, futures, warehouse certificates?    In 1855 the price of a barrel of flour in New York or Boston was about  twelve dollars; at the close of the century it was less than five.  Explain how the lessened price came about.    From a census or other report make a list of the ten leading  wheat-producing States; the ten that produce the most corn.    Why are the foreign shipments of oats less than those of wheat?    What are the prices current of wheat, corn, oats, and barley to-day?      FOR STUDY AND REFERENCE    Obtain samples of the different kinds of wheat, oats, barley, corn,  millet, and rice.

We  understand that these splendid dissertations will be given to the public  in the more acceptable form of a volume. The popular lecture is not a  suitable medium for such discussions, or certainly not for such  thinking: one of Mr. James's sentences, diluted to the lecture standard,  would serve for an entire discourse, which by those who should  understand it, would be deemed of a singularly compact body, as compared  with the average of such performances.           *       *       *       *       *    PROFESSOR TORREY, of the University of Vermont, is one of the few  contemporary scholars, whose names are likely to survive with those of  the great teachers of past ages. He has translated Schilling's Discourse  on Fine Arts, and other shorter compositions from the German; but his  chief labor in this way is, a most laborious and admirably executed  version of Neander's History of the Christian Religion and Church,  published in Boston, and now being republished in London, by Bonn, with  Notes, &c., by the Rev. A. T. W. Morison, of Trinity College, Cambridge.    Neander has sometimes been called, but with scarcely sufficient reason,  the Niebuhr of ecclesiastical history. The only point in which he  resembles the historian of Rome, is in that vast range of complete  erudition which makes the Past in its minutest details as familiar as  the Present, which is never content with derivative information, but  traces back every tributary of the great stream of History to its  remotest accessible source. In this respect the two eminent historians  were alike, but with this point of resemblance the similarity ends.  Neander is entirely free from that necessity under which Niebuhr  labored, of regarding every recorded aggregate of facts as a mass of  error which the modern philosophy of history was either to decompose  into a myth, or reconstruct into a new form more consistent with  preconceived theory.           *       *       *       *       *    The Works of JOHN C. CALHOUN will soon, through the wise munificence of  the state of South Carolina, be accessible by the students of political  philosophy and history in a complete and suitable edition, with such  memoirs as are necessary for their illustration, and for the  satisfaction of the natural curiosity respecting their illustrious  author. The first volume will comprise Mr. Calhoun's elaborate  _Disquisition on Government, and a Discourse on the Constitution and  Government of the United States_, in which are displayed in a systematic  manner the author's opinions upon the whole subject of the philosophy of  government. These treatises were begun many years ago, and though they  had not received the ultimate revision which was intended, they are very  complete, and by the careful and judicious editing of Mr. Cralle, his  intimate friend and confidential secretary, will perhaps appear as  perfect in all their parts as if re-written by Mr. Calhoun himself.  These are now nearly stereotyped; and to correct some misapprehensions  which seem to prevail in South Carolina, we state that only the  stereotype plates are made in New-York, there being no foundries for  stereotyping in Charleston, where the book will be printed and  published. For this purpose the Legislature has appropriated $10,000,  which will meet the expenses for fifteen thousand copies of the first  volume, all but five hundred of which, printed on large paper, for  public libraries, will be sold for the benefit of Mr. Calhoun's family.  Another volume will contain Mr. Calhoun's official papers, and another  his Letters upon Public Affairs. This, we think, will be the most  interesting of the series. Mr. Calhoun wrote always with sincerity and  frankness, and his communications to his friends contain, much more than  his speeches and state papers, the exhibitions of his feeling, his  regrets, fears, expectations, and ambitions. His speeches will probably  make three volumes; the collection formerly printed by the Harpers did  not embrace half of them; many of them have never been printed at all,  but (particularly some of his most elaborate performances previous to  1817) exist in carefully prepared manuscript reports. All these speeches  will be revised and illustrated by Mr. Cralle: and the series will be  completed with the memoirs of the great senator, for which that  gentleman has the most ample and interesting materials.           *       *       *       *       *    ARCHBISHOP WHATELEY'S very ingenious _Historical Doubts Respecting  Napoleon Bonaparte_, is the cleverest book of the kind yet written, not  excepting the high church pamphlet treating of the Archbishop's own  existence in the same way. But the idea was not original with Whateley:  Mr. William Biglow of Boston wrote half a century ago, _The Age of  Freedom, being an Investigation of Good and Bad Government, in Imitation  of Mr. Paine's Age of Reason_, and intended, by a similar style of  argument respecting the Discovery of America, &c., to expose that  infidel's sophistries. We perceive that the _Life of Jesus_, by Dr.  Strauss, has been met by another such performance in England, under the  title of _Historical Certainties respecting the Early History of  America, developed in a Critical Examination of the Book of the  Chronicles of the Land of Ecnarf; By the Rev. Aristarchus Newlight,  Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Giessen, Corresponding Member  of the Theophilanthropic and Pantisocratical Societies of Leipsig, late  Professor of all Religions in several distinguished Academies at Home  and Abroad, &c_. The author very satisfactorily disposes of the events  between the first French Revolution and the Battle of Waterloo, by  putting them through the \"mythic\" circle invented by Dr. Strauss. The  joke is carried out with remarkable ingenuity, and with the most  whimsical resources of learning. The good doctor finds, _a la Strauss, a  nucleus_, for here and there a great tradition, but remorselessly wipes  out as altogether incredible many of the most striking and familiar  facts in modern history.           *       *       *       *       *    Of Mr. SCHOOLCRAFT'S great work, which we have heretofore announced, the  first part has just appeared from the press of Lippencott, Grambo & Co.,  in the most splendid quarto volume that has yet been printed in America.  We shall take an early opportunity to do justice to this truly national  performance and to its author.           *       *       *       *       *    DR. ROBERT KNOX--whose book of infidel rigmarole, _The Races of Men_,  was lately reprinted by an American house which was never before and we  trust will never again be guilty of such an indiscretion,--we understand  is coming to New-York to lecture upon Ethnology. He has the \"gift\" of  talking, and is said to have been popular as a demonstrator in anatomy;  but we think it will be best for him to remain a while longer in  England; the sham science of which his last book is a specimen is no  longer, we believe, _profitable_ in this country. The last _Princeton  Review_ says of _The Races of Men_:         \"This book is fairly beneath argument or criticism. It is a       curious medley of vanity, ignorance, malice, and fanaticism. At       first it provoked our indignation, by the boldness and       effrontery of its pretensions; but their very extravagance soon       began to render them comical. It claims to originate views       which are to overturn 'long received doctrines, national       prejudices, stereotyped delusions,' &c., while any tolerable       scholar in this department is perfectly familiar with them all       in the works of Virey, Courtet, Bory de St. Vincent, Edwards,       La Marck, Quetelet, &c. It has not the slightest claim to       originality, except for the ridiculous ingenuity, with which it       carries out the more cautious follies of these infidel       philosophers, into the most glaring absurdities; and sets their       ingenious physiological speculations, in broad contradiction to       the most authentic and unquestioned truths of history. We       certainly should not have noticed this thing at all, but for       two reasons. In the first place, this subject is now rendered       so interesting by the important bearings of modern ethnological       researches, that some of our readers might be cheated by the       mere title, and by newspaper puffs, out of the market price for       the book; and in the second place, we wish to express our       surprise and lift up our remonstrance against such issues from       a quarter so respectable as that which has given this reprint       to the American public. Whatever may be the social or       scientific standing of any influential publishing house, we       must say, that in our judgment they merit a deliberate rebuke       from the true science of the country, for reprinting so crude       and wretched a performance, to say nothing of the low malignity       which it vents against the Christian sentiment and enterprise       of an age like the present,--and even against men, who stand in       the front ranks of science, because they happen to believe that       the scriptures are entitled to some respect, as authentic       records; or that other races of men are capable of being       Christianized, beside the Teutonic. Cuvier was an ignorant and       stubborn dogmatist, whose era is now past for ever. Buckland       was an ingenious priest and Jesuit; and even Newton's brain was       turned by chronology.\"           *       *       *       *       *    MR.
