This burial-ground is a system of sheltered colonnades, where the dead  are deposited in sarcophagi, resting on shelves on the inner walls, tier  upon tier. Only the very poor people seem to be buried in the _common  earth_, in the open spaces which lie before the colonnades, and these  are crowded. It rather shocked us to see the gravedigger remove some  bones from the ground and throw them into a kind of bin, which was there  for the purpose, in order to make room for a new corpse. I thought, with  Hamlet--        \"Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats      with them? Mine ache to think on't.\"    The colonnades are paved with marble, and are scrupulously clean. Some  have exquisite monuments and statuary, the figures most eloquently  expressive of tender feelings of both joy and sorrow. The draperies and  lacework are wonderfully real. One we thought especially beautiful. The  bereaved mourners are reluctant to part with their beloved relative and  endeavour to detain him, but an angel gently leads him away; and he,  though expressing love and sympathy for his friends, gladly follows his  winged guide to a happier world above. Another portrays a little girl,  tripping joyfully out from the tomb, over roses and other blossoming  flowers. There are hundreds of others, full of deep pathos, works of  Italy's greatest sculptors.    One tomb is said to have cost some L5000. The patriot Mazzini is buried  here. At the highest point of the cemetery is a rotunda chapel, with  very fine statuary of Moses and the prophets, Adam and Eve, and many  other subjects.    There is an echo in this chapel that is wonderfully and unusually clear  and distinct.    The shops at Genoa are small but handsomely furnished. The Genoese  jewellery is very beautiful, particularly the gold and silver filagree  work. We were surprised to learn that the gold so-called is only silver  twice gilt.    The postal arrangements here are very convenient. By leaving your  address at the poste restante, you have all your letters sent to you at  the hotel without delay. There is a nice sheltered colonnade, a kind of  Burlington Arcade, running half-way up at the back of the Via Roma,  where the Hotel Isotta is situated, and close to the post-office; but on  a rainy day, the noise made by those talking and promenading there is  somewhat of a nuisance to visitors in the hotel. A very favourite  promenade--indeed, the best in Genoa--is that before mentioned, in front  of the harbour, but only when shaded from the heat of the sun, as the  glare of its rays on the white marble is scarcely to be borne. Here in  the evenings, when fine, the ladies of Genoa are seen to advantage, with  their charming dress at once so elegant, modest, and becoming. English  women might well take a few hints from its simplicity. These ladies are  mostly handsome, and their movements are exceedingly graceful.    Here and there among the houses you sometimes see between two windows a  painting simulating a third window half open, with perhaps a lady  looking out into the street below, and this is so natural, that for the  moment you fancy it is real. The houses are mostly six stories high, and  the shops and lower apartments are consequently extremely gloomy. The  upper rooms are the most suitable to dwell in, but visitors frequently  find it exceedingly fatiguing to toil up and down the stairs; and some  of the stone-paved passages, miscalled streets, are almost  perpendicular. Altogether, one needs extraordinary strength in this city  of precipices. It is thus very unsuitable to invalids, apart from its  variable climate. It is subject to very rapid changes of temperature,  warm winds from the south alternating constantly with dry cold winds  from the north, which render it very trying to delicate people.    The weather was so very cold during our visit, that, despite the great  interest with which Genoa inspired us, we were glad to leave it for  Pisa, which we understood would be milder. We had intended going hence  to Milan, Florence, and Venice, but the cold warned us not to go further  north; and we therefore altered our plans, and left Genoa on the 9th of  January for Pisa, _en route_ for Rome.

We arrived at Pisa towards evening, and got into comfortable quarters at  the Hotel Victoria, a quiet house, reminding us of the Swiss hotels in  its style of entertainment. We soon had a nice little dinner set before  us, and were hungry enough to do justice to it.    The next morning we found to our great disgust that it rained heavily.  Our hotel was close to the river Arno, the river of Dante and Petrarch.  It looked sandy and muddy as it flowed rapidly by. There were several  gondola-like barges being towed by ropes on the other side, and  Shelley's lines occurred to my memory, more in association of the poet  with the place, than from the poetical look of the river itself--        \"Within the surface of the fleeting river        The wrinkled image of the city lay      Immovably unquiet, and for ever        It trembles, but never fades away.\"    It is impossible to visit Pisa without recalling touching memories of  the unfortunate and gifted poet who passed the last few years of his  stormy life here, and only left it in the summer of 1823 for the Casa  Magni, on the wild sea coast between Lerici and San Terenzio. It was  from here that the _Don Juan_ set out on its fatal trip to Leghorn one  July morning--never to return.    Pisa is another very ancient city. It was founded about six centuries  B.C., and was one of the twelve Etruscan cities. Like Genoa, it  underwent many changes and vicissitudes, one of the greatest of which  was the unexpected receding of the sea for some three or four miles,  changing it from a busy, prosperous port to a comparatively unimportant  inland town. It is still, however, much respected on account of its  ancient greatness and learning, and is generally looked upon as the  cradle of Italian art. In these latter days it is again becoming wealthy  and enterprising. It is considered a remarkably good place for  consumptive invalids. A fellow-traveller informed me that a friend of  his had lived here for many years with _both lungs gone_! The climate is  exceedingly mild, almost humid from the quantity of rain that falls:  there is said to be, on an average, seventy-three days of rain, and one  of snow, between October and April. We remained there only two days, and  it rained almost incessantly during the whole time; the place looking  very miserable under the circumstances. However, the inhabitants  appeared quite used to it, and walked about unconcernedly enough, with  their _green_ umbrellas, evidencing at least some sunny days in the  past.    The busiest part of the town is the Lung 'Arno (Street along the Arno),  a broad, handsome quay extending down both banks of the river. The  houses here are very imposing; one, in particular, is fronted with  marble so exquisitely smooth and pure it might serve as a looking-glass.    Fortunately for visitors, most of the objects of interest are  concentrated in one spot--a large square some ten minutes' walk from our  hotel. The streets we passed through on our way thither were very  quaint, the overhanging shops and cloistered pavements reminding us much  of Chester. On the way we visited San Stefano di Cavalier, the church of  the Knights of the Order of St. Stephen, and were much interested in the  number of flags--Turkish trophies captured from the Moslem by the  valiant Knights Crusaders. There were also some beautiful ceiling  paintings of the battle of Lepanto, and other subjects.    On reaching the Piazza del Duomo, we found the four chief objects of  interest we had come to seek. Forsyth pithily observes, \"Pisa, while the  capital of a republic, was celebrated for its profusion of marble, its  patrician tower, and its grave magnificence. It can still boast some  marble churches, a marble palace, and a marble bridge. Its towers,  though no longer a mark of nobility, may be traced in the walls of  modernized houses. Its gravity pervades every street, but its  magnificence is now confined to one sacred corner. There stands the  Cathedral, the Baptistery, the Leaning Tower, and the Campo Santo, all  built of the same white marble, all varieties of the same architecture,  all venerable with years, and fortunate both in their society and their  solitude.\"    The Cathedral is indeed very fine; the columns, arches, and carvings are  curiously beautiful. It was built by the Pisans after their great naval  victory in 1063, and is, I think, the finest specimen now existing of  the style called by the Italians the Gotico-Moresco. Baedeker says,  \"This remarkably perfect edifice is constructed entirely of white  marble, with black and coloured ornamentation. The most magnificent part  is the facade, which in the lower storey is adorned with columns and  arches attached to the wall; in the upper parts with four open  galleries, gradually diminishing in length: the choir is also imposing.  The ancient bronze gates were replaced in 1602 by the present doors,  with representations of scriptural subjects, executed by Mocchi, Tacca,  Mora, and others from designs by Giovanni da Bologna.\" The interior is  upborne by sixty-eight ancient Greek and Roman columns, captured by the  Pisans in war. The nave, transept, and dome are most beautifully  decorated with paintings, frescoes, and sculpture by Italy's greatest  master, of whom Ariosto truly says--        \"_Michael, piu che mortal, angel divino._\"      (Michael,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#14)"],[1,"ght,  All so distinct, and all so white!    II    Winter! The peasant blithely goes  To labour in his sledge forgot,  His pony sniffing the fresh snows  Just manages a feeble trot  Though deep he sinks into the drift;  Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,(48)  Its driver seated on the rim  In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;  Yonder the household lad doth run,  Placed in a sledge his terrier black,  Himself transformed into a hack;  To freeze his finger hath begun,  He laughs, although it aches from cold,  His mother from the door doth scold.    [Note 48: The \"kibitka,\" properly speaking, whether on wheels  or runners, is a vehicle with a hood not unlike a big cradle.]    III    In scenes like these it may be though,  Ye feel but little interest,  They are all natural and low,  Are not with elegance impressed.  Another bard with art divine  Hath pictured in his gorgeous line  The first appearance of the snows  And all the joys which Winter knows.  He will delight you, I am sure,  When he in ardent verse portrays  Secret excursions made in sleighs;  But competition I abjure  Either with him or thee in song,  Bard of the Finnish maiden young.(49)    [Note 49: The allusions in the foregoing stanza are in the first  place to a poem entitled \"The First Snow,\" by Prince Viazemski  and secondly to \"Eda,\" by Baratynski, a poem descriptive of life  in Finland.]    IV    Tattiana, Russian to the core,  Herself not knowing well the reason,  The Russian winter did adore  And the cold beauties of the season:  On sunny days the glistening rime,  Sledging, the snows, which at the time  Of sunset glow with rosy light,  The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.  These evenings as in days of old  The Larinas would celebrate,  The servants used to congregate  And the young ladies fortunes told,  And every year distributed  Journeys and warriors to wed.    V    Tattiana in traditions old  Believed, the people's wisdom weird,  In dreams and what the moon foretold  And what she from the cards inferred.  Omens inspired her soul with fear,  Mysteriously all objects near  A hidden meaning could impart,  Presentiments oppressed her heart.  Lo! the prim cat upon the stove  With one paw strokes her face and purrs,  Tattiana certainly infers  That guests approach: and when above  The new moon's crescent slim she spied,  Suddenly to the left hand side,    VI    She trembled and grew deadly pale.  Or a swift meteor, may be,  Across the gloom of heaven would sail  And disappear in space; then she  Would haste in agitation dire  To mutter her concealed desire  Ere the bright messenger had set.  When in her walks abroad she met  A friar black approaching near,(50)  Or a swift hare from mead to mead  Had run across her path at speed,  Wholly beside herself with fear,  Anticipating woe she pined,  Certain misfortune near opined.    [Note 50: The Russian clergy are divided into two classes:  the white or secular, which is made up of the mass of parish  priests, and the black who inhabit the monasteries, furnish  the high dignitaries of the Church, and constitute that swarm  of useless drones for whom Peter the Great felt such a deep  repugnance.]    VII    Wherefore? She found a secret joy  In horror for itself alone,  Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,  Thus her perversity hath shown.  Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!(51)  When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,  Before whose inexperienced sight  Life lies extended, vast and bright,  To peer into the future tries.  Old age through spectacles too peers,  Although the destined coffin nears,  Having lost all in life we prize.  It matters not. Hope e'en to these  With childlike lisp will lie to please.    [Note 51: Refers to the \"Sviatki\" or Holy Nights between Christmas  Eve and Twelfth Night. Divination, or the telling of fortunes  by various expedients, is the favourite pastime on these  occasions.]    VIII    Tattiana gazed with curious eye  On melted wax in water poured;  The clue unto some mystery  She deemed its outline might afford.  Rings from a dish of water full  In order due the maidens pull;  But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en  A ring she heard the ancient strain:  _The peasants there are rich as kings,  They shovel silver with a spade,  He whom we sing to shall be made  Happy and glorious_. But this brings  With sad refrain misfortune near.  Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.(52)    [Note 52: During the \"sviatki\" it is a common custom for the girls  to assemble around a table on which is placed a dish or basin of  water which contains a ring. Each in her turn extracts the ring  from the basin whilst the remainder sing in chorus the \"podbliudni  pessni,\" or \"dish songs\" before mentioned. These are popularly  supposed to indicate the fortunes of the immediate holder of the  ring. The first-named lines foreshadow death; the latter, the  \"kashourka,\" or \"kitten song,\" indicates approaching marriage. It  commences thus: \"The cat asked the kitten to sleep on the stove.\"]    IX    Frosty the night; the heavens shone;  The wondrous host of heavenly spheres  Sailed silently in unison--  Tattiana in the yard appears  In a half-open dressing-gown  And bends her mirror on the moon,  But trembling on the mirror dark  The sad moon only could remark.  List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!  The girl on tiptoe forward bounds  And her voice sweeter than the sounds  Of clarinet or flute doth cry:  \"What is your name?\" The boor looked dazed,  And \"Agathon\" replied, amazed.(53)    [Note 53: The superstition is that the name of the future husband  may thus be discovered.]    X    Tattiana (nurse the project planned)  By night prepared for sorcery,  And in the bathroom did command  To lay two covers secretly.  But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,  And I, remembering Svetlana,(54)  Become alarmed. So never mind!  I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.  So she her silken sash unlaced,  Undressed herself and went to bed  And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.(55)  Beneath her downy pillow placed,  A little virgin mirror peeps.  'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.    [Note 54: See Note 30.]    [Note 55: Lel, in Slavonic mythology, corresponds to the Morpheus  of the Latins. The word is evidently connected with the verb  \"leleyat\" to fondle or soothe, likewise with our own word  \"to lull.\"]    XI    A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.  She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field  All covered up with snow in heaps,  By melancholy fogs concealed.  Amid the snowdrifts which surround  A stream, by winter's ice unbound,  Impetuously clove its way  With boiling torrent dark and gray;  Two poles together glued by ice,  A fragile bridge and insecure,  Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;  Beside the thundering abyss  Tattiana in despair unfeigned  Rooted unto the spot remained.    XII    As if against obstruction sore  Tattiana o'er the stream complained;  To help her to the other shore  No one appeared to lend a hand.  But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,  And what from its recess appears?  A bristly bear of monstrous size!  He roars, and \"Ah!\" Tattiana cries.  He offers her his murderous paw;  She nerves herself from her alarm  And leans upon the monster's arm,  With footsteps tremulous with awe  Passes the torrent But alack!  Bruin is marching at her back!    XIII    She, to turn back her eyes afraid,  Accelerates her hasty pace,  But cannot anyhow evade  Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.  The bear rolls on with many a grunt:  A forest now she sees in front  With fir-trees standing motionless  In melancholy loveliness,  Their branches by the snow bowed down.  Through aspens, limes and birches bare,  The shining orbs of night appear;  There is no path; the storm hath strewn  Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,  And all in snow is buried deep.    XIV    The wood she enters--bear behind,--  In snow she sinks up to the knee;  Now a long branch itself entwined  Around her neck, now violently  Away her golden earrings tore;  Now the sweet little shoes she wore,  Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;  Her handkerchief she loses now;  No time to pick it up! afraid,  She hears the bear behind her press,  Nor dares the skirting of her dress  For shame lift up the modest maid.  She runs, the bear upon her trail,  Until her powers of running fail.    XV    She sank upon the snow. But Bruin  Adroitly seized and carried her;  Submissive as if in a swoon,  She cannot draw a breath or stir.  He dragged her by a forest road  Till amid trees a hovel showed,  By barren snow heaped up and bound,  A tangled wilderness around.  Bright blazed the window of the place,  Within resounded shriek and shout:  \"My chum lives here,\" Bruin grunts out.  \"Warm yourself here a little space!\"  Straight for the entrance then he made  And her upon the threshold laid.    XVI    Recovering, Tania gazes round;  Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;  Inside clink glasses, cries resound  As if it were some funeral feast.  But deeming all this nonsense pure,  She peeped through a chink of the door.  What doth she see? Around the board  Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.  A canine face with horns thereon,  Another with cock's head appeared,  Here an old witch with hirsute beard,  There an imperious skeleton;  A dwarf adorned with tail, again  A shape half cat and half a crane.    XVII    Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,  A crab upon a spider rides,  Perched on a goose's neck a skull  In scarlet cap revolving glides.  A windmill too a jig performs  And wildly waves its arms and storms;  Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,  The speech of man and tramp of horse.  But wide Tattiana oped her eyes  When in that company she saw  Him who inspired both love and awe,  The hero we immortalize.  Oneguine sat the table by  And viewed the door with cunning eye.    XVIII    All bustle when he makes a sign:  He drinks, all drink and loudly call;  He smiles, in laughter all combine;  He knits his brows--'tis silent all.  He there is master--that is plain;  Tattiana courage doth"]]]
