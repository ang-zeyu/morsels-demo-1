The  boy may lose his way. He may be killed.\"    \"Go, Mr. Eager,\" said Miss Bartlett, \"don't ask our driver; our driver is  no help. Go and support poor Mr. Beebe--, he is nearly demented.\"    \"He may be killed!\" cried the old man. \"He may be killed!\"    \"Typical behaviour,\" said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage. \"In  the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.\"    \"What does he know?\" whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.  \"Charlotte, how much does Mr. Eager know?\"    \"Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing. But--\" she pointed at the  driver-\"HE knows everything. Dearest, had we better? Shall I?\" She took  out her purse. \"It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.  He saw it all.\" Tapping Phaethon's back with her guide-book, she said,  \"Silenzio!\" and offered him a franc.    \"Va bene,\" he replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his day  as any. But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.    There was an explosion up the road. The storm had struck the overhead  wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen. If they  had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt. They chose to regard  it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,  which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. They descended  from the carriages; they embraced each other. It was as joyful to be  forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. For a moment they  realized vast possibilities of good.    The older people recovered quickly. In the very height of their emotion  they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. Miss Lavish calculated that,  even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the  accident. Mr. Eager mumbled a temperate prayer. But the drivers, through  miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the  saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.    \"Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me. Kiss me again. Only you can  understand me. You warned me to be careful. And I--I thought I was  developing.\"    \"Do not cry, dearest. Take your time.\"    \"I have been obstinate and silly--worse than you know, far worse. Once  by the river--Oh, but he isn't killed--he wouldn't be killed, would he?\"    The thought disturbed her repentance. As a matter of fact, the storm was  worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought  it must be near to everyone.    \"I trust not. One would always pray against that.\"    \"He is really--I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.  But this time I'm not to blame; I want you to believe that. I simply  slipped into those violets. No, I want to be really truthful. I am a  little to blame. I had silly thoughts. The sky, you know, was gold,  and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a  book.\"    \"In a book?\"    \"Heroes--gods--the nonsense of schoolgirls.\"    \"And then?\"    \"But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.\"    Miss Bartlett was silent. Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a  certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately  to her. All the way back Lucy's body was shaken by deep sighs, which  nothing could repress.    \"I want to be truthful,\" she whispered. \"It is so hard to be absolutely  truthful.\"    \"Don't be troubled, dearest. Wait till you are calmer. We will talk it  over before bed-time in my room.\"    So they re-entered the city with hands clasped. It was a shock to the  girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. The storm had ceased,  and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son. Mr. Beebe had regained good  humour, and Mr. Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish. Charlotte alone  she was sure of--Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and  love.    The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long  evening. She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she  should describe it. All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her  moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be  carefully laid before her cousin. And together in divine confidence they  would disentangle and interpret them all.    \"At last,\" thought she, \"I shall understand myself. I shan't again  be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don't know  what.\"    Miss Alan asked her to play. She refused vehemently. Music seemed to  her the employment of a child. She sat close to her cousin, who, with  commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.  When it was over she capped it by a story of her own. Lucy became rather  hysterical with the delay. In vain she tried to check, or at all events  to accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett  had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle  reproach:    \"Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my  room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.\"    With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the  girl. Then Miss Bartlett said \"So what is to be done?\"    She was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her that she  would have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all  that she had counted upon.    \"What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.\"    The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt  damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers  close to Miss Bartlett's toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic  shadows on the bolted door. A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt  unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted  them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and  vague, the very ghosts of joy.    \"It has been raining for nearly four hours,\" she said at last.    Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.    \"How do you propose to silence him?\"    \"The driver?\"    \"My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.\"    Lucy began to pace up and down the room.    \"I don't understand,\" she said at last.    She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely  truthful.    \"How are you going to stop him talking about it?\"    \"I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.\"    \"I, too, intend to judge him charitably. But unfortunately I have met  the type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.\"    \"Exploits?\" cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.    \"My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first? Come here  and listen to me. I am only gathering it from his own remarks. Do you  remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one  person is an extra reason for liking another?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.    \"Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him a wicked young man,  but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined. Let us put it down to his  deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish. But we are no farther  on with our question. What do you propose to do?\"    An idea rushed across Lucy's brain, which, had she thought of it sooner  and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.    \"I propose to speak to him,\" said she.    Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.    \"You see, Charlotte, your kindness--I shall never forget it. But--as you  said--it is my affair. Mine and his.\"    \"And you are going to IMPLORE him, to BEG him to keep silence?\"    \"Certainly not. There would be no difficulty. Whatever you ask him he  answers, yes or no; then it is over. I have been frightened of him. But  now I am not one little bit.\"    \"But we fear him for you, dear. You are so young and inexperienced, you  have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can  be--how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her  sex does not protect and rally round. This afternoon, for example, if I  had not arrived, what would have happened?\"    \"I can't think,\" said Lucy gravely.    Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning  it more vigorously.    \"What would have happened if I hadn't arrived?\"    \"I can't think,\" said Lucy again.    \"When he insulted you, how would you have replied?\"    \"I hadn't time to think. You came.\"    \"Yes, but won't you tell me now what you would have done?\"    \"I should have--\" She checked herself, and broke the sentence off. She  went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.  She could not think what she would have done.    \"Come away from the window, dear,\" said Miss Bartlett. \"You will be seen  from the road.\"    Lucy obeyed. She was in her cousin's power. She could not modulate out  the key of self-abasement in which she had started. Neither of them  referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and  settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.    Miss Bartlett became plaintive.    \"Oh, for a real man! We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is  hopeless. There is Mr. Eager, but you do not trust him. Oh, for your  brother! He is young, but I know that his sister's insult would rouse  in him a very lion. Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead. There are still  left some men who can reverence woman.\"    As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and  ranged them upon the pin cushion. Then she blew into her gloves and  said:    \"It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.\"    \"What train?\"    \"The train to Rome.\" She looked at her gloves critically.    The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.    \"When does the train to Rome go?\"    \"At eight.\"    \"Signora Bertolini would be upset.\"    \"We must face that,\" said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had  given notice already.    \"She will make us pay for a whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#14)"],[1,"hive, and had been unobserved, because that  part is dark, and escapes the observer's eye.    To appreciate the justice of this suspicion, we thought of making the  support of the hive of glass, and of placing ourselves below to see what  passed in the scene of action. Therefore, a glass table was constructed,  on which were put six hives with swarms of the same year; and, lying  under it, we endeavoured to discover how the drones were destroyed. The  invention succeeded to admiration. On the 4 of July, we saw the workers  actually massacre the males, in the whole six swarms, at the same hour,  and with the same peculiarities.    The glass table was covered with bees full of animation, which flew upon  the drones, as they came from the bottom of the hive; seized them by the  antennae, the limbs, and the wings, and after having dragged them about,  or, so to speak, after quartering them, they killed them by repeated  stings directed between the rings of the belly. The moment that this  formidable weapon reached them, was the last of their existence; they  stretched their wings, and expired. At the same time, as if the workers  did not consider them as dead as they appeared to us, they still stuck  the sting so deep, that it could hardly be withdrawn, and these bees  were obliged to turn upon themselves before the stings could be  disengaged.    Next day, having resumed our former position, we witnessed new scenes of  carnage. During three hours, the bees furiously destroyed the males.  They had massacred all their own on the preceding evening, but now  attacked those which, driven from the neighbouring hives, had taken  refuge amongst them. We saw them also tear some remaining nymphs from  the combs; they greedily sucked all the fluid from the abdomen, and then  carried them away. The following days no drones remained in the hives.    These two observations seem to me decisive. It is incontestible that  nature has charged the workers with the destruction of the males at  certain seasons of the year. But what means does she use to excite their  fury against them? This is a question that I cannot pretend to answer.  However, an observation I have made may one day lead to solution of the  problem. The males are never destroyed in hives deprived of queens, on  the contrary, while a savage massacre prevails in other places, they  there find an asylum. They are tolerated and fed, and many are seen even  in the middle of January. They are also preserved in hives, which,  without a queen properly so called, have some individuals of that  species that lay the eggs of males, and in those whose half fecundated  queens, if I may use the expression, propagate only drones. Therefore,  the massacre takes place but in hives where the queens are completely  fertile, and it never begins until the season of swarming is past.      _PREGNY, 28 August 1791._          LETTER VII.    _SEQUEL OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE RECEPTION OF A STRANGER QUEEN. M. DE  REAUMUR'S OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUBJECT._      I have frequently testified my admiration of M. de Reaumur's  observations on bees. I feel a sensible pleasure in acknowledging that  if I have made any progress in the art of observation, I am indebted for  it to profound study of the works of this naturalist. In general his  authority has such weight, that I can scarcely trust my own experiments  when the results are different from his. Likewise, on finding myself in  opposition to the _historian of bees_, I repeat my experiments. I vary  the mode of conducting them; I examine with the utmost caution all the  circumstances that might mislead me, and never are my labours  interrupted before acquiring the moral certainty of avoiding error. With  the aid of these precautions, I have discovered the justice of M. de  Reaumur's suggestions, and I have a thousand times seen, if certain  experiments seemed to combat them, it was from incorrectness of  execution. Yet I must except some facts where my results have constantly  been different from his. Those respecting the reception of a stranger  queen substituted for the natural one, are of the number.    If, after removing the natural queen, a stranger is immediately  substituted, the usurper is ill received. I never could succeed in  making them adopt her, but by allowing an interval of twenty or  twenty-four hours to elapse. Then they seemed to have forgot their own  queen; and respectfully received any female put in her place. M. de  Reaumur, on the contrary, asserts, that should the original queen be  removed, and another presented, this new one will be perfectly well  received from the beginning. As evidence of this assertion, he gives the  detail of an experiment which must be read in his work, for I shall here  give only an extract of it{L}. He induced four or five hundred bees to  leave their native hive and enter a glass box, containing a small piece  of comb towards the top. At first they were in great agitation; and, to  pacify or console them, he presented a new queen. From this moment, the  tumult ceased, and the stranger queen was received with all respect.    I do not dispute the truth of this experiment; but, in my opinion, it  does not warrant the conclusion that M. de Reaumur deduces from it. His  apparatus removed the bees too much from their natural condition, to  allow him to judge of their instinct and dispositions. In other  situations, he has himself observed, that these animals, reduced to  small numbers, lost their industry and activity, and feebly continued  their ordinary labours. Thus their instinct is affected by every  operation that too much diminishes their number. To render such an  experiment truly conclusive, it must be made in a populous hive; and on  removing the native queen, a stranger must immediately be substituted in  her place. Had this been done, I am fully persuaded, that M. de Reaumur  would have seen the bees imprison the usurper, confine her at least  twelve or fifteen hours among them, and frequently suffocate her: nor  would he have witnessed any favourable reception before an interval of  twenty-four hours after removal of the original queen. No variation has  occurred in my experiments regarding this fact. Their number, and the  attention bestowed on them, make me presume they merit your confidence.    M. de Reaumur, in another passage of the same Memoir, affirms, that  _bees, which have a queen they are satisfied with, are nevertheless  disposed to give the best possible reception to any female that seeks  refuge among them_. In the preceding letter, I have related my  experiments on this head: their success has been very different from  that of M. de Reaumur's. I have proved that the workers never employ  their stings against the queen; but this cannot be called the welcome  reception of a stranger. They retain her within their ranks, and seem to  allow her liberty only when she prepares to combat the reigning queen.  This observation cannot be made except in the thinnest hives. Those used  by M. de Reaumur had always two parallel combs at least, which must  have prevented him from observing some very important circumstances that  influence the conduct of workers when supplied with several females. The  first circles formed around a stranger queen he has taken for caresses;  and, from the little that this queen could advance between the combs, it  must have been impossible for him to observe that the circles, which  always continued contracting, ended in restraint of the females there  inclosed. Had he used thinner hives, he would have discovered that what  he supposed indication of a favourable reception was the prelude of  actual imprisonment.    I feel reluctant to assert that M. de Reaumur was deceived. Yet I cannot  admit that, on certain occasions, bees tolerate a plurality of females  in their hives. The experiment on which this affirmation rests will not  be considered decisive. In the month of December, he introduced a  stranger queen into a glass hive, in his cabinet, and confined her  there. The bees had no opportunity of going out. This stranger was well  received; her presence awakened the workers from their lethargic state,  into which they did not relapse; she excited no carnage; the number of  dead bees on the board of the hive did not sensibly increase; and no  dead queens were found.    Before concluding any thing favourable to the plurality of queens, it  was necessary to ascertain whether the native queen was living when the  new one was introduced into the hive: however the author neglected this;  and it is very probable the hive had lost its queen, since the bees were  languid, and the presence of a stranger restored their activity.    I trust, Sir, that you will pardon this slight criticism. Far from  industriously seeking faults in our celebrated Reaumur, I derive the  greatest pleasure when my observations coincide with his, and still  more, when my experiments justify his conjectures. But I think it  proper to point out those cases where the imperfections of his hives  have led him into error, and to explain from what causes I have not seen  certain facts in the same manner he did. I feel particular anxiety to  merit your confidence, and I am aware that the greatest exertions are  necessary, when I have to combat the historian of bees. I confide in  your judgment; and pray you to be assured of my respect.      _PREGNY, 30. August 1791._      FOOTNOTES:    {L} Edit. 4to, Tom. V. p. 258.
