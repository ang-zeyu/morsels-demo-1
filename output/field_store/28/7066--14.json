We should like to try.\"    \"Then you shall try,\" said Mr Rogers, quietly; \"on condition, mind,  that you will neither of you do anything rash, but follow out either my  advice or that of the General, whom I feel disposed to trust more and  more.\"    The country seemed to grow more romantic and grand the farther they  trekked on away from civilisation, and they travelled now very few  hundred yards without seeing something new and full of interest.  Game  was so abundant that there was no difficulty in keeping up a plentiful  supply.  Dinny even threatened to lose the frying-pan, for, as he said,  he was frying steak morning, noon, and night; but as he loved dearly to  fry one particularly juicy piece always for a gentleman named Dinny,  there was not much fear of his keeping his word.    But somehow Dinny did not add to the harmony of the expedition.  He  proved himself again and again to be an arrant coward; and, coward-like,  he tried to tyrannise over the weaker.    He was afraid of the General; and when, upon one or two occasions, he  had quarrelled with Peter or Dirk, those gentlemen had displayed so much  pugnacity that Dinny had prudently resolved to quarrel with them no  more.  He, however, made up for this by pouring out his virulence upon  Coffee and Chicory, the dogs having been too much for him; and the Zulu  boys bore it all in silence, but evidently meant to remember Dinny's  behaviour when the time came.    One day, soon after entering the game country, the General, who was on  ahead alternately scanning the horizon and the ground, while the oxen  slowly lumbered on behind, suddenly stopped, and began to examine some  footprints in a marshy piece of ground which he had just told Dick to  avoid.    \"What is it?\" said Dick, coming up.    \"Look,\" said the General, pointing to the great footprints.    \"Why, it looks as if a great cat had been here,\" said Dick.    \"Yes; great cat; lion!\" said the Zulu.    And when Mr Rogers and Jack had cantered up, and seen the spoor, as  such footprints were generally termed in South Africa, they knew that  there would be real danger now hovering about their nightly camps.    That afternoon, as they were passing through a woody portion of the  country, Chicory, who was well ahead, assegai in hand, eagerly looking  out for game, was heard suddenly to yell out as if in agony; and as all  ran to his help, he was found to be rolling on the ground, shrieking the  native word for \"Snake! snake!\"    Mr Rogers was the first to reach him, being mounted, and as he drew  rein by the prostrate boy, he saw a long thin snake gliding away.    He was just in time, and leaning forward he took rapid aim with his  fowling-piece; and as the smoke rose, a long thin ash-coloured snake was  seen writhing, mortally wounded, upon the ground.    The General caught the boy by the shoulder, and proceeded to divide his  jet-black hair, examining his scalp carefully, but without finding any  trace of a wound; though Chicory declared that he was killed, and that  the snake had seized him by the head as he was going under a tree.    He had felt it, and when he threw himself forward to avoid it, the  creature writhed and twisted about his neck, till in his horror he  rolled over and over, partly crushing the reptile, which was making its  escape when Mr Rogers's gun put an end to its power of doing mischief.    The General having satisfied himself that his boy was not hurt, sent him  forward with a cuff on the ear, before giving his master a grateful look  for destroying a virulently poisonous serpent--one, he assured them,  whose regular practice was to hang suspended by the tail from some low  branch, and in this position to strike at any living creature that  passed beneath.    \"He would have been dead now,\" said the General, \"if the snake's teeth  had gone through his hair.\"    It was with no little satisfaction then, after this adventure, that the  hunting-party passed through the woody region they were then in, and  came into the open, for during the last few hours everybody's eyes had  been diligently directed at the overhanging branches of the trees, Dinny  being so observant that he two or three times tripped over prostrate  boughs, and went down upon his nose.    As they passed out into the open they were in a rough plain, covered as  far as they could see with coarse herbage; and hardly had the waggon  emerged before Mr Rogers, who was using his glass, drew the General's  attention to some dark objects upon a slope some distance ahead.    The Zulu glanced at the dark shapes for a few moments, and then cried  eagerly,--    \"Buffalo!\"    \"Come along, Dick,\" shouted Jack.    \"Stop, stop!\" exclaimed their father.  \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Shoot a buffalo, father.\"    \"If we can,\" added Dick.    \"But you must be careful.  These buffalo are pretty fierce creatures,  and dangerous at times.\"    \"Yes, very dangerous,\" assented the Zulu.  \"Boss Jack--Boss Dick shoot  one, and the boys drive one to him.\"    The General undertaking to do his best to keep his sons out of danger,  Mr Rogers consented to let them go; and soon afterwards, having made  his plans, the General started off with his boys, pointing out a course  for Jack and Dick to take upon their cobs, advising them both to fire at  the same buffalo as it galloped past them, and then to keep hidden till  the herd had gone by.    This they undertook to do; and away they cantered in one direction, the  General and his boys going in another, so as to get ahead of the herd,  and then show themselves, and that, they expected, would drive them  towards the young hunters.    All turned out exactly as anticipated.  Dick and Jack sat like statues,  in a low hollow, with rifles cocked, and cartridges handy for a second  shot, waiting for the coming of the herd; and at last, just as they had  given up all expectation of seeing them, there was a low rushing sound  in the distance as of wind--then a roar, ever increasing, until it was  like thunder; and then down came the vast herd of heavy animals,  surprising the boys at first by their number, so that they had nearly  all gone by before either of the brothers thought of firing.    Dick was the first to rouse himself from his surprise.    \"Now then, Jack,\" he cried, as their horses stood motionless, watching  the passing drove; \"fire at that slate-coloured bull.  Now then, take  aim together--fire!\"    The two rifle-shots pealed almost like one, and, to the delight of the  boys, they saw the young bull they had shot stagger forward on to its  knees, and then roll over upon its side.    \"Hurray!  First buffalo!\" cried Jack; and together the boys cantered out  into the plain, when, to their intense astonishment, instead of the herd  continuing its flight, about a dozen bulls stopped short, stared at  them, pawed the ground, stuck up their tails, wheeled round, uttered a  fierce roar, and charged.    Even if the boys had felt disposed to meet their enemies with a couple  more shots, the cobs would not have stood still.  They were well-broken,  and trusty; day by day they had seemed to gain confidence in their  riders, and they would stand perfectly still if their bridles were drawn  over their heads and allowed to trail upon the ground; while if Jack or  Dick liked to make a rifle-rest of their backs, they were perfectly  content, and stood as rigidly as if carved out of stone.    But there are bounds even to the confidence of a horse.  When the little  steeds saw the fierce looks of the buffaloes, heard their angry  bellowings, and found that with waving tails, menacing horns, and hoofs  that seemed to thunder as they tore up the ground, the bulls were coming  nearer and nearer, and evidently with the full intent of burying those  sharp horns in their chests, Shoes and Stockings snorted violently,  turned round so suddenly that had not Jack and Dick been excellent  horsemen they would have been thrown, and tore away over the plain.    This was a reverse of circumstances; and naturally feeling startled at  such a change, their boys gave their horses their heads, sat well down,  and kept giving furtive glances behind to see if the bulls were gaining  upon them.    At the end of a few moments, though, it occurred to Dick that their  speed was greater than that of the buffaloes, and consequently that they  would have no difficulty, failing accidents, in galloping away.  Then he  began to think of his rifle and ammunition, but felt that under the  circumstances fire-arms were useless.    Last of all he began to feel very much ashamed of his position, in being  hunted like this.    The same feeling seemed to have affected Jack, who looked at his brother  as they raced on side by side.    The consequence was that all of a sudden they both sat up more erect in  their saddles, and took a pull at the reins, bringing Shoes and  Stockings by degrees into a hand gallop, instead of the _ventre a terre_  progress they were making before.    \"This won't do,\" cried Dick, as he glanced back to find that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#14)"],[1,"Jersey, from Pennsylvania,  and from Virginia, and with their coming, nearly all in the same year,  there began that mingling of the American strains which has since made  Ohio the most American state in the Union, first in war and first in  peace; which has given the nation such soldiers as Grant, Sherman,  Sheridan, McPherson; such presidents as Grant, Hayes, Garfield,  Harrison, McKinley; such statesmen and jurists as Ewing, Cor-win, Wade,  Chase, Giddings, Sherman, Waite. We have to own, in truth and honesty,  that the newcomers might be unlawfully and unrightfully in the great  territory which was destined to be the great state, but it is consoling  to realize that they were not unreasonably there. It was not reasonable  that the land should be left to savages who must each keep fifty  thousand acres of it wild for his needs as a hunter. The earth is for  those who will use it, and not for those who will waste it, and the  Indians who would not suffer themselves to be tamed could not help  wasting the land.    If the whites made any mistake, it was in allowing any man to own more  land than he could use; but this is a mistake which prevails in our own  day as it prevailed in the days of the pioneers, and they were not to  blame for being no wiser at the end of the eighteenth century than  we are at the end of the nineteenth. The states consenting to the  organization of the Northwest Territory meant that their citizens who  had fought for the independence of the nation in the Revolutionary War  should first of all have their choice of its lands, and so we find Ohio  divided up into the Virginia Military District, the Connecticut Western  Reserve, and the Bounty Lands of Pennsylvania. But large grants were  made to land companies, and the innumerable acres were juggled out of  the hands of the people into the hands of the speculators, as the public  lands have been ever since, until now there are no public lands left  worth having.    The Ohio Indians knew nothing of all this, or as little as they have  ever known of the fate of their ancient homes on the frontier which we  have pressed further and further westward. They held in their stubborn  way that the line between them and the whites was still the Ohio River,  as it had been for fifty years; and they made war upon the invaders  wherever they found them. At times they gathered force for a great  battle, and in the first two of these battles they were the victors,  but in the third they were beaten and their strength and spirits were  broken. In 1790 General Harmar destroyed the towns of the Miamis on the  Wabash; but they ambushed his retreat and punished his fifteen hundred  men so severely that he was forced back to the Ohio. In 1791 General  Arthur St. Clair led an army against the Indians in the Maumee country,  and was attacked and routed with greater havoc than the savages had ever  yet made of the whites, except perhaps in Braddock's defeat. In 1792  General Anthony Wayne set about gathering another army for the Indian  campaign. He moved into the enemy's country slowly, building forts in  Darke County and Mercer (where St. Clair was routed) as he advanced. In  1794, at the meeting of the Auglaize and Maumee, twenty miles from the  last post, which he named Fort Defiance, he finally met the tribes in  great force, and defeated them so thoroughly that for sixteen years they  never afterwards made head against the Americans.    At this day we can hardly imagine the dismay that the rout of St. Clair  and the slaughter of his men spread through the Ohio country. He was  a gallant officer, the governor of the Northwest Territory, and the  trusted friend of Washington. It is true that his army was largely the  refuse of the Eastern States, picked up in the streets of the larger  towns and lured into the wilderness with the promise of three dollars a  month; that these men were badly fed, badly clothed, and badly drilled;  and that they were led by a general whose strength and spirits were  impaired by sickness. But with them was a large body of Kentuckians and  other backwoodsmen, skilled in Indian warfare, and eager for the red  foes with whom they had long arrears of mutual injury to bring up; and  the hopes of the settlers rested securely upon these. The Indians were  led by Little Turtle, one of their greatest war chiefs, and at the point  where General Wayne two years later built one of his forts, and called  it Recovery, they surprised St. Clair's troops.    [Illustration: The defeat of St. Clair 107]    It was an easy slaughter. St. Clair was suffering so much with gout that  he could not move from his horse when he was helped to the saddle, and  was wholly unfit to fight. Yet he went undauntedly through the battle;  horse after horse was shot under him, and his clothes were pierced with  nine of the bullets which the Indians rained upon his men from every  tree of the forest. The backwoodsmen had hardly a chance to practice the  Indians' arts against them before the rout began. The cannon which St.  Clair had brought into the wilderness with immense waste of time and  toil, proved useless under the fire that galled the artillerymen. The  weak, undisciplined, and bewildered army was hemmed in on every side,  and the men were shot down as they huddled together or tried to straggle  away, till half their number was left upon the field. Of course none of  the wounded were spared. The Americans were tomahawked and scalped where  they fell; one of the savages told afterwards that he plied his hatchet  until he could hardly lift his arm. All the Ohio tribes shared in the  glory of this greatest victory of their race,--Delawares, Shawnees,  Wyandots, Ottawas, Chippeways, and Pottawottomies. There had been plenty  of game that year; they were all in the vigor and force which St.  Clair's ill-fated army lacked; and they lustily took their fill of  slaughter.    Many stories of the battle were told by those who escaped. Major Jacob  Fowler, of Kentucky, an old hunter, who went with the army as surveyor,  carried his trusty rifle, but he had run short of bullets, the morning  of the fight, which began at daybreak. He was going for a ladle to melt  more lead, when he met a Kentucky rifleman driven in by the savages, and  begged some balls of him. The man had been shot through the wrist, and  he told Fowler to help himself from his pouch. Fowler was pouring out  a double handful, when the man said, \"Stop; you had better count them.\"  Fowler could not help laughing, though it was hardly the time for  gayety. \"If we get through this scrape, my dear fellow,\" said he, \"I  will return you twice as many.\" But they never met again, and Fowler  could only suppose that his cautious friend was soon tomahawked and  scalped with the other wounded. Fowler took to a tree, and shot Indians  till his gunlock got out of order. Then he picked up a rifle which had  been thrown away, and which he found his bullets would fit, and renewed  the fight. It was a very cold November morning, and his fingers became  so stiff that he could not hold the bullets, which he had to keep in his  mouth, and feed into his rifle from it. At one time he was behind a very  small tree, and two Indians fired on him at such close range that he  felt the smoke of their guns and gave himself up for dead. But both had  missed him, and he got away from the battlefield unhurt.    Another Kentuckian, a young ranger named William Kennan, was one of  the first riflemen driven back by the overwhelming force of Indians. He  tried to hide in the tall grass, but found that his only hope was in  his heels. The savages endeavored to cut him off, but he distanced all  except one, who followed him only three yards away. Kennan expected him  every moment his tomahawk at him, and he felt in his belt for his own.  It had slipped from its place, and he found himself wholly unarmed, just  as he came to a tree which the wind had blown down, and which spread  before him a mass of roots and earth eight or nine feet high. He  gathered all his strength, bounded into the air, and cleared it, while a  yell of wonder rose from the baffled Indians behind him. A little later  he came upon General Madison of Kentucky sitting on a log, so spent with  the day's work and loss of blood from a wound, that he could no longer  walk, and waiting for the Indians to come up and kill him. Kennan ran  back and caught a horse which he had seen grazing, put Madison on it,  and walked by his side till they were out of danger. The friendship thus  begun lasted through their lives.    [Illustration: The escape of Kennan 109]    This is one of the few softer lights in the picture whose darker  features we must not fail to look upon. One of the grimmest of them  was the war chief of the Missasagos, Little Turtle, who planned the  surprise, against the advice of all the other chiefs, and who merits  the fame of the awful day. To the Americans who saw him then, he was a  sullen and gloomy giant, who fought with his men throughout the battle,  arrayed in the conspicuous splendor of a great war, chief, with silver  ornaments dangling from his nose and ears. Hardly less terrible than the  figure of this magnificent butcher is that of the Chickasaw warrior who  accompanied the American army, to glut the hate of his nation for the  Northern tribesmen. When the fight began, he said he would not stand for  the Shawnees to shoot him down like a wild pigeon, and he left the ranks  and took to a fallen log, where he fired with unfailing aim. But he  could not be kept from leaving it to scalp the other Indians as he shot  them, and his own turn to be shot and scalped came at last.    The battle ground was covered with a thick slush from the new-fallen  snow, and this made the retreat more exhausting. A poor mother, perhaps  one of the soldiers' or pioneers' wives, staggered along with a baby  in her arms till she fell with it. The ranger McDowell then"]]]
