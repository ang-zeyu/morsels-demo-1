But the victory, like other German victories, while decisive as far as  the particular Russian army involved was concerned, did nothing toward  hastening peace. The beginning of Spring found the armies in both  theatres completely at a standstill, except in Galicia.    In the west since the failure of the German drive on Calais there has  been no movement that has affected the general situation. The  anniversary of the declaration of war finds the lines of the Germans  and the French practically where they were six months ago. A number of  battles have been fought for the possession of certain points of  vantage--in the Champagne, the Argonne, at Neuve Chapelle, Ypres, Les  Eparges, Hartmannsweilerkopf, Metzeral, Souchez--but they have  resulted in only a local effect, although they have been accompanied  in almost every case by losses that have been staggering.    The principal event of the Spring in the west has been the advent of  Italy into the maelstrom. But this has not affected the situation up  to the present time. Italy has a hard problem on her hands which must  be solved before she can make herself felt. She has but one line of  advance--the line of the Isonzo. But she dare not advance and leave  the passes through the Tyrolean and the Carnic Alps open for Germany  and Austria to pour troops in against her flank and rear. Her task  therefore is first to stop every pass by which this can be done; and  then, and then only, is she ready to move. This is being done, but  the task is a difficult one, the country impossible from a military  viewpoint, and progress necessarily slow.    In the east, however, the coming of Spring brought a series of the  most tremendous movements of the war. The Allies began an operation  against the Dardanelles, with the object of forcing the strait, taking  Constantinople, and thus at once releasing the great store of grain in  Southern Russia and providing a means of getting ammunition to Russia  from the west. The operations at first were entirely naval. But after  serious loss, with no corresponding advantage, it was realized that  the naval forces alone were not sufficient, and troops were landed on  the western end of the Gallipoli Peninsula. This force has been for  three months hammering at the positions of the Turks along the  Achibaba line, but, except for the possible influence on the Balkan  States of the presence of these expeditionary forces on Gallipoli,  little headway has been made. Certain it is that there is no  indication that the near future will bring the Allies into  Constantinople.    In Galicia the Spring began with the capitulation of Przemysl and the  surrender to the Russians of about 125,000 Austrians. This was the  greatest victory in the eastern theatre thus far, and immediately  opened the way wide to the passes in the Carpathians that led to the  Hungarian plains and to Cracow. Russia evidently felt that if she  confined her operations to Austria she could, by pushing the attack  into Hungary, crush Austria completely and eliminate her from the war.  Accordingly, the opportunity of laying siege to Cracow was passed by  and Russian efforts concentrated in forcing the Carpathian passes.    For weeks the battle of the Carpathians was in progress. The  Austrians, reinforced by strong German contingents, fought  desperately, and, although several of the passes were finally  captured, Uzok Pass, the centre of the line and the key to the whole  Carpathian situation, held out. While the battle for its possession  was in progress the Germans were quietly concentrating along the  Dunajec. Suddenly their attack was launched, the line of the Dunajec  forced, and the Russian flank and their lines of communication were  seriously involved. To prevent being cut off, the forces in the  Carpathians were compelled to fall back to their lateral lines.  Preponderance of artillery forced the retreat through Galicia, and in  an incredibly short time Jaroslaw, Przemysl, and Lemberg were again in  the hands of the Teutons and Galicia practically cleared of the  Russian invaders.    Earlier in the Spring the Germans under von Buelow had landed in  Northern Russia and the Gulf of Riga, and, gradually working south,  had effected a junction with von Hindenburg's army in front of Warsaw.  Coming north through Galicia, Mackensen had driven the Russians back  to the line of the Ivangorod-Lublin railroad and had established  connections with von Hindenburg's right. Von Linsengen and the  Austrian Archduke Francis Joseph completed the line facing the  Russians along the upper Viprez, the Bug, the Flota Lipa, and the  Dniester. Simultaneously, with all flanks guarded, the Teutons began  to close in on Warsaw in the most stupendous military movement of  history. As this article is written it seems that nothing can save the  Polish capital; before it goes to press, even Warsaw may be in German  hands. One thing is evident--the Kaiser has returned to his plan of a  year ago--Napoleon's plan--the only plan that can succeed--completely  to crush one opponent first and then turn against the other; only now  it is Russia and not France upon which the blows are falling.         NOTE: A military review of the European warfare during       August will appear in the next number of CURRENT HISTORY, in       connection with the Chronology.--[_Editor_, CURRENT       HISTORY.]          Inferences from Eleven Months of the European Conflict    By Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University      Asticou, Maine, July 16, 1915.    _To the Editor of the New York Times:_    The inferences of the first importance are military and naval. In the  conduct of war on land it has been demonstrated during the past eleven  months that success in battle depends primarily on the possession and  skillful use of artillery and machine guns. The nation which can  command the largest quantity of artillery in great variety of calibre  and range, has developed the amplest and quickest means of  transporting artillery and supplies of all sorts, and whose troops can  use mortars, howitzers, and cannon at the highest speed and with the  greatest accuracy will have important advantages over an enemy less  well provided, or less skillful. Before every assault by infantry  artillery must sweep and plow the position to be captured, and so soon  as the enemy has lost a trench or a redoubt the enemy's artillery will  try to destroy the successful troops with shell and shrapnel, before  the enemy's infantry makes a counter-attack. Whenever troops have open  ground to cross before they reach the intrenchments of the enemy, they  encounter a withering fire from machine guns, which is so effective  that assaults over open ground have, for the most part, to be  undertaken at night or in fog, or by some sort of surprise.    In general the defense has great advantage over the attack, as regards  expenditure of both men and munitions. So decided is the advantage of  the defense, that Germany can dismiss all those apprehensions about  invasion by the Russian hordes with which she set out on this war.  Success in military movements on a large scale depends on the means of  transportation at hand; and these means of transportation must include  railroads, automobiles, and horse wagons, the function of the  automobile being of high importance wherever the roads are tolerably  good. There is little use for cavalry in the new fighting; for  aeroplanes can do better scouting and more distant raiding than  cavalry ever could, and large bodies of infantry with their  indispensable supplies can be moved faster and further by automobiles  than cavalry could ever be.    The aeroplane also defeats the former use of cavalry to screen from  the enemy's view the movements of troops and their trains behind the  actual fronts. Moreover, cavalry cannot stand at all against the new  artillery and the machine gun. An old-fashioned cavalry charge in the  open is useless, and indeed impossible. Aerial warfare is still  undeveloped, but the war has proved that the aeroplane, even in its  present imperfect condition, is a useful instrument. The Zeppelin, on  the other hand, seems to be too fragile and too unmanageable for  effective use in war. Rifle fire is of far less importance than  artillery and machine gun fire; and, indeed, the abandonment of the  rifle as the principal arm for infantry is clearly suggested.    Elaborate forts made of iron and concrete are of little use against a  competent invader, and fortifications round about cities are of no use  for protection against an enemy that possesses adequate artillery. For  the defense of a frontier, or of the approaches to a railroad junction  or a city, a system of trenches is immeasurably superior to forts,  particularly if behind the trenches a network of railways or of smooth  highways exists. Wounds are often inflicted by jagged pieces of metal  which carry bits of dirty clothing and skin into the wounds, and the  wounded often lie on the ground for hours or even days before aid can  reach them. Hence the surgery of this war is largely the surgery of  infected wounds, and not of smooth aseptic cuts and holes. A  considerable percentage of deaths and permanent disabilities among the  wounded is the inevitable result. Surgeons and dressers are more  exposed to death and wounds than in former wars, because of the large  use of artillery of long range, the field hospitals being often under  fire.    From these changes in the methods of war on land it may be safely  inferred that a nation which would be strong in war on land must be  strong in all sorts of manufacturing, and particularly in the  metallurgical industries. A nation chiefly devoted to agriculture and  the ancient trades cannot succeed in modern war,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#14)"],[1," with bright blue paint. There was a church, of course, on one side of the  large square smothered in high grass, and by the church two wooden  pillars supported a beam from which hung a bronze bell. Then in the  centre of the square stood, most prominent of all in the village, a huge  wooden cross in a dilapidated condition. What little life seemed to exist  in the place was to be found in the local store, where an inquisitive  crowd had collected when I arrived.    [Illustration: Goyaz Railway in Construction.    The cut leading to the Paranahyba River.]    [Illustration: Author's Caravan crossing a Stream.]    My mules were let loose to graze in the square, joining a number of cows  that were there already. As I sat in the shop, closely examined by the  inhabitants, I returned the compliment by analysing them. What a  strange, dried-up, worn-out appearance young and old presented! What  narrow, chicken-like chests, what long, unstable legs and short arms.  And, dear me! what shaggy, rebellious hair, which stood out bristle-like  in all directions upon their scalps! Yet those people came from ancestors  who must have been, centuries ago, magnificent types of humanity to be  able to accomplish what they did in the way of colonization. With the  habit we possess of looking for finer, healthier specimens of humanity in  the country than in the cities, this condition of affairs came somewhat  as a surprise to me, since that rule generally applied to most nations I  have visited except Brazil. Those people, partly by constant  intermarriage among themselves, partly by the mixture of black blood with  the white, and greatly owing to the effects of the most terrible  complaint of the blood in existence--universal in Brazil--partly, too, by  the dull, uninteresting, wasted lives they led and the poverty of their  nourishment, were reduced to a state of semi-idiocy. The men hardly  seemed to have the strength and energy to walk or even stand up--although  I must confess, to my regret, that they had not yet lost the power of  talking.    Their features were unattractive. Eyes wide apart and widely expanded, so  that the entire circle of the iris was exposed, although the eyeball  itself was not _a fleur de tete_, but rather sunk into excessively  spacious orbital cavities in the skull. The part of the eyeball which is  usually white was yellow with them, softened somewhat by luxuriant  eyelashes of abnormal length. In fact, the only thing that seemed  plentiful and vigorous with them was the hair, which grew abundantly and  luxuriantly everywhere, just as bad grass and weeds do on uncultivated or  abandoned lands. There was a lot of hair everywhere--on the scalp, on the  eyebrows, on the men's unshaven cheeks, on the chest, the arms, hands,  and the legs. It is, I believe, a well-known fact that hair is generally  more luxuriant, the weaker and more anaemic the subject is--up to a  certain point.    Deep grooves and hollow cheeks--the latter due to absence of  teeth--marked the faces of even young men. Then one of the most  noticeable peculiarities was the extraordinary development, prominence  and angularity of the apple of the throat. The ears--which to my mind  show the real character and condition of health of a person more than any  other visible part of his or her anatomy--were large and prominent,  occasionally well-formed, but lacking colour and the delightful,  well-chiselled, vigorous curves of healthy, normal, intelligent people.  The hands and feet were generally small and well-shaped, in wonderful  condition--though not necessarily clean--owing to the inborn reluctance  which all the people of Brazil have towards manual labour.    It has always been my experience that, generally speaking, malformed  people possess distorted brains--which does not mean at all that the  brain of a malformed person may not perhaps develop in a marvellous  manner in one particular direction. What I maintain is that, with few  possible exceptions, the brains of malformed people are seldom perfectly  balanced. In those particular subjects it did not take a deep student of  human nature to set down the entire crowd of them as visionaries, most  fantastically inclined--in which direction, having no restraint whatever,  they ran absolutely amuck.    Yet there was something very charming about the people of the interior of  Brazil, after they had overcome their first suspicion of strangers and  their own shyness. They seemed imbued with the idea that everybody went  there specially to do them harm. They lived in a constant state of fear  and trembling, even of their own relations and friends. They all went  about armed to the teeth, and would not dream of going a yard outside  their homes without a revolver, a rifle and a dagger. Even to walk about  the village the men were all armed.    When not in a rage or sulky--which seemed to be their almost constant  condition--they were the most good-hearted people I have ever met;  gentle, affectionate--in fact, so sentimental that it became a positive  nuisance. If one learnt how to deal with them--which was not always  easy--they were really delightful people in their enviable simplicity.    A reflection of the people's mentality was to be discovered at a glance  in examining the articles that were for sale in the only shop in the  village. There, remember, you were in a country which, from an  agricultural point of view, could be made of immense value. Now, did you  notice any implements in the shop which suggested agricultural pursuits  of any kind whatever? No; what you found were patent leather dress shoes,  elaborately embroidered top-boots, fancy neckties, gaudy gilt and silver  spurs of immense size, bottles of powerful perfumes, fancy soaps,  mirrors, combs, and highly-coloured calicoes, beer, fire-water, and other  such articles of luxury.    [Illustration: Characteristic Types of Brazilians of the Interior.    (Notice degenerate faces and development of goitre.)]    [Illustration: A Typical Village of the Province of Goyaz.]    The Corumbahyba village stood at an elevation of 2,250 ft. in a hollow  surrounded by low hills. The water was delicious at that place.    As I was getting through my lunch--which I enjoyed thoroughly after my  morning march of 23 kil.--I saw crossing the square two murderers laden  with iron chains, led along with a rope by two mounted men. The natives  present laughed as they saw the poor devils struggle along. Not a sign of  pity or care was shown by anybody present.    After leaving Corumbahyba we witnessed a panorama of magnificent mountain  scenery from a height of 2,550 ft., to which we had ascended. Then came a  steep and rugged descent through a forest down to a streamlet (2,250  ft.); then up another ascent to 2,350 ft. and down again to 2,050 ft. at  the great Corumba River, there 300 yards wide. We crossed this beautiful  stream--animals and all--on three canoes joined together, upon which a  platform had been built.          CHAPTER V         Travelling across Country--A Musical Genius--Valuable       Woods--Thermal Springs      AT the river were several picturesque two-wheeled carts waiting to be  ferried across. Drawn by ten, twenty, and even as many as thirty oxen,  these heavy hooded vehicles travelled across country in a most wonderful  manner. Naturally they had to be of solid construction to stand the wear  and tear demanded of them. Their wheels were heavy solid discs of hard  wood encircled by powerful tyres of iron. A primitive system of brake--a  mere bar of wood held in position by ropes--retarded the speed of the  vehicle down extra-steep declivities. When going up or down hill the  friction of the wheels upon their axles produced a continuous shrill  whistle, which, when heard from a distance, sounded not unlike the  whistle of a locomotive. In the deathly stillness of the Goyaz landscape  those whistles could be heard a long way off. The expectant  farmers--expectant, because those trading carts conveyed to them a good  deal of the food-stuff, salt, and other necessaries of life, as well as  the luxuries they could afford--were clever at recognizing the whistles  of the various carts, and they identified one special cart or another by  what they poetically called the \"voice of the wheel\" or the \"song of  Goyaz.\"    There were some picturesque rapids just above the spot where we crossed  the Corumba River, which flowed in a tortuous channel with a general  direction of W.S.W.    To the east of our track, as we proceeded northward, stood a glorious  range of hills with magnificent grazing land extending for many miles. In  front of us to the north and N.N.E. towered a high plateau, the Serra de  Callos, also called, I believe, Serra do Cusuzeiro.    Still travelling up and down and across several streamlets, we reached at  sunset the Rio Boccagna (2,230 ft. above the sea level), which, soon  after passing the place where we crossed it, entered the large river  Bagri, winding its way through a gorgeous forest. We had passed during  the day really wonderful grazing land on either side of the track, but  principally to the east, between the north bank of the Corumba River and  Camp Mazagan. There were plenty of small streams in the hilly and  sometimes slightly wooded valleys.    At seven o'clock, having ridden that day 76 kil., we halted after dark at  the _moradoria_, or farm, of Mazagan (elev. 2,375 ft. above the sea  level). We were politely asked to enter the house, and immediately  preparations were made to clear out the best room for me. The  illumination was not grand: an ancient metal arrangement--not unlike a  Pompeian lamp--with a wick soaked in oil profusely smoking. In the dim  light I could just distinguish in the background, reclining against the  wall, a youth with a guitar, from which two chords--always the same two  chords--were strummed. The boy seemed in a trance over this musical  composition, and even our"]]]
