You're the last one I'll see. Are there  any more hobos outside?\"    \"Not when I came in.\"    \"Then we'll get down to business. I'll tell you what I want done,  and if you are willing you can do it; if you are not willing you  can leave it--and go to the devil! Sit down.\"    Ashe sat down. He resented the little man's tone, but this was  not the moment for saying so. His companion scrutinized him  narrowly.    \"So far as appearance goes,\" he said, \"you are what I want.\" Ashe  felt inclined to bow. \"Whoever takes on this job has got to act  as my valet, and you look like a valet.\" Ashe felt less inclined  to bow.    \"You're tall and thin and ordinary-looking. Yes; so far as  appearance goes, you fill the bill.\"    It seemed to Ashe that it was time to correct an impression the  little man appeared to have formed.    \"I am afraid,\" he said, \"if all you want is a valet, you will  have to look elsewhere. I got the idea from your advertisement  that something rather more exciting was in the air. I can  recommend you to several good employment agencies if you wish.\"  He rose. \"Good-morning!\" he said.    He would have liked to fling the massive pewter inkwell at this  little creature who had so keenly disappointed him.    \"Sit down!\" snapped the other.    Ashe resumed his seat. The hope of adventure dies hard on a  Spring morning when one is twenty-six, and he had the feeling  that there was more to come.    \"Don't be a damned fool!\" said the little man. \"Of course I'm not  asking you to be a valet and nothing else.\"    \"You would want me to do some cooking and plain sewing on the  side, perhaps?\"    Their eyes met in a hostile glare. The flush on the little man's  face deepened.    \"Are you trying to get fresh with me?\" he demanded dangerously.    \"Yes,\" said Ashe.    The answer seemed to disconcert his adversary. He was silent for  a moment.    \"Well,\" he said at last, \"maybe it's all for the best. If you  weren't full of gall probably you wouldn't have come here at all;  and whoever takes on this job of mine has got to have gall if he  has nothing else. I think we shall suit each other.\"    \"What is the job?\"    The little man's face showed doubt and perplexity.    \"It's awkward. If I'm to make the thing clear to you I've got to  trust you. And I don't know a thing about you. I wish I had  thought of that before I inserted the advertisement.\"    Ashe appreciated the difficulty.    \"Couldn't you make an A--B case out of it?\"    \"Maybe I could if I knew what an A--B case was.\"    \"Call the people mixed up in it A and B.\"    \"And forget, halfway through, who was which! No; I guess I'll  have to trust you.\"    \"I'll play square.\"    The little man fastened his eyes on Ashe's in a piercing stare.  Ashe met them smilingly. His spirits, always fairly cheerful, had  risen high by now. There was something about the little man, in  spite of his brusqueness and ill temper, which made him feel  flippant.    \"Pure white!\" said Ashe.    \"Eh?\"    \"My soul! And this\"--he thumped the left section of his  waistcoat--\"solid gold. You may fire when ready, Gridley.  Proceed, professor.\"    \"I don't know where to begin.\"    \"Without presuming to dictate, why not at the beginning?\"    \"It's all so darned complicated that I don't rightly know which  is the beginning. Well, see here . . . I collect scarabs. I'm  crazy about scarabs. Ever since I quit business, you might say  that I have practically lived for scarabs.\"    \"Though it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone,\" said  Ashe. \"Incidentally, what are scarabs?\" He held up his hand.  \"Wait! It all comes back to me. Expensive classical education,  now bearing belated fruit. Scarabaeus--Latin; noun, nominative--a  beetle. Scarabaee--vocative--O you beetle! Scarabaeum--  accusative--the beetle. Scarabaei--of the beetle. Scarabaeo--to  or for the beetle. I remember now. Egypt--Rameses--pyramids--  sacred scarabs! Right!\"    \"Well, I guess I've gotten together the best collection of  scarabs outside the British Museum, and some of them are worth  what you like to me. I don't reckon money when it comes to a  question of my scarabs. Do you understand?\"    \"Sure, Mike!\"    Displeasure clouded the little man's face.    \"My name is not Mike.\"    \"I used the word figuratively, as it were.\"    \"Well, don't do it again. My name is J. Preston Peters, and Mr.  Peters will do as well as anything else when you want to attract  my attention.\"    \"Mine is Marson. You were saying, Mr. Peters--?\"    \"Well, it's this way,\" said the little man.    Shakespeare and Pope have both emphasized the tediousness of a  twice-told tale; the Episode Of the Stolen Scarab need not be  repeated at this point, though it must be admitted that Mr.  Peters' version of it differed considerably from the calm,  dispassionate description the author, in his capacity of official  historian, has given earlier in the story.    In Mr. Peters' version the Earl of Emsworth appeared as a smooth  and purposeful robber, a sort of elderly Raffles, worming his way  into the homes of the innocent, and only sparing that portion of  their property which was too heavy for him to carry away. Mr.  Peters, indeed, specifically described the Earl of Emsworth as an  oily old second-story man.    It took Ashe some little time to get a thorough grasp of the  tangled situation; but he did it at last.    Only one point perplexed him.    \"You want to hire somebody to go to this castle and get this  scarab back for you. I follow that. But why must he go as your  valet?\"    \"That's simple enough. You don't think I'm asking him to buy a  black mask and break in, do you? I'm making it as easy for him as  possible. I can't take a secretary down to the castle, for  everybody knows that, now I've retired, I haven't got a  secretary; and if I engaged a new one and he was caught trying to  steal my scarab from the earl's collection, it would look  suspicious. But a valet is different. Anyone can get fooled by a  crook valet with bogus references.\"    \"I see. There's just one other point: Suppose your accomplice  does get caught--what then?\"    \"That,\" said Mr. Peters, \"is the catch; and it's just because of  that I am offering good pay to my man. We'll suppose, for the  sake of argument, that you accept the contract and get caught.  Well, if that happens you've got to look after yourself. I  couldn't say a word. If I did it would all come out, and so far  as the breaking off of my daughter's engagement to young  Threepwood is concerned, it would be just as bad as though I had  tried to get the thing back myself.    \"You've got to bear that in mind. You've got to remember it if  you forget everything else. I don't appear in this business in  any way whatsoever. If you get caught you take what's coming to  you without a word. You can't turn round and say: 'I am innocent.  Mr. Peters will explain all'--because Mr. Peters certainly won't.  Mr. Peters won't utter a syllable of protest if they want to hang  you.    \"No; if you go into this, young man, you go into it with your  eyes open. You go into it with a full understanding of the  risks--because you think the reward, if you are successful, makes  the taking of those risks worth while. You and I know that what  you are doing isn't really stealing; it's simply a tactful way of  getting back my own property. But the judge and jury will have  different views.\"    \"I am beginning to understand,\" said Ashe thoughtfully, \"why you  called the job delicate and dangerous.\"    Certainly it had been no overstatement. As a writer of detective  stories for the British office boy, he had imagined in his time  many undertakings that might be so described, but few to which  the description was more admirably suited.    \"It is,\" said Mr. Peters; \"and that is why I'm offering good pay.  Whoever carries this job through gets one thousand pounds.\"    Ashe started.    \"One thousand pounds--five thousand dollars!\"    \"Five thousand.\"    \"When do I begin?\"    \"You'll do it?\"    \"For five thousand dollars I certainly will.\"    \"With your eyes open?\"    \"Wide open!\"    A look of positive geniality illuminated Mr. Peters' pinched  features. He even went so far as to pat Ashe on the shoulder.    \"Good boy!\" he said. \"Meet me at Paddington Station at four  o'clock on Friday. And if there's anything more you want to know  come round to this address.\"    There remained the telling of Joan Valentine; for it was  obviously impossible not to tell her. When you have  revolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot  well conceal the fact, as though nothing had happened. Ashe had  not the slightest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, he  was glad to have such a capital excuse for renewing the  acquaintance.    He could not tell her, of course, the secret details of the  thing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go  airily in and say:    \"You know what you told me about doing something new? Well, I've  just got a job as a valet.\"    So he went airily in and said it.    \"To whom?\" said Joan.    \"To a man named Peters--an American.\"    Women are trained from infancy up to conceal their feelings. Joan  did not start or otherwise express emotion.    \"Not Mr. J. Preston Peters?\"    \"Yes. Do you know him? What a remarkable thing.\"    \"His daughter,\" said Joan, \"has just engaged me as a lady's  maid.\"    \"What!\"    \"It will not be quite the same thing as three years ago,\" Joan  explained. \"It is just a cheap way of getting a holiday. I used  to know Miss Peters very well, you see. It will be more like  traveling as her guest.\"    \"But--but--\" Ashe had not yet overcome his amazement.    \"Yes?\"    \"But what an extraordinary coincidence!\"    \"Yes. By the way, how did you get the situation? And what put it  into your head to be a valet at all?

The gills have become shifted  forward by a metastasis similar to that which brought the whole  thoracic organs far forward in fish. This being so, their supporting  elements, the sternum and the ribs, must have moved with them, and are  hence to be found in front of the pectoral girdle.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Hyoid Arch of the Conger. (Original.)]    Geoffroy's next step is to point out that the only possible homologues  of sternal ribs are the branchiostegal rays, which arise from the large  bones of the hyoid arch. If these are sternal ribs, the bones to which  they are attached must be the hyo- and hyposternals or \"annexes,\" the  bones from which in birds the ribs take their origin.    The unpaired sternal bone (_urohyal_) cannot be homologous with the  entosternal, for it has no connections with the annexes. He decides that  it must represent the episternals, for in some young birds there is a  two-headed episternal to which two strong tendons are attached, just in  the same way as the unpaired piece in fish is bound to the bones of the  hyoid by two tendons. \"Thus it is not the sternum as a whole that has  shifted in front of the clavicles and covered with its side pieces the  gills placed there; it is a piece exclusively piscine, in the sense that  it is only in the class of fishes that it reaches the _maximum_ of its  development\" (p. 83).    To sum up, the sternum in all four vertebrate classes is composed of the  same elements, arranged always in the same way. \"One is ... led to the  conception of an ideal type of sternum for all Vertebrates, which then,  considered from a lower standpoint, resolves itself into several  secondary forms according as the whole or the majority of the  constituent materials are employed, or even as these elements come to  change their respective dimensions or proportions\" (p. 134). As to the  elementary constituents, \"they give proof of individuality, and  sometimes even, in certain abnormalities, of independence, and rise to  the level of primary organisatory materials\" (p. 132). What holds good  for the sternum holds good for other organs--and accordingly the unity  of plan and composition can be demonstrated for all the organs of  Vertebrates.    Soon after the publication of the _Philosophie anatomique_ (1818)  Geoffroy went further in his search for unity, and maintained that the  structure of insects and Crustacea could be reduced to the vertebrate  type.    He proposed to replace Cuvier's classification of the animal kingdom  into the four large groups, Vertebrata, Mollusca, Articulata, and  Radiata by the following classification:--[90]                    Hauts-Vertebres (Vertebrata, Cuv.).       Vertebres /                 \\                  Dermo-Vertebres (Articulata, Cuv.).                      Mollusques (Mollusca, Cuv.).     Invertebres /                 \\                  Rayonnes (Radiata, Cuv.).    The idea upon which is based the comparison of Articulates with  Vertebrates is that each skeletal segment of Articulates is a vertebra.  In the Hauts-vertebres the vertebrae are internal; in the  Dermo-vertebres they are external. \"_Every animal lives either outside  or inside its vertebral column_.\"[91] The essence of a vertebra is not  its form, nor its function, but its composition from four elementary  pieces which unite round a central space (_Isis, loc. cit._, p. 532).  Serres had shown that in the higher animals every vertebra is formed  from four centres of ossification, that the body of the vertebra is at  first tubular, and that afterwards it becomes filled up. In lobsters and  crabs each segment is composed of four elementary pieces, as may be seen  most easily in young ones. \"Accordingly each segment corresponds to a  true vertebra in composition: there is the same number of 'materials,'  the same order in the course of ossification, the same kind of  articulation, the same annular arrangement, the same empty space in the  middle\" (p. 534). The only difference is that in Articulates the central  space is very great and contains all the organs of the body, whereas in  the higher Vertebrates the body of the vertebra becomes completely  filled up. In the thoracic region of Crustacea it is not the whole  segment with part of the carapace which corresponds to a vertebra, but  merely the part round the ventral nerve-cord (endophragmal skeleton).    If the skeleton of the segment in Articulates corresponds to the body of  a vertebra and is here external, then the appendages of the Articulate  must correspond to ribs (p. 538). The full development of this thought  is found in a Memoir of 1822, \"Sur la vertebre.\"[92] He takes as the  typical vertebra that of a Pleuronectid, probably the turbot. His  original figure is reproduced (Fig. 2).    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--\"Vertebra\" of a Pleuronectid. (After Geoffroy.)]    He includes as part of the vertebra not only the neural (e', e'') and  haemal (o', o'') arches, but also, above and below these, the radialia  (a'', u') and the fin-rays (a', u''). (Neither the radialia nor the  fin-rays are, by the way, in the same transverse plane as the body of  the vertebra). Every vertebra, he considers, contains these nine  pieces--the cycleal (or body), the two perials (e', e'') and the two  epials (a', a'') above, the two paraals (o', o'') and the two cataals (u',  u'') below. The epials and the cataals are in reality paired bones which  in fish mount one on top of the other to support the median fins. In the  cranial region--the skull is formed of modified vertebrae--the epials  and perials open out so as to form the walls and roof of the brain; in  the thoracic region the paraals and cataals reach their maximum of  development and perform the same service for the thoracic organs, the  paraals becoming vertebral, and the cataals sternal, ribs.    We have seen that in Arthropods the body of the vertebra (cycleal) forms  the open ring of the segment, which lies immediately under the skin, the  vertebral tube coinciding with the epidermal tube. The homologues of the  other eight pieces of the vertebra must accordingly be sought in the  external appendages. At first sight there seems here a contradiction of  the principle of connections, for the appendages in Arthropods are  lateral, whereas the paired bones of the vertebra are dorsal and  ventral. But there is in reality no contradiction, for \"what our law of  connections absolutely requires is that all organs, whether internal or  external, should stand to one another in the same relations; but it is  all one whether the box (_coffre_) that encloses them lies with this or  that side on the ground. What similarities in the organisation of man  and the digitate mammals, and yet what differences between their  attitudes when standing! The same holds true as regards the normal  attitudes of the pleuronectids and the other fishes\" (p. 107).    The exact way in which Geoffroy homologised the parts of the appendages  in Arthropods with the paired pieces of the typical vertebra is best  shown by the reproduction of his figure of an abdominal segment of the  lobster (Fig. 3), in which the parts homologous with those represented  in the figure of the typical vertebra (Fig. 2) are indicated by the same  letters. The ingenuity of the comparison is astonishing.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Abdominal Segment of the Lobster. (After  Geoffroy.)]    The comparison of the Arthropod with the Vertebrate is extended also to  the internal organs. The internal organs of the Arthropod are shown to  stand in the same order to one another as in the Vertebrate, only the  organs are inverted. Thus the nervous system is dorsal in the  Vertebrate, ventral in the Arthropod. Turn the Arthropod on its back and  the relative positions of the systems of organs are the same as in the  Vertebrate. The relation of the organs to the external tube is of course  different in Arthropods and Vertebrates, but this is no contradiction of  the principle of connections. \"Such a tube, although it is the organs  essential to life that it contains, can yet behave in different ways  with regard to the mass of these organs: the principle of connections  demands only that all the organs maintain with one another fixed and  definite relations; but the principle would be in no way invalidated if  the whole mass had rotated inside the tube\" (p. 112).    Geoffroy pushed the analogy between Arthropods and Vertebrates very far,  for he asserted that every piece in the skeleton of an insect was  homologous with some bone in Vertebrates, that it stood always in its  proper place, and remained faithful to at least one of its  connections.[93] It does not appear that he attempted to prove in detail  this very big assumption, but the beginnings of a detailed comparison  are found in the paper of 1820, _Sur l'organisation des insectes_. Six  segments are distinguished in an insect--the head, the three divisions  of the thorax, the abdomen, and the terminal segment of the abdomen (p.  455).    The skeleton of the insect's head is said to correspond to the bones of  the face, to the bones of the cerebrum and to the hyoid of higher  Vertebrates, the skeleton of the prothorax to the bones of the  cerebellum, of the palate, and the pieces of the larynx, the skeleton of  the mesothorax to the parietals, interparietals, and opercular bones,  and that of the metathorax to the skeleton of the thorax of Vertebrates.  The pieces of the abdomen and of the terminal segment correspond to the  bones of the abdomen and coccyx (p. 458). It does not need the  subsequent likening of the hind wings of insects to the air bladder of  fish, and of the stigmata to the pores of the lateral line, to convince  one finally of the fancifulness of the whole comparison.    In 1830 two young naturalists, Meyranx and Laurencet, presented to the  Academie des Sciences a memoir in which they likened a Cephalopod to a"]]]
