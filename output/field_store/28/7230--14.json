For in financial knowledge and in habits of business Mordaunt and  Delamere were mere children when compared with him; and this William  soon discovered. [74]    Similar feuds raged at the other great boards and through all the  subordinate ranks of public functionaries. In every customhouse, in  every arsenal, were a Shrewsbury and a Nottingham, a Delamere and a  Godolphin. The Whigs complained that there was no department in which  creatures of the fallen tyranny were not to be found. It was idle to  allege that these men were versed in the details of business, that they  were the depositaries of official traditions, and that the friends  of liberty, having been, during many years, excluded from public  employment, must necessarily be incompetent to take on themselves at  once the whole management of affairs. Experience doubtless had its  value: but surely the first of all the qualifications of a servant was  fidelity; and no Tory could be a really faithful servant of the new  government. If King William were wise, he would rather trust novices  zealous for his interest and honour than veterans who might indeed  possess ability and knowledge, but who would use that ability and that  knowledge to effect his ruin.    The Tories, on the other hand, complained that their share of power bore  no proportion to their number and their weight in the country, and that  every where old and useful public servants were, for the crime of being  friends to monarchy and to the Church, turned out of their posts to make  way for Rye House plotters and haunters of conventicles. These upstarts,  adepts in the art of factious agitation, but ignorant of all that  belonged to their new calling, would be just beginning to learn their  business when they had undone the nation by their blunders. To be a  rebel and a schismatic was surely not all that ought to be required of  a man in high employment. What would become of the finances, what of  the marine, if Whigs who could not understand the plainest balance  sheet were to manage the revenue, and Whigs who had never walked over a  dockyard to fit out the fleet. [75]    The truth is that the charges which the two parties brought against each  other were, to a great extent, well founded, but that the blame which  both threw on William was unjust. Official experience was to be found  almost exclusively among the Tories, hearty attachment to the new  settlement almost exclusively among the Whigs. It was not the fault  of the King that the knowledge and the zeal, which, combined, make a  valuable servant of the state must at that time be had separately or  not at all. If he employed men of one party, there was great risk of  mistakes. If he employed men of the other party, there was great risk of  treachery. If he employed men of both parties, there was still some risk  of mistakes; there was still some risk of treachery; and to these risks  was added the certainty of dissension. He might join Whigs and Tories;  but it was beyond his power to mix them. In the same office, at the  same desk, they were still enemies, and agreed only in murmuring at the  Prince who tried to mediate between them. It was inevitable that, in  such circumstances, the administration, fiscal, military, naval, should  be feeble and unsteady; that nothing should be done in quite the  right way or at quite the right time; that the distractions from which  scarcely any public office was exempt should produce disasters, and  that every disaster should increase the distractions from which it had  sprung.    There was indeed one department of which the business was well  conducted; and that was the department of Foreign Affairs. There William  directed every thing, and, on important occasions, neither asked the  advice nor employed the agency of any English politician. One invaluable  assistant he had, Anthony Heinsius, who, a few weeks after the  Revolution had been accomplished, became Pensionary of Holland. Heinsius  had entered public life as a member of that party which was jealous of  the power of the House of Orange, and desirous to be on friendly terms  with France. But he had been sent in 1681 on a diplomatic mission to  Versailles; and a short residence there had produced a complete change  in his views. On a near acquaintance, he was alarmed by the power and  provoked by the insolence of that Court of which, while he contemplated  it only at a distance, he had formed a favourable opinion. He found that  his country was despised. He saw his religion persecuted. His official  character did not save him from some personal affronts which, to the  latest day of his long career, he never forgot. He went home a devoted  adherent of William and a mortal enemy of Lewis. [76]    The office of Pensionary, always important, was peculiarly important  when the Stadtholder was absent from the Hague. Had the politics of  Heinsius been still what they once were, all the great designs of  William might have been frustrated. But happily there was between these  two eminent men a perfect friendship which, till death dissolved it,  appears never to have been interrupted for one moment by suspicion or  ill humour. On all large questions of European policy they cordially  agreed. They corresponded assiduously and most unreservedly. For though  William was slow to give his confidence, yet, when he gave it, he gave  it entire. The correspondence is still extant, and is most honourable to  both. The King's letters would alone suffice to prove that he was one  of the greatest statesmen whom Europe has produced. While he lived, the  Pensionary was content to be the most obedient, the most trusty, and  the most discreet of servants. But, after the death of the master, the  servant proved himself capable of supplying with eminent ability the  master's place, and was renowned throughout Europe as one of the great  Triumvirate which humbled the pride of Lewis the Fourteenth. [77]    The foreign policy of England, directed immediately by William in  close concert with Heinsius, was, at this time, eminently skilful and  successful. But in every other part of the administration the evils  arising from the mutual animosity of factions were but too plainly  discernible. Nor was this all. To the evils arising from the mutual  animosity of factions were added other evils arising from the mutual  animosity of sects.    The year 1689 is a not less important epoch in the ecclesiastical than  in the civil history of England. In that year was granted the first  legal indulgence to Dissenters. In that year was made the last serious  attempt to bring the Presbyterians within the pale of the Church of  England. From that year dates a new schism, made, in defiance of ancient  precedents, by men who had always professed to regard schism with  peculiar abhorrence, and ancient precedents with peculiar veneration.  In that year began the long struggle between two great parties of  conformists. Those parties indeed had, under various forms, existed  within the Anglican communion ever since the Reformation; but till after  the Revolution they did not appear marshalled in regular and permanent  order of battle against each other, and were therefore not known by  established names. Some time after the accession of William they began  to be called the High Church party and the Low Church party; and, long  before the end of his reign, these appellations were in common use. [78]    In the summer of 1688 the breaches which had long divided the great body  of English Protestants had seemed to be almost closed. Disputes about  Bishops and Synods, written prayers and extemporaneous prayers, white  gowns and black gowns, sprinkling and dipping, kneeling and sitting,  had been for a short space intermitted. The serried array which was then  drawn up against Popery measured the whole of the vast interval which  separated Sancroft from Bunyan. Prelates recently conspicuous as  persecutors now declared themselves friends of religious liberty, and  exhorted their clergy to live in a constant interchange of hospitality  and of kind offices with the separatists. Separatists, on the other  hand, who had recently considered mitres and lawn sleeves as the livery  of Antichrist, were putting candles in windows and throwing faggots on  bonfires in honour of the prelates.    These feelings continued to grow till they attained their greatest  height on the memorable day on which the common oppressor finally  quitted Whitehall, and on which an innumerable multitude, tricked out in  orange ribands, welcomed the common deliverer to Saint James's. When the  clergy of London came, headed by Compton, to express their gratitude to  him by whose instrumentality God had wrought salvation for the Church  and the State, the procession was swollen by some eminent nonconformist  divines. It was delightful to many good men to learn that pious and  learned Presbyterian ministers had walked in the train of a Bishop, had  been greeted by him with fraternal kindness, and had been announced by  him in the presence chamber as his dear and respected friends, separated  from him indeed by some differences of opinion on minor points, but  united to him by Christian charity and by common zeal for the essentials  of the reformed faith. There had never before been such a day in  England; and there has never since been such a day. The tide of feeling  was already on the turn; and the ebb was even more rapid than the  flow had been. In a very few hours the High Churchman began to feel  tenderness for the enemy whose tyranny was now no longer feared, and  dislike of the allies whose services were now no longer needed. It  was easy to gratify both feelings by imputing to the dissenters the  misgovernment of the exiled King. His Majesty-such was now the language  of too many Anglican divines-would have been an excellent sovereign  had he not been too confiding,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II â€” Volume 4 (#14)"],[1,"to  a rigorous system of police, the natural though lamentable effect of  extreme danger and extreme provocation. A Papist was not permitted to  have a sword or a gun. He was not permitted to go more than three miles  out of his parish except to the market town on the market day. Lest he  should give information or assistance to his brethren who occupied the  western half of the island, he was forbidden to live within ten miles of  the frontier. Lest he should turn his house into a place of resort  for malecontents, he was forbidden to sell liquor by retail. One  proclamation announced that, if the property of any Protestant should be  injured by marauders, his loss should be made good at the expense of his  Popish neighbours. Another gave notice that, if any Papist who had not  been at least three months domiciled in Dublin should be found there, he  should be treated as a spy. Not more than five Papists were to assemble  in the capital or its neighbourhood on any pretext. Without a protection  from the government no member of the Church of Rome was safe; and the  government would not grant a protection to any member of the Church of  Rome who had a son in the Irish army. [72]    In spite of all precautions and severities, however, the Celt found many  opportunities of taking a sly revenge. Houses and barns were frequently  burned; soldiers were frequently murdered; and it was scarcely possible  to obtain evidence against the malefactors, who had with them the  sympathies of the whole population. On such occasions the government  sometimes ventured on acts which seemed better suited to a Turkish than  to an English administration. One of these acts became a favourite theme  of Jacobite pamphleteers, and was the subject of a serious parliamentary  inquiry at Westminster. Six musketeers were found butchered only a few  miles from Dublin. The inhabitants of the village where the crime had  been committed, men, women, and children, were driven like sheep into  the Castle, where the Privy Council was sitting. The heart of one of the  assassins, named Gafney, failed him. He consented to be a witness, was  examined by the Board, acknowledged his guilt, and named some of his  accomplices. He was then removed in custody; but a priest obtained  access to him during a few minutes. What passed during those few minutes  appeared when he was a second time brought before the Council. He had  the effrontery to deny that he had owned any thing or accused any body.  His hearers, several of whom had taken down his confession in writing,  were enraged at his impudence. The Lords justices broke out; \"You are  a rogue; You are a villain; You shall be hanged; Where is the Provost  Marshal?\" The Provost Marshal came. \"Take that man,\" said Coningsby,  pointing to Gafney; \"take that man, and hang him.\" There was no gallows  ready; but the carriage of a gun served the purpose; and the prisoner  was instantly tied up without a trial, without even a written order for  the execution; and this though the courts of law were sitting at the  distance of only a few hundred yards. The English House of Commons, some  years later, after a long discussion, resolved, without a division, that  the order for the execution of Gafney was arbitrary and illegal, but  that Coningsby's fault was so much extenuated by the circumstances in  which he was placed that it was not a proper subject for impeachment.  [73]    It was not only by the implacable hostility of the Irish that the Saxon  of the pale was at this time harassed. His allies caused him almost as  much annoyance as his helots. The help of troops from abroad was indeed  necessary to him; but it was dearly bought. Even William, in whom  the whole civil and military authority was concentrated, had found it  difficult to maintain discipline in an army collected from many lands,  and composed in great part of mercenaries accustomed to live at free  quarters. The powers which had been united in him were now divided and  subdivided. The two Lords justices considered the civil administration  as their province, and left the army to the management of Ginkell, who  was General in Chief. Ginkell kept excellent order among the auxiliaries  from Holland, who were under his more immediate command. But his  authority over the English and the Danes was less entire; and  unfortunately their pay was, during part of the winter, in arrear. They  indemnified themselves by excesses and exactions for the want of that  which was their due; and it was hardly possible to punish men with  severity for not choosing to starve with arms in their hands. At length  in the spring large supplies of money and stores arrived; arrears  were paid up; rations were plentiful; and a more rigid discipline was  enforced. But too many traces of the bad habits which the soldiers had  contracted were discernible till the close of the war. [74]    In that part of Ireland, meanwhile, which still acknowledged James as  King, there could hardly be said to be any law, any property, or any  government. The Roman Catholics of Ulster and Leinster had fled westward  by tens of thousands, driving before them a large part of the cattle  which had escaped the havoc of two terrible years. The influx of food  into the Celtic region, however, was far from keeping pace with the  influx of consumers. The necessaries of life were scarce. Conveniences  to which every plain farmer and burgess in England was accustomed could  hardly be procured by nobles and generals. No coin was to be seen except  lumps of base metal which were called crowns and shillings. Nominal  prices were enormously high. A quart of ale cost two and sixpence, a  quart of brandy three pounds. The only towns of any note on the western  coast were Limerick and Galway; and the oppression which the shopkeepers  of those towns underwent was such that many of them stole away with the  remains of their stocks to the English territory, where a Papist, though  he had to endure much restraint and much humiliation, was allowed to  put his own price on his goods, and received that price in silver.  Those traders who remained within the unhappy region were ruined.  Every warehouse that contained any valuable property was broken open by  ruffians who pretended that they were commissioned to procure stores for  the public service; and the owner received, in return for bales of cloth  and hogsheads of sugar, some fragments of old kettles and saucepans,  which would not in London or Paris have been taken by a beggar.    As soon as a merchant ship arrived in the bay of Galway or in the  Shannon, she was boarded by these robbers. The cargo was carried away;  and the proprietor was forced to content himself with such a quantity  of cowhides, of wool and of tallow as the gang which had plundered him  chose to give him. The consequence was that, while foreign commodities  were pouring fast into the harbours of Londonderry, Carrickfergus,  Dublin, Waterford and Cork, every mariner avoided Limerick and Galway as  nests of pirates. [75]    The distinction between the Irish foot soldier and the Irish Rapparee  had never been very strongly marked. It now disappeared. Great part of  the army was turned loose to live by marauding. An incessant predatory  war raged along the line which separated the domain of William from  that of James. Every day companies of freebooters, sometimes wrapped in  twisted straw which served the purpose of armour, stole into the English  territory, burned, sacked, pillaged, and hastened back to their  own ground. To guard against these incursions was not easy; for the  peasantry of the plundered country had a strong fellow feeling with the  plunderers. To empty the granary, to set fire to the dwelling, to drive  away the cows, of a heretic was regarded by every squalid inhabitant  of a mud cabin as a good work. A troop engaged in such a work might  confidently expect to fall in, notwithstanding all the proclamations  of the Lords justices, with some friend who would indicate the richest  booty, the shortest road, and the safest hiding place. The English  complained that it was no easy matter to catch a Rapparee. Sometimes,  when he saw danger approaching, he lay down in the long grass of the  bog; and then it was as difficult to find him as to find a hare sitting.  Sometimes he sprang into a stream, and lay there, like an otter, with  only his mouth and nostrils above the water. Nay, a whole gang of  banditti would, in the twinkling of an eye, transform itself into a  crowd of harmless labourers. Every man took his gun to pieces, hid the  lock in his clothes, stuck a cork in the muzzle, stopped the touch hole  with a quill, and threw the weapon into the next pond. Nothing was to be  seen but a train of poor rustics who had not so much as a cudgel among  them, and whose humble look and crouching walk seemed to show that their  spirit was thoroughly broken to slavery. When the peril was over, when  the signal was given, every man flew to the place where he had hid his  arms; and soon the robbers were in full march towards some Protestant  mansion. One band penetrated to Clonmel, another to the vicinity of  Maryborough; a third made its den in a woody islet of firm ground,  surrounded by the vast bog of Allen, harried the county of Wicklow, and  alarmed even the suburbs of Dublin. Such expeditions indeed were not  always successful. Sometimes the plunderers fell in with parties of  militia or with detachments from the English garrisons, in situations in  which disguise, flight and resistance were alike impossible. When this  happened every kerne who was taken was hanged, without any ceremony, on  the nearest tree. [76]    At the head quarters of the Irish army there was, during the winter, no  authority capable of exacting obedience even within a circle of a mile.  Tyrconnel was absent at the Court of France. He had left the supreme  government in the hands of a Council of Regency "]]]
