Such structures are called reduced or vestigial  structures, and among other instances are the clavicles of the rabbit,  the hair on human limbs, the little pulpy nodule in the corner of the  human eye, representing the rabbit's third eyelid, and the caudal  vertebrae at the end of the human spinal column. In certain lowly  reptiles, in the lampreys, and especially in a peculiar New Zealand  lizard, the pineal gland has the most convincing resemblance to an  eye, both in its general build and in the microscopic structure of its  elements; and it seems now more than probable that this little  vascular pimple in our brains is a relic of a third and median eye  possessed by ancestral vertebrata. The pituitary body is probably  equivalent to a ciliated pit we shall describe in the lacelet  (Amphioxus).        8. _Renal and Reproductive Organs_    Section 136. We have now really completed our survey of the  individual animal's mechanism. But no animal that was merely  complete in itself would be long sanctioned by nature. For an animal  species to survive, there must evidently, also, be proper provision for  the production of young, and the preservation of the species as well  as of the individual. Hence in an animal's physiology and psychology  we meet with a vast amount of unselfish provision, and its structure  and happiness are more essentially dependent on the good of its kind  than on its narrow personal advantage. The mammalia probably owe  their present dominant position in the animal kingdom to the  exceptional sacrifices made by them for their young. Instead of  laying eggs and abandoning them before or soon after hatching, the  females retain the eggs within their bodies until the development of  the young is complete, and thereafter associate with them for the  purposes of nourishment, protection, and education. In the matter of  the tail, for instance, already noted, the individual rabbit incurs the  disadvantage of conspicuousness for the rear, in order to further the  safety of the young.      Section 137. The female organs of reproduction are shown in  Sheet 10. The essential organ is the ovary (ov.), in which the ova  (eggs) are formed. Figure 3 gives an enlarged and still more  diagrammatic rendering of the ovary. There is a supporting ground  mass, or stroma, into which numerous bloodvessels and nerves enter  and break up. The ova appear first as small cells in the external  substance of the ovary (as at 1), and move inward (2 and 3),  surrounded by a number of sister cells, which afford them  nourishment. At (4) an ovum with its surrounding group of cells is  more distinct and near the centre of the ovary; a fluid is appearing  within the ovisac as the development proceeds. (5) is a much more  mature ovisac or Graafian follicle.    Section 138. The ovum (ov.), is now large, and its nucleus and  nucleolus (the germinal vesicle and spot) are very distinct. The wall  of the follicle consists, in the mammal, of several layers of cells, the  membrana granulosa (or \"granulosa\" simply); the ovum lies on its  outer side embedded in a mass of cells, discus proligerus,  separated from actual contact with the ovum by a zona pellucida.  The ripening follicle moves to the surface of the ovary and bursts, the  ovum falls into the body cavity. In Figure 2, a ripe Graafian follicle  (G.F.), projects upon the ovary.      Section 139. The liberated ovum is caught up by the funnel-shaped  opening of the Fallopian tube, which passes without any very  conspicuous demarcation into the cornu uteri (c.ut.) of its side; the  two uterine cornua meeting together in the middle line form the vagina  (V.), which runs out into a vestibule (vb.) opening between tumid lips  to the exterior. The urinary bladder (ur.b.) also opens into the  vestibule, and receives the two ureters from the kidney.      Section 140. In the male we find, in the position of the female uterus,  a uterus masculinus (u.m.). The essential sexual organ is the testis  (T.), a compact mass of coiling tubuli, which opens by a number of  ducts, the vasa efferentia, into a looser and softer epididymis (ep.),  which sends the sexual product onward through a vas deferens (v.d.),  to open at the base of the uterus masculinus. The urinary bladder and  ureters correspond with those of the female, and the common  urogenital duct (= vestibule), the urethra, is prolonged into an erectile  penis (P.) surrounded by a fold of skin, the prepuce. A prostate gland  (pr.), contributes to the male sexual fluid. The character of the  essential male element, the spermatozoon, the general nature of the  reproductive process, will be conveniently deferred until the chapters  upon development are reached.        9. _Classificatory Points_    Section 141. The following facts of classificatory importance may now  be considered, but their full force will be better appreciated after the  study of other vertebrate types. They are such as come prominently  forward in the comparison of the rabbit with other organisms.      Section 142. In the first place, the rabbit is a metazoon, one of the  metazoa, i.e., a multicellular organism, as compared with the  amoeba, which belongs to the protozoa or one-cell animals (Section  55). In the next place, it is externally bilaterally symmetrical, its  parts balance, and where, in its internal anatomy, it departs from  this symmetry (as in the case of the aorta, the stomach and  intestines, and the kidneys), the departure has an appearance of  being the results of partial reductions and distortions of an originally  quite symmetrical plan. And the facts of development strengthen this  idea; in the very earliest stages we have paired aortic arches, of  which, the left only remains, a straight alimentary canal, and less  asymmetrical kidneys. In the vast majority of animals the same  bilateral symmetry is to be seen, but in the star-fish and sea-urchins,  and in the jelly-fish, corals, sea anemones, and hydra, the general  form of the animal is, instead, arranged round a centre, like a star and  its rays, and the symmetry is called radial.      Section 143. We also see in various organs of the rabbit, and  especially in the case of the limbs and vertebral column, what is  called metameric segmentation, that is, a repetition of parts, one  behind the other, along the axis of the body. Thus the bodies and  arches of the vertebrae repeat each other, and so do the spinal  nerves. The renal organ of the rabbit, some time before birth,  displays a metameric arrangement of its parts; but this disappears,  as development proceeds, into the compact kidney of the adult. But  the metameric segmentation in the rabbit's organism is not nearly so  marked as that of an earthworm, for instance, which is visibly a  chain of rings. If the student wants a perfect figure of metameric  segmentation he should think of a train of precisely similar  carriages, or a string of beads. One bead, one carriage, one  vertebra, would be a metamere.      Section 144. In contrast to metameric segmentation is the antimeric  repetition of radial symmetry (Section 142), in which each ray of the  star is called an antimere. It is possible to have bilateral symmetry  without a metameric arrangement of parts, as in the mussel and the  cuttle-fish; but metameric segmentation without complete or reduced  bilateral symmetry does not occur.      Section 145. We are now in a position to appreciate the fact that the  old and more popularly know division of animals into vertebrata and  invertebrata scarcely represents the facts of the case, that the  primary division should be into protozoa and metazoa, and that the  vertebrata are one of several groups of metazoa with a fundamental  bilateral symmetry and imperfect metameric segmentation.    The rabbit is one of the vertebrata, and, in common with all the other  animals collected under this head, it has--       (a) A skeletal axis (the vertebral column) between its central     nervous system and its body cavity. In the adult rabbit this     consists of a chain of vertebrae, but in the embryo (i.e., the     young rabbit before birth) it is represented by a continuous chord,     the notochord, and it remains as such in some of the lowest     vertebrata throughout life. In other words, in these lower     vertebrata, the vertebral axis is not metameric.       (b) A dorsal and -Tubular_ nervous axis. (Section 131, the central     canal)       (c) It has, though in the embryo only, certain slits between the     throat and the exterior, like the gill slits of a fish. Such     slits are-- with one or two remarkable exceptions outside the     sub-kingdom-- distinctly vertebrate features, and remain, of course,     in fishes throughout life.    The presence of true cartilage and bone mark a vertebrate, but  vertebrata occur in which -these tissues- [bone] -are- [is] absent.      Section 146. The rabbit shares the following features with all the  vertebrata, except the true fishes, which do not possess any of them--       (a) Lungs (but many fish have a swimming bladder which answers     to the lungs in its anatomical relations.)       (b) Limbs which consist of a proximal joint of one bone an     intermediate part of two, and a distal portion which has five     digits, or is evidently a reduced form of the five-digit limb.*       (c) The absence of a median fin supported by fin rays.**       * The frog shows indications of a sixth digit.     ** The frog's tadpole has a median fin, but no fin rays.      Section 147. The rabbit shares the following features with all the  vertebrata above the fishes and amphibia (= frogs, toads, newts,  and etc.)--       (a) Absence of gills (not gill slits, note) at any stage in     development.       (b) An amnion, and       (c) An allantois in development.    The meaning of (b) and (c) we shall explain to the student in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21783"],[0,"A Manual of Pronunciation (#14)"],[1,"|   |   |   |   |  =sacrifice= _n._
