Others had secured minor  government positions, and still another large class was there in the  hope of securing Federal positions. A number of coloured men--some of  them very strong and brilliant--were in the House of Representatives  at that time, and one, the Hon. B.K. Bruce, was in the Senate. All  this tended to make Washington an attractive place for members of the  coloured race. Then, too, they knew that at all times they could have  the protection of the law in the District of Columbia. The public  schools in Washington for coloured people were better then than they  were elsewhere. I took great interest in studying the life of our people  there closely at that time. I found that while among them there was  a large element of substantial, worthy citizens, there was also a  superficiality about the life of a large class that greatly alarmed me.  I saw young coloured men who were not earning more than four dollars a  week spend two dollars or more for a buggy on Sunday to ride up and down  Pennsylvania Avenue in, in order that they might try to convince the  world that they were worth thousands. I saw other young men who received  seventy-five or one hundred dollars per month from the Government, who  were in debt at the end of every month. I saw men who but a few months  previous were members of Congress, then without employment and in  poverty. Among a large class there seemed to be a dependence upon the  Government for every conceivable thing. The members of this class had  little ambition to create a position for themselves, but wanted the  Federal officials to create one for them. How many times I wished then,  and have often wished since, that by some power of magic I might remove  the great bulk of these people into the county districts and plant them  upon the soil, upon the solid and never deceptive foundation of Mother  Nature, where all nations and races that have ever succeeded have gotten  their start,--a start that at first may be slow and toilsome, but one  that nevertheless is real.    In Washington I saw girls whose mothers were earning their living by  laundrying. These girls were taught by their mothers, in rather a crude  way it is true, the industry of laundrying. Later, these girls entered  the public schools and remained there perhaps six or eight years. When  the public school course was finally finished, they wanted more costly  dresses, more costly hats and shoes. In a word, while their wants  have been increased, their ability to supply their wants had not been  increased in the same degree. On the other hand, their six or eight  years of book education had weaned them away from the occupation of  their mothers. The result of this was in too many cases that the girls  went to the bad. I often thought how much wiser it would have been to  give these girls the same amount of maternal training--and I favour any  kind of training, whether in the languages or mathematics, that gives  strength and culture to the mind--but at the same time to give them the  most thorough training in the latest and best methods of laundrying and  other kindred occupations.        Chapter VI. Black Race And Red Race    During the year that I spent in Washington, and for some little time  before this, there had been considerable agitation in the state of  West Virginia over the question of moving the capital of the state  from Wheeling to some other central point. As a result of this, the  Legislature designated three cities to be voted upon by the citizens of  the state as the permanent seat of government. Among these cities was  Charleston, only five miles from Malden, my home. At the close of my  school year in Washington I was very pleasantly surprised to receive,  from a committee of three white people in Charleston, an invitation  to canvass the state in the interests of that city. This invitation I  accepted, and spent nearly three months in speaking in various parts of  the state. Charleston was successful in winning the prize, and is now  the permanent seat of government.    The reputation that I made as a speaker during this campaign induced a  number of persons to make an earnest effort to get me to enter political  life, but I refused, still believing that I could find other service  which would prove of more permanent value to my race. Even then I had a  strong feeling that what our people most needed was to get a foundation  in education, industry, and property, and for this I felt that they  could better afford to strive than for political preferment. As for my  individual self, it appeared to me to be reasonably certain that I could  succeed in political life, but I had a feeling that it would be a rather  selfish kind of success--individual success at the cost of failing to do  my duty in assisting in laying a foundation for the masses.    At this period in the progress of our race a very large proportion of  the young men who went to school or to college did so with the expressed  determination to prepare themselves to be great lawyers, or Congressmen,  and many of the women planned to become music teachers; but I had a  reasonably fixed idea, even at that early period in my life, that there  was a need for something to be done to prepare the way for successful  lawyers, Congressmen, and music teachers.    I felt that the conditions were a good deal like those of an old  coloured man, during the days of slavery, who wanted to learn how to  play on the guitar. In his desire to take guitar lessons he applied to  one of his young masters to teach him, but the young man, not having  much faith in the ability of the slave to master the guitar at his age,  sought to discourage him by telling him: \"Uncle Jake, I will give you  guitar lessons; but, Jake, I will have to charge you three dollars for  the first lesson, two dollars for the second lesson, and one dollar for  the third lesson. But I will charge you only twenty-five cents for the  last lesson.\"    Uncle Jake answered: \"All right, boss, I hires you on dem terms. But,  boss! I wants yer to be sure an' give me dat las' lesson first.\"    Soon after my work in connection with the removal of the capital was  finished, I received an invitation which gave me great joy and which  at the same time was a very pleasant surprise. This was a letter  from General Armstrong, inviting me to return to Hampton at the next  Commencement to deliver what was called the \"post-graduate address.\"  This was an honour which I had not dreamed of receiving. With much  care I prepared the best address that I was capable of. I chose for my  subject \"The Force That Wins.\"    As I returned to Hampton for the purpose of delivering this address,  I went over much of the same ground--now, however, covered entirely by  railroad--that I had traversed nearly six years before, when I first  sought entrance into Hampton Institute as a student. Now I was able to  ride the whole distance in the train. I was constantly contrasting this  with my first journey to Hampton. I think I may say, without seeming  egotism, that it is seldom that five years have wrought such a change in  the life and aspirations of an individual.    At Hampton I received a warm welcome from teachers and students. I found  that during my absence from Hampton the institute each year had been  getting closer to the real needs and conditions of our people; that the  industrial teaching, as well as that of the academic department, had  greatly improved. The plan of the school was not modelled after that of  any other institution then in existence, but every improvement was made  under the magnificent leadership of General Armstrong solely with the  view of meeting and helping the needs of our people as they presented  themselves at the time. Too often, it seems to me, in missionary  and educational work among underdeveloped races, people yield to the  temptation of doing that which was done a hundred years before, or is  being done in other communities a thousand miles away. The temptation  often is to run each individual through a certain educational  mould, regardless of the condition of the subject or the end to be  accomplished. This was not so at Hampton Institute.    The address which I delivered on Commencement Day seems to have pleased  every one, and many kind and encouraging words were spoken to me  regarding it. Soon after my return to my home in West Virginia, where  I had planned to continue teaching, I was again surprised to receive a  letter from General Armstrong, asking me to return to Hampton partly as  a teacher and partly to pursue some supplementary studies. This was  in the summer of 1879. Soon after I began my first teaching in West  Virginia I had picked out four of the brightest and most promising of my  pupils, in addition to my two brothers, to whom I have already referred,  and had given them special attention, with the view of having them go  to Hampton. They had gone there, and in each case the teachers had found  them so well prepared that they entered advanced classes. This fact, it  seems, led to my being called back to Hampton as a teacher. One of  the young men that I sent to Hampton in this way is now Dr. Samuel E.  Courtney, a successful physician in Boston, and a member of the School  Board of that city.    About this time the experiment was being tried for the first time, by  General Armstrong, of educating Indians at Hampton. Few people then had  any confidence in the ability of the Indians to receive education and  to profit by it. General Armstrong was anxious to try the experiment  systematically on a large scale. He secured from the reservations in  the Western states over one hundred wild and for the most part perfectly  ignorant Indians, the greater proportion of whom were young men. The  special work which the General desired me to do was to be a sort of \"house  father\" to the Indian young men--that is, I was to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#14)"],[1,"it is necessary in picking up something new always to drop something  old, as if one were an awkward, butter-fingered parcel-carrier.    If a composer writes empty stuff in the latest styles, he is one  degree better than the purveyor of trite stuff in the old styles; but  he is nobody before the high thinker who finds himself suited by the  general methods of the classic writers.    The most classic of our composers is their venerable dean, John  Knowles Paine. It is an interesting proof of the youth of our native  school of music, that the principal symphony, \"Spring,\" of our first  composer of importance, was written only twenty-one years ago. Before  Mr. Paine there had never been an American music writer worthy of  serious consideration in the larger forms.    By a mere coincidence Joachim Raff had written a symphony called  \"Spring\" in 1878, just a year before Paine finished his in America.  The first movement in both is called \"Nature's Awakening;\" such an  idea is inevitable in any spring composition, from poetry up--or down.  For a second movement Raff has a wild \"Walpurgis Night Revel,\" while  Paine has a scherzo called \"May Night Fantasy.\" Where Raff is uncanny  and fiendish, Paine is cheerful and elfin. The third movement of  Raff's symphony is called \"First Blossoms of Spring,\" and the last is  called \"The Joys of Wandering.\" The latter two movements of Mr.  Paine's symphony are \"A Promise of Spring\" and \"The Glory of Nature.\"  The beginning of both symphonies is, of course, a slow introduction  representing the torpid gloom of winter, out of which spring aspires  and ascends.    Paine's symphony, though aiming to shape the molten gold of April  fervor in the rigid mold of the symphonic form, has escaped every  appearance of mechanism and restraint. It is program music of the most  legitimate sort, in full accord with Beethoven's canon, \"Mehr Ausdruck  der Empfindung als Malerei.\" It has no aim of imitating springtime  noises, but seeks to stimulate by suggestion the hearer's creative  imagination, and provoke by a musical telepathy the emotions that  swayed the nympholept composer.        The first movement of the symphony has an introduction      containing two motives distinct from the two subjects of the      movement. These motives represent Winter and the Awakening.      The Winter motive may be again divided into a chill and icy      motif and a rushing wind-motif. Through these the timid      Awakening spirit lifts its head like the first trillium of      the year. There is a silence and a stealthy flutter of the      violins as if a cloud of birds were playing courier to the      Spring.        Suddenly, after a little prelude, as if a bluebird were      tuning his throat, we are enveloped in the key of the      symphony (A major) and the Spring runs lilting up the 'cellos      to the violins (which are divided in the naif archaic      interval of the tenth, too much ignored in our over-colored      harmonies). The second subject is propounded by the oboes      (in the rather unusual related key of the submediant). This      is a lyrical and dancing idea, and it does battle with the      underground resistance of the Winter motives. There is an      elaborate conclusion of fiercest joy. Its ecstasy droops, and      after a little flutter as of little wings, the elaboration      opens with the Spring motive in the minor. In this part,      scholarship revels in its own luxury, the birds quiver about      our heads again, and the reprise begins (in A major of      course) with new exultance, the dancing second subject      appears (in the tonic), overwhelming the failing strength of      the Winter with a cascade of delight. Then the conclusion      rushes in; this I consider one of the most joyous themes ever      inspired.        There is a coda of vanishing bird-wings and throats, a      pizzicato chord on the strings--and Spring has had her      coronation.        \"The May Night Fantasy\" is a moonlit revel of elves caught by      a musical reporter, a surreptitious \"chiel amang 'em takin'      notes.\" A single hobgoblin bassoon croaks ludicrously away,      the pixies darkle and flirt and dance their hearts out of      them.        The Romance is in rondo form with love-lorn iteration of      themes and intermezzo, and deftest broidery, the whole      ending, after a graceful Recollection, in a bliss of harmony.        The Finale is a halleluiah. It is on the sonata formula,      without introduction (the second subject being not in the      dominant of A major, but in C major, that chaste, frank key      which one of the popes strangely dubbed \"lascivious\"). The      elaboration is frenetic with strife, but the reprise is a      many-hued rainbow after storm, and the coda in A major      (ending a symphony begun in A minor) is swift with delight.    This symphony has been played much, but not half enough. It should  resist the weariness of time as immortally as Fletcher's play, \"The  Two Noble Kinsmen\" (in which Shakespeare's hand is glorious), for it  is, to quote that drama, \"fresher than May, sweeter than her gold  buttons on the bough, or all th'enamell'd knacks o' the mead or  garden.\"    John Knowles Paine is a name that has been held in long and high  honor among American composers. He was about the earliest of native  writers to convince foreign musicians that some good could come out of  Nazareth.    He was born in Portland, Me., January 9, 1839. He studied music first  under a local teacher, Kotzschmar, making his debut as organist at the  age of eighteen. A year later he was in Berlin, where for three years  he studied the organ, composition, instrumentation, and singing under  Haupt, Wieprecht, and others. He gave several organ concerts in  Germany, and made a tour in 1865-1866. In February, 1867, his \"Mass\"  was given at the Berlin Singakademie, Paine conducting. Then he came  back to the States, and in 1872 was appointed to an instructorship of  music at Harvard, whence he was promoted in 1876 to a full  professorship, a chair created for him and occupied by him ever since  with distinguished success.    His first symphony was brought out by Theodore Thomas in 1876. This  and his other orchestral works have been frequently performed at  various places in this country and abroad.    His only oratorio, \"St. Peter,\" was first produced at Portland in  1873, and in Boston a year later. It is a work of great power and much  dramatic strength. Upton, in his valuable work, \"Standard Oratorios,\"  calls it \"from the highest standpoint the only oratorio yet produced  in this country.\"    This oratorio, while containing much of the floridity and repetition  of Haendel at his worst, is also marked with the erudition and  largeness of Haendel at his best. The aria for St. Peter, \"O God, My  God, Forsake Me Not,\" is especially fine.    A much-played symphonic poem is Paine's \"The Tempest,\" which develops  musically the chief episodes of Shakespeare's play. He has also  written a valuable overture to \"As You Like It;\" he has set Keats'  \"Realm of Fancy\" exquisitely, and Milton's \"Nativity.\" And he has  written a grand opera on a mediaeval theme to his own libretto. This is  a three-act work called \"Azara;\" the libretto has been published by  the Riverside Press, and is to be translated into German. This has not  yet been performed. Being, unfortunately, an American grand opera, it  takes very little acuteness of foresight to predict a long wait before  it is ever heard. In it Paine has shown himself more a romanticist  than a classicist, and the work is said to be full of modernity.    Paine wrote the music for Whittier's \"Hymn,\" used to open the  Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and was fitly chosen to write  the Columbus March and Hymn for the opening ceremonies of the World's  Fair, at Chicago, October 21, 1892. This was given by several thousand  performers under the direction of Theodore Thomas.    A most original and interesting work is the chorus, \"Phoebus, Arise.\"  It seems good to hark back for words to old William Drummond \"of  Hawthornden.\" The exquisite flavor of long-since that marks the poetry  is conserved in the tune. While markedly original, it smacks agreeably  of the music of Harry Lawes, that nightingale of the seventeenth  century, whose fancies are too much neglected nowadays.    Paine's strong point is his climaxes, which are never timid, and are  often positively titanic, thrilling. The climax of this chorus is  notably superb, and the voices hold for two measures after the  orchestra finishes. The power of this effect can be easily imagined.  This work is marked, to an unusual extent, with a sensuousness of  color.    The year eighteen hundred eighty-one saw the first production of what  is generally considered Paine's most important composition, and by  some called the best work by an American,--his setting of the choruses  of the \"Oedipus Tyrannos\" of Sophokles. It was written for the  presentation by Harvard University, and has been sung, in whole or in  part, very frequently since. This masterpiece of Grecian genius is so  mighty in conception and so mighty in execution that it has not lost  power at all in the long centuries since it first thrilled the Greeks.  To realize its possibilities musically is to give proof enough of the  very highest order of genius,--a genius akin to that of Sophokles. It  may be said that in general Paine has completely fulfilled his  opportunities.    Mendelssohn also set two Greek tragedies to music, Sophokles' \"Oedipus  in Kolonos\" and his \"Antigone.\" Mendelssohn is reported to have made a  first attempt at writing Grecian music, or what we suppose it to be,  mainly a matter of unison and meagre instrumentation. He was soon  dissuaded from such a step, however, and wisely. The Greek tragedians,  really writers of grand opera, made undoubted use of the best musical  implements and knowledge they had.
