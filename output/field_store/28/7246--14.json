Most  Englishmen know a good deal of American fiction, and nothing whatever of  American history. They know more about the autocrat of the  breakfast-table than about the autocrat of the army and the people, the  one great democratic despot of modern times; the Napoleon of the New  World. The only notion the English public ever got about American  politics they got from a novel, _Uncle Tom's Cabin_; and to say the  least of it, it was no exception to the prevalence of fiction over fact.  Hundreds of us have heard of Tom Sawyer for one who has heard of Charles  Sumner; and it is probable that most of us could pass a more detailed  examination about Toddy and Budge than about Lincoln and Lee. But in  the case of Andrew Jackson it may be that I felt a special sense of  individual isolation; for I believe that there are even fewer among  Englishmen than among Americans who realise that the energy of that  great man was largely directed towards saving us from the chief evil  which destroys the nations to-day. He sought to cut down, as with a  sword of simplicity, the new and nameless enormity of finance; and he  must have known, as by a lightning flash, that the people were behind  him, because all the politicians were against him. The end of that  struggle is not yet; but if the bank is stronger than the sword or the  sceptre of popular sovereignty, the end will be the end of democracy. It  will have to choose between accepting an acknowledged dictator and  accepting dictation which it dare not acknowledge. The process will have  begun by giving power to people and refusing to give them their titles;  and it will have ended by giving the power to people who refuse to give  us their names.    But I have a special reason for ending this chapter on the name of the  great popular dictator who made war on the politicians and the  financiers. This chapter does not profess to touch on one in twenty of  the interesting cities of America, even in this particular aspect of  their relation to the history of America, which is so much neglected in  England. If that were so, there would be a great deal to say even about  the newest of them; Chicago, for instance, is certainly something more  than the mere pork-packing yard that English tradition suggests; and it  has been building a boulevard not unworthy of its splendid position on  its splendid lake. But all these cities are defiled and even diseased  with industrialism. It is due to the Americans to remember that they  have deliberately preserved one of their cities from such defilement and  such disease. And that is the presidential city, which stands in the  American mind for the same ideal as the President; the idea of the  Republic that rises above modern money-getting and endures. There has  really been an effort to keep the White House white. No factories are  allowed in that town; no more than the necessary shops are tolerated. It  is a beautiful city; and really retains something of that classical  serenity of the eighteenth century in which the Fathers of the Republic  moved. With all respect to the colonial place of that name, I do not  suppose that Wellington is particularly like Wellington. But Washington  really is like Washington.    In this, as in so many things, there is no harm in our criticising  foreigners, if only we would also criticise ourselves. In other words,  the world might need even less of its new charity, if it had a little  more of the old humility. When we complain of American individualism, we  forget that we have fostered it by ourselves having far less of this  impersonal ideal of the Republic or commonwealth as a whole. When we  complain, very justly, for instance, of great pictures passing into the  possession of American magnates, we ought to remember that we paved the  way for it by allowing them all to accumulate in the possession of  English magnates. It is bad that a public treasure should be in the  possession of a private man in America, but we took the first step in  lightly letting it disappear into the private collection of a man in  England. I know all about the genuine national tradition which treated  the aristocracy as constituting the state; but these very foreign  purchases go to prove that we ought to have had a state independent of  the aristocracy. It is true that rich Americans do sometimes covet the  monuments of our culture in a fashion that rightly revolts us as vulgar  and irrational. They are said sometimes to want to take whole buildings  away with them; and too many of such buildings are private and for sale.  There were wilder stories of a millionaire wishing to transplant  Glastonbury Abbey and similar buildings as if they were portable shrubs  in pots. It is obvious that it is nonsense as well as vandalism to  separate Glastonbury Abbey from Glastonbury. I can understand a man  venerating it as a ruin; and I can understand a man despising it as a  rubbish-heap. But it is senseless to insult a thing in order to  idolatrise it; it is meaningless to desecrate the shrine in order to  worship the stones. That sort of thing is the bad side of American  appetite and ambition; and we are perfectly right to see it not only as  a deliberate blasphemy but as an unconscious buffoonery. But there is  another side to the American tradition, which is really too much lacking  in our own tradition. And it is illustrated in this idea of preserving  Washington as a sort of paradise of impersonal politics without personal  commerce. Nobody could buy the White House or the Washington Monument;  it may be hinted (as by an inhabitant of Glastonbury) that nobody wants  to; but nobody could if he did want to. There is really a certain air of  serenity and security about the place, lacking in every other American  town. It is increased, of course, by the clear blue skies of that  half-southern province, from which smoke has been banished. The effect  is not so much in the mere buildings, though they are classical and  often beautiful. But whatever else they have built, they have built a  great blue dome, the largest dome in the world. And the place does  express something in the inconsistent idealism of this strange people;  and here at least they have lifted it higher than all the sky-scrapers,  and set it in a stainless sky.          _In the American Country_      The sharpest pleasure of a traveller is in finding the things which he  did not expect, but which he might have expected to expect. I mean the  things that are at once so strange and so obvious that they must have  been noticed, yet somehow they have not been noted. Thus I had heard a  thousand things about Jerusalem before I ever saw it; I had heard  rhapsodies and disparagements of every description. Modern rationalistic  critics, with characteristic consistency, had blamed it for its  accumulated rubbish and its modern restoration, for its antiquated  superstition and its up-to-date vulgarity. But somehow the one  impression that had never pierced through their description was the  simple and single impression of a city on a hill, with walls coming to  the very edge of slopes that were almost as steep as walls; the turreted  city which crowns a cone-shaped hill in so many mediaeval landscapes.  One would suppose that this was at once the plainest and most  picturesque of all the facts; yet somehow, in my reading, I had always  lost it amid a mass of minor facts that were merely details. We know  that a city that is set upon a hill cannot be hid; and yet it would seem  that it is exactly the hill that is hid; though perhaps it is only hid  from the wise and the understanding. I had a similar and simple  impression when I discovered America. I cannot avoid the phrase; for it  would really seem that each man discovers it for himself.    Thus I had heard a great deal, before I saw them, about the tall and  dominant buildings of New York. I agree that they have an instant effect  on the imagination; which I think is increased by the situation in which  they stand, and out of which they arose. They are all the more  impressive because the building, while it is vertically so vast, is  horizontally almost narrow. New York is an island, and has all the  intensive romance of an island. It is a thing of almost infinite height  upon very finite foundations. It is almost like a lofty lighthouse upon  a lonely rock. But this story of the sky-scrapers, which I had often  heard, would by itself give a curiously false impression of the freshest  and most curious characteristic of American architecture. Told only in  terms of these great towers of stone and brick in the big industrial  cities, the story would tend too much to an impression of something cold  and colossal like the monuments of Asia. It would suggest a modern  Babylon altogether too Babylonian. It would imply that a man of the new  world was a sort of new Pharaoh, who built not so much a pyramid as a  pagoda of pyramids. It would suggest houses built by mammoths out of  mountains; the cities reared by elephants in their own elephantine  school of architecture. And New York does recall the most famous of all  sky-scrapers--the tower of Babel. She recalls it none the less because  there is no doubt about the confusion of tongues. But in truth the very  reverse is true of most of the buildings in America. I had no sooner  passed out into the suburbs of New York on the way to Boston than I  began to see something else quite contrary and far more curious. I saw  forests upon forests of small houses stretching away to the horizon as  literal forests do; villages and towns and cities. And they were, in  another sense, literally like forests. They were all made of wood. It  was almost as fantastic to an English eye as if they had been all made  of cardboard. I had long outlived the silly old joke that referred to  Americans as if they all lived in the backwoods. But, in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27262"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 3, May 1906 (#14)"],[1,"pay the rent and  fix matters with the landlord.\" The good soul did not understand much  about painting, about tones and values, but merely wanted to get the old  man into a more cheerful room.    It was difficult for old Melville to take leave of his studio, in which  he had seen a quarter of a century roll by, which he had entered as a  man in the best years of his life, and now left as an old man; but when  he had moved into the new room, the walls of which were an agreeable  gray, he exclaimed, \"How nice and light!\" After arranging his few  earthly possessions, he brought out a new canvas, opened a side window,  sat down once more before his easel, and gazed intently at the sunshine  streaming in and playing on the newly painted and varnished floor.    For years he had wielded the brush every day, but on this day he somehow  could not paint; he could not find the right harmony. He at first  attributed it to a cold which he had contracted, but later on, irritated  and somewhat frightened, he mumbled to himself, \"I fear I can't paint in  this room.\" And thus he sat musing at his easel with the blank canvas  before him, blank as once his youth had been, full of possibilities of a  successful career, when suddenly an inspiration came upon him. He saw  before him the orchard of his father's little Canadian farm, with the  old apple trees in bloom, bathed in the sweet and subtle sunlight of  spring, a scene that for years had lain hidden among the faint, almost  forgotten memories of his childhood days, but now by some trick of  memory was conjured up with appalling distinctiveness. This he wished to  realize in paint, and should he perish in the effort!    Feverishly he seized his palette and brushes, for hours and hours he  painted--the sunlight had long vanished from his studio floor, a chill  wind blew through the open window and played with his gray locks--and  when the brush at last glided from his hand he had accomplished his  lifelong aim--he had painted sunshine.    Slowly he sank back in his chair, the arms hanging limp at his sides,  and his chin falling on his chest, an attitude a painter might adopt  gazing at a masterpiece he had just accomplished--in this case old  Melville's painting hours were over for evermore, his eyes could no  longer see the colors of this world. Like a soldier he had died at his  post of duty, and serene happiness over this final victory lay on his  features. In every life some ideal happiness is hidden, which may be  found, and for which we should prospect all our days. Old Melville had  attained his little bit of sunshine rather late in life, but he had  called it his own, at least for however short a moment, while most of us  others, whom life treats less scurvily, blinded by foolish and selfish  desire, cannot even succeed in grasping material happiness, which  crosses our roads quite often enough and stands at times right near us,  without being recognized.    And the fate of old Melville's pictures? Who knows if they may not some  day, when their colors have mellowed, be discovered in some garret, and  re-enter the art world in a more dignified manner? True enough, they  will not set the world on fire, yet they may be at least appreciated as  the sincere efforts of a man who loved his art above all else, and,  despite deficiencies, had a keen understanding for nature and  considerable ability to express it. Whatever their future may be, his  work has not been in vain. It is the cruel law of human life that  hundreds of men must drudge their whole lives away in order that one may  succeed, not a bit better than they; in the same way in art, hundreds of  talents must struggle and suffer in vain that one may reach the  cloud-wrapped summit of popularity and fame. And that road is sure to  lead over many corpses, and many of the nobler altruistic qualities of  man have to be left far behind in the valley of unknown names.    Life was brutal to you, old Melville! But this way or that way, what is  the difference?    [Illustration]    There was a time when in the name of God and of true faith in Him men  were destroyed, tortured, executed, beaten in scores and hundreds of  thousands. We, from the height of our attainments, now look down upon  the men who did these things.    But we are wrong. Amongst us there are many such people, the difference  lies only here--that those men of old did these things then in the name  of God, and of His true service, whilst now those who commit the same  evil amongst us do so in the name of \"the people,\" \"for the true service  of the people.\"--_Leo Tolstoy._           *       *       *       *       *    +Books to be had through Mother Earth+    +The Doukhobors:+ Their History in Russia; Their Migration to Canada.
