In 1468, the  estimates for the Duke of Clarence's household expenses give these  prices, among others:                                          s.   d.           £    s.   d.

Possibly they  were half the size and half the weight. Still, I have referred the  question to Professor Thorold Rogers, author of the _History of Prices_  1250-1400 A.D., and he says:      \"In the year to which you refer (1478) bread was very dear, 50 per    cent. above the average. But on the whole, wheat prices in the    15th century were lower than in the 14th. Fenn's calculation,    a little below the mark for wheat, is still less below it in most    of the second necessaries of life. The multiple of wheat is about    9, that of meat at least 24, those of butter and cheese nearly as    much. But that of clothing is not more than 6, that of linen from    4 to 5. Taking however one thing with another, 12 is a safe    general multiplier.\"    This would make the cost of young Paston's university education £150  11s. 6d. a year.    Mr Whiston would raise Fenn's estimate of £100 to £200. He says that  the rent of land in Kent in 1540 was a shilling or eighteenpence an  acre,--see _Valor Ecclesiasticus_,--and that the tithes and glebes of  the Dean and Chapter of Rochester, which were worth about £480 a-year in  1542, are now worth £19,000.    The remaining Oxford letter in the Paston volumes seems to allude to the  students bearing part of the expenses of the degree, or the feast at it,  of a person related to royal family.      \"I supposed, when that I sent my letter to my brother John, that    the Queen's brother should have proceeded at Midsummer, and    therefore I beseeched her to send me some money, _for it will be    some cost to me_, but not much.\"    The first school at Cambridge is said to have been founded by Edward the  Elder, the son of Alfred, but on no good authority. In 1223 the term  _University_ was applied to the place. The dates of the foundations of  its Colleges, as given in its Calendar, are:      St Peter's               1257      (date of charter, 1264)    Clare Hall               1326    Pembroke                 1347    Caius                    1349    Trinity Hall             1350    Corpus Christi           1351    King's                   1441    Queen's                  1446      (refounded 1465)    St Catherine's Hall      1473    Jesus                    1496    Christ's                 1505    St John's                1511    Magdalene                1519    Trinity                  1546    Emmanuel                 1584    Sidney                   1598    Downing                  1800        [Headnote: FEW NOBLEMEN AT CAMBRIDGE.]    Lord Henry Brandon, son of the Duke of Suffolk, died of the sweating  sickness then prevalent in the University, on the 16th July, 1551, while  a student of Cambridge. His brother, Lord Charles Brandon, died on the  same day. Their removal to Buckden was too late to save them (_Ath.  Cant._, i. 105, 541). Of them Ascham says, 'two noble Primeroses of  Nobilitie, the yong Duke of Suffolke and Lord _H. Matrevers_ were soch  two examples to the Courte for learnyng, as our tyme may rather wishe,  than look for agayne.'--_Scholemaster_, ed. Mayor, p. 62. Besides  these two young noblemen, the first 104 pages of Cooper's _Athenæ  Cantabrigienses_ disclose only one other, Lord Derby's son, and the  following names of sons of knights:[44]        CAMBRIDGE MEN.          1443      Thomas Rotherham, Fellow of King's, son of Sir Thomas Rotherham,      knight, and Alice his wife.          1494      Reginald Bray, high-steward of the university of Oxford, son of      Sir Richard Bray, knight, and the lady Joan his second wife.          1502      Humphrey Fitzwilliam, of Pembroke Hall, Vice-Chancellor, _appears_      to have been the son of Sir Richard Fitzwilliam of Ecclesfield,      and Elizabeth his wife.          ab. 1468      Richard Redman, son of Sir Richard Redman and Elizabeth [Aldburgh]      his wife; made Bp. of St Asaph.          1492      Thomas Savage, son of Sir John Savage, knight, Bp. of Rochester.      Was LL.D. ? educated at Cambridge.          1485      James Stanley, younger son of Thomas Earl of Derby, educated at      both universities, graduated at Cambridge, and became prebendary      of Holywell in 1485, Bp. of Ely in 1506.          1497      William Coningsby, son of Sir Humphrey Coningsby, elected from      Eton to King's.          1507      Thomas Elyot, son of Sir Richard Elyot, made M.A.          ab. 1520      George Blagge, son of Sir Robert Blagge.    Queen Elizabeth's favourite, Lord Essex, was at Trinity College,  Cambridge. See his letter of May 13, from there, in Ellis, series II. v.  iii. p. 73; the furniture of his room, and his expenses, in the note p.  73-4; and his Tutor's letter asking for new clothes for 'my Lord,' or  else 'he shall not onely be thrid bare, but ragged.'    Archbp. Whitgift[45], when B.D. at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, A.D. 1563,  \"bestowed some of his time and abilities in the instruction of ingenious  youth, sent to the college for education, in good learning and Christian  manners. And among such his pupils, were two noblemen's sons, viz. the  Lord Herbert, son and heir to the Earl of Pembroke; and John, son and  heir to the Lord North.\" (_Life_, by Strype, ed. 1822, vol. i. p. 14.)    While Whitgift was Master of Trinity, Strype says he had bred up under  him not only several Bishops, but also \"the Earls of Worcester and  Cumberland, the Lord Zouch, the Lord Dunboy of Ireland, Sir Nicolas and  Sir Francis Bacon. To which I may add one more, namely, the son of Sir  Nicolas White, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, who married a Devereux.\"  (_Life_, i. 157, ed. 1822.)        [Headnote: NOBLES AND GENTLEMEN AT OXFORD.]    A search through the whole of the first volume of Wood's _Athenæ  Oxonienses_, comprising a period of nearly 100 years, has resulted in  the following meagre list of men of noble or knightly birth who  distinguished themselves. There are besides many men of \"genteel  parents,\" some of trader-ones, many friars, some Winchester men, but no  Eton ones, educated at Oxford.          1478      Edmund Dudley, son of John Dudley, Esq., 2nd son of John Lord      Dudley, of Dudley Castle in Staffordshire.          ab. 1483      John Colet, the eldest son of Sir Henry Colet, twice lord mayor      of London ... was educated in grammaticals, partly in London or      Westminster.           \"      Nicholas Vaux, son of Sir Will.

Edw. IV.; in whose reign, and before, were the sons of divers      of the English nobility educated in academical literature in      Baliol Coll.,[46] wherein, as 'tis probable, this our author was      instructed also.          1497      Thomas More, son of Sir John More, knight. (_The_ Sir Thomas More.)          ? ab. 1510      George Bulleyn, son and heir of Sir Tho.

He was Jane      Seymour's brother, and afterwards Duke of Somerset, and was      beheaded on Jan. 22, 1552-3.          1534      John Philpot, son of Sir Pet. Philpot, knight of the Bath.

Many come to Norway to trade, but they seldom come to the  king's hall. I shall be glad to hear about your land. Come up and speak  with me.\"    So Leif went up the steps of the high seat and sat down by the king and  talked with him. When the feast was over the king said:    \"You shall live at my court this winter, Leif Ericsson. You are a  welcome guest.\"    So Leif stayed there that winter. When he started back in the spring,  the king gave him two thralls as a parting gift.    \"Let this gift show my love, Leif Ericsson,\" he said. \"For your sake I  shall not forget Greenland.\"    Leif sailed back again and had good luck until he was past Iceland. Then  great winds came out of the north and tossed his ship about so that the  men could do nothing. They were blown south for days and days. They did  not know where they were. Then they saw land, and Leif said:    \"Surely luck has brought us also to a new country. We will go in and see  what kind of a place it is.\"    So he steered for it. As they came near, the men said:    \"See the great trees and the soft, green shore. Surely this is a better  country than Greenland or than Iceland either.\"    When they landed they threw themselves upon the ground.    \"I never lay on a bed so soft as this grass,\" one said.    \"Taller trees do not grow in Norway,\" said another.    \"There is no stone here as in Norway, but only good black dirt,\" Leif  said. \"I never saw so fertile a land before.\"    The men were hungry and set about building a fire.    \"There is no lack of fuel here,\" they said.    They stayed many days in this country and walked about to see what was  there. A German, named Tyrker, was with Leif. He was a little man with a  high forehead and a short nose. His eyes were big and rolling. He had  lived with Eric for many years, and had taken care of Leif when he was a  little boy. So Leif loved him.    Now one day they had been wandering about and all came back to camp at  night except Tyrker. When Leif looked around on his comrades, he said:    \"Where is Tyrker?\"    No one knew. Then Leif was angry.    \"Is a man of so little value in this empty land that you would lose  one?\" he said. \"Why did you not keep together? Did you not see that he  was gone? Why did you not set out to look for him? Who knows what  terrible thing may have happened to him in these great forests?\"    Then he turned and started out to hunt for him. His men followed,  silent and ashamed. They had not gone far when they saw Tyrker running  toward them. He was laughing and talking to himself. Leif ran to him and  put his arms about him with gladness at seeing him.    [Illustration: \"_He pointed to the woods and laughed and rolled his  eyes_\"]    \"Why are you so late?\" he asked. \"Where have you been?\"    But Tyrker, still smiling and nodding his head, answered in German. He  pointed to the woods and laughed and rolled his eyes. Again Leif asked  his question and put his hand on Tyrker's shoulder as though he would  shake him. Then Tyrker answered in the language of Iceland:    \"I have not been so very far, but I have found something wonderful.\"    \"What is it?\" cried the men.    \"I have found grapes growing wild,\" answered Tyrker, and he laughed, and  his eyes shone.    \"It cannot be,\" Leif said.    Grapes do not grow in Greenland nor in Iceland nor even in Norway. So it  seemed a wonderful thing to these Norsemen.    \"Can I not tell grapes when I see them?\" cried Tyrker. \"Did I not grow  up in Germany, where every hillside is covered with grapevines? Ah! it  seems like my old home.\"    \"It is wonderful,\" Leif said. \"I have heard travelers tell of seeing  grapes growing, but I myself never saw it. You shall take us to them  early in the morning, Tyrker.\"    So in the morning they went back into the woods and saw the grapes. They  ate of them.    \"They are like food and drink,\" they cried.    That day Leif said:    \"We spent most of the summer on the ocean. Winter will soon be coming on  and the sea about Greenland will be frozen. We must start back. I mean  to take some of the things of this land to show to our people at home.  We will fill the rowboat with grapes and tow it behind us. The ship we  will load with logs from these great trees. That will be a welcome  shipload in Greenland, where we have neither trees nor vines. Now half  of you shall gather grapes for the next few days, and the other half  shall cut timber.\"    So they did, and after a week sailed off. The ship was full of lumber,  and they towed the rowboat loaded with grapes. As they looked back at  the shore, Leif said:    \"I will call this country Wineland for the grapes that grow there.\"    One of the men leaped upon the gunwale and leaned out, clinging to the  sail, and sang:        \"Wineland the good, Wineland the warm,      Wineland the green, the great, the fat.      Our dragon fed and crawls away      With belly stuffed and lazy feet.      How long her purple, trailing tail!      She fed and grew to twice her size.\"    Then all the men waved their hands to the shore and gave a great shout  for that good land.    For all that voyage they had fair weather and sailed into Eric's harbor  before the winter came. Eric saw the ship and ran down to the shore. He  took Leif into his arms and said:    \"Oh, my son, my old eyes ached to see you. I hunger to hear of all that  you have seen and done.\"    \"Luck has followed me all the way,\" said Leif. \"See what I have brought  home.\"    The Greenlanders looked.    \"Lumber! lumber!\" they cried. \"Oh! it is better stuff than gold.\"    Then they saw the grapes and tasted them.    \"Surely you must have plundered Asgard,\" they said, smacking their lips.    At the feast that night Eric said:    \"Leif shall sit in the place of honor.\"    So Leif sat in the high seat opposite Eric. All men thought him a  handsome and wise man. He told them of the storm and of Wineland.    \"No man would ever need a cloak there. The soil is richer than the soil  of Norway. Grain grows wild, and you yourselves saw the grapes that we  got from there. The forests are without end. The sea is full of fish.\"    The Greenlanders listened with open mouths to all this. They turned and  talked to Leif's ship-comrades who were scattered among them.    Leif noticed two strangers, an old man who sat at Eric's side and a  young woman on the cross-bench. He turned to his brother Thorstein who  sat next to him.    \"Who are these strangers?\" he asked.    \"Thorbiorn and his daughter Gudrid,\" Thorstein answered. \"They landed  here this spring. I never saw our father more glad of anything than to  see this Thorbiorn. They were friends before we left Iceland. When they  saw each other again they could not talk enough of old times. In the  spring Eric means to give him a farm up the fiord a way. It seems that  this Thorbiorn comes of a good family that has been rich and great in  Iceland for years. And Thorbiorn himself was rich when our father knew  him, and was much honored by all men. But ill luck came, and he grew  poor. This hurt his pride. 'I will not stay in Iceland and be a beggar,'  he said to himself. 'I will not have men look at me and say, \"He is not  what his father was.\" I will go to my friend Eric the Red in  Greenland.'    \"Then he got ready a great feast and invited all his friends. It was  such a feast as had not been in Iceland for years. Thorbiorn spent on it  all the wealth that he had left. For he said to himself, 'I will not  leave in shame. Men shall remember my last feast.' After that he set out  and came to Greenland.    \"Is not Gudrid beautiful? And she is wise. I mean to marry her, if her  father will permit it.\"    Now Leif settled down in Greenland and became a great man there. He was  so busy and he grew so rich that he did not think of going to Wineland  again. But people could not forget his story. Many nights as men sat  about the long fires they talked of that wonderful land and wished to  see it.    [Decoration]          [Illustration]    Wineland the Good      On an autumn, a year or two after Leif came home, Eric and his men saw  two large ships come to land not far down the shore from the house.    \"They look like trading ships,\" Eric said. \"Let us go down to see them.\"    \"I will go, too,\" Gudrid said. \"Perhaps they will have rich cloth and  jewelry. It is long since I had my eyes on a new dress.\"    So they all went down and found two large trading ships lying in the  water. A great many men were on the shore making a fire.    \"Welcome to Greenland!\" called Eric. \"What are your names and your  country?\"    Then a fine, big man walked out from among the men and went up to Eric.    \"I am Thorfinn,\" he said, \"a trader. I sailed this summer from Iceland  with forty men and a shipload of goods. On the sea I met this other  ship from Iceland. The master is Biarni. Come and look at my goods.\"    So he rowed Eric and Gudrid out and they went aboard his boat. Thorfinn  opened his chests and showed Eric gleaming swords and bracelets and axes  and farm tools. But before Gudrid he spread beautiful cloth and gold  embroidery and golden necklaces. As they looked, he told of doings in  Iceland and asked of Greenland.    \"We never see such things as these in this bare land,\" Gudrid said, as  she smoothed a beautiful dress of purple velvet. \"I envy the women of  Iceland their fair clothes.\"    \"There is no need of that,\" Thorfinn said, \"for this dress is yours and  anything else from my chests that you like. Here is a necklace that I  beg you to take. It did not have a fairer mistress in Greece where I got  it.\"    \"You are a very generous trader,\" Gudrid said.    Then Thorfinn gave Eric a great sword with a gold-studded scabbard.  After a while he took them to Biarni's ship. He also gave them gifts.  They all talked and laughed much while they were together.    \"You are merry comrades,\" Eric said. \"I ask you both and all your men to  spend the winter at my house. You can put your"]]]
