Westwood states that an allied fly  (Rhagio Columbaschensis) is one of the greatest scourges of man and  beast in Hungary, where it has been known to kill cattle.    [Illustration: 68. Black fly.]    [Illustration: 69. Black Fly Larva.]    The Simulium molestum (Fig. 68, enlarged), as the black fly is called,  lives during the larva state in the water. The larva of a Labrador  species (Fig. 69, enlarged) which we found, is about a quarter of an  inch long, and of the appearance here indicated. The pupa is also  aquatic, having long respiratory filaments attached to each side of the  front of the thorax. According to Westwood, \"the posterior part of its  body is enclosed in a semioval membranous cocoon, which is at first  formed by the larva, the anterior part of which is eaten away before  changing to a pupa, so as to be open in front. The imago is produced  beneath the surface of the water, its fine silky covering serving to  repel the action of the water.\"    [Illustration: 70. Mycetobia.]    Multitudes of a long, slender, white worm may often be found living in  the dirt, and sour sap running from wounds in the elm tree. Two summers  ago we discovered some of these larvae, and on rearing them found that  they were a species of Mycetobia (Fig. 70; _a_, larva; _b_, pupa). The  larva is remarkable for having the abdominal segments divided into two  portions, the hinder much smaller than the anterior division. Its whole  length is a little over a third of an inch. The pupae were found sticking  out in considerable numbers from the tree, being anchored by the little  spines at the tail. The head is square, ending in two horns, and the  body is straight and covered with spines, especially towards the end of  the tail. They were a fifth of an inch in length. The last of June the  flies appeared, somewhat resembling gnats, and about a line long. The  worms continued to infest the tree for six weeks, the flies remaining  either upon or near it.    [Illustration: 71. Mouth Parts of Tabanus.]    We now come to that terror of our equine friends, the Horse fly, Gad, or  Breeze fly. In its larval state, some species live in water, and in damp  places under stones and pieces of wood, and others in the earth away  from water, where they feed on animal, and, probably, on decaying  matter. Mr. B. D. Walsh found an aquatic larva of this genus, which,  within a short time, devoured eleven water snails. Thus at this stage of  existence, this fly, often so destructive, even at times killing our  horses, is beneficial. During the hotter parts of summer, and when the  sun is shining brightly, thousands of these Horse flies appear on our  marshes and inland prairies. There are many different kinds, over one  hundred species of the genus Tabanus alone, living in North America. Our  most common species is the \"Green head,\" or Tabanus lineola. When about  to bite, it settles quietly down upon the hand, face or foot, it matters  not which, and thrusts its formidable lancet-like jaws deep into the  flesh. Its bite is very painful, as we can testify from personal  experience. We were told during the last summer that a horse, which  stood fastened to a tree in a field near the marshes at Rowley, Mass.,  was bitten to death by these Green heads; and it is known that horses  and cattle are occasionally killed by their repeated harassing bites. In  cloudy weather they do not fly, and they perish on the cool frosty  nights of September. The Timb, or Tsetze fly, is a species of this group  of flies, and while it does not attack man, plagues to death, and is  said to poison by its bite, the cattle in certain districts of the  interior of Africa, thus almost barring out explorers. On comparing the  mouth-parts of the Horse fly (Fig. 71, mouth of T. lineola), we have all  the parts seen in the mosquito, but greatly modified. Like the mosquito,  the females alone bite, the male Horse fly being harmless, and  frequenting flowers, living upon their sweets. The labrum (_lb_),  mandibles (_m_) and maxillae (_mx_), are short, stiff and lancet-like,  and the maxillary palpi (_mp_; _a_, the five terminal joints of the  antennae) are large, stout, and two-jointed. While the jaws (both maxillae  and mandibles) are thrust into the flesh, the tongue (_l_) spreads  around the tube thus formed by the lancets, and pumps up the blood  flowing from the wound, by aid of the sucking stomach, or crop, being a  sac appended to the throat. Other Gad flies, but much smaller, though as  annoying to us in woods and fields, are the species of Golden eyed  flies, Chrysops, which fly and buzz interminably about our ears, often  taking a sudden nip. They plague cattle, settling upon them and drawing  their blood at their leisure.    [Illustration: 72. Carpet Fly.]    [Illustration: 73. Carpet Worm.]    We turn to a comparatively unknown insect, which has occasionally  excited some distrust in the minds of housekeepers. It is the carpet  fly, Scenopinus pallipes (Fig. 72), which, in the larva state, is found  under carpets, on which it is said to feed. The worm (Fig. 73) has a  long, white, cylindrical body, divided into twelve segments, exclusive  of the head, while the first eight abdominal segments are divided by a  transverse suture, so that there appear to be seventeen abdominal  segments, the sutures appearing too distinct in the cut. Mr. F. G.  Sanborn has reared the fly, here figured, from the worm. The larva also  lives in rotten wood; it is too scarce ever to prove very destructive in  houses. Either this or a similar fly was once found, we are told by a  scientific friend, in great numbers in a \"rat\" used in dressing a young  lady's hair; the worms were living upon the hair stuffing.    One of the most puzzling objects to the collector of shells or insects,  is the almost spherical larva of Microdon globosus (Fig. 74). It is  flattened and smooth beneath and seems to adhere to the under side of  stones, where it might be mistaken for a snail.    The Syrphus fly, or Aphis eater, deserves more than the passing notice  which we bestow upon it. The maggot (Fig. 75, in the act of devouring an  Aphis) is to be sought for established in a group of plant lice (Aphis),  which it seizes by means of the long extensible front part of the body.  The adult fly (Fig. 76) is gayly spotted and banded with yellow,  resembling closely a wasp. It frequents flowers.    [Illustration: 74. Microdon.]    [Illustration: 75. Syrphus Larva.] 76. Syrphus Fly.]    [Illustration: 77. Larva of Rat-tailed Fly. 78. Rat-tailed Fly and its  Pupa.]    The singular rat-tailed pupa-case of Eristalis (Fig. 77) lives in water,  and when in want of air, protrudes its long respiratory tube out into  the air. We present the figure of an allied fly, Merodon Bardus (Fig.  78; _a_, puparium, natural size). We will not describe at length the  fly, as the admirable drawings of Mr. Emerton cannot fail to render it  easily recognizable. The larva is much like the puparium or pupa case,  here figured, which closely resembles that of Eristalis, in possessing  along respiratory filament, showing that the maggot undoubtedly lives in  the water, and when desirous of breathing, protrudes the tube out of the  water, thus drawing in air enough to fill its internal respiratory tubes  (tracheae). The Merodon Narcissa probably lives in the soil, or in rotten  wood, as the pupa-case has no respiratory tube, having instead a very  short, sessile, truncated tube, scarcely as long as it is thick. The  case itself is cylindrical, and rounded alike at each end.    [Illustration: 79. Human Bot Worm.]    We now come to the Bot flies, which are among the most extraordinary, in  their habits, of all insects. The history of the Bot flies is in brief  thus. The adult two-winged fly lays its eggs on the exterior of the  animal to be infested. They are conveyed into the interior of the host,  where they hatch, and the worm or maggot lives by sucking in the  purulent matter, caused by the irritation set up by its presence in its  host; or else the worm itself, after hatching, bores under the skin.  When fully grown, it quits the body and finishes its transformations to  the fly-state under ground. Many quadrupeds, from mice, squirrels, and  rabbits, up to the ox, horse, and even the rhinoceros, suffer from their  attacks, while man himself is not exempt. The body of the adult fly is  stout and hairy, and it is easily recognized by having the opening of  the mouth very small, the mouth-parts being very rudimentary. The larvae  are, in general, thick, fleshy, footless grubs, consisting of eleven  segments, exclusive of the head, which are covered with rows of spines  and tubercles, by which they move about within the body, thus irritating  the animals in which they take up their abode. The breathing pores  (stigmata) open in a scaly plate at the posterior end of the body. The  mouth-parts (mandibles, etc.) of the subcutaneous larvae consist of  fleshy tubercles, while in those species which live in the stomachs and  frontal sinuses of their host, they are armed with horny hooks.    [Illustration: 80. Horse Bot Fly.]    The larvae attain their full size after moulting twice. Just before  assuming the pupa state, the maggot leaves its peculiar dwelling place,  descends into the ground and there becomes a pupa, though retaining its  larval skin, which serves as a protection to it, whence it is called a  \"puparium.\"    Several well-authenticated instances are on record of a species of bot  fly inhabiting the body of man, in Central and South America, producing  painful tumors under the skin of the arm, legs and abdomen. It is still  under dispute whether this human bot fly is a true or accidental  parasite, the more probable opinion being that its proper host is the  monkey or dog. In Cayenne, this revolting grub is called the Ver macaque  (Fig. 79); in Para, Ura; in Costa Rica, Torcel; and in New Granada,  Gusano peludo, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],[0,"The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#14)"],[1,"dder.  Those big, webbed hind feet are the paddles which drive him through  the water.  He can stay under water a long time--as much as five  minutes.  See, he has just come up now.\"    Sure enough, Paddy's head had just appeared clear across the pond  almost to the opposite shore, and he was now swimming on the surface.  Old Mother Nature at once led the way around the pond to a small  grove of poplar trees which stood a little way back from the water.  Paddy was already there.  \"Now,\" said Old Mother Nature \"show us what  kind of a lumberman you are.\"    Paddy picked out a small tree, sat up much as Happy Jack Squirrel  does, but with his big flat tail on the ground to brace him,  seized the trunk of the tree in both hands, and went to work with  his great orange-colored cutting teeth.  He bit out a big chip.  Then another and another.  Gradually he worked around the tree.  After a while the tree began to sway and crack.  Paddy bit out two  or three more chips, then suddenly slapped the ground with his  tail as a warning and scampered back to a safe distance.  He was  taking no chances of being caught under that falling tree.    The tree fell, and at once Paddy returned to work.  The smaller  branches he cut off with a single bite at the base of each.  The larger ones required a number of bites.  Then he set to work  to cut the trunk up in short logs.  At this point Old Mother  Nature interrupted.    \"Now show us,\" said she, \"what you do with the logs.\"    Paddy at once got behind a log, and by pushing, rolled it ahead  of him until at last it fell with a splash in the water of a ditch  or canal which led from near that grove of trees to the pond.  Paddy followed into the water and began to push it ahead of him  towards the pond.    \"That will do,\" spoke up Old Mother Nature. \"Come out and show us  how you take the branches.\"    Obediently Paddy climbed out and returned to the fallen tree.  There  he picked up one of the long branches in his mouth, grasping it near  the butt, twisted it over his shoulder and started to drag it to  the canal.  When he reached the latter he entered the water and began  swimming, still dragging the branch in the same way.  Once more Old  Mother Nature stopped him.  \"You've shown us how you cut trees and  move them, so now I want you to answer a few questions,\" said she.    Paddy climbed out and squatted on the bank.    \"How did this canal happen to be here handy?\" asked Old Mother Nature.    \"Why, I dug it, of course,\" replied Paddy looking surprised.  \"You  see, I'm rather slow and clumsy on land, and don't like to be far  from water.  Those trees are pretty well back from the pond, so I  dug this canal, which brings the water almost to them.  It makes  it safer for me in case Old Man Coyote or Buster Bear or Yowler the  Bobcat happens to be looking for a Beaver dinner.  Also it makes  it very much easier to get my logs and branches to the pond.\"    Old Mother Nature nodded.  \"Just so,\" said she.  \"I want the rest  of you to notice how well this canal has been dug.  At the other  end it is carried along the bottom of the pond where the water is  shallow so as to give greater depth.  Now you will understand why  I called Paddy an engineer.  What do you do with your logs and  branches, Paddy?\"    \"Put them in my food-pile, out there where the water is deep near  my house,\" replied Paddy promptly.  \"The bark I eat, and the bare  sticks I use to keep my house and dam in repair.  In the late fall  I cut enough trees to keep me in food all winter.  When my pond is  covered with ice I have nothing to worry about; my food supply  is below the ice.  When I am hungry I swim out under the ice, get  a stick, take it back into my house and eat the bark.  Then I take  the bare stick outside to use when needed on my dam or house.\"    \"How did you come to make this fine pond?\" asked Old Mother Nature.    \"Oh, I just happened to come exploring up the Laughing Brook and  found there was plenty of food here and a good place for a pond,\"  replied Paddy.  \"I thought I would like to live here.  Down where  my dam is, the Laughing Brook was shallow--just the place for  a dam.\"    \"Tell us why you wanted a pond and how you built that dam,\"  commanded Old Mother Nature.    \"Why, I had to have a pond, if I was to stay here,\" replied Paddy,  as if every one must understand that.  \"The Laughing Brook wasn't  deep or big enough for me to live here safely.  If it had been, I  would have made my home in the bank and not bothered with a house  or dam.  But it wasn't, so I had to make a pond.  It required a  lot of hard work, but it is worth all it cost.    \"First, I cut a lot of brush and young trees and placed them in  the Laughing Brook in that shallow place, with the butts pointing  up-stream.  I kept them in place by piling mud and stones on them.  Then I kept piling on more sticks and brush and mud.  The water  brought down leaves and floating stuff, and this caught in the  dam and helped fill it in.  I dug a lot of mud in front of it and  used this to fill in the spaces between the sticks.  This made the  water deeper in front of the dam and at the same time kept it from  getting through.  As the water backed up, of course it made a pond.  I kept making my dam longer and higher, and the longer and higher  it became the bigger the pond grew.  When it was big enough and  deep enough to suit me, I stopped work on the dam and built my  house out there.\"    Everybody turned to look at Paddy's house, the roof of which stood  high out of water a little way from the dam.  \"Tell us how you  built that,\" said Old Mother Nature quietly.    \"Oh, I just made a big platform of sticks and mud out there where  it was deep enough for me to be sure that the water could not  freeze clear to the bottom, even in the coldest weather,\" replied  Paddy, in a matter-of-fact tone.  \"I built it up until it was  above water.  Then I built the walls and roof of sticks and mud,  just as you see them there.  Inside I have a fine big room with a  comfortable bed of shredded wood.  I have two openings in the  floor with a long passage leading from each down through the  foundations and opening at the bottom of the pond.  Of course,  these are filled with water.  Some houses have only one passage,  but I like two.  These are the only entrances to my house.    \"Every fall I repair my walls and roof, adding sticks and mud and  turf, so that now they are very thick.  Late in the fall I  sometimes plaster the outside with mud.  This freezes hard, and  no enemy who may reach my house on the ice can tear it open.  I  guess that's all.\"    Peter Rabbit drew a long breath.  \"What dreadful lot of work,\" said  he.  \"Do you work all the time?\"    Paddy chuckled.  \"No, Peter,\" said he.  And Old Mother Nature nodded  in approval.  \"Quite right,\" said she.  \"Quite right.  Are there  any more questions?\"    \"Do you eat nothing but bark?\"  It was Happy Jack Squirrel who spoke.    \"Oh, no,\" replied Paddy.  \"In summer I eat berries, mushrooms, grass  and the leaves and stems of a number of plants.  In winter I vary my  fare with lily roots and the roots of alder and willow.  But bark is  my principal food.\"    Old Mother Nature waited a few minutes, but as there were no more  questions she added a few words.  \"Now I hope you understand why I  am so proud of Paddy the Beaver, and why I told you that he is a  lumberman, builder and engineer,\" said she.  \"For the next lesson  we will take up the Rat family.\"        CHAPTER XIII  A Worker and a Robber    \"Now we come to the largest family of the Rodent order, the Rat  family, which of course includes the Mice,\" said Old Mother Nature,  after calling school to order at the old meeting-place.  \"And the  largest member of the family reminds me very much of the one we  learned about yesterday.\"    \"I know!\" cried Peter Rabbit.  \"You mean Jerry Muskrat.\"    \"Go to the head of the class, Peter,\" said Old Mother Nature,  smiling.  \"Jerry is the very one, the largest member of the Rat  family.  Sometimes he is spoken of as a little cousin of Paddy the  Beaver.  Probably this is because he looks something like a small  Beaver, builds a house in the water as Paddy does, and lives in  very much the same way.  The truth is, he is no more closely related  to Paddy than he is to the rest of you.  He is a true Rat.  He is  called Muskrat because he carries with him a scent called musk.  It  is not an unpleasant scent, like that of Jimmy Skunk, and isn't used  for the same purpose.  Jerry uses his to tell his friends where he  has been.  He leaves a little of it at the places he visits.  Some  folks call him Musquash, but Muskrat is better.    \"Jerry is seldom found far from the water and then only when he is  seeking a new home.  He is rather slow and awkward on land; but in  the water he is quite at home, as all of you know who have visited  the Smiling Pool.  He can dive and swim under water a long distance,  though not as far as Paddy the Beaver.\"    \"Has he webbed hind feet like Paddy?\" piped up Jumper the Hare.    \"Yes and no,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"They are not fully webbed  as Paddy's are, but there is a little webbing between some of the  toes, enough to be of great help in swimming.  His tail is of greater  use in swimming than is Paddy's.  It is bare and scaly, but instead  of being flat top and bottom it is flattened on the sides, and he  uses it as a propeller, moving it rapidly from side to side.    \"Like Paddy he has a dark brown outer coat, lighter underneath than  on his back and sides, and like Paddy he has a very warm soft under  coat, through which the water cannot get and which keeps him  comfortable, no matter how cold the water is.  You have all seen  his house in the Smiling Pool.  He builds it in much the same way  that Paddy builds his, but instead of sticks he cuts and uses  rushes.  Of course it is not nearly as large as Paddy's house,  because Jerry is himself so much smaller.  It is"]]]
