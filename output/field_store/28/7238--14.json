It is to this  inability to understand the facts of the South African situation, as  he had learnt them, that we must attribute the comparative feebleness  shown by the Unionist leaders in resisting the perverse attempt which  was made by the Liberal party, after the General Election of 1906, to  revoke the final arrangements of his administration. The interval that  separated Lord Milner's knowledge of South Africa from that of the  Liberal ministers was profound; but even the Unionist chiefs showed  but slight appreciation of the unassailable validity of the  administrative decisions with which they had identified themselves,  when the \"swing of the pendulum\" brought these decisions again, and  somewhat unexpectedly, before the great tribunal of the nation.    [Sidenote: Arrival at Cape Town.]    Lord Milner sailed for the Cape on April 17th, 1897. At the actual  moment of his arrival the relations between the Home Government and  the South African Republic were strained almost to the breaking point.  In a peremptory despatch of March 6th, Mr. Chamberlain had demanded  the repeal of the Aliens Immigration and Aliens Expulsion Laws of  1896--the former of which constituted a flagrant violation of the  freedom of entry secured to British subjects by Article XIV. of the  London Convention. This virtual ultimatum was emphasised by the  appearance of a British squadron at Delagoa Bay, and by the despatch  of reinforcements to the South African garrisons. The evident  determination of the Imperial Government induced the Volksraad to  repeal the Immigration Law and to pass a resolution in favour of  amending the Expulsion Law. The crisis was over in June, and during  the next few months the Pretoria Executive showed a somewhat more  conciliatory temper towards the Government of Great Britain. And in  this connection two other facts must be recorded. In August, 1896, Sir  Jacobus de Wet had been succeeded as British Agent at Pretoria by Sir  William (then Mr.) Conyngham Greene, and the Imperial Government was  assured, by this appointment, of the services of an able man and a  trained diplomatist. The Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into the  Raid, promised in July, 1896, met on February 16th, 1897, and reported  on July 13th of the same year. Its report did little more than  reassert the findings of the Cape Parliamentary Inquiry, which had  been before the British public for the last year. It was otherwise  remarkable for the handle which it gave (by the failure to insist upon  the production of certain telegrams) to some extreme Radicals to  assert Mr. Chamberlain's \"complicity\" in the \"invasion\" of the  Transvaal as originally planned by Mr. Rhodes.    [Sidenote: Milner's thoroughness.]    Lord Milner had expressed his intention of acquainting himself with  the conditions of South Africa by personal observation before he  attempted to take any definite action for the solution of the  problems awaiting his attention. Nor, after the first month of  anxious diplomatic controversy with the Pretoria Executive, was there  anything either in the political situation in the Cape Colony, or in  the attitude of the Transvaal Government, to prevent him from putting  his purpose into effect. Apart from the circumstance that the  reorganisation of the Chartered Company's Administration--a question  in which the political future of Mr. Rhodes was largely involved--was  a matter upon which his observation and advice were urgently required  by the Colonial Office, Lord Milner had no intention, as he said, of  \"being tied to an office chair at Capetown.\" He had resolved,  therefore, to visit at the earliest opportunity, first, the country  districts of the colony which formed the actual seat of the Dutch  population, and, second, the two protectorates of Bechuanaland and  Basutoland, which were administered by officers directly responsible  to the High Commissioner, as the representative of the Imperial  Government. In point of fact he did more than this. Within a year of  his arrival he had travelled through the Cape Colony (August and  September, 1897), through the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Rhodesia  (November and December, 1897), and visited Basutoland (April, 1898).  And with characteristic thoroughness he set himself to learn both the  Dutch of Holland and the \"Taal\"--the former in order that he might  read the newspapers which the Afrikanders read, and the latter to  open the way to that intercourse of eye and ear which most helps a  man to know the character of his neighbour.    Lord Milner's year of observation may be said to have ended with the  speech at Graaf Reinet (March 3rd, 1898), which held his first clear  and emphatic public utterance. During the greater part of this period  he was by no means exclusively occupied with the shortcomings of  President Krueger. The discharge of his official duties as Governor of  the Cape Colony required more than ordinary care and watchfulness in  view of the disturbed state of South African politics. And as High  Commissioner he was called upon to deal with a number of questions  relative to the affairs of Rhodesia and the Protectorates, of which  some led him into the new and unfamiliar field of native law and  custom, while others involved the exercise of his judgment on delicate  matters of personal fitness and official etiquette. But an account of  these questions--questions which he handled with equal insight and  decision--must yield to the commanding interest of the actual steps by  which he approached the two central problems upon the solution of  which the maintenance of British supremacy in South Africa  depended--the removal of the pernicious system of race oligarchy in  the Transvaal, and the preservation of the Cape Colony in its  allegiance to the British Crown.    [Sidenote: His friendliness to the Boers.]    The position which Lord Milner took up in his relations with the  Transvaal Government was one that was consistent alike with his  personal characteristics and with the dictates of a high and  enlightened statesmanship. Within the first few weeks of his arrival  he let it be known, both through the British Agent at Pretoria, and  through those of the Afrikander leaders in the Cape Colony who were on  terms of intimacy with President Krueger, that he desired, as it were,  to open an entirely new account between the two governments. He, a new  High Commissioner with no South African past, with no errors to  retrieve, no failures to rankle, could afford to bury the diplomatic  hatchet. There was nothing to prevent him from approaching the  discussion of any questions that might arise in a spirit of perfect  friendliness, or from believing that the President would be inspired,  on his side, by the same friendly feelings. It was his hope,  therefore, that much of the friction incidental to formal diplomatic  controversy might be avoided through the settlement of all lesser  matters by amicable and informal discussion between President Krueger  and himself.    This was no mere official pose. Milner never posed. He, too, desired  to eliminate the Imperial factor in his own way. He saw from the first  the advantage of limiting the area of dispute between Downing Street  and Pretoria; and he made it his object to settle as many matters as  possible by friendly discussion on the spot. The desire to avoid  unnecessary diplomatic friction, and to make the best of President  Krueger, was manifested in all he did at this time. In the course of  the preparations for the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee by the  British community on the Rand, the new High Commissioner was asked to  decide whether the toast of Queen Victoria, or that of President  Krueger, should come first upon the list at the public banquet. He  replied unhesitatingly that the courtesy due to President Krueger, as  the head of the State, must be fully accorded. On this occasion, of  all others, British subjects, he said, \"should be most careful to  avoid anything which might be regarded as a slight to the South  African Republic or its chief magistrate.\"[27]             [Footnote 27: The incident is otherwise interesting as           affording the first sign of that confidence of the British           population in Lord Milner, which, steadily increasing as the           final and inevitable struggle approached, earned for him at           length the unfaltering support of British South Africa. After           the Rand celebrations were over, he was informed that his           advice had been put into effect with \"very considerable           difficulty.\" The argument which had prevailed was this: \"The           new High Commissioner is a tested man of affairs; we all look           to him to put British interests on a solid basis; and as we           do this, let us obey him in a matter like this.\"]    [Sidenote: Milner and the Conventions.]    While to President Krueger Lord Milner said, \"Let us see if we cannot  arrange matters by friendly discussion between ourselves\"; to the  Colonial Office he said, \"Give them time; don't hurry them. Reform  there must be: if by no other means, then by our intervention. But  before we intervene, let us be sure that they either cannot, or will  not, reform themselves. Therefore let us wait patiently, and make  things as easy as possible for President Krueger.\" More than this, he  had almost as little belief in the utility of the Conventions[28] as  Grey had in those of his epoch. Whether the Boers did, or did not,  call the Queen \"Suzerain\" seemed to him to be a small matter--an  etymological question, as he afterwards called it. What was essential  was that men of British blood should not be kept under the heel of the  Dutch. Moreover, the grievances for which the observance of the London  Convention, however strictly enforced,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#14)"],[1,"eyes;  enemy to beggars; attacks strangers without provocation; hates strange  dogs; howls at certain notes in music, and often urines on hearing  them; will snap at a stone thrown at it; is sick at the approach of  bad weather, (a remark vague and uncertain); is afflicted with worms;  spreads its madness; grows blind with age; _saepe gonorrhaea infectus_;  driven as unclean from the houses of the Mahometans; yet the same  people establish hospitals for, and allow them daily food.    The dog, says Buffon, like every other animal which produces above one  or two at a time, is not perfectly formed immediately after birth.  Dogs are always brought forth blind; the two eyelids are not simply  glued together, but shut up with a membrane, which is torn off, as  soon as the muscles of the upper eyelids acquire strength sufficient  to overcome this obstacle to vision, which generally happens the tenth  or twelfth day. At this period, the bones of the head are not  completed, the body and muzzle are bloated, and the whole figure is  ill defined; but in less than two months, they learn to use all their  senses; their growth is rapid, and they soon gain strength. In the  fourth month, they lose some of their teeth, which, as in other  animals, are soon replaced, and never again fall out: they have six  cutting and two canine teeth in each jaw, and fourteen grinders in the  upper, and twelve in the under, making in all forty-two teeth; but the  number of grinders sometimes varies in particular dogs.    The time of gestation is nine weeks, or sixty-three days; sometimes  sixty-two or sixty-one, but never less than sixty.    The bitch produces six, seven, and even so far as twelve puppies, and  generally has more at the subsequent litters than she has at the  first; but the observation of Buffon, that a female hound, covered by  a dog of her own kind, and carefully shut up from all others, has been  known to produce a mixed race, consisting of hounds and terriers, is  totally void of foundation. A curious circumstance, in the account of  the setter, will be mentioned, of an impression made upon the mind of  a bitch of that sort by the attention of a cur, which never had access  to her, and yet her whelps were always like him, and possibly this  hound bitch had a violent hankering after some terrier.    Dogs continue to propagate during life, which is commonly limited to  fourteen or fifteen years, yet some have been known to exceed twenty,  but that is rare. The duration of life in this, as in other animals,  bears proportion to the time of his growth, which in the dog is not  completed in less than two years, and he generally lives fourteen. His  age may be discovered by his teeth; when young, they are white, sharp,  and pointed; as he increases in years, they become black, blunt, and  unequal: it may likewise be known by the hair, which turns grey on the  muzzle, front, and round the eyes.    The manner in which the shepherds of the Pyrenees employ their  peculiar breed of dogs, which are large, long-haired, of a tawny white  colour, and a very strong build, with a ferocious temper, exhibits a  vivid instance of the trust they repose in the courage and fidelity of  these animals, and of the virtues by which they merit and reward it.  Attended by three or more dogs, the shepherds will take their numerous  flocks at early dawn to the part of the mountain side which is  destined for their pasture. Having counted them, they descend to  follow other occupations, and commit the guardianship of the sheep to  the sole watchfulness of the dogs. It has been frequently known, that  when wolves have approached, the three sentinels would walk round and  round the flock, gradually compressing them into so small a circle  that one dog might with ease overlook and protect them, and that this  measure of caution being executed, the remaining two would set forth  to engage the enemy, over whom, it is said, they invariably triumph.    The following interesting remarks are extracted from Chambers:--    The educability of the dog's perceptive faculties has been exemplified  in a remarkable manner by his acquired knowledge of musical sounds. On  some dogs fine music produces an apparently painful effect, causing  them gradually to become restless, to moan piteously, and, finally, to  fly from the spot with every sign of suffering and distress. Others  have been seen to sit and listen to music with seeming delight, and  even to go every Sunday to church, with the obvious purpose of  enjoying the solemn and powerful strains of the organ. Some dogs  manifest a keen sense of false notes in music. Mrs. Samuel Carter  Hall, at Old Brompton, possesses an Italian greyhound, which screams  in apparent agony when a jarring combination of notes is produced,  accidentally or intentionally, on the piano. These opposite and  various manifestations show what might be done by education to teach  dogs a critical knowledge of sounds. A gentleman of Darmstadt, in  Germany, as we learn, has taught a poodle dog to detect false notes in  music. We give the account of this remarkable instance of educability  as it appears in a French newspaper.    Mr. S----, having acquired a competency by commercial industry,  retired from business, and devoted himself, heart and soul, to the  cultivation and enjoyment of music. Every member of his little  household was by degrees involved more or less in the same occupation,  and even the housemaid could in time bear a part in a chorus, or  decipher a melody of Schubert. One individual alone in the family  seemed to resist this musical entrancement; this was a small spaniel,  the sole specimen of the canine race in the mansion. Mr. S---- felt  the impossibility of instilling the theory of sounds into the head of  Poodle, but he firmly resolved to make the animal bear _some_ part or  other in the general domestic concert; and by perseverance, and the  adoption of ingenious means, he attained his object. Every time that a  _false note_ escaped either from the instrument or voice--as often as  any blunder, of whatever kind, was committed by the members of the  musical family (and such blunders were sometimes committed  intentionally)--down came its master's cane on the back of the  unfortunate poodle, till she howled and growled again. Poodle  perceived the meaning of these unkind chastisements, and instead of  becoming sulky, showed every disposition to howl on the instant a  false note was uttered, without waiting for the formality of a blow.  By and by, a mere glance of Mr. S----'s eye was sufficient to make the  animal howl to admiration. In the end, Poodle became so thoroughly  acquainted with, and attentive to, false notes and other musical  barbarisms, that the slightest mistake of the kind was infallibly  signalised by a yell from her, forming the most expressive commentary  upon the misperformance.    When extended trials were made of the animal's acquirements, they were  never found to fail, and Poodle became, what she still is, the most  famous, impartial, and conscientious connoisseur in the Duchy of  Hesse. But, as may be imagined, her musical appreciation is entirely  negative; if you sing with expression, and play with ability, she will  remain cold and impassible. But let your execution exhibit the  slightest defect, and you will have her instantly showing her teeth,  whisking her tail, yelping, barking, and growling. At the present  time, there is not a concert or an opera at Darmstadt to which Mr.  S---- and his wonderful dog are not invited; or, at least, _the dog_.  The voice of the prima donna, the instruments of the band--whether  violin, clarionet, hautbois, or bugle--all of them must execute their  parts in perfect harmony, otherwise Poodle looks at its master, erects  its ears, shows its grinders, and howls outright. Old or new pieces,  known or unknown to the dog, produce on it the same effect.    It must not be supposed that the discrimination of the creature is  confined to the mere _execution_ of musical compositions. Whatever may  have been the case at the outset of its training, its present and  perfected intelligence extends even to the secrets of composition.  Thus, if a vicious modulation, or a false relation of parts, occur in  a piece of music, the animal shows symptoms of uneasy hesitation; and  if the error be continued, will infallibly give the grand condemnatory  howl. In short, Poodle is the terror of all the middling composers of  Darmstadt, and a perfect nightmare to the imagination of all poor  singers and players. Sometimes Mr. S---- and his friends take a  pleasure in annoying the canine critic, by emitting all sorts of  discordant sounds from instrument and voice. On such occasions the  creature loses all self-command, its eyes shoot forth fiery flashes,  and long and frightful howls respond to the immelodious concert of the  mischievous bipeds. But the latter must be careful not to go too far;  for when the dog's patience is tried to excess, it becomes altogether  wild, and flies fiercely at the tormentors and their instruments.    This dog's case is a very curious one, and the attendant phenomena not  very easy of explanation. From the animal's power of discerning the  correctness of musical composition, as well as of execution, one would  be inclined to imagine that Mr. S----, in training his dog, had only  called into play faculties existing (but latent) before, and that dogs  have in them the natural germs of a fine musical ear. This seems more  likely to be the case, than that the animal's perfect musical taste  was wholly an acquirement, resulting from the training. However this  may be, the Darmstadt dog is certainly a marvellous creature, and we  are surprised that, in these exhibiting times, its powers have not  been displayed on a wider stage. The operatic establishments of London  and Paris might be greatly the better, perhaps, for a visit from the  critical Poodle.    It "]]]
