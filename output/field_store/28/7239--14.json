The coincidence itself on  which this perverse reasoning rests is a singular one--singular, that  is, as showing how close an accidental coincidence may run. It amounts  to this, that if the number of days in the year be multiplied by 100,  and a circle be drawn with a circumference containing 100 times as many  inches as there are days in the year, the radius of the circle will be  very nearly one 1,000,000,000th part of the sun's distance. Remembering  that the pyramid inch is assumed to be one 500,000,000th part of the  earth's diameter, we shall not be far from the truth in saying that, as  a matter of fact, the earth by her orbital motion traverses each day a  distance equal to two hundred times her own diameter. But, of course,  this relation is altogether accidental. It has no real cause in  nature.[23]    Such relations show that mere numerical coincidences, however close,  have little weight as evidence, except where they occur in series. Even  then they require to be very cautiously regarded, seeing that the  history of science records many instances where the apparent law of a  series has been found to be falsified when the theory has been extended.  Of course this reason is not quoted in order to throw doubt on the  supposition that the height of the pyramid was intended to symbolise the  sun's distance. That supposition is simply inadmissible if the  hypothesis, according to which the height was already independently  determined in another way, is admitted. Either hypothesis might be  admitted were we not certain that the sun's distance could not possibly  have been known to the builders of the pyramid; or both hypotheses may  be rejected: but to admit both is out of the question.    Considering the multitude of dimensions of length, surface, capacity,  and position, the great number of shapes, and the variety of material  existing within the pyramid, and considering, further, the enormous  number of relations (presented by modern science) from among which to  choose, can it be wondered at if fresh coincidences are being  continually recognised? If a dimension will not serve in one way, use  can be found for it in another; for instance, if some measure of length  does not correspond closely with any known dimension of the earth or of  the solar system (an unlikely supposition), then it can be understood to  typify an interval of time. If, even after trying all possible changes  of that kind, no coincidence shows itself (which is all but impossible),  then all that is needed to secure a coincidence is that the dimensions  should be manipulated a little.    Let a single instance suffice to show how the pyramidalists (with  perfect honesty of purpose) hunt down a coincidence. The slant tunnel  already described has a transverse height, once no doubt uniform, now  giving various measures from 47.14 pyramid inches to 47.32 inches, so  that the vertical height from the known inclination of the tunnel would  be estimated at somewhere between 52.64 inches and 52.85. Neither  dimension corresponds very obviously with any measured distance in the  earth or solar system. Nor when we try periods, areas, etc., does any  very satisfactory coincidence present itself. But the difficulty is  easily turned into a new proof of design. Putting all the observations  together (says Professor Smyth), 'I deduced 47.24 pyramid inches to be  the transverse height of the entrance passage; and computing from thence  with the observed angle of inclination the vertical height, that came  out 52.76 of the same inches. But the sum of those two heights, or the  height taken up and down, equals 100 inches, which length, as elsewhere  shown, is the general pyramid linear representation of a day of  twenty-four hours. And the mean of the two heights, or the height taken  one way only, and impartially to the middle point between them, equals  fifty inches; which quantity is, therefore, the general pyramid linear  representation of only half a day. In which case, let us ask what the  entrance passage has to do with half rather than a whole day?'    On relations such as these, which, if really intended by the architect,  would imply an utterly fatuous habit of concealing elaborately what he  desired to symbolise, the pyramidalists base their belief that 'a Mighty  Intelligence did both think out the plans for it, and compel unwilling  and ignorant idolators, in a primal age of the world, to work mightily  both for the future glory of the one true God of Revelation, and to  establish lasting prophetic testimony touching a further development,  still to take place, of the absolutely Divine Christian dispensation.'          III.    _THE MYSTERY OF THE PYRAMIDS._      Few subjects of inquiry have proved more perplexing than the question of  the purpose for which the pyramids of Egypt were built. Even in the  remotest ages of which we have historical record, nothing seems to have  been known certainly on this point. For some reason or other, the  builders of the pyramids concealed the object of these structures, and  this so successfully that not even a tradition has reached us which  purports to have been handed down from the epoch of the pyramids'  construction. We find, indeed, some explanations given by the earliest  historians; but they were professedly only hypothetical, like those  advanced in more recent times. Including ancient and modern theories, we  find a wide range of choice. Some have thought that these buildings were  associated with the religion of the early Egyptians; others have  suggested that they were tombs; others, that they combined the purposes  of tombs and temples, that they were astronomical observatories,  defences against the sands of the Great Desert, granaries like those  made under Joseph's direction, places of resort during excessive  overflows of the Nile; and many other uses have been suggested for them.  But none of these ideas are found on close examination to be tenable as  representing the sole purpose of the pyramids, and few of them have  strong claims to be regarded as presenting even a chief object of these  remarkable structures. The significant and perplexing history of the  three oldest pyramids--the Great Pyramid of Cheops, Shofo, or Suphis,  the pyramid of Chephren, and the pyramid of Mycerinus; and the most  remarkable of all the facts known respecting the pyramids generally,  viz., the circumstance that one pyramid after another was built as  though each had become useless soon after it was finished, are left  entirely unexplained by all the theories above mentioned, save one only,  the tomb theory, and that does not afford by any means a satisfactory  explanation of the circumstances.    I propose to give here a brief account of some of the most suggestive  facts known respecting the pyramids, and, after considering the  difficulties which beset the theories heretofore advanced, to indicate a  theory (new so far as I know) which seems to me to correspond better  with the facts than any heretofore advanced; I suggest it, however,  rather for consideration than because I regard it as very convincingly  supported by the evidence. In fact, to advance any theory at present  with confident assurance of its correctness, would be simply to indicate  a very limited acquaintance with the difficulties surrounding the  subject.    Let us first consider a few of the more striking facts recorded by  history or tradition, noting, as we proceed, whatever ideas they may  suggest as to the intended character of these structures.    It is hardly necessary to say, perhaps, that the history of the Great  Pyramid is of paramount importance in this inquiry. Whatever purpose  pyramids were originally intended to subserve, must have been conceived  by the builders of _that_ pyramid. New ideas may have been superadded by  the builders of later pyramids, but it is unlikely that the original  purpose can have been entirely abandoned. Some great purpose there was,  which the rulers of ancient Egypt proposed to fulfil by building very  massive pyramidal structures on a particular plan. It is by inquiring  into the history of the first and most massive of these structures, and  by examining its construction, that we shall have the best chance of  finding out what that great purpose was.    According to Herodotus, the kings who built the pyramids reigned not  more than twenty-eight centuries ago; but there can be little doubt that  Herodotus misunderstood the Egyptian priests from whom he derived his  information, and that the real antiquity of the pyramid-kings was far  greater. He tells us that, according to the Egyptian priests, Cheops 'on  ascending the throne plunged into all manner of wickedness. He closed  the temples, and forbade the Egyptians to offer sacrifice, compelling  them instead to labour one and all in his service, viz., in building the  Great Pyramid.' Still following his interpretation of the Egyptian  account, we learn that one hundred thousand men were employed for twenty  years in building the Great Pyramid, and that ten years were occupied in  constructing a causeway by which to convey the stones to the place and  in conveying them there. 'Cheops reigned fifty years; and was succeeded  by his brother Chephren, who imitated the conduct of his predecessor,  built a pyramid--but smaller than his brother's--and reigned fifty-six  years. Thus during one hundred and six years, the temples were shut and  never opened.' Moreover, Herodotus tells us that 'the Egyptians so  detested the memory of these kings, that they do not much like even to  mention their names. Hence they commonly call the pyramids after  Philition, a shepherd"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26598"],[0,"Seasoning of Wood (#14)"],[1,"is often dyed black and sold as ebony; works well and  stands well. Most abundant in the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf  States, but occurring eastward to Massachusetts and north to Indiana.    =48. Holly= (_Ilex monticolo_) (Mountain Holly). Small-sized tree. Wood  in its quality and uses similar to the preceding, but is not very  generally known. It is found in the Catskill Mountains and extends  southward along the Alleghanies as far as Alabama.                           HORSE CHESTNUT (See Buckeye)                                     IRONWOOD    =49. Ironwood= (_Ostrya Virginiana_) (Hop Hornbeam, Lever Wood).  Small-sized tree, common. Heartwood light brown tinged with red,  sapwood nearly white. Wood heavy, tough, exceedingly close-grained,  very strong and hard, durable in contact with the soil, and will take  a fine polish.

Laurel= (_Umbellularia Californica_) (Myrtle). A Western tree,  produces timber of light brown color of great size and beauty, and is  very valuable for cabinet and inside work, as it takes a fine polish.  California and Oregon, coast range of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.                                      LOCUST    =51. Black Locust= (_Robinia pseudacacia_) (Locust, Yellow Locust,  Acacia). Small to medium-sized tree. Wood very heavy, hard, strong,  and tough, rivalling some of the best oak in this latter quality. The  wood has great torsional strength, excelling most of the soft woods in  this respect, of coarse texture, close-grained and compact structure,  takes a fine polish. Annual rings clearly marked, very durable in  contact with the soil, shrinks and checks considerably in drying, the  very narrow sapwood greenish yellow, the heartwood brown, with shades  of red and green. Used for wagon hubs, trenails or pins, but  especially for railway ties, fence posts, and door sills. Also used  for boat parts, turnery, ornamentations, and locally for construction.  Abroad it is much used for furniture and farming implements and also  in turnery. At home in the Alleghany Mountains, extensively planted,  especially in the West.    =52. Honey Locust= (_Gleditschia triacanthos_) (Honey Shucks, Locust,  Black Locust, Brown Locust, Sweet Locust, False Acacia, Three-Thorned  Acacia). A medium-sized tree. Wood heavy, hard, strong, tough, durable  in contact with the soil, of coarse texture, susceptible to a good  polish. The narrow sapwood yellow, the heartwood brownish red. So far,  but little appreciated except for fences and fuel. Used to some extent  for wheel hubs, and locally in rough construction. Found from  Pennsylvania to Nebraska, and southward to Florida and Texas; locally  quite abundant.    =53. Locust= (_Robinia viscosa_) (Clammy Locust). Usually a shrub five  or six feet high, but known to reach a height of 40 feet in the  mountains of North Carolina, with the habit of a tree. Wood light  brown, heavy, hard, and close-grained. Not used to much extent in  manufacture. Range same as the preceding.                                     MAGNOLIA    =54. Magnolia= (_Magnolia glauca_) (Swamp Magnolia, Small Magnolia,  Sweet Bay, Beaver Wood). Small-sized tree. Heartwood reddish brown,  sap wood cream white. Sparingly used in manufacture. Ranges from Essex  County, Mass., to Long Island, N. Y., from New Jersey to Florida, and  west in the Gulf region to Texas.    =55. Magnolia= (_Magnolia tripetala_) (Umbrella Tree). A small-sized  tree. Wood in its quality similiar to the preceding. It may be easily  recognized by its great leaves, twelve to eighteen inches long, and  five to eight inches broad. This species as well as the preceding is  an ornamental tree. Ranges from Pennsylvania southward to the Gulf.    =56. Cucumber Tree= (_Magnolia accuminata_) (Tulip-wood, Poplar).  Medium- to large-sized tree. Heartwood yellowish brown, sapwood almost  white. Wood light, soft, satiny, close-grained, durable in contact  with the soil, resembling and sometimes confounded with tulip tree  (_Liriodendron tulipifera_) in the markets. The wood shrinks  considerably, but seasons without much injury, and works and stands  well. It bends readily when steamed, and takes stain and paint well.  Used in cooperage, for siding, for panelling and finishing lumber in  house, car and shipbuilding, etc., also in the manufacture of toys,  culinary woodenware, and backing for drawers. Most common in the  southern Alleghanies, but distributed from western New York to  southern Illinois, south through central Kentucky and Tennessee to  Alabama, and throughout Arkansas.                                       MAPLE    Wood heavy, hard, strong, stiff, and tough, of fine texture,  frequently wavy-grained, this giving rise to \"curly\" and \"blister\"  figures which are much admired. Not durable in the ground, or when  exposed. Maple is creamy white, with shades of light brown in the  heartwood, shrinks moderately, seasons, works, and stands well, wears  smoothly, and takes a fine polish. The wood is used in cooperage, and  for ceiling, flooring, panelling, stairway, and other finishing lumber  in house, ship, and car construction. It is used for the keels of  boats and ships, in the manufacture of implements and machinery, but  especially for furniture, where entire chamber sets of maple rival  those of oak. Maple is also used for shoe lasts and other form blocks;  for shoe pegs; for piano actions, school apparatus, for wood type in  show bill printing, tool handles, in wood carving, turnery, and scroll  work, in fact it is one of our most useful woods. The maples are  medium-sized trees, of fairly rapid growth, sometimes form forests,  and frequently constitute a large proportion of the arborescent  growth. They grow freely in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, and are  particularly luxuriant in Canada and the northern portions of the  United States.    =57. Sugar Maple= (_Acer saccharum_) (Hard Maple, Rock Maple). Medium-  to large-sized tree, very common, forms considerable forests, and is  especially esteemed. The wood is close-grained, heavy, fairly hard and  strong, of compact structure. Heartwood brownish, sapwood lighter  color; it can be worked to a satin-like surface and take a fine  polish, it is not durable if exposed, and requires a good deal of  seasoning. Medullary rays small but distinct. The \"curly\" or \"wavy\"  varieties furnish wood of much beauty, the peculiar contortions of the  grain called \"bird's eye\" being much sought after, and used as veneer  for panelling, etc. It is used in all good grades of furniture,  cabinetmaking, panelling, interior finish, and turnery; it is not  liable to warp and twist. It is also largely used for flooring, for  rollers for wringers and mangling machines, for which there is a large  and increasing demand. The peculiarity known as \"bird's eye,\" and  which causes a difficulty in working the wood smooth, owing to the  little pieces like knots lifting up, is supposed to be due to the  action of boring insects. Its resistance to compression across the  grain is higher than that of most other woods. Ranges from Maine to  Minnesota, abundant, with birch, in the region of the Great Lakes.    =58. Red Maple= (_Acer rubrum_) (Swamp Maple, Soft Maple, Water Maple).  Medium-sized tree. Like the preceding but not so valuable. Scattered  along water-courses and other moist localities. Abundant. Maine to  Minnesota, southward to northern Florida.    =59. Silver Maple= (_Acer saccharinum_) (Soft Maple, White Maple,  Silver-Leaved Maple). Medium- to large-sized tree, common. Wood  lighter, softer, and inferior to _Acer saccharum_, and usually offered  in small quantities and held separate in the markets. Heartwood  reddish brown, sapwood ivory white, fine-grained, compact structure.  Fibres sometimes twisted, weaved, or curly. Not durable. Used in  cooperage for woodenware, turnery articles, interior decorations and  flooring. Valley of the Ohio, but occurs from Maine to Dakota and  southward to Florida.    =60. Broad-Leaved Maple= (_Acer macrophyllum_) (Oregon Maple).  Medium-sized tree, forms considerable forests, and, like the preceding  has a lighter, softer, and less valuable wood than _Acer saccharum_.  Pacific Coast regions.    =61. Mountain Maple= (_Acer spicatum_). Small-sized tree. Heartwood pale  reddish brown, sapwood lighter color. Wood light, soft, close-grained,  and susceptible of high polish. Ranges from lower St. Lawrence River  to northern Minnesota and regions of the Saskatchewan River; south  through the Northern States and along the Appalachian Mountains to  Georgia.    =62. Ash-Leaved Maple= (_Acer negundo_) (Box Elder). Medium- to  large-sized tree. Heartwood creamy white, sapwood nearly white. Wood  light, soft, close-grained, not strong. Used for woodenware and paper  pulp. Distributed across the continent, abundant throughout the  Mississippi Valley along banks of streams and borders of swamps.    =63. Striped Maple= (_Acer Pennsylvanicum_) (Moose-wood). Small-sized  tree. Produces a very white wood much sought after for inlaid and for  cabinet work. Wood is light, soft, close-grained, and takes a fine  polish. Not common. Occurs from Pennsylvania to Minnesota.                                     MULBERRY    =64. Red Mulberry= (_Morus rubra_). A small-sized tree. Wood moderately  heavy, fairly hard and strong, rather tough, of coarse texture, very  durable in contact with the soil. The sapwood whitish, heartwood  yellow to orange brown, shrinks and checks considerably in drying,  works well and stands well. Used in cooperage and locally in  construction, and in the manufacture of farm implements. Common in the  Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, but widely distributed in the eastern  United States.                                MYRTLE (See Laurel)                            "]]]
