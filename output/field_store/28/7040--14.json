[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],[0,"Rebel Spurs (#14)"],[1,"a chance to read it though.\" He set _The Count of Monte Cristo_  upright on the table. Anse took the third volume.    \"... _Con--Conquest of Mexico_. Hey, conquest means winnin' th' country,  don't it? This about the Mex War which our pa's fought?\" He flicked open  the pages eagerly.    \"No, the earlier one--when the Spanish came in under Cortes and broke up  the Aztec empire ... back in the 1500's.\"    \"Kinda stiff readin' ... looks interestin' though.\" Anse gave his verdict.  \"We had us two books. Pa learned us to read outta them. One was th' Bible  Ma brought long when she was married. T'other--that sure was kinda queer  how we got that. Pa was in th' Rangers, an' he had this run-in with some  Comanches--\" Anse's eyes were suddenly bleak, and Drew remembered the few  stark sentences the Texan had once spoken to explain his reason for being  in the army--a return to a frontier ranch to find nothing left, nothing he  wanted to remember, after the Comanches had swept across the countryside.    \"Well,\" Anse broke that short pause, \"Pa shot him one big buck as was  ridin' straight into th' Ranger line, wantin' to count one o' them coups  by whangin' some white man personal with his lance, or some such  foolishness. This buck had him a war shield an' Pa picked it up when all  th' smoke blew away. What'd' you think that there shield was packed with?  Well, this one had a book all tore apart an' stuffed in between th' front  an' back layers of hide. Th' boys in th' company, they got right  interested in sortin' out all them pages an' puttin' 'em in order agin,  kinda like a game, Pa said. Pa, he never had much schoolin', but he could  read good an' write an' figger. He sure liked to read, so he claimed that  there book when it was all tied up together agin--'cause he shot th' buck  as was carryin' th' shield. So he made a buckskin case and kept all th'  pages together. That was 'bout soldiers of th' old time, too--parts of it.  Romans they was called. Wonder now--did it maybe go back into a shield agin  afterward?\" He gazed beyond Drew's shoulder into the world outside the  cantina door.    \"Why would anyone want to store books in a trunk in a cave?\" Drew changed  the subject quickly to break that unseeing stare. He outlined what Stein  had told him, and Anse's attention was all his again.    \"Might catch up with this Lutterfield an' ask a few questions--\"    \"Stein couldn't get anythin' out of him. Guess the old man is a little  addled. Maybe someone was storin' stuff, hopin' to come back when the war  was over. Anyway, there's no way to identify the owner or owners--\"    Anse picked up _The Three Musketeers_. \"You say this is good--'bout  fightin' an' such?\"    Drew nodded. \"Try it ...\"    \"Somethin' like this is good t' have. A hombre gits tired readin' labels  on cans. I'd like to see how much Pa pushed into m' thick head. Good  coverin' this book has. Wouldn't you say as th' hombre that had it was  kinda heavy in th' pocket?\"    \"Yes. In fact, these were bound to order.\"    \"How can you tell that?\"    \"These two might have come bound alike.\" Drew pointed to the book Anse  held and _The Count of Monte Cristo_. \"They were written by the same  author and could have been part of a matched set. But this one is on a  totally different subject and by another writer--Prescott. Yet it is  uniformly bound to match the others. I'd say they came from the personal  library of a man able to indulge himself in pretty expensive tastes.\"    \"Makes you think,\" Anse agreed. \"Wonder what else was in that trunk.\"    \"Looky what we've got us here! Regular li'l schoolhouse right in this  cantina!\"    The table moved an inch or so as a thick body brought up with a rush  against it. A hand, matted with sun-bleached hair, made a grab for the  book Drew had just laid down. Before the startled Kentuckian could pull it  back from that grasp, hand and book were gone, and the trooper who had  taken it was reeling back to the bar, waving the trophy over his head.    \"Schoolhouse ... right here ...\" he mouthed. \"Sittin' there ... two li'l  boys, studyin' their lessons. Now, ain't that somethin'?\"    A chair went over with a crash. Anse was on his feet, had taken two steps  in the direction of the soldier. Drew jumped after him, trying to assess  the situation even as his hand closed restrainingly on the Texan's  shoulder.    There were four troopers. Wide grins on the faces of the three still  against the bar suggested they were ready to back their companion in any  form of horseplay he intended to try.    \"Sam, one o' them thar schoolboys is breathin' down yore neck kinda hot  like,\" the tallest of the bar row observed.    Anse jerked against Drew's hold. There was no expression on his thin face,  but the old saber scar from lip to eye on his left cheek was suddenly  twice as noticeable.    Sam reached up against the bar, squirmed around, the book still in his  hand.    \"Wal, now, sonny, you ain't really wantin' this here book back? Never  knowed any li'l boy what warn't glad to see th' last o' a book. Better git  away from a real man 'fore you gits yore backside warmed. That's what th'  teacher does to smarty kids, ain't it?\"    \"You'd better watch out, Sam.\" Again the tall man cut in. Sam was still  grinning, but there was a curve of lip which was far from any real humor,  even that provoked by the practical jokes of a barracks bully. \"One of  them kids had been sayin' as how he rode with Forrest, regular li'l  red-hot Reb, he is. Stomp all over us ... that's what you Rebs has been  promisin' to do, ain't it? Gonna stomp all over any Blue Bellies as comes  into this town? Well, we ain't bein' booted--not easy--an' not by you, Reb!\"    A second, perhaps more--that much warning Drew had before the speaker  lurched from the bar straight for him. What had happened, how this had  sprung up out of nothing, the Kentuckian could not understand. But he knew  well that he was under an attack delivered with a purpose, and with all  the dirty tricks of a no-rules, back-alley fighter.            8      Only once before, when some river toughs had ganged up on the scouts, had  Drew had to use fists to beat his way out of an argument. But that had  been a round dance at Court House Day compared to this. Within moments the  Kentuckian knew that he was no match for the trooper, that he would be  lucky if he could get out of this unmaimed. The fellow knew every dirty  trick and was eager to use them all. Drew tried only to keep on his feet  and out of the other's grip. Once down, he knew he would have no chance at  all.    Then he was jerked back, off balance, staggering on to bring up against  the wall. He caught at the solid backing and somehow remained upright,  seeing hazily through one eye. The other was puffing closed, and his lip  was torn, a trickle of blood rising there to drip down his chin. He put  both hands to his middle where more than one of the pile-driver knocks had  landed, and tried to understand what was happening.    Sergeant Muller ... that was Muller standing over the man on the floor.  And Nye ... Reese Topham ... suddenly the cantina was very well populated.  Drew turned his head cautiously to see on his blind side. Anse was down!  The Kentuckian stood away from the wall, lurched out to fall to his knees.  He rolled the Texan over on his back. Anse's eyes fluttered open, and he  looked up dazedly. There was an angry red mark on his chin just an inch or  so away from the point of his jaw.    \"Now, just what devil's business is goin' on here?\" The sergeant's voice  was a roar to hurt the ears. Somehow Drew got an arm under Anse's  shoulders and tried to hoist him up. The Kentuckian swallowed blood from  his lip and glared at Muller.    \"Suppose you ask those high-binders of yours!\" he snapped. And once more  it was Sergeant Rennie who spoke.    Other hands joined his to boost Anse. With Topham's aid Drew regained his  feet and got the staggering Texan, still half unconscious, onto a chair.    \"I'm interested, too.\" The cantina owner's drawl was as slow as ever, but  it held a note of a whiplash.    \"Them soldiers....\" Fowler appeared, the bar-side shotgun across his  arm--\"they jumped th' boys. I saw it, myself.\"    \"Yeah, told yuh these town buzzards're all th' same. Stick together an'  have it in for th' army!\"    Drew could not see which of the troopers had burst out with that, but in  his present mood all bluecoats were the enemy.    \"Dirty Yanks!\" Anse's eyes were fully focused now--right on the sergeant.  Anse struggled to get up, but Topham's hands on his shoulders held him  down. His hand went to his holster, and Drew's fist came down on the  Texan's wrist, hard.    \"See that thar, Sarge! Th' stinkin' polecat of a Reb was gonna draw on  you! Told you, they's all alike. Th' war ain't over; we jus' gotta keep on  lickin' 'em. Give us room, an' we'll do it again--now!\"    Anse's face was green-white under the weathering, save for the wound on  his jaw. He was watching Muller as if the sergeant, rather than his men,  was the focal point of any future attack.    \"You--Stevens--shut your trap!\" Muller's roar brought silence. Drew could  actually hear the panting breaths of the men now.    \"Mitchell, what happened here?\" Muller turned to the man at his far right.    The trooper was younger than the rest, his face still holding something of  a boyish roundness. His eyes shifted under the sergeant's steady, boring  stare, and he glanced at the rest of his companions, the two disheveled  fighters, the lanky man picking up a forage cap and handing it to one of  them.    \"I dunno, Sergeant. Th' boys ... they was jus' funnin'. They didn't meant  nothin', jus' funnin'. Then these here Rebs, they come right after Helms,  was gonna jump him from behind. An' Danny waded in jus' to keep that  one\"--the boy pointed straight at Drew--\"offa Helms. That's what happened.  Th' boys didn't mean no harm--jus' havin' a little fun--when these Rebs  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#14)"],[1,"Chisel.        Barnard, pp. 59-73.

WOOD HAND TOOLS.      4. SCRAPING TOOLS.    Scraping tools are of such nature that they can only abrade or smooth  surfaces.    [Illustration: Fig. 142. Auger-Bit-File.]    [Illustration: Fig. 143. Single-Cut Blunt, Flat, Bastard File.]    [Illustration: Fig. 144. Three-Square Single-Cut File.]    [Illustration: Fig. 145. Open Cut, Taper, Half-Round File.]    [Illustration: Fig. 146. Double-Cut File.]    [Illustration: Fig. 147. Cabinet Wood-Rasp.]    [Illustration: Fig. 148. File-Card.]    _Files._ Figs. 142-146, are formed with a series of cutting edges or  teeth. These teeth are cut when the metal is soft and cold and  then the tool is hardened. There are in use at least three thousand  varieties of files, each of which is adapted to its particular  purpose. Lengths are measured from point to heel exclusive of the  tang. They are classified: (1) according to their outlines into  blunt, (i. e., having a uniform cross section thruout), and taper;  (2) according to the shape of their cross-section, into flat, square,  three-square or triangular, knife, round or rat-tail, half-round,  etc.; (3) according to the manner of their serrations, into single cut  or \"float\" (having single, unbroken, parallel, chisel cuts across the  surface), double-cut, (having two sets of chisel cuts crossing each  other obliquely,) open cut, (having series of parallel cuts, slightly  staggered,) and safe edge, (or side,) having one or more uncut  surfaces; and (4) according to the fineness of the cut, as rough,  bastard, second cut, smooth, and dead smooth. The \"mill file,\" a very  common form, is a flat, tapered, single-cut file.    [Illustration: Fig. 149. a. Diagram of a Rasp Tooth. b. Cross-Section  of a Single-Cut File.]    _Rasps_, Fig. 147, differ from files in that instead of having  cutting teeth made by lines, coarse projections are made by making  indentations with a triangular point when the iron is soft. The  difference between files and rasps is clearly shown in Fig. 149.    It is a good rule that files and rasps are to be used on wood only  as a last resort, when no cutting tool will serve. Great care must be  taken to file flat, not letting the tool rock. It is better to file  only on the forward stroke, for that is the way the teeth are made to  cut, and a flatter surface is more likely to be obtained.    Both files and rasps can be cleaned with a _file-card_, Fig. 148. They  are sometimes sharpened with a sandblast, but ordinarily when dull are  discarded.    [Illustration: Fig. 150. Molding-Scrapers.]    _Scrapers_ are thin, flat pieces of steel. They may be rectangular, or  some of the edges may be curved. For scraping hollow surfaces curved  scrapers of various shapes are necessary. Convenient shapes are shown  in Fig. 150. The cutting power of scrapers depends upon the delicate  burr or feather along their edges. When properly sharpened they take  off not dust but fine shavings. Scrapers are particularly useful in  smoothing cross-grained pieces of wood, and in cleaning off glue, old  varnish, etc.    There are various devices for holding scrapers in frames or handles,  such as the scraper-plane, Fig. 111, p. 79, the veneer-scraper, and  box-scrapers. The _veneer-scraper_, Fig. 151, has the advantage that  the blade may be sprung to a slight curve by a thumb-screw in the  middle of the back, just as an ordinary scraper is when held in the  hands.    In use, Fig. 152, the scraper may be either pushed or pulled. When  pushed, the scraper is held firmly in both hands, the fingers on the  forward and the thumbs on the back side. It is tilted forward, away  from the operator, far enough so that it will not chatter and is bowed  back slightly, by pressure of the thumbs, so that there is no risk of  the corners digging in. When pulled the position is reversed.    [Illustration: Fig. 151. Using a Veneer-Scraper.]    One method of sharpening the scraper is as follows: the scraper is  first brought to the desired shape, straight or curved. This may be  done either by grinding on the grindstone or by filing with a smooth,  flat file, the scraper, while held in a vise. The edge is then  carefully draw-filed, i. e., the file, a smooth one, is held (one hand  at each end) directly at right angles to the edge of the scraper, Fig.  153, and moved sidewise from end to end of the scraper, until the edge  is quite square with the sides. Then the scraper is laid flat on the  oilstone and rubbed, first on one side and then on the other till the  sides are bright and smooth along the edge, Fig. 154. Then it is  set on edge on the stone and rubbed till there are two sharp square  corners all along the edge, Fig. 155. Then it is put in the vise again  and by means of a burnisher, or scraper steel, both of these corners  are carefully turned or bent over so as to form a fine burr. This is  done by tipping the scraper steel at a slight angle with the edge and  rubbing it firmly along the sharp corner, Fig. 156.    [Illustration: Fig. 152. Using a Cabinet-Scraper.]    To resharpen the scraper it is not necessary to file it afresh every  time, but only to flatten out the edges and turn them again with  slightly more bevel. Instead of using the oilstone an easier, tho  less perfect, way to flatten out the burr on the edges is to lay the  scraper flat on the bench near the edge. The scraper steel is then  passed rapidly to and fro on the flat side of the scraper, Fig. 157.  After that the edge should be turned as before.    [Illustration: Fig. 153. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 1st Step,  Drawfiling.]    _Sandpaper._ The \"sand\" is crushed quartz and is very hard and sharp.  Other materials on paper or cloth are also used, as carborundum,  emery, and so on. Sandpaper comes in various grades of coarseness from  No. 00 (the finest) to No. 3, indicated on the back of each sheet. For  ordinary purposes No. 00 and No. 1 are sufficient. Sandpaper sheets  may readily be torn by placing the sanded side down, one-half of  the sheet projecting over the square edge of the bench. With a quick  downward motion the projecting portion easily parts. Or it may be torn  straight by laying the sandpaper on a bench, sand side down, holding  the teeth of a back-saw along the line to be torn. In this case, the  smooth surface of the sandpaper would be against the saw.    [Illustration: Fig. 154. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 2nd Step,  Whetting.]    [Illustration: Fig. 155. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 3rd Step,  Removing the Wire-Edge.]    Sandpaper should never be used to scrape and scrub work into shape,  but only to obtain an extra smoothness. Nor ordinarily should it be  used on a piece of wood until all the work with cutting tools is done,  for the fine particles of sand remaining in the wood dull the edge of  the tool. Sometimes in a piece of cross-grained wood rough places will  be discovered by sandpapering. The surface should then be wiped free  of sand and scraped before using a cutting tool again. In order to  avoid cross scratches, work should be \"sanded\" with the grain, even if  this takes much trouble. For flat surfaces, and to touch off edges,  it is best to wrap the sandpaper over a rectangular block of wood,  of which the corners are slightly rounded, or it may be fitted over  special shapes of wood for specially shaped surfaces. The objection  to using the thumb or fingers instead of a block, is that the soft  portions of the wood are cut down faster than the hard portions,  whereas the use of a block tends to keep the surface even.    [Illustration: Fig. 156. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 4th Step,  Turning the Edge.]    _Steel wool_ is made by turning off fine shavings from the edges of  a number of thin discs of steel, held together in a lathe. There  are various grades of coarseness, from No. 00 to No. 3. Its uses  are manifold: as a substitute for sandpaper, especially on curved  surfaces, to clean up paint, and to rub down shellac to an \"egg-shell\"  finish. Like sandpaper it should not be used till all the work with  cutting tools is done. It can be manipulated until utterly worn out.      5. POUNDING TOOLS.    The _hammer_ consists of two distinct parts, the head and the handle.  The head is made of steel, so hard that it will not be indented by  hitting against nails or the butt of nailsets, punches, etc., which  are comparatively soft. It can easily be injured tho, by being driven  against steel harder than itself. The handle is of hickory and of an  oval shape to prevent its twisting in the hand.    [Illustration: Fig. 157. Resharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: Flattening  the Edge.]    Hammers may be classified as follows: (1) hammers for striking blows  only; as, the blacksmith's hammer and the stone-mason's hammer, and  (2) compound hammers, which consist of two tools combined, the face  for striking,"]]]
