And they visited with the same treatment all the other  officers sent to them, until they were disbanded by the British on  the province of Allahabad being made over to the Company. Colonel  Sleeman notes that they were never known to offer any other violence  or insult to females than to make them give up any gold ornaments that  they might have about their persons. \"In all my inquiries into the  character, habits and conduct of these gangs, I have never found an  instance of a female having been otherwise disgraced or insulted by  them. They are all Hindus, and this reverence for the sex pervades  all Hindu society.\" [57] According to their own account also they  never committed murder; if people opposed them they struck and killed  like soldiers, but this was considered to be in fair fight. It may  be noted, nevertheless, that they had little idea of clan loyalty,  and informed very freely against their fellows when this course was  to their advantage. They also stated that they could not settle in  towns; they had always been accustomed to live in the jungles and  commit dacoities upon the people of the towns as a kind of _shikar_  (sport); they delighted in it, and they felt living in towns or among  other men as a kind of prison, and got quite confused (_ghabraye_),  and their women even more than the men.        8. Caste rules and admission of outsiders.      The Badhaks had a regular caste organisation, and members of the  different clans married with each other like the Rajputs after  whom they were named. They admitted freely into the community  members of any respectable Hindu caste, but not the impure castes  or Muhammadans. But at least one instance of the admission of  a Muhammadan is given. [58] The Badhaks were often known to the  people as Siarkhawa or jackal-eaters, or Sabkhawa, those who eat  everything. And the Muhammadan in question was given jackal's flesh  to eat, and having partaken of it was considered to have become a  member of the community. This indicates that the Badhaks were probably  accustomed to eat the flesh of the jackal at a sacrificial meal,  and hence that they worshipped the jackal, revering it probably  as the deity of the forests where they lived. Such a veneration  would account for the importance attached to the jackal's cry as an  omen. The fact of their eating jackals also points to the conclusion  that the Badhaks were not Rajputs, but a low hunting caste like the  Pardhis and Bahelias. The Pardhis have Rajput sept names as well as the  Badhaks. No doubt a few outcaste Rajputs may have joined the gangs and  become their leaders. Others, however, said that they abstained from  the flesh of jackals, snakes, foxes and cows and buffaloes. Children  were frequently adopted, being purchased in large numbers in time  of famine, and also occasionally kidnapped. They were brought up to  the trade of dacoity, and if they showed sufficient aptitude for it  were taken out on expeditions, but otherwise left at home to manage  the household affairs. They were married to other adopted children  and were known as Ghulami or Slave Badhaks, like the Jangar Banjaras;  and like them also, after some generations, when their real origin had  been forgotten, they became full Badhaks. It was very advantageous to  a Badhak to have a number of children, because all plunder obtained was  divided in regularly apportioned shares among the whole community. Men  who were too old to go on dacoity also received their share, and all  children, even babies born during the absence of the expedition. The  Badhaks said that this rule was enforced because they thought it an  advantage to the community that families should be large and their  numbers should increase; from which statement it must be concluded  that they seldom suffered any stringency from lack of spoil. They  also stated that Badhak widows would go and find a second husband  from among the regular population, and as a rule would sooner or  later persuade him to join the Badhaks.        9. Religion: offerings to ancestors.      Like other Indian criminals the Badhaks were of a very religious  or superstitious disposition. They considered the gods of the Hindu  creed as favouring their undertakings so long as they were suitably  propitiated by offering to their temples and priests, and the spirits  of the most distinguished of their ancestors as exercising a vicarious  authority under these deities in guiding them to their prey and warning  them of danger. [59] The following is an account of a Badhak sacrifice  given to Colonel Sleeman by the Ajit Singh already mentioned. It was  in celebration of a dacoity in which they had obtained Rs. 40,000,  out of which Rs. 4500 were set aside for sacrifices to the gods and  charity to the poor. Ajit Singh said: \"For offerings to the gods we  purchase goats, sweet cakes and spirits; and having prepared a feast  we throw a handful of the savoury food upon the fire in the name of  the gods who have most assisted us; but of the feast so consecrated  no female but a virgin can partake. The offering is made through the  man who has successfully invoked the god on that particular occasion;  and, as my god had guided us this time, I was employed to prepare the  feast for him and to throw the offering upon the fire. The offering  must be taken up before the feast is touched and put upon the fire,  and a little water must be sprinkled on it. The savoury smell of the  food as it burns reaches the nostrils of the god and delights him. On  this as on most occasions I invoked the spirit of Ganga Singh, my  grandfather, and to him I made the offering. I considered him to be  the greatest of all my ancestors as a robber, and him I invoked on this  solemn occasion. He never failed me when I invoked him, and I had the  greatest confidence in his aid. The spirits of our ancestors can easily  see whether we shall succeed in what we are about to undertake; and  when we are to succeed they order us on, and when we are not they make  signs to us to desist.\" Their mode [60] of ascertaining which of their  ancestors interested himself most in their affairs was commonly this,  that whenever a person talked incoherently in a fever or an epileptic  fit, the spirit of one or other of his ancestors was supposed to be  upon him. If they were in doubt as to whose spirit it was, one of them  threw down some grains of wheat or coloured glass beads, a pinch at  a time, saying the name of the ancestor he supposed the most likely  to be at work and calling odd or even as he pleased. If the number  proved to be as he called it several times running while that name  was repeated, they felt secure of their family god, and proceeded at  once to sacrifice a goat or something else in his name. When they were  being hunted down and arrested by Colonel Sleeman and his assistants,  they ascribed their misfortunes to the anger of the goddess Kali,  because they had infringed her rules and disregarded her signs, and  said that their forefathers had often told them they would one day  be punished for their disobedience. [61]        10. The wounded haunted by spirits.      Whenever one of the gang was wounded and was taken with his wounds  bleeding near a place haunted by a spirit, they believed the spirit  got angry and took hold of him, [62] in the manner described by  Ajit Singh as follows: \"The spirit comes upon him in all kinds of  shapes, sometimes in that of a buffalo, at others in that of a woman,  sometimes in the air above and sometimes from the ground below; but no  one can see him except the wounded person he is angry with and wants  to punish. Upon such a wounded person we always place a naked sword  or some other sharp steel instrument, as spirits are much afraid of  weapons of this kind. If there be any good conjurer at hand to charm  away the spirits from the person wounded he recovers, but nothing else  can save him.\" In one case a dacoit named Ghisa had been severely  wounded in an encounter and was seized by the spirit of a banyan  tree as he was being taken away: \"We made a litter with our ropes  and cloaks thrown over them and on this he was carried off by four  of our party; at half a mile distant the road passed under a large  banyan tree and as the four men carried him along under the tree,  the spirit of the place fell upon him and the four men who carried  him fell down with the shock. They could not raise him again, so much  were they frightened, and four other men were obliged to lift him and  carry him off.\" The man died of his wounds soon after they reached  the halting-place, and in commenting on this Ajit Singh continued:  \"When the spirit seized Ghisa under the tree we had unfortunately no  conjurer, and he, poor fellow, died in consequence. It was evident that  a spirit had got hold of him, for he could not keep his head upright;  it always fell down upon his right or left shoulder as often as we  tried to put it right; and he complained much of a pain in the region  of the liver. We therefore concluded that the spirit had broken his  neck and was consuming his liver.\"        11. Pious funeral observances.      Like pious Hindus as they were, the Badhaks were accustomed, whenever  it was possible, to preserve the bones of their dead after the body  had been burnt and carry them to the Ganges. If this was not possible,  however, and the exigencies of their profession obliged them to make  away with the body without the performance of due funeral rites,  they cut off two or three fingers and sent these to the Ganges to  be deposited instead of the whole body. [63] In one case a dacoit,  Kundana, was killed in an affray, and the others carried off his body  and thrust it into a porcupine's hole after cutting off three of the  fingers. \"We gave Kundana's fingers to his mother,\" Ajit Singh stated,  \"and she sent them with due"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22042"],[0,"Christmas: Its Origin and Associations (#14)"],[1,"THE ROSES.    (1215-1485.)    Soon after the disaster which overtook John's army at the Wash the  King ended his wretched career by death. He died on October 18, 1216,  in the castle of Newark on the Trent, and the old chroniclers describe  him as dying in an extremity of agony and remorse.      HENRY THE THIRD,    sometimes called \"Henry of Winchester,\" came to the throne in  troublous times, before he was ten years of age. The tyranny of his  father had alienated every class of his subjects, and the barons who  had obtained Magna Charta from King John had called in Louis of  France. But through the conciliatory measures of the Regent Pembroke  towards the barons, and the strong support which the Roman Church gave  the boy-king (whose father had meanly done homage to the Pope), the  foreigners were expelled, and the opposition of the barons was  suppressed for a time, though in later years they again struggled with  the crown for supremacy of power. When Henry had grown to manhood and  the responsibility of government rested upon his own shoulders, he  still exulted in the protection of the Holy See, which found in him a  subservient vassal. He fasted during Lent, but feasted right royally  both at Christmas and Easter. In 1234 he kept a grand Christmas in the  Great Hall at Westminster, and other royal Christmases were celebrated  at Windsor Castle and at his palace at Winchester. He made large  additions to Windsor Castle, and some of his mandates giving minute  directions for the decoration of his palace at Winchester are still  preserved. He enjoyed the old plays and ballets of Christmastide  introduced from France at this period.    [Illustration: ROYAL PARTY DINING IN STATE.]    Henry the Third's most splendid Christmas was in the twentieth year of  his reign, when he welcomed Eleanor, daughter of the Count of  Provence, to whom he was married on January 14, 1236. The youthful  princess left Provence amidst the rejoicings of the whole kingdom.  She was accompanied by Henry's ambassadors and a grand cavalcade, in  which were more than three hundred ladies on horseback. Her route lay  through Navarre and France. On reaching England, at Dover, the  princess and her train proceeded to Canterbury, where Henry awaited  their coming. It was in that ancient city that the royal pair were  married by the Archbishop Edmund and the prelates who accompanied  Eleanor. From Canterbury the newly-wedded king and queen set out for  London, attended by a splendid array of nobles, prelates, knights and  ladies. On the 20th of January, Eleanor was crowned at Westminster  with great splendour. Matthew Paris, the historian, gives an  interesting description of the royal procession, and the loyal welcome  of the citizens of London: \"There had assembled together so great a  number of the nobility of both sexes, so great a number of religious  orders, so great a concourse of the populace, and so great a variety  of players, that London could scarcely contain them in her capacious  bosom. Therefore was the city adorned with silk hangings, and with  banners, crowns, palls, tapers, and lamps, and with certain marvellous  ingenuities and devices; all the streets being cleaned from dirt, mud,  sticks and everything offensive. The citizens of London going to meet  the king and queen, ornamented and trapped and wondrously sported  their swift horses; and on the same day they went from the City to  Westminster, that they might discharge the service of butler to the  king in his coronation, which is acknowledged to belong to them of  ancient right. They went in well-marshalled array, adorned in silken  vestments, wrapped in gold-woven mantles, with fancifully-devised  garments, sitting on valuable horses refulgent with new bits and  saddles: and they bore three hundred and sixty gold and silver cups,  the king's trumpeters going before and sounding their trumpets; so  that so wonderful a novelty produced a laudable astonishment in the  spectators.\" The literary monk of St. Albans also describes the  splendour of the feast, and the order of the service of the different  vassals of the crown, many of whom were called upon at the coronation  to perform certain peculiar services. According to the ancient City  records, \"these served in order in that most elegant and unheard-of  feast: the Bishop of Chichester, the Chancellor, with the cup of  precious stones, which was one of the ancient regalia of the king,  clothed in his pontificals, preceded the king, who was clad in royal  attire, and wearing the crown. Hugh de Pateshall walked before with  the patine, clothed in a dalmatica; and the Earls of Chester, Lincoln,  and Warren, bearing the swords, preceded him. But the two renowned  knights, Sir Richard Siward and Sir Nicholas de Molis, carried the two  royal sceptres before the king; and the square purple cloth of silk,  which was supported upon four silver lances, with four little bells of  silver gilt, held over the king wherever he walked, was carried by the  barons of the Cinque Ports; four being assigned to each lance, from  the diversity of ports, that one port should not seem to be preferred  before the other. The same in like manner bore a cloth of silk over  the queen, walking behind the king, which said cloths they claimed to  be theirs by right, and obtained them. And William de Beauchamp of  Bedford, who had the office of almoner from times of old, found the  striped cloth or _burel_, which was laid down under the king's feet as  he went from the hall as far as the pulpit of the Church of  Westminster; and that part of the cloth that was _within_ the Church  always fell to the sexton in whatever church the king was crowned; and  all that was _without_ the church was distributed among the poor, by  the hands of William the almoner.\" The ancient records contain many  other particulars respecting the ceremonies which graced the marriage  feast of Henry and Eleanor of Provence, but enough has been quoted to  show the magnificence of the celebration.    Year by year, as the Christmas festival came round, it was royally  celebrated wherever the Court happened to be, even though the king had  to pledge his plate and jewels with the citizens of London to  replenish his exchequer. But Henry's Royal Christmases did not allay  the growing disaffection of his subjects on account of his showing too  much favour to foreigners; and some of the barons who attended the  Royal Christmas at Westminster in 1241, left in high dudgeon, because  the place of honour at the banquet was occupied by the papal legate,  then about to leave England, \"to the sorrow of no man but the king.\"  In 1252, Henry gave in marriage his beautiful daughter Margaret, to  Alexander, King of the Scots, and held his Christmas at the same time.  The city of York was the scene of the regal festivities. The marriage  took place on Christmas Day, the bridegroom and many of his nobles  receiving knighthood at the hands of the English king. Henry seems to  have conciliated the English barons for a time, for most of them were  present at the marriage festivities, and he counted a thousand knights  in his train; while Alexander brought sixty splendidly-attired  Scottish knights with him. That the banqueting was on no mean scale is  evident from the fact that six hundred fat oxen were slaughtered for  the occasion, the gift of the Archbishop of York, who also subscribed  four thousand marks (L2,700) towards the expenses. The consumption of  meats and drinks at such feasts was enormous. An extant order of  Henry's, addressed to his keeper of wines, directs him to deliver two  tuns of white and one of red wine, to make garhiofilac and claret 'as  usual,' for the king at Christmas; and upon another occasion the  Sheriffs of Gloucestershire and Sussex were called upon to supply part  of the necessary provisions; the first named being directed to get  twenty salmon, and make pies of them; while the latter was instructed  to send ten peacocks, ten brawns with their heads, and other things.  And all this provision was necessary, for while Henry feasted the  rich, he did not forget the poor. When he kept his Christmas at  Winchester in 1248, he ordered his treasurer to fill Westminster Hall  with poor people, and feast them there for a week. Twenty years  afterwards, he kept his Royal Christmas in London for fifteen days,  opening a fair meantime at Westminster, and forbidding any shop to be  opened in London as long as the festival lasted. This prohibition of  business naturally displeased the citizens of London, but the king  would not withdraw his prohibition until they agreed to make him a  present of two thousand pounds, upon the receipt of which the  prohibition was withdrawn.    We cannot pass over this period without reference to the summoning of      THE FIRST ENGLISH PARLIAMENT,    which was a great event of Christmastide.    The Barons' Wars interfered seriously with the Christmas festivities,  but they solved the problem of how to ensure the government of the  realm in accordance with the provisions of the Great Charter. The King  (Henry III.) had sworn again and again to observe the Charter, but his  oath was no sooner taken than it was unscrupulously broken. The  barons, with the patriotic Simon de Montfort at their head, were  determined to uphold the rights of the people, and insisted on the  king's compliance with the provisions of the Charter; and this  struggle with the Crown yielded one of the greatest events of  Christmastide: the summoning of the first national Parliament. By  summoning the representatives of the cities and boroughs to sit beside  the knights of the shires, the barons and the bishops in the  Parliament of the realm, Simon de Montfort created a new force in  English politics. This first national assembly met at Westminster, in  January, 1265, while the king was a prisoner of Earl Simon. The form  of national representation thus inaugurated had an"]]]
