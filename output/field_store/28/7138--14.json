A minute later there sped  from the far side of the thicket a small Gray-wolf and a Black One of  very much greater size.    \"By golly, if he didn't yell for help, and Billy come back to help him;  that's great!\" exclaimed the wolver. And my heart went out to the brave  old Wolf that refused to escape by abandoning his friend.    The next hour was a hard repetition of the gully riding, but it was on  the highlands where there was snow, and when again the pack was split,  we strained every power and succeeded in keeping them on the big  \"five-fifty track,\" that already was wearing for me the glamour of  romance.    Evidently the Dogs preferred either of the others, but we got them  going at last. Another half hour's hard work and far ahead, as I rose  to a broad flat plain, I had my first glimpse of the Big Black Wolf of  Sentinel Butte.    \"Hurrah! Badlands Billy! Hurrah! Badlands Billy!\" I shouted in salute,  and the others took up the cry.    We were on his track at last, thanks to himself. The Dogs joined in  with a louder baying, the Greyhounds yelped and made straight for him,  and the Horses sniffed and sprang more gamely as they caught the  thrill. The only silent one was the black-maned Wolf, and as I marked  his size and power, and above all his long and massive jaws, I knew why  the Dogs preferred some other trail.    With head and tail low he was bounding over the snow. His tongue was  lolling long; plainly he was hard pressed. The wolvers' hands flew to  their revolvers, though he was three hundred yards ahead; they were out  for blood, not sport. But an instant later he had sunk from view in the  nearest sheltered canyon.    Now which way would he go, up or down the canyon? Up was toward his  mountain, down was better cover. King and I thought \"up,\" so pressed  westward along the ridge. But the others rode eastward, watching for a  chance to shoot.    Soon we had ridden out of hearing. We were wrong--the Wolf had gone  down, but we heard no shooting. The canyon was crossable here; we  reached the other side and then turned back at a gallop, scanning the  snow for a trail, the hills for a moving form, or the wind for a sound  of life.    \"Squeak, squeak,\" went our saddle leathers, \"puff-puff\" our Horses, and  their feet \"ka-ka-lump, ka-ka-lump.\"      X    WHEN BILLY WENT BACK TO HIS MOUNTAIN    We were back opposite to where the Wolf had plunged, but saw no sign.  We rode at an easy gallop, on eastward, a mile, and still on, when King  gasped out, \"Look at that!\" A dark spot was moving on the snow ahead.  We put on speed. Another dark spot appeared, and another, but they were  not going fast. In five minutes we were near them, to find--three of  our own Greyhounds. They had lost sight of the game, and with that  their interest waned. Now they were seeking us. We saw nothing there of  the chase or of the other hunters. But hastening to the next ridge we  stumbled on the trail we sought and followed as hard as though in view.  Another canyon came in our path, and as we rode and looked for a place  to cross, a wild din of Hounds came from its brushy depth. The clamor  grew and passed up the middle.    We raced along the rim, hoping to see the game. The Dogs appeared near  the farther side, not in a pack, but a long, straggling line. In five  minutes more they rose to the edge, and ahead of them was the great  Black Wolf. He was loping as before, head and tail low. Power was plain  in every limb, and double power in his jaws and neck, but I thought his  bounds were shorter now, and that they had lost their spring. The Dogs  slowly reached the upper level, and sighting him they broke into a  feeble cry; they, too, were nearly spent. The Greyhounds saw the chase,  and leaving us they scrambled down the canyon and up the other side at  impetuous speed that would surely break them down, while we rode,  vainly seeking means of crossing.    How the wolver raved to see the pack lead off in the climax of the  chase, and himself held up behind. But he rode and wrathed and still  rode, up to where the canyon dwindled--rough land and a hard ride. As we  neared the great flat mountain, the feeble cry of the pack was heard  again from the south, then toward the high Butte's side, and just a  trifle louder now. We reined in on a hillock and scanned the snow. A  moving speck appeared, then others, not bunched, but in a straggling  train, and at times there was a far faint cry. They were headed toward  us, coming on, yes! coming, but so slowly, for not one was really  running now. There was the grim old Cow-killer limping over the ground,  and far behind a Greyhound, and another, and farther still, the other  Dogs in order of their speed, slowly, gamely, dragging themselves on  that pursuit. Many hours of hardest toil had done their work. The Wolf  had vainly sought to fling them off. Now was his hour of doom, for he  was spent; they still had some reserve. Straight to us for a time they  came, skirting the base of the mountain, crawling.    We could not cross to join them, so held our breath and gazed with  ravenous eyes. They were nearer now, the wind brought feeble notes from  the Hounds. The big Wolf turned to the steep ascent, up a well-known  trail, it seemed, for he made no slip. My heart went with him, for he  had come back to rescue his friend, and a momentary thrill of pity came  over us both, as we saw him glance around and drag himself up the  sloping way, to die on his mountain. There was no escape for him, beset  by fifteen Dogs with men to back them. He was not walking, but  tottering upward; the Dogs behind in line, were now doing a little  better, were nearing him. We could hear them gasping; we scarcely heard  them bay--they had no breath for that; upward the grim procession went,  circling a spur of the Butte and along a ledge that climbed and  narrowed, then dropped for a few yards to a shelf that reared above the  canyon. The foremost Dogs were closing, fearless of a foe so nearly  spent.    Here in the narrowest place, where one wrong step meant death, the  great Wolf turned and faced them. With fore-feet braced, with head low  and tail a little raised, his dusky mane a-bristling, his glittering  tusks laid bare, but uttering no sound that we could hear, he faced the  crew. His legs were weak with toil, but his neck, his jaws, and his  heart were strong, and--now all you who love the Dogs had better close  the book--on--up and down--fifteen to one, they came, the swiftest  first, and how it was done, the eye could scarcely see, but even as a  stream of water pours on a rock to be splashed in broken Jets aside,  that stream of Dogs came pouring down the path, in single file  perforce, and Duskymane received them as they came. A feeble spring, a  counter-lunge, a gash, and \"Fango's down,\" has lost his foothold and is  gone. Dander and Coalie close and try to clinch; a rush, a heave, and  they are fallen from that narrow path. Blue-spot then, backed by mighty  Oscar and fearless Tige--but the Wolf is next the rock and the flash of  combat clears to show him there alone, the big Dogs gone; the rest  close in, the hindmost force the foremost on--down-to their death.  Slash, chop and heave, from the swiftest to the biggest, to the last,  down--down--he sent them whirling from the ledge to the gaping gulch  below, where rocks and snags of trunks were sharp to do their work.    In fifty seconds it was done. The rock had splashed the stream  aside--the Penroof pack was all wiped out; and Badlands Billy stood  there, alone again on his mountain.    A moment he waited to look for more to come. There were no more, the  pack was dead; but waiting he got his breath, then raising his voice  for the first time in that fatal scene, he feebly gave a long yell of  triumph, and scaling the next low bank, was screened from view in a  canyon of Sentinel Butte.    We stared like men of stone. The guns in our hands were forgotten. It  was all so quick, so final. We made no move till the Wolf was gone. It  was not far to the place: we went on foot to see if any had escaped.  Not one was left alive. We could do nothing--we could say nothing.      XI    THE HOWL AT SUNSET    A week later we were riding the upper trail back of the Chimney Pot,  King and I. \"The old man is pretty sick of it,\" he said. \"He'd sell out  if he could. He don't know what's the next move.\"    The sun went down beyond Sentinel Butte. It was dusk as we reached the  turn that led to Dumont's place, and a deep-toned rolling howl came  from the river flat below, followed by a number of higher-pitched howls  in answering chorus. We could see nothing, but we listened hard. The  song was repeated, the hunting-cry of the Wolves. It faded, the night  was stirred by another, the sharp bark and the short howl, the signal  \"close in\"; a bellow came up, very short, for it was cut short.    And King as he touched his Horse said grimly: \"That's him, he is out  with the pack, an' thar goes another Beef.\"          THE BOY AND THE LYNX    I    THE BOY    He was barely fifteen, a lover of sport and uncommonly keen, even for a  beginner. Flocks of Wild Pigeons had been coming all day across the  blue Lake of Cayggeonull, and perching in line on the dead limbs of the  great rampikes that stood as monuments of fire, around the little  clearing in the forest, they afforded tempting marks; but he followed  them for hours in vain. They seemed to know the exact range of the  old-fashioned shotgun and rose on noisy wings each time before he was  near enough to fire. At length a small flock scattered among the low  green trees that grew about the spring, near the log shanty, and taking  advantage of the cover, Thorburn went in gently. He caught sight of a  single Pigeon close to him, took a long aim and fired. A sharp crack  resounded at almost the same time and the bird fell dead."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#14)"],[1,"with the  stock-keepers. A question, however, arose, whether it were lawful to  shoot aborigines refusing to surrender on challenge. Against this  construction of law, Mr. Gellibrand earnestly protested; and  maintained, in warm terms, their claims to sympathy and  compassion--himself, alas! destined to die by the hands of the race. It  seemed, however, generally understood, that capture should be attempted  by the most merciful methods, but accomplished at all events.  Colonisation by the French, was exhibited by Mr. Hackett, the distiller,  in contrast with English; but Dr. Ross rose in reply, and stated that  there was a rock which bore the name of _The Leap_, from which the last  sixty natives of Grenada were precipitated. Mr. R. L. Murray treated the  prevailing notion of danger with derision: three women, he said, would  put a whole tribe to flight; but Mr. Home reminded the meeting, that the  grass had not yet covered the graves of a mother and her children,  recently slain. Thus, like the warriors of the heroic age, they debated  before they armed; but it is difficult to reconcile the civic temper  with military subordination: the committee nominated by the meeting to  enrol the town guard, suggested that volunteers should be allowed to  choose each their own company, as well as their own officers. One party  of twenty-four, required the choice of their post, and the right to act  as an independent division.    On the 22nd September, the plan of the campaign was minutely described  in a government order, and operations were fixed for the 7th of October.  Its main features may be briefly stated:--The Oyster Bay and Big River  tribes, as the most sanguinary, were first marked out for pursuit. They  were to be driven within the county of Buckingham; the utmost care being  employed to prevent escape through the lines, while chasing them to  Tasman's Peninsula.    A chain of posts was occupied, under Captain Welman, from St. Patrick's  Head on the east coast; including the source of St. Paul's River, and  stretching to Campbell Town. A second chain, under Major Douglas,  extending from Campbell Town, passed south of the Macquarie, to its  junction with the Lake River. Both divisions, marching in a southerly  direction, formed a line from Oyster Bay tier to Lackey's Mills. During  these manoeuvres, a party were sent to examine the tier, extending  from Swan River to Spring Bay; carefully, however, concealing the  movement from the natives, lest they should be deterred from passing the  subjacent isthmus. Other parties were employed, under Captain Wentworth,  to force the aborigines from the neighbourhood of the lakes in the west,  towards the same centre, advancing due east to the Jordan. The lines  being compressed and thickened, and joined by the settlers on their  march, were then moved forward, followed by scouring parties, to guard  against their escape, should the natives cross the line. Fires were kept  burning to direct the troops, who were expected to march in unbroken  order.    Captain Donaldson, who directed the operations in the north of the  island, swept over the vast extent of country from Norfolk Plains to the  Ouse--from Sorell Lake to Lake Echo. There he remained, closing the  avenues of escape, while Douglass and Wentworth advanced to their last  position: he then joined the main body. Twenty-two parties, under Major  Douglas, and fifteen under Captain Wentworth, were then sent within the  lines, to catch the natives, or drive them toward Tasman's Peninsula.    The distribution of provisions to this force, was entrusted to Messrs.  Scott, Wedge, and Sharland, surveyors. The rations were delivered to the  leader of each party weekly, and consisted of sugar, tea, flour, and  meat, in considerable proportions. The principle depot was at Oatlands:  where 1,000 muskets were provided, 30,000 rounds blank cartridges, 300  pairs of handcuffs, and whatever might contribute to the success of the  assailants. Many thousands of rations were stored, and the settlers saw,  with pleasure, their produce rise in the neighbourhood of this  formidable band, to twice its recent value. L2,000 was paid to one  merchant for the tobacco. The officers, to avoid its destruction,  inevitable on so long a march, mostly threw off their military clothing,  and assumed an uniform of Maria Island cloth, thus reserving their full  dress to celebrate the coming triumph. The enthusiasm was universal: a  blacksmith, at Sorell, unable to follow the army, offered to repair all  the guns belonging to the volunteers of his district. His example was  followed by another, who, having but one leg, contributed the same  service to the common cause. Nor was supplication forgotten: a form of  prayer was composed for those who used formulas, and extempore petitions  were offered by other denominations. The colony, at large, cheerfully  responded to the call of government: the military character of the plan  excited the young, without much alarming the mature. The inhabitants of  the towns readily enrolled, and the discussions every where exhibited a  curious mixture of martial ardour and civil pertinacity.    There were many old soldiers in the colony, who were amused, without  being repelled by this mimicry of war. More busy civilians, were  anxious for the formality of incorporation, and the gradations of  command. The townspeople were allowed their choice, between more active  service and garrison duties. \"Gentlemen,\" said an old soldier, \"you may  call yourselves marshals, generals, and colonels, but the duties  assigned you are usually performed by a corporal's guard.\" It is  gratifying to observe, that the last injunction of the Governor, and the  last lesson of the press, suggested humanity. Under the excitement of  losses and bereavement, the destruction of the natives had been invoked;  but now, softened by the belief that the whites were about to complete a  work which had been twenty-six years in progress, and to expatriate the  race, with one voice all said, \"spare them!\"    The forces, including the military and constabulary, amounted to nearly  five thousand; of these, 1,500 were contributed by Hobart Town, and 500  by Launceston. No army ever departed from their homes less agitated by  the uncertainties of the future; and notwithstanding the dreary picture  of the service, drawn by the colonel commanding, there was no danger  that a bridge of Lodi, or a plain of Waterloo, would be found in the  campaign. Some went out with the keenness of sportsmen who might at  least catch a kangaroo: others were contented to live moderately well at  government charge. The clerks, released from their offices, gladly  embraced a holiday: the poor prisoner acted and felt as a free man, and  rejoiced in the interval of his servitude; and keen and canny volunteers  embraced the opportunity to range the unknown territory, for the  discovery of some neglected spot, which might offer a future home.    On the 1st of October, the whole country was declared under martial law;  excepting, however, from its operation, not only the British, but such  of the aborigines as were pacific. This measure was of no great moment,  except that it authorised the pursuit of all natives in every quarter.    The journals not favorable to the scheme, predicted its failure. There  were vast probabilities against it: the nature of the force--the seat of  war--the foe--the discipline--even the orders not to kill, were all  peculiar and discouraging. Townsmen, little accustomed to fatigue, and  sportsmen not disposed to be silent, were to move sometimes in a regular  and quiet line. A shot carelessly fired, the momentary slumber of an  undisciplined sentinel, or the lazy evasion of a scout, might disconcert  the whole campaign. No Englishman could follow up the native: the array,  the number and the glancing of muskets, gave warning from afar. An  European, encumbered with his dress, could only move slowly, and when  passing the bush must pause every moment, or be tortured at every step;  but the native could swing from bough to bough, mount to the topmast  branch like an opossum, move past the people seeking him diligently, or  lie down until they were gone. To many of the colonists, the campaign  was no child's play. The pursuit of solitary white or black rangers of  the wood, was exhilarating to men of great animal courage, and who could  enjoy long intervals of rest; but a regular march, through such a  country, soon wore out the patience of many, and they were glad to  resign the glorious undertaking to more ardent warriors.    As the campaign advanced, the weather was unpropitious: crossing the  rivers became dangerous; trees had to be cut down to form temporary  bridges. These obstacles cooled the spirit of volunteers, who passed  rapidly from discontent to criticism, and from criticism to despair.  \"Many crawled home:\" such was the indignant description of their  retreat, given by their comrades; and whilst the drenched, but  decreasing forces lay along the line, young men, it was said, crowded  the streets of the capital, ignobly forgetful of the common cause.    Parties were divided into threes, each forming a night watch: fires were  lighted for the night, and illumined the whole distance of thirty miles,  from Prosser's River to Sorell; and sentinels paced within hail of each  other. The police magistrates visited the several posts on horseback,  and the Governor rode rapidly along the line, from the Clyde to Spring  Bay. Dr. Ross recording his Excellency's exertions, states, that to  allow them a full description, would leave no room for any other topic!  His labours and perils were the theme of admiration and sympathy: it was  reported, that he was lost three days in Paradise--a place renowned for  its miserable vegetation, and the dreariness of its scenery. The warlike  tone of the day may excite a smile, but the fatigue was indisputable;  and"]]]
