A friendly native race could make all the difference in the  world in any struggle with the Throgs.\"    \"Then you did have more than the dreams to back you when you argued with  Fenniston!\" Shann cut in.    Thorvald's eyes were on him again. \"When did you hear that, Lantee?\"    To his great embarrassment, Shann found himself flushing. \"I heard you,  the day you left for Headquarters,\" he admitted, and then added in his  own defense, \"Probably half the camp did, too.\"    Thorvald's gathering frown flickered away. He gave a snort of laughter.  \"Yes, I guess we did rather get to the bellowing point that morning. The  dreams--\" he came back to the subject--\"Yes, the dreams  were--are--important. We had their warning from the start. Lorry was the  First-In Scout who charted Warlock, and he is a good man. I guess I can  break secret now to tell you that his ship was equipped with a new  experimental device which recorded--well, you might call it an  \"emanation\"--a radiation so faint its source could not be traced. And it  registered whenever Lorry had one of those dreams. Unfortunately, the  machine was very new, very much in the untested stage, and its  performance when checked later in the lab was erratic enough so the  powers-that-be questioned all its readings. They produced a half dozen  answers to account for that tape, and Lorry only caught the recording as  long as he was on a big bay to the south.    \"Then when two check flights came in later, carrying perfected machines  and getting no recordings, it was all written off as a mistake in the  first experiment. A planet such as Warlock is too big a find to throw  away when there was no proof of occupancy. And the settlement boys  rushed matters right along.\"    Shann recalled his own vivid dream of the skull-rock set in the lap of  water--this sea? And another small point fell into place to furnish the  beginning of a pattern. \"I was asleep on the raft when I dreamed about  that skullmountain,\" he said slowly, wondering if he were making sense.    Thorvald's head came up with the alert stance of Taggi on a strong game  scent.    \"Yes, on the raft you dreamed of a skull-rock. And I of a cavern with a  green veil. Both of us were on water--water which had an eventual  connection with the sea. Could water be a conductor? I wonder....\" Once  again his hand went into his blouse. He crossed the strip of gravel  beach and dipped fingers into the water, letting the drops fall on the  carved disk he now held in his other hand.    \"What are you doing?\" Shann could see no purpose in that.    Thorvald did not answer. He had pressed wet hand to dry now, palm to  palm, the coin cupped tightly between them. He turned a quarter circle,  to face the still distant open sea.    \"That way.\" He spoke with a new odd tonelessness.    Shann stared into the other's face. All the eager alertness of only a  moment earlier had been wiped away. Thorvald was no longer the man he  had known, but in some frightening way a husk, holding a quite different  personality. The younger Terran answered his fear with an attack from  the old days of rough in-fighting in the Dumps of Tyr. He brought his  right hand down hard in a sharp chop across the officer's wrists. The  bone coin spun to the sand and Thorvald stumbled, staggering forward a  step or two. Before he could recover balance Shann had stamped on the  medallion.    Thorvald whirled, his stunner drawn with a speed for which Shann gave  him high marks. But the younger man's own weapon was already out and  ready. And he talked--fast.    \"That thing's dangerous! What did you do--what did it do to you?\"    His demand got through to a Thorvald who was himself again.    \"What was _I_ doing?\" came a counter demand.    \"You were acting like a mind-controlled.\"    Thorvald stared at him incredulously, then with a growing spark of  interest.    \"The minute you dripped water on that thing you changed,\" Shann  continued.    Thorvald reholstered his stunner. \"Yes,\" he mused, \"why _did_ I want to  drip water on it? Something prompted me ...\" He ran his still damp hand  up the angle of his jaw, across his forehead as if to relieve some pain  there. \"What else did I do?\"    \"Faced to the sea and said 'that way,'\" Shann replied promptly.    \"And why did you move in to stop me?\"    Shann shrugged. \"When I first touched that thing I felt a shock. And  I've seen mind-controlled----\" He could have bitten his tongue for  betraying that. The world of the mind-controlled was very far from the  life Thorvald and his kind knew.    \"Very interesting,\" commented the other. \"For one of so few years you  seem to have seen a lot, Lantee--and apparently remembered most of it.  But I would agree that you are right about this little plaything; it  carries a danger with it, being far less innocent than it looks.\" He  tore off one of the fluttering scraps of rag which now made up his  sleeve. \"If you'll just remove your foot, we'll put it out of business  for now.\"    He proceeded to wrap the disk well in his bit of cloth, taking care not  to touch it again with his bare fingers while he stowed it away.    \"I don't know what we have in this--a key to unlock a door, a trap to  catch the unwary. I can't guess how or why it works. But we can be  reasonably sure it's not just some carefree maiden's locket, nor the  equivalent of a credit to spend in the nearest bar. So it pointed me to  the sea, did it? Well, that much I am willing to allow. Maybe we'll be  able to return it to the owner, _after_ we learn who--or what--that  owner is.\"    Shann gazed down at the green water, opaque, not to be pierced to the  depths by human sight. Anything might lurk there. Suddenly the Throgs  became normal when balanced against an unknown living in the murky  depths of an aquatic world. Another attack on the Throg-held camp could  be well preferred to such exploration as Thorvald had in mind. Yet Shann  did not voice any protest as the Survey officer faced again in the same  direction as the disk had pointed him moments before.          8. UTGARD      A wind from the west sprang up an hour before sunset, lashing waves  inland until their spray was a salt mist in the air, a mist to sodden  clothing, plaster hair to the skull, leaving a brine slime across the  skin. Yet Thorvald hunted no shelter, in spite of the promise in the  rough shoreline at their backs. The sand in which their boots slipped  and slid was coarse stuff, hardly finer than gravel, studded with nests  of drift--bone-white or grayed or pale lavender--smoothed and stored by  the seasons of low tides and high, seasonal storms and hurricanes. A  wild shore and a forbidding one, to arouse Shann's distrust, perhaps a  fitting goal for that disk's guiding.    Shann had tasted loneliness in the mountains, experienced the strange  world of the river at night lighted by the wan radiance of glowing  shrubs and plants, forced the starkness of the heights. Yet there had  been through all that journeying a general resemblance to his own past  on other worlds. A tree was a tree, whether it bore purple foliage or  was red-veined. A rock was a rock, a river a river. They were equally  hard and wet on Warlock or Tyr.    But now a veil he could not describe, even in his own thoughts, hung  between him and the sand over which he walked, between him and the sea  which sent spray to wet his torn clothing, between him and that wild  wrack of long-ago storms. He could put out his hand and touch sand,  drift, spray; yet they were a setting where something lay hidden behind  that setting--something watched, calculatingly, with intelligence, and  a set of emotions and values he did not, could not share.    \"... storm coming.\" Thorvald paused in the buffeting of wind and spray,  watching the fury of the tossing sea. The sun was still a pale smear  just above the horizon. And it gave light enough to make out that  trickle of islands melting out to obscurity.    \"Utgard----\"    \"Utgard?\" Shann repeated, the strange word holding no meaning for him.    \"Legend of my people.\" Thorvald smeared spray from his face with one  hand. \"Utgard, those outermost islands where dwell the giants who are  the mortal enemies of the old gods.\"    Those dark lumps, most of them bare rock, only a few crowned with  stunted vegetation, might well harbor _anything_, Shann decided, giants  or the malignant spirits of any race. Perhaps even the Throgs had their  tales of evil things in the night, beetle monsters to people wild,  unknown lands. He caught at Thorvald's arm and suggested a practical  course of action.    \"We'll need shelter before the storm strikes.\" To Shann's relief the  other nodded.    They trailed back across the beach, their backs now to the sea and  Utgard. That harsh-sounding name did so well fit the line of islands and  islets, Shann repeated it to himself. Here the beach was narrow, a strip  of blue sand-gravel walled by wave-worn boulders. And from that barrier  of stones piled into a breastwork by chance, interwoven with bone-bare  drift, arose the first of the cliffs. Shann studied the terrain with  increasing uneasiness. To be caught between a sea, whipped inland by a  storm wind, and that cliff would be a risk he did not like to consider,  as ignorant of field lore as he was. They must locate some break nearer  than the fiord, down which they had come. And they must find it soon,  before the daylight was gone and the full fury of bad weather struck.    In the end the wolverines discovered an exit, just as they had found the  passage through the mountain. Taggi nosed into a darker line down the  face of the cliff and disappeared, Togi duplicating that feat. Shann  trailed them, finding the opening a tight squeeze.    He squirmed into dimness, his outstretched hands meeting a rough stone  surface sloping upward. After gaining a point about eight feet above the  beach he was able to look back and down through the seaward slit.

Feels longer, so they tell me, sometimes--time's  funny, beyond light-speeds. The medic says it's purely psychological.  I'm not so sure. I _itch_, blast it!\"    He moved his shoulders in a squirming way, then bent over Rugel, who was  moaning, half insensible. \"Catch hold of his feet, Bartol. Here--ease  him out of his chair. No sense bothering the medics this time. Think you  can manage to help me carry him down to the deck?\"    \"Sure,\" Bart said, finding his feet and his voice. He felt better as  they moved along the hallway, the limp, muttering form of the old Lhari  insensible in their arms. They reached the officer's deck, got Rugel  into his cabin and into his bunk, hauled off his cloak and boots. Ringg  stood shaking his head.    \"And they say Captain Vorongil's so tough!\"    Bart made a questioning noise.    \"Why, just look,\" said Ringg. \"He knows it would make poor old Rugel  feel as if he wasn't good for much--to order him into his bunk and make  him take dope like a Mentorian for every warp-shift. So we have this to  go through at every jump!\" He sounded cross and disgusted, but there was  a rough, boyish gentleness as he hauled the blanket over the bald old  Lhari. He looked up, almost shyly.    \"Thanks for helping me with Old Baldy. We usually try to get him out  before Vorongil officially takes notice. Of course, he sort of keeps his  back turned,\" Ringg said, and they laughed together as they turned back  to the drive room. Bart found himself thinking, _Ringg's a good kid_,  before he pulled himself up, in sudden shock.    He _had_ lived through warp-drive! Then, indeed, the Lhari had been  lying all along, the vicious lie that maintained their stranglehold  monopoly of star-travel. He was their enemy again, the spy within their  gates, like Briscoe, to be hunted down and killed, but to bring the  message, loud and clear, to everyone: _The Lhari lied! The stars can  belong to us all!_    When he got back to the drive room, he saw through the viewport that the  blur had vanished, the star-trails were clear, distinct again, their  comet-tails shortening by the moment, their colors more distinct.    The Lhari were waiting, a few poised over their instruments, a few more  standing at the quartz window watching the star-trails, some squirming  and scratching and grousing about \"space fleas\"--the characteristic  itching reaction that seemed to be deep down inside the bones.    Bart checked his panels, noted the time when they were due to snap back  into normal space, and went to stand by the viewport. The stars were  reappearing, seeming to steady and blaze out in cloudy splendor through  the bright dust. They burned in great streamers of flame, and for the  moment he forgot his mission again, lost in the beauty of the fiery  lights. He drew a deep, shaking gasp. It was worth it all, to see this!  He turned and saw Ringg, silent, at his shoulder.    \"Me, too,\" Ringg said, almost in a whisper. \"I think every man on board  feels that way, a little, only he won't admit it.\" His slanted gray eyes  looked quickly at Bart and away.    \"I guess we're almost down to L-point. Better check the panel and report  nulls, so medic can wake up the Mentorians.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The _Swiftwing_ moved on between the stars. Aldebaran loomed, then faded  in the viewports; another shift jumped them to a star whose human name  Bart did not know. Shift followed shift, spaceport followed spaceport,  sun followed sun; men lived on most of these worlds, and on each of them  a Lhari spaceport rose, alien and arrogant. And on each world men looked  at Lhari with resentful eyes, cursing the race who kept the stars for  their own.    Cargo amassed in the holds of the _Swiftwing_, from worlds beyond all  dreams of strangeness. Bart grew, not bored, but hardened to the  incredible. For days at a time, no word of human speech crossed his  mind.    The blackout at peak of each warp-shift persisted. Vorongil had given  him permission to report off duty, but since the blackouts did not  impair his efficiency, Bart had refused. Rugel told him that this was  the moment of equilibrium, the peak of the faster-than-light motion.    \"Perhaps a true limiting speed beyond which nothing will ever go,\"  Vorongil said, touching the charts with a varnished claw. Rugel's  scarred old mouth spread in a thin smile.    \"Maybe there's no such thing as a limiting speed. Someday we'll reach  true simultaneity--enter warp, and come out just where we want to be, at  the same time. Just a split-second interval. That will be real  transmission.\"    Ringg scoffed, \"And suppose you get even better--and come out of warp  _before_ you go into it? What then, Honorable Bald One?\"    Rugel chuckled, and did not answer. Bart turned away. It was not easy to  keep on hating the Lhari.    There came a day when he came on watch to see drawn, worried faces; and  when Ringg came into the drive room they threw their levers on  _automatic_ and crowded around him, their crests bobbing in question and  dismay. Vorongil seemed to emit sparks as he barked at Ringg, \"You found  it?\"    \"I found it. Inside the hull lining.\"    Vorongil swore, and Ringg held up a hand in protest. \"I only _locate_  metals fatigue, sir--I don't _make_ it!\"    \"No help for it then,\" Vorongil said. \"We'll have to put down for  repairs. How much time do we have, Ringg?\"    \"I give it thirty hours,\" Ringg said briefly, and Vorongil gave a long  shrill whistle. \"Bartol, what's the closest listed spaceport?\"    Bart dived for handbooks, manuals, comparative tables of position, and  started programming information. The crew drifted toward him, and by the  time he finished feeding in the coded information, a row three-deep of  Lhari surrounded him, including all the officers. Vorongil was right at  his shoulder when Bart slipped on his earphones and started decoding the  punched strips that fed out the answers from the computer.    \"Nearest port is Cottman Four. It's almost exactly thirty hours away.\"    \"I don't like to run it that close.\" Vorongil's face was bitten deep  with lines. He turned to Ramillis, head of Maintenance. \"Do we need  spare parts? Or just general repairs?\"    \"Just repairs, sir. We have plenty of shielding metal. It's a long job  to get through the hulls, but there's nothing we can't fix.\"    Vorongil flexed his clawed hands nervously, stretching and retracting  them. \"Ringg, you're the fatigue expert. I'll take your word for it. Can  we make thirty hours?\"    Ringg looked pale and there was none of his usual boyish nonsense when  he said, \"Captain, I swear I wouldn't risk Cottman. You know what  crystallization's like, sir. We can't get through that hull lining to  repair it in space, if it _does_ go before we land. We wouldn't have the  chance of a hydrogen atom in a tank of halogens.\"    Vorongil's slanted eyebrows made a single unbroken line. \"That's the  word then. Bartol, find us the closest star with a planet--spaceport or  not.\"    Bart's hands were shaking with sudden fear. He checked each digit of  their present position, fed it into the computer, waited, finally wet  his lips and plunged, taking the strip from a computer.    \"This small star, called Meristem. It's a--\" he bit his lip, hard; he  had almost said _green_--\"type Q, two planets with atmosphere within  tolerable limits, not classified as inhabited.\"    \"Who owns it?\"    \"I don't have that information on the banks, sir.\"    Vorongil beckoned the Mentorian assistant. So apart were Lhari and  Mentorian on these ships that Bart did not even know his name. He said,  \"Look up a star called Meristem for us.\" The Mentorian hurried away,  came back after a moment with the information that it belonged to the  Second Galaxy Federation, but was listed as unexplored.    Vorongil scowled. \"Well, we can claim necessity,\" he said. \"It's only  eight hours away, and Cottman's thirty. Bartol, plot us a warp-drive  shift that will land us in that system, and on the inner of the two  planets, within nine hours. If it's a type Q star, that means dim  illumination, and no spaceport mercury-vapor installations. We'll need  as much sunlight as we can get.\"    It was the first time that Bart, unaided, had had the responsibility of  plotting a warp-drive shift. He checked the coordinates of the small  green star three times before passing them along to Vorongil. Even so,  when they went into Acceleration Two, he felt stinging fear. _If I  plotted wrong, we could shift into that crazy space and come out  billions of miles away...._    But when the stars steadied and took on their own colors, the blaze of a  small green sun was steady in the viewport.    \"Meristem,\" Vorongil said, taking the controls himself. \"Let's hope the  place is really uninhabited and that catalogue's up to date, lads. It  wouldn't be any fun to burn up some harmless village, or get shot at by  barbarians--and we're setting down with no control-tower signals and no  spaceport repair crews. So let's hope our luck holds out for a while  yet.\"    Bart, feeling the minute, unsteady trembling somewhere in the  ship--_Imagination_, he told himself, _you can't feel metal-fatigue  somewhere in the hull lining_--echoed the wish. He did not know that he  had already had the best luck of his unique voyage, or realize the  fantastic luck that had brought him to the small green star Meristem.          CHAPTER NINE      The crews of repairmen were working down in the hull, and the  _Swiftwing_ was a hell of clanging noise and shuddering heat.  Maintenance was working overtime, but the rest of the crew, with nothing  to do, stood around in the recreation rooms, tried to play games, cursed  the heat and the dreary dimness through the viewports, and twitched at  the boiler-factory racket from the holds.
