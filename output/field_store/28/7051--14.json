Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet,  stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts.  What do  you make of all this?\"    \"A savage!\" I exclaimed.  \"Perhaps one of those Indians who were the  associates of Jonathan Small.\"    \"Hardly that,\" said he.  \"When first I saw signs of strange weapons I  was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks  caused me to reconsider my views.  Some of the inhabitants of the  Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as  that.  The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet.  The sandal-wearing  Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because  the thong is commonly passed between.  These little darts, too, could  only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe.  Now, then, where  are we to find our savage?\"    \"South American,\" I hazarded.    He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.  \"This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published.  It may be looked upon as the very latest authority.  What have we here?  'Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the  Bay of Bengal.'  Hum! hum! What's all this?  Moist climate, coral  reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island,  cottonwoods--Ah, here we are. 'The aborigines of the Andaman Islands  may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this  earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the  Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians.  The average  height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may  be found who are very much smaller than this.  They are a fierce,  morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted  friendships when their confidence has once been gained.'  Mark that,  Watson.  Now, then, listen to this.  'They are naturally hideous,  having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted  features.  Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small.  So  intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British  official have failed to win them over in any degree.  They have always  been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their  stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows.  These  massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.'  Nice, amiable  people, Watson!  If this fellow had been left to his own unaided  devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn.  I  fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to  have employed him.\"    \"But how came he to have so singular a companion?\"    \"Ah, that is more than I can tell.  Since, however, we had already  determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very  wonderful that this islander should be with him.  No doubt we shall  know all about it in time.  Look here, Watson; you look regularly done.  Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\"    He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he  began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his own, no doubt, for  he had a remarkable gift for improvisation.  I have a vague remembrance  of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow.  Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound,  until I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan  looking down upon me.        Chapter IX    A Break in the Chain    It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed.  Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had  laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me,  as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.    \"You have slept soundly,\" he said.  \"I feared that our talk would wake  you.\"    \"I heard nothing,\" I answered.  \"Have you had fresh news, then?\"    \"Unfortunately, no.  I confess that I am surprised and disappointed.  I  expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to  report.  He says that no trace can be found of the launch.  It is a  provoking check, for every hour is of importance.\"    \"Can I do anything?  I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for  another night's outing.\"    \"No, we can do nothing.  We can only wait.  If we go ourselves, the  message might come in our absence, and delay be caused.  You can do  what you will, but I must remain on guard.\"    \"Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil  Forrester.  She asked me to, yesterday.\"    \"On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in  his eyes.    \"Well, of course Miss Morstan too.  They were anxious to hear what  happened.\"    \"I would not tell them too much,\" said Holmes.  \"Women are never to be  entirely trusted,--not the best of them.\"    I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment.  \"I shall be  back in an hour or two,\" I remarked.    \"All right!  Good luck!  But, I say, if you are crossing the river you  may as well return Toby, for I don't think it is at all likely that we  shall have any use for him now.\"    I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a  half-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane.  At Camberwell  I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but  very eager to hear the news.  Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of  curiosity.  I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the  more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr.  Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.  With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze  them.    \"It is a romance!\" cried Mrs. Forrester.  \"An injured lady, half a  million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian.  They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\"    \"And two knight-errants to the rescue,\" added Miss Morstan, with a  bright glance at me.    \"Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don't  think that you are nearly excited enough.  Just imagine what it must be  to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\"    It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no  sign of elation at the prospect.  On the contrary, she gave a toss of  her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small  interest.    \"It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\" she said. \"Nothing  else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly  and honorably throughout.  It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful  and unfounded charge.\"    It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I  reached home.  My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he  had disappeared.  I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but  there was none.    \"I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\" I said to Mrs.  Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.    \"No, sir.  He has gone to his room, sir.  Do you know, sir,\" sinking  her voice into an impressive whisper, \"I am afraid for his health?\"    \"Why so, Mrs. Hudson?\"    \"Well, he's that strange, sir.  After you was gone he walked and he  walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of  his footstep.  Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and  every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with 'What is  that, Mrs. Hudson?'  And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can  hear him walking away the same as ever.  I hope he's not going to be  ill, sir.  I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine,  but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how ever I  got out of the room.\"    \"I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\" I  answered.  \"I have seen him like this before.  He has some small matter  upon his mind which makes him restless.\"  I tried to speak lightly to  our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the  long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread,  and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary  inaction.    At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of  feverish color upon either cheek.    \"You are knocking yourself up, old man,\" I remarked.  \"I heard you  marching about in the night.\"    \"No, I could not sleep,\" he answered.  \"This infernal problem is  consuming me.  It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle,  when all else had been overcome.  I know the men, the launch,  everything; and yet I can get no news.  I have set other agencies at  work, and used every means at my disposal.  The whole river has been  searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard  of her husband.  I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have  scuttled the craft.  But there are objections to that.\"    \"Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\"    \"No, I think that may be dismissed.  I had inquiries made, and there is  a launch of that description.\"    \"Could it have gone up the river?\"    \"I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party  who will work up as far as Richmond.  If no news comes to-day, I shall  start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat.  But surely, surely, we shall hear something.\"    We did not, however.  Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from  the other agencies.  There were articles in most of the papers upon the  Norwood tragedy.  They all appeared to be rather hostile to the  unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto.  No fresh details were to be found,  however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the  following day.  I walked over to Camberwell in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#14)"],[1,"River, and  from thence round to Mafeking. Personally, I believe that the totals  were larger, for very considerable numbers of the Dutch population in  Cape Colony and Natal joined the Boers, and the indications are that  all the available men were put--and very properly--at once in the  field. The emergency was great, time was invaluable, and the  maintaining of a reserve, judicious in many cases, would under the  conditions of the Boers have been a mere dividing and frittering of  forces, by the immediate employment of which alone might success be  snatched.                       [Footnote 9: May 19, 1900.]    To allow Great Britain time to arouse, to assemble and put forth her  strength, before some really decisive advantage, material or moral,  {p.117} was gained over her, was to ensure defeat. This, however, was  what the Boers did. Although they put in force successfully a _levee  en masse_, and thus in point of time concentrated into action their  whole fighting population, they did not with equal exclusiveness of  purpose concentrate in force upon a single military objective; nor was  such choice as they made dictated by sound military principle, or  carried out with sound military judgment.    It so happened that the conditions at the opening of the campaign bore  a curious resemblance, though on a considerably larger scale, to those  attending the hostilities of 1881 in South Africa. Then, as now, the  British were in number far inferior. Then, as now, they were scattered  here and there in small detachments. Then the Boers had achieved  successes which doubtless surprised themselves as well as their  enemies, and had produced for them the unfortunate result of  overvaluing their own prowess, and of inducing a secure belief that  both they and their opponents, after twenty years, remained in native  and acquired qualities in the same relative {p.118} positions of  individual superiority and inferiority that they had somewhat  prematurely assumed.    It was a natural result of such prepossessions that, instead of  concentrating to hold in mass some decisive position by which to  prolong the war, or to destroy or capture some important  detachment--such as that at Ladysmith--they should settle themselves  down to sieges, to a war of posts. In 1881, of several posts they had  in the same manner leisurely invested, one surrendered. They probably  believed that the others would have done so, had not the British  Government of that day yielded and made peace. Whatever the reasoning,  it was to the method of 1881 that the Boers resorted. After the  preliminary battles in Natal, already narrated, in each of which the  British attacked, they settled down with facile indolence to an  investment of Ladysmith.    The dissemination of the enemy on the Free State frontier, so  graphically summarized by Steevens, could not induce them to crush,  with the concentrated force permitted by their imposing superiority of  numbers, any one {p.119} of the small detachments thus fatally  exposed. The place, not the force within, had military value in their  eyes. To the general result contributed no doubt the tendency of local  interest to dominate general considerations in a rural and loosely  organised population. It was noted at the time that the principle of  local operation decided not only that the Transvaal should operate  chiefly in Natal, and the Orange Free State toward Cape Colony, but  also determined the course of action within each state. \"There has  been very little moving about of burghers from one part of the  Transvaal or Free State to the other.... In the latter, the eastern  commandos have gone to Natal, the western ones to Kimberley, and to  the southern ones, numbering probably less than 4,000 men altogether,  have been left the double task of invading Cape Colony and keeping off  the Basutos; and as the ordinary Free State burgher is much more  anxious about his own farm than about turning our colony upside down,  the result is that practically nothing has been done to attack the  most vulnerable point in our defence.\"    The {p.120} same correspondent, writing from Cape Town, October 25,  said that there were not 3,000 men of regular troops, and no  artillery, in Cape Colony when the war broke out. His means of  information were doubtless better than those of Steevens, who was in  Cape Town less than forty-eight hours and made his guess--4,100--before  he had time for personal observation over the ground.    It is scarcely necessary to point out what an opportunity was here  presented for a rapid succession of blows at isolated detachments,  such as military history has often before witnessed. It is difficult  to believe that the frontier could not have been swept clean from end  to end, and the entire railroad system, essential to the advance and  centralised action of the British forces, hopelessly dislocated and  smashed by an operation embodying the most elementary conceptions of  concentration. Instead of that the centre of the line was kept almost  undisturbed, the principal demonstrations of the Boers across the  border being on the flanks--Kimberley and Mafeking on their right,  Stormberg and the {p.121} districts north and east of it on their  left; the railroad from Naauwport to De Aar, and thence to the Orange  River, being scarcely molested, and for working purposes remaining  intact. So far as military purpose can be inferred from military  action, the effort of the Boers was concentrated--or rather  localised--upon the occupation of unprotected and friendly districts  in the east, where they took up scattered defensive positions, while  for offensive operations they satisfied themselves with the investment  of Kimberley and Mafeking.    An American correspondent--evidently not unfriendly--writing of  Pretoria about October 20, records an instructive anecdote, which  reveals much of the Boer idea and purpose, and suggests food for  thought as to underlying causes, not unprecedented in history, which  from the first, if then known, would have foretold sure defeat. \"A  large door on the opposite side of the room opened, and a clerk  informed the Secretary (Mr. Reitz) that he was wanted in the Executive  Council room. While he was collecting a number of papers on his desk I  could hear the conversation of {p.122} men in the adjoining room.  Suddenly there was a deep roar--almost like that of a lion--and at the  same time a bang on the table that made the windows rattle. And the  voice--it was that of a man--continued its deep bellowing, and again  there was a thundering bang on the table. 'The old President has met  with some obstacle in his plans,' said the Secretary of State, smiling  at my look of surprise at the sound of such a human voice, and he  disappeared with an armload of papers.... When he returned he was  chuckling to himself. 'General Cronje wants to assault Mafeking,' he  said. 'He has wired that he can take the town in a hand-to-hand fight,  but the old President won't listen to it. He says the place is not  worth the lives of fifty burghers, and has just issued an order that  Cronje is to continue the siege and simply see to it that Colonel  Baden-Powell and his troops do not escape. The Council was divided;  some thought that Cronje should be permitted to storm the place. The  President has just ordered that one of the big siege-guns shall be  sent to Cronje.'\"[10]                       [Footnote 10: _Harper's Monthly Magazine_, May,                     1900, p. 827.]    Time {p.123} apparently was of no account. The burghers and the Boers  had only to wait open-mouthed for plums to drop--at Mafeking, at  Kimberley, at Ladysmith. Mafeking very possibly was not in itself  worth the lives of fifty burghers; but it was worth a great deal more  if it was to be the means of detaining them before its little worth to  their exclusion from action concentrated elsewhere, which their  numbers would have gone to make overpowering, and which by proper  direction would have been decisive--not perhaps of ultimate  issues--but of those prolonged delays in which lies the best hope of a  defence. It is an interesting commentary on Kruger's decision that, at  the moment these lines are writing, the deliverance of Mafeking is  known to have been preceded immediately by a fruitless assault of the  burghers, which cost more than that presumed for the attack at the  outset, which a competent general on the spot believed then would be  successful. Control at a distant capital, exercised by an obstinate,  overbearing old man, who, though unquestionably shrewd and acute, was  equally unquestionably narrow with the narrowness of contracted  experience and {p.124} limited military knowledge, boded ill for the  Boer cause. While Cronje at Mafeking, and Wessels at Kimberley, and  Joubert at Ladysmith were waiting for a moment that never came, time  was flying, the hostile reinforcements were speeding forward 300 miles  a day, and the very danger of the three places was goading the British  people into wide-awake activity.    Yet more imminent was the nearer opportunity, fast disappearing into  the nearer danger, ultimately to become the established and fatal  centre of ruin--at De Aar. \"This was not the sort of fighting-ground  the Boer is wont to choose,\" wrote one there present, \"but we felt  that he must come because we menaced his frontier sixty miles away,  and tempted him with such an amount of stores, guns, and ammunition as  would enable him to prolong his warfare at least two months longer  than his own resources would permit.\" A somewhat narrow view this,  leaving out of the account De Aar's intrinsic advantage in position;  but to continue--\"Every day that the Boers delayed our camp grew  stronger, though this was not the case before General {p.125} Buller  arrived at the Cape (October 31). Until then we had only one  battalion--about 800 men--to protect stores estimated at half a  "]]]
