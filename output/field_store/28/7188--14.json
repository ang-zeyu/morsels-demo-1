[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#14)"],[1,", I have been continually meditating an  escape; but for myself alone it was too difficult. In the inner court  of the castle, you may have observed a fountain, which pours forth  water from ten tubes; this fountain riveted my attention. I remembered  in my father's house to have seen a similar one, the water of which  was led up through a spacious aqueduct. In order to learn whether this  fountain was constructed in the same manner, I one day praised its  magnificence to Thiuli, and inquired after its architect. 'I myself  built it,' answered he, 'and what thou seest here is still the  smallest part; for the water comes hither into it from a brook at  least a thousand paces off, flowing through a vaulted aqueduct, which  is as high as a man. And all this have I myself planned.' After  hearing this, I often wished only for a moment to have a man's  strength, in order to roll away the stone from the side of the  fountain; then could I have fled whither I would. The aqueduct now  will I show to you; through it you can enter the castle by night, and  set them free. Only you must have at least two men with you, in order  to overpower the slaves which, by night, guard the seraglio.\"    Thus she spoke, and my brother Mustapha, although twice disappointed  already in his expectations, once again took courage, and hoped with  Allah's assistance to carry out the plan of the slave. He promised to  conduct her in safety to her native land, if she would assist him in  entering the castle. But one thought still troubled him, namely, where  he could find two or three faithful assistants. Thereupon the dagger  of Orbasan occurred to him, and the promise of the robber to hasten to  his assistance, when he should stand in need of help, and he therefore  started with Fatima from the burying-ground, to seek the chieftain.    In the same city where he had converted himself into a physician,  with his last money he purchased a horse, and procured lodgings for  Fatima, with a poor woman in the suburbs. He, however, hastened  towards the mountain where he had first met Orbasan, and reached it in  three days. He soon found the tent, and unexpectedly walked in before  the chieftain, who welcomed him with friendly courtesy. He related to  him his unsuccessful attempts, whereupon the grave Orbasan could not  restrain himself from laughing a little now and then, particularly  when he announced himself as the physician Chakamankabudibaba. At the  treachery of the little man, however, he was furious; and swore, if he  could find him, to hang him with his own hand. He assured my brother  that he was ready to assist him the moment he should be sufficiently  recovered from his ride. Accordingly, Mustapha remained that night  again in the robber's tent, and with the first morning-red they set  out, Orbasan taking with him three of his bravest men, well mounted  and armed. They rode rapidly, and in two days arrived at the little  city, where Mustapha had left the rescued Fatima. Thence they rode on  with her unto the forest, from which, at a little distance, they could  see Thiuli's castle; there they concealed themselves, to await the  night. As soon as it was dark, guided by Fatima, they proceeded softly  to the brook, where the aqueduct commenced, and soon found it. There  they left Fatima and a servant with the horses, and prepared  themselves for the descent: before they started, however, Fatima once  more repeated, with precision, the directions she had given; namely,  that, on emerging from the fountain into the inner court-yard, they  would find a tower in each corner on the right and left; that inside  the sixth gate from the right tower, they would find Fatima and  Zoraida, guarded by two black slaves. Well provided with weapons and  iron implements for forcing the doors, Mustapha, Orbasan, and the two  other men, descended through the aqueduct; they sank, indeed, in  water, up to the middle, but not the less vigorously on that account  did they press forward.    In a half hour they arrived at the fountain, and immediately began to  ply their tools. The wall was thick and firm, but could not long  resist the united strength of the four men; they soon made a breach  sufficiently large to allow them to slip through without difficulty.  Orbasan was the first to emerge, and then assisted the others. Being  now all in the court-yard, they examined the side of the castle which  lay before them, in order to find the door which had been described.  But they could not agree as to which it was, for on counting from the  right tower to the left, they found one door which had been walled up,  and they knew not whether Fatima had included this in her calculation.  But Orbasan was not long in making up his mind: \"My good sword will  open to me this gate,\" he exclaimed, advancing to the sixth, while the  others followed him. They opened it, and found six black slaves lying  asleep upon the floor; imagining that they had missed the object of  their search, they were already softly drawing back, when a figure  raised itself in the corner, and in well-known accents called for  help. It was the little man of the robber-encampment. But ere the  slaves knew what had taken place, Orbasan sprang upon the little man,  tore his girdle in two, stopped his mouth, and bound his hands behind  his back; then he turned to the slaves, some of whom were already  half bound by Mustapha and the two others, and assisted in completely  overpowering them. They presented their daggers to the breasts of the  slaves, and asked where Nurmahal and Mirza were: they confessed that  they were in the next chamber. Mustapha rushed into the room, and  found Fatima and Zoraida awakened by the noise. They were not long in  collecting their jewels and garments, and following my brother.    Meanwhile the two robbers proposed to Orbasan to carry off what they  could find, but he forbade them, saying: \"It shall never be told of  Orbasan, that he enters houses by night, to steal gold.\" Mustapha, and  those he had preserved, quickly stepped into the aqueduct, whither  Orbasan promised to follow them immediately. As soon as they had  departed, the chieftain and one of the robbers led forth the little  man into the court-yard; there, having fastened around his neck a  silken cord, which they had brought for that purpose, they hung him on  the highest point of the fountain. After having thus punished the  treachery of the wretch, they also entered the aqueduct, and followed  Mustapha. With tears the two maidens thanked their brave preserver,  Orbasan; but he urged them in haste to their flight, for it was very  probable that Thiuli-Kos would seek them in every direction.    With deep emotion, on the next day, did Mustapha and the rescued  maidens part with Orbasan. Indeed, they never will forget him! Fatima,  the freed slave, left us in disguise for Balsora, in order to take  passage thence to her native land.    After a short and agreeable journey, my brother and his companions  reached home. Delight at seeing them once more, almost killed my old  father; the next day after their arrival, he gave a great festival, to  which all the city was invited. Before a large assemblage of relations  and friends, my brother had to relate his story, and with one voice  they praised him and the noble robber.    When, however, Mustapha had finished, my father arose and led Zoraida  to him. \"Thus remove I,\" said he with solemn voice, \"the curse from  thy head; take this maiden as the reward which thy unwearied courage  has merited. Receive my fatherly blessing: and may there never be  wanting to our city, men who, in brotherly love, in prudence, and  bravery, may be thy equals!\"    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *    The Caravan had reached the end of the desert, and gladly did the  travellers salute the green meadows, and thickly-leaved trees, of  whose charms they had been deprived for so many days. In a lovely  valley lay a caravansery, which they selected as their resting-place  for the night; and though it offered but limited accommodations and  refreshment, still was the whole company more happy and sociable than  ever: for the thought of having passed through the dangers and  hardships, with which a journey through the desert is ever  accompanied, had opened every heart, and attuned their minds to jest  and gayety. Muley, the young and merry merchant, went through a comic  dance, and sang songs thereto, which elicited a laugh, even from  Zaleukos, the serious Greek. But not content with having raised the  spirits of his comrades by dance and merriment, he also gave them, in  the best style, the story he had promised, and, as soon as he could  recover breath from his gambols, began the following tale.          [Illustration]    LITTLE MUCK.      In Nicea, my beloved father-city, lived a man, whom people called  \"Little Muck.\" Though at that time I was quite young, I can recollect  him very well, particularly since, on one occasion, I was flogged  almost to death, by my father, on his account. The Little Muck, even  then, when I knew him, an old man, was nevertheless but three or four  feet high: he had a singular figure, for his body, little and smart  as it was, carried a head much larger and thicker than that of others.  He lived all alone in a large house, and even cooked for himself;  moreover, it would not have been known in the city whether he was  alive or dead, (for he went forth but once in four weeks,) had not  every day, about the hour of noon, strong fumes come forth from the  house. Nevertheless, in the evening he was often to be seen walking to  and fro upon his roof; although, from the street, it seemed as if it  were his head alone that was running around there.    I and my comrades were wicked fellows, who teased and ridiculed every  one; accordingly, to us it was a holiday when the Little Muck went  forth: on the appointed day we would assemble before his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#14)"],[1," Scotch commanders,  Lenox and Argyle, both perished, as well as the valiant King James  himself. There is scarcely an illustrious Scotch family who had not an  ancestor slain on that fatal day, September 9, 1513. But the victory  was dearly bought, and Surrey, the English general, afterwards Duke of  Norfolk, was unable to pursue his advantages.    [Sidenote: Rise of Cardinal Wolsey.]    About this time, the celebrated Cardinal Wolsey began to act a  conspicuous part in English affairs. His father was a butcher of  Ipswich; but was able to give his son a good education. He studied at  Oxford, was soon distinguished for his attainments, and became tutor  to the sons of the Marquis of Dorset. The marquis gave him the rich  living of Limington; but the young parson, with his restless ambition,  and love of excitement and pleasure, was soon wearied of a country  life. He left his parish to become domestic chaplain to the treasurer  of Calais. This post introduced him to Fox, bishop of Winchester, who  shared with the Earl of Surrey the highest favors of royalty. The  minister and diplomatist, finding in the young man learning, tact,  vivacity, and talent for business, introduced him to the king, hoping  that he would prove an agreeable companion for Henry, and a useful  tool for himself. But those who are able to manage other people's  business, generally are able to manage their own. The tool of Fox  looked after his own interest chiefly. He supplanted his master in the  loyal favor, and soon acquired more favor and influence at court than  any of the ministers or favorites. Though twenty years older than  Henry, he adapted himself to all his tastes, flattered his vanity and  passions, and became his bosom friend. He gossiped with him about  Thomas Aquinas, the Indies, and affairs of gallantry. He was a great  refiner of sensual pleasures, had a passion for magnificence and  display, and a real genius for court entertainments. He could eat and  drink with the gayest courtiers, sing merry songs, and join in the  dance. He was blunt and frank in his manners; but these only concealed  craft and cunning. \"It is art to conceal art,\" and Wolsey was a master  of all the tricks of dissimulation. He rose rapidly after he had once  gained the heart of the king. He became successively dean of York,  papal legate, cardinal, bishop of Lincoln, archbishop of York, and  lord chancellor. He also obtained the administration and the  temporalities of the rich abbey of St. Albans, and of the bishoprics  of Bath and Wells, Durham and Winchester. By these gifts, his revenues  almost equalled those of the crown; and he squandered them in a style  of unparalleled extravagance. He dressed in purple and gold, supported  a train of eight hundred persons, and built Hampton Court. He was the  channel through which the royal favors flowed. But he made a good  chancellor, dispensed justice, repressed the power of the nobles,  encouraged and rewarded literary men, and endowed colleges. He was the  most magnificent and the most powerful subject that England has ever  seen. Even nobles were proud to join his train of dependants. There  was nothing sordid or vulgar, however, in all his ostentation. Henry  took pleasure in his pomp, for it was a reflection of the greatness of  his own majesty.    [Sidenote: Magnificence of Henry VIII.]    The first years of the reign of Henry VIII., after the battle of  Flodden Field, were spent in pleasure, and in great public displays of  magnificence, which charmed the people, and made him a popular idol.  Among these, the interview of the king with Francis I. is the most  noted, on the 4th of June, 1520; the most gorgeous pageant of the  sixteenth century, designed by Wolsey, who had a genius for such  things. The monarchs met in a beautiful valley, where jousts and  tournaments were held, and where was exhibited all the magnificence  which the united resources of France and England could command. The  interview was sought by Francis to win, through Wolsey, the favor of  the king, and to counterbalance the advantages which it was supposed  Charles V. had gained on a previous visit to the king at Dover.    The getting up of the \"Field of the Cloth of Gold\" created some  murmurs among the English nobility, many of whom were injured by the  expensive tastes of Wolsey. Among these was the Duke of Buckingham,  hereditary high constable of England, and connected with the royal  house of the Plantagenets. Henry, from motives of jealousy, both on  account of his birth and fortune, had long singled him out as his  victim. He was, also, obnoxious to Wolsey, since he would not flatter  his pride, and he had, moreover, insulted him. It is very easy for a  king to find a pretence for committing a crime; and Buckingham was  arrested, tried, and executed, for making traitorous prophecies. His  real crime was in being more powerful than it suited the policy of the  king. With the death of Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, in 1521,  commenced the bloody cruelty of Henry VIII.    Soon after the death of Buckingham, the king made himself notorious  for his theological writings against Luther, whose doctrines he  detested. He ever had a taste for theological disputation, and a love  of the schoolmen. His tracts against Luther, very respectable for  talent and learning, though disgraced by coarse and vulgar  vituperation, secured for him the favor of the pope, who bestowed upon  him the title of \"Defender of the Faith;\" and a strong alliance  existed between them until the divorce of Queen Catharine.    The difficulties and delays, attending this act of cruelty and  injustice, constitute no small part of the domestic history of England  during the reign of Henry VIII. Any event, which furnishes subjects of  universal gossip and discussion, is ever worthy of historical notice,  inasmuch as it shows prevailing opinions and tastes.    Queen Catharine, daughter of Ferdinand, King of Spain, was eight years  older than her husband, whom she married in the first year of his  reign. She had been previously married to his brother Arthur, who died  of the plague in 1502. For several years after her marriage with  Henry VIII., her domestic happiness was a subject of remark; and the  emperor, Charles V., congratulated her on her brilliant fortune. She  was beautiful, sincere, accomplished; religious, and disinterested,  and every way calculated to secure, as she had won, the king's  affections.    [Sidenote: Anne Boleyn.]    But among her maids of honor there was one peculiarly accomplished and  fascinating, to whom the king transferred his affections with unwonted  vehemence. This was Anne Boleyn, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, who,  from his great wealth, married Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the first  duke of Norfolk. This noble alliance brought Sir Thomas Boleyn into  close connection with royalty, and led to the appointment of his  daughter to the high post which she held at the court of Queen  Catharine. It is probable that the king suppressed his passion for  some time; and it would have been longer concealed, even from its  object, had not his jealousy been excited by her attachment to Percy,  son of the Earl of Northumberland. The king at last made known his  passion; but the daughter of the Howards was too proud, or too  politic, or too high principled, to listen to his overtures. It was  only _as queen of England_, that she would return the passion of her  royal lover. Moreover, she resolved to be revenged on the all-powerful  cardinal, for assisting in her separation from Percy, whom she loved  with romantic attachment. The king waited four years, but Anne  remained inflexibly virtuous. He then meditated the divorce from  Catharine, as the only way to accomplish the object which now seemed  to animate his existence. He confided the matter to his favorite  minister; but Wolsey was thunderstruck at the disclosure, and remained  with him four hours on his knees, to dissuade him from a step which  he justly regarded as madness. Here Wolsey appears as an honest man  and a true friend; but royal infatuation knows neither wisdom,  justice, nor humanity. Wolsey, as a man of the world, here made a  blunder, and departed from the policy he had hitherto pursued--that of  flattering the humors of his absolute master. Wolsey, however,  recommended the king to consult the divines; for Henry pretended that,  after nearly twenty years of married life, he had conscientious  scruples about the lawfulness of his marriage. The learned English  doctors were afraid to pronounce their opinions, and suggested a  reference to the fathers. But the king was not content with their  authority; he appealed to the pope, and to the decisions of half of  the universities of Europe. It seems very singular that a sovereign so  unprincipled, unscrupulous, and passionate, and yet so absolute and  powerful as was Henry, should have wasted his time and money in  seeking countenance to an act on which he was fully determined, and  which countenance he never could reasonably hope to secure. But his  character was made up of contradictions. His caprice, violence, and  want of good faith, were strangely blended with superstition and  reverence for the authority of the church. His temper urged him to the  most rigorous measure of injustice; and his injustice produced no  shame, although he was restrained somewhat by the opinions of the very  men whom he did not hesitate to murder.    [Sidenote: Queen Catharine.]    Queen Catharine, besides being a virtuous and excellent woman, was  powerfully allied, and was a zealous Catholic. Her repudiation,  therefore, could not take place without offending the very persons  whose favor the king was most anxious to conciliate especially the  Emperor Charles, her nephew, and the pope, and all the high  dignitaries and adherents of the church. Even Wolsey could not in  honor favor the divorce, although it was his policy to do so. In"]]]
