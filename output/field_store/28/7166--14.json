Now, then, was it a false alarm?\"    \"Well, no; but I should never have taken this chap for a lion,\" replied  his cousin.  \"Here, I say, you, sir, why do you speak as if you were  sorry that my cousin did not hit you?\"    \"Wasn't,\" said the man, mournfully snipping away.    \"Well, what do you want?\"    \"Breakfast,\" said the man.  \"Had none since you come away.\"    \"That's cool,\" said Mark, as he looked at the man suspiciously.  \"Oh,  here come Buck Denham and Dan.  They have smelt that something's wrong  about the ponies.  Here,\" he continued, turning to the two fresh  arrivals, \"what are you two laughing at?\"    \"At 'im, sir,\" whispered Dan, as the oddity moved away after a pony.    \"Yes, he's rather a rum 'un to look at, gen'lemen,\" said Buck, in the  same low tone.  \"I have seen him before.  Sort of hang-about as has to  do with him as sold you those ponies.  I think he's a bit touched in his  head--dotty, you know.\"    \"That's what I think too, gentlemen,\" whispered Dan.  \"I have been to  'Stralia--Sydney, you know, where chaps go out shepherding and don't see  anything but the woolly ones sometimes for three months together, and I  have heard as some of them quite goes off their heads, miserable and  lonely like, for they have nobody to talk to but the sheep.\"    \"But this isn't Australia,\" said Mark.    \"And this fellow hasn't been with sheep,\" added Dean, \"but ponies.\"    \"No, sir,\" said Dan; \"but horses do just as well.\"    \"That they wouldn't,\" cried Mark.  \"A man who had horses with him could  make companions of them.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Dean, \"and have a good long ride every now and then.\"    \"To be sure,\" added Mark.  \"A man who had a horse or a dog for companion  could not go off his head.  Look at Robinson Crusoe; he was jolly enough  with a poll parrot.\"    \"Oh, yes, sir; but then a poll parrot could talk.\"    \"Yes, but he had to teach it first,\" said Dean.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Dan, \"but you couldn't teach a sheep.  Why, if you had  one of them for years you would never get anything out of him but Baa!\"    \"Bah, then, to what you are saying,\" cried Mark.  \"Here, I say, you,  sir,\" he cried, looking in an amused way at their visitor, who had  finished his clipping, pocketed his scissors, and had taken hold of his  moustachios as if they were reins and stroked them down with a twist,  looking dolefully at those about him the while; \"I'll answer for it that  we give you some breakfast, and then you had better be off.\"    The man shook his head.    \"Eh?  What do you mean by that?\" said Mark.    The man shook his head again and took out his scissors as if about to  begin clipping once more, but bethought himself and put them back.    Dan chuckled as if he thought it was very good fun, and Buck bent down  and whispered something in the little fellow's ear.    \"Here, what's that?\" cried Mark sharply.    \"He means he's going to stop to dinner, sir.\"    It was said quite in a whisper, but the man proved that he was keen  enough of ear.    \"That's so,\" he said mournfully, as if the dinner would be a punishment.    \"What, you mean to stay to dinner?\"    The man nodded, paused for a few moments, and then with a heavy sigh--    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, you are a cucumber,\" said Mark, \"upon my word!\"    \"Not in season,\" said the man.    \"Cheek!\" said Dean laughing.    The man looked up sharply.    \"Bacon,\" he said sadly; and there was an explosion of laughter.    \"Bob isn't here; but you are a queer fellow,\" said Mark.    \"Yes,\" said the man; and he looked from one to the other, and sighed  again.    \"Here, I say,\" continued Mark, \"where does it hurt you?\"    \"Hurt me?\" replied the man.    \"Yes.  Inside?  Are you in pain?\"    The man shook his head.    \"My way,\" he said, and he sighed again.    \"Well, don't talk like that.\"    \"Eh?  No,\" said the man; and he reached out his hand to pass it over the  muzzle of one of the ponies that had raised its head from where it had  been cropping the green shoots of a dwarf shrub.    \"The ponies seem to be very good friends with you.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Buck; \"they follow him like dogs.\"    \"Know me,\" said the man sadly.    \"Well, you needn't cry about it,\" said Dean.    \"Oh, that's it,\" cried Mark; \"I see.  Poor chap!  He came to see them  again, to say good-bye.\"    The man shook his head.    \"No,\" he said; \"going with them.\"    \"Oh, are you?\" cried Mark.  \"I am glad you told me.  But somebody else  will have a word or two about that.\"    \"Who?\" said the man.    \"Why, my father.\"    \"But he bought the ponies,\" said the man.    \"Yes,\" cried Mark, \"but he didn't buy you.\"    \"No,\" said the man.  \"Same thing.  I belong to them.\"    \"I say, Dozey,\" cried Mark, \"you are wide awake enough now: did you ever  hear anything like this before.\"    \"Never,\" was the prompt reply.    \"Ponies no good without me,\" said the man.    \"Why?\" cried the boys, in a breath.    \"Won't stop with you.  Run back to the town to look for me,\" he said,  speaking with some animation now.    \"Nonsense!\" cried Mark.  \"We will picket them.\"    The man laughed, and then as Mark tried to frown him down with a very  severe look, he put his hand in his pocket, took out his scissors again,  and put them back after a snip, and then looked round at his four  companions in turn.    \"See here,\" he said, thrusting two of his fingers into his mouth as he  turned sharply away and started off, going swiftly over the ground and  leaping almost like an antelope over every bush that came in his way,  while he gave vent to a shrill whistle, which he modulated from time to  time.    At the first note the ponies raised their heads from where they were  cropping the sedge, and at the second, one of the sturdy little fellows  uttered a shrill neigh, while at the third note, which turned into a  trill, the little animals dashed off at a canter, scattering the sandy  earth behind them as they tore after the utterer of the cheery sounds.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    MAKING A FORELOPER.    Dean's jaw fell, and he stood staring after the strange visitor with so  vacant an expression of countenance that in spite of his annoyance Mark  burst into a hearty laugh.    \"What are you grinning at?\" cried Dean angrily.    \"Your phiz.  Why, whatever does that fellow call himself?\"    \"A horse stealer!\" cried Dean excitedly.  \"That's what he meant by  coming last night.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Mark.  \"Come on and fetch them back.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said Buck; \"but how?  You'd want a rifle to fetch him  down.\"    \"Hullo!  What does this mean?\" cried Sir James, as he joined them, with  the doctor.  \"Why are the ponies being driven away?\"    \"That fellow!\" cried Mark wildly.  \"A thief, father!\"    \"To be sure,\" said Sir James.  \"But this is a trick.  We have been  imposed upon.\"    \"Yes, father.  This is the chap that crawled up in the dark, and I took  for a lion.  He's a horse stealer.\"    \"Well, the law will soon set that right.\"    \"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"but it means a long tramp back to the town.\"    \"Say, Dan, old chap, this 'ere's a rum game,\" whispered Buck.  \"What do  you think of it?\"    \"Think I should like to get hold of that long-legged 'un.  I'd make him  sing to a different tune instead of giving us another specimen of his  whistlin'.\"    By this time the ponies were far down the track, headed by their strange  visitor, whom the boys had fully expected from moment to moment to see  leap upon one of his companion's backs.    \"Well,\" said Mark, \"this is getting up for a refresher before  breakfast!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Buck.  \"It's about spoilt mine.  Why didn't you bring  him down last night, Mr Mark?  I am sure he desarved it.\"    \"No, he didn't,\" cried the lad addressed.  \"Look at that!  I say,  father, hooray!  He's come back.\"    The boy was quite right, for it was plain enough now, distant as the  objects were, to see in the clear bright morning their nocturnal visitor  describe a curve upon the open country side and, slackening his pace,  begin trotting back, the little drove of ponies dropping from their  canter into a steady trot, coming nearer and nearer till their leader  brought them to where the party had camped for the night; and here they  drew up short and began to crop the tender green shoots again, while the  strange visitor, who did not seem in the slightest degree out of breath,  drew his long pendent moustachios through his hands.    \"Well, sir,\" said Sir James sharply, \"pray, what does this mean?\"    \"Mean?\" said the man sadly.  \"Ponies--know me.\"    \"So it seems,\" said Sir James; \"but I've bought them.\"    \"Yes,\" said the man, in his most melancholy tone.    \"Well, what were you going to say by way of explanation?\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"Well, what do you want?\"    \"Breakfast.\"    \"That's what he said before,\" cried Dean.    \"Hungry,\" said the man, quite reproachfully.    The doctor laughed, and the rest joined in chorus, Dan beginning to  stamp about in the exuberance of his delight.    \"Beg pardon, gentleman,\" he said, checking himself suddenly, \"but he do  set me off.\"    \"But the worst of it is, my man,\" said the doctor, \"that this is  resolving itself into no laughing matter.\"    \"No, sir,\" said Buck respectfully.  \"There's more cry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#14)"],[1,", and that its owners do the hauling, Dorcas Chatham could  not have been much more surprised than at this unlooked-for speech from  her humble suitor.    Up to now, Link Ferris had treated the girl as though he were unworthy  to breathe the same air as herself. He had been pathetically eager to  concede any and every mooted point to her, with a servile abasement  which had roused her contempt, even while it had gratified her sense of  power.    She had approached with tact the subject of Chum's disposal. But she  had done so with a view to the saving of Link's feelings, not with the  faintest idea that her love-bemused slave could venture to oppose her.  She knew his fondness for the dog and she had not wished to bring  matters to an issue, if tact would serve as well.    To punish her serf and to crush rebellion once and for all, as well as  to be avenged for her wasted diplomacy, Dorcas cast aside her kindlier  intent and drove straight to the point. Her calm temper was ruffled,  and she spoke with a new heat:    \"There is something you and I may as well settle, here and now, Link,\"  she said. \"It will save bickerings and misunderstandings, later on.  I've told you how I hate dogs. They are savage and treacherous and--\"    \"Chum ain't!\" declared Link stoutly.    \"Why, that dog--\"    \"I hate dogs,\" she went on, \"and I'm horribly afraid of them. I won't  live in the same house with one. I don't want to hurt your feelings,  Link, but you'll have to get rid of that great brown brute before you  marry me. That is positive. So please let's say no more about it.\"    The man was staring at her with under jaw ajar. Her sharp air of  finality grated on his every nerve. Her ultimatum concerning Chum left  him dumfounded. But he forced himself to rally to the defense.    This glorious sweetheart of his did not understand dogs. He had hoped  to teach her later to like and appreciate them. But apparently she must  be taught at once that Chum could not be sold and that the collie must  remain an honored member of the Ferris household. Marshaling his facts  and his words, he said:    \"I never told you about the time I was coming back home one night from  the tavern here at Hampton, after I'd just cashed my pay check from the  Pat'son market. I've never blabbed much about it, because I was drunk.  Yes, it was back in them days. Just after I'd got Chum. A couple of  fellers had got me drunk. And they set on me in a lonesome patch of the  road by the lake; and they had me down and was taking the money away  from me, when Chum sailed into them and druv them off. He had follered  me, without me knowing. In the scrimmage I got tumbled headfirst into  the lake. I was too drunk to get out, and my head was stuck in the mud,  'way under water. I'd 'a' drowned if Chum hadn't of pulled me out with  his teeth in the shoulder of my coat. And that's the dog you're wanting  me to sell?\"    \"You aren't likely to need such help again, I hope,\" countered the girl  loftily, \"now that you have stopped drinking and made a man of  yourself. So Chum won't be needed for--\"    \"I stopped drinking,\" answered Link, \"because I got to seeing how much  more of a beast I was than the fine clean dog that was living with me.  He made me feel 'shamed of myself. And he was such good comp'ny round  the house that I didn't get lonesome enough to sneak down to the tavern  all the time. It wasn't me that 'made a man of myself.' It was Chum  made a man of me. Maybe that sounds foolish to you. But--\"    \"It does,\" said Dorcas serenely. \"Very foolish indeed. You don't seem  to realize that a dog is only an animal. If you can get a nice home for  the collie--such as John Iglehart will give him--\"    \"Iglehart!\" raged Link, momentarily losing hold over himself. \"If that  mangy, wall-eyed slob comes slinking round my farm again, making  friends with Chum, I'll sick the dog onto him; and have him run  Iglehart all the way to his own shack! He's--! There! I didn't mean to  cut loose like that!\" he broke off at Dorcas's shudder of dismay. \"Only  it riles me something terrible to have him trying to get Chum away from  me.\"    \"There is no occasion to go losing your temper and shouting,\" reproved  the girl. \"Nothing is to be gained that way. Besides, that isn't the  point. The point is this, since you force me to say it: You must get  rid of that dog. And you must do it before you marry me. I won't set  foot in your house until your dog is gone--and gone for good. I am  sorry to speak so, but it had to be said.\"    She paused to give her slave a chance to wilt. But Link only sat,  blank-faced, staring at her. His mind was in a muddle. All his narrow  world was upside down. He couldn't make his brain grasp in full the  situation.    All he could visualize for the instant was a shadowy mental image of  Chum's expectant face; the tulip ears pricked forward, expectant; the  jaws \"laughing\"; the deepset brown eyes abrim with gay affection and  deathless loyalty for the man who was now asked to get rid of him. It  didn't make sense. Half under his breath Link Ferris began to talk--or  rather to ramble.    \"There was one of the books over to the lib'ry,\" he heard himself  meandering on, \"with a queer story in it. I got to reading it through,  one night last winter. It was about a feller named 'Fed'rigo.' A wop of  some kind, I guess. He got so hard up he didn't have anything left but  a pet falcon. Whatever a falcon may be. Whatever it  was, it must'a  been good to eat. But he set a heap of store by it. Him and it was  chums. Same as me and Chum are. Then along come a lady he was in love  with. And she stopped to his house for dinner. There wasn't anything in  the house fit for her to eat. So he fed her the falcon. Killed the pet  that was his chum, so's he could feed the dame he was stuck on. I  thought, when I read it, that that feller was more kinds of a swine  than I'd have time to tell you. But he wasn't any worse'n I'd be if I  was to--\"    \"I'm sorry you care so little for me,\" intervened Dorcas, her voice  very sweet and very cold, and her slender nose whitening a little at  the corners of the nostrils. \"Of course if you prefer a miserable dog  to me, there's nothing more to be said. I--\"    \"No!\" almost yelled the miserable man. \"You've got me all wrong,  dearie. Honest,  you have. Can't you understand? Your little finger  means a heap more to me than ev'rything else there is--except the rest  of you--\"    \"And your dog,\" she supplemented.    \"No!\" he denied fiercely. \"You got no right to say that! But Chum's  served me faithful. And I can't kick him out like he was a--\"    \"Now you are getting angry again!\" she accused, pale and furious. \"I  don't care to be howled at. The case stands like this: You must choose  whether to get rid of that dog or to lose me. Take your choice. If--\"    \"I read in a story book about a feller that had a thing like that put  up to him,\" said poor Link, unable to believe she was in earnest. \"His  girl said: 'You gotta choose between me and tobacco.' And he said:  'I'll choose tobacco. Not that I value tobacco so all-fired much,' he  says, 'but because a girl, who'd make a man take such a choice, ain't  worth giving up tobacco for.' You see, dearie, it's this way--\"    \"You'll have that dog out of your house and out of your possession,  inside of twenty-four hours,\" she decreed, the white anger of a  grave-eyed woman making her cold voice vibrate, \"or you will drop my  acquaintance. That is final. And it's definite. The engagement is  over--until I hear that your dog is killed or given away or sold. Good  night!\"    She left the room in vindictive haste. So overwhelmingly angry was she  that she closed the door softly behind her, instead of slamming it.  Through all his swirl of misery Link had sense enough to note this  final symptom and wonder bitterly at it.    On his way out of the house he was hailed by a highpitched baby voice  from somewhere above him. Olive had crawled out of bed, and in her  white flannel pajamas she was leaning over the upper balustrade.    \"Link!\" she called down to the wretched man at the front door. \"When  you and Dorcas gets married together, I'm comin' to live wiv you! Then  I can play wiv Chummie all I want to!\"    Link bolted out to the street in the midst of her announcement. And, so  occupied was he in trying to swallow a lump in his own throat, he  failed to hear the sound of stifled sobbing from behind a locked door  somewhere in the upper reaches of the house.    As the night wore on, the sleepless girl sought to comfort herself in  the thought that Link had not definitely refused her terms. A night's  reflection and an attitude of unbending aloofness on her own part might  well bring him to a surrender.    Perhaps it was something in Link Ferris's dejected gait, as he turned  into his own lane that night, perhaps it was the instinct which tells a  collie when a loved human is unhappy--but Chum was at once aware of his  master's woe. The dog, at first sound of Link's approaching steps,  bounded from his vigil place on the porch and frisked joyously through  the darkness to meet him. He sent forth a trumpeting bark of welcome as  he ran.    Then--fifty feet from the oncoming man--the big collie halted and stood  for an instant with ears cocked and eyes troubled. After which he  resumed his advance; but at a solemn trot and with downcast mien. As he  reached Link, the collie whined softly under his breath, gazing  wistfully up into Ferris's face and then thrusting his cold nose  lovingly into one of the man's loose-hanging hands.    Link had winced visibly at sound of the jubilantly welcoming bark. Now,  noting the sudden change in the collie's demeanor, he stooped and  caught the silken head between his hands. The gesture was rough, almost  painful. Yet Chum knew it was a caress. And his drooping plume of a  tail began to wag in response.    \"Oh, CHUM!\" exclaimed the man with something akin to a groan. \"Y"]]]
