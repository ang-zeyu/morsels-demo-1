Smith's idea was a good deal more moderate.  \"I don't see that we can  stick out for more than leave to talk when we are not in class, and do  away with `detentions.'\"    \"That really seems hardly worth all the trouble,\" said Hawkesbury, \"does  it?\"    \"It's left to the captain,\" said Smith, shortly, \"and that's my idea, if  you agree.\"    \"We ought to bargain they don't take any more notice of this affair, or  write home about it,\" suggested Shankley.    \"Who cares what they write home?\" scornfully inquired Smith.    \"Ah, it may not matter to _you_,\" said Hawkesbury, smiling very sweetly,  \"but to all the rest of us it does.\"    Smith glared at the speaker, and looked as if he was about to fly at his  throat; but he controlled himself, and merely replied, \"Very well, then,  they are to promise not to say anything about it at home, as well as  give in on the other things.  Is that settled?\"    Everybody said \"yes,\" and shortly afterwards most of the mutineers were  peacefully asleep.    \"Fred,\" said Smith to me that night, as we kept watch together, \"unless  that fellow Hawkesbury lets me alone I shall give the thing up.\"    \"Don't do that,\" said I.  \"Really, I don't think that Hawkesbury means  it.  I'll speak to him if you like.\"  It cost me a great effort to say  this.    Smith fired up unwontedly at the suggestion.    \"If you do, you and I will never be friends again,\" he said,  passionately.  Then recovering himself, he added, repentantly, \"Fred,  I'm awfully sorry I lost my temper.  I know I'm a brute; but please  don't think of speaking to any one about it.\"    \"All right, old man,\" said I.    And so the night wore on, and when presently it came to be our turn to  lie down and sleep in the big bed, I, at any rate, did so a good deal  disturbed in my spirit, and not altogether sure whether in our present  escapade we Stonebridge House boys were not making rather fools of  ourselves.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    HOW THE REBELLION COLLAPSED, AND WE LEFT STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.    I was roused next morning early by the sound of voices, and found that a  fresh council of war was being held in the big bed on the question of  the ultimatum.  Smith was away at the time.    \"I mean to say,\" said Rathbone, \"Smith's far too mild to suit me.\"    I felt called upon to stick up for my chum.    \"Why did you make him captain?\"  I said.  I had long got past the stage  of being afraid either of Rathbone or Philpot at Stonebridge House.    \"Well,\" retorted the malcontent, \"why doesn't he go the whole hog?\"    \"Depends on what you call the whole hog,\" I replied.    \"Why, instead of feeding them up like fighting-cocks I'd starve them--I  would.  And I'd have locked them all together in an empty garret, and  not in rooms with sofas and beds and all that nonsense.  And I wouldn't  let them out till they came out on their knees and promised to do  whatever they were ordered.  That's what I'd do, and I'll tell--\"    \"Now then, Rathbone,\" cried Smith, entering at that moment, \"it's your  turn to look after the grub, remember.  Look alive, or we shall have no  breakfast.\"    It was a curious indication of the power that was in my friend Smith,  that Rathbone--though the words of mutiny were even then on his lips--  quietly got up and went off to his allotted duties without saying a  word.    \"Look here,\" said Smith, presently, pulling two papers from his pocket,  \"I've written out the terms we agreed to.  How will this do?    \"`To Mr Ladislaw, Miss Henniker, and Mr Hashford,--We, the undersigned  boys of Stonebridge House, are willing to release you on the following  conditions:    \"`1.  That leave be given to the boys to talk to one another when not in  class.    \"`2.  That detention for bad marks given by Miss Henniker be abolished.    \"`3.  That you say nothing to any one about all this.    \"`As long as you stick to these conditions, and Miss Henniker doesn't  plague us, we agree to be steady and not mutiny any more.'  That's about  all we need say, isn't it?\"    \"I don't see,\" said Philpot, \"the use of the last clause.  We don't want  to bind ourselves down.\"    \"There's no harm, though, in saying we won't kick up a row if they treat  us properly.\"    \"I don't know,\" said Philpot, doubtfully.  \"I don't want to sign away my  right to kick up a row.\"    We laughed at this ingenuous admission, and Smith said, \"Well, I think  we've a better chance of bringing them to book if we keep it in.  What  do you say, Flanagan?\"    \"Oh yes, keep it in.  You know I like rows as well as anybody, but  what's the use of them when there's nothing to make them about?\"    \"I think it had better stay in,\" said I.  \"What do you say, Hawkesbury?\"    Hawkesbury smiled in an amused way, as if it was a joke.    This appeared to incense Smith greatly, as usual.    \"Why ever don't you say what you think instead of grinning?\" he blurted  out.    \"Why, you know, my dear fellow, we leave it all to you.  I agree to  anything!\"    I verily believe if Smith had had a boot in his hand it would have found  its way in the direction of his enemy's smile.  Happily he hadn't; so he  turned his back on the speaker, and proceeded, \"Very well, then we'd  better sign these at once.  I've got a pen and ink here.  Look sharp,  you fellows.\"    \"Don't you think,\" said Hawkesbury, blandly, once more, \"as it's all  been left to the captain, he had better sign the paper in the name of  the school?  You don't mind, Smith, I'm sure?\"    Smith snatched up the pen hastily, and signed his name at the foot of  each document.    \"I'm not afraid, if that's what you mean.\"    I could watch the working of his face as he hurriedly folded each paper  up into the form of a note, and knew the storm that was going on in his  own breast.  Certainly Hawkesbury, however good his intentions, was a  little aggravating.    \"Perhaps you'll throw that in over the Henniker's door?\" said Smith,  handing one of the notes to Hawkesbury.    Again Hawkesbury smiled as he replied, \"Really, I'm such a bad shot; I'd  much rather you did it.\"    \"Give it me,\" I cried, interposing before my friend could retort.  \"I'll  throw it in.\"    Saying which I took the missive, and after one or two bad shots,  succeeded in getting it through the ventilator and hearing it drop in  the middle of the Henniker's floor.    \"A letter for you,\" I cried by way of explanation.  \"You've an hour to  give an answer.\"    \"Batchelor,\" replied Miss Henniker from within, in what seemed rather a  subdued voice, \"you are doing very wrong.  Let me out immediately,  Batchelor.\"    \"Not till you promise what's written in the note,\" replied I, quitting  the place.    A similar ceremony was enacted by Smith in delivering the \"ultimatum\" to  the two masters, and we then adjourned for breakfast.    \"What shall we do to-day?\" asked Flanagan, who was quite fresh again  after yesterday's hard work.    \"Oh, any mortal thing you like,\" said Shankley.  \"I mean to go and have  a rare walk over the roof.\"    \"I vote we make up a party and go down to the village,\" said another.    \"No, no,\" said Smith, looking up, \"we must stay indoors, or the thing  will soon get known.  You can do anything you like indoors.\"    There was a little growling at this, although we knew there was reason  in the prohibition.    \"I don't see any harm in going out on the heath,\" said Rathbone; \"you  did that yourself once.\"    \"Yes, and some one saw me do it,\" replied Smith.  \"I say, stay in  doors.\"    His tone was peremptory, and as usual it had its due effect.  The  fellows ate their breakfast quietly and said no more about it.    The meal was rather a protracted one, owing to Rathbone having forgotten  to put the bag in the coffee-pot before he inserted the coffee, and thus  spoiling the beverage altogether.  He was sent back to make it over  again--a circumstance which by no means had the effect of soothing his  spirits.    By the time breakfast was done the hour had nearly arrived when our  prisoners were to give their answers to our manifesto.    As we were preparing to march up stairs, with a view to ascertain their  decision, Hawkesbury met us, coming down with his hat on.    \"Where are you going?\" demanded Smith.    Hawkesbury looked very pleasant indeed as he replied, \"Oh, please don't  mind me.  I'm going out for a walk.  I've got a headache, and really I  don't see much use playing about indoors.\"    Smith's face darkened.  \"Didn't you hear me say there was no going out?\"  he said.    Hawkesbury smiled and seemed much amused.  Smith's wrath was rising  apace.  \"What I said I'll stick to!\" cried he, standing across the step.  \"You sha'n't go out!\"    \"Hawkesbury,\" I interposed, anxious to avert a row, \"we've all promised  to obey the captain, you know.\"    \"Really,\" replied Hawkesbury, \"I didn't.  Please let me pass, Smith.\"    \"Then you were speaking false,\" exclaimed the irate Smith, \"when you  said you did promise?\"    \"Really, Smith, I didn't say I did promise--\"    \"Wretched liar!\" replied Smith.    \"That's not a nice name to call a fellow,\" mildly replied Hawkesbury.  \"I hope I'm a gentleman, and don't deserve it.\"    \"Bah,\" said Smith, in tones of utter disgust, standing aside and letting  his enemy pass.  \"Go where you like, we want no sneaks here!\"    Hawkesbury walked on, smiling pleasantly.    \"Good-bye for the present,\" said he.  \"Mind you obey your captain, you  fellows.  We all know _he's_ a gentleman, don't we?\"    And he went out, leaving us all in a state of utter astonishment.    A babel of voices at once arose.  Some declared Hawkesbury was quite  right not to stand being ordered about; others said he ought to have  been stopped going out, and others said, \"Who cared if he did go?\"    In the midst of this my eyes turned to Jack Smith.  His face, which had  been flushed and excited, was now pale and solemn.  He either did not  hear or did not heed the discussion that was going on; and I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#14)"],[1,"the lions for them  with the greatest of pleasure.  We'll outspan at once and set about the  business forthwith.  That will be the right thing to do, I suppose,  Dick, won't it?\"    \"Yes, certainly,\" answered Dick, \"by all means.  But before we think of  tackling those lions I must see that poor beggar who was mauled.  Two  days ago!  By Jove, I dread to think of what the state of his wounds  must be in this hot weather, that is, if he is still alive.  Just ask  them, Jantje, whether the boy who was mauled is still living, or whether  the lions killed him?\"    The question was put, and Jantje duly interpreted the reply.    \"Yes, sar, de boy he still alive, but most drefful sick, dhese people  say.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Dick, dismounting from his horse.  \"Then say to them  that I am a great doctor, and that I intend to save the poor fellow's  life if I can.  I want one of them to carry my medicine chest for me,  and to take me to the injured man's hut.  Then you had better take the  wagon down and outspan near the river, where the grass is good, but  where our oxen are not likely to get among the mealies, and then come to  me, for I shall probably need you to interpret for me.\"    The first part of this speech being interpreted to the little crowd of  natives, one of them at once stepped forward, expressing himself as  willing to carry the medicine chest and act as guide, while another  volunteered to point out a suitable and convenient spot upon which to  outspan, the others forthwith breaking into a song of thanksgiving in  which they announced to all and sundry that this was their lucky day,  inasmuch as that the white _'mlungus_ were not only going to make well  again their brother who was nigh unto death, but were also going to  utterly root out and destroy those cunning beasts who refused to come  out into the open and face their assagais.  Grosvenor announced his  intention of accompanying Dick, and five minutes later the pair, with  their sable guide leading the way and carrying the medicine chest, were  _en route_ for the village, Dick carrying his case of surgical  instruments under his arm.  Their rifles they left with the wagon,  deeming it unnecessary to cumber themselves with superfluous weapons in  face of the fact that the villagers were obviously quite friendly  disposed to white men, indeed they were still too close to civilisation  to anticipate anything else.    As they neared the village the \"boy\" who preceded them began to shout  the great news that the white men were coming to make whole the injured  man, and the occupants of the huts, to the number of about two hundred  men, women, and children, swarmed out to gaze upon the strangers.  The  guide, who was inclined to put on airs, upon the strength of being the  bearer of the white men's _muti_, would fain have made the most of the  occasion by pausing in the centre of the village and haranguing his  fellows, but Dick nipped the intention ruthlessly in the bud by  repeating several times, in an imperative tone of voice, the word  _hamba_ (go), and presently the procession--for every occupant of the  village formed up and followed the trio--came to a halt in front of one  of the huts.    As the bearer of the medicine chest pushed his burden in through the  low, narrow entrance of the hut, and dropped on hands and knees in order  to follow it, Dick turned and, perceiving a disposition on the part of  the crowd to gather close about the entrance, and so exclude what little  light and air might otherwise make its way in, took an assagai from the  hand of an astonished native, and, holding it by the blade, waved the  press back with the butt end of the weapon.  Then, still waving the butt  end, he described on the ground the arc of a circle of some twelve feet  radius from the hut entrance, and, returning the weapon to its owner,  pointed to the mark on the ground, and, addressing the curiosity-ridden  mob, said impressively in English:    \"Now, good people, please have the goodness to keep carefully outside  that line, and oblige yours truly!\"    There was not one of those odoriferous, dark-skinned Kafirs who  comprehended a word of English, but Dick's actions and the tones of his  voice were so expressive that his meaning was almost as distinctly  understood as though he had spoken in the language of the tribe.  He saw  at once that this was so, and that his wishes would be obeyed, and  signing to Grosvenor to precede him, forthwith passed into the hut.    Entering the windowless structure straight from the dazzling sunshine  that flooded the outside world, the two Englishmen found themselves  plunged for the moment in a darkness so profound that they could see  nothing, and were fain to stand just where they rose to their feet after  creeping through the low doorway, lest, moving, they should stumble over  something--possibly the patient.  But in addition to the hot, close  odour of the interior of the hut there was another taint that assailed  their nostrils, the taint of festering wounds, with which Dick was  already familiar, and he shook his head doubtfully as he turned to the  figure of Grosvenor, just beginning to reveal itself in the midst of the  enveloping obscurity, and said:    \"I don't like this at all.  I can't see my patient as yet, but there is  a certain something in the atmosphere of this hut which tells me that if  the poor beggar's life is to be saved we have no time to waste.  Where  is he, I wonder?  Oh, I think I see him, there on the ground at the far  side from the doorway!  Yes, there he is.  Another minute and I shall be  able to see him clearly.  Meanwhile, perhaps his pulse will tell us  something.\"    And, crossing to the far side of the hut, he knelt down by the side of  the indistinctly seen man, felt for his hand, and, having found it, laid  his fingers upon the wrist.        CHAPTER SIX.    AN ENCOUNTER WITH LIONS.    \"Um!\" murmured Dick, as the feeble throbbing of the man's pulse met his  finger tips; \"quite as I expected.  Very low and weak.  Evidently  sinking from exhaustion.  I must have him out of this into a better  light, although I am almost afraid to run the risk of moving him.  Still, it must be done.  I can see nothing here.\"    He went to the door of the hut and looked out, the crowd still grouped  on the outside of the curve he had described on the ground respectfully  making way before him.  There was a small but densely foliaged tree  growing at no great distance from the hut, and casting a strong shadow  upon the ground; that, Dick decided, would be as good a place as any for  his purpose.  As he was about to re-enter the hut there arose a slight  commotion upon the outskirts of the crowd, and presently Jantje, the  Hottentot driver, appeared, endeavouring to force his way through to his  master.  The sight was a welcome one, for Dick felt very much at a loss  with no one to interpret for him, and in tones of unmistakable relief he  lifted up his voice and shouted:    \"Come along, Jantje; you are just the man I wanted.\"  Then, as the  Hottentot joined him, he continued: \"See here, Jantje, I want the  wounded man very carefully removed from the hut, and carried over yonder  into the shadow of that tree.  Just explain to these fellows, will you,  and ask them to help me.\"    No sooner said than done; with the passing of the last word through  Jantje's lips half a dozen stalwart Kafirs dived into the hut and in  another moment reappeared, bearing between them the unhappy patient,  stretched upon an eland's skin.  It was an exceedingly awkward job to  get the poor fellow out through the low, narrow doorway of the hut, but  they managed it somehow, and in another minute had him satisfactorily  disposed beneath the shadow of the tree.  Then Dick approached and  proceeded to examine his hurts.    They had been severe enough to start with; but now, after nearly forty-  eight hours of neglect, their condition was so indescribably loathsome  that even Dick, seasoned hand though he was, nearly vomited at the sight  of them, while as for Grosvenor, he was compelled to beat a precipitate  retreat, but returned gamely, some five minutes later, to see if he  could be of any assistance.  Dick, however, although he had never in his  life before beheld anything approaching such a dreadful sight, quickly  pulled himself together and, his professional instinct promptly  asserting itself, ordered some hot water to be brought to him, and,  while it was being prepared, opened his medicine chest and his case of  surgical instruments, the rest of the inhabitants of the village  gathering round in a wide, silent, awestruck circle.  They had often  before seen similar sights, and were therefore in a measure accustomed  to them; they knew what the patient's condition meant, and there was not  one among them who did not regard the injured man as already as good as  dead.  Nevertheless their curiosity was powerfully aroused; for they had  heard many wonderful stories of the white men who had lately come into  the country toward the south, and were eager to see whether or not it  was true that they could perform miracles, as had been asserted.    As for Dick, he found himself confronted at the outset by a very serious  difficulty.  His patient's condition was such that he could not possibly  do what was necessary without inflicting upon the unfortunate man an  amount of suffering that in his low and exhausted condition threatened  to result in collapse and death.  The man was too far gone, indeed, to  justify the use of anaesthetics, yet without them Dick feared to  proceed.  What was he to do?  Suddenly he bethought himself of  hypnotism.  Yet, how hypnotise a man whose language he could not speak?  Then he remembered a very remarkable statement which Humphreys had made  when discussing this same subject of hypnotism.  \"It is not the actual  words which you address to a patient,\" Humphreys had asserted, \"but the"]]]
