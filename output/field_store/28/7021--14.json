Have him get some little  candles for the tree.\"    \"My head hurts me,\" the old man gave out; \"this ain't the place for a  great noisy boy.\"    Ellen put her hand on his shoulder almost maternally.    \"See, dear,\" she said, \"then you'd be grandfather.\"    \"Hey?\" he said; \"not if it was adopted, I wouldn't.\"    \"Why, of course. That would make it ours--and yours. See,\" she cried,  \"you've been stringing popcorn for it already, and you didn't know!\"    \"Be grandfather, would I?\" said the old man. \"Would I? Hey, king and  country! Grandfather again.\"    Ellen was moving about the kitchen lightly, with that manner, which  eager interest brings, of leaving only half footprints.    \"Come on, mother,\" she said, \"we must get the popcorn strung for sure,  now!\"    The mother looked up at the tree. \"Seems as if,\" she said, wrinkling her  forehead, \"I used to make pink tarleton stockings for your trees and  fill 'em with the corn. I donno but I've got a little piece of pink  tarleton somewheres in my bottom drawer....\"    ... Next night they had the bracket lamp and the lamp on the shelf and  the table hand lamp all burning. The little tree was gay with the white  corn and the coloured trifles. The kitchen seemed to be centering in the  tree, as if the room had been concerned long enough with the doings of  these grown folk and now were looking ahead to see who should come next.  It was the high moment of immemorial expectancy, when those who are  alive turn the head to see who shall come after.    \"What you been making all day, daddy?\" Ellen asked, tense at every sound  from without.    Her father, neat in his best clothes, blew away a last plume of shaved  wood and held out something.    \"I just whittled out a kind of a clothespin man,\" he explained. \"I made  one for you, once, and you liked it like everything. Mebbe a boy won't?\"  he added doubtfully.    \"Oh, but a boy will!\" Ellen cried, and tied the doll above the blue  paper soldier.    \"Hadn't they ought to be here pretty soon?\" Matthew asked nervously.  \"Where's mother?\"    \"She's watching from the front room window,\" Ellen answered.    Once more Helders came stamping on the kitchen porch, but this time  there was a patter of other steps, and Ellen caught open the door before  he summoned. Helders stepped into the room, and with him was a little  boy.    \"This one?\" Ellen asked, her eyes alive with her eagerness.    But Helders shook his head.    \"Mis' Bourne,\" he said, \"I'm real dead sorry. They wa'n't but the one.  Just the one we'd spoke for.\"    \"_One!_\" Ellen said; \"you said Orphan Asylum.\"    \"There's only the one,\" Helders repeated. \"The others is little bits of  babies, or else spoke for like ours--long ago. It seems they do that  way. But I want you should do something: I want you and Matthew should  take this one. Mother and I--are older ... we ain't set store so much....\"    Ellen shook her head, and made him know, with what words she could find,  that it could not be so. Then she knelt and touched at the coat of the  child, a small frightened thing, with cap too large for him and one  mitten lost. But he looked up brightly, and his eyes stayed on the  Christmas tree. Ellen said little things to him, and went to take down  for him some trifle from the tree.    \"I'm just as much obliged,\" she said quietly to Helders. \"I never  thought of there not being enough. We'll wait.\"    Helders was fumbling for something.    \"Here's your candles, I thought you might want them for somethin' else,\"  he said, and turned to Matthew: \"And here's your quarter. I didn't get  the toy you mentioned. I thought you wouldn't want it, without the  little kid.\"    Matthew looked swiftly at Ellen. He had not told her that he had sent by  Helders for a toy. And at that Ellen crossed abruptly to her husband,  and she was standing there as they let Helders out, with the little boy.    Ellen's father pounded his knee.    \"But how long'll we have to wait? How long'll we have to wait?\" he  demanded shrilly. \"King and country, why didn't somebody ask him that?\"    Matthew tore open the door.    \"Helders!\" he shouted, \"how long did they say we'd have to wait?\"    \"Mebbe only a week or two--mebbe longer,\" Helders' voice came out of the  dark. \"They couldn't tell me.\"    Ellen's mother stood fastening up a fallen tinsel walnut.    \"Let's us leave the tree right where it is,\" she said. \"Even with it  here, we won't have enough Christmas to hurt anything.\"          XI      On that morning of the day before Christmas, Mary Chavah woke early,  while it was yet dark. With closed eyes she lay, in the grip of a dream  that was undissipated by her waking. In the dream she had seen a little  town lying in a hollow, lighted and peopled, but without foundation.    \"It isn't born yet,\" they told her, who looked with her, \"and the people  are not yet born.\"    \"Who is the mother?\" she had asked, as if everything must be born of  woman.    \"You,\" they had answered.    On which the town had swelled and rounded and swung in a hollow of  cloud, globed and shining, like the world.    \"You,\" they had kept on saying.    The sense that she must bear and mother the thing had grasped her with  all the sickening force of dream fear. And when the dream slipped into  the remembrance of what the day would bring her, the grotesque terror  hardly lessened, and she woke to a sense of oppression and coming  calamity such as not even her night of decision to take the child had  brought to her, a weight as of physical faintness and sickness.    \"I feel as if something was going to happen,\" she said, over and over.    She was wholly ignorant that in that week just passed the word had been  liberated and had run round Old Trail Town in the happiest open  secrecy:--    \"... coming way from Idaho, with a tag on, Christmas Eve. We thought if  everybody could call that night--just run into Mary's, you know, like it  was any other night, and take in a little something to eat--no presents,  you know ... oh, of course, no presents! Just supper, in a basket. We'd  all have to eat _some_-where. It won't be any Christmas celebration, of  course--oh, no, not with the paper signed and all. But just for us to  kind of meet and be there, when he gets off the train from Idaho.\"    \"Just ... like it was any other night.\" That was the part that abated  suspicion. Indeed, that had been the very theory on which the  nonobservance of Christmas had been based: the day was to be treated  like any other day. And, obviously, on any other day such a simple plan  as this for the welcoming of a little stranger from Idaho would have  gone forward as a matter of course. Why deny him this, merely because  the night of his arrival chanced to be Christmas Eve? When Christmas was  to be treated _exactly_ as any other day?    If, in the heart of Mis' Abby Winslow, where the plan had originated, it  had originated side by side with the thought that the point of the plan  was the incidence of Christmas Eve, she kept her belief secret. The open  argument was unassailable, and she contented herself with that. Even  Simeon Buck, confronted with it, was silent.    \"Goin' back on the paper, are you?\" he had at first said, \"and hev a  celebration?\"    \"Celebration of what?\" Mis' Winslow demanded; \"celebration of that  little boy getting here all alone, 'way from Idaho. And we'd celebrate  that any other night, wouldn't we? Of course we would. Our paper signing  don't call for us to give everybody the cold shoulder as I know of, just  because it's Christmas or Christmas Eve, either.\"    \"No,\" Simeon owned, \"of course it don't. Of course it don't.\"    As for Abel Ames, he accepted the proposal with an alacrity which he was  put to it to conceal.    \"So do,\" he said heartily, \"so do. I guess we can go ahead just like it  was a plain day o' the week, can't we?\"    \"Hetty,\" he said to his wife, whom that noon he went through the house  to the kitchen expressly to tell, \"can you bake up a basket of stuff to  take over to Mary Chavah's next Tuesday night?\"    She looked up from the loaf she was cutting, the habitual wonder of her  childish curved lashes accented by her sudden curving of eyebrows.    \"Next Tuesday?\" she said, \"Why, that's Christmas eve!\"    Abel explained, saying, \"What of that?\" and trying to speak  indifferently but, in spite of himself, shining through.    \"Well, that's kind of nice to do, ain't it?\" she answered.    \"My, yes,\" Abel said, emphatically, \"It's a thing to do--that's the  thing to do.\"    It was Mis' Mortimer Bates, the nonconformist by nature, in whom doubts  came nearest to expression.    \"I _don't_ know,\" she said, \"it kind of _does_ seem like hedging.\"    \"They ain't anybody for it to seem to,\" Mis' Winslow contended  reasonably, \"but us. And we understand.\"    \"We was going to do entirely without a Christmas this year. Entirely  without,\" Mis' Bates rehearsed.    \"Was we going to do entirely without everyday, week-day,  year-in-and-year-out milk of human kindness?\" Mis' Winslow demanded.  \"Well, then, let's us use a little of it, same as we would on a Monday  wash day.\"    No voice was raised in real protest. None who had signed the paper and  none who had not done so could take exception to this simple way of  hospitality to the little stranger with a tag on. And it was the glory  of the little town being a little town that they somehow let it be known  that every one was expected to look in at Mary's that night. No one was  uninvited. And this was like a part of the midwinter mystery expressing  itself unbidden.    Mary alone was not told. She had consistently objected to the Christmas  observances for so long that they feared the tyranny of her custom. \"She  might not let us do it,\" they said, \"but if we all get there, she can't  help liking it. She would on any other day....\"    ...

He then assailed the propaganda carried out by German emissaries  through certain news agencies, and the corruption of certain papers of  the Rumanian press.    And during all this time, concluded Mr. Mille, our brethren in  Transylvania are being exterminated by war while expecting our  intervention. The Government must break its silence, which is becoming  more and more suspicious, and frankly affirm its intention.      RUMANIA'S POLICY.    [From The London Daily Telegraph of Dec. 29, 1914.]    BUCHAREST, Dec. 28.    Today, in the debate on the address in reply to the message from the  throne, the Prime Minister repeated the declaration made in the  Chamber asking the majority to waive discussion and the Opposition to  leave the Government full liberty of action to fulfill its great duty.    The Conservative Party, by the mouth of its chief, expressed its  willingness to do this. M. Disesco, on behalf of the Conservative  Democrats, repeated the declaration made by M. Take Jonesco, in the  Chamber, according to which Rumania ought to abandon her neutral  position and make an immediate alliance with the Triple Entente.    M. Disesco added that the Rumano-Austro-German alliance ceased to  exist from the day when the Crown Council was held at Sinaeia; that  council settled the matter of Rumania's neutrality. The speaker laid  stress on the ingratitude of Austria toward Rumania in 1913, and  alluded to the statements made recently by M. Take Jonesco concerning  the threat of Austria against Rumania in 1913 should that country  attack Bulgaria.    He concluded by observing that the two sections of the Opposition,  Conservative and Conservative-Democrat, had declared for abandonment  of neutrality and an alliance with the Triple Entente, and expressed  the hope that presently this policy will be adopted officially. The  address was afterward agreed to unanimously.    A large number of Senators telegraphed to the President of the  Italo-Rumanian League at Rome expressing their happiness at witnessing  the realization of the league's initiative, and requesting the  President to consider them members of the Rumanian section of the  league, which, being convinced of the profound significance and great  usefulness of closer relations between the two countries, they joined  with enthusiasm.      \"LEAGUE OF UNITY.\"    BUCHAREST, Dec. 27.    At a special session today the League for the National Unity of All  Rumanians acclaimed with grand enthusiasm the new committee, which has  as President the Rev. Father Lucaci, the great propagandist of and  martyr for the Rumanian cause in Transylvania and a member of the  Rumanian National Committee of Hungary. There were also elected MM.  Take Jonesco, Nicolas Filipescu, and Delavrance Gradischteano, all  former Ministers. The committee is charged with the hastening of  action by Rumania for the conquest of the Rumanian provinces of  Austria-Hungary.      RUMANIAN STATISTICS.    [From Le Messager d'Athenes, Nov. 28, 1914.]    According to statistics published in a Rumanian paper, when the  foreign press speaks of Rumanian aspirations it sums up the whole  question in the word Transylvania.    It is not unnecessary perhaps to remark that this word has in this  case a significance rather political and ethnological than purely  geographical. This word comprises all the Austro-Hungarian territories  occupied by Rumanians, with the understanding that Transylvania is the  most important as regards area and Rumanian popularity.    Actually the Rumanian claims on the Austro-Hungarian territories are  the following:    Transylvania--57,250 square kilometers, 2,850,000 inhabitants, of whom  1,750,000 are Rumanians.    Banat--28,510 square kilometers area, and 1,730,000 inhabitants, of  whom 700,000 are Rumanians.    Chrishana--Area, 41,338 square kilometers, and 2,920,000 inhabitants,  of whom 1,100,000 are Rumanians.    Mamoaresh--Area, 9,720 square kilometers, and 360,000 inhabitants, of  whom 120,000 are Rumanians.    Bukowina--Area, 10,471 square kilometers, and 900,000 inhabitants, of  whom 300,000 are Rumanians.    Total area, 147,280 square kilometers, and 8,760,000 inhabitants, of  whom 3,970,000 are Rumanians.    In consequence, of 8,760,000 inhabitants of trans-Carpathian Rumania,  nearly 4,000,000 are Rumanians, 2,200,000 Hungarians, 1,000,000  Serbo-Croatians, 730,000 Germans, and so on.      RUMANIA'S CLAIMS.    [From The London Times, Nov. 25, 1914.]    SOFIA, Nov. 23.    The efforts made by Germany and Austria-Hungary to win over Rumania,  or at least to induce her to refrain from prosecuting her claims to  Transylvania, are being pursued with indefatigable energy and  perseverance. The same methods are being employed in Bucharest as  here, but on an even larger scale. The issues involved seem to be more  fully realized by the Central European powers than by their opponents,  and no pains are being spared to draw Rumania and Bulgaria within the  orbit of their influence.    The campaign in Bucharest was at first attended by a certain measure  of success, owing to the attitude of M. Bratiano, the Premier; of M.  Carp, a former Prime Minister, and of M. Marghiloman, the present  leader of the Conservative Opposition. But many influential Liberals  have already associated themselves with the programme of the action  advocated by M. Take Jonesco, the chief of the Conservative-Democratic  Party, and of M. Filipescu, a former Conservative Minister, whose  advocacy of a forward policy threatens to cause a split in the  Conservative camp. The great bulk of the political world desires to  profit by the European crisis to secure Transylvania, the only  difference of opinion being with regard to the advisability of  immediate action. The consultative committee of the Conservative Party  has passed a resolution demanding the abandonment of neutrality.    The concessions offered by Count Tisza, the Hungarian Premier, in the  hope of averting the coming storm, make no impression on the Rumanians  either within or without the monarchy. He promises to allow the  teaching of Rumanian in the schools, the use of the language in the  public services, and increased Rumanian representation in the  Hungarian Parliament. But the time for concessions has gone by. The  Austrian advance into Servia threatens to cut off Rumania from  Southern and Western Europe and to prevent the arrival from the  United States of the large supplies of stores and medicaments ordered  there.    It is evident that neither Rumania nor Bulgaria can long maintain  their present attitudes. It remains for the powers of the Entente to  devise a means for securing the co-operation of both States.    Servia recently inquired in Bucharest whether Rumania would oppose  territorial concessions to a neighboring State, evidently indicating  Bulgaria. Rumania replied that she would be happy to see all the  quarrels of her neighbors arranged. The Government at Nish,  appreciating the necessities of the situation, is now disposed toward  a policy of concession. Servia's only hope of maintaining an  independent existence lies in the success of the Entente powers. She  is, therefore, bound to consent to any course they may deem necessary  at the present juncture.      UTTERANCES OF STATESMEN.    _The New York Daily Greek Atlantis, in its issue of Nov. 21, 1914,  reports as follows the statement of three Rumanian leaders to a Greek  paper in Constantinople. The Rumanian Foreign Minister, Mr. Purumbaru,  said:_    Rumania is inspired by a sincere desire not to displease either of the  two European Georges. Having adopted a policy of neutrality, she will  maintain it to the end. Russia has expressed her satisfaction with the  present attitude of Rumania, while Austria, since the beginning of the  war, has avoided taking any oppressive measures against the Rumanians  of Transylvania. As regards Italy, the Rumanian people harbor the  friendliest intentions toward her. The Italo-Rumanian relations are  most cordial. In Rumania the policy of Italy is followed with much  attention. The relations of Rumania toward the other Balkan States,  and especially toward Servia and Greece, are good. It is true that the  Bulgarian intentions are not very clear. It appears, however, that the  desire for peace is strong in Sofia, where it is felt that the  interest of Bulgaria lies in adapting rather the country to the  present situation than in throwing it into a struggle whose results  would be unknown beforehand.    As for Servia, Rumania has not intervened on her behalf in this war,  as it had not its origin in the Treaty of Bucharest.    In accordance with the common understanding of all the Balkan States,  Rumania is always in favor of a union of them all, but opposes any  combination between two or more Balkan States to the detriment of  another.    _M. Jonesco, leader of the Opposition, spoke on the Balkan situation  as follows:_    I always believed and still believe that the Balkan States cannot  secure their future otherwise than by a close understanding among  themselves, whether this understanding shall or shall not take the  form of a federation. No one of the Balkan States is strong enough to  resist the pressure from one or another of the European powers.    For this reason I am deeply grieved to see in the Balkan coalition of  1912 Rumania not invited. If Rumania had taken part in the first one,  we should not have had the second. I did all that was in my power and  succeeded in preventing the war between Rumania and the Balkan League  in the Winter of 1912-1913.    I risked my popularity, and I do not feel sorry for it. "]]]
