DISPIRITED AND DEMORALISED.      Our first intention was to proceed to Vereeniging, there to join  General Botha's forces. At Klip River Station, that preceding  Vereeniging, I was ordered, however, to leave my carts behind and  proceed with my men to Vaalbank, as the enemy were advancing with  forced marches, and had compelled all the other commandos to fall back  on Vereeniging.    On our way we met groups of retreating burghers, each of whom gave us  a different version of the position. Some said that the enemy had  already swept past Vereeniging, others that they could not now be  stopped until they reached Johannesburg. Further on, we had the good  fortune to encounter General Botha and his staff. The General ordered  me to take up a position at the Gatsrand, near the Nek at  Pharaohsfontein, as the British, having split their forces up into two  parts, would send one portion to cross the Vaal River at Lindeque's  Drift, whilst the other detachments would follow the railway past  Vereeniging. Generals Lemmer and Grobler were already posted at the  Gatsrand to obstruct the enemy's progress.    I asked General Botha how we stood. He sighed, and answered: \"If only  the burghers would fight we could stop them easily enough; but I  cannot get a single burgher to start fighting. I hope their running  mood will soon change into a fighting mood. You keep your spirits up,  and let us do our duty.\"    \"All right, General,\" I answered, and we shook hands heartily.    We rode on through the evening and at midnight halted at a farm to  give our horses rest and fodder. The owner of the farm was absent on  duty, and his family had been left behind. On our approach the  women-folk, mistaking us for Englishmen, were terrified out of their  wits. Remembering the atrocities and horrors committed in Natal on the  advance of the Imperial troops, they awaited the coming of the  English with the greatest terror. On the approach of the enemy many  women and children forsook their homes and wandered about in caves and  woods for days, exposed to every privation and inclemency of the  weather, and to the attacks of wandering bands of plundering kaffirs.    Mrs. van der Merwe, whom we met here, was exceedingly kind to us, and  gave us plenty of fodder for our horses. We purchased some sheep, and  slaughtered them and enjoyed a good meal before sunrise; and each one  of us bore away a good-sized piece of mutton as provisions for the  future.    Our scouts, whom we had despatched over night, informed us that  Generals Lemmer and Grobler had taken up their stand to the right of  Pharaohsfontein in the Gatsrand, and that the English were approaching  in enormous force.    By nine in the morning we had taken up our positions, and at noon the  enemy came in sight. Our commando had been considerably reduced, as  many burghers, finding themselves near their homes, had applied for  twenty-four hours' leave, which had been granted in order to allow  them to arrange matters before the advance of the English on their  farms made it impossible. A few also had deserted for the time being,  unable to resist the temptation of visiting their families in the  neighbourhood.    Some old burghers approached us and hailed us with the usual \"Morning,  boys! Which commando do you belong to?\"    \"Viljoen's.\"    \"We would like to see your Commandant,\" they answered.    Presenting myself, I asked: \"Who are you, and where do you come from,  and where are you going to?\"    They answered: \"We are scouts of General Lemmer and we came to see who  is holding this position.\"    \"But surely General Lemmer knows that I am here?\"    [Illustration: A Surprise.--Coyell Meeting the Imperial Light Horse.]    \"Very probably,\" they replied, \"but we wanted to know for ourselves;  we thought we might find some of our friends amongst you. You come  from Natal, don't you?\"    \"Yes,\" I answered sadly. \"We have come to reinforce the others, but I  fear we can be of little use. It seems to me that it will be here as  it was in Natal; all running and no fighting.\"    \"Alas!\" they said, \"the Free Staters will not remain in one position,  and we must admit the Transvaalers are also very disheartened.  However, if the British once cross our frontiers you will find that  the burghers will fight to the bitter end.\"    Consoled by this pretty promise we made up our minds to do our best,  but our outposts presently brought word that the British were bearing  to the right and nearing General Grobler's position, and had passed  round that of General Lemmer. Whilst they attacked General Grobler's  we attacked their flank, but we could not do much damage, as we were  without guns. Soon after the enemy directed a heavy artillery fire on  us, to which we, being on flat ground, found ourselves dangerously  exposed.    Towards evening the enemy were in possession of General Grobler's  position, and were passing over the Gatsrand, leaving us behind. I  ordered my commando to fall back on Klipriversberg, while I rode away  with some adjutants to attempt to put myself in communication with the  other commandos.    The night was dark and cloudy, which rendered it somewhat difficult  for us to move about in safety. We occasionally fell into ditches and  trenches, and had much trouble with barbed wire. However, we finally  fell in with General Lemmer's rearguard, who informed us that the  enemy, after having overcome the feeble resistance of General Grobler,  had proceeded north, and all the burghers were retreating in haste  before them.    We rode on past the enemy to find General Grobler and what his plans  were. We rode quite close to the English camp, as we knew that they  seldom posted sentries far from their tents. On this occasion,  however, they had placed a guard in an old \"klipkraal,\" for them a  prodigious distance from their camp, and a \"Tommy\" hailed us from the  darkness.--    \"Halt, who goes there?\"    I replied \"Friend,\" whereupon the guileless soldier answered:    \"Pass, friend, all's well.\"    I had my doubts, however. He might be a Boer outpost anxious to  ascertain if we were Englishmen. Afraid to ride into ambush of my own  men, I called out in Dutch:    \"Whose men are you?\"    The Tommy lost his temper at being kept awake so long and retorted  testily, \"I can't understand your beastly Dutch; come here and be  recognized.\" But we did not wait for identification, and I rode off  shouting back \"Thanks, my compliments to General French, and tell him  that his outposts are asleep.\"    This was too much for the \"Tommy\" and his friends, who answered with a  volley of rifle fire, which was taken up by the whole line of British  outposts. No harm was done, however, and we soon rode out of range. I  gave up looking for General Grobler, and on the following morning  rejoined my men at Klipriversberg.    It was by no means easy to find out the exact position of affairs.  Our scouts reported that the enemy's left wing, having broken through  General Grobler's position, were now marching along Van Wijk's Rust. I  could, however, obtain no definite information regarding the right  wing, nor could I discover the General under whose orders I was to  place myself. General Lemmer, moreover, was suffering from an acute  disease of the kidneys, which had compelled him to hand over his  command to Commandant Gravett, who had proved himself an excellent  officer.    General Grobler had lost the majority of his men, or what was more  likely the case, they had lost him. He declared that he was unaware of  General Botha's or Mr. Kruger's plans, and that it was absurd to keep  running away, but he clearly did not feel equal to any more fighting,  although he had not the moral courage to openly say so. From this  point this gentleman did no further service to his country, and was  shortly afterwards dismissed. The reader will now gather an idea of  the enormous change which had come over our troops. Six months before  they had been cheerful and gay, confident of the ultimate success of  their cause; now they were downhearted and in the lowest of spirits. I  must admit that in this our officers were no exception.    Those were dark days for us. Now began the real fighting, and this  under the most difficult and distressing circumstances; and I think  that if our leaders could have had a glimpse of the difficulties and  hardships that were before us, they would not have had the courage to  proceed any further in the struggle.    Early next morning (the 29th May, 1900) we reached Klipspruit, and  found there several other commandos placed in extended order all the  way up to Doornkop.    Amongst them was that of General De la Rey, who had come from the  Western frontier of our Republic, and that of General Snyman, whom I  regard as the real defender and reliever of Mafeking, for he was  afraid to attack a garrison of 1,000 men with twice that number of  burghers.    Before having had time to properly fortify our position we were  attacked on the right flank by General French's cavalry, while the  left flank had to resist a strong opposing force of cavalry. Both  attacks were successfully repulsed, as well as a third in the centre  of our fighting line.    The British now marched on Doornkop, their real object of attack being  our extreme right wing, but they made a feint on our left. Our line of  defence was very extended and weakened by the removal of a body of men  who had been sent to Natal Spruit to stop the other body of the enemy  from forcing its way along the railway line and cutting off our  retreat to Pretoria.    The battle lasted till sunset, and was especially fierce on our right,  where the Krugersdorpers stood. Early in the evening our right wing  had to yield to an overwhelming force, and during the night all the  commandos had to fall back. My commando, which should have consisted  of about 450 men, only "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#14)"],[1,"them at once at the  candle before her.    At last she made up her mind.  Just as she had done when a baby she  realised that the opposing forces were too strong for her; she gave in  gracefully.  It would not do to deal directly in a letter with the matter  in hand.  She would write to Leonard merely asking him to see her.  Then,  when they were together without fear of interruption, she would tell him  her views.    She got as far as 'Dear Mr. Leonard,' when she stood up, saying to  herself:    'I shall not be in a hurry.  I must sleep on it before I write!'  She  took up the novel she had been reading in the afternoon, and read on at  it steadily till her bedtime.    That night she did not sleep.  It was not that she was agitated.  Indeed,  she was more at ease than she had been for days; she had after much  anxious thought made up her mind to a definite course of action.  Therefore her sleeplessness was not painful.  It was rather that she did  not want to sleep, than that she could not.  She lay still, thinking,  thinking; dreaming such dreams as are the occasions of sanctified privacy  to her age and sex.    In the morning she was no worse for her vigil.  When at luncheon-time  Aunt Laetitia had returned she went into all the little matters of which  she had to report.  It was after tea-time when she found herself alone,  and with leisure to attend to what was, she felt, directly her own  affair.  During the night she had made up her mind exactly what to say to  Leonard; and as her specific resolution bore the test of daylight she was  satisfied.  The opening words had in their inception caused her some  concern; but after hours of thought she had come to the conclusion that  to address, under the circumstance, the recipient of the letter as 'Dear  Mr. Everard' would hardly do.  The only possible justification of her  unconventional act was that there existed already a friendship, an  intimacy of years, since childhood; that there were already between them  knowledge and understanding of each other; that what she was doing, and  about to do, was but a further step in a series of events long ago  undertaken.    She thought it better to send by post rather than messenger, as the  latter did away with all privacy with regard to the act.    The letter was as follows:       'DEAR LEONARD,--Would it be convenient for you to meet me to-morrow,     Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock on the top of Caester Hill?  I     want to speak about a matter that may have some interest to you, and     it will be more private there than in the house.  Also it will be     cooler in the shade on the hilltop.--       Yours sincerely, STEPHEN NORMAN.'    Having posted the letter she went about the usual routine of her life at  Normanstand, and no occasion of suspicion or remark regarding her came to  her aunt.    In her room that night when she had sent away her maid, she sat down to  think, and all the misgivings of the day came back.  One by one they were  conquered by one protective argument:    'I am free to do as I like.  I am my own mistress; and I am doing nothing  that is wrong.  Even if it is unconventional, what of that?  God knows  there are enough conventions in the world that are wrong, hopelessly,  unalterably wrong.  After all, who are the people who are most bound by  convention?  Those who call themselves \"smart!\"  If Convention is the god  of the smart set, then it is about time that honest people chose  another!'    * * * * *    Leonard received the letter at breakfast-time.  He did not give it any  special attention, as he had other letters at the same time, some of  which were, if less pleasant, of more immediate importance.  He had of  late been bombarded with dunning letters from tradesmen; for during his  University life, and ever since, he had run into debt.  The moderate  allowance his father made him he had treated as cash for incidental  expenses, but everything else had been on credit.  Indeed he was  beginning to get seriously alarmed about the future, for his father, who  had paid his debts once, and at a time when they were by comparison  inconsiderable, had said that he would not under any circumstances pay  others.  He was not sorry, therefore, for an opportunity of getting away  for a few hours from home; from himself--from anxieties, possibilities.  The morning was a sweltering one, and he grumbled to himself as he set  out on his journey through the woods.    * * * * *    Stephen rose fresh and in good spirits, despite her sleepless night.  When  youth and strength are to the fore, a night's sleep is not of much  account, for the system once braced up is not allowed to slacken.  It was  a notable sign of her strong nature that she was not even impatient, but  waited with calm fixity the hour at which she had asked Leonard Everard  to meet her.  It is true that as the time grew closer her nerve was less  marked.  And just before it she was a girl--and nothing more; with all  girl's diffidence, a girl's self-distrust, a girl's abnegation, a girl's  plasticity.    In the more purely personal aspect of her enterprise Stephen's effort was  more conscious.  It is hardly possible for a pretty woman to seek in her  study of perfection the aid of her mirror and to be unconscious of her  aims.  There must certainly be at least one dominant purpose: the  achievement of success.  Stephen did not attempt to deny her own beauty;  on the contrary she gave it the fullest scope.  There was a certain  triumph in her glance as she took her last look in her mirror; a  gratification of her wish to show herself in the best way possible.  It  was a very charming picture which the mirror reflected.    It may be that there is a companionship in a mirror, especially to a  woman; that the reflection of oneself is an emboldening presence, a  personality which is better than the actuality of an unvalued stranger.  Certainly, when Stephen closed the door and stood in the wainscoted  passage, which was only dimly lit by the high window at either end, her  courage seemed at once to ooze away.    Probably for the first time in her life, as she left the shade of the  long passage and came out on the staircase flooded with the light of the  noonday sun, Stephen felt that she was a girl--'girl' standing as some  sort of synonym for weakness, pretended or actual.  Fear, in whatever  form or degree it may come, is a vital quality and must move.  It cannot  stand at a fixed point; if it be not sent backward it must progress.  Stephen felt this, and, though her whole nature was repugnant to the  task, forced herself to the effort of repression.  It would, she felt,  have been to her a delicious pleasure to have abandoned all effort; to  have sunk in the lassitude of self-surrender.    The woman in her was working; her sex had found her out!    She turned and looked around her, as though conscious of being watched.  Then, seeing that she was alone, she went her way with settled purpose;  with flashing eyes and glowing cheeks--and a beating heart.  A heart all  woman's since it throbbed the most with apprehension when the enemy, Man,  was the objective of her most resolute attack.  She knew that she must  keep moving; that she must not stop or pause; or her whole resolution  must collapse.  And so she hurried on, fearful lest a chance meeting with  any one might imperil her purpose.    On she went through the faint moss-green paths; through meadows rich with  flowering grasses and the many reds of the summer wild-flowers.  And so  up through the path cut in the natural dipping of the rock that rose over  Caester Hill and formed a strong base for the clump of great trees that  made a landmark for many a mile around.  During the first part of her  journey between the house and the hilltop, she tried to hold her purpose  at arm's length; it would be sufficient to face its terrors when the time  had come.  In the meantime the matter was of such overwhelming importance  that nothing else could take its place; all she could do was to suspend  the active part of the thinking faculties and leave the mind only  receptive.    But when she had passed through the thin belt of stunted oak and beech  which hedged in the last of the lush meadows, and caught sight of the  clump of trees on the hilltop, she unconsciously braced herself as a  young regiment loses its tremors when the sight of the enemy breaks upon  it.  No longer her eyes fell earthward; they were raised, and raised  proudly.  Stephen Norman was fixed in her intention.  Like the woman of  old, her feet were on the ploughshares and she would not hesitate.    As she drew near the appointed place her pace grew slower and slower; the  woman in her was unconsciously manifesting itself.  She would not be  first in her tryst with a man.  Unconsciousness, however, is not a  working quality which can be relied upon for staying power; the approach  to the trysting-place brought once more home to her the strange nature of  her enterprise.  She had made up her mind to it; there was no use in  deceiving herself.  What she had undertaken to do was much more  unconventional than being first at a meeting.  It was foolish and weak to  delay.  The last thought braced her up; and it was with a hurried gait,  which alone would have betrayed her to an intelligent observer, that she  entered the grove.          CHAPTER XI--THE MEETING      Had Stephen been better acquainted with men and women, she would have  been more satisfied with herself for being the first at the tryst.  The  conventional idea, in the minds of most women and of all men, is that a  woman should never be the first.  But real women, those in whom the heart  beats strong, and whose blood can leap, know better.  These are the  commanders of men.  In them sex calls to sex, all unconsciously at first;  and men answer to their call, as they to men's.    Two opposite feelings strove for dominance as Stephen found herself on  the"]]]
