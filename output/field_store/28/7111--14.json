'O goddess,' the people cried, 'come to us! Punish the wicked dragon!'    [Illustration]    \"The goddess was angry that one of her creatures should have dared to  harm the little child, and she called aloud, 'Dragon, come to me.' The  dragon came in a moment, for he did not dare to stay away. Then said the  goddess, 'You shall never again play merrily in the water with the  happy sea-animals. You shall be a rocky island. There shall be trees and  plants on you, and before many years have gone, people will no longer  remember that you were once an animal.'    \"The dragon found that he could no longer move about as he had done, for  he was changing into rock. Trees and plants grew on his back. He was an  island, and when people looked at it, they said, 'That island was once a  wicked dragon.' The children of the sea and the children of the land  often went to the island, and there they had very happy times together.\"    This is the story that the mothers tell to their children when they look  at the vases and see the picture of the goddess changing a dragon into  an island. But when the children say, \"Mother, where is the island?  Cannot we go to it and play with the sea-children?\" the mother answers,  \"Oh, this was all a long, long time ago, and no one can tell now where  the island was.\"          WHY THE WATER IN RIVERS IS NEVER STILL.      All kinds of strange things came to pass in the days of long ago, but  perhaps the strangest of all was that the nurses who cared for little  children were not women, but brooks and rivers. The children and the  brooks ran about together, and the brooks and rivers never said, \"It is  time to go to bed,\" for they liked to play as well as the children, and  perhaps a little better. Sometimes the brooks ran first and the children  followed. Sometimes the children ran first and the brooks followed. Of  course, if any animal came near that would hurt the children, the brook  or river in whose care they were left flowed quickly around them, so  that they stood on an island and were safe from all harm.    Two little boys lived in those days who were sons of the king. When the  children were old enough to run about, the king called the rivers and  brooks to come before him. They came gladly, for they felt sure that  something pleasant would happen, and they waited so quietly that no one  would have thought they were so full of frolic.    \"I have called you,\" said the king, \"to give you the care of my two  little sons. They like so well to run about that one nurse will not be  enough to care for them, and of course it will be pleasanter for them to  have many playmates. So I felt that it would be better to ask every  river and every brook to see that they are not hurt or lost.\"    \"We shall have the king's sons for our playmates!\" whispered the rivers.  \"Nothing so pleasant ever happened to us before.\"    But the king went on, \"If you keep my boys safely and well, and follow  them so closely that they are not lost, then I will give you whatever  gift you wish; but if I find that you have forgotten them one moment and  they are lost or hurt, then you will be punished as no river was ever  punished before.\"    The rivers and even the most frolicsome little brooks were again quiet  for a moment. Then they all cried together, \"O king, we will be good.  There were never better nurses than we will be to your sons.\"    At first all went well, and the playmates had the merriest times that  could be thought of. Then came a day when the sunshine was very warm,  but the boys ran faster and farther than boys had ever run in the world  before, and even the brooks could not keep up with them. The rivers had  never been weary before, but when this warm day came, one river after  another had some reason for being quiet. One complained, \"I have  followed the boys farther than any other river.\" \"Perhaps you have,\"  said another, \"but I have been up and down and round and round till I  have forgotten how it seems to be quiet.\" Another declared, \"I have run  about long enough, and I shall run no more.\" A little brook said, \"If I  were a great river, perhaps I could run farther,\" and a great river  replied, \"If I were a little brook, of course I could run farther.\"    So they talked, and the day passed. Night came before they knew it, and  they could not find the boys.    \"Where are my sons?\" cried the king.    \"Indeed, we do not know,\" answered the brooks and rivers in great fear,  and each one looked at the others.    \"You have lost my children,\" said the king, \"and if you do not find  them, you shall be punished. Go and search for them.\"    \"Please help us,\" the rivers begged of the trees and plants, and  everything that had life began to search for the lost boys. \"Perhaps  they are under ground,\" thought the trees, and they sent their roots  down into the earth. \"Perhaps they are in the east,\" cried one animal,  and he went to the east. \"They may be on the mountain,\" said one plant,  and so it climbed to the very top of the mountain. \"They may be in the  village,\" said another, and so that one crept up close to the homes of  men.    Many years passed. The king was almost broken-hearted, but he knew it  was of no use to search longer, so he called very sadly, \"Search no  longer. Let each plant and animal make its home where it is. The little  plant that has crept up the mountain shall live on the mountain top, and  the roots of the trees shall stay under ground. The rivers\"--Then the  king stopped, and the rivers trembled. They knew that they would be  punished, but what would the punishment be? The king looked at them. \"As  for you, rivers and brooks,\" he declared, \"it was your work to watch my  boys. The plants and trees shall find rest and live happily in their  homes, but you shall ever search for my lost boys, and you shall never  have a home.\"    So from that day to this the rivers have gone on looking for the lost  children. They never stop, and some of them are so troubled that they  flow first one way and then the other.          HOW THE RAVEN HELPED MEN.      The raven and the eagle were cousins, and they were almost always  friendly, but whenever they talked together about men, they quarreled.    \"Men are lazy,\" declared the eagle. \"There is no use in trying to help  them. The more one does for them, the less they do for themselves.\"    \"You fly so high,\" said the raven, \"that you cannot see how hard men  work. I think that we birds, who know so much more than they, ought to  help them.\"    \"They do not work,\" cried the eagle. \"What have they to do, I should  like to know? They walk about on the ground, and their food grows close  by their nests. If they had to fly through the air as we do, and get  their food wherever they could, they might talk about working hard.\"    \"That is just why we ought to help them,\" replied the raven. \"They  cannot mount up into the air as we do. They cannot see anything very  well unless it is near them, and if they had to run and catch their  food, they would surely die of hunger. They are poor, weak creatures,  and there is not a humming-bird that does not know many things that they  never heard of.\"    \"You are a poor, weak bird, if you think you can teach men. When they  feel hunger, they will eat, and they do not know how to do anything  else. Just look at them! They ought to be going to sleep, and they do  not know enough to do even that.\"    \"How can they know that it is night, when they have no sun and no moon  to tell them when it is day and when it is night?\"    \"They would not go to sleep even if they had two moons,\" said the eagle;  \"and you are no true cousin of mine if you do not let them alone.\"    So the two birds quarreled. Almost every time they met, they quarreled  about men, and at last, whenever the eagle began to mount into the air,  the raven went near the earth.    Now the eagle had a pretty daughter. She and the raven were good  friends, and they never quarreled about men. One day the pretty daughter  said, \"Cousin Raven, are you too weak to fly as high as you used to do?\"    \"I never was less weak,\" declared the raven.    \"Almost every day you keep on the ground. Can you not mount into the  air?\"    \"Of course I can,\" answered the raven.    \"There are some strange things in my father's lodge,\" said the pretty  daughter, \"and I do not know what they are. They are not good to eat,  and I do not see what else they are good for. Will you come and see  them?\"    \"I will go wherever you ask me,\" declared the raven.    The eagle's lodge was far up on the top of a high mountain, but the two  birds were soon there, and the pretty daughter showed the raven the  strange things. He knew what they were, and he said to himself, \"Men  shall have them, and by and by they will be no less wise than the  birds.\" Then he asked, \"Has your father a magic cloak?\"    [Illustration]    \"Yes,\" answered the pretty daughter.    \"May I put it on?\"    \"Yes, surely.\"    When the raven had once put on the magic cloak, he seized the strange  things and put them under it. Then he called, \"I will come again soon,  my pretty little cousin, and tell you all about the people on the  earth.\"    The things under his cloak were strange indeed, for one was the sun, and  one was the moon. There were hundreds of bright stars, and there were  brooks and rivers and waterfalls. Best of all, there was the precious  gift of fire. The raven put the sun high up in the heavens, and fastened  the moon and stars in their places. He let the brooks run down the sides  of the mountains, and he hid the fire away in the rocks.    After a while men found all these precious gifts. They knew when it was  night and when it was day, and they learned how to use fire. They cannot  mount into the air like the eagle, but in some things they are almost as  wise as the birds.          THE STORY OF THE "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22430"],[0,"Evolution in Modern Thought (#14)"],[1,"occurrence or absence in nearly related species, we may conclude  that fragrance is a relatively _modern_ acquirement, more recent than  brilliant colouring.    One thing in particular that stamps decorative colouring as a product  of selection is _its gradual intensification_ by the addition of new  spots, which we can quite well observe, because in many cases the  colours have been first acquired by the males, and later transmitted  to the females by inheritance. The scent-scales are never thus  transmitted, probably for the same reason that the decorative colours  of many birds are often not transmitted to the females: because with  these they would be exposed to too great elimination by enemies.  Wallace was the first to point out that in species with concealed  nests the beautiful feathers of the male occurred in the female also,  as in the parrots, for instance, but this is not the case in species  which brood on an exposed nest. In the parrots one can often observe  that the general brilliant colouring of the male is found in the  female, but that certain spots of colour are absent, and these have  probably been acquired comparatively recently by the male and have not  yet been transmitted to the female.    Isolation of the group of individuals which is in process of varying  is undoubtedly of great value in sexual selection, for even a solitary  conspicuous variation will become dominant much sooner in a small  isolated colony, than among a large number of members of a species.    Any one who agrees with me in deriving variations from germinal  selection will regard that process as an essential aid towards  explaining the selection of distinctive courtship-characters, such as  coloured spots, decorative feathers, horny outgrowths in birds and  reptiles, combs, feather-tufts, and the like, since the beginnings of  these would be presented with relative frequency in the struggle  between the determinants within the germ-plasm. The process of  transmission of decorative feathers to the female results, as Darwin  pointed out and illustrated by interesting examples, in the  _colour-transformation of a whole species_, and this process, as the  phyletically older colouring of young birds shows, must, in the course  of thousands of years, have repeated itself several times in a line of  descent.    If we survey the wealth of phenomena presented to us by secondary  sexual characters, we can hardly fail to be convinced of the truth of  the principle of sexual selection. And certainly no one who has  accepted natural selection should reject sexual selection, for, not  only do the two processes rest upon the same basis, but they merge  into one another, so that it is often impossible to say how much of a  particular character depends on one and how much on the other form of  selection.      (_b_) _Natural Selection_    An actual proof of the theory of sexual selection is out of the  question, if only because we cannot tell when a variation attains to  selection-value. It is certain that a delicate sense of smell is of  value to the male moth in his search for the female, but whether the  possession of one additional olfactory hair, or of ten, or of twenty  additional hairs leads to the success of its possessor we are unable  to tell. And we are groping even more in the dark when we discuss the  excitement caused in the female by agreeable perfumes, or by striking  and beautiful colours. That these do make an impression is beyond  doubt; but we can only assume that slight intensifications of them  give any advantage, and we _must_ assume this _since otherwise  secondary sexual characters remain inexplicable_.    The same thing is true in regard to natural selection. It is not  possible to bring forward any actual proof of the selection-value of  the initial stages, and the stages in the increase of variations, as  has been already shown. But the selection-value of a finished  adaptation can in many cases be statistically determined. Cesnola and  Poulton have made valuable experiments in this direction. The former  attached forty-five individuals of the green, and sixty-five of the  brown variety of the praying mantis (_Mantis religiosa_), by a silk  thread to plants, and watched them for seven days. The insects which  were on a surface of a colour Similar to their own remained uneaten,  while twenty-five green insects on brown parts of plants had all  disappeared in eleven days.    The experiments of Poulton and Sanders[45] were made with 600 pupae of  _Vanessa urticae_, the \"tortoise-shell butterfly.\" The pupae were  artificially attached to nettles, tree-trunks, fences, walls, and to  the ground, some at Oxford, some at St. Helens in the Isle of Wight.  In the course of a month 93% of the pupae at Oxford were killed,  chiefly by small birds, while at St. Helens 68% perished. The  experiments showed very clearly that the colour and character of the  surface on which the pupa rests--and thus its own conspicuousness--are  of the greatest importance. At Oxford only the four pupae which were  fastened to nettles emerged; all the rest--on bark, stones and the  like--perished. At St. Helens the elimination was as follows: on  fences where the pupae were conspicuous, 92%; on bark, 66%; on walls,  54%; and among nettles, 57%. These interesting experiments confirm our  views as to protective coloration, and show further, _that the ratio  of elimination in the species is a very high one, and that therefore  selection must be very keen_.    We may say that the process of selection follows as a logical  necessity from the fulfilment of the three preliminary postulates of  the theory: variability, heredity, and the struggle for existence,  with its enormous ratio of elimination in all species. To this we must  add a fourth factor, the _intensification_ of variations which Darwin  established as a fact, and which we are now able to account for  theoretically on the basis of germinal selection. It may be objected  that there is considerable uncertainty about this _logical_ proof,  because of our inability to demonstrate the selection-value of the  initial stages and the individual stages of increase. We have  therefore to fall back on _presumptive evidence_. This is to be found  in _the interpretative value of the theory_. Let us consider this  point in greater detail.    In the first place it is necessary to emphasize what is often  overlooked, namely, that the theory not only explains the  _transformations_ of species, it also explains _their remaining the  same_; in addition to the principle of varying, it contains within  itself that of _persisting_. It is part of the essence of selection,  that it not only causes a part to _vary_ till it has reached its  highest pitch of adaptation, but that it _maintains it at this pitch.  This conserving influence of natural selection_ is of great  importance, and was early recognised by Darwin; it follows naturally  from the principle of the survival of the fittest.    We understand from this how it is that a species which has become  fully adapted to certain conditions of life ceases to vary, but  remains \"constant,\" as long as the conditions of life _for_ it remain  unchanged, whether this be for thousands of years, or for whole  geological epochs. But the most convincing proof of the power of the  principle of selection lies in the innumerable multitude of phenomena  which cannot be explained in any other way. To this category belong  all structures which are only _passively_ of advantage to the  organism, because none of these can have arisen by the alleged  _Lamarckian principle_. These have been so often discussed that we  need do no more than indicate them here. Until quite recently the  sympathetic coloration of animals--for instance, the whiteness of  Arctic animals--was referred, at least in part, to the _direct_  influence of external factors, but the facts can best be explained by  referring them to the processes of selection, for then it is  unnecessary to make the gratuitous assumption that many species are  sensitive to the stimulus of cold and that others are not. The great  majority of Arctic land-animals, mammals and birds, are white, and  this proves that they were all able to present the variation which was  most useful for them. The sable is brown, but it lives in trees, where  the brown colouring protects and conceals it more effectively. The  musk-sheep (_Ovibos moschatus_) is also brown, and contrasts sharply  with the ice and snow, but it is protected from beasts of prey by its  gregarious habit, and therefore it is of advantage to be visible from  as great a distance as possible. That so many species have been able  to give rise to white varieties does not depend on a special  sensitiveness of the skin to the influence of cold, but to the fact  that Mammals and Birds have a general tendency to vary towards white.  Even with us, many birds--starlings, blackbirds, swallows,  etc.--occasionally produce white individuals, but the white variety  does not persist, because it readily falls a victim to the carnivores.  This is true of white fawns, foxes, deer, etc. The whiteness,  therefore, arises from internal causes, and only persists when it is  useful. A great many animals living in a _green environment_ have  become clothed in green, especially insects, caterpillars, and  Mantidae, both persecuted and persecutors.    That it is not the direct effect of the environment which calls forth  the green colour is shown by the many kinds of caterpillar which rest  on leaves and feed on them, but are nevertheless brown. These feed by  night and betake themselves through the day to the trunk of the tree,  and hide in the furrows of the bark. We cannot, however, conclude  from this that they were _unable_ to vary towards green, for there are  Arctic animals which are white only in winter and brown in summer  (Alpine hare, and the ptarmigan of the Alps), and there are"]]]
