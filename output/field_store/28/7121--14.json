Now I will suggest the reading, not merely of separate authors,  but of a group. There are many such, of varying degrees of greatness:  the Elizabethan group, the Lake poets, the Byron-Shelley-Keats group,  the mid-nineteenth-century British novelists, to go no further than  writers in English. But I am going to ask your interest in the New  England group of authors who were writing fifty years ago. They comprise  the well-known names of Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Whittier,  Holmes, Thoreau, and Lowell. Each of these delightful writers deserves  to be studied for his own sake, but, if we take them as a group, we  shall gain still more in understanding and profit. How shall we approach  the reading of them? They obviously cannot all be read at once; so let  us begin with any one, say Hawthorne, read his life in Mrs. Field's  brief Beacon Biography, dipping at the same time into his \"Note-Books,\"  and then read some of his short stories and the \"Scarlet Letter.\" His  biography will already have brought us into contact with most of the  other names, of Longfellow, his college classmate, and of Emerson and  Thoreau, his neighbors at Concord. We may read the Beacon Biography of  Longfellow, but Higginson's would be better, as fuller and more  adequate. We may first read Longfellow's prose works, \"Outre-Mer\" and  \"Hyperion,\" and then his \"Voices of the Night,\" besides following him in  his \"Life, with Extracts from his Journal and Correspondence,\" edited by  his brother, which is one of the most delightful of books. We shall do  well to read each author's writings in chronological succession; so they  will stand in orderly relation with his life. Similarly we may take up  Emerson first in Mr. Sanborn's Beacon Biography, or in Dr. Holmes's  larger but still handy volume, and then we can apply ourselves with  better understanding to Emerson's essays and poems. I particularly  mention his poems, for I believe that Emerson will come to be rated  higher as a poet than he has yet been. His poetry at its best is hardly  below anyone's best; the only trouble is that there is so little of it;  but ultimately all writers are judged by their best. In the same way we  may take up all the writers of the group, learning something of the life  of each and reading some of his works before passing on to another. Let  me especially call your attention to the writings of Thoreau, who is  less known to his countrymen than any of the others. He is a writer of  great originality and freshness of view. He, too, wrote some exquisite  poetry, worthy of any name in literature; but you will have to look for  it among other verse that has more originality than charm. Obviously  what I have recommended is not the work of one year's leisure, but the  protracted delight of many years: for these books are not to be hurried  over to get to the end of the chapter or to see how they are coming out;  neither are they material for skipping. They are to be read attentively  and reread; and if one or another fails to make a strong appeal to some  reader, surely he cannot fail to find in most of them a source of lofty  pleasure and spiritual enrichment. One fruit that we may expect from  such reading is that we shall find ourselves drawn nearer to the supreme  masters and shall end by surrendering ourselves to them. To know our New  England group is not indeed to climb the Alps of literature, but it is  at least to climb its White Mountains. Every gain will be a fresh  incitement, and those who at the start join the literary Appalachian  Club may be looked for some day in the ranks of the Alpinists.    A word on the reading of contemporary writers; for even our second list  did not bring us down to our own time. We shall, of course, read our  contemporaries, and we have a right to, so long as we do not give them  the time and attention that clearly belong to their betters. The truth  is that contemporaries--unless they are contemporary poets--have a quite  unfair advantage over their elders, our own in time and place being so  much more attractive to us than anything more remote. Still, our  contemporaries have a claim upon us--even, I am rash enough to assert,  our contemporary poets--for they have a message that their predecessors  cannot give us; it may not be the most important message for us, but it  is a message of value, as we shall see if we return to De Morgan and his  novels. These remarkable books we cannot miss without losing something  that makes our own day fine and precious among earth's generations. But  in this respect they are literally chosen from ten thousand, for we need  constantly the caution that the near carries with it an appearance of  importance that is an illusion; of this truth our periodical literature,  from the newspaper up, is the illustrious example, and the lesson is all  summed up in the one phrase, \"back number.\" Let us be careful that in  heeding contemporary voices we are not storing our minds with the  contents of \"back numbers.\" True literature as we have seen, never  becomes out of date; Homer keeps up with the telegraph.    I have but one final word, which has been provided for me by Charles  Lamb, who says in his inimitable fashion: \"I own that I am disposed to  say grace upon twenty other occasions in the course of the day besides  my dinner. I want a form for setting out upon a pleasant walk, for a  moonlight ramble, for a friendly meeting, or a solved problem. Why have  we none for books, those spiritual repasts--a grace before Milton--a  grace before Shakespeare--a devotional exercise proper to be said before  reading the Fairy Queen?\" This is the spirit of a joyous but devoutly  grateful expectance, in which I would have myself approach the reading  of a great book. The gratitude I surely owe the author, for there is no  great book but has come like refined gold out of the furnace fire. I owe  it also to the Providence which has granted me this lofty privilege.  Moreover, it is only in the humility born of such an attitude that I can  make a complete approach to my author and gain that uplift and  enrichment of the soul, which--and not pastime nor pleasure--is the true  end, as it should be the aim of reading.          THE BACKGROUND OF THE BOOK      One of the greatest contributions that modern investigation has made to  human knowledge is background. It was once thought a remarkable  achievement to uncover the historic background of modern institutions,  and this was all that, until lately, scholarship attempted. Dr. Samuel  Johnson confidently remarked that we know no more about ancient Britain  than the old writers have told us, nor can we ever know any more than  this. Edward Clodd reminds us that at the very time when the great  oracle voiced this assertion discoveries had already been made in  England that, when interpreted as they have been since, were to make the  landing of Caesar seem, by comparison, a contemporary occurrence. Now  this inconceivably remote prehistoric era furnishes not merely  arrowheads and stone chisels and burial mounds, but also other objects  that are the background of that \"picture of time\" of which the book of  to-day is the foreground.    Very properly these are objects of art, and they afford the earliest  illustrations in histories of art as they do in histories of the book.  Thus the printer who questions what art has to do with his business  stamps himself as two hundred thousand years behind the times. They are  pictures, and the book of to-day has descended as directly from them as  the printer of to-day has descended from the man who made them. They  are, moreover, in some instances, works of very high art. The picture of  the mammoth, scratched on a fragment of the mammoth's tusk, is a piece  of drawing so skillful that only the greatest living masters can equal  it. Not even Rembrandt's drawing of the elephant, which Dr. Holmes  celebrates in one of his poems, is more expressive or wrought with more  economy of effort. In the same district of southwestern France,  Dordogne, that yielded the drawings are found long cave galleries of  paintings representing the creatures of that period, all executed with  great spirit and ability. But what are the steps in the descent from  these ancient pictures to the printed book?    Primitive man had one more string to his conversational bow than most  civilized people have, namely, sign language. But gesture and speech  alike prevail but little against space and time. Each is possible only  at short range, and each dies on the eye or ear that receives it.  Pictures may be carried to any distance and may be preserved for any  length of time. They were probably made first in response to an instinct  rather for art than for the communication of ideas; but their great  advantage for communication must have been perceived very early, and, as  we find picture writing employed by primitive races to-day, we have the  right to infer that prehistoric peoples at the same stage of culture  also employed it. Pure picture writing, however, does not suffice for  all that men have to say. It is easy to represent a house, but how shall  we represent a home? It is easy to represent a woman, but how shall we  add the idea of wife? To do this we must pass from simple pictures to  symbols. Chinese writing has never advanced beyond this stage. Its  prodigious type-case of more than forty-two thousand characters  contains, therefore, only a series of pictures, direct and symbolic, all  highly conventionalized, but recognizable in their earlier forms. To  represent \"wife\" the Chinaman combines the two signs for \"woman\" and  \"broom\"; to represent \"home\" he makes a picture of a pig under a roof!  The Egyptian and Mexican systems of writing, though very different to  the eye, were both of this nature and represented ideas rather than  words.

He was for over forty  years a diligent collector, and few days passed in that period which did  not witness an addition to his library. He died at his chambers in  Staple Inn. 'I have been almost daily at a book-auction,' writes  Malone--'the library of the late Mr. Reed, the last Shakespearian,  except myself, where my purse has been drained as usual. But what I have  purchased are chiefly books of my own trade. There is hardly a library  of this kind now left, except my own and Mr. Bindley's, neither of us  having the least desire to succeed the other in his peculiar species of  literary wealth.'    [Illustration: _St. Bernard's Seal._]      FOOTNOTES:    [27:A] In Hearne's 'Diary,' published by the Oxford Historical Society,  there is a very quaint note about the Duke of Lauderdale, who is  described as 'a Curious Collector of Books, and when in London would  very often go to y{e} Booksellers shops and pick up w{t} curious Books  he could meet with; but y{t} in his Elder years he lost much of his  Learning by minding too much Politicks.'    [27:B] At the Cambridge University Library there are some very  interesting diaries of this famous book-lover, styled 'Father of Black  Letter Collectors,' chiefly relating to the purchases of books. All the  more important facts have been published in the pages of the  _Bibliographer_.          [Illustration]    FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW.      I.    IN few phases of human action are the foibles and preferences of  individuals more completely imbricated than in that of book-collecting.  Widely different as were the book-hunters' fancies at the beginning and  at the end of the eighteenth century, yet it would not be possible to  draw a hard and fast line. For the greater part of that time the  classics of every description and of every degree of unimportance held  their own. Reluctant, therefore, to abandon the chief stimulant of their  earlier book-hunting careers, many collectors still took a keen interest  in their _primi pensieri_. But their real passion found a vent in other  and less beaten directions. In addition to this, during the eighteenth  century a large number of small working libraries were formed by men who  _used_ books. Henry Fielding, Goldsmith, Dr. Johnson, David Hume,  Smollett, Gibbon, Pope, and many others, are essentially figures in the  history of book-hunting in London, but they had neither the means nor,  so far as we are aware, the inclination to indulge in book-collecting as  a mere fashionable hobby. Mr. Austin Dobson has lately published an  interesting account of Fielding's library, in which he proves not only  that Fielding had been a fervent student of the classics in his youth  and that he remained a voracious reader through life, but that he made  good use of a large collection of Greek and Latin authors, which was  sold at his death.    [Illustration: _Mr. Austin Dobson._    From a photograph by E. C. Porter, Ealing.]    The eighteenth century may be regarded as the Augustan age so far as  book-hunting in London is concerned. A large percentage of the most  famous collections were either formed, or the collectors themselves were  either born or died, in that period. The Beckford and Hamilton, the  Heber, the Sunderland, the Althorp, and the King's Library, all had  their origins prior to 1800.    Richard Heber (1773-1833), with all his vast knowledge, learning, and  accomplishments, was a bibliomaniac in the more unpleasant sense of the  word. No confirmed drunkard, no incurable opium-eater, ever had less  self-control than Heber had. To him, to see a book was to possess it.  Cicero has said that the heart into which the love of gold has entered  is shut to every other feeling. Heber was very wealthy, so that with him  the love of books blinded him to almost everything else. He began to  collect when at Oxford, chiefly classics for the purpose of study. He is  said to have caught the disease from Bindley, the veteran collector, who  began book-hunting early in the last century. Having one day  accidentally met with a copy of Henry Peacham's 'Valley of Varietie,'  1638, which professed to give 'rare passages out of antiquity,' etc., he  showed it to Bindley, who described it as 'rather a curious book.' Why  such an incident should have set Heber on his terrible career history  telleth not. Under the name of 'Atticus,' Dibdin, who knew Heber well,  has described him in this fashion: 'Atticus unites all the activity of  De Witt and Lomenie, with the retentiveness of Magliabechi, and the  learning of Le Long. . . . Yet Atticus doth sometimes sadly err. He has  now and then an ungovernable passion to possess more copies of a book  than there were ever parties to a deed or stamina to a plant;  and therefore, I cannot call him a \"duplicate\" or a triplicate  collector. . . . But he atones for this by being liberal in the loan of  his volumes. The learned and curious, whether rich or poor, have always  free access to his library.' Heber's own explanation of this plurality  of purchase was cast somewhat in this fashion: 'Why, you see, sir, no  man can comfortably do without _three_ copies of a book. One he must  have for his show copy, and he will probably keep it at his country  house. Another he will require for his own use and reference; and unless  he is inclined to part with this, which is very inconvenient, or risk  the injury of his best copy, he must needs have a third at the service  of his friends.' The late Mr. Edward Solly was also a pluralist in the  matter of books, and had even six or seven copies of a large number of  works. He justified himself on the plea that he liked to have one to  read, one to make notes in, another with notes by a previous owner, one  in a choice binding, a 'tall' copy, a short ditto, and so forth. So far,  however, as Heber is concerned, no one could be more generous than he in  lending books. This might be proved from a dozen different sources,  including the lengthy introduction 'To Richard Heber, Esq.,' to the  sixth canto of Scott's 'Marmion':         'But why such instances to you,        Who, in an instant, can renew        Your treasured hoards of various lore,        And furnish twenty thousand more?        Hoards, not like theirs whose volumes rest        Like treasures in the Franch'mont chest,        While gripple owners still refuse        To others what they cannot use:        Give them the priest's whole century,        They shall not spell you letters three;        Their pleasure in the books the same        The magpie takes in pilfer'd gem.        Thy volumes, open as thy heart,        Delight, amusement, science, art,        To every ear and eye impart;        Yet who of all who thus employ them,        Can, like their owner's self, enjoy them?'    In addition to this reference, Scott, in one of his letters, speaks of  'Heber the magnificent, whose library and cellar are so superior to all  others in the world.' Frequent mention is made of Heber in the notes to  the Waverley novels. At one period of his life Heber was a Member of  Parliament, and throughout his career it seems that he found recreation  from the sport of collecting in the sport of the fields. He has been  known to take a journey of four or five hundred miles to obtain a rare  volume, 'fearful to trust to a mere commission.' He bought by all  methods, in all places, and at all times, a single purchase on one  occasion being an entire library of 30,000 volumes. Curiously enough, he  disliked large-paper copies, on account of the space they filled. When  he died, he had eight houses full of books--two in London, one in  Oxford, and others at Paris, Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent, besides  smaller collections in Germany. When sold, the number of lots was  52,000, and of volumes about 147,000, and the total amount realized  L57,000, or about two-thirds of the original expenditure. The sale,  which commenced in 1834, lasted over several years, and the catalogue  alone comprises six thick octavo volumes. He is described as a tall,  strong, well-made man.    Writing to Sir Egerton Brydges, the Rev. A. Dyce observes concerning  Heber's death: 'Poor man! He expired at Pimlico,[47:A] in the midst of  his rare property, without a friend to close his eyes, and from all I  have heard I am led to believe that he died broken-hearted. He had been  ailing some time, but took no care of himself, and seemed, indeed, to  court death. Yet his ruling passion was strong to the last. The morning  he died he wrote out some memoranda for Thorpe about books which he  wished to be purchased for him' (Fitzgerald, 'The Book-Fancier,' p.  230).    In noticing Scott's edition of Dryden, and in alluding to the help which  Scott obtained from Heber and Bindley, the _Edinburgh Review_ speaks of  the two as 'gentlemen in whom the love of collecting, which is an  amusement to others, assumes the dignity of a virtue, because it gives  ampler scope to the exercise of friendship, and of a generous sympathy  with the common cause of literature.'    [Illustration: _William Beckford, Book-collector._]    William Beckford (1761-1844) and the tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767-1852),  for several reasons, may be bracketed together as book-collectors. Each  was a remarkable man in several respects. William Beckford, the author  of 'Vathek' and the owner of Fonthill, was a universal collector. No  less enthusiastic in amassing pictures and objects of art than books,  he never scrupled to sell anything and everything except his books,  which he dearly loved. A man who could draw eulogy from Byron could not  have been an ordinary person. Fonthill and its treasures were announced  for sale in September, 1822, the auctioneer being James Christie, the  catalogue being in quarto size, and comprising ninety-five pages. The  auction, however, did not take place, but the collection was sold _en  masse_ to a Mr. John Farquhar for L330,000,"]]]
