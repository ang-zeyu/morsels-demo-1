Constant and pious, blest by fate,  The right thou must not violate.  Thou, Raghu's son, so famous through  The triple world as just and true,  Perform thy bounden duty still,  Nor stain thy race by deed of ill.  If thou have sworn and now refuse  Thou must thy store of merit lose.  Then, Monarch, let thy Rama go,  Nor fear for him the demon foe.  The fiends shall have no power to hurt  Him trained to war or inexpert,  Nor vanquish him in battle field,  For Kusik's son the youth will shield.  He is incarnate Justice, he  The best of men for bravery.  Embodied love of penance drear,  Among the wise without a peer.  Full well he knows, great Kusik's son,  The arms celestial, every one,  Arms from the Gods themselves concealed,  Far less to other men revealed.  These arms to him, when earth he swayed,  Mighty Krisasva, pleased, conveyed.  Krisasva's sons they are indeed,  Brought forth by Daksha's lovely seed,(146)  Heralds of conquest, strong and bold,  Brilliant, of semblance manifold.  Jaya and Vijaya, most fair,  And hundred splendid weapons bare.  Of Jaya, glorious as the morn,  First fifty noble sons were born,  Boundless in size yet viewless too,  They came the demons to subdue.  And fifty children also came  Of Vijaya the beauteous dame,  Sanharas named, of mighty force,  Hard to assail or check in course.  Of these the hermit knows the use,  And weapons new can he produce.  All these the mighty saint will yield  To Rama's hand, to own and wield;  And armed with these, beyond a doubt  Shall Rama put those fiends to rout.  For Rama and the people's sake,  For thine own good my counsel take,  Nor seek, O King, with fond delay,  The parting of thy son to stay.\"          Canto XXIV. The Spells.        Vasishtha thus was speaking still:  The monarch, of his own free will,  Bade with quick zeal and joyful cheer  Rama and Lakshman hasten near.  Mother and sire in loving care  Sped their dear son with rite and prayer:  Vasishtha blessed him ere he went;  O'er his loved head the father bent,  And then to Kusik's son resigned  Rama with Lakshman close behind.  Standing by Visvamitra's side,  The youthful hero, lotus-eyed,  The Wind-God saw, and sent a breeze  Whose sweet pure touch just waved the trees.  There fell from heaven a flowery rain,  And with the song and dance the strain  Of shell and tambour sweetly blent  As forth the son of Raghu went.  The hermit led: behind him came  The bow-armed Rama, dear to fame,  Whose locks were like the raven's wing:(147)  Then Lakshman, closely following.  The Gods and Indra, filled with joy,  Looked down upon the royal boy,  And much they longed the death to see  Of their ten-headed enemy.(148)  Rama and Lakshman paced behind  That hermit of the lofty mind,  As the young Asvins,(149) heavenly pair,  Follow Lord Indra through the air.  On arm and hand the guard they wore,  Quiver and bow and sword they bore;  Two fire-born Gods of War seemed they.(150)  He, Siva's self who led the way.      Upon fair Sarju's southern shore  They now had walked a league and more,  When thus the sage in accents mild  To Rama said: \"Beloved child,  This lustral water duly touch:  My counsel will avail thee much.  Forget not all the words I say,  Nor let the occasion slip away.  Lo, with two spells I thee invest,  The mighty and the mightiest.  O'er thee fatigue shall ne'er prevail,  Nor age or change thy limbs assail.  Thee powers of darkness ne'er shall smite  In tranquil sleep or wild delight.  No one is there in all the land  Thine equal for the vigorous hand.  Thou, when thy lips pronounce the spell,  Shalt have no peer in heaven or hell.  None in the world with thee shall vie,  O sinless one, in apt reply,  In fortune, knowledge, wit, and tact,  Wisdom to plan and skill to act.  This double science take, and gain  Glory that shall for aye remain.  Wisdom and judgment spring from each  Of these fair spells whose use I teach.  Hunger and thirst unknown to thee,  High in the worlds thy rank shall be.  For these two spells with might endued,  Are the Great Father's heavenly brood,  And thee, O Chief, may fitly grace,  Thou glory of Kakutstha's race.  Virtues which none can match are thine,  Lord, from thy birth, of gifts divine,  And now these spells of might shall cast  Fresh radiance o'er the gifts thou hast.\"  Then Rama duly touched the wave,    Raised suppliant hands, bowed low his head,  And took the spells the hermit gave,    Whose soul on contemplation fed.  From him whose might these gifts enhanced,  A brighter beam of glory glanced:  So shines in all his autumn blaze  The Day-God of the thousand rays.  The hermit's wants those youths supplied,  As pupils use to holy guide.  And then the night in sweet content  On Sarju's pleasant bank they spent.          Canto XXV. The Hermitage Of Love.      Soon as appeared the morning light  Up rose the mighty anchorite,  And thus to youthful Rama said,  Who lay upon his leafy bed:  \"High fate is hers who calls thee son:    Arise, 'tis break of day;  Rise, Chief, and let those rites be done    Due at the morning's ray.\"(151)  At that great sage's high behest    Up sprang the princely pair,  To bathing rites themselves addressed,    And breathed the holiest prayer.  Their morning task completed, they    To Visvamitra came  That store of holy works, to pay    The worship saints may claim.  Then to the hallowed spot they went    Along fair Sarju's side  Where mix her waters confluent    With three-pathed Ganga's tide.(152)  There was a sacred hermitage    Where saints devout of mind  Their lives through many a lengthened age    To penance had resigned.  That pure abode the princes eyed    With unrestrained delight,  And thus unto the saint they cried,    Rejoicing at the sight:  \"Whose is that hermitage we see?    Who makes his dwelling there?  Full of desire to hear are we:    O Saint, the truth declare.\"  The hermit smiling made reply    To the two boys' request:  \"Hear, Rama, who in days gone by    This calm retreat possessed.  Kandarpa in apparent form,    Called Kama(153) by the wise,  Dared Uma's(154) new-wed lord to storm    And make the God his prize.  'Gainst Sthanu's(155) self, on rites austere    And vows intent,(156) they say,  His bold rash hand he dared to rear,    Though Sthanu cried, Away!  But the God's eye with scornful glare    Fell terrible on him.  Dissolved the shape that was so fair    And burnt up every limb.  Since the great God's terrific rage    Destroyed his form and frame,  Kama in each succeeding age    Has borne Ananga's(157) name.  So, where his lovely form decayed,    This land is Anga styled:  Sacred to him of old this shade,    And hermits undefiled.  Here Scripture-talking elders sway    Each sense with firm control,  And penance-rites have washed away    All sin from every soul.  One night, fair boy, we here will spend,    A pure stream on each hand,  And with to-morrow's light will bend    Our steps to yonder strand.  Here let us bathe, and free from stain    To that pure grove repair,  Sacred to Kama, and remain    One night in comfort there.\"  With penance' far-discerning eye    The saintly men beheld  Their coming, and with transport high    Each holy bosom swelled.  To Kusik's son the gift they gave    That honoured guest should greet,  Water they brought his feet to lave,    And showed him honor meet.  Rama and Lakshman next obtained    In due degree their share.  Then with sweet talk the guests remained,    And charmed each listener there.  The evening prayers were duly said    With voices calm and low:  Then on the ground each laid his head    And slept till morning's glow.          Canto XXVI. The Forest Of Tadaka.      When the fair light of morning rose  The princely tamers of their foes  Followed, his morning worship o'er,  The hermit to the river's shore.  The high-souled men with thoughtful care  A pretty barge had stationed there.  All cried, \"O lord, this barge ascend,  And with thy princely followers bend  To yonder side thy prosperous way  With naught to check thee or delay.\"      Nor did the saint their rede reject:  He bade farewell with due respect,  And crossed, attended by the twain,  That river rushing to the main.  When now the bark was half way o'er,  Rama and Lakshman heard the roar,  That louder grew and louder yet,  Of waves by dashing waters met.  Then Rama asked the mighty seer:  \"What is the tumult that I hear  Of waters cleft in mid career?\"  Soon as the speech of Rama, stirred  By deep desire to know, he heard,  The pious saint began to tell  What paused the waters' roar and swell:  \"On high Kailasa's distant hill    There lies a noble lake  Whose waters, born from Brahma's will,    The name of Manas(158) take.  Thence, hallowing where'er they flow,    The streams of Sarju fall,  And wandering through the plains below    Embrace Ayodhya's wall.  Still, still preserved in Sarju's name    Sarovar's(159) fame we trace.  The flood of Brahma whence she came    To run her holy race.  To meet great Ganga here she hies    With tributary wave:  Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,    Of floods that swell and rave.  Here, pride of Raghu's line, do thou  In humble adoration bow.\"      He spoke. The princes both obeyed,  And reverence to each river paid.(160)  They reached the southern shore at last,  And gaily on their journey passed.  A little space beyond there stood  A gloomy awe-inspiring wood.  The monarch's noble son began  To question thus the holy man:  \"Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye  Like some vast cloud that fills the sky?  Pathless and dark it seems to be,  Where birds in thousands wander free;  Where shrill cicadas' cries resound,  And fowl of dismal note abound.  Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,  Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,    There shrubs and thorns run wild:  Dhao, Sal, Bignonia, Bel,(161) are found,  And every tree that grows on ground.    How is the forest styled?\"  The glorious saint this answer made:  \"Dear child"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#14)"],[1,"subject. Then Gussie went on another visit to her friend,  and when she came back so did Rev. Carroll.    One calm, hazy afternoon I was coming slowly up from the mills.  Happening to glance at the kitchen roof, I gasped. It was on fire in  one place. Evidently the dry shingles had caught fire from a spark.  There was not a soul about save Gussie, Aunt Lucy, and myself. I  dashed wildly into the kitchen, where Gussie was peeling apples.    \"The house is on fire,\" I exclaimed. Gussie dropped her knife and  turned pale.    \"Don't wake Mother,\" was all she said, as she snatched a bucket of  water from the table. The ladder was still lying by the well. In a  second I had raised it to the roof and, while Gussie went up it like a  squirrel and dashed the water on the flames, I had two more buckets  ready for her.    Fortunately the fire had made little headway, though a few minutes  more would have given it a dangerous start. The flames hissed and died  out as Gussie threw on the water, and in a few seconds only a small  black hole in the shingles remained. Gussie slid down the ladder. She  trembled in every limb, but she put out her wet hand to me with a  faint, triumphant smile. We shook hands across the ladder with a  cordiality never before expressed.    For the next week, in spite of Rev. Carroll, I was happy when I  thought of Gussie and miserable when I thought of Nellie. I held  myself in some way bound to her and--was she not my ideal?  Undoubtedly!    One day I got a letter from my sister. It was long and newsy, and the  eighth page was most interesting.    \"If you don't come home and look after Nellie,\" wrote Kate, \"you'll  soon not have her to look after. You remember that old lover of hers,  Rod Allen? Well, he's home from the west now, immensely rich, they  say, and his attentions to Nellie are the town talk. I think she likes  him too. If you bury yourself any longer at Ashley Mills I won't be  responsible for the consequences.\"    This lifted an immense weight from my mind, but the ninth page hurled  it back again.    \"You never say anything of Miss Ashley in your letters. What is she  like--young or old, ugly or pretty, clever or dull? I met a lady  recently who knows her and thinks she is charming. She also said Miss  Ashley was to be married soon to Rev. Something-or-Other. Is it true?\"    Aye, was it? Quite likely. Kate's letter made a very miserable man of  me. Gussie found me a dull companion that day. After several vain  attempts to rouse me to interest she gave it up.    \"There's no use talking to you,\" she said impatiently. \"I believe you  are homesick. That letter you got this morning looked suspicious.  Anyhow, I hope you'll get over it before I get back.\"    \"Are you going away again?\" I asked.    \"Yes. I am going to stay a few days with Flossie.\" Flossie was that  inseparable chum of hers.    \"You seem to spend a good deal of your time with her,\" I remarked  discontentedly.    Gussie opened her eyes at my tone.    \"Why, of course,\" she said. \"Flossie and I have always been chums. And  she needs me more than ever just now, for she is awfully busy. She is  to be married next month.\"    \"Oh, I see--and you--\"    \"I'm to be bridesmaid, of course, and we've heaps to do. Flossie  wanted to wait until Christmas, but Mr. Martin is in a--\"    \"Mr. Martin,\" I interrupted. \"Is Mr. Martin going to marry your  friend?\"    \"Why, yes. Didn't you know? They just suit each other. There he comes  now. He's going to drive me over, and I'm not ready. Talk to him, for  pity's sake, while I go and dress.\"    I never enjoyed a conversation more. Rev. Carroll Martin was a  remarkably interesting man.    Nellie married Rod Allen at Christmas and I was best man. Nellie made  a charming little bride, and Rod fairly worshipped her. My own wedding  did not come off until spring, as Gussie said she could not get ready  before that.          Kismet      The fifth heat in the free-for-all was just over. \"Lu-Lu\" had won, and  the crowd on the grand stand and the hangers-on around the track were  cheering themselves hoarse. Clear through the noisy clamour shrilled a  woman's cry.    \"Ah--I have dropped my scorecard.\"    A man in front of her turned.    \"I have an extra one, madame. Will you accept it?\"    Her small, modishly-gloved hand closed eagerly on it before she lifted  her eyes to his face. Both started convulsively. The man turned very  pale, but the woman's ripe-tinted face coloured darkly.    \"You?\" she faltered.    His lips parted in the coldly-grave smile she remembered and hated.    \"You are not glad to see me,\" he said calmly, \"but that, I suppose,  was not to be expected. I did not come here to annoy you. This meeting  is as unexpected to me as to you. I had no suspicion that for the last  half-hour I had been standing next to my--\"    She interrupted him by an imperious gesture. Still clutching the  scorecard she half-turned from him. Again he smiled, this time with a  tinge of scorn, and shifted his eyes to the track.    None of the people around them had noticed the little by-play. All  eyes were on the track, which was being cleared for the first heat of  another race. The free-for-all horses were being led away blanketed.  The crowd cheered \"Lu-Lu\" as she went past, a shapeless oddity. The  backers of \"Mascot\", the rival favourite, looked gloomy.    The woman noticed nothing of all this. She was small, very pretty,  still young, and gowned in a quite unmistakable way. She studied the  man's profile furtively. He looked older than when she had seen him  last--there were some silver threads gleaming in his close-clipped  dark hair and short, pointed beard. Otherwise there was little change  in the quiet features and somewhat stern grey eyes. She wondered if he  had cared at all.    They had not met for five years. She shut her eyes and looked in on  her past. It all came back very vividly. She had been eighteen when  they were married--a gay, high-spirited girl and the season's beauty.  He was much older and a quiet, serious student. Her friends had  wondered why she married him--sometimes she wondered herself, but she  had loved him, or thought so.    The marriage had been an unhappy one. She was fond of society and  gaiety, he wanted quiet and seclusion. She Was impulsive and  impatient, he deliberate and grave. The strong wills clashed. After  two years of an unbearable sort of life they had separated--quietly,  and without scandal of any sort. She had wanted a divorce, but he  would not agree to that, so she had taken her own independent fortune  and gone back to her own way of life. In the following five years she  had succeeded in burying all remembrance well out of sight. No one  knew if she were satisfied or not; her world was charitable to her and  she lived a gay and quite irreproachable life. She wished that she had  not come to the races. It was such an irritating encounter. She opened  her eyes wearily; the dusty track, the flying horses, the gay dresses  of the women on the grandstand, the cloudless blue sky, the brilliant  September sunshine, the purple distances all commingled in a glare  that made her head ache. Before it all she saw the tall figure by her  side, his face turned from her, watching the track intently.    She wondered with a vague curiosity what induced him to come to the  races. Such things were not greatly in his line. Evidently their  chance meeting had not disturbed him. It was a sign that he did not  care. She sighed a little wearily and closed her eyes. When the heat  was over he turned to her.    \"May I ask how you have been since--since we met last? You are looking  extremely well. Has Vanity Fair palled in any degree?\"    She was angry at herself and him. Where had her careless society  manner and well-bred composure gone? She felt weak and hysterical.  What if she should burst into tears before the whole crowd--before  those coldly critical grey eyes? She almost hated him.    \"No--why should it? I have found it very pleasant--and I have been  well--very well. And you?\"    He jotted down the score carefully before he replied.    \"I? Oh, a book-worm and recluse always leads a placid life. I never  cared for excitement, you know. I came down here to attend a sale of  some rare editions, and a well-meaning friend dragged me out to see  the races. I find it rather interesting, I must confess, much more so  than I should have fancied. Sorry I can't stay until the end. I must  go as soon as the free-for-all is over, if not before. I have backed  'Mascot'; you?\"    \"'Lu-Lu'\" she answered quickly--it almost seemed defiantly. How  horribly unreal it was--this carrying on of small talk, as if they  were the merest of chance-met acquaintances! \"She belongs to a friend  of mine, so I am naturally interested.\"    \"She and 'Mascot' are ties now--both have won two heats. One more for  either will decide it. This is a good day for the races. Excuse me.\"    He leaned over and brushed a scrap of paper from her grey cloak. She  shivered slightly.    \"You are cold! This stand is draughty.\"    \"I am not at all cold, thank you. What race is this?--oh! the  three-minute one.\"    She bent forward with assumed interest to watch the scoring. She was  breathing heavily. There were tears in her eyes--she bit her lips  savagely and glared at the track until they were gone.    Presently he spoke again, in the low, even tone demanded by  circumstances.    \"This is a curious meeting, is it not?--quite a flavor of romance!  By-the-way, do you read as many novels as ever?\"    She fancied there was mockery in his tone. She remembered how very  frivolous he used to consider her novel-reading. Besides, she resented  the personal tinge. What right had he?    \"Almost as many,\" she answered carelessly.    \"I was very intolerant, wasn't I?\" he said after a pause. \"You thought  so--you were right. You have been happier since you--left me?\"    \"Yes,\" she said defiantly, looking straight into his"]]]
