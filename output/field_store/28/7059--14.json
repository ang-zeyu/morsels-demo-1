Two boundary boats,  one above and one below, were anchored at half a mile distance, and  between these limits the hunt was to take place.  The \"duck\" was  provided with a little punt, about five feet long and pretty wide, in  which he was to escape as best he might from a cutter manned by four  rowers and a coxswain, and carrying in its bows a \"hunter.\"  As long as  he chose, or as long as he could, the duck might dodge his pursuers in  his punt; but when once run down he would have to take to the water, and  by swimming make good his escape from his pursuers, whose \"hunter\" would  be ready at any moment to jump overboard and secure him.  If, however,  after twenty minutes the duck still remained uncaught, he was to be  adjudged winner.    Such was the work cut out for us on this memorable afternoon.  The duck  on the present occasion was a sixth-form fellow called Haigh, one of the  best divers and swimmers in the school, while, as I have already said, I  had been selected to act as hunter on behalf of the fifth.    The duck, arrayed in the slightest of costumes, was not long in putting  in an appearance in his little punt, which, being only five feet long,  was so light that it seemed to jump through the water at every stroke of  the oars; while a single stroke either way sufficed to change its course  in a moment.  The cutter, in the prow of which I (as slenderly attired  as the duck) was stationed, was also a light boat, and of course, with  its four rowers, far swifter than the punt; but when it came to turning  and dodging, it was, because of its length, comparatively unwieldy and  clumsy.    All now was ready for the chase.  The duck was to get a minute's clear  start, and at the signal off he darted up the stream.  The minute seemed  to us in the cutter as if it were never going to end, and we watched  with dismay the pace at which our lively fugitive was \"making tracks.\"    \"Ready all, in the cutter!\" cries the doctor.  \"Off!\" and next moment we  are flying through the water in full cry.  As we gradually pull up to  the duck he diminishes his pace, and finally lies on his oars and coolly  waits for us.    \"Put it on, now!\" calls out our coxswain, and our boat shoots forward.  When within a few yards, the duck, apparently alive to his danger,  dashes his oars into the water and darts ahead.  But we are too fast for  him.  Another two strokes and we shall row him down.    \"Now then!\" cries our coxswain.    Ah!  At a tremendous pace our boat flew forward over the very place  where, a second before, our duck had been.  But where was he?  By a turn  of the hand he had twisted round his punt, and as our fellows dug their  oars wildly into the water and tried to pull up, there was he, calmly  scuttling away in an opposite direction, and laughing at us!    In due time we had swung round, and were after him again, the wiser for  this lesson.    Next time we overhauled him we made our approach in a far more gingerly  manner.  We kept as little way as possible on our boat, determined not  to lose time again by overshooting our mark.  As long as he could, our  duck led us down stream, then, when we had all but caught him, he made a  feint of swooping off to the right, a manoeuvre which our coxswain  promptly followed.  But no sooner was our rudder round than the rogue  deftly brought his punt sharp to the left, and so once more escaped us.    This sort of thing went on for a long time, and I was beginning to think  the hunt was likely to prove a monotonous affair after all, when our  coxswain suddenly called to me down the boat--    \"Be ready, Adams.\"    Then it began gradually to dawn on me our coxswain after all knew what  he was about.  There was a rather deep bay up near the top of the  course, bounded by two prominent little headlands, and into this bay the  duck, in a moment of carelessness, had ventured.  It was a chance not to  be let slip.  A few strokes brought our cutter up to the spot, and once  there, our cunning coxswain carefully kept us pointed exactly across the  bay.  The duck, seeing his danger, made a dash to one corner, hoping to  avoid us; but he was too late, we were there before him, and before he  could double and make the other corner our boat had back-watered to the  spot.  Thus gradually we hemmed him in closer and closer to the shore,  amid the cheers of our friends, until at last it was evident to every  one the punt was no longer of use.    Still, he let us sidle close up to him before he abandoned his craft;  then with a sudden bound he sprang overboard and disappeared from view.    It was no use going after him, I knew, till I could see where he would  rise, and so I waited, ready for a plunge, watching the water where he  would probably turn up.  Several seconds passed, but there were no signs  of him.  He was a good diver, we all knew, but this was surely a very  long dive.  Had an accident happened to him?  A minute elapsed, two, and  yet he never appeared!  We in the boat were aghast; he must have come to  grief.  Ah! what were the people on the bank laughing at?  Could there  be some trick?  Next instant the coxswain called out, laughing--    \"He's hanging on to the rudder; over you go, Adams!\"    At the word I slipped overboard and gave chase.  And now began an  exciting pursuit.  Haigh, though perfectly at home in the water, was not  a rapid swimmer; but in point of diving and dodging he had a tremendous  advantage over any of his pursuers.  The moment I got near him, and just  as I was thinking to grab him, he would disappear suddenly and come up  behind me.  He would dive towards the right and come up towards the  left.  He would dodge me round the boat, or swim round me in circles,  but no effort of mine could secure him.  The time was getting on, and I  was no nearer having him than before.  With all his dodges, too, he  never seemed to take his eyes off me for an instant, either above or  below the water.    Once, as I was giving him chase, he suddenly dived, and the next  intimation I had of his whereabouts was a sly pinch of my big toe as he  came up behind me.  This was adding insult to injury, so I dashed round,  and made at him.  Again he dived; and this time, without waiting an  instant, I dived too.  I could see him distinctly under the water,  scuttling away in a downward direction just below me.  Shutting my lips  tight, I dug my way down after him; but, alas! under water I was no  match for Haigh.  I felt an irresistible temptation to gasp; my nose  smarted, and the water round my head seemed like lead.  As quickly as  possible I turned my hands up, and struck out for the surface.    What ages it seemed before I reached it!  A second--half a second  longer, and I should have shipped a mouthful, perhaps a chestful of  water.  I reached the surface at last, and, once above water, felt all  right again.  I looked about anxiously for my duck.  But he was still  down below.  I reckoned, from the direction in which he had dived, that  he would not be able to go far to either side, and therefore would rise  close to me, probably exhausted, and if so, I had a good chance at last  of catching him.  So I waited and watched the place, but he never came.    Remembering my own sensations, and how nearly I had come to grief, I  took a sudden fright, and concluding he must be in straits down below,  shouted to the boat to come to the place, and then dived.  I groped  about, and looked in all directions, but saw no sign of him, and  finally, in a terrible fright, made once more for the surface.    The first thing I was conscious of, on getting my head up, was a great  shouting and laughing, and then I caught sight of that abominable duck,  who had come up behind me, and had been laughing all the while behind my  back, while I had been hunting for him in a far more serious way than I  need ever have done!    Before I could turn and make towards him \"Time!\" was shouted from the  bank; and so the Parkhurst Swimming Contest ended in a lamentable,  though not disgraceful, defeat of the \"fivers.\"        CHAPTER SEVEN.    ATHLETIC SPORTS AT PARKHURST.    The last Saturday before the summer holidays was invariably a great day  at Parkhurst.  The outdoor exercises of the previous ten months  culminated then in the annual athletic sports, which made a regular  field-day for the whole school.  Boys who had \"people\" living within a  reasonable distance always did their best to get them over for the day;  the doctor--an old athlete himself--generally invited his own party of  friends; and a large number of spectators from Parkhurst village and the  neighbourhood were sure to put in an appearance, and help to give  importance to the occasion.  Athletic sports without spectators (at  least, so we boys thought) would be a tame affair, and we were sure to  get through our day's performances all the better for a large muster of  outsiders on the ground.    The occasion I am about to recall was specially interesting to me, as it  was the first athletic meeting in which I, a small boy just entering my  teens, ever figured.  I was only down to run in one of the races, and  that was the three-legged race; and yet I believe there was not a boy in  the school so excited at the prospect of these sports as I was.  I  thought the time would never come, and was in positive despair when on  the day before it a little white cloud ventured to appear in the blue  sky.  A wet day, so I thought, would have been as great a calamity as  losing the whole circle of my relatives, and almost as bad as having my  favourite dog stolen, or my fishing-rod smashed; and I made a regular  fool of myself in the morning of the eventful day by getting up first at  two a.m., then at three, then at four, and four or five times more, to  take observations out of the window, till at last my bedfellow declared  he would stand it no longer, and that since I was up, I should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#14)"],[1,"into brown; and Mr. Gould has put it with a pink water  plant, which harmonizes with it to the bird's advantage; while the tiny  creature stands on the bent leaf of a reed, and scarcely bends it more!  \"It runs with rapidity over broken reeds, and moves gracefully, raising  and displaying its tail at every step.\" It has so very small a tail to  display, however, that I should hardly think the display was worth  while. \"It is very cunning, and especially noticeable for the subtlety  with which it wearies the dog of the sportsman by executing a thousand  evolutions with surprising celerity; whence comes the trivial name of  'kill-dog' bestowed upon it in some localities. Pursued to extremity,  it casts itself into the water, swims with ease, and dives at the  moment its enemy is about to seize it; or it conceals itself in a tuft  of reeds or a bush, and by this means often escapes with impunity. It  loves to breed among the reeds, and in long and thick grass, frequently  in small companies of its own species, or of the Stellaris. The female  lays her eggs on an inartificially constructed platform of decayed  leaves or stalks of marsh plants, slightly elevated above the water.\"  How elevated, I cannot find proper account,--that is to say, whether it  is hung to the stems of growing reeds, or built on hillocks of soil,  but the bird is always liable to have its nest overflowed by floods.  The full-grown bird is dressed in an exquisite perfection of barred  bodice, spotted chemisette, and waved feathers edged with gray on the  back.    99. The reader will please recollect these three Allegrets as the  second group of the dab- or dabble-chicks; and, while the water-ouzel  is a mountain and torrent bird, these inhabit exclusively flat lands  and calm water, belonging properly to temperate, inclining to warm,  climates, and able to gladden for us--as their name now given  implies--many scenes and places otherwise little enlivened; and to make  the very gnats of them profitable to us, were we wise enough. Dainty  and delightful creatures in all their ways,--voice only dubitable, but  I hope not a shriek or a squeak;--and there seems to be no reason  whatever why half our fen lands should not be turned into beds of white  water lilies and golden ducks, with jetty ducklings, to the great  comfort of English souls.[22]          [22] Compare Bishop Stanley's account of the larger tropical        'Jacana,' p. 311. \"One species is often tamed, and from its being        a resolute enemy to birds of prey, the inhabitants of the        countries where it is found\" (which be they?) \"rear it as a        protector for their fowls, as it not only feeds with them, but        accompanies them into the fields, and brings them back in the        evening!\"      III.    TREPIDA STAGNARUM.    LITTLE GREBE.    100. The two birds--Torrent-ouzel, and Lily-ouzel,--which we have been  just describing, agree, you will observe, in delicate and singular use  of their feet in the water; the torrent-ouzel holding itself  mysteriously at the bottom; and the lily-ouzel, less mysteriously, but  as skillfully, on the top (for I forgot to note, respecting this  raft-walking, that the bird, however light, must be always careful not  to tread on the edges of leaves, but in the middle, or, rather, as  nearly as may be where they are set on the stalk; it would go in at  once if it trod on the edges). But both the birds have the foot which  is really characteristic of land, not water-birds; and especially of  those land species that run well. Of the real action of the toes,  either in running, or hopping, nothing is told us by the  anatomists--(compare lecture on Robin, Sec. 26); but I hope before long to  get at some of the facts respecting the greater flexibility of the  gripping and climbing feet, and elasticity of running ones; and to draw  up something like a properly graduated scale of the length of the toes  in proportion to that of the body.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    And, for one question, relative to this--the balance of a bird  _standing_, not gripping--is to be thought of. Taking a typical profile  of bird-form in its abstract, with beak, belly, and foot, horizontal  (Fig. 12), the security of the standing, (supposing atomic weight equal  through the bird's body, and the _will_, in the ankle, of iron,) is the  same as of an inverted cone, between the dotted lines from the  extremities of the foot to those of the body; and, of course, with a  little grip of the foot or hind claw, the bird can be safe in almost  any position it likes. Nevertheless, when the feet are as small in  proportion as the Torrent-ouzel's, I greatly doubt the possibility of  such a balance as Bewick has given it (Fig. 13 _a_). Gould's of the  black-bodiced Ouzel (Fig. 13 _b_) is, I imagine, right. Bewick was  infallible in plume texture, and expression either of the features of  animals, or of any action that had meaning in it; but he was singularly  careless of indifferent points in geometry or perspective; and even  loses character in his water-birds, by making them always swim on the  top of the water.    [Illustration: FIG. 13_a_.]    101. But, whatever their balance of body, or use of foot, the two birds  just examined are, as I said, essentially connected with the running  land birds, or broadly, the Plovers; and with the Sand-runners, or  (from their cry) Sandpipers, which Mr. Gould evidently associates  mentally with the Plovers, in his description of the plumage of the  Dunlin; while he gives to them in his plates of that bird--the little  Stint, and common Sandpiper--most subtle action with their fine  feet,--thread-fine, almost, in the toes; requiring us, it seems to me,  to consider them as entirely land-birds, however fond of the wave  margins. But the next real water-ouzel we come to, belongs to a group  with feet like little horse-chestnut leaves; each toe having its  separate lobes of web. Why separated, I cannot yet make out, but the  bird swims, or even dives, on occasion, with dexterity and force. These  lobe-footed birds consist first of the Grebes, which are connected with  fresh-water ducks; and, secondly, of the Phalaropes, which are a sort  of sea-gulls. No bird which is not properly web-footed has any business  to think itself either true duck or true gull; but as, both in size and  habit of life, the larger grebes and phalaropes are entirely aquatic  and marine, I shall take out of them into my class of dabchicks, only  those which are literally dabblers in habit, and chickens in size. And  of the Grebes, therefore, only the one commonly known as the Dabchick,  the 'Little Grebe,' 'Colymbus Minutus' (Minute Diver), of Linnaeus. A  summary word or two, first, respecting the Grebe family, will be  useful.    [Illustration: FIG. 13_b_.]    102. Grebe, properly, I suppose, Grebe, from the French, is not in  Johnson, nor do any of my books tell me what it means. I retain it,  however, as being short, not ugly, and well established in two  languages. We may think of it as formed from gre, and meaning 'a nice  bird.' The specialities of the whole class, easily remembered, are,  first, that they have chestnut-leaf feet; secondly, that their legs are  serrated behind with a double row of notches--(why?); thirdly, that  they have no tails; fourthly, that they have, most of them, very fine  and very comic crests, tufts, tippets, and other variously applied  appendages to their heads and chins, so that some are called 'crested,'  some 'eared,' some 'tippeted,' and so on; but the least of them, our  proper Dabchick, displays no absurdity of this sort, and I have the  less scruple in distinguishing it from others. I find, further, in  Stanley's classes, the Grebes placed among the short-winged birds, and  made to include all the divers; but he does not say how short their  wings are; and his grouping them with guillemots and puffins is  entirely absurd, all their ways and looks, and abodes, being those of  ducks. We can say no more of them as a family, accordingly, until we  know what a duck is;--and I go on to the little pet of them, whose ways  are more entirely its own.    103. Strangely, the most interesting fact (if _fact_ it be) that it  builds a floating nest, gains scarcely more than chance notice from its  historians. Here is Mr. Gould's account of it: \"The materials composing  this raft or nest are weeds and aquatic plants carefully heaped  together in a rounded form; it is very large at the base, and is so  constantly added to, that a considerable portion of it becomes  submerged; at the same time it is sufficiently buoyant to admit of its  saucer-like hollow top being always above the surface. In this wet  depression five or six eggs are laid. The bird, always most alert, is  still more so now, and scarcely ever admits of a near examination of  the nest-making, or of a view of the eggs. In favorable situations,  however, and with the aid of a telescope, the process may be watched;  and it is not a little interesting to notice with what remarkable  quickness the dabchick scratches the weeds over her eggs with her feet,  when she perceives herself observed, so as not to lead even to the  suspicion that any were deposited on the ill-shapen floating mass. This  work of an instant displays as much skill in deception as can well be  imagined.\"    104. It is still left to question, first, what is meant by a wet  depression?--does the bird actually sit in the water, and are the eggs  under it? and, if not, how is the water kept out? Secondly, is the  floating nest anchored, and how? Looking to other ornithologists for  solution of these particulars, I find nobody else say anything about a  floating nest at all. Bewick describes it as being of a large size, and  composed of a very great quantity of grass and water plants, at least a  foot in thickness, and so placed in the water that the female hatches  her eggs amidst the continual wet in which they"]]]
