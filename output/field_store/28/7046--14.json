Now, Miss Rider, you're going to be frank with me, aren't you?\"    She looked at him again and smiled sadly.    \"I'm afraid I shan't be any more frank than I have been, Mr. Tarling,\"  she said. \"If you want me to tell you why I assumed the name of  Stevens, or why I ran away from London, I cannot tell you. I had a good  reason----\" she paused, \"and I may yet have a better reason for running  away....\"    She nearly said \"again\" but checked the word.    He laid his hand on hers.    \"When I told you of this murder,\" he said earnestly, \"I knew by your  surprise and agitation that you were innocent. Later the doctor was  able to prove an alibi which cannot be shaken. But, Miss Rider, when  I surprised you, you spoke as though you knew who committed the crime.  You spoke of a man and it is that man's name I want.\"    She shook her head.    \"That I shall never tell you,\" she said simply.    \"But don't you realise that you may be charged with being an accessory  before or after the act?\" he urged. \"Don't you see what it means to you  and to your mother?\"    Her eyes closed at the mention of her mother's name, as though to shut  out the vision of some unpleasant possibility.    \"Don't talk about it, don't talk about it!\" she murmured, \"please, Mr.  Tarling! Do as you wish. Let the police arrest me or try me or hang  me--but do not ask me to say any more, because I will not, I will not!\"    Tarling sank back amongst the cushions, baffled and bewildered, and no  more was said.    Whiteside was waiting for the train, and with him were two men who were  unmistakably branded \"Scotland Yard.\" Tarling drew him aside and  explained the situation in a few words.    \"Under the circumstances,\" he said, \"I shall not execute the warrant.\"    Whiteside agreed.    \"It is quite impossible that she could have committed the murder,\" he  said. \"I suppose the doctor's evidence is unshakable?\"    \"Absolutely,\" said Tarling, \"and it is confirmed by the station master  at Ashford, who has the time of the accident logged in his diary, and  himself assisted to lift the girl from the train.\"    \"Why did she call herself Miss Stevens?\" asked Whiteside. \"And what  induced her to leave London so hurriedly?\"    Tarling gave a despairing gesture.    \"That is one of the things I should like to know,\" he said, \"and the very  matter upon which Miss Rider refuses to enlighten me. I am taking her to  an hotel,\" he went on. \"To-morrow I will bring her down to the Yard. But  I doubt if the Chief can say anything that will induce her to talk.\"    \"Was she surprised when you told her of the murder? Did she mention  anybody's name?\" asked Whiteside.    Tarling hesitated, and then, for one of the few times in his life, he  lied.    \"No,\" he said, \"she was just upset ... she mentioned nobody.\"    He took the girl by taxi to the quiet little hotel he had chosen--a  journey not without its thrills, for the fog was now thick--and saw her  comfortably fixed.    \"I can't be sufficiently grateful to you, Mr. Tarling, for your  kindness,\" she said at parting \"and if I could make your task any  easier ... I would.\"    He saw a spasm of pain pass across her face.    \"I don't understand it yet; it seems like a bad dream,\" she said half to  herself. \"I don't want to understand it somehow ... I want to forget, I  want to forget!\"    \"What do you want to forget?\" asked Tarling.    She shook her head.    \"Don't ask me,\" she said. \"Please, please, don't ask me!\"    He walked down the big stairway, a greatly worried man. He had left the  taxi at the door. To his surprise he found the cab had gone, and turned  to the porter.    \"What happened to my taxi?\" he said. \"I didn't pay him off.\"    \"Your taxi, sir?\" said the head porter. \"I didn't see it go. I'll ask one  of the boys.\"    As assistant porter who had been in the street told a surprising tale. A  gentleman had come up out of the murk, had paid off the taxi, which had  disappeared. The witness to this proceeding had not seen the gentleman's  face. All he knew was that this mysterious benefactor had walked away in  an opposite direction to that in which the cab had gone, and had vanished  into the night.    Tarling frowned.    \"That's curious,\" he said. \"Get me another taxi.\"    \"I'm afraid you'll find that difficult, sir.\" The hotel porter shook his  head. \"You see how the fog is--we always get them thick about here--it's  rather late in the year for fogs...\"    Tarling cut short his lecture on meteorology, buttoned up his coat, and  turned out of the hotel in the direction of the nearest underground  station.    The hotel to which he had taken the girl was situated in a quiet  residential street, and at this hour of the night the street was  deserted, and the fog added something to its normal loneliness.    Tarling was not particularly well acquainted with London, but he had a  rough idea of direction. The fog was thick, but he could see the blurred  nimbus of a street lamp, and was midway between two of these when he  heard a soft step behind him.    It was the faintest shuffle of sound, and he turned quickly.  Instinctively he threw up his hands and stepped aside.    Something whizzed past his head and struck the pavement with a thud.    \"Sandbag,\" he noted mentally, and leapt at his assailant.    As quickly his unknown attacker jumped back. There was a deafening  report. His feet were scorched with burning cordite, and momentarily he  released his grip of his enemy's throat, which he had seized.    He sensed rather than saw the pistol raised again, and made one of those  lightning falls which he had learnt in far-off days from Japanese  instructors of ju-jitsu. Head over heels he went as the pistol exploded  for the second time. It was a clever trick, designed to bring the full  force of his foot against his opponent's knee. But the mysterious  stranger was too quick for him, and when Tailing leapt to his feet he was  alone.    But he had seen the face--big and white and vengeful. It was glimpse and  guess-work, but he was satisfied that he knew his man.    He ran in the direction he thought the would-be assassin must have taken,  but the fog was patchy and he misjudged. He heard the sound of hurrying  footsteps and ran towards them, only to find that it was a policeman  attracted by the sound of shots.    The officer had met nobody.    \"He must have gone the other way,\" said Tarling, and raced off in  pursuit, without, however, coming up with his attacker.    Slowly he retraced his footsteps to where he had left the policeman  searching the pavement for same clue which would identify the assailant  of the night.    The constable was using a small electric lamp which he had taken from his  pocket.    \"Nothing here, sir,\" he said. \"Only this bit of red paper.\"    Tarling took the small square of paper from the man's hand and examined  it under the light of the lamp--a red square on which were written four  words in Chinese: \"He brought this trouble upon himself.\"    It was the same inscription as had been found neatly folded in the  waistcoat pocket of Thornton Lyne that morning he was discovered lying  starkly dead.          CHAPTER XIV    THE SEARCH OF MILBURGH'S COTTAGE      Mr. Milburgh had a little house in one of the industrial streets of  Camden Town. It was a street made up for the most part of blank walls,  pierced at intervals with great gates, through which one could procure at  times a view of gaunt factories and smoky-looking chimney-stacks.    Mr. Milburgh's house was the only residence in the road, if one excepted  the quarters of caretakers and managers, and it was agreed by all who saw  his tiny demesne, that Mr. Milburgh had a good landlord.    The \"house\" was a detached cottage in about half an acre of ground, a  one-storey building, monopolising the space which might have been  occupied by factory extension. Both the factory to the right and the left  had made generous offers to acquire the ground, but Mr. Milburgh's  landlord had been adamant. There were people who suggested that Mr.  Milburgh's landlord was Mr. Milburgh himself. But how could that be? Mr.  Milburgh's salary was something under L400 a year, and the cottage site  was worth at least L4,000.    Canvey Cottage, as it was called, stood back from the road, behind a  lawn, innocent of flowers, and the lawn itself was protected from  intrusion by high iron railings which Mr. Milburgh's landlord had had  erected at considerable cost. To reach the house it was necessary to pass  through an iron gate and traverse a stone-flagged path to the door of the  cottage.    On the night when Tarling of Scotland Yard was the victim of a murderous  assault, Mr. Milburgh unlocked the gate and passed through, locking and  double-locking the gate behind him. He was alone, and, as was his wont,  he was whistling a sad little refrain which had neither beginning nor  end. He walked slowly up the stone pathway, unlocked the door of his  cottage, and stood only a moment on the doorstep to survey the growing  thickness of the night, before he closed and bolted the door and switched  on the electric light.    He was in a tiny hallway, plainly but nicely furnished. The note of  luxury was struck by the Zohn etchings which hung on the wall, and which  Mr. Milburgh stopped to regard approvingly. He hung up his coat and hat,  slipped off the galoshes he was wearing (for it was wet underfoot), and,  passing through a door which opened from the passage, came to his living  room. The same simple note of furniture and decoration was observable  here. The furniture was good, the carpet under his feet thick and  luxurious. He snicked down another switch and an electric radiator glowed  in the fireplace. Then he sat down at the big table, which was the most  conspicuous article of furniture in the room. It was practically covered  with orderly little piles of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#14)"],[1,"as such is generally, or always, a compound colour, or  manufactured with a zinc instead of a lead base. In either case the  preceding remarks are not applicable to the present product, which is  perfectly durable and trustworthy. The new Naples yellow presents an  example of an old objectionable pigment being replaced by a different  and superior preparation. However fugitive certain colours may have  been, the fact of their once having had a place on the palette would  seem to be sufficient recommendation to some. At any rate, they are  still in occasional request, and we cannot but approve the pious fraud  which offers under the same name a good substitute for a bad original.  If an artist must needs demand a worthless pigment, he had better buy a  colour like it that will stand, even if it be not what he asked for.    The tints of Naples yellow are readily and accurately imitated by  admixture of deep cadmium yellow and white.    40. ANTIMONY YELLOW,    As its name denotes, was likewise a preparation of that metal, of a  deeper colour than Naples yellow, but similar in its properties. It was  principally used in enamel and porcelain painting, and differed greatly  in tint. One variety, brighter than the rest, is stated not to have  been affected by foul air, and therefore could not have had a lead  basis.      OCHRES,    Known as _Yellow Ochre_, _Brown Ochre_, _Roman Ochre_, _Transparent Gold  Ochre_, _Oxford Ochre_, _Stone Ochre_, _Di Palito_, &c., are native  earths, consisting chiefly of silica and alumina in combination with  iron, which latter forms the principal colouring matter. They are among  the most ancient of pigments, and their permanency is proved by the  state of the old pictures. In a box of colours found at Pompeii, and  analyzed by Count Chaptal, he discovered yellow ochre purified by  washing, which had preserved its original freshness. They may all be  produced artificially in endless variety as they exist in nature, and  are all converted by burning into reds or reddish-browns. Several ochres  are found in the natural state of so very fine a quality, that they  require no other preparation than that of being washed. Their colours  may be imitated to a certain extent by means of iron alone, uncombined  with silica and alumina; but such ferruginous preparations are not  equally durable, and as their chemical action is stronger, they are more  likely to affect those pigments which are damaged by iron. It often  happens in colours that one component of weak stability, or powerful  for evil, is strengthened and held in check by another; thus in the case  of the ochres, the silica and alumina by keeping a tight hand on the  iron, both ensure its safety, and prevent it injuring others.    41. YELLOW OCHRE,    Called also _Mineral Yellow_, is found in most countries, and abundantly  in our own. It differs much both in constitution and colour, ranging  from a tolerably bright though not vivid yellow to a brown-yellow, and  is generally of a warm cast. Its natural variety is much increased by  artificial dressing and compounding. The best yellow ochres possess no  great force, but as far as they go are valuable pigments, particularly  in fresco and distemper, being neither subject to change by ordinary  light, nor sensibly affected by impure air, or the action of lime. By  time, however, and the direct rays of the sun, they are somewhat  darkened. Like other ochres, they may be safely used in admixture with  pigments which are themselves permanent. With carmine and the cochineal  lakes, or intense blue, the ochres are best not employed.    The impunity with which yellow ochre bears foul gas is one of its many  recommendations. No immediate effect whatever is produced by  sulphuretted hydrogen, and only a slight dirty brown tint is imparted  by its prolonged action. This discolouration a short exposure to air and  light quickly removes. By keeping the ochre sufficiently long in contact  with sulphide of ammonium a jet black is obtainable, but a rub of it in  a moist unwashed state completely regains its yellow hue in a day or so.  Hence, yellow ochre compounded with pigments which suffer from an impure  atmosphere doubtless acts as a preservative agent.    Yellow ochre is usually employed in the distance and middle ground of a  landscape. It possesses a slight degree of turbidness, and is esteemed  for this property, which is considered to give it a retiring quality. By  admixture with Antwerp blue or indigo it affords a fine range of quiet  greens, also a very serviceable yellowish drab with Vandyke brown. The  ochre is valuable in warm skies, the sails of ships and boats, sandstone  rocks and cliffs, buildings, hay, sheep, &c. It does not compound kindly  with any of the cold colours, and should therefore be used as a wash  over others that are dry, when required to qualify their tints.    42. ROMAN OCHRE    Is rather deeper and more powerful than the preceding, as well as more  transparent and cool in tint. In other respects it is similar, and forms  with Antwerp blue and indigo a like excellent range of greens. We may  observe, however, that as indigo is not a permanent pigment, the colours  it yields by admixture cannot be durable as far as the blue is  concerned. Roman ochre and brown madder are admirably adapted for red  sails, and autumnal effects of foliage.    43. BROWN OCHRE,    Likewise known as _Spruce Ochre_ and _Ocre de Rue_, or, more correctly  _Ru_, is a dense, deep-toned brownish yellow, fine in sandy foregrounds.  With Indian yellow it gives a dark autumnal tint of great richness, but  stable only as respects the ochre. When mixed with other colours, it  furnishes a series of rich yet sober tones of extensive use. It covers  well, without being too opaque; and compounded with black and a little  brown-red is good for backgrounds, &c.    44. TRANSPARENT GOLD OCHRE    Resembles in a great degree Roman ochre, but is clearer in its tints,  and more transparent. It is also brighter and much less opaque than  yellow ochre. It approaches somewhat the character of clear bright raw  sienna, though more pure and brilliant, serving for strong  semi-transparent greens and sunny effects.    45. OXFORD OCHRE    Is a native pigment from the neighbourhood of Oxford, semi-opaque, of a  warm yellow colour and soft argillaceous texture, absorbent of water and  oil, in both of which it may be safely employed. It is one of the best  of yellow ochres.    46. STONE OCHRE    Has been confounded with the last variety, to which, as well as to Roman  ochre, it is frequently similar. True stone ochres are found in balls or  globular masses of various sizes in the solid body of stones, lying near  the surface of rocks among the quarries of Gloucestershire and  elsewhere. These balls are smooth and compact, in general free from  grit, and of a powdery fracture. They vary exceedingly in colour, from  yellow to brown, murrey, and gray, but otherwise do not differ from  ordinary ochres.    In enamel they may be used for browns and dull reds.    47. DI PALITO    Is a light yellow ochre, with no special distinguishing quality, except  that its tints are rather purer in colour than most ochres.    48. ORIENT YELLOW    Is an entirely new preparation of absolute permanence, and perfectly  unexceptionable in all respects, both in water and oil. We can give it  no higher praise than by saying it equals aureolin in stability, as well  as in neither injuring, nor being injured by, other colours. Not  possessed of the same amount of transparency, it is distinguished by  greater richness and depth. Of a soft golden hue, lustrous and luminous,  it resembles a brilliant and somewhat opaque Indian yellow. A gorgeous  and durable substitute for that fugitive pigment is produced by  compounding the orient with aureolin, or by using the latter as a glaze.  Being more transparent than cadmiums and less obtrusive, the new yellow  is adapted for mellow sunset and sunrise clouds, or for sunshine on  distant mountains. With French blue it affords a beautiful sea green;  and, mixed with aureolin, gives fine foliage tints. It is also eligible  for draperies and illumination. For enamelling it is inadmissible, the  colour being destroyed by great heat; but in fresco it may safely be  employed.    As in the case of aureolin, we have had a prolonged personal experience  of this new yellow, an experience which justifies us in asserting that  there is none more permanent. In the whole range of artistic colours  there is no pigment less affected by chemical or physical agents. Acid  and ammoniacal fumes, foul gases, and exposure to damp, air, light, or  sunshine, equally fail to injure it. The perfect impunity with which it  bears the action both of sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphide of ammonium  is remarkable. The former gas may be continuously passed into the colour  suspended in water, or a strong solution of the latter sulphide be  poured upon it, and the yellow remains unchanged. Submitted to the  direct rays of the sun during an entire summer, its lightest and  faintest tints have preserved their original hue.    In a preceding chapter we remarked that, provided the colour be stable,  the more colour a pigment possesses the better. The \"latent colour\"  there alluded to, is one of the advantages of orient yellow. The more it  is looked into, the more colour is seen--there is no suspicion of a base  coloured, the pigment is colour itself.    49. ORPIMENT,    Also called _King's Yellow_, _Chinese Yellow_, _Yellow Orpiment_, &c.,  was known in ancient times: the Romans called it _auri pigmentum_ or  gold colour, whence, by corruption, its present name is derived. It is  found in the native state in China and elsewhere, the best quality being  in masses, consisting of plates of a fine golden hue, intermixed with  portions of a vermilion or orange-red colour; the inferior kinds are  yellow or greenish yellow.
