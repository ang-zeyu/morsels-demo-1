At the  same time he would tell them that, if they had a doubt in their  minds, it was their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that  doubt.    The jury consulted together for a minute or two in the jury box,  and then expressed their desire to retire. A buzz of talk arose in  the court, when they had left. Opinion was divided as to what the  verdict would be. When the counsel for the defence sat down, the  general opinion was that the prisoner would be certainly acquitted;  but the speech of the counsel for the prosecution, and the summing  up of the judge, had caused a reaction, and few doubted now that  the verdict would be guilty.    So Reuben himself thought. It was he felt hard that, standing there  to be tried for burglary, the decision should, in fact, depend upon  that unjust charge which had, four years ago, been brought against  him. Reuben was in the habit of what he called arguing things out  by himself; and as he stood there, waiting for the verdict, he  tried to put himself in the position of the jury; and he felt that,  in that case, he should have difficulty in coming to a decision.    It was not until after the lamps had been lighted that the jury  returned into the box. The crier shouted for order, and there was  not a sound heard, as the foreman told the judge that they were not  agreed upon their verdict.    \"Then you must go back, gentlemen, until you are,\" the judge said.    \"We are eleven one way, and one the other. Won't that do, my lord?\"    \"No, sir,\" the judge replied. \"You must be unanimous.\"    The jury again retired, the judge and counsel went off to dine at  the hotel, and almost all the public trooped out. Two hours later,  as the jury did not return, Reuben Whitney was taken back to the  jail, and the court closed. At nine o'clock in the morning, a  warder entered.    \"The jury have come back into the court,\" he said. \"They are going  to return a verdict.\"    Reuben was again placed in the dock. The seats open to the public  quickly filled, as the news spread through the town. Several of the  members of the bar dropped in, and then the judge came in and took  his seat.    Reuben had occupied the time in trying to judge, from the faces of  the jury, what their verdict was going to be. They looked sulky and  tired. But as Reuben's eye rested on Jacob Priestley, whom he had  at once recognized among the jury, the smith gave him an  encouraging wink. At least, so Reuben thought; but as the next  moment he was looking as surly as the rest, he thought that he must  have been mistaken.    \"Are you agreed, gentlemen, as to the verdict you find in this  case?\" the judge asked.    \"We are, my lord,\" the foreman replied.    \"Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?\"    \"Not guilty, my lord.\"    \"Very well, gentlemen,\" the judge said tartly. \"It is your verdict,  not mine.\"    At the foreman's word a thrill had run through the court; for when  it was known, the evening before, that eleven were one way and one  the other, the belief had been general that the majority were for a  conviction. Reuben himself had so understood it, and the verdict  was a complete surprise to him.    [Illustration: Reuben Whitney Acquitted of the Charge of Burglary]    The constable raised the bar for him to leave the dock, and as he  moved out his friend the schoolmaster pushed forward, and shook him  warmly by the hand.    \"Thank God for that verdict, Reuben. I am indeed rejoiced, and I  own I hardly expected it.\"    \"I didn't expect it at all,\" Reuben said in a choked voice, for his  sudden liberation had shaken him, more than his arrest or any of  the subsequent proceedings had done.    \"I congratulate you heartily, Reuben,\" Mr. Ellison said, putting  his hand on his shoulder.    The squire had waited at Lewes until ten o'clock on the previous  evening, and had driven over again the first thing in the morning,  so anxious was he about the verdict.    \"I didn't believe you guilty this time, my boy, from the first. I  was glad indeed to hear the verdict; for after the judge's summing  up, I was sorely uneasy.    \"And now, Reuben, I hope,\" he said, as they entered the street,  \"that you have quite forgiven me for that old business. It has been  the unfortunate cause of getting you into this affair. Had it not  been for that no one would ever, for a moment, have doubted the  truth of your story.\"    \"There is nothing to forgive, squire,\" Reuben said. \"I never blamed  you for it, from the first; and even had I done so, your goodness,  of which I only heard yesterday, would have made up, many times,  for any mistake you may have made then.\"    \"That is right, my lad,\" the squire said. \"I am glad that matter is  made up. And now I will not keep you, for I know you will want to  be off home to your mother.\"    Reuben walked quietly home, so as to give the schoolmaster, who had  hurried on ahead, time to break the news of his acquittal to his  mother. Mrs. Whitney had remained in court during the trial, but  had retired when the jury left to consider their verdict, being  completely overcome with agitation and excitement. The schoolmaster  had slept in the house, and had persuaded her not to go to the  court in the morning; fearing as he did that the verdict would be a  hostile one. She completely broke down when she was told the news,  and was still sobbing when Reuben arrived.    The schoolmaster at once took his leave, leaving mother and son  together; and promised them to return in a day or two. When he  again came over, he saw at once that Mrs. Whitney was looking  depressed and unhappy.    \"What do you think, Mr. Shrewsbury? Reuben says that he shall go  abroad, out to Australia. I have talked against it till I am  hoarse, but it's no good. I hope you will persuade him to give up  such a mad idea.\"    \"I will hear what he has to say first, Mrs. Whitney. Reuben has  generally a good deal to say for his side of a question, and I must  hear his reasons before I can argue against them.    \"Now, Reuben, what have you to say for yourself?\"    \"I made up my mind while I was in jail,\" Reuben replied, \"that if I  was acquitted, I would go right away. These things stick to a man  all through his life. That first affair, four years ago, nearly got  me transported now; and if a small matter like that did me such  harm, what will this do? If I had been proved to be innocent, it  would have been different; but as it is, I believe nine people out  of ten in court thought I was guilty; and I am convinced that the  jury were eleven to one against me, only the twelfth was more  obstinate than they were, and so they gave in. I believe it was  Jacob Priestley the blacksmith who held out, for the sake of old  times.    \"At any rate, a great many people will think me guilty, all their  lives, unless something turns up to prove my innocence. Mother says  we might settle somewhere else, where we ain't known; but I should  never feel safe. Years on, someone from Lewes might see me and tell  the story; or Tom Thorne might keep on my track. I won't risk it.    \"I have been to Mr. Penfold, and he says if I am determined to go,  he will cancel my indenture for me. I have no doubt I shall find  work of some sort, out there. I am a pretty good workman now at my  own craft and, if I can't get work at that, I can turn my hand to  something else.    \"My only trouble is about mother. I want her to go with me. I could  make a living for her out there, but she won't have it. She says  six months at sea will kill her, and then she has all sorts of  ideas in her head about the natives. However I hope that, in two or  three years' time, I shall be able to write and tell her that I  have comfortably settled, and have a good home ready for her to  come to; and that then she will join me.\"    \"Never,\" Mrs. Whitney said, excitedly. \"I was born at Lewes, and I  have lived near it all my days, and I will die here. I am not going  to tramp all over the world, and settle down among black people, in  outlandish parts. I could not do it, Mr. Shrewsbury. It's cruel of  him to ask me.\"    The schoolmaster was silent for a minute. He saw that Reuben's mind  was firmly made up, and he could not deny the force of his  reasoning. It was true that many people still considered him  guilty. It was true that this story might crop up again, years on,  and ruin his life. It did seem that the best thing he could do was  to leave the country.    \"Australia is not so bad a place as you fancy, Mrs. Whitney,\" he  said at last. \"They do have troubles with the natives, certainly,  in the outlying settlements; but in the towns you have no more  trouble than you have here. Besides, every year the white  population is increasing, and the black diminishing. Six months'  voyage is not so dreadful as it seems. And though I do think that,  if Reuben goes out, it will be better for you to remain quietly  here till he has a home prepared for you, I think that, when the  time comes, you will change your mind about it.    \"As to Reuben himself, I must own there's a good deal of force in  what he says; and that until those Thornes have been sent out of  the country, his story might follow him. And I have no doubt he  would do well out there. He is a good workman for his age and, as  he says, can turn his hand to almost anything. Labour is scarce out  there and, as he has got his head screwed on the right way, I have  no doubt that he will fall on his feet.\"    \"I didn't expect this of you, Mr. Shrewsbury,\" Mrs. Whitney said,  beginning to cry. \"I thought you would have taken my part, and now  you are going right against me.\"    \"Not against you, Mrs. Whitney, for I think that Reuben's plan is  best for you both. He cannot but suffer, if he remains here; and  you will be unhappy in seeing him suffer."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#14)"],[1,"rose a broad oak staircase.  The rooms, with one or two exceptions, opened into one another, and  were large, and low and long in shape; the walls and floors were of  oak and the ceilings were crossed by ponderous oak beams.    The fireplaces, too, were of the oldest fashion; and in their  comfortable ingle-nook my aunts--in the winter--loved to read or knit.    When the warm weather came, they made similar use of the deep-set  window-sills, over which they indulgently permitted me to scramble on  to the lawn.    The sunlight was a special feature of Hennersley. Forcing its way  through the trellised panes, it illuminated the house with a radiancy,  a soft golden radiancy I have never seen elsewhere.    My relatives seemed to possess some phenomenal attraction for the  sunlight, for, no matter where they sat, a beam brighter than the rest  always shone on them; and, when they got up, I noticed that it always  followed them, accompanying them from room to room and along the  corridors.    But this was only one of the many pleasant mysteries that added to the  joy of my visits to Hennersley. I felt sure that the house was  enchanted--that it was under the control of some benevolent being who  took a kindly interest in the welfare of my relatives.    I remember once, on the occasion of my customary good-morning to Miss  Amelia, who invariably breakfasted in bed, I inhaled the most  delicious odour of heliotrope. It was wafted towards me, in a cool  current of air, as I approached her bed, and seemed, to my childish  fancy, to be the friendly greeting of a sparkling sunbeam that rested  on Miss Amelia's pillow.    I was so charmed with the scent, that, alas! forgetful of my manners,  I gave a loud sniff, and with a rapturous smile ejaculated, \"Oh!  Auntie! Cherry pie!\"    Miss Amelia started. \"Dear me, child!\" she exclaimed, \"how quietly you  entered. I had no idea you were in the room. Heliotrope is the name of  the scent, my dear, but please do not allude to it again. Your Aunt  Deborah and I are very fond of it\"--here she sighed--\"but for certain  reasons--reasons you would not understand--we do not like to hear the  word heliotrope mentioned. Kiss me, dear, and run away to your  breakfast.\"    For the first time in my life, perhaps, I was greatly puzzled. I could  not see why I should be forbidden to refer to such a pleasant and  harmless subject--a subject that, looked at from no matter what point  of view, did not appear to me to be in the slightest degree  indelicate. The more I thought over it, the more convinced I became  that there was some association between the scent and the sunbeam,  and in that association I felt sure much of the mystery lay.    The house was haunted--agreeably, delightfully haunted by a golden  light, a perfumed radiant light that could only have in my mind one  origin, one creator--Titania--Titania, queen of the fairies, the  guardian angel of my aged, my extremely aged relatives.    \"Aunt Deborah,\" I said one morning, as I found her seated in the  embrasure of the breakfast room window crocheting, \"Aunt Deborah! You  love the sunlight, do you not?\"    She turned on me a startled face. \"What makes you ask such strange  questions, child?\" she said. \"Of course I like the--sun. Most people  do. It is no uncommon thing, especially at my age.\"    \"But the sunbeams do not follow every one, auntie, do they?\" I  persisted.    Miss Deborah's crochet fell into her lap.    \"How queerly you talk,\" she said, with a curious trembling of her  lips. \"How can the sunbeams follow one?\"    \"But they do, auntie, they do indeed!\" I cried. \"I have often watched  a bright beam of golden light follow Aunt Amelia and you, in  different parts of the room. And it has settled on your lace collar  now.\"    Miss Deborah looked at me very seriously; but the moistening of her  eyes I attributed to the strong light. \"Esther,\" she said, laying one  of her soft hands on my forehead, \"there are things God does not want  little girls to understand--question me no more.\"    I obeyed, but henceforth I felt more than ever assured that my aunts,  consciously or unconsciously, shared their charming abode with some  capricious genii, of whose presence in their midst I had become  accidentally aware; and to find out the enchanted neighbourhood of its  mysterious retreat was to me now a matter of all-absorbing importance.  I spent hour after hour roaming through the corridors, the copses, and  my beloved flower gardens, in eager search of some spot I could  unhesitatingly affirm was the home of the genii. Most ardently I then  hoped that the sunbeams would follow me, and that the breeze charged  with cool heliotrope would greet me as it did Aunt Deborah.    In the daytime, all Hennersley was sunshine and flowers, and, stray  where I would, I never felt lonely or afraid; but as the light waned I  saw and felt a subtle change creep over everything. The long aisles of  trees that in the morning only struck me as enchantingly peaceful and  shady, gradually filled with strangely terrifying shadows; the hue of  the broad swards deepened into a darkness I did not dare interpret,  whilst in the house, in its every passage, nook, and corner, a gloom  arose that, seeming to come from the very bowels of the earth, brought  with it every possible suggestion of bogey.    I never spoke of these things to my relatives, partly because I was  ashamed of my cowardice, and partly because I dreaded a fresh rebuke.  How I suffered! and how I ridiculed my sufferings in the mornings,  when every trace of darkness was obliterated, and amid the radiant  bloom of the trees I thought only of heliotrope and sunbeams.    One afternoon my search for the abode of the genii led me to the  wingless side of the house, a side I rarely visited. At the foot of  the ivy-covered walls and straight in their centre was laid a wide  bed of flowers, every one of which was white. But why white? Again  and again I asked myself this question, but I dared not broach it to  my relatives. A garden all white was assuredly an enigma--and to every  enigma there is undoubtedly a key. Was this garden, which was all  white, in any way connected with the sunbeams and heliotrope? Was it  another of the mysteries God concealed from little girls? Could this  be the home of the genii? This latter idea had no sooner entered my  head than it became a conviction. Of course! There was no doubt  whatever--it was the home of the genii.    The white petals were now a source of peculiar interest to me. I was  fascinated: the minutes sped by and still I was there. It was not  until the sun had disappeared in the far-distant horizon, and the grim  shadows of twilight were creeping out upon me from the neighbouring  trees and bushes, that I awoke from my reverie--and fled!    That night--unable to sleep through the excitement caused by my  discovery of the home of the genii--I lay awake, my whole thoughts  concentrated in one soul-absorbing desire, the passionate desire to  see the fairy of Hennersley--I had never heard of ghosts--and hear its  story. My bedroom was half-way down the corridor leading from the head  of the main staircase to the extremity of the wing.    After I said good-night I did not see my aunts again till the  morning--they never by any chance visited me after I was in bed. Hence  I knew, when I had retired for the night, I should not see a human  face nor hear a human voice for nearly twelve hours. This--when I  thought of the genii with its golden beams of light and scent of  heliotrope--did not trouble me; it was only when my thoughts would not  run in this channel that I felt any fear, and that fear was not of the  darkness itself, but of what the darkness suggested.    On this particular night, for the first few hours, I was sublimely  happy, and then a strange restlessness seized me. I was obsessed with  a wish to see the flower-garden. For some minutes, stimulated by a  dread of what my aunts would think of such a violation of  conventionality on the part of a child, I combated furiously with the  desire; but at length the longing was so great, so utterly and wholly  irresistible, that I succumbed, and, getting quietly out of bed, made  my way noiselessly into the corridor.    All was dark and still--stiller than I had ever known it before.  Without any hesitation I plunged forward, in the direction of the  wingless side of the house, where there was a long, narrow, stained  window that commanded an immediate prospect of the white garden.    I had seldom looked out of it, as up to the present this side of the  house had little attraction for me; but all was changed now; and, as I  felt my way cautiously along the corridor, a thousand and one fanciful  notions of what I might see surged through my brain.    I came to the end of the corridor, I descended half a dozen stairs, I  got to the middle of the gallery overlooking the large entrance  hall--below me, above me, on all sides of me, was Stygian darkness. I  stopped, and there suddenly rang out, apparently from close at hand, a  loud, clear, most appallingly clear, blood-curdling cry, which,  beginning in a low key, ended in a shriek so horrid, harsh, and  piercing, that I felt my heart shrivel up within me, and in sheer  desperation I buried my fingers in my ears to deaden the sound.    I was now too frightened to move one way or the other. All the  strength departed from my limbs, and when I endeavoured to move my  feet, I could not--they appeared to be fastened to the ground with  lead weights.    I felt, I intuitively felt that the author of the disturbance was  regarding my terror with grim satisfaction, and that it was merely  postponing further action in order to enjoy my suspense. To block out  the sight of this dreadful creature, I clenched my eyelids tightly  together, at the same time earnestly imploring God to help me.    Suddenly I heard the low wail begin again, and then the echo of a  far-off"]]]
