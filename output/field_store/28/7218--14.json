He debated moving into  the range of those windows to investigate the far side of the towers for  doorways. The mist and the message from Nalik'ideyu nourished his  suspicions. Out in the open he would be too good a target for whatever  or whoever might be standing within the deep-welled frames.    The silence was shattered by a boom. Travis jumped, slewed half around,  knife in hand.    Boom-boom ... a second heavy beat-beat ... then a clangor with a  swelling echo.    Kaydessa flung back her head and called, her voice rising up as if  tunneled by the valley walls. She then whistled as she had done when  they fronted the ape-thing and ran on to catch at Travis' sleeve, her  face eager.    \"My people! Come--it is my people!\"    She tugged him on before breaking into a run, weaving fearlessly around  the base of one of the towers. Travis ran after her, afraid he might  lose her in the mist.    Three towers, another stretch of open pavement, and then the mist lifted  to show them a second carved doorway not two hundred yards ahead. The  boom-boom seemed to pull Kaydessa, and Travis could do nothing but trail  her, the coyotes now trotting beside him.          8      They burst through a last wide band of mist into a wilderness of tall  grass and shrubs. Travis heard the coyotes give tongue, but it was too  late. Out of nowhere whirled a leather loop, settling about his chest,  snapping his arms tight to his body, taking him off his feet with a jerk  to be dragged helplessly along the ground behind a galloping horse.    A tawny fury sprang in the air to snap at the horse's head. Travis  kicked fruitlessly, trying to regain his feet as the horse reared, and  fought against the control of his shouting rider. All through the melee  the Apache heard Kaydessa shrilly screaming words he did not understand.    Travis was on his knees, coughing in the dust, exerting the muscles in  his chest and shoulders to loosen the lariat. On either side of him the  coyotes wove a snarling pattern of defiance, dashing back and forth to  present no target for the enemy, yet keeping the excited horses so  stirred up that their riders could use neither ropes nor blades.    Then Kaydessa ran between two of the ringing horses to Travis and jerked  at the loop about him. The tough, braided leather eased its hold, and he  was able to gasp in full lungfuls of air. She was still shouting, but  the tone had changed from one of recognition to a definite scolding.    Travis won to his feet just as the rider who had lassoed him finally got  his horse under rein and dismounted. Holding the rope, the man walked  hand over hand toward them, as Travis back on the Arizona range would  have approached a nervous, unschooled pony.    The Mongol was an inch or so shorter than the Apache, and his face was  young, though he had a drooping mustache bracketing his mouth with  slender spear points of black hair. His breeches were tucked into high  red boots, and he wore a loose felt jacket patterned with the same  elaborate embroidery Travis had seen on Kaydessa's. On his head was a  hat with a wide fur border--in spite of the heat--and that too bore  touches of scarlet and gold design.    Still holding his lariat, the Mongol reached Kaydessa and stood for a  moment, eying her up and down before he asked a question. She gave an  impatient twitch to the rope. The coyotes snarled, but the Apache  thought the animals no longer considered the danger immediate.    \"This is my brother Hulagur.\" Kaydessa made the introduction over her  shoulder. \"He does not have your speech.\"    Hulagur not only did not understand, he was also impatient. He jerked at  the rope with such sudden force that Travis was almost thrown. Then  Kaydessa dragged as fiercely on the lariat in the other direction and  burst into a soaring harangue which drew the rest of the men closer.    Travis flexed his upper arms, and the slack gained by Kaydessa's action  made the lariat give again. He studied the Tatar outlaws. There were  five of them beside Hulagur, lean men, hard-faced, narrow-eyed, the  ragged clothing of three pieced out with scraps of hide. Besides the  swords with the curved blades, they were armed with bows, two to each  man, one long, one shorter. One of the riders carried a lance, long  tassels of woolly hair streaming from below its head. Travis saw in them  a formidable array of barbaric fighting men, but he thought that man for  man the Apaches could not only take on the Mongols with confidence, but  might well defeat them.    The Apache had never been a hot-headed, ride-for-glory fighter like the  Cheyenne, the Sioux, and the Comanche of the open plains. He estimated  the odds against him, used ambush, trick, and every feature of the  countryside as weapon and defense. Fifteen Apache fighting men under  Chief Geronimo had kept five thousand American and Mexican troops in the  field for a year and had come off victorious for the moment.    Travis knew the tales of Genghis Khan and his formidable generals who  swept over Asia into Europe, unbeaten and seemingly undefeatable. But  they had been a wild wave, fed by a reservoir of manpower from the  steppes of their homeland, utilizing driven walls of captives to protect  their own men in city assaults and attacks. He doubted if even that  endless sea of men could have won the Arizona desert defended by Apaches  under Cochise, Victorio, or Magnus Colorado. The white man had done  it--by superior arms and attrition; but bow against bow, knife against  sword, craft and cunning against craft and cunning--he did not think  so....    Hulagur dropped the end of the lariat, and Kaydessa swung around,  loosening the loop so that the rope fell to Travis' feet. The Apache  stepped free of it, turned and passed between two of the horsemen to  gather up the bow he had dropped. The coyotes had gone with him and when  he turned again to face the company of Tatars, both animals crowded past  him to the entrance of the valley, plainly urging him to retire there.    The horsemen had faced about also, and the warrior with the lance  balanced the shaft of the weapon in his hand as if considering the  possibility of trying to spear Travis. But just then Kaydessa came up,  towing Hulagur by a firm hold on his sash-belt.    \"I have told this one,\" she reported to Travis, \"how it is between us  and that you also are enemy to those who hunt us. It is well that you  sit together beside a fire and talk of these things.\"    Again that boom-boom broke her speech, coming from farther out in the  open land.    \"You will do this?\" She made of it a half question, half statement.    Travis glanced about him. He could dodge back into the misty valley of  the towers before the Tatars could ride him down. However, if he could  patch up some kind of truce between his people and the outlaws, the  Apaches would have only the Reds from the settlement to watch. Too many  times in Terran past had war on two fronts been disastrous.    \"I come--carrying this--and not pulled by your ropes.\" He held up his  bow in an exaggerated gesture so that Hulagur could understand.    Coiling the lariat, the Mongol looked from the Apache bow to Travis.  Slowly, and with obvious reluctance, he nodded agreement.    At Hulagur's call the lancer rode up to the waiting Apache, stretched  out a booted foot in the heavy stirrup, and held down a hand to bring  Travis up behind him riding double. Kaydessa mounted in the same fashion  behind her brother.    Travis looked at the coyotes. Together the animals stood in the door to  the tower valley, and neither made any move to follow as the horses  trotted off. He beckoned with his hand and called to them.    Heads up, they continued to watch him go in company with the Mongols.  Then without any reply to his coaxing, they melted back into the mists.  For a moment Travis was tempted to slide down and run the risk of taking  a lance point between the shoulders as he followed Naginlta and  Nalik'ideyu into retreat. He was startled, jarred by the new awareness  of how much he had come to depend on the animals. Ordinarily, Travis Fox  was not one to be governed by the wishes of a _mba'a_, intelligent and  un-animallike as it might be. This was an affair of men, and coyotes had  no part in it!    Half an hour later Travis sat in the outlaw camp. There were fifteen  Mongols in sight, a half dozen women and two children adding to the  count. On a hillock near their yurts, the round brush-and-hide  shelters--not too different from the wickiups of Travis' own people--was  a crude drum, a hide stretched taut over a hollowed section of log. And  next to that stood a man wearing a tall pointed cap, a red robe, and a  girdle from which swung a fringe of small bones, tiny animal skulls, and  polished bits of stone and carved wood.    It was this man's efforts which sent the boom-boom sounding at intervals  over the landscape. Was this a signal--part of a ritual? Travis was not  certain, though he guessed that the drummer was either medicine man or  shaman, and so of some power in this company. Such men were credited  with the ability to prophesy and also endowed with mediumship between  man and spirit in the old days of the great Hordes.    The Apache evaluated the rest of the company. As was true of his own  party, these men were much the same age--young and vigorous. And it was  also apparent that Hulagur held a position of some importance among  them--if he were not their chief.    After a last resounding roll on the drum, the shaman thrust the sticks  into his girdle and came down to the fire at the center of the camp. He  was taller than his fellows, pole thin under his robes, his face narrow,  clean-shaven, with brows arched by nature to give him an unchanging  expression of scepticism.

It was in vain that  the brave commander shouted to his soldiers not to run away, for when  he himself received three blows from the club he was obliged to make  off as fast as possible.    [Illustration]    When the club had destroyed or driven away into the desert all the  troops it came back to its master; he, still wearing the magic cap,  and with his carpet folded up under his arm and his club in his hand,  made his way to the king's apartment.    In the palace shouts of joy had succeeded the cries of fear which had  been heard but a short while ago. Every one was happy, and every one  congratulated the king upon his victory, as sudden and complete as it  was unexpected. But the monarch, turning to his warriors, addressed  them thus: \"Victory! Let us rather return thanks to God. He who has  won for us the victory has but to present himself and receive the  reward he so richly deserves, that is, my beautiful daughter in  marriage, the half of my kingdom, and the right of succession to my  throne. These are the gifts that await this victorious hero. Where is  he?\"    They all stood silent and looked from one to the other. Then the  fisherman, who had taken off his cap, appeared before the assembly and  said, \"Behold, it was I who destroyed your enemies, O king. This is  the second time that I have been promised the hand of the princess in  marriage, the half of the kingdom, and the right of succession to the  throne.\"    The king, struck dumb with amazement, looked inquiringly at his  chamberlain, then recovering his presence of mind he shook hands with  the fisherman.    \"Your good health, my friend. By what happy fortune do you return safe  and sound to my court? The chamberlain told me that through your own  carelessness you had fallen out of the tower window; in truth, we  mourned you as dead.\"    \"I should not have fallen out of the window if I had not been thrown  down by your chamberlain; there is the traitor. I only escaped death  through God's help, and I have just come to the palace in my air-car.\"    The king made a pretence of being angry with the guilty chamberlain,  and ordered his guards to take him away to the donjon cell; then, with  pretended friendship, he embraced the fisherman and led him to his own  apartments. All the while he was thinking and thinking what he could  do to get rid of him. The idea of having him, a mere peasant and one  of his own subjects, for a son-in-law was most repugnant to him, and  hurt his kingly pride. At last he said, \"The chamberlain will most  certainly be punished for his crime. As for you, who have twice been  my saviour, you shall be my son-in-law. Now the customs observed at  court demand that you should send your bride a wedding gift, a jewel,  or some other trifle of value. When this has been observed I promise  to give my blessing on the marriage, and may you both be happy and  live long.\"    \"I have no jewel worthy of the princess's acceptance. I might have  given her as much gold as she wished, but your chamberlain took my  magic golden ring from me.\"    \"Before insisting upon its return something else might be done. I  thoroughly appreciate the value of your marvellous flying carpet--why  should not we both sit on it and make an excursion to the Valley of  Diamonds? There we can obtain stones of the finest water, such as no  one in the world has ever possessed. Afterwards we will return here  with your wedding present for my daughter.\"    The king then opened the window, and the fisherman, spreading out his  carpet, repeated the magic words.    Thus they took flight into the air, and after travelling one or two  hours began to descend at their destination. It was a valley  surrounded on all sides by rocks so steep and so difficult of access,  that, except by God's special grace, no mortal man imprisoned there  could possibly escape. The ground was strewn with diamonds of the  finest quality. The king and fisherman found it easy to make a large  collection, picking and choosing, gathering and arranging them upon  the carpet. When they had put together all there was room for, the  king sat down, and pointing to a large diamond shining at a little  distance, said to the fisherman, \"There is yet a more splendid one by  the stream yonder; run, my son-in-law, and bring it here, it would be  a pity to leave it.\"    The man went for it, while the king, taking advantage of his absence  to pronounce the magic words, seated himself on the carpet, which  lifted itself up, and floating like an air-car above the forest and  under the clouds, descended by one of the palace windows.    His joy knew no bounds, for he now found himself not only free from  his enemies and rid of the embarrassing presence of the fisherman, but  also the possessor of the richest and most beautiful collection of  diamonds in the world;--by his orders they were put away in the caves  of the royal treasure-house, and with them the magic ring and the  flying carpet.    Meantime the fisherman had returned with the diamond, and had stood  aghast to see the carpet vanishing away in the distance.    Wounded at the ingratitude and indignant at the perversity of a prince  for whom he had done so much, he burst into tears.    And, indeed, he had good reason to weep. For he had but to look at the  enormous height of the polished rocks to be convinced of the  impossibility of climbing them. The vegetation, too, was so scanty  that it could only provide him with food for a very short time. He saw  but two courses open to him: either to die from starvation, or to be  devoured by the monstrous serpents that crawled about in great  numbers. Night was now coming on, and the poor fellow was obliged to  plan some way of escaping the frightful reptiles which were leaving  their hiding-places. At last he climbed up a tree, the highest he  could find, and there, with his magic cap on and his club in his hand,  passed the night without even closing his eyes.    Next morning when the sun rose the serpents went back to their holes,  and the fisherman got down from his tree feeling stiff with cold and  very hungry. For some time he walked about the valley in search of  food, turning over the diamonds now so useless to him. There he found  a few worthless mushrooms, and with such poor food as berries and  sorrel leaves, and the water of the valley stream for drink, he lived  for some days.    One night when he went to sleep it happened that his cap came off and  fell to the ground, whereupon all the reptiles of the place  immediately gathered round him. Aroused by their hisses, he awoke to  find himself surrounded on all sides and almost in reach of their  stings. He immediately seized his club, and had scarcely begun to  repeat the magic formula before the weapon set to work to destroy the  snakes, while the rocks resounded right and left with the blows. It  was as if the monsters were being covered with boiling water, and the  noise they made was like that produced by a flock of birds overtaken  by a storm. They roared and hissed and twisted themselves into a  thousand knots, gradually disappearing one by one. Then the club  returned of its own accord to the fisherman's hands, while he returned  thanks to God for having delivered him from such a horrible death. At  that moment there appeared upon the top of a steep rock his friend,  the old man. Overcome with joy at the sight of him, the fisherman  called out, \"Save me! come to me, my divine protector.\"    The old man spread out his arms towards him, and having blessed him  drew him up, saying, \"Now you are free again, hasten to save your  king, his daughter your bride, and their kingdom. After he had left  you in the valley as food for serpents he was punished for his great  crimes by the return of the enemy, who again laid siege to the  capital. This happened at the very moment when he was surrounded by  his guests, and was boasting of his possession of the air-car, the  magic golden ring, and the rest of his evilly acquired riches.    \"His foes had consulted Yaga, a wicked sorceress; she advised them to  obtain the help of Kostey the magician, who promised his aid in  carrying off the princess. When he came he fell in love with the  beautiful maiden at first sight, and determined to marry her himself.  In order to bring this about he threw the king, the courtiers, and all  the inhabitants of the land into a heavy sleep. Then he bore off the  princess to his own palace, where she has been shut up and ill-treated  because she refuses to have anything to do with him. His castle is  situated at the very end of the world, to the west. There is nothing  to hinder you from taking possession of your carpet and ring, they are  hidden in the king's treasure-house. Then go with your cap and club  and conquer Kostey, rescue the princess, and deliver the king and his  subjects.\"    The fisherman would have thrown himself at the old man's feet to pour  out his gratitude, but he suddenly vanished. So he thanked God for all  His mercies, put on his invisible cap, and taking his club, made his  way towards the capital.    At the end of three days he entered the royal city. All the  inhabitants were sleeping the enchanted sleep, from which they were  powerless to rouse themselves. The fisherman went straight to the  royal treasure-house, took the magic ring and carpet, then seating  himself upon the latter and repeating the magic words, away he went  like a bird, over rustling forests and under clouds, floating across  the blue sky.    After some days of travel he alighted in Kostey's courtyard. Without a  moment's delay he folded up his carpet, put the magic cap on his head,  and with club in hand entered Kostey's room. There, to his  astonishment, stood the magician himself, admiring the"]]]
