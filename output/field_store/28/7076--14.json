The  effect was exactly a representation of an ancient Etruscan vase, with  terra cotta figures on a black background, and when at the end they  stood posed as in a tableau, the likeness was complete. Though scarcely  so pretty as the garland dance, it was considered very clever, and met  with much applause.    For the Idyll XV of Theocritus, Miss Adams had followed Greek tradition,  and had used only the scantiest and simplest of scenery. A few screens  and stools did service for a house, a tiger-skin rug was flung on the  grass, and a brass waterpot, brought by Miss Walters from Cairo,  completed the idea of a classic establishment. It was better to have few  accessories than to present anachronisms, and place modern articles in  an Alexandrian home of the third century B. C.    Dulcie and Carmel, as Gorgo and Praxinoe, made an excellent contrast,  the one carrying out the fair Greek type and the other the dark. They  played their parts admirably, rendering the dialogue with much spirit  and brightness, and with appropriate action. Praxinoe, the fashionable  belle of the third century B. C., donned her garments for the festival  with a mixture of coquetry and Greek dignity that delighted the  audience; Gorgo's passage of arms with the Stranger of Alexandria, was  smart and racy, while Edith, as the affected \"man-about-town\" of the  period was considered a huge success. As nobody in the school was young  enough to take Zopyrion, they had borrowed the gardener's  three-year-old baby, and had trained him to walk on, holding the hand of  Eunoe. He was a pretty child, and dressed in a little white chiton, with  bare legs and feet, he looked very charming, and quite completed the  scene. His round wondering eyes and evident astonishment were indeed  exactly what was required from him to sustain the part.    The wood nymphs, with some slight additions of costume, acted the crowd  through which Gorgo and Praxinoe had to push their way and pilot their  slaves. They pushed and hustled with such vigor as amply to justify the  episode where Praxinoe's muslin veil was torn in two, and the whole  party would have been separated, and Eunoe altogether lost, but for the  help of an Alexandrian gentleman.    Carmel brought out her speech of thanks with much unction.        \"_Praxinoe._ Both this year and for ever may all be well with you, my       dear sir, for your care of us. A good kind man! We're letting Eunoe       get squeezed--come, wretched girl, push your way through.\"    And Nesta, as the courteous stranger, responded with a bow which, if not  absolutely historically correct for the period, was certainly a  combination of the good manners of all the ages.    As it was difficult to find enough items for an entirely classical  program, the second half of the entertainment was to be miscellaneous,  and during the short interval a delegate from the \"Waifs and Strays  Society\" was to give a short address explaining the work of the Homes.    Now Carmel was down in Part II to dance the Pastorale, and she ran into  the house to change her Greek chiton for the dress of a Sicilian  peasant. She went through the veranda and the open French window, and  straight upstairs to her bedroom. She had brought nobody with her,  because, for one thing, she needed no help, and for another she was hot  and excited, and felt that she would like a few minutes' rest quite to  herself. There was no great hurry, so she leisurely put on the pretty  scarlet and white-striped skirt, the velvet apron, the white bodice and  laced corsage, clasped the necklace round her throat, and twisted the  gay silk handkerchief as a head-dress on her dark hair. It was a  prettier and more effective costume even than the Greek one. There was  an Eastern variety of color in it that suited her better than the  simplicity of the chiton. She had completed it, from the gold bangles on  her wrists to the scarlet stockings and neat shoes, and was just turning  to run downstairs again, when she suddenly stopped and listened.    Carmel's little bedroom was really a dressing-room, and possessed two  doors. One led into the passage, and the other communicated with the  Blue bedroom. This latter door was ajar just a couple of inches, and  through the opening came the sound of a drawer pulled out. For a moment  Carmel thought that Dulcie and Bertha must have come upstairs, and she  was on the point of calling to them, when some strong and mysterious  instinct restrained her. Instead, she walked softly across the floor,  and peeped through the chink. It was no cousin or schoolfellow who was  in the next room, but a slight fair man--an utter stranger--who was  hastily turning over the contents of the drawer, and slipping something  into his pocket.    For a moment Carmel's heart stood still. She realized instantly that she  was in the immediate vicinity of a burglar. Seeing the entertainment  advertised by a placard on the gate, he must have entered the garden and  waited his opportunity to slip into the house while everybody was  outside watching the performance. He was apparently laying light fingers  upon any article which took his fancy.    Carmel's first and most natural impulse was to tear downstairs and give  warning of what was happening. Then it occurred to her that while she  did so the thief would very possibly make his escape. If only she could  trap him. But how? Her fertile brain thought for a second or two, then  evolved a plan.    Very quietly she withdrew the key from the door which led out of her  bedroom to the passage, and locked it on the outside. So far, so good:  if Mr. Burglar went into the dressing-room he could not escape. Now she  must be prepared to take a great risk. The key of the Blue bedroom was  on the inside; she must open the door, withdraw it, and lock it on the  outside before the thief could stop her. It was possible that he had  calculated on the double exit, and that, hearing a noise behind him, he  would make a dash for the dressing-room.    With shaking legs, and something going round and round like a wheel  inside her chest, she approached the Blue bedroom door, and opened it  softly. As she had anticipated, the intruder had probably laid his  plans, for at the first sound he turned his head, then slipped like a  rabbit into the dressing-room. No doubt an unpleasant surprise awaited  him there, for as Carmel's trembling fingers drew out the key, and  locked the door from the passage side she could hear the handle of her  own bedroom door moving.    \"He's probably got skeleton keys, or a jemmy, or something like they use  on the cinema, and will be out in a minute, but I'll get a start of  him!\" she thought, and tearing down stairs like the wind, she literally  flew into the garden, and gasped forth the thrilling news.    \"It's the Blue bedroom--watch the window or he may jump out!\" she added  quickly.    There was an instant rush towards the house; Miss Walters, with Milner  and four other chauffeurs to support her, dashed up stairs, Mr. Bowden  and a crowd of visitors took their stand under the windows. Shouts from  the bedroom presently announced that the burglar had been secured, and  after a while he was led down stairs with his wrists fastened together  by a piece of clothes line, and guarded on each side by two determined  looking men, who hustled him into a car, and drove him off at once to  the police station at Glazebrook.    The excitement at Chilcombe Hall was tremendous. It was of course  impossible to go on with the entertainment. Mistresses, girls, and  guests could do nothing but talk about the occurrence. Carmel was  questioned, and gave as minute and accurate an account as she could of  exactly what had happened. She was much congratulated by everybody on  her presence of mind.    \"I don't know how you dared do it!\" shivered Dulcie. \"He might have shot  you with a revolver!\"    \"You're a brave girl!\" said Miss Walters approvingly. \"If it hadn't been  for your prompt action, in all probability he would have got away.\"    \"I didn't feel brave. I was scared to death!\" admitted Carmel.    Although she would not acknowledge any particular credit in her  achievement, Carmel was necessarily the heroine of the hour. Miss  Walters, feeling that everybody must be in need of refreshment after  such an event, ordered tea to be served immediately, and soon the urns  were carried out into the garden, where tables had already been set with  cups and saucers and plates of sandwiches and cakes.    After a short time Mr. Bowden, who had accompanied the burglar to the  police station, returned to report that their prisoner was safely  quartered in a cell, and a formal charge had been lodged against him,  which in due course of law would lead to his trial for house-breaking.    \"The police think he is not an old offender, but some cyclist who was  passing, and probably yielded to a sudden temptation,\" he explained.  \"Nevertheless, he'll get a sharp sentence, for there has been too much  of this sort of thing going on lately, and the judges are inclined to be  very severe on it, and rightly too, or nobody's home would be safe.  Thank you, Carmel! Yes, I'll take another cup of tea, please! And then I  want to see you do that Sicilian dance before I set off on my travels  again. Oh yes! I'm not going away without!\"    Poor Carmel was still feeling too much upset to relish dancing, but Mr.  Bowden pressed the point, and other guests joined their persuasions, so  finally it was decided to give at least a portion of the second part of  the program, and the audience again took their seats on the lawn,  leaving several people, however, to guard the house.    \"It's not likely there'll be another burglar on the same afternoon;  still, he might have accomplices about,\" said Miss Walters. \"I shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#14)"],[1," natural beauty:--              All that bowery loneliness,    The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring    And bloom profuse and cedar arches.    His imagination was so susceptible to a touch of beauty that even in the  bare sketch he has left for a drama dealing with the story of Lot and his  escape from Sodom we see how likely he was, here also, to fall into the  error of _Comus_. As Lot entertains the angels at supper, \"the Gallantry  of the town passe by in Procession, with musick and song, to the temple  of Venus Urania.\" The opening Chorus is to relate the course of the city,  \"each evening every one with mistresse, or Ganymed, gitterning along the  streets, or solacing on the banks of Jordan, or down the stream.\" But in  the story of the Garden of Eden the beauty was, for once, on the side of  the morality; innocence and purity might be depicted, not, as in a fallen  world, clad in complete steel, but at ease in their native haunts,  surrounded by all the inexhaustible bounty of an unsubdued and  uncorrupted Nature.    The chief dramatic interest of the poem, however, comes in with the great  outcast angel, stirred up by his passions of envy and revenge to assault  the new-created inhabitants of the Garden. It seems likely that Milton  was drawn to this part of his theme by chains of interest and sympathy  stronger than he confessed or knew. He was an epic poet, striving to  describe great events worthily, but the dramatic situation betrayed him.  He knew only that he could draw a rebel leader, noble in bearing,  superbly outlined, a worthy adversary of the Most High. But it happened  to him, as it has happened to others who have found themselves in a  position where Satan could do them a service; before long, as if by some  mediaeval compact, the relations are reversed, and the poet is in the  service of the Devil. He can hardly have foreseen this chance; although  there are not wanting signs in the poem itself that, before it was half  completed, he became uneasily conscious of what was happening, and  attempted, too late, to remedy it. When he chose his subject he doubtless  intended that the centre of interest should be fixed in the Garden of  Eden, and did not perceive how of necessity it must tend to sink lower,  to that realm in the shadow of darkness, innumerably more populous,  inhabited by beings of a nobler origin, of greater (and more human)  passions, with a longer and more distinguished history, and with this  further claim upon the sympathy of the reader, that they are doomed to an  eternity of suffering.    It is worth our while as critics to try to put ourselves in Milton's  place at the time when he had made his choice, that we may realise not  only the attractions but also the difficulties of the theme. An Italian  poet of the early seventeenth century, Giovanni Battista Andreini, from  whose drama, entitled _Adamo_, Milton is alleged to have borrowed some  trifles, has made a very full and satisfactory statement of these  difficulties in the preface to his play. He mentions, for instance, the  unpromising monotony of Adam's life during the time spent in the earthly  paradise, and the difficulty of giving verisimilitude to the conversation  between the woman and the snake. But he waxes most eloquent on the last  and greatest difficulty--\"since the composition must remain deprived of  those poetic ornaments so dear to the Muses; deprived of the power to  draw comparisons from implements of art introduced in the course of  years, since in the time of the first man there was no such thing;  deprived also of naming (at least while Adam speaks or discourse is held  with him), for example, bows, arrows, hatchets, urns, knives, swords,  spears, trumpets, drums, trophies, banners, lists, hammers, torches,  bellows, funeral piles, theatres, exchequers, infinite things of a like  nature, introduced by the necessities of sin;... deprived moreover of  introducing points of history, sacred or profane, of relating fictions of  fabulous deities, of rehearsing loves, furies, sports of hunting or  fishing, triumphs, shipwrecks, conflagrations, enchantments, and things  of a like nature, that are in truth the ornament and the soul of poetry.\"    All these difficulties for Andreini's drama were difficulties also for  Milton's poem. Yet no reader of _Paradise Lost_ is found to complain that  the poem is lacking in poetic ornament. Milton has successfully  surmounted or evaded many of this formidable catalogue of limitations,  without the sacrifice of dramatic propriety. It is true that in the  course of their morning orisons, addressed to their Maker, Adam and Eve  apostrophise the Mists and Exhalations--                              that now rise    From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,    Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold;    --where, a purist might urge, neither of them had any right to be  acquainted with paint, or skirts, or gold. But anachronisms like these  are, after all, only a part of the great anachronism, or postulate  rather, whereby Adam and Eve are made to speak the English tongue. In the  Twelfth Book Michael is guilty of a graver lapse where he mentions  baptism without explanation or apology. On the other hand, Raphael, who  had a pleasanter occasion and more time for his retrospective summary,  explains the military manoeuvring of angels by what Adam had already seen  of the flight of birds, and after describing the great war in Heaven and  the fierce hosting of the opposed forces, ventures, at a later point in  his story, to illustrate the flowing together of the congregated waters  at the Creation by a simile drawn, with apology, from the massing of  troops:--                        As armies at the call    Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)    Troop to their standard, so the watery throng,    Wave rolling after wave.    In the main Milton studies propriety with regard to the forbidden matters  enumerated by Andreini. But he escapes from the full effect of the  prohibition by a variety of devices. In the first place, there are the  two chief episodes of the poem; Raphael's narration, from the Fifth to  the Eighth Book, imparted to Adam as a warning against impending dangers,  and conveying an account of the history of the Universe before the  Creation of Man; and Michael's narration, in the Eleventh and Twelfth  Books, consoling and strengthening Adam, before the Expulsion from the  Garden, by a rapid survey of the prospective history of the World from  that event down to the Millennium. Considered as a narrator, Michael is  very subject to dullness; were it not for the unfailing dignity and  magniloquence of his diction, his tale would be merely a bleak compendium  of the outlines of Scripture history; but to Raphael is committed the  story of the war in Heaven and its amazing sequel,--a story containing  passages so brilliant, and so little necessary to be narrated at length,  that there is some flavour of inconsistency in Milton's apology for his  theme, prefixed to the Ninth Book, where he describes himself as--      Not sedulous by nature to indite    Wars, hitherto the only argument    Heroic deemed, chief mastery to dissect    With long and tedious havoc fabled knights    In battles feigned (the better fortitude    Of patience and heroic martyrdom    Unsung), or to describe races and games    Or tilting furniture, emblazoned shields,    Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,    Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights    At joust and tournament; then marshalled feast    Served up in hall with sewers and seneshals:    The skill of artifice and office mean;    Not that which justly gives heroic name    To person or to poem! Me, of these    Nor skilled nor studious, higher argument    Remains, sufficient of itself to raise    That name, unless an age too late, or cold    Climate, or years, damp my intended wing    Depressed; and much they may if all be mine,    Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear.    To depreciate war as a subject for the heroic Muse was ungrateful in  Milton, who had devoted the whole of his Sixth Book to a description of  the \"wild work in Heaven\" caused by the great rebellion, and had indulged  his imagination with some most extravagant fantasies; such as the digging  in the soil of Heaven for sulphur and nitre (where the soil of Hell, it  may be remarked, yielded gold to the miner), the invention of artillery,  and the use of mountains as missiles,      Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire.    He had, moreover, attained to the height of the sublime in that terrific  closing scene where the Son, riding forth in single majesty, drives the  rebel host over the crystal bounds of Heaven into the wasteful abyss.  Wars, in short, hold a conspicuous place in the poem,--conflicts and  broils so enormous that--                  War seemed a civil game    To this uproar.    Races and athletic sports are among the melancholy diversions of the  dwellers in Hell during their forced leisure. Even tilts and tournaments  are not absent from _Paradise Lost_, but they are introduced by the  second of the devices which enable Milton to extend the scope of his  poem; the free and frequent use, namely, of illustrative and decorative  comparisons. Thus the spacious hall of Pandemonium is compared to--              A covered field, where champions bold    Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair    Defied the best of Panim chivalry    To mortal combat, or career with lance.    It is plain that although almost all of the characters of the poem are  precluded from making allusion to the events of human history, the poet  himself is free; and he uses his freedom throughout. Most of the passages  that have gained for Milton the name of a learned poet are introduced by  way of simile. At times he employs the simplest epic figure, drawn from  the habits of rustic or animal life. But his favourite figure is the  \"long-tailed simile,\" or, as it is"]]]
