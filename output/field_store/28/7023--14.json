When it was over, he raised his eyebrows and  began:    \"My son, what do you seek from me in this dark, cheerless abode? For  many centuries my eyes have seen no human face, and now I wonder what  has led your footsteps hither.\"    The old man answered:    \"I kiss your right hand. My unhappiness has brought me here. I have  lived with my wife many years, but we have no children, and I should  like to have an heir when I behold our Lord's glorious face.\"    The hermit took an apple, and, after having blessed it, cut it in two,  and said:    \"Take these two halves of the apple; give this one to your wife, eat  the other yourself, and in God's name do not wander over the world  so.\"    The old man took the gift, kissed the hermit's right hand and feet,  and left the cave. Entering the dense forest, he walked a long time  before he came to the meadows. There a terrible thirst and burning  sensation in the throat seized upon him. What should he do, for he  found no water? He did precisely what he was destined to do. He took  the half apple and ate it. But instead of the half intended for him,  he ate his wife's. He had scarcely swallowed it when he felt as if he  could go no further. So he sank down on the grass where a quantity of  yellow cheese-wort was growing, and fell sound asleep. And the angel  of the Lord came down from Heaven, and watched beside him. When he  awoke, what did his eyes behold? The wonder of wonders! The most  marvelous of marvels! By his side, among the herbs, a little child was  crying and moving its tiny hands. The angel brought some basil and  some water that had been consecrated nine years, sprinkled the child,  and christened it, giving it the name of \"Little Wild-Rose.\" The old  man, happier than he had ever been at the sight of the pretty little  girl, took her in his arms, kissed her, and set off with her to his  wife. When he reached the house he took a kneading-trough, put the  little thing in it, set it on the roof, and then crawled into the  cottage, saying:    \"Come quick, wife, come quick, and see what a treasure of a daughter,  with golden hair and eyes like stars, our Lord has given me.\"    When they hurried out, to see the treasure of a girl and take the  trough down from the roof, they saw nothing, no trace of the child  anywhere. The old man crossed himself and sighed deeply. He searched  hither and thither, right and left, but the little girl was nowhere to  be found. He hunted through the straw in the hut and on the ground  behind it to see if she had fallen down; but if she wasn't there she  wasn't, and that ended the matter, for they couldn't stamp her out of  the earth.    Oh, heavens, how the old man grieved and wrung his hands in despair.  How could he help being startled by such a thing! He had put the child  in the trough and seen her after he had laid her in it, and knew  exactly where he had left her, and now to be unable to find her just a  moment after was quite too bad.    \"What could have happened to the little girl? Has the angel of the  Lord taken her? Have the elves and wicked gnomes stolen her away?  What in the world could have occurred!\" said the man, sighing.  Somebody had taken her, that was plain. But neither angels nor elves  nor wicked gnomes frequented the neighborhood. Now, my good friends,  just listen to the amazing event. A vulture or a griffin, whichever it  was, but we'll say a griffin, was passing by, and, hearing the child's  cries, swooped swiftly down, seized the little one, tucked her under  its right wing, soared up into the sky with her, and took her to its  eyry to feed its young. After putting her in its nest, the griffin  flew off again. But the young birds, instead of eating the little  girl, looked kindly at her, gave her some soft bread-crumbs, made a  bed for her, and covered her with their wings to protect her from the  chill of the morning air.    I must now tell you that in this terrible forest, at the bottom of a  well of pure poison, lived a dragon with twelve heads, and this well  was not far from the tree in whose top rested the griffin's nest. This  horrible dragon never let the little griffins grow up, but as soon as  they were ready to fly stretched out two of its fiery heads and put an  end to their lives, so that the poor old griffin had never yet, in all  its life, been able to see even one of its children fly off.    The present brood were now full-grown, and were waiting for daylight  to fly through the woods and mountains, when lo, just at midnight the  water of the well made a splashing noise, and what appeared in the  moonlight that flickered through the trees? Two fiery heads, which  approached the nest, setting up such a howling and wailing that the  mountains shook to their foundations and the valleys rocked to and fro  like cradles. Suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, the joints of the  earth and sky trembled and quaked, and the archangel, grasping a sword  in his hand, appeared on a golden cloud, darting downward like a  thunderbolt. Just as the dragon was going to seize the young griffins,  the angel flashed his sword from east to west, and again from west to  east, cutting off both heads as easily as one drinks a spoonful of  water. Then two still more terrible ones came, but they were also  hacked into pieces. Two others next appeared; they, too, were  destroyed, and so fared all the twelve. Blood and poison flowed till  the whole forest and valley were turned into a marsh, and the heads  dashed against the tree which held the nest, so that the leaves fell  from the boughs for ten miles around. The angel took some basil plant,  and sprinkled the four quarters of the earth with water that had been  consecrated in Paradise nine years before. The pools of blood all  gathered into one spot, the heads lost their vitality, and the ground  opened, swallowing them up with all the blood, so that the wood once  more became pure and bright as God meant it to be.    When the griffin came back at dawn, found its children safe in the  nest, and saw that the accursed well had disappeared, it uttered such  a cry of delight that the earth for nine miles round trembled and  shook.    Then it waked the young birds and said:    \"Tell me quickly, my darlings, who has done me this great favor?\"    The young birds shook their heads and replied: \"We don't know any  thing about it, we have been asleep all night.\"    As the griffin looked about, its glance fell upon the little girl,  whose golden hair and starry eyes were glittering in the morning  sunlight like the torches of Paradise, and the thought instantly  darted through its mind that this beautiful light must have rendered  the unspeakable benefit.    \"Children,\" said the griffin, angrily, \"you haven't eaten the little  girl, what does this mean?\" The young birds kept as still as mice, but  the griffin straightway swallowed lovely little Wild-Rose, yet when  she appeared again she was seven times as beautiful as before.    The griffin now set about a great task; all day long it brought  flowers and soft green moss from the woodland meadows to make the  little girl a room like a fairy's nest, and this tiny chamber,  whenever the wind blew, rocked to and fro like a cradle. From this  time little Wild-Rose was as dear to it as its own children, nay, she  was the very apple of the griffin's eye, and it took care of her and  fed her with the very best things a griffin could find.    So the little Wild-Rose with the golden hair began to grow and  flourish like a stately lily. In the morning the merry dawn kissed and  woke her, at noon the shadows of the leafy boughs fanned her, and in  the evening she was lulled to rest by the gentle breezes and the tunes  that echoed through the forest from the shepherds' pipes.    So the little girl grew in beauty till she was able to stand alone,  and one day, just as the evening-star was bathing in the rosy light  left by the sun when it sank behind the mountains, the Lord permitted  what had been predestined to happen, though it was something that had  never occurred before, since this world was created and the sun began  its course through the sky. So it happened that little Wild-Rose stood  up, came out of her little room, and for the first time gazed into the  world. But when she looked at the evening-sky the air quivered, the  rising stars trembled, and on the eastern horizon a second sun, more  beautiful and a hundred times brighter than the one which had set  behind the mountains, rose upward in majesty and splendor as if  mounting from a sea of fire. The forests, chasms and valleys quaked,  the flowers whispered sweetly to each other and turned their little  heads toward the vivifying waves of light. And now behold--the fairest  flowers tried to drink in the little maid's glances, and the trees  around bowed their tops to rejoice in little Wild-Rose's beauty. In  short, the whole of God's creation, the birds in the sky as well as  the beasts in the forest, exulted and jumped for joy over the divine  miracle.    After that evening's festival, twice three days passed, then three  times three, finally still more until little Wild-Rose was fourteen  years old.    At fourteen little Wild-Rose was beautiful--so beautiful that I am  afraid to praise her and describe her perfections, lest you should  afterward say that you had seen some one equally handsome. But there  was no one like her under the sun. Lovely as she was, no human being  had seen her, and she had no idea of empires and cities; she lived on  sisterly terms with the flowers, danced with the butterflies, was  lulled by the murmur of the brook, vied with the birds in singing.  Now, my dear readers, forgive me for first telling you I would say  nothing, and afterward adding a few words in praise of little  Wild-Rose. Who that has ever seen her can help talking about her?    So the days passed like hours and the hours like minutes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#14)"],[1,"   than the ephemeral glory of men who only maintain their reputation    by sharing in the errors of their time.      \"Honor to thee! Respect to thy memory! Thou hast died in the breach    while fighting for truth, and the truth assures thee immortality.\"    Lamarck's theoretical views were not known in Germany until many years  after his death. Had Goethe, his contemporary (1749-1832), known of  them, he would undoubtedly have welcomed his speculations, have  expressed his appreciation of them, and Lamarck's reputation would, in  his own lifetime, have raised him from the obscurity of his later years  at Paris.    Hearty appreciation, though late in the century, came from Ernst  Haeckel, whose bold and suggestive works have been so widely read. In  his _History of Creation_ (1868) he thus estimates Lamarck's work as a  philosopher:      \"To him will always belong the immortal glory of having for the    first time worked out the theory of descent, as an independent    scientific theory of the first order, and as the philosophical    foundation of the whole science of biology.\"    Referring to the _Philosophie Zoologique_, he says:      \"This admirable work is the first connected exposition of the theory    of descent carried out strictly into all its consequences. By its    purely mechanical method of viewing organic nature, and the strictly    philosophical proofs brought forward in it, Lamarck's work is raised    far above the prevailing dualistic views of his time; and with the    exception of Darwin's work, which appeared just half a century    later, we know of none which we could, in this respect, place by the    side of the _Philosophie Zoologique_. How far it was in advance of    its time is perhaps best seen from the circumstance that it was not    understood by most men, and for fifty years was not spoken of at    all. Cuvier, Lamarck's greatest opponent, in his _Report on the    Progress of Natural Science_, in which the most unimportant    anatomical investigations are enumerated, does not devote a single    word to this work, which forms an epoch in science. Goethe, also,    who took such a lively interest in the French nature-philosophy and    in the 'thoughts of kindred minds beyond the Rhine,' nowhere    mentions Lamarck, and does not seem to have known the _Philosophie    Zoologique_ at all.\"    Again in 1882 Haeckel writes:[55]      \"We regard it as a truly tragic fact that the _Philosophie    Zoologique_ of Lamarck, one of the greatest productions of the great    literary period of the beginning of our century, received at first    only the slightest notice, and within a few years became wholly    forgotten.... Not until fully fifty years later, when Darwin    breathed new life into the transformation views founded therein, was    the buried treasure again recovered, and we cannot refrain from    regarding it as the most complete presentation of the development    theory before Darwin.      \"While Lamarck clearly expressed all the essential fundamental ideas    of our present doctrine of descent; and excites our admiration at    the depth of his morphological knowledge, he none the less surprises    us by the prophetic (_vorausschauende_) clearness of his    physiological conceptions.\"    In his views on life, the nature of the will and reason, and other  subjects, Haeckel declares that Lamarck was far above most of his  contemporaries, and that he sketched out a programme of the biology of  the future which was not carried out until our day.    J. Victor Carus[56] also claims for Lamarck \"the lasting merit of having  been the first to have placed the theory (of descent) on a scientific  foundation.\"    The best, most catholic, and just exposition of Lamarck's views, and  which is still worth reading, is that by Lyell Chapters XXXIV.-XXXVI. of  his _Principles of Geology_, 1830, and though at that time one would not  look for an acceptance of views which then seemed extraordinary and,  indeed, far-fetched, Lyell had no words of satire and ridicule, only a  calm, able statement and discussion of his principles. Indeed, it is  well known that when, in after years, his friend Charles Darwin  published his views, Lyell expressed some leaning towards the older  speculations of Lamarck.    Lyell's opinions as to the interest and value of Lamarck's ideas may be  found in his _Life and Letters_, and also in the _Life and Letters of  Charles Darwin_. In the chapter, _On the Reception of the Origin of  Species_, by Huxley, are the following extracts from Lyell's _Letters_  (ii., pp. 179-204). In a letter addressed to Mantell (dated March 2,  1827), Lyell speaks of having just read Lamarck; he expresses his  delight at Lamarck's theories, and his personal freedom from any  objections based on theological grounds. And though he is evidently  alarmed at the pithecoid origin of man involved in Lamarck's doctrine,  he observes: \"But, after all, what changes species may really undergo!  How impossible will it be to distinguish and lay down a line beyond  which some of the so-called extinct species have never passed into  recent ones?\"    He also quotes a remarkable passage in the postscript to a letter  written to Sir John Herschel in 1836: \"In regard to the origination of  new species, I am very glad to find that you think it probable it may be  carried on through the intervention of intermediate causes.\"    How nearly Lyell was made a convert to evolution by reading Lamarck's  works may be seen by the following extracts from his letters, quoted by  Huxley:      \"I think the old 'creation' is almost as much required as ever, but    of course it takes a new form if Lamarck's views, improved by yours,    are adopted.\" (To Darwin, March 11, 1863, p. 363.)           ~       ~       ~       ~       ~      \"As to Lamarck, I find that Grove, who has been reading him, is    wonderfully struck with his book. I remember that it was the    conclusion he (Lamarck) came to about man, that fortified me thirty    years ago against the great impression which his argument at first    made on my mind--all the greater because Constant Prevost, a pupil    of Cuvier forty years ago, told me his conviction 'that Cuvier    thought species not real, but that science could not advance without    assuming that they were so.'\"           ~       ~       ~       ~       ~      \"When I came to the conclusion that after all Lamarck was going to    be shown to be right, that we must 'go the whole orang,' I re-read    his book, and remembering when it was written, I felt I had done    him injustice.      \"Even as to man's gradual acquisition of more and more ideas, and    then of speech slowly as the ideas multiplied, and then his    persecution of the beings most nearly allied and competing with    him--all this is very Darwinian.      \"The substitution of the variety-making power for 'volition,'    'muscular action,' etc. (and in plants even volition was not called    in), is in some respects only a change of names. Call a new variety    a new creation, one may say of the former, as of the latter, what    you say when you observe that the creationist explains nothing, and    only affirms 'it is so because it is so.'      \"Lamarck's belief in the slow changes in the organic and inorganic    world in the year 1800 was surely above the standard of his times,    and he was right about progression in the main, though you have    vastly advanced that doctrine. As to Owen in his 'Aye Aye' paper, he    seems to me a disciple of Pouchet, who converted him at Rouen to    'spontaneous generation.'      \"Have I not, at p. 412, put the vast distinction between you and    Lamarck as to 'necessary progression' strongly enough?\" (To Darwin,    March 15, 1863. _Lyell's Letters_, ii., p. 365.)    Darwin, in the freedom of private correspondence, paid scant respect to  the views of his renowned predecessor, as the following extracts from  his published letters will show:      \"Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a 'tendency to    progression,' 'adaptations from the slow willing of animals,' etc.    But the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his;    though the means of change are wholly so.\" (Darwin's _Life and    Letters_, ii., p. 23, 1844.)           ~       ~       ~       ~       ~      \"With respect to books on this subject, I do not know of any    systematical ones, except Lamarck's, which is veritable rubbish....    Is it not strange that the author of such a book as the _Animaux    sans Vertebres_ should have written that insects, which never see    their eggs, should _will_ (and plants, their seeds) to be of    particular forms, so as to become attached to particular    objects.\"[57] (ii., p. 29, 1844.)           ~       ~       ~       ~       ~      \"Lamarck is the only exception, that I can think of, of an accurate    describer of species, at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has    disbelieved in permanent species, but he in his absurd though clever    work has done the subject harm.\" (ii., p. 39, no date.)           ~       ~       ~       ~       ~      \"To talk of climate or Lamarckian habit producing such adaptions to    other organic beings is futile.\" (ii., p. 121, 1858.)    On the other hand, another great English thinker and naturalist of rare  breadth and catholicity, and despite the fact that he rejected Lamarck's  peculiar evolutional views, associated him with the most eminent  biologists.    In a letter to Romanes, dated in 1882, Huxley thus estimates Lamarck's  position in the scientific world:      \"I am not likely to take a low view of Darwin's position in the    history of science, but I am disposed to think that Buffon and    Lamarck would run him hard in both genius and fertility. In breadth    of view and in extent of knowledge these two men were giants, though    we are apt to forget their services. Von Baer was another man of the    same stamp; Cuvier, in a somewhat lower rank, another;"]]]
