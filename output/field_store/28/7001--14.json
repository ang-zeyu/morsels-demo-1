She was plainly an American, and he occasionally  had the feeling that he had seen every one in America when he had  worked for the _Chronicle_.    \"That's right,\" he said approvingly. \"Always look on the bright  side.\"    \"I only arrived in London yesterday,\" said the girl, \"and I  haven't got used to your keeping-to-the-left rules. I don't  suppose I shall ever get back to New York alive. Perhaps, as you  have saved my life, you wouldn't mind doing me another service.  Can you tell me which is the nearest and safest way to a  restaurant called the Regent Grill?\"    \"It's just over there, at the corner of Regent Street. As to the  safest way, if I were you I should cross over at the top of the  street there and then work round westward. Otherwise you will have  to cross Piccadilly Circus.\"    \"I absolutely refuse even to try to cross Piccadilly Circus.  Thank you very much. I will follow your advice. I hope I shall  get there. It doesn't seem at all likely.\"    She gave him a little nod, and moved away. Jimmy turned into that  drug-store at the top of the Haymarket at which so many Londoners  have found healing and comfort on the morning after, and bought  the pink drink for which his system had been craving since he  rose from bed. He wondered why, as he drained it, he should feel  ashamed and guilty.    A few minutes later he found himself, with mild surprise, going  down the steps of the Regent Grill. It was the last place he had  had in his mind when he had left the steamship company's offices  in quest of lunch. He had intended to seek out some quiet,  restful nook where he could be alone with his thoughts. If  anybody had told him then that five minutes later he would be  placing himself of his own free will within the range of a  restaurant orchestra playing \"My Little Grey Home in the  West\"--and the orchestra at the Regent played little else--he  would not have believed him.    Restaurants in all large cities have their ups and downs. At this  time the Regent Grill was enjoying one of those bursts of  popularity for which restaurateurs pray to whatever strange gods  they worship. The more prosperous section of London's Bohemia  flocked to it daily. When Jimmy had deposited his hat with the  robber-band who had their cave just inside the main entrance and  had entered the grill-room, he found it congested. There did not  appear to be a single unoccupied table.    From where he stood he could see the girl of the red-gold hair.  Her back was towards him, and she was sitting at a table against  one of the pillars with a little man with eye-glasses, a handsome  woman in the forties, and a small stout boy who was skirmishing  with the olives. As Jimmy hesitated, the vigilant head-waiter,  who knew him well, perceived him, and hurried up.    \"In one moment, Mister Crockaire!\" he said, and began to scatter  commands among the underlings. \"I will place a table for you in  the aisle.\"    \"Next to that pillar, please,\" said Jimmy.    The underlings had produced a small table--apparently from up  their sleeves, and were draping it in a cloth. Jimmy sat down and  gave his order. Ordering was going on at the other table. The  little man seemed depressed at the discovery that corn on the cob  and soft-shelled crabs were not to be obtained, and his wife's  reception of the news that clams were not included in the  Regent's bill-of-fare was so indignant that one would have said  that she regarded the fact as evidence that Great Britain was  going to pieces and would shortly lose her place as a world  power.    A selection having finally been agreed upon, the orchestra struck  up \"My Little Grey Home in the West,\" and no attempt was made to  compete with it. When the last lingering strains had died away  and the violinist-leader, having straightened out the kinks in  his person which the rendition of the melody never failed to  produce, had bowed for the last time, a clear, musical voice  spoke from the other side of the pillar.    \"Jimmy Crocker is a WORM!\"    Jimmy spilled his cocktail. It might have been the voice of  Conscience.    \"I despise him more than any one on earth. I hate to think that  he's an American.\"    Jimmy drank the few drops that remained in his glass, partly to  make sure of them, partly as a restorative. It is an unnerving  thing to be despised by a red-haired girl whose life you have  just saved. To Jimmy it was not only unnerving; it was uncanny.  This girl had not known him when they met on the street a few  moments before. How then was she able to display such intimate  acquaintance with his character now as to describe him--justly  enough--as a worm? Mingled with the mystery of the thing was its  pathos. The thought that a girl could be as pretty as this one  and yet dislike him so much was one of the saddest things Jimmy  had ever come across. It was like one of those Things Which Make  Me Weep In This Great City so dear to the hearts of the  sob-writers of his late newspaper.    A waiter bustled up with a high-ball. Jimmy thanked him with his  eyes. He needed it. He raised it to his lips.    \"He's always drinking--\"    He set it down hurriedly.    \"--and making a disgraceful exhibition of himself in public! I  always think Jimmy Crocker--\"    Jimmy began to wish that somebody would stop this girl. Why  couldn't the little man change the subject to the weather, or  that stout child start prattling about some general topic? Surely  a boy of that age, newly arrived in London, must have all sorts  of things to prattle about? But the little man was dealing  strenuously with a breaded cutlet, while the stout boy, grimly  silent, surrounded fish-pie in the forthright manner of a  starving python. As for the elder woman, she seemed to be  wrestling with unpleasant thoughts, beyond speech.    \"--I always think that Jimmy Crocker is the worst case I know of  the kind of American young man who spends all his time in Europe  and tries to become an imitation Englishman. Most of them are the  sort any country would be glad to get rid of, but he used to work  once, so you can't excuse him on the ground that he hasn't the  sense to know what he's doing. He's deliberately chosen to loaf  about London and make a pest of himself. He went to pieces with  his eyes open. He's a perfect, utter, hopeless WORM!\"    Jimmy had never been very fond of the orchestra at the Regent  Grill, holding the view that it interfered with conversation and  made for an unhygienic rapidity of mastication; but he was  profoundly grateful to it now for bursting suddenly into _La  Boheme_, the loudest item in its repertory. Under cover of that  protective din he was able to toy with a steaming dish which his  waiter had brought. Probably that girl was saying all sorts of  things about him still but he could not hear them.    The music died away. For a moment the tortured air quivered in  comparative silence; then the girl's voice spoke again. She had,  however, selected another topic of conversation.    \"I've seen all I want to of England,\" she said, \"I've seen  Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament and His Majesty's  Theatre and the Savoy and the Cheshire Cheese, and I've developed  a frightful home-sickness. Why shouldn't we go back to-morrow?\"    For the first time in the proceedings the elder woman spoke. She  cast aside her mantle of gloom long enough to say \"Yes,\" then  wrapped it round her again. The little man, who had apparently  been waiting for her vote before giving his own, said that the  sooner he was on board a New York-bound boat the better he would  be pleased. The stout boy said nothing. He had finished his  fish-pie, and was now attacking jam roll with a sort of morose  resolution.    \"There's certain to be a boat,\" said the girl. \"There always is.  You've got to say that for England--it's an easy place to get back  to America from.\" She paused. \"What I can't understand is how,  after having been in America and knowing what it was like, Jimmy  Crocker could stand living . . .\"    The waiter had come to Jimmy's side, bearing cheese; but Jimmy  looked at it with dislike and shook his head in silent negation.  He was about to depart from this place. His capacity for  absorbing home-truths about himself was exhausted. He placed a  noiseless sovereign on the table, caught the waiter's eye,  registered renunciation, and departed soft-footed down the aisle.  The waiter, a man who had never been able to bring himself to  believe in miracles, revised the views of a life-time. He looked  at the sovereign, then at Jimmy, then at the sovereign again.  Then he took up the coin and bit it furtively.    A few minutes later, a hat-check boy, untipped for the first time  in his predatory career, was staring at Jimmy with equal  intensity, but with far different feelings. Speechless concern  was limned on his young face.    The commissionaire at the Piccadilly entrance of the restaurant  touched his hat ingratiatingly, with the smug confidence of a man  who is accustomed to getting sixpence a time for doing it.    \"Taxi, Mr. Crocker?\"    \"A worm,\" said Jimmy.    \"Beg pardon, sir?\"    \"Always drinking,\" explained Jimmy, \"and making a pest of  himself.\"    He passed on. The commissionaire stared after him as intently as  the waiter and the hat-check boy. He had sometimes known Mr.  Crocker like this after supper, but never before during the  luncheon hour.    Jimmy made his way to his club in Northumberland Avenue. For  perhaps half an hour he sat in a condition of coma in the  smoking-room; then, his mind made up, he went to one of the  writing-tables. He sat awaiting inspiration for some minutes,  then began to write.    The letter he wrote was to his father:      Dear Dad:    I have been thinking over what we talked about this  morning, and it seems to me the best thing I can do is to  drop out of sight for a brief space. If I stay on in  London, I am likely at any moment to pull some boner like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#14)"],[1,"and imbecile.  You profess to see,  whereas you can see nothing but a Point!  You plume yourself on  inferring the existence of a Straight Line; but I CAN SEE Straight  Lines, and infer the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares,  Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles.  Why waste more words?  Suffice  it that I am the completion of your incomplete self.  You are a Line,  but I am a Line of Lines, called in my country a Square:  and even I,  infinitely superior though I am to you, am of little account among the  great nobles of Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope  of enlightening your ignorance.\"    Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as  if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same moment there  arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing  in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of  a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand  Pentagons.  Spell-bound and motionless, I could neither speak nor move  to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder,  and the King came closer, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell  recalling me to the realities of Flatland.          Section 15.  Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland        From dreams I proceed to facts.    It was the last day of the 1999th year of our era.  The pattering of  the rain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting in the  company of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the prospects  of the coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.    [Note:  When I say \"sitting\", of course I do not mean any change of  attitude such as you in Spaceland signify by that word; for as we have  no feet, we can no more \"sit\" nor \"stand\" (in your sense of the word)  than one of your soles or flounders.    Nevertheless, we perfectly well recognize the different mental states  of volition implied in \"lying\", \"sitting\", and \"standing\", which are to  some extent indicated to a beholder by a slight increase of lustre  corresponding to the increase of volition.    But on this, and a thousand other kindred subjects, time forbids me to  dwell.]    My four Sons and two orphan Grandchildren had retired to their several  apartments; and my wife alone remained with me to see the old  Millennium out and the new one in.    I was rapt in thought, pondering in my mind some words that had  casually issued from the mouth of my youngest Grandson, a most  promising young Hexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity.  His uncles and I had been giving him his usual practical lesson in  Sight Recognition, turning ourselves upon our centres, now rapidly, now  more slowly, and questioning him as to our positions; and his answers  had been so satisfactory that I had been induced to reward him by  giving him a few hints on Arithmetic, as applied to Geometry.    Taking nine Squares, each an inch every way, I had put them together so  as to make one large Square, with a side of three inches, and I had  hence proved to my little Grandson that--though it was impossible for  us to SEE the inside of the Square--yet we might ascertain the number  of square inches in a Square by simply squaring the number of inches in  the side:  \"and thus,\" said I, \"we know that 3^2, or 9, represents the  number of square inches in a Square whose side is 3 inches long.\"    The little Hexagon meditated on this a while and then said to me; \"But  you have been teaching me to raise numbers to the third power: I  suppose 3^3 must mean something in Geometry; what does it mean?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" replied I, \"not at least in Geometry; for Geometry  has only Two Dimensions.\"  And then I began to shew the boy how a Point  by moving through a length of three inches makes a Line of three  inches, which may be represented by 3; and how a Line of three inches,  moving parallel to itself through a length of three inches, makes a  Square of three inches every way, which may be represented by 3^2.    Upon this, my Grandson, again returning to his former suggestion, took  me up rather suddenly and exclaimed, \"Well, then, if a Point by moving  three inches, makes a Line of three inches represented by 3; and if a  straight Line of three inches, moving parallel to itself, makes a  Square of three inches every way, represented by 3^2; it must be that a  Square of three inches every way, moving somehow parallel to itself  (but I don't see how) must make Something else (but I don't see what)  of three inches every way--and this must be represented by 3^3.\"    \"Go to bed,\" said I, a little ruffled by this interruption: \"if you  would talk less nonsense, you would remember more sense.\"    So my Grandson had disappeared in disgrace; and there I sat by my  Wife's side, endeavouring to form a retrospect of the year 1999 and of  the possibilities of the year 2000, but not quite able to shake off the  thoughts suggested by the prattle of my bright little Hexagon.  Only a  few sands now remained in the half-hour glass.  Rousing myself from my  reverie I turned the glass Northward for the last time in the old  Millennium; and in the act, I exclaimed aloud, \"The boy is a fool.\"    Straightway I became conscious of a Presence in the room, and a  chilling breath thrilled through my very being.  \"He is no such thing,\"  cried my Wife, \"and you are breaking the Commandments in thus  dishonouring your own Grandson.\" But I took no notice of her.  Looking  round in every direction I could see nothing; yet still I FELT a  Presence, and shivered as the cold whisper came again.  I started up.  \"What is the matter?\" said my Wife, \"there is no draught; what are you  looking for?  There is nothing.\"  There was nothing; and I resumed my  seat, again exclaiming, \"The boy is a fool, I say; 3^3 can have no  meaning in Geometry.\"  At once there came a distinctly audible reply,  \"The boy is not a fool; and 3^3 has an obvious Geometrical meaning.\"    My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not  understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the  direction of the sound.  What was our horror when we saw before us a  Figure!  At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways;  but a moment's observation shewed me that the extremities passed into  dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should  have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a  manner impossible for a Circle or for any regular Figure of which I had  had experience.    But my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary to note  these characteristics.  With the usual hastiness and unreasoning  jealousy of her Sex, she flew at once to the conclusion that a Woman  had entered the house through some small aperture.  \"How comes this  person here?\" she exclaimed, \"you promised me, my dear, that there  should be no ventilators in our new house.\" \"Nor are there any,\" said  I; \"but what makes you think that the stranger is a Woman?  I see by my  power of Sight Recognition----\" \"Oh, I have no patience with your Sight  Recognition,\" replied she, \"'Feeling is believing' and 'A Straight Line  to the touch is worth a Circle to the sight'\"--two Proverbs, very  common with the Frailer Sex in Flatland.    \"Well,\" said I, for I was afraid of irritating her, \"if it must be so,  demand an introduction.\"  Assuming her most gracious manner, my Wife  advanced towards the Stranger, \"Permit me, Madam, to feel and be felt  by----\" then, suddenly recoiling, \"Oh!  it is not a Woman, and there  are no angles either, not a trace of one.  Can it be that I have so  misbehaved to a perfect Circle?\"    \"I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle,\" replied the Voice, \"and a  more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately,  I am many Circles in one.\"  Then he added more mildly, \"I have a  message, dear Madam, to your husband, which I must not deliver in your  presence; and, if you would suffer us to retire for a few minutes----\"  But my Wife would not listen to the proposal that our august Visitor  should so incommode himself, and assuring the Circle that the hour of  her own retirement had long passed, with many reiterated apologies for  her recent indiscretion, she at last retreated to her apartment.    I glanced at the half-hour glass.  The last sands had fallen.  The  third Millennium had begun.          Section 16.  How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me                 in words the mysteries of Spaceland        As soon as the sound of the Peace-cry of my departing Wife had died  away, I began to approach the Stranger with the intention of taking a  nearer view and of bidding him be seated: but his appearance struck me  dumb and motionless with astonishment.  Without the slightest symptoms  of angularity he nevertheless varied every instant with gradations of  size and brightness scarcely possible for any Figure within the scope  of my experience.  The thought flashed across me that I might have  before me a burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous Irregular Isosceles,  who, by feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow  into the house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.    In a sitting-room, the absence of Fog (and the season happened to be  remarkably dry), made it difficult for me to trust to Sight  Recognition, especially at the short distance at which I was standing.  Desperate with fear, I rushed forward with an unceremonious, \"You must  permit me, Sir--\" and felt him.  My Wife was right.  There was not the  trace of an angle, not the slightest roughness or inequality:  never in  my life had I met with a more perfect Circle.  He remained motionless  while I walked round him, beginning from his eye and returning to it  again.  Circular he was throughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle;  there could not be a doubt of it.  Then followed a dialogue, which I  will endeavour to"]]]
