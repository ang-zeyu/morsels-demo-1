Thy hill-tops, New England, shall leap at the cry,  And the prairie and far distant south shall reply;  It shall roll o'er the land till the farthermost glen  Gives back the glad summons again and again.    Oppression shall hear in its temple of blood,  And read on its wall the handwriting of God;  Niagara's torrent shall thunder it forth,  It shall burn in the sentinel star of the North.    It shall blaze in the lightning, and speak in the thunder,  Till Slavery's fetters are riven asunder,  And freedom her rights has triumphantly won,  And our country her garments of beauty put on.      Then huzza, then huzza,  Truth's glittering falchion for freedom we draw.    Let them blacken our names, and pursue us with ill,  We bow at thy altar, sweet liberty still!  As the breeze f'm the mountain sweeps over the river,  So, changeless and free, shall our thoughts be, for ever.    Then on to the conflict for freedom and truth;  Come Matron, come Maiden, come Manhood and youth,  Come gather! come gather! come one and come all,  And soon shall the altars of Slavery fall.    The forests shall know it, and lift up their voice,  To bid the green prairies and valleys rejoice;  And the \"Father of Waters,\" join Mexico's sea,  In the anthem of Nature for millions set free.      Then huzza! then huzza!  Truth's glittering falchion for freedom we draw.          Be kind to each other.    BY CHARLES SWAIN.      Be kind to each other!    The night's coming on,  When friend and when brother    Perchance may be gone!  Then 'midst our dejection,    How sweet to have earned  The blest recollection,    Of kindness--returned!    When day hath departed,    And memory keeps  Her watch, broken-hearted,    Where all she loved sleeps!  Let falsehood assail not,    Nor envy disprove--  Let trifles prevail not    Against those ye love!    Nor change with to-morrow,    Should fortune take wing,  But the deeper the sorrow,    The closer still cling!  Oh! be kind to each other!    The night's coming on,  When friend and when brother    Perchance may be gone.          PRAISE AND PRAYER.    Words by Miss Chandler.      [Music]    Praise for slumbers of the night,  For the wakening morning's light,  For the board with plenty spread,  Gladness o'er the spirit shed;  Healthful pulse and cloudless eye,  Opening on the smiling sky.    Praise! for loving hearts that still  With life's bounding pulses thrill;  Praise, that still our own may know--  Earthly joy and earthly woe.  Praise for every varied good,  Bounteous round our pathway strew'd!    Prayer! for grateful hearts to raise  Incense meet of prayer and praise!  Prayer, for spirits calm and meek,  Wisdom life's best joys to seek;  Strength 'midst devious paths to tread--  That through which the Saviour led.    Prayer! for those who, day by day,  Weep their bitter life away;  Prayer, for those who bind the chain  Rudely on their throbbing vein--  That repentance deep may win  Pardon for the fearful sin!          THE SLAVE'S LAMENTATION.    A Parody by Tucker. Air, \"Long, long ago.\"      [Music]    Where are the friends that to me were so dear,      Long, long ago, long, long ago!  Where are the hopes that my heart used to cheer?      Long, long ago, long, long ago!  Friends that I loved in the grave are laid low,  All hope of freedom hath fled from me now.  I am degraded, for man was my foe,      Long, long ago, long, long ago!    Sadly my wife bowed her beautiful head--      Long, long ago--long ago!  Oh, how I wept when I found she was dead!      Long, long ago--long ago!  She was my angel, my love and my pride--  Vainly to save her from torture I tried,  Poor broken heart! She rejoiced as she died,      Long, long ago--long, long ago!    Let me look back on the days of my youth--      Long, long ago--long ago!  Master withheld from me knowledge and truth--      Long, long ago--long ago!  Crushed all the hopes of my earliest day,  Sent me from father and mother away--  Forbade me to read, nor allowed me to pray--      Long, long ago--long, long ago!          THE STRANGER AND HIS FRIEND.    Montgomery and Denison. Tune, \"Duane Street.\"      [Music]    A poor wayfaring man of grief,    Hath often crossed me on my way,  Who sued so humbly for relief,    That I could never answer nay;  I had not power to ask his name,  Whither he went or whence he came;  Yet there was something in his eye,  Which won my love, I knew not why.    Once, when my scanty meal was spread,    He entered--not a word he spake--  Just perishing for want of bread,    I gave him all; he blessed it, brake,  And ate, but gave me part again:  Mine was an angel's portion then,  For while I fed with eager haste,  The crust was manna to my taste.    'Twas night. The floods were out, it blew    A winter hurricane aloof:  I heard his voice abroad, and flew    To bid him welcome to my roof;  I warmed, I clothed, I cheered my guest,  I laid him on my couch to rest:  Then made the ground my bed and seemed  In Eden's garden while I dreamed.    I saw him bleeding in his chains,    And tortured 'neath the driver's lash,  His sweat fell fast along the plains,    Deep dyed from many a fearful gash:  But I in bonds remembered him,  And strove to free each fettered limb,  As with my tears I washed his blood,  Me he baptized with mercy's flood.    I saw him in the negro pew,    His head hung low upon his breast,  His locks were wet with drops of dew,    Gathered while he for entrance pressed  Within those aisles, whose courts are given  That black and white may reach one heaven;  And as I meekly sought his feet,  He smiled, and made a throne my seat.    In prison I saw him next condemned    To meet a traitor's doom at morn;  The tide of lying tongues I stemmed,    And honored him midst shame and scorn.  My friendship's utmost zeal to try,  He asked if I for him would die;  The flesh was weak, my blood ran chill,  But the free spirit cried, \"I will.\"    Then in a moment to my view,    The stranger darted from disguise;  The tokens in his hands I knew,    My Saviour stood before my eyes!  He spoke, and my poor name he named--  \"Of me thou hast not been ashamed,  These deeds shall thy memorial be;  Fear not, thou didst them unto me.\"          WE'RE FOR FREEDOM THROUGH THE LAND.    Words by J.E. Robinson. Music arranged from the \"Old Granite State.\"      [Music]    We are coming, we are coming! freedom's battle is begun!  No hand shall furl her banner ere her victory be won!  Our shields are locked for liberty, and mercy goes before:  Tyrants tremble in your citadel! oppression shall be o'er.      We will vote for Birney,      We will vote for Birney,      We're for Morris and for Birney,      And for Freedom through the land.    We have hatred, dark and deep, for the fetter and the thong;  We bring light for prisoned spirits, for the captive's wail a song;  We are coming, we are coming! and, \"No league with tyrant man,\"  Is emblazoned on our banner, while Jehovah leads the van!      We will vote for Birney,      We will vote for Birney,      We're for Morris and for Birney,      And for Freedom through the land!    We are coming, we are coming! but we wield no battle brand:  We are armed with truth and justice, with God's charter in our hand,  And our voice which swells for freedom--freedom now and ever more--  Shall be heard as ocean's thunder, when they burst upon the shore!      We will vote for Birney,      We will vote for Birney,      We're for Morris and for Birney,      And for Freedom through the land.    Be patient, O, be patient! ye suffering ones of earth!  Denied a glorious heritage--our common right by birth;  With fettered limbs and spirits, your battle shall be won!  O be patient--we are coming! suffer on, suffer on!      We will vote for Birney,      We will vote for Birney,      We're for Morris and for Birney,      And for Freedom through the land.    We are coming, we are coming! not as comes the tempest's wrath,  When the frown of desolation sits brooding o'er its path;  But with mercy, such as leaves his holy signet-light upon  The air in lambent beauty, when the darkened storm is gone.      We will vote for Birney,      We will vote for Birney,      We're for Morris and for Birney,      And for Freedom through the land.    O, be patient in your misery! be mute in your despair!  While your chains are grinding deeper, there's a voice upon the air!  Ye shall feel its potent echoes, ye shall hear its lovely sound,  We are coming! we are coming! bringing freedom to the bound!      We will vote for Birney,      We will vote for Birney,      We're for Morris and for Birney,      And for Freedom through the land.         NOTE.--Suggested by a song sung by George W.

[Music]    Sister, thou art worn and weary,    Toiling for another's gain;  Life with thee is dark and dreary,    Filled with wretchedness and pain,  Thou must rise at dawn of light,    And thy daily task pursue,  Till the darkness of the night    Hide thy labors from thy view.    Oft, alas! thou hast to bear    Sufferings more than tongue can tell;  Thy oppressor will not spare,    But delights thy griefs to swell;  Oft thy back the scourge has felt,    Then to God thou'st raised the cry  That the tyrant's heart he'd melt    Ere thou should'st in tortures die.    Injured sister, well we know    That thy lot in life is hard;  Sad thy state of toil and wo,    From all blessedness debarred;  While each sympathizing heart    Pities thy forlorn distress;  We would sweet relief impart,    And delight thy soul to bless.    And what lies within our power    We most cheerfully will do,  That will haste the blissful hour    Fraught with news of joy to you;  And when comes the happy day    That shall free our captive friend,  When Jehovah's mighty sway "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22096"],[0,"Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children (#14)"],[1,"come from the lodge.    Never since Morning Star began to fish with her basket, had Chief Little  Wolf, her father, had to wait for his fish breakfast before starting on  the chase. But one morning, neither Chief Little Wolf nor Morning Star  breakfasted on fish. This is how it happened.    On this morning, the Indian girl was up as usual with the sun. She ran  down the river just as the Great Spirit lifted the sun's smiling face.  Morning Star had such a light heart that she was glad just to be alive,  and she sang a song of praise as she ran. All true Indians at sunrise  lift their arms and faces to the sun, and thank the Great Spirit that he  has smiled upon them again.    Happy and fleet as a deer, Morning Star ran on until she came to the  great rocks. There she saw a whole tribe of tiny little folk gathered  about her basket. Some of them were perched on the sides of the basket,  laughing and singing. Others were lifting the fish from it and throwing  them into the stream. Still others were opening and closing the splints  of the basket for the fish to slip through.    Morning Star knew that these tiny folk were the _Jo gah oh_. She knew  also that these Little People were friends of the fish. They know every  twist of a fish net and every turn of a hook. Often they have been known  to set fish free, and to guide them into deep, quiet places, far away  from the men who fish.    Morning Star called to the Little People and begged them not to let all  the fish go. Then she began to climb down the rocks, as fast as she  could. The little Chief called up to her, \"Fish, like Indian girls, like  to be alive.\"    Then he told the Little People to keep on setting the fish free.    When Morning Star reached her basket, a few fish were still in it. She  put out her hand to take them from the Little People,--and not a fish,  nor a _Jo gah oh_ was to be seen. The Little People had darted into  the rocks, for they go through anything, and the fish had slipped  through the tiny spaces between the splints of the basket.    [Illustration]    Morning Star heard the laughter of the Little People echo deep within  the rocks, for they like to play pranks with the earth children. And far  down the stream, she saw the fish leap with joy at being still alive.  She took up her empty basket and went back to the wigwam.    That morning for breakfast, Morning Star baked corn cakes on the hot  coals. As she ate the hot cakes, she thought they tasted almost as good  as fish.    Ever after, when Morning Star saw a fish leap from the stream, she  remembered what the _Jo gah oh_ had said: \"Fish, like Indian girls, like  to be alive.\"          HOW LITTLE SHOOTER LOST HIS LUCK      One day, an Indian boy was playing beside a stream, when one of the  little elf men came along in his canoe. The boy had his bow and arrow  with him; so had the little elf man.    The little man stopped and offered to trade bows and arrows. The Indian  boy looked first at his bow, and then at that of the little man. His bow  was large. The little man's bow was very small. The boy thought his own  bow was better, so he said he would not trade.    The little elf man laughed and drew his bow.    \"You think only big things are great,\" he said. \"Some day you will learn  better. Some day you will want this little bow and these little arrows.  Some day you will wish you had traded.\"    Then he shot an arrow into the clouds, sprang into his canoe, and  paddled off up the stream. As he disappeared, he called back to the boy,  \"You will see me again, sometime!\"    The Indian boy ran to his wigwam home. He told his father about the  little man he had seen, and how the man wanted to trade bow and arrows.    \"And you did not trade?\" exclaimed the father.    \"No,\" said the boy, \"his bow was small; mine is large.\"    \"Foolish boy!\" said the father. \"That little man was a _Jo gah oh_, one  of the Little People. They do wonderful things. Their arrows are winged  with power. Had you traded bows, you would have become a great hunter,  and been able to get near the animals.    \"Those little arrows of the _Jo gah oh_ fly swift and far, and always  bring back game. The boy who has a _Jo gah oh_ bow and arrow always has  good luck. One arrow of theirs is worth a flight of yours. Had you  traded bow and arrows, you would have been called 'He shoots the sky.'  Now you shall be called 'Little Shooter.'\"    Little Shooter grew to be a man. He went often on the chase, but his  arrows did not bring much game.    Many times, he wished he could meet the little elf man again, and trade  bow and arrows, for sometimes he ran for days and found no track of deer  or rabbit. But the little elf man never came.    One day, when Little Shooter had grown to be quite an old man, he was  walking in the woods. He stopped under a tree to rest. Several times he  felt something fall on his head.    At last he looked up to see what it was.    There sat the little elf man, swinging on the tip of a branch, and  throwing nuts and twigs at him. He looked just as he did when Little  Shooter met him by the stream long before. He had not grown old or  changed at all.    \"How long have you been here?\" asked Little Shooter.    \"I have always been here,\" said the little man. \"I have been in the  world ever since the stones were soft.\"    Then he laughed, and asked, \"Does Little Shooter now like big bow and  arrows best, or has he learned that sometimes small things are great?  Next time, he had better trade with the little man,\" and aiming another  nut at Little Shooter's head, he disappeared in the tree trunk.    [Illustration]          HOW AN INDIAN BOY WON HIS NAME      It was bluebird time, many moons ago. Little brooks laughed and danced,  and all the forest was glad.    An Indian boy came running through the forest. He, too, was glad, for it  was spring!    As he ran down the trail, he saw something hanging from a bush. The bush  was but a few rabbit jumps from the trail, so he stopped to see what new  flower the spring had brought. He found the new flower to be a tiny  papoose cradle.    The boy picked the cradle from the bush, and held it in the palm of his  hand. As he looked closer, he saw that there was a tiny papoose in the  little cradle. The wee papoose laughed in his face, as he spoke to it.    The boy had never seen so tiny a papoose, and he thought he would take  it home to his mother, it was so cunning. She had but nine of her own.  He was sure she would like one more, and that there would be a place for  the tiny stranger in their wigwam.    He started to run on down the trail, but something seemed to hold him  fast. He could not get away. Three times he tried to run, but each time  he only circled round that bush. Something held him to the spot.    Just then there came a sharp cry from up the trail. The boy thought some  animal must be hurt or in pain. He turned to look and saw a little woman  coming. She was less than a foot high, but she ran like a deer to the  boy, and cried and begged him to give back her baby.    Then the boy knew it was the love of that little mother that had held  him fast. He could not break the love cord between that mother and her  baby.    Now the boy had a heart that was soft and kind. He liked to see  everything happy. When he saw the little mother crying and begging for  her baby, he felt sorry for her.    [Illustration]    Many times he had heard his mother tell how every mother bird loves her  young; every mother bear, her cub; every mother deer, her fawn; every  Indian mother, her papoose. And he knew this little fairy mother must  also love her fairy baby, so he put it on the little mother's back, and  told her she should have her papoose.    The little mother gave a glad cry, as she felt the baby on her back once  more. Then she drew a stone from a bag which she carried, and slipped it  on a string of beads that hung from the boy's neck.    The stone shone on his breast like a dewdrop.    \"Because you are good, and kind, and unselfish, and because you make  everything happy,\" she said, \"you shall wear this good-luck stone. It  will bring you whatever you want.    \"We Little People give this stone to those earth children only, who are  strong and yet protect the weak. Wear it always on your breast. Never  take it off, and you will become a mighty chief.\"    Then the little mother gave another glad cry, and with her baby on her  back she disappeared into an oak.    The boy ran on. His heart grew lighter and the stone brighter, as he  ran. Before he reached his mother's wigwam, his arrows had brought back  game for their evening meal.    From the day when the boy met the little _Jo gah oh_ mother in the wood,  and was given the stone, he had good luck. Whatever he did, all went  well with him. If he went on the chase, he brought back deer. If he  planted corn, it grew tall and fine. No boy could throw a ball as far,  or could run as fast as he. He could shoot his arrows to the sky, and  could send his snow-snakes skimming far beyond the rest.    So lucky was this Indian boy, that his tribe called him  \"Luck-in-all-moons.\" \"He wears the good-luck stone,\" the old people said  as they sat around the fire, and they nodded their heads knowingly. But  they never knew how he came by it, or why he won the stone.    And when \"Luck-in-all-moons\" grew to be a man, his tribe made him a  great chief. Just as the little _Jo gah oh_ mother had said, he became a  chief, though not in the chieftain line.    Because he stood so strong and straight, serving the people, protecting  the weak, and doing great deeds, he was called the Pine-tree Chief.    \"His feet are planted deep in wisdom and strength,\" they said, \"and his  head is not far from the sky. He sees far and points us the way. As the  topmost branch of the pine points always to the east, so  Luck-in-all-moons shall guide us to the sun rising. He shall be our  Pine-tree Chief.\"          HOW THE FAIRIES WORKED MAGIC"]]]
