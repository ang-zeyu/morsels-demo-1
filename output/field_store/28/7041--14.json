[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20847"],[0,"India: What can it teach us? (#14)"],[1," for those early poets and philosophers. They meant  to say \"the earth, such as we see it, is held up, that is, rests on  something real, though we may not see it, on something which they called  the Real,[67] and to which, in course of time, they gave many more  names, such as _R i_ t a, the right, B r a h m a n,\" etc.    Of course where there is that strong reverence for truth, there must  also be the sense of guilt arising from untruth. And thus we hear one  poet pray that the waters may wash him clean, and carry off all his  sins and all untruth:        \"Carry away, ye waters,[68] whatever evil there is in me,      wherever I may have deceived, or may have cursed, and also      all untruth (an_ri_tam).\"[69]    Or again, in the Atharva-Veda IV. 16:        \"May all thy fatal snares, which stand spread out seven by      seven and threefold, catch the man who tells a lie, may they      pass by him who tells the truth!\"    From the Brahma_n_as, or theological treatises of the Brahmans, I  shall quote a few passages only:        \"Whosoever[70] speaks the truth, makes the fire on his own      altar blaze up, as if he poured butter into the lighted fire.      His own light grows larger, and from to-morrow to to-morrow      he becomes better. But whosoever speaks untruth, he quenches      the fire on his altar, as if he poured water into the lighted      fire; his own light grows smaller and smaller, and from      to-morrow to to-morrow he becomes more wicked. Let man      therefore speak truth only.\"[71]    And again:[72] \"A man becomes impure by uttering falsehood.\"    And again:[73] \"As a man who steps on the edge of a sword placed over  a pit cries out, I shall slip, I shall slip into the pit, so let a man  guard himself from falsehood (or sin).\"    In later times we see the respect for truth carried to such an  extreme, that even a promise, unwittingly made, is considered to be  binding.    In the Ka_th_a-Upanishad, for instance, a father is introduced  offering what is called an _All_-sacrifice, where everything is  supposed to be given up. His son, who is standing by, taunts his  father with not having altogether fulfilled his vow, because he has  not sacrificed his son. Upon this, the father, though angry and  against his will, is obliged to sacrifice his son. Again, when the son  arrives in the lower world, he is allowed by the Judge of the Dead to  ask for three favors. He then asks to be restored to life, to be  taught some sacrificial mysteries, and, as the third boon, he asks to  know what becomes of man after he is dead. Yama, the lord of the  Departed, tries in vain to be let off from answering this last  question. But he, too, is bound by his promise, and then follows a  discourse on life after death, or immortal life, which forms one of  the most beautiful chapters in the ancient literature of India.    The whole plot of one of the great epic poems, the Ramaya_n_a, rests  on a rash promise given by Da_s_aratha, king of Ayodhya, to his second  wife, Kaikeyi, that he would grant her two boons. In order to secure  the succession to her own son, she asks that Rama, the eldest son by  the king's other wife, should be banished for fourteen years. Much as  the king repents his promise, Rama, his eldest son, would on no  account let his father break his word, and he leaves his kingdom to  wander in the forest with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshma_n_a.  After the father's death, the son of the second wife declines the  throne, and comes to Rama to persuade him to accept the kingdom of his  father. But all in vain. Rama will keep his exile for fourteen years,  and never disown his father's promise. Here follows a curious dialogue  between a Brahman _G_abali and Prince Rama, of which I shall give some  extracts:[74]        \"The Brahman, who is a priest and courtier, says, 'Well,      descendant of Raghu, do not thou, so noble in sentiments, and      austere in character, entertain, like a common man, this      useless thought. What man is a kinsman of any other? What      relationship has any one with another? A man is born alone      and dies alone. Hence he who is attached to any one as his      father or his mother, is to be regarded as if he were insane,      for no one belongs to another. Thou oughtest not to abandon      thy father's kingdom and stay here in a sad and miserable      abode, attended with many trials. Let thyself be inaugurated      king in the wealthy Ayodhya. Da_s_aratha, thy father is      nothing to thee, or thou to him; the king is one, and thou      another, do therefore what is said.... Then offer oblations      to the departed spirits (of thy forefathers) on prescribed      days; but see what a waste of food! For what can a dead man      eat? If what is eaten by one here enters into the body of      another (viz., of the departed), let _S_raddhas be offered to      those who are travelling; they need not then get food to eat      on their journey. These books (the Vedas), (which enjoin men      to) sacrifice, give, consecrate themselves, practise      austerities, and forsake the world, are composed by clever      men to induce others to bestow gifts. Authoritative words do      not fall from heaven. Let me, and others like yourselves,      embrace whatever assertion is supported by reason. Adhere to      what is apparent to the senses, and reject what is      invisible.... _This world is the next world_; do thou      therefore enjoy pleasure, for every virtuous man does not      gain it. Virtuous men are greatly distressed, while the      unrighteous are seen to be happy.'\"    These positivist sentiments sound strange, particularly from the mouth  of a Brahman. But the poet evidently wishes to represent a Brahman  living at court, who has an argument ready for anything and everything  that is likely to please his king.    But what does Rama answer? \"The words,\" he says, \"which you have  addressed to me, though they recommend what _seems_ to be right and  salutary, advise, in fact, the contrary. The sinful transgressor, who  lives according to the rules of heretical systems, obtains no esteem  from good men. It is good conduct that marks a man to be noble or  ignoble, heroic or a pretender to manliness, pure or impure. Truth and  mercy are immemorial characteristics of a king's conduct. Hence royal  rule is in its essence _truth_. On truth the word is based. Both sages  and gods have esteemed truth. The man who speaks truth in this world  attains the highest imperishable state. Men shrink with fear and  horror from a liar as from a serpent. In this world the chief element  in virtue is truth; it is called the basis of everything. Truth is  lord in the world; virtue always rests on truth. All things are  founded on truth; nothing is higher than it. Why, then, should I not  be true to my promise, and faithfully observe the truthful injunction  given by my father? Neither through covetousness, nor delusion, nor  ignorance, will I, overpowered by darkness, break through the barrier  of truth, but remain true to my promise to my father. How shall I,  having promised to him that I would thus reside in the forests,  transgress his injunction, and do what Bharata recommends?\"    The other epic poem too, the Mahabharata, is full of episodes showing  a profound regard for truth and an almost slavish submission to a  pledge once given. The death of Bhishma, one of the most important  events in the story of the Mahabharata, is due to his vow never to  hurt a woman. He is thus killed by _S_ikhandin, whom he takes to be a  woman.[75]    Were I to quote from all the law-books, and from still later works,  everywhere you would hear the same key-note of truthfulness vibrating  through them all.    We must not, however, suppress the fact that, under certain  circumstances, a lie was allowed, or, at all events, excused by Indian  lawgivers. Thus Gautama says:[76] \"An untruth spoken by people under  the influence of anger, excessive joy, fear, pain, or grief, by  infants, by very old men, by persons laboring under a delusion, being  under the influence of drink, or by madmen, does not cause the speaker  to fall, or, as we should say, is a venial, not a mortal sin.\"[77]    This is a large admission, yet even in that open admission there is a  certain amount of honesty. Again and again in the Mahabharata is this  excuse pleaded.[78] Nay, there is in the Mahabharata[79] the  well-known story of Kau_s_ika, called Satyavadin, the Truth-speaker,  who goes to hell for having spoken the truth. He once saw men flying  into the forest before robbers (dasyu). The robbers came up soon after  them, and asked Kau_s_ika, which way the fugitives had taken. He told  them the truth, and the men were caught by the robbers and killed.  But Kau_s_ika, we are told, went to hell for having spoken the truth.    The Hindus may seem to have been a priest-ridden race, and their  devotion to sacrifice and ceremonial is well known. Yet this is what  the poet of the Mahabharata dares to say:        \"Let a thousand sacrifices (of a horse) and truth be weighed      in the balance--truth will exceed the thousand      sacrifices.\"[80]    These are words addressed by _S_akuntala, the deserted wife, to King  Dushyanta, when he declined to recognize her and his son. And when he  refuses to listen to her appeal, what does she appeal to as the  highest authority?--_The voice of conscience._    \"If you think I am alone,\" she says to the king, \"you do not know that  wise man within your heart. He knows of your evil deed--in _his_ sight  you commit sin. A man who has committed sin may think that no one  knows it. The gods know it and the old man within.\"[81]    This must suffice. I say once more that I do not wish to represent the  people of India as two hundred and fifty-three millions of angels, but  I do wish it to be understood and to be accepted as a fact, that the  damaging charge of untruthfulness brought against that people is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#14)"],[1,"be read, \"Mercuric oxide when heated gives  mercury and oxygen\"; equation (2) is equivalent to the statement, \"When  electrolyzed, water produces hydrogen and oxygen\"; equation (3), \"When  heated together iron and sulphur unite to form iron sulphide\"; equation  (4), \"Potassium chlorate when heated yields potassium chloride and  oxygen.\"    ~Knowledge required for writing equations.~ In order to write such  equations correctly, a considerable amount of exact knowledge is  required. Thus, in equation (1) the fact that red oxide of mercury has  the composition represented by the formula HgO, that it is decomposed by  heat, that in this decomposition mercury and oxygen are formed and no  other products,--all these facts must be ascertained by exact experiment  before the equation can be written. An equation expressing these facts  will then have much value.    Having obtained an equation describing the conduct of mercuric oxide on  being heated, it will not do to assume that other oxides will behave in  like manner. Iron oxide (FeO) resembles mercuric oxide in many respects,  but it undergoes no change at all when heated. Manganese dioxide, the  black substance used in the preparation of oxygen, has the formula  MnO_{2}. When this substance is heated oxygen is set free, but the metal  manganese is not liberated; instead, a different oxide of manganese  containing less oxygen is produced. The equation representing the  reaction is        3MnO_{2} = Mn_{3}O_{4} + 2O.    ~Classes of reactions.~ When a chemical change takes place in a substance  the substance is said to undergo a reaction. Although a great many  different reactions will be met in the study of chemistry, they may all  be grouped under the following heads.    1. _Addition._ This is the simplest kind of chemical action. It consists  in the union of two or more substances to produce a new substance. The  combination of iron with sulphur is an example:        Fe + S = FeS.    2. _Decomposition._ This is the reverse of addition, the substance  undergoing reaction being parted into its constituents. The  decomposition of mercuric oxide is an example: HgO = Hg + O.    3. _Substitution._ It is sometimes possible for an element in the free  state to act upon a compound in such a way that it takes the place of  one of the elements of the compound, liberating it in turn. In the study  of the element hydrogen it was pointed out that hydrogen is most  conveniently prepared by the action of sulphuric or hydrochloric acid  upon zinc. When sulphuric acid is used a substance called zinc sulphate,  having the composition represented by the formula ZnSO_{4}, is formed  together with hydrogen. The equation is        Zn + H_{2}SO_{4} = ZnSO_{4} + 2H.    When hydrochloric acid is used zinc chloride and hydrogen are the  products of reaction:        Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl_{2} + 2H.    When iron is used in place of zinc the equation is        Fe + H_{2}SO_{4} = FeSO_{4} + 2H.    These reactions are quite similar, as is apparent from an examination of  the equations. In each case 1 atom of the metal replaces 2 atoms of  hydrogen in the acid, and the hydrogen escapes as a gas. When an element  in the free state, such as the zinc in the equations just given, takes  the place of some one element in a compound, setting it free from  chemical combination, the act is called _substitution_.    Other reactions illustrating substitution are the action of sodium on  water,        Na + H_{2}O = NaOH + H;    and the action of heated iron upon water,        3Fe + 4H_{2}O = Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H.    4. _Double decomposition._ When barium dioxide (BaO_{2}) is treated with  sulphuric acid two compounds are formed, namely, hydrogen dioxide  (H_{2}O_{2}) and barium sulphate (BaSO_{4}). The equation is        BaO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = BaSO_{4} + H_{2}O_{2}.    In this reaction it will be seen that the two elements barium and  hydrogen simply exchange places. Such a reaction is called a _double  decomposition_. We shall meet with many examples of this kind of  chemical reactions.    ~Chemical equations are quantitative.~ The use of symbols and formulas in  expressing chemical changes has another great advantage. Thus, according  to the equation        H_{2}O = 2H + O,    1 molecule of water is decomposed into 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of  oxygen. But, as we have seen, the relative weights of the atoms are  known, that of hydrogen being 1.008, while that of oxygen is 16. The  molecule of water, being composed of 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of  oxygen, must therefore weigh relatively 2.016 + 16, or 18.016. The  amount of hydrogen in this molecule must be 2.016/18.016, or 11.18% of  the whole, while the amount of oxygen must be 16/18.018, or 88.82% of  the whole. Now, since any definite quantity of water is simply the sum  of a great many molecules of water, it is plain that the fractions  representing the relative amounts of hydrogen and oxygen present in a  molecule must likewise express the relative amounts of hydrogen and  oxygen present in any quantity of water. Thus, for example, in 20 g. of  water there are 2.016/18.016 x 20, or 2.238 g. of hydrogen, and  16/18.016 x 20, or 17.762 g. of oxygen. These results in reference to  the composition of water of course agree exactly with the facts obtained  by the experiments described in the chapter on water, for it is because  of those experiments that the values 1.008 and 16 are given to hydrogen  and oxygen respectively.    It is often easier to make calculations of this kind in the form of a  proportion rather than by fractions. Since the molecule of water and  the two atoms of hydrogen which it contains have the ratio by weight of  18.016: 2.016, any mass of water has the same ratio between its total  weight and the weight of the hydrogen in it. Hence, to find the number  of grams (x) of hydrogen in 20 g. of water, we have the proportion        18.016 : 2.016 :: 20 g. : x (grams of hydrogen).    Solving for x, we get 2.238 for the number of grams of hydrogen.  Similarly, to find the amount (x) of oxygen present in the 20 g. of  water, we have the proportion        18.016 : 16 :: 20 : x    from which we find that x = 17.762 g.    Again, suppose we wish to find what weight of oxygen can be obtained  from 15 g. of mercuric oxide. The equation representing the  decomposition of mercuric oxide is        HgO = Hg + O.    The relative weights of the mercury and oxygen atoms are respectively  200 and 16. The relative weight of the mercuric oxide molecule must  therefore be the sum of these, or 216. The molecule of mercuric oxide  and the atom of oxygen which it contains have the ratio 216: 16. This  same ratio must therefore hold between the weight of any given quantity  of mercuric oxide and that of the oxygen which it contains. Hence, to  find the weight of oxygen in 15 g. of mercuric oxide, we have the  proportion        216 : 16 :: 15 : x (grams of oxygen).    On the other hand, suppose we wish to prepare, say, 20 g. of oxygen. The  problem is to find out what weight of mercuric oxide will yield 20 g. of  oxygen. The following proportion evidently holds        216 : 16 :: x (grams of mercuric oxide) : 20;    from which we get x = 270.    In the preparation of hydrogen by the action of sulphuric acid upon  zinc, according to the equation,        Zn + H_{2}SO_{4} = ZnSO_{4} + 2 H,    suppose that 50 g. of zinc are available; let it be required to  calculate the weight of hydrogen which can be obtained. It will be seen  that 1 atom of zinc will liberate 2 atoms of hydrogen. The ratio by  weight of a zinc to an hydrogen atom is 65.4: 1.008; of 1 zinc atom to 2  hydrogen atoms, 65.4: 2.016. Zinc and hydrogen will be related in this  reaction in this same ratio, however many atoms of zinc are concerned.  Consequently in the proportion        65.4 : 2.016 :: 50 : x,    x will be the weight of hydrogen set free by 50 g. of zinc. The weight  of zinc sulphate produced at the same time can be found from the  proportion        65.4 : 161.46 :: 50 : x;    where 161.46 is the molecular weight of the zinc sulphate, and x the  weight of zinc sulphate formed. In like manner, the weight of sulphuric  acid used up can be calculated from the proportion        65.4 : 98.076 :: 50 : x.    These simple calculations are possible because the symbols and formulas  in the equations represent the relative weights of the substances  concerned in a chemical reaction. When once the relative weights of the  atoms have been determined, and it has been agreed to allow the symbols  to stand for these relative weights, an equation or formula making use  of the symbols becomes a statement of a definite numerical fact, and  calculations can be based on it.    ~Chemical equations not algebraic.~ Although chemical equations are  quantitative, it must be clearly understood that they are not algebraic.  A glance at the equations        7 + 4 = 11, 8 + 5 = 9 + 4    will show at once that they are true. The equations        HgO = Hg + O, FeO = Fe + O    are equally true in an algebraic sense, but experiment shows that only  the first is true chemically, for iron oxide (FeO) cannot be directly  decomposed into iron and oxygen. Only such equations as have been found  by careful experiment to express a real chemical transformation, true  both for the kinds of substances as well as for the weights, have any  value.    _Chemical formulas and equations, therefore, are a concise way of  representing qualitatively and quantitatively facts which have been  found by experiment to be true in reference to the composition of  substances and the changes which they undergo._    ~Formulas representing water of crystallization.~ An examination of  substances containing water of crystallization has shown that in every  case the water is present in such proportion by weight as can readily be  represented by a formula. For example, copper sulphate (CuSO_{4}) and  water combine in the ratio of 1 molecule of the"]]]
