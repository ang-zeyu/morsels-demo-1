Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton (Lord Lytton) published six of the _Lost Tales  of Mil[=e]tus_ in rhymeless verse. He pretends he borrowed them from the  scattered remnants preserved by Apollodo'rus and Conon, contained in the  pages of Pausa'nias and Athenaeus, or dispersed throughout the  Scholiasts. The Milesian tales were, for the most part, in prose; but  Ovid tells us that Aristi'd[^e]s rendered some of them into verse, and  Sisenna into Latin.        Junxit Aristides Milesia carmina secum      Pulsus Aristides nec tamen urba sua est.    The original tales by Antonius Diog'en[^e]s are described by Photius. It  appears that they were great favorites with the luxurious Sybarites. A  compilation was made by Arist[=i]d[^e]s, by whom (according to Ovid)  some were versified also. The Latin translation by Sisenna was made  about the time of the civil wars of Ma'rius and Sylla. Parthen'ius  Nice'nus, who taught Virgil Greek, borrowed thirty-six of the tales,  which he dedicated to Cornelius Gallus, and entitled _Er[^o]tik[^o]n  Path[^e]mat[^o]n_ (\"love stories\").    _Milesia Crimina_, amatory offences. Venus was worshipped at Mil[=e]tus,  and hence the loose amatory tales of Antonius Diogen[^e]s were entitled  _Milesiae Fabulae_.      =Mile'sians=, the \"ancient\" Irish. The legend is that Ireland was once  peopled by the Fir-bolg or Belgae from Britain, who were subdued by  Milesians from Asia Minor, called the Gaels of Ireland.      =Miles= (_Throckmorton_), harum-scarum, brave, indiscreet, over-generous  hero of Constance Cary Harrison's story, _Flower de Hundred_ (1890).      =Milford= (_Colonel_), a friend of Sir Geoffrey Peveril.--Sir W. Scott,  _Peveril of the Peak_ (time, Charles II.).    _Milford_ (_Jack_), a natural son of Widow Warren's late husband. He was  the crony of Harry Dornton, with whom he ran \"the road to ruin.\" Jack  had a fortune left him, but he soon scattered it by his extravagant  living, and was imprisoned for debt. Harry then promised to marry Widow  Warren if she would advance him [pounds]6,000 to pay off his friend's  debts with. When Harry's father heard of this bargain, he was so moved  that he advanced the money himself; and Harry, being set free from his  bargain, married the widow's daughter instead of the widow. Thus all  were rescued from \"the road to ruin.\"--Holcroft, _The Road to Ruin_  (1792).      =Milinowski=, a portly, imposing American widow, who, after twenty years  spent under the marital rule of a Prussian army officer, \"takes kindly  to the prose of life.\" She is the exemplary and not unkindly chaperone  of _Miss Caroline Lester_, heroine of Charlotte Dunning's book _Upon a  Cast_ (1885).      =Milk-Pail= (_The_), which was to gain a fortune, (See PERRETTE.)      =Millamant=, the _pr['e]tendue_ of Edward Mirabell. She is a most  brilliant girl, who says she \"loves to give pain, because cruelty is a  proof of power; and when one parts with one's cruelty, one parts with  one's power.\" Millamant is far gone in poetry, and her heart is not in  her own keeping. Sir Wilful Witwould makes love to her, but she detests  \"the superannuated lubber.\"--W. Congreve, _The Way of the World_ (1700).      =Miller= (_James_), the \"tiger\" of the Hon. Mr. Flammer.

Selby, _The Unfinished Gentleman_.    _Miller_, (_Joe_), James Ballantyne, author of _Old Joe Miller, by the  Editor of New J. M._, three vols. (1801).    [Asterism] Mottley compiled a jest-book in the reign of James II.,  entitled _Joe Miller's Jests_. The phrase, \"That's a Joe Miller,\" means  \"that's a jest from Mottley's book.\"    _Miller_ (_Maximilian Christopher_), the Saxon giant; height eight feet.  His hand measured a foot; his second finger was nine inches long; his  head unusually large. He wore a rich Hungarian jacket and a huge plumed  cap. This giant was exhibited in London in the year 1733. He died aged  60; was born at Leipsic (1674-1734).      =Miller= (_Draxy_), bonny daughter of a thriftless, honest man, whose  energy in the effort to recover some hundreds of acres of woodland  deeded to her in jest, and supposed to be unprofitable, leads to comfort  for her father, and a happy marriage for herself.--_Saxe Holm Stories_  (1886).      =Miller of Mansfield= (_The_), John Cockle, a miller and keeper of  Sherwood Forest. Hearing the report of a gun, John Cockle went into the  forest at night to find poachers, and came upon the king (Henry VIII.),  who had been hunting, and had got separated from his courtiers. The  miller collared him; but, being told he was a wayfarer, who had lost  himself in the forest, he took him home with him for the night. Next  day, the courtiers were brought to the same house, having been seized as  poachers by the under-keepers. It was then discovered that the miller's  guest was the king, who knighted the miller, and settled on him 1000  marks a year.--R. Dodsley, _The King and the Miller of Mansfield_  (1737).      =Miller of Trompington= (_The_), Simon Simkin, an arrant thief. Two  scholars undertook to see that a sack of corn was ground for \"Solar Hill  College,\" without being tampered with; so one stood at the hopper, and  the other at the trough below. In the mean time, Simon Simkin let loose  the scholars' horse; and while they went to catch it, he purloined half  a bushel of the flour, which was made into cakes, and substituted meal  in its stead. But the young men had their revenge; they not only made  off with the flour, meal, and cakes without payment, but left the miller  well trounced also.--Chaucer, _Canterbury Tales_ (\"The Reeve's Tale,\"  1388).         A trick something like that played off on the Miller of       Trompington.--_Review of Kirkton_, xix. 253.      =Miller on the Dee.= \"There was a Jolly Miller once lived on the River  Dee,\" is a song by Isaac Bickerstaff, introduced in _Love in a Village_,  i. 1 (1763).      =Mills= (_Miss_), the bosom friend of Dora. Supposed to have been blighted  in early life in some love affair, and hence she looks on the happiness  of others with a calm, supercilious benignity, and talks of herself as  being \"in the desert of Sahara.\"--C. Dickens, _David Copperfield_  (1849).      =Millwood= (_Sarah_), the courtezan who enticed George Barnwell to rob his  master and murder his uncle.

Both were hanged.--George Lillo, _George  Barnwell_ (1732).      =Milly=, the wife of William Swidger. She is the good angel of the  tale.--C. Dickens, _The Haunted Man_ (1848).      =Milo=, an athlete of Croto'na, noted for his amazing strength. He could  carry on his shoulders a four-year-old heifer. When old, Milo attempted  to tear in twain an oak tree, but the parts, closing on his hands, held  him fast, till he was devoured by wolves.    _Milo_ (_The English_), Thomas Topham, of London (1710-1752).      =Milton=, introduced by Sir Walter Scott in _Woodstock_ (time,  Commonwealth).      =Milton of Germany=, Frederick Gottlieb Klopstock, author of _The  Messiah_, an epic poem (1724-1803).        A very German Milton indeed.        Coleridge.      =Milton's Monument=, in Westminster Abbey, was by Rysbrack.      =Milvey= (_The Rev. Frank_), a \"young man expensively educated and  wretchedly paid, with quite a young wife and half a dozen young  children. He was under the necessity of teaching ... to eke out his  scanty means, yet was generally expected to have more time to spare than  the idlest person in the parish, and more money than the richest.\"    _Mrs. Milvey_ (_Margaretta_), a pretty, bright little woman, emphatic  and impulsive, but \"something worn by anxiety. She had repressed many  pretty tastes and bright fancies, and substituted instead schools, soup,  flannel, coals, and all the week-day cares and Sunday coughs of a large  population, young and old.\"--C. Dickens, _Our Mutual Friend_ (1864).      =Minagro'bis=, admiral of the cats in the great sea-fight of the cats and  rats. Minagrobis won the victory by devouring the admiral of the rats,  who had made three voyages round the world in very excellent ships, in  which he was neither one of the officers nor one of the crew, but a kind  of interloper.--Comtesse D'Aulnoy, _Fairy Tales_ (\"The White Cat,\"  1682).      =Min'cing=, lady's-maid to Millamant. She says _mem_ for ma'am, _fit_ for  fought, _la'ship_ for ladyship, etc.--W. Congreve, _The Way of the  World_ (1700).      =Minikin= (_Lord_), married to a cousin of Sir John Trotley, but,  according to _bon ton_, he flirts with Miss Tittup; and Miss Tittup, who  is engaged to Colonel Tivy, flirts with a married man.    _Lady Minikin_, wife of Lord Minikin. According to _bon ton_, she hates  her husband, and flirts with Colonel Tivy; and Colonel Tivy, who is  engaged to Miss Tittup, flirts with a married woman. It is _bon ton_ to  do so.--Garrick, _Bon Ton_ (1760).      =Minjekah'wun=, Hiawatha's mittens, made of deer-skin. When Hiawatha had  his mittens on, he could smite the hardest rocks asunder.        He [_Hiawatha_] had mittens, Minjekahwun,      Magic mittens made of deer-skin;      When upon his hands he wore them,      He could smite the rocks asunder.        Longfellow, _Hiawatha_, iv. (1855).      =Minna and Brenda=, two beautiful girls, the daughters of Magnus Troil,  the old udaller of Zetland. Minna was stately in form, with dark eyes  and raven locks; credulous and vain, but not giddy; enthusiastic,  talented and warm-hearted. She loved Captain Clement Cleveland; but  Cleveland was killed in an encounter on the Spanish main. Brenda had  golden hair, a bloom on her cheeks, a fairy form, and a serene, cheerful  disposition.

The Merry Little Breezes watched him for a few minutes and then raced  over to the Laughing Brook.  There they found Billy Mink stealing  softly down towards the Smiling Pool.    \"Oh, Billy Mink, come play with us,\" begged the Merry Little Breezes.    \"Can't,\" said Billy Mink.  \"I have to catch a trout for Grandfather  Mink's breakfast,\" and he crept on towards the Smiling Pool.    Just then along came Bumble the Bee.  Now Bumble the Bee is a lazy  fellow who always makes a great fuss, as if he was the busiest and most  important fellow in the world.    \"Good morning, Bumble,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes.  \"Come play  with us!\"    \"Buzz, buzz, buzz,\" grumbled Bumble the Bee.  \"Can't, for I have to get  a sack of honey,\" and off he hurried to the nearest dandelion.    Then the Merry Little Breezes hunted up Johnny Chuck.  But Johnny Chuck  was busy, too busy to play.  Bobby Coon was asleep, for he had been out  all night.  Reddy Fox also was asleep.  Striped Chipmunk was in such a  hurry to fill the pockets in his cheeks that he could hardly stop to  say good morning.  Happy Jack Squirrel just flirted his big tail and  rushed away as if he had many important things to attend to.    Finally the Merry Little Breezes gave it up and sat down among the  buttercups and daisies to talk it over.  Every one seemed to have  something to do, every one but themselves.  It was such a busy world  that sunshiny morning!  Pretty soon one of the Merry Little Breezes  hopped up very suddenly and began the maddest little dance among the  buttercups.    \"As we haven't anything to do for ourselves let's do something for  somebody else!\" he shouted.    Up jumped all the Little Breezes, clapping their hands.    \"Oh let's!\" they shouted.    Way over across the Green Meadows they could see two long ears above  the nodding daisies.    \"There's Peter Rabbit,\" cried one.  \"Let's help him find those tender  young carrots!\"    No sooner proposed than off they all raced to see who could reach Peter  first.  Peter was sitting up very straight, looking this way and  looking that way for some tender young carrots, but not one had he  found, and his stomach was empty.  The Merry Little Breezes stopped  just long enough to tickle his long ears and pull his whiskers, then  away they raced, scattering in all directions, to see who could first  find a tender young carrot for Peter Rabbit.  By and by when one of  them did find a field of tender young carrots he rushed off, taking the  smell of them with him to tickle the nose of Peter Rabbit.    Peter wriggled his nose, his funny little nose, very fast when it was  tickled with the smell of tender young carrots, and the Merry Little  Breeze laughed to see him.    \"Come on, Peter Rabbit, for this is my busy day!\" he cried.    Peter Rabbit didn't have to be invited twice.  Away he went,  lipperty-lipperty-lip, as fast as his long legs could take him after  the Merry Little Breeze.  And presently they came to the field of  tender young carrots.    \"Oh thank you, Merry Little Breeze!\" cried Peter Rabbit, and  straightway began to eat his breakfast.    Another Merry Little Breeze, slipping up the Crooked Little Path on the  hill, spied the hind legs of a fat beetle sticking out from under a  flat stone.  At once the Little Breeze remembered Jimmy Skunk, who was  hunting for beetles for his breakfast.  Off rushed the Little Breeze in  merry whirls that made the grasses sway and bend and the daisies nod.    When after a long, long hunt he found Jimmy Skunk, Jimmy was very much  out of sorts.  In fact Jimmy Skunk was positively cross.  You see, he  hadn't had any breakfast, for hunt as he would he couldn't find a  single beetle.    When the Merry Little Breeze danced up behind Jimmy Skunk and, just in  fun, rumpled up his black and white coat, Jimmy quite lost his temper.  In fact he said some things not at all nice to the Merry Little Breeze.  But the Merry Little Breeze just laughed.  The more he laughed the  crosser Jimmy Skunk grew, and the crosser Jimmy Skunk grew the more the  Merry Little Breeze laughed.  It was such a jolly laugh that pretty  soon Jimmy Skunk began to grin a little sheepishly, then to really  smile and finally to laugh outright in spite of his empty stomach.  You  see it is very hard, very hard indeed and very foolish, to remain cross  when someone else is perfectly good natured.    Suddenly the Merry Little Breeze danced up to Jimmy Skunk and whispered  in his right ear.  Then he danced around and whispered in his left ear.  Jimmy Skunk's eyes snapped and his mouth began to water.    \"Where, Little Breeze, where?\" he begged.    \"Follow me,\" cried the Merry Little Breeze, racing off up the Crooked  Little Path so fast that Jimmy Skunk lost his breath trying to keep up,  for you know Jimmy Skunk seldom hurries.    When they came to the big flat stone Jimmy Skunk grasped it with both  hands and pulled and pulled.  Up came the stone so suddenly that Jimmy  Skunk fell over flat on his back.  When he had scrambled to his feet  there were beetles and beetles, running in every direction to find a  place to hide.    \"Thank you, thank you, Little Breeze,\" shouted Jimmy Skunk as he  started to catch beetles for his breakfast.    And the Little Breeze laughed happily as he danced away to join the  other Merry Little Breezes on the Green Meadows.  There he found them  very, very busy, very busy indeed, so busy that they could hardly find  time to nod to him.  What do you think they were doing?  They were  toting _gold_!  Yes, Sir, toting gold!  And this is how it happened:    While the first Little Breeze was showing Peter Rabbit the field of  tender young carrots, and while the second Little Breeze was leading  Jimmy Skunk to the flat stone and the beetles, the other Merry Little  Breezes had found Bumble the Bee.  Now Bumble the Bee is a lazy fellow,  though he pretends to be the busiest fellow in the world, and they  found him grumbling as he buzzed with a great deal of fuss from one  flower to another.    \"What's the matter, Bumble?\" cried the Merry Little Breezes.    \"Matter enough,\" grumbled Bumble the Bee.  \"I've got to make a sack of  honey, and as if that isn't enough, old Mother Nature has ordered me to  carry a sack of gold from each flower I visit to the next flower I  visit.  If I don't I can get no honey.  Buzz-buzz-buzz,\" grumbled  Bumble the Bee.    The Merry Little Breezes looked at the million little flowers on the  Green Meadows, each waiting a sack of gold to give and a sack of gold  to receive.  Then they looked at each other and shouted happily, for  they too would now be able to cry \"busy, busy, busy.\"    From flower to flower they hurried, each with a bag of gold over his  shoulder.  Wherever they left a bag they took a bag, and all the little  flowers nodded happily to see the Merry Little Breezes at work.    Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and higher and higher in the  blue sky, where he can look down and see all things, great and small.  His smile was broader than ever as he watched the hurrying, scurrying  Little Breezes working instead of playing.  Yet after all it was a kind  of play, for they danced from flower to flower and ran races across  bare places where no flowers grew.    By and by the Merry Little Breezes met Peter Rabbit.  Now Peter Rabbit  had made a good breakfast of tender young carrots, so he felt very  good, very good indeed.    \"Hi!\" shouted Peter Rabbit, \"come play with me.\"    \"Can't,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes all together, \"we have work to  do!\"    Off they hurried, while Peter Rabbit stretched himself out full length  in a sunny spot, for Peter Rabbit also is a lazy fellow.    Down the Crooked Little Path onto the Green Meadows came Jimmy Skunk.    \"Ho!\" shouted Jimmy Skunk as soon as he saw the Little Breezes, \"come  play with me.\"    \"Can't,\" cried the Little Breezes, \"for we are busy, busy, busy,\" and  they laughed happily.    When they reached the Laughing Brook they found Billy Mink curled up in  a round ball, fast asleep.  It isn't often that Billy Mink is caught  napping, but he had had a good breakfast of trout, he had found no one  to play with and, as he never works and the day was so bright and warm,  he had first looked for a place where he thought no one would find him  and had then curled himself up to sleep, One of the Little Breezes laid  down the bag of gold he was carrying and creeping ever so softly over  to Billy Mink began to tickle one of Billy's ears with a straw.    At first Billy Mink didn't open his eyes, but rubbed his ear with a  little black hand.  Finally he jumped to his feet wide awake and ready  to fight whoever was bothering him.  But all he saw was a laughing  Little Breeze running away with a bag of gold on his back.    So all day long, till Old Mother West Wind came with her big bag to  carry them to their home behind the Purple Hills, the Merry Little  Breezes hurried this way and that way over the Green Meadows.  No wee  flower was too tiny to give and receive its share of gold, and not one  was overlooked by the Merry Little Breezes.    Old Mother Nature, who knows everything, heard of the busy day of the  Merry Little Breezes.  Nobody knows how she heard of it.  Perhaps  jolly, round, red Mr. Sun told her.  Perhaps--but never mind.  You  can't fool old Mother Nature anyway and it's of no use to try.    So old Mother Nature visited the Green Meadows to see for herself, and  when she found how the Merry Little Breezes had distributed the gold  she was so pleased that straightway she announced to all the world that  thenceforth and for all time the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother  West Wind should have charge of the distribution of the gold of the  flowers on the Green Meadows, which they have to this day.    And since that day"]]]
