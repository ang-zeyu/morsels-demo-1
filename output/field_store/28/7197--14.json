The  country was superb; on all sides were to be seen fine fat sheep,  great oxen, white as snow, with short strong horns, and thousands of  domestic fowls and other birds; also there were magnificent date,  orange, and pistachio trees.    After travelling for five days they entered the beautiful and well  watered plain of Cormos or Ormuz, and after two days' further march  they reached the shores of the Persian Gulf and the town of Ormuz,  which forms the sea-port of the kingdom of Kirman. This country they  found very warm und unhealthy, but rich in date and spice trees, in  grain, precious stones, silk and golden stuffs, and elephants' tusks,  wine made from the date and other merchandise being brought into the  town ready for shipment on board ships with but one mast, which came  in numbers to the port; but many were lost on the voyage to India,  as they were only built with wooden pegs, not iron nails, to fasten  them together.    From Ormuz, Marco Polo, going up again towards the north-east,  visited Kirman; then he ventured by dangerous roads across a sandy  desert, where there was only brackish water to be found, the desert  across which, 1500 years before, Alexander had led his army to meet  Nearchus. Seven days afterwards he entered the town of Khabis. On  leaving this town he crossed for eight days the great plains to  Tonokan, the capital of the province of Kumis, probably Damaghan. At  this point of his narrative Marco Polo gives an account of the \"Old  Man of the Mountain,\" the chief of the Mahometan sect called the  Hashishins, who were noted for their religious fanaticism and  terrible cruelty. He next visited the Khorassan town of Cheburgan, a  city celebrated for its sweet melons, and then the noble city of  Balkh, situated near the source of the Oxus. Next he crossed a  country infested by lions to Taikan, a great salt-market frequented  by a large number of merchants, and to Scasem; this town seems to be  the Kashme spoken of by Marsden, the Kishin or Krishin of  Hiouen-Tsang, which Sir Henry Rawlinson has identified with the hill  of Kharesm of Zend-Avesta, that some commentators think must be the  modern Koundouz. In this part of the country he says porcupines  abound, and when they are hunted they curl themselves up, darting  out the prickles on their sides and backs at the dogs that are  hunting them. We now know how much faith to put in this pretended  power of defence said to be possessed by the porcupine.    Marco Polo now entered the rocky mountainous kingdom of the Balkhs,  whose kings claim descent from Alexander the Great; a cold country,  producing good fast horses, excellent falcons, and all kinds of game.  Here, too, are prolific ruby-mines worked by the king and which  yield large quantities, but they are so strictly enclosed that no  one on pain of death may set foot on the Sighinan mountain  containing the mines. In other places silver is found, and many  precious stones, of which he says \"they make the finest azure in the  world,\" meaning lapis-lazuli; his stay in this part of the country  must have been a long one to have enabled him to observe so many of  its characteristics. Ten days' journey from hence he entered a  province which must be the Peshawur of the present day, whose  dark-skinned inhabitants were idolaters; then after seven days'  further march, about mid-day he came to the kingdom of Cashmere,  where the temperature is cool, and towns and villages are very  numerous. Had Marco Polo continued his route in the same direction  he would soon have reached the territory of India, but instead of  that he took a northerly course, and in twelve days was in Vaccan, a  land watered by the Upper Oxus, which runs through splendid pastures,  where feed immense flocks of wild sheep, called mufflons. Thence he  went through a mountainous country, lying between the Altai and  Himalayan ranges to Kashgar. Here Marco Polo's route is the same as  that of his uncle and his father during their first voyage, when  from Bokhara they were taken to the residence of the great khan.  From Kashgar, Marco Polo diverged a little to the west, to Samarcand,  a large town inhabited by Saracens and Christians, then to Yarkand,  a city frequented by caravans trading between India and Northern  Asia; passing by Khotan, the capital of the province of that name,  and by Pein, a town whose situation is uncertain, but in a part of  the country where chalcedony and jasper abound. He came to the  kingdom of Kharachar, which extends along the borders of the desert  of Jobe; then after five days' further travelling over sandy plains,  where there was no water fit to drink, he rested for eight days in  the city of Lob, a place now in ruins, while he prepared to cross  the desert lying to the east, \"so great a desert,\" he says, \"that it  would require a year to traverse its whole length, a haunted  wilderness, where drums and other instruments are heard, though  invisible.\"    After spending a year crossing this desert, Marco Polo reached  Tcha-tcheou, in the province of Tangaut, a town built on the western  limits of the Chinese empire. There are but few merchants here, the  greater part of the population being agricultural. The custom that  seems to have struck him the most in the province of Tangaut, was  that of burning their dead only on a day fixed by the astrologers;  \"all the time that the dead remain in their houses, the relations  stay there with them, preparing a place at each meal as well as  providing both food and drink for the corpse, as though it were  still alive.\"    Marco Polo and his companions made an excursion to the north-east,  to the city of Amil, going on as far as Ginchintalas, a town  inhabited by idolaters, Mahometans, and Nestorian Christians, whose  situation is disputed. From this town Marco Polo returned to  Tcha-tcheou, and went eastward across Tangaut, by the town of So-ceu,  over a tract of country particularly favourable to the cultivation  of rhubarb, and by Kanpiceon, the Khan-tcheou of the Chinese, then  the capital of the province of Tangaut, an important town, whose  numerous chiefs are idolaters and polygamists. The three Venetians  remained a year in this large city; it is easy to understand, from  their long halts and deviations, why they required three years for  their journey across Central Asia.    They left Khan-tcheou, and after riding for twelve days they reached  the borders of a sandy desert, and entered the city of Etzina. This  was another detour, as it lay directly north of their route, but  they wished to visit Kara-Korum, the celebrated capital of Tartary,  where Rubruquis had been in 1254. Marco Polo was certainly an  explorer by nature; fatigue was nothing to him if he had any  geographical studies to complete, which is proved by his spending  forty days crossing an uninhabited desert without vegetation, in  order to reach the Tartar town.    When he arrived there, he found a city measuring three miles in  circumference, which had been for a long time the capital of the  Empire, before it was conquered by Gengis-Khan, the grandfather of  the reigning emperor. Here Marco Polo makes an historical digression,  in which he gives an account of the wars of the Tartar chiefs  against the famous Prester John who held all this part of the  country under his dominion.    Marco Polo after returning to Khan-tcheou left it again, marching  five days towards the east, and arriving at the town of Erginul.  Thence he went a little to the south to visit Sining-foo, across a  tract of country where grazed great wild oxen and the valuable  species of goat which is called the \"musk-bearer.\" Returning to  Erginul, they went eastward to Cialis, where there is the best  manufactory of cloth made from camels' hair in the world, to Tenduc,  a town in the province of the same name, where a descendant of  Prester John reigned, but who had given in his submission to the  great khan; this was a busy flourishing town: from hence the  travellers went to Sinda-tchou, and on beyond the great wall of  China as far as Ciagannor, which must be Tzin-balgassa, a pretty  town where the emperor lives when he wishes to hawk; for cranes,  storks, pheasants, and partridges abound in this neighbourhood.    At last Marco Polo, his father, and his uncle, reached Ciandu or  Tchan-tchou of the present day, called elsewhere in this narrative  Clemen-foo. Here Kublai-Khan received the papal envoys, for he was  occupying his summer palace beyond the great wall, north of Pekin,  which was then the capital of the empire. The traveller does not  tell us what reception he met with, but he describes most carefully  the palace, the grandeur of the building of stone and marble,  standing in the middle of a park surrounded by walls, enclosing  menageries and fountains. Also a building made of reeds, so closely  interlaced as to be impenetrable to water; it was a sort of movable  kiosk that the great khan inhabited during the fine months of June,  July, and August. The weather during the emperor's sojourn in this  summer palace could not but be beautiful, for, according to Marco  Polo, the astrologers who were attached to the khan's court were  charged to scatter all rain and fog by their sorcery, and the  travellers seem to believe in the power of these magicians. \"These  astrologers,\" he says, \"belong to two races, both idolaters; they  are learned in all magic and enchantments, above any other men, and  what they do is done by the aid of the devil, but they make others  believe that they owe their power to the help of God, and their own  holiness. These people have the following strange custom: when a man  has been condemned and put to death, they take the body, cook, and  eat it; but in the case of a natural death they do not eat the body.  And you must know that these people of whom I am speaking, who know  so many kinds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#14)"],[1,"address to the City of London.[31]        [Footnote 31: Declaring for the Repeal of the Corn Laws.]    The whole country cries out: the Corn Laws are doomed.    Thereon Sir Robert declared to his Cabinet that nothing but unanimity  could save the cause, and pressed for a decision.    The Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Stanley declared they could not take a  part in a measure abolishing the Corn Laws, and would therefore have  to resign. The other members, including the Duke of Wellington, showed  themselves ready to support Sir Robert, yet, as the latter says,  \"apparently not willingly and against their feelings.\" Thereupon Sir  Robert resolved to lay down his office as Minister.    When he arrived here he was visibly much moved, and said to me, that  it was one of the most painful moments of his life to separate himself  from us, \"but it is necessary, and if I have erred it was from loyalty  and too great an anxiety not to leave Her Majesty in a moment of such  great difficulty. I ought to have gone when I was first left by my  colleagues in a minority in my own Cabinet. I was anxious, however, to  try my utmost, but it is impossible to retrieve lost time. As soon as  I saw Lord John's letter I felt that the ground was slipping away  from under me, and that whatever I might now propose would appear as  dictated by the Opposition, as taking Lord John's measure. On the 1st  of November the whole country was prepared for the thing; there had  been no agitation, everybody looking to the Government, as soon as  they saw this wavering and hesitating, the country decided for itself,  and Lord John has the merit, owing to his most dexterous move and our  want of unanimity.\"    On my observing that Sir Robert has a majority of one hundred in the  House of Commons, and asking whether it was not possible for him to  continue the Government, he said:--    \"The Duke of Buccleuch will carry half Scotland with him, and Lord  Stanley, leading the Protectionists in the House of Lords, would lead  to great and immediate defections even in Her Majesty's household. The  Duchess of Buccleuch, Lord Hardwicke, Lord Exeter, Lord Rivers,  Lord Beverley, etc., would resign, and we should not be able to find  successors; in the House of Commons I am sure I should be beat, the  Tories, agriculturists, etc., in rage would turn round upon me and  be joined by the Whigs and Radicals, who would say, 'This is _our_  measure and we will not allow you to carry it.' It is better that  I should go now, when _nobody has committed himself_ in the heat  of party contest, when no factions have been formed, no imprudent  declarations been made; it is better for Her Majesty and for the  country that it should be so.\"    After we had examined what possibilities were open for the Crown, the  conclusion was come to that Lord John was the only man who could be  charged with forming a Cabinet. Lord Stanley, with the aristocracy as  his base, would bring about an insurrection [or riots], and the ground  on which one would have to fight would be this: to want to force the  mass of the people, amidst their great poverty, to pay for their bread  a high price, in favour of the landlords.    It is a matter of the utmost importance not to place the House of  Lords into direct antagonism with the Commons and with the masses of  the people. Sir Robert says very correctly:--    \"I am afraid of other interests getting damaged in the struggle about  the Corn Laws; already the system of promotion in the Army, the Game  Laws, the Church, are getting attacked with the aid of the league.\"    After Victoria had in consequence [of the foregoing] decided in favour  of Lord John, and asked Sir Robert: \"But how is it possible for him  to govern with so exceedingly small a minority?\" Sir Robert said: \"He  will have difficulties and perhaps did not consider what he was doing  when he wrote that letter; but _I will support him_. I feel it my duty  to your Majesty not to leave you without a Government. Even if Lord  John goes to the full extent of his declaration in that letter (which  I think goes too far), I will support him in Parliament and use all  my influence with the House of Lords to prevent their impeding his  progress. I will do more, if he likes it. I will say that the increase  of the estimates which will become necessary are my work, and I alone  am responsible for it.\"    Sir Robert intends to give me a memorandum in which he is to make this  promise in writing.    He was greatly moved, and said it was not \"the loss of power (for I  hate power) nor of office,\" which was nothing but a plague for him,  but \"the breaking up of those relations in which he stood to the Queen  and me, and the loss of our society,\" which was for him a loss, for  which there was no equivalent; we might, however, rely on his being  always ready to serve us, in what manner and in what place it might  be. Lord Aberdeen is said to feel the same, and very deeply so; and on  our side the loss of two so estimable men, who possess our whole and  perfect confidence in public as well as in private affairs, and have  always proved themselves true friends, leaves _a great gap_.    ALBERT.          [Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE INFORMED]      _Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._    OSBORNE, _7th December 1845._    Sir Robert Peel has informed the Queen that in consequence of  differences prevailing in the Cabinet, he is very reluctantly  compelled to solicit from the Queen the acceptance of his resignation,  which she has as reluctantly accepted.    From the Queen's unabated confidence in Lord Melbourne, her first  impulse was to request his immediate attendance here that she might  have the benefit of his assistance and advice, but on reflection the  Queen does not think herself justified, in the present state of Lord  Melbourne's health, to ask him to make the sacrifice which the return  to his former position of Prime Minister would, she fears, impose upon  him.    It is this consideration, and this _alone_, that has induced the Queen  to address to Lord John Russell the letter of which she sends a copy.  The Queen hopes, however, that Lord Melbourne will not withhold from  her new Government his advice, which would be so valuable to her.    It is of the _utmost importance_ that the whole of this communication  should be kept a _most profound secret_ until the Queen has seen Lord  John Russell.          [Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE'S ATTITUDE]      _Memorandum by the Prince Albert._    _8th December 1845._    Sir Robert helped us in the composition of the letters to Lord John  and to Lord Melbourne. We considered it necessary to write to the  latter, in consideration of the confidential position which he  formerly enjoyed.    Sir Robert Peel has not _resigned_, thinking it a matter of great  strength for the Sovereign to keep his ministry until a new one can be  got.    ALBERT.          _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._    BROCKET HALL, _9th December 1845._    Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has just  received your Majesty's letter of the 7th inst., which, of course,  has astonished him by the magnitude of the event which it announces,  although something of this sort has been long pending and to be  expected. Lord Melbourne returns your Majesty many thanks for  this communication, and more for your Majesty's great kindness and  consideration for him personally at the present moment. He is better,  but so long a journey would still not have been convenient to him,  and he has such a horror of the sea, that a voyage from Southampton  to Cowes or from Portsmouth to Ryde seems to him in prospect as  formidable as a voyage across the Atlantic.    Lord Melbourne will strictly observe your Majesty's injunction of  secrecy.    With respect to the kind wishes about office which your Majesty  is pleased to express, Lord Melbourne will of course give to your  Majesty's new Government, if formed under Lord John Russell, all the  support in his power, but as to taking office, he fears that he would  find some difficulty. He would be very unwilling to come in pledged  to a total and immediate reform of the Corn Law, and he also strongly  feels the difficulty which has in fact compelled Sir Robert Peel to  retire, viz. the difficulty of carrying on the Government upon the  principle of upholding and maintaining the present law with respect to  corn.    Lord Melbourne again thanks your Majesty for your great and  considerate kindness.          [Pageheading: PEEL'S ATTITUDE]      _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _10th December 1845._    Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and  influenced by no other motive than the desire to contribute if  possible to the relief of your Majesty from embarrassment, and the  protection of the public interests from injury, is induced to make  this confidential communication to your Majesty explanatory of his  position and intentions with regard to the great question which is now  agitating the public mind.    Your Majesty can, if you think fit, make this communication known to  the Minister who, as successor to Sir Robert Peel, may be honoured by  your Majesty's confidence.    On the first day of November last Sir Robert Peel advised his  colleagues, on account of the alarming accounts from Ireland and many  districts of Great Britain as to the failure of the potato crop from  disease, and for the purpose of guarding against contingencies which  in his opinion were not improbable, humbly to recommend to your  Majesty that the duties on the import of foreign grain should be  suspended for a limited period either by Order in Council, or by  Legislative Enactment, Parliament in either case being summoned  without delay.    Sir Robert Peel foresaw that this suspension, fully justified by the  tenor of the reports to which he has referred, would compel, during  the interval of suspension, the reconsideration of the Corn "]]]
