Hunc in  Pelicanum positum in arenae digestione non adeo calida per aliquod  tempus manere finito; Postmodum eximito vini Magisterium, de quo  locuti sumus._    But I dare not _Eleu._ lay much Weight upon this Process, because I  have found that if it were True, it would be but seldom Practicable in  this Country upon the best Wine: for Though this present Winter hath  been Extraordinary Cold, yet in very Keen Frosts accompanied with  lasting Snowes, I have not been able in any Measure to Freeze a thin  Vial full of Sack; and even with Snow and Salt I could Freeze little  more then the Surface of it; and I suppose _Eleu._ that tis not every  Degree of Cold that is Capable of Congealing Liquors, which is able to  make such an _Analysis_ (if I may so call it) of them by Separating  their Aqueous and Spirituous Parts; for I have sometimes, though not  often, frozen severally, Red-wine, Urine and Milk, but could not  Observe the expected Separation. And the Dutch-Men that were forc'd to  Winter in that Icie Region neer the Artick Circle, call'd _Nova  Zembla_, although they relate, as we shall see below, that there was a  Separation of Parts made in their frozen Beer about the middle of  _November_, yet of the Freezing of their Back [Errata: Sack] in  _December_ following they give but this Account: _Yea and our Sack,  which is so hot, was Frozen very hard, so that when we were every Man  to have his part, we were forc'd to melt it in the Fire; which we  shar'd every second Day, about half a Pinte for a Man, wherewith we  were forc'd to sustain our selves._ In which words they imply not,  that their Back [Errata: Sack] was divided by the Frost into differing  Substances, after such manner as their Beer had been. All which  notwithstanding, _Eleu._ suppose that it may be made to appear, that  even Cold sometimes may _Congregare Homogenea, & Heterogenea  Segregare_: and to Manifest this I may tell you, that I did once,  purposely cause to be Decocted in fair Water a Plant abounding with  Sulphureous and Spirituous Parts, and having expos'd the Decoction to  a keen North-Wind in a very Frosty Night, I observ'd, that the more  Aqueous Parts of it were turn'd by the next Morning into Ice, towards  the innermost part of which, the more Agile and Spirituous parts, as I  then conjectur'd, having Retreated, to shun as much as might be their  Environing Enemy, they had there preserv'd themselves unfrozen in the  Form of a high colour'd Liquor, the Aqueous and Spirituous parts  having been so sleightly (Blended rather than) United in the  Decoction, that they were easily Separable by such a Degree of Cold as  would not have been able to have Divorc'd the Parts of Urine or Wine,  which by Fermentation or Digestion are wont, as Tryal has inform'd me,  to be more intimately associated each with other. But I have already  intimated, _Eleutherius_, that I shall not Insist on this Experiment,  not only because, having made it but once I may possibly have been  mistaken in it; but also (and that principally) because of that much  more full and eminent Experiment of the Separative Virtue of extream  Cold, that was made, against their Wills, by the foremention'd Dutch  men that Winter'd in _Nova Zembla_; the Relation of whose Voyage being  a very scarce Book, it will not be amiss to give you that Memorable  part of it which concerns our present Theme, as I caus'd the Passage  to be extracted out of the Englished Voyage it self.    \"_Gerard de Veer_, _John Cornelyson_ and Others, sent out of  _Amsterdam_, _Anno Dom._ 1596. being forc'd by unseasonable Weather to  Winter in _Nova Zembla_, neer Ice-Haven; on the thirteenth of  _October_, Three of us (sayes the Relation) went aboard the Ship, and  laded a Sled with Beer; but when we had laden it, thinking to go to  our House with it, suddenly there arose such a Winde, and so great a  Storm and Cold, that we were forc'd to go into the Ship again, because  we were not able to stay without; and we could not get the Beer into  the Ship again, but were forc'd to let it stand without upon the Sled:  the Fourteenth, as we came out of the Ship, we found the Barrel of  Beer standing upon the Sled, but it was fast frozen at the Heads; yet  by reason of the great Cold, the Beer that purg'd out froze as hard  upon the Side of the Barrel, as if it had been glu'd thereon: and in  that sort we drew it to our House, and set the Barrel an end, and  drank it up; but first we were forc'd to melt the Beer, for there was  scarce any unfrozen Beer in the barrel; but in that thick Yiest that  was unfrozen lay the Strength of the Beer, so that it was too strong  to drink alone, and that which was frozen tasted like Water; and being  melted we Mix'd one with the other, and so drank it; but it had  neither Strength nor Taste.\"    And on this Occasion I remember, that having the last very Sharp  Winter purposely try'd to Freeze, among other Liquors, some Beer  moderately strong, in Glass Vessels, with Snow and Salt, I observ'd,  that there came out of the Neck a certain thick Substance, which, it  seems, was much better able then the rest of the Liquor (that I found  turn'd into Ice) to resist a Frost, and which, by its Colour and  consistence seem'd mafestly [Transcriber's Note: manifestly] enough  to be Yiest, whereat, I confess, I somewhat marvail'd, because I did  not either discerne by the Taste, or find by Enquiry, that the Beer  was at all too New to be very fit to be Drank. I might confirm the  Dutchmens Relation, by what happen'd a while since to a neere Friend  of mine, who complained to me, that having Brew'd some Beer or Ale for  his own drinking in _Holland_ (where he then dwelt) the Keenness of  the late bitter Winter froze the Drink so as to reduce it into Ice,  and a small Proportion of a very Strong and Spirituous Liquor. But I  must not entertain you any longer concerning Cold, not onely because  you may think I have but lost my way into a Theme which does not  directly belong to my present Undertaking; but because I have already  enlarg'd my self too much upon the first Consideration I propos'd,  though it appears so much a Paradox, that it seem'd to Require that I  should say much to keep it from being thought a meere Extravagance;  yet since I Undertook but to make the common Assumption of our  Chymists and _Aristotelians_ appear Questionable, I hope I have so  Perform'd that Task, that I may now Proceed to my Following  Considerations, and Insist lesse on them than I have done on the  First.          THE    SCEPTICAL CHYMIST.    _The Second Part._      The Second Consideration I Desire to have Notice Taken of, is This,  That it is not so Sure, as Both Chymists and _Aristotelians_ are wont  to Think it, that every Seemingly Similar or Distinct Substance that  is Separated from a Body by the Help of the Fire, was Pre existent in  it as a Principle or Element of it.    That I may not make this Paradox a Greater then I needs must, I will  First Briefly Explain what the Proposition means, before I proceed to  Argue for it.    And I suppose You will easily Believe That I do not mean that any  thing is separable from a Body by Fire, that was not Materially  pre-existent in it; for it Far Exceeds the power of Meerly Naturall  Agents, and Consequently of the Fire, to produce anew, so Much as one  Atome of Matter, which they can but Modifie and Alter, not Create;  which is so Obvious a Truth, that almost all Sects of Philosophers  have Deny'd the Power of producing Matter to Second Causes; and the  _Epicureans_ and some Others have Done the Like, in Reference to their  Gods themselves.    Nor does the Proposition peremptorily Deny but that some Things  Obtain'd by the Fire from a Mixt Body, may have been more then barely  Materially pre-existent in it, since there are Concretes, which before  they be Expos'd to the Fire afford us several Documents of their  abounding, some with Salt, and Others with Sulphur. For it will serve  the present Turn, if it appear that diverse things Obtain'd from a  Mixt Body expos'd to the Fire, were not its Ingredients Before: for if  this be made to appear it, will [Errata: appear, it will] be Rationall  enough to suspect that Chymists may Decieve themselves, and Others,  in concluding Resolutely and Universally, those Substances to be the  Elementary Ingredients of Bodies barely separated by the Fire, of  which it yet may be Doubted Whether there be such or No; at least till  some other Argument then that drawn from the _Analysis_ be Brought to  resolve the Doubt.    That then which I Mean by the Proposition I am Explaining, is, That it  may without Absurdity be Doubted whether or no the Differing  Substances Obtainable from a Concrete Dissipated by the Fire were so  Exsistent in it in that Forme (at least as to their minute Parts)  wherein we find them when the _Analysis_ is over, that the Fire did  only Dis-joyne and Extricate the Corpuscles of one Principle from  those of the other wherewith before they were Blended.    Having thus Explain'd my Proposition, I shall endeavour to do two  things, to prove it; The first of which is to shew that such  Substances as Chymists call Principles May be produc'd _De novo_ (as  they speak.) And the other is to make it probable that by the Fire we  may Actually obtain from some Mixt Bodies such Substances as were not  in the Newly Expounded sence, pre-existent in them.    To begin then with the First of these, I Consider that if it be as  true as 'tis probable, that Compounded Bodies Differ from One Another  but in the Various Textures Resulting from the Bigness, Shape, Motion,  and contrivance of their smal parts, It will not be Irrationall to  conceive that one and the same parcel of the Universal Matter may by  Various Alterations and Contextures be brought to Deserve the Name,  somtimes of a Sulphureous, and sometimes of a Terrene, or Aqueous  Body. And this I could more largely Explicate,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#14)"],[1,"a benefit to his health, for it  satisfied his sensitive conscience and soothed his tender heart to \"make  good\" in that way.    Drink and misdirected enthusiasm interfered with Denton Offutt's  success. After about a year in New Salem he \"busted up,\" as the  neighbors expressed it, and left his creditors in the lurch. Among them  was the clerk he had boasted so much about. For a short time Abe Lincoln  needed a home, and found a hearty welcome with Jack Armstrong, the best  fighter of Clary's Grove!    J. G. Holland wrote, in his \"Life of Abraham Lincoln,\" of the young  man's progress during his first year in New Salem:    \"The year that Lincoln was in Denton Offutt's store was one of great  advance. He had made new and valuable acquaintances, read many books,  won multitudes of friends, and become ready for a step further in  advance. Those who could appreciate brains respected him, and those  whose ideas of a man related to his muscles were devoted to him. It was  while he was performing the work of the store that he acquired the  nickname, 'Honest Abe'--a characterization that he never dishonored, an  abbreviation that he never outgrew. He was everybody's friend, the  best-natured, the most sensible, the best-informed, the most modest and  unassuming, the kindest, gentlest, roughest, strongest, best fellow in  all New Salem and the region round about.\"          CHAPTER XI    POLITICS, WAR, STOREKEEPING AND STUDYING LAW      STUDYING GRAMMAR FIRST    By \"a step still further in advance\" Dr. Holland must have meant the  young clerk's going into politics. He had made many friends in New  Salem, and they reflected back his good-will by urging him to run for  the State Legislature. Before doing this he consulted Mentor Graham, the  village schoolmaster, with whom he had worked as election clerk when he  first came to the place. Abe could read, write and cipher, but he felt  that if he should succeed in politics, he would disgrace his office and  himself by not speaking and writing English correctly.    The schoolmaster advised: \"If you expect to go before the public in any  capacity, I think the best thing you can do is to study English  grammar.\"    \"If I had a grammar I would commence now,\" sighed Abe.    Mr. Graham thought one could be found at Vaner's, only six miles away.  So Abe got up and started for it as fast as he could stride. In an  incredibly short time he returned with a copy of Kirkham's Grammar, and  set to work upon it at once. Sometimes he would steal away into the  woods, where he could study \"out loud\" if he desired. He kept up his old  habit of sitting up nights to read, and as lights were expensive, the  village cooper allowed him to stay in his shop, where he burned the  shavings and studied by the blaze as he had done in Indiana, after every  one else had gone to bed. So it was not long before young Lincoln, with  the aid of Schoolmaster Graham, had mastered the principles of English  grammar, and felt himself better equipped to enter politics and public  life. Some of his rivals, however, did not trouble themselves about  speaking and writing correctly.      GOING INTO POLITICS    James Rutledge, a \"substantial\" citizen, and the former owner of  Rutledge's mill and dam, was the president of the New Salem debating  club. Young Lincoln joined this society, and when he first rose to  speak, everybody began to smile in anticipation of a funny story, but  Abe proceeded to discuss the question before the house in very good  form. He was awkward in his movements and gestures at first, and amused  those present by thrusting his unwieldy hands deep into his pockets, but  his arguments were so well-put and forcible that all who heard him were  astonished.    Mr. Rutledge, that night after Abe's maiden effort at the lyceum, told  his wife:    \"There is more in Abe Lincoln's head than mere wit and fun. He is  already a fine speaker. All he needs is culture to fit him for a high  position in public life.\"    But there were occasions enough where something besides culture was  required. A man who was present and heard Lincoln's first real stump  speech describes his appearance and actions in the following picturesque  language:    \"He wore a mixed jean coat, clawhammer style, short in the sleeves and  bob-tail--in fact, it was so short in the tail that he could not sit  upon it--flax and tow linen pantaloons, and a straw hat. I think he wore  a vest, but do not remember how it looked. He wore pot metal (top)  boots.    \"His maiden effort on the stump was a speech on the occasion of a public  sale at Pappyville, a village eleven miles from Springfield. After the  sale was over and speechmaking had begun, a fight--a 'general fight' as  one of the bystanders relates--ensued, and Lincoln, noticing one of his  friends about to succumb to the attack of an infuriated ruffian,  interposed to prevent it. He did so most effectually. Hastily descending  from the rude platform, he edged his way through the crowd, and seizing  the bully by the neck and the seat of his trousers, threw him by means  of his great strength and long arms, as one witness stoutly insists,  'twelve feet away.' Returning to the stand, and throwing aside his hat,  he inaugurated his campaign with the following brief and juicy  declaration:    \"'Fellow-Citizens: I presume you all know who I am. I am humble Abraham  Lincoln. I have been solicited by many friends to become a candidate  for the Legislature. My politics are \"short and sweet\" like the old  woman's dance. I am in favor of national bank. I am in favor of the  internal improvement system, and a high protective tariff. These are my  sentiments and political principles. If elected, I shall be thankful; if  not, it will be all the same.'\"    The only requirement for a candidate for the Illinois Legislature in  1832 was that he should announce his \"sentiments.\" This Lincoln did,  according to custom, in a circular of about two thousand words,  rehearsing his experiences on the Sangamon River and in the community of  New Salem. For a youth who had just turned twenty-three, who had never  been to school a year in his life, who had no political training, and  had never made a political speech, it was a bold and dignified document,  closing as follows:    \"Considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend  youth, it is probable I have already been presuming more than becomes  me. However, upon the subjects of which I have treated, I have spoken as  I have thought. I may be wrong in regard to any or all of them, but,  holding it a sound maxim that it is better only sometimes to be right  than at all times to be wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be  erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.    \"Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether this is true  or not, I can say for one, that I have no other so great as that of  being truly esteemed of my fellow-men by rendering myself worthy of  their esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet  to be developed. I am young and unknown to many of you. I was born, and  have ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy  or popular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown  exclusively upon the independent voters of the country; and, if elected,  they will have conferred a favor on me for which I shall be unremitting  in my labors to compensate. But if the good people in their wisdom shall  see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with  disappointments to be very much chagrined.\"      \"CAPTAIN LINCOLN\"    Lincoln had hardly launched in his first political venture when, in  April, 1832, a messenger arrived in New Salem with the announcement from  Governor Reynolds, of Illinois, that the Sacs and other hostile tribes,  led by Black Hawk, had invaded the northern part of the State, spreading  terror among the white settlers in that region. The governor called upon  those who were willing to help in driving back the Indians to report at  Beardstown, on the Illinois River, within a week.    Lincoln and other Sangamon County men went at once to Richmond where a  company was formed. The principal candidate for captain was a man named  Kirkpatrick, who had treated Lincoln shabbily when Abe, in one of the  odd jobs he had done in that region, worked in Kirkpatrick's sawmill.  The employer had agreed to buy his hired man a cant-hook for handling  the heavy logs. As there was a delay in doing this, Lincoln told him he  would handle the logs without the cant-hook if Kirkpatrick would pay him  the two dollars that implement would cost. The employer promised to do  this, but never gave him the money.    So when Lincoln saw that Kirkpatrick was a candidate for the captaincy,  he said to Greene, who had worked with him in Offutt's store:    \"Bill, I believe I can make Kirkpatrick pay me that two dollars he owes  me on the cant-hook now. I guess I'll run against him for captain.\"    Therefore Abe Lincoln announced himself as a candidate. The vote was  taken in an odd way. It was announced that when the men heard the  command to march, each should go and stand by the man he wished to have  for captain. The command was given. At the word, \"March,\" three-fourths  of the company rallied round Abe Lincoln. More than twenty-five years  afterward, when Lincoln was a candidate for the presidency of the United  States, he referred to himself in the third person in describing this  incident, saying that he was elected \"to his own surprise,\" and \"he says  he has not since had any success in life which gave him so much  satisfaction.\"      IGNORANCE OF MILITARY TACTICS    But Lincoln was a \"raw hand\" at military tactics. He used to enjoy  telling of his ignorance and the expedients adopted in giving his  commands to the company. Once when he was marching, twenty men abreast,  across a field it became necessary to pass through a narrow gateway into  the"]]]
