The trio were evidently a  mother and twins. The captain was anxious to secure the cubs alive as  trophies, and was cautious in shooting at the mother. All three fell,  and were brought on board the _Isabel_. He records that it was quite  heartrending to see the affection that existed between them. When the  cubs saw their mother was wounded, they commenced licking her wounds,  regardless of their own sufferings. At length the mother began to eat  the snow, a sure sign that she was mortally wounded. \"Even then her care  for the cubs did not cease, as she kept continually turning her head  from one to the other, and, though roaring with pain, she seemed to warn  them to escape if possible. Their attachment was as great as hers, and I  was thus obliged to destroy them all. It went much against my feelings,  but the memory of my starving dogs reconciled me to the necessity.\"    The female bear when pursued carries or pushes her cubs forwards, and  the little creatures are described as placing themselves across her path  to be shoved forwards. Scoresby mentions an instance where, when  projected some yards in advance, the cubs ran on until she overtook  them, when they alternately adjusted themselves for a second throw.    It is chiefly on the seal that this bear feeds, and it displays great  cunning in catching them as they sleep on the ice, or come to the holes  in the ice to breathe, when it destroys them with one blow of its  formidable and heavy paw. For its mode of getting the walrus we refer  the reader to \"Excelsior,\" vol. i. p. 37. Notwithstanding his strength  and ferocity, the Esquimaux frequently kill the polar bear, as they  esteem its flesh and fat, and highly prize its skin. The flesh is not so  prized by Saxons, whether they be European or American. Dr Kane's  opinion would differ but little from that of Arctic voyagers on our side  of the Atlantic. The surgeon to the \"Grinnell Expedition\" in search of  Sir John Franklin thus characterises its flesh: \"Bear is strong, very  strong, and withal most capricious meat; you cannot tell where to find  him. One day he is quite beefy and bearable; another, hircine, hippuric,  and detestable.\"    It is but fair to say that Captain Parry[38] regards the flesh of the  polar bear to be as wholesome as any other, though not quite so  palatable. His men suffered from indigestion after eating it; but this  he attributes to the quantity, and not to the quality, of the meat they  had eaten.    There seems to be little doubt that the liver is highly deleterious.  Some of the sailors of Barentz, who made a meal of it, were very sick,  \"and we verily thought we should have lost them, for all their skins  came off from the foot to the head.\"    The skin of the bear is covered with long yellowish white hair, which,  is very close, and forms a wonderful defence against the cold, and  against the tusk of the animals on which it feeds. We heard of another  use of this hair from an officer on one of the late Arctic searching  expeditions. A bear was seen to come down a tolerably high and steep  declivity by sliding down on its hinder quarters, in an attitude known,  in more than one part of the British Islands, by the expressive name of  \"katy-hunkers;\" the shaggy hair with which it was covered serving like a  thick mat to protect the creature from injury. The Esquimaux prepare the  skin sometimes without ripping it up, and turning the hairy side inward  a warm sack-like bed is formed, into which they creep, and lie very  comfortably. Otho Fabricius, in his \"Fauna Graenlandica\" (p. 24), informs  us that the tendons are converted into sewing threads. The female bear  has one or two, and sometimes three, cubs at a time. They are born in  the winter, and the mother generally digs for them and for herself a  snug nestling-place in the snow. The males in the winter time leave the  coast, and go out on the ice-fields, to the edge of the open water after  seals.--_Adam White, in \"Excelsior\" (with additions)._      NELSON AND THE POLAR BEAR.    In 1773, Captain Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave, sailed on a voyage of  discovery towards the North Pole. In this expedition sailed two Norfolk  young men, one in his twenty-third year, the other a mere lad in his  fifteenth year. The former sailed from a spirit of curiosity, and being  sorely distressed by sea-sickness was landed in Norway. He afterwards  became famous in the British Parliament, and the speeches of the Right  Hon. William Windham, Secretary at War, are often referred to even now.  The younger man was Horatio Nelson, cockswain under Captain Lutwidge,  who was killed at the battle of Trafalgar, thirty-two years after his  Polar expedition, and left a name which is synonymous with the glory of  the British navy.    Southey, in his admirable life,[39] records an instance of his hardihood  on this expedition:--\"One night, during the mid-watch, he stole from the  ship with one of his comrades, taking advantage of a rising fog, and set  off over the ice in pursuit of a bear. It was not long before they were  missed. The fog thickened, and Captain Lutwidge and his officers became  exceedingly alarmed for their safety. Between three and four in the  morning the weather cleared, and the two adventurers were seen at a  considerable distance from the ship attacking a huge bear. The signal  for them to return was immediately made; Nelsons' comrade called upon  him to obey it, but in vain; his musket had flashed in the pan; their  ammunition was expended; and a chasm in the ice, which divided him from  the bear, probably preserved his life. 'Never mind,' he cried; 'do but  let me get a blow at this devil with the butt-end of my musket, and we  shall have him.' Captain Lutwidge, however, seeing his danger, fired a  gun, which had the desired effect of frightening the beast; and the boy  then returned, somewhat afraid of the consequences of his trespass. The  captain reprimanded him sternly for conduct so unworthy of the office  which he filled, and desired to know what motive he could have for  hunting a bear. 'Sir,' said he, pouting his lip, as he was wont to do  when agitated, 'I wished to kill the bear, that I might carry the skin  to my father.'\"      A CLEVER POLAR BEAR.    Mr Markham,[40] when the ship _Assistance_ was in the Wellington  Channel, observed several bears prowling about in search of seals. \"On  one occasion,\" he writes, \"I saw a bear swimming across a lane of water,  and pushing a large piece of ice before him. Landing on the floe, he  advanced stealthily towards a couple of seals, which were basking in the  sun at some little distance, still holding the ice in front to hide his  black muzzle; but this most sagacious of bears was for once outwitted,  for the seals dived into a pool of water before he could get within  reach. On another occasion, a female Bruin having been shot from the  deck of the _Intrepid_, her affectionate cub, an animal about the size  of a large Newfoundland dog, remained resolutely by the side of its  mother, and on the approach of the commander of the _Intrepid_ with part  of his crew, a sort of tournament ensued, in which the youthful bear,  although belaboured most savagely, showed a gallant resistance, and at  length rushing between the legs of the corporal of marines, laid him  prostrate on the ice, floored another man, who had seized hold of his  tail, and effected his escape.\"      CAPTAIN OMMANEY AND THE POLAR BEAR.    Captain Ommaney,[41] who led one of the travelling parties in 1851 sent  out from the ships under Austin in search of Franklin on the 12th of  June, the day before he arrived at the ships, met with a laughable  accident, although it might have had a serious termination. They had all  of them but just got into their blanket bags, when a peculiar noise, as  if something was rubbing up the snow, was heard outside. The gallant  captain instantly divined its cause, seized, loaded, and cocked his gun,  and ordered the tent door to be opened, upon which a huge bear was seen  outside. Captain Ommaney fired at the animal, but, whether from the  benumbed state of his limbs, or the dim glimmering light, he  unfortunately missed him, and shot away the rope that supported the tent  instead. The enraged monster then poked his head against the poles, and  the tent fell upon its terrified inmates, and embraced them in its  folds. Their confusion and dismay can more easily be imagined than  described, but at length one man, with more self-possession than the  rest, slipped out of his bag, scrambled from under the prostrate tent,  and ran to the sledge for another gun; and it was well that he did so,  for no sooner had he vacated his sleeping sack than Bruin seized it  between his teeth, and shook it violently, with the evident intention of  wreaking his vengeance on its inmate. He was, however, speedily  despatched by a well-aimed shot from the man, the tent was repitched,  and tranquillity restored.

There are other species that  find habitats to their taste in the most elevated localities, ranging  at will in the summer time over the bald summits in the regions of  perpetual snow. Among these may be mentioned the brown-capped  leucostictes, the American pipits, the ravens, and Brewer's blackbirds.  These species will often have the privilege of looking upon the scenery  on both sides of the range, and you and I can scarcely repress a feeling  of envy when we think of their happy freedom, and their frequent  opportunities to go sightseeing.    While taking an early morning stroll along one of the streets of  Glenwood, I caught sight of a new member of the phoebe family, its  reddish breast and sides differentiating it from the familiar phoebe  of the East. Afterwards I identified it as Say's phoebe, a distinctly  western species. Its habits are like those of its eastern relative. A  pair of Say's phoebes had placed their nest on a beam of a veranda,  near the roof, where they could be seen carrying food to their young. My  notes say nothing of their singing a tune or even uttering a chirp. This  was my first observation of Say's phoebe, although, as will be seen, I  subsequently saw one under somewhat peculiar circumstances.    Having spent all the time I could spare at Glenwood, one morning I  boarded the eastward-bound train, and was soon whirling up through the  sublime canyons of Grand and Eagle Rivers, keeping on the alert for such  birds as I could see from the car-window. Few birds, as has been said,  can be seen in the dark gorges of the mountains, the species that are  most frequently descried being the turtle doves, with now and then a  small flock of blackbirds. The open, sunlit valleys of the upper  mountains, watered by the brawling streams, are much more to the liking  of many birds, especially the mountain song-sparrows, the white-crowned  sparrows, the green-tailed towhees, and Audubon's and Wilson's warblers.  Up, up, for many miles the double-headed train crept, tooting and  puffing hard, until at length it reached the highest point on the route,  which is Tennessee Pass, through the tunnel of which it swept with a  sullen roar, issuing into daylight on the eastern side, where the waters  of the streams flow eastward instead of westward. The elevation of this  tunnel is ten thousand four hundred and eighteen feet, which is still  about a thousand feet below the timber-line. A minute after emerging  from the tunnel's mouth I caught sight of a red-shafted flicker which  went bolting across the narrow valley. The train swept down the valley  for some miles, stopped long enough to have another engine coupled to  the one that had brought us down from the tunnel, then wheeled to the  left and began the ascent to the city of Leadville. This city is  situated on a sloping plain on the mountain side, in full view of many  bald mountain peaks whose gorges are filled with deep snow-drifts  throughout the summer. For some purposes Leadville may be an exceedingly  desirable city, but it has few attractions for the ornithologist. I took  a long walk through a part of the city, and, whether you will believe it  or not, I did not see a single bird outside of a cage, not even a  house-finch or an English sparrow, nor did I see one tree in my entire  stroll along the busy streets. The caged birds seen were a canary and a  cardinal, and, oddly enough, both of them were singing, mayhap for very  homesickness.    Why should a bird student tarry here? What was there to keep him in a  birdless place like this? I decided to leave at once, and so, checking  my baggage through to Buena Vista, I started afoot down the mountain  side, determined to walk to Malta, a station five miles below, observing  the birds along the way. Not a feathered lilter was seen until I had  gone about a mile from Leadville, when a disconsolate robin appeared  among some scraggy pine bushes, not uttering so much as a chirp by way  of greeting.    A few minutes later I heard a vigorous and musical chirping in the pine  bushes, and, turning aside, found a flock of small, finch-like birds.  They flitted about so rapidly that it was impossible to get a good view  of them with my glasses; but such glimpses as I obtained revealed a  prevailing grayish, streaked with some darker color, while a glint of  yellow in their wings and tails was displayed as the birds flew from  bush to bush. When the wings were spread, a narrow bar of yellow or  whitish-yellow seemed to stretch across them lengthwise, giving them a  gauzy appearance. The birds remained together in a more or less compact  flock. They uttered a loud, clear chirp that was almost musical, and  also piped a quaint trill that was almost as low and harsh as that of  the little clay-colored sparrow, although occasionally one would lift  his voice to a much higher pitch. What were these tenants of the dry and  piney mountain side? They were pine siskins, which I had ample  opportunity to study in my rambles among the mountains in 1901.    [Illustration: _Pine Siskins_]    A mile farther down, a lone mountain bluebird appeared in sight, perched  on a gray stump on the gray hillside, and keeping as silent as if it  were a crime in bluebird-land to utter a sound. This bird's breeding  range extends from the plains to the timber-line; and he dwells on both  sides of the mountains, for I met with him at Glenwood. About a half  mile above Malta a western nighthawk was seen, hurtling in his  eccentric, zigzag flight overhead, uttering his strident call, and  \"hawking for flies,\" as White of Selborne would phrase it. A western  grassfinch flew over to some bushes with a morsel in its bill, but I  could not discover its nest or young, search as I would. Afterwards it  perched on a telegraph wire and poured out its evening voluntary, which  was the precise duplicate of the trills of the grassfinches of eastern  North America. There seems to be only a slight difference between the  eastern and western forms of these birds, so slight, indeed, that they  can be distinguished only by having the birds in hand.    Turtle doves were also plentiful in the valley above Malta, as they were  in most suitable localities. Here were also several western robins, one  of which saluted me with a cheerful carol, whose tone and syllabling  were exactly like those of the merry redbreast of our Eastern States. I  was delighted to find the sweet-voiced white-crowned sparrows tenants of  this valley, although they were not so abundant here as they had been a  little over a week before in the hollows below the summit of Pike's  Peak. But what was the bird which was singing so blithely a short  distance up the slope? He remained hidden until I drew near, when he  ran off on the ground like a frightened doe, and was soon ensconced in a  sage bush. Note his chestnut crest and greenish back. This is the  green-tailed towhee. He is one of the finest vocalists of the Rocky  Mountains, his tones being strong and well modulated, his execution  almost perfect as to technique, and his entire song characterized by a  quality that might be defined as human expressiveness.    A pair of western chipping sparrows were feeding their young in one of  the sage bushes. I hoped to find a nest, but my quest simply proved that  the bantlings had already left their nurseries. It was some  satisfaction, however, to establish the fact at first hand that the  western chipping sparrows breed at an elevation of nine thousand five  hundred and eighty feet above sea-level.    While strolling about a short distance above the town, I discovered an  underground passage leading to some of the factories, or perhaps the  smelting works, a few miles farther up the valley. The over-arching  ground and timbers forming the roof were broken through at various  places, making convenient openings for the unwary pedestrian to tumble  through should he venture to stroll about here by night. Suddenly a  little broad-shouldered bird appeared from some mysterious quarter, and  flitted silently about from bush to bush or from one tussock of grass to  another. To my surprise, he presently dropped into one of the openings  of the subterranean passage, disappeared for a few moments, and then  emerged from another opening a little farther away. The bird--let me say  at once--was Say's phoebe, with which, as previously told, I made  acquaintance at Glenwood. He may be recognized by the reddish or  cinnamon-brown cast of his abdomen and sides. Again and again he darted  into the passage, perhaps to make sure that his bairns had not been  kidnapped, and then came up to keep a vigilant eye on his visitor, whom  he was not wholly disposed to trust. I am not sure that there was a nest  in the subterranean passage, as my time was too short to look for it.  Others may not regard it as an important ornithological discovery, and I  do not pretend that it was epoch-making, but to me it was at least  interesting to find this species, which was new to me, dwelling at an  elevation of five thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight feet on the  western side of the range, and on the eastern side at an elevation of  nine thousand five hundred and eighty feet. Nowhere else in my  peregrinations among the Rockies did I so much as catch a glimpse of  Say's phoebe.[6]        [6] In 1901 this bird was seen by me in South Park, and its quaint      whistle was heard,--it says _Phe-by_, but its tone and expression      are different from those of its eastern relative. See the chapter      entitled \"Pleasant Outings.\"    With the exception of some swallows circling about in the air, I saw no  other birds during my brief stay at Malta. I was sorely disappointed in  not being able to find accommodation at this place, for it had been my  intention to remain here for the night, and walk the next day to a  station called Granite, some seventeen miles farther down the valley,  making"]]]
