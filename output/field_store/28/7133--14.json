That ill effects follow, in a majority of cases, is not to be doubted;  but this is easily and sufficiently accounted for upon quite other  grounds. Perhaps, however, the following propositions may be safely  stated: That in general practice, with the grades and mixed animals  common in the country, _close-breeding should be scrupulously avoided_  as highly detrimental. It is better _always_ to avoid breeding from near  relatives whenever stock-getters of the same breed and of equal merit  can be obtained which are not related. Yet, where this is not possible,  or where there is some desirable and clearly defined purpose in view--as  the fixing and perpetuating of some valuable quality in a particular  animal not common to the breed--and the breeder possesses the knowledge  and skill needful to accomplish his purpose, and the animals are perfect  in health and development, close breeding may be practised with  advantage.    The practice of _crossing_, like that of close breeding, has its strong  and its weak side. Judiciously practised, it offers a means of  providing animals _for the butcher_, often superior to, and more  profitable than, those of any pure breed. It is also admissible as the  foundation of a systematic and well-considered attempt to establish a  new breed. But when crossing is practised injudiciously and  indiscriminately, and especially when so done for the purpose of  procuring _breeding animals_, it is scarcely less objectionable than  careless in-and-in breeding.    [Illustration: A SPRIGHTLY YOUTH.]    The profitable style of breeding for the great majority of farmers to  adopt, is neither to cross nor to breed from close affinities--except in  rare instances, and for some specific and clearly understood  purpose--but to _breed in the line_; that is, to select the breed or  race best adapted to fulfil the requirement demanded, whether it be for  the dairy, for labor, or for such combination of these as can be had  without too great a sacrifice of the principal requisite, and then to  procure a _pure-bred_ male of the kind determined upon, and breed him to  the females of the herd; and if these be not such as are calculated to  develop his qualities, endeavor by purchase or exchange to procure such  as will. Let the progeny of these be bred to another _pure-bred_ male of  the same breed, but as distantly related to the first as may be. Let  this plan be faithfully pursued, and, although we cannot, without the  intervention of well-bred females, procure stock purely of the kind  desired, yet in several generations--if proper care be given to the  selection of males, that each one be such as to retain and improve upon  the points gained by his predecessor--the stock, for most practical  purposes, will be as good as if thorough-bred. If this plan were  generally adopted, and a system of letting or exchanging males  established, the cost might be brought within the means of most persons,  and the advantages which would accrue would be almost beyond belief.    A brief summing-up of the foregoing principles may not be inappropriate  here.    The law of similarity teaches us to select animals for breeding which  possess the desired forms and qualities in the greatest perfection and  best combination.    Regard should be had, not only to the more obvious characteristics, but  also to such hereditary traits and tendencies as may be hidden from  cursory observation and demand careful and thorough investigation.    From the hereditary nature of all characteristics, whether good or bad,  we learn the importance of having all desirable qualities _thoroughly  inbred_; or, in other words, so firmly in each generation that the next  is warrantably certain to present nothing worse--that no ill results  follow from breeding back to some inferior ancestor--that all  undesirable traits or points be, so far as possible, _bred-out_.    So important is this consideration, that, in practice, it is decidedly  preferable to employ a male of ordinary external appearance--provided  his ancestry be all which is desired--rather than a grade, or  cross-bred animal, although the latter be greatly his superior in  personal beauty.    A knowledge of the law of variation teaches us to avoid, for breeding  purposes, such animals as exhibit variations unfavorable to the purpose  in view; to endeavor to perpetuate every real improvement gained; as  well as to secure, as far as practicable, the conditions necessary to  induce or continue any improvement, such as general treatment, food,  climate, habits, and the like.    Where the parents do not possess the perfections desired, selections for  coupling should be made with critical reference to correcting the faults  or deficiencies of one by corresponding excellencies in the other.    To correct defects, too much must not be attempted at once. Pairing  those very unlike oftener results in loss than gain. Avoid all extremes,  and endeavor by moderate degrees to attain the end desired.    Crossing, between different breeds, for the purpose of obtaining animals  for the shambles, may be advantageously practised to a considerable  extent, but not for the production of breeding animals. As a general  rule, cross-bred males should not be employed for propagation, and  cross-bred females should be served by thorough-bred males.    In ordinary practice, breeding from near relatives is to be scrupulously  avoided. For certain purposes, under certain conditions and  circumstances, and in the hands of a skillful breeder, it may be  practised with advantage--but not otherwise.    In a large majority of cases--other things being equal--we may expect in  progeny the outward form and general structure of the sire, together  with the internal qualities, constitution, and nutritive system of the  dam; each, however, modified by the other.    Particular care should always be taken that the male by which the dam  first becomes pregnant is the best which can be obtained; also, that at  the time of sexual congress both are in vigorous health.    Breeding animals should not be allowed to become fat, but always kept in  thrifty condition; and such as are intended for the butcher should never  be fat but once.    In deciding with what breeds to stock a farm, endeavor to select those  best adapted to its surface, climate, and degree of fertility; also,  with reference to probable demand and proximity to markets.    No expense incurred in procuring choice animals for propagation, no  amount of skill in breeding, can supersede, or compensate for, a lack of  liberal feeding and good treatment. The better the stock, the better  care they deserve.      PREGNANCY    The symptoms of pregnancy in its early stage were formerly deemed  exceedingly unsatisfactory. The period of being in season--which  commonly lasts three or four days, and then ceases for a while, and  returns in about three weeks--might entirely pass over; and, although it  was then probable that conception had taken place, yet in a great many  instances the hopes of the breeder were disappointed. It was not until  between the third and fourth month, when the belly began to enlarge--or,  in many cases, considerably later--and when the motions of the foetus  might be seen, or, at all events, felt by pressing on the right flank,  that the farmer could be assured that his cow was in calf.    That greatest of improvements in veterinary practice, the application of  the ear to the chest and belly of various animals, in order to detect by  the different sounds--which after a short time, will be easily  recognized--the state of the circulation through most of the organs, and  consequently, the precise seat and degree of inflammation and danger,  has now enabled the breeder to ascertain the existence of pregnancy at  as early a stage as six or eight weeks. The beating of the heart of the  calf may then be distinctly heard, twice, or more than twice, as  frequent as that of the mother; and each pulsation will betray the  singular double beating of the foetal heart. This will also be  accompanied by the audible rushing of the blood through the vessels of  the placenta. The ear should be applied to the right flank, beginning on  the higher part of it, and gradually shifting downward and backward.  These sounds will thus soon be heard, and cannot be mistaken.      TREATMENT BEFORE CALVING.    Little alteration needs to be made in the management of the cow for the  first seven months of pregnancy; except that, as she has not only to  yield milk for the profit of the farmer, but to nourish the growing  foetus within, she should be well, yet not too luxuriantly, fed. The  half-starved cow will not adequately discharge this double duty, nor  provide sufficient nutriment for the calf when it has dropped; while the  cow in high condition will be dangerously disposed to inflammation and  fever, when, at the time of parturition, she is otherwise so  susceptible of the power of every stimulus. If the season and the  convenience of the farmer will allow, she will be better at pasture, at  least for some hours each day than when confined altogether to the  cow-house.    At a somewhat uncertain period before she calves, there will be a new  secretion of milk for the expected little one; and under the notion of  somewhat recruiting her strength, in order better to enable her to  discharge her new duty--but more from the uniform testimony of  experience that there is danger of local inflammation, general fever,  garget in the udder, and puerperal fever, if the new milk descends while  the old milk continues to flow--it has been usual to let the cow _go  dry_ for some period before parturition. Farmers and breeders have been  strangely divided as to the length of this period. It must be decided by  circumstances. A cow in good condition may be milked for a much longer  period than a poor one.

Not only the bodily factors like nutrition and  circulation and sexual functions have a thousandfold influence on the  psychophysical processes, and these in turn change the vegetative  functions of the body, but especially the other parts of the brain and  nervous system can be affected in most different ways. If we want to  consider whether a certain variation of the personality demands curative  treatment, we certainly cannot confine ourselves to the mental  variations. They are after all only parts of the whole group of changes  in the organism and are thus symptoms of a disease which has to be  studied in its totality. The mental symptoms alone may be relatively  slight variations, which in themselves might be sufficiently balanced  not to disturb the equilibrium of life, and yet they may be symptoms of  a brain disturbance which as a whole must interfere with the safety of  life. On the other hand, mental life may appear like a chaos and yet the  disturbance may be the symptom of merely a slight brain affection and  the treatment of the mental symptoms in their apparent severity would be  a useless effort. The mental disturbance, for instance, of the  intoxicated or the hashish smoker, even the delirium of the feverish,  does not suggest a fight against the mental symptoms during the attack.    On the whole, there is a far-reaching independence between the apparent  mental variations and the seriousness of the brain affection. Light  hysteric states may produce a strong absenting of the mind while severe  epileptic conditions of the brain may be accompanied by very slight  mental changes. Every neurasthenic state may play havoc with mental  life, while grave brain destructions may only shade slightly the  character or the intellect. To deal with the mental changes as if they  belonged to a sphere by itself, to the soul which is well or ill through  its own independent alterations without steadily relating the changes to  the total organism, leads therefore necessarily to failure. The mind  reflects only symptoms of the disease; the disease itself belongs always  to the organism. Psychotherapy has suffered too much from the belief  that the removal of mental symptoms is a cure of disease.    Certainly the psychophysical symptoms may often stand in the foreground  of the disease, and in that case it may be left to the special needs  whether we deal with them as psychical or as physical changes. Even the  patient may be made to see them in one or the other way in accordance  with his special needs. To tell him that his brain cells are in disorder  and that they can be cured will be the right thing for him who takes  only the introspective view of his suffering and is in despair because  his own will seems powerless to overcome those mental changes. For the  next patient, the opposite may be wiser. The belief that his brain is  ill may have induced him to give up effort of the will instead of  helping along by steady self-suggestion. He will be helped more if he  understands that his mind is working wrongly. But the full truth is that  both mind and body are in disorder; the function of the disturbed brain  cells accompanies the ineffective will, and to reenforce the will means  to bring into equilibrium again the disturbed brain cells. For the  psychotherapist the temptation of giving the attention to the mental  symptoms only is strong. The more firmly the physician sticks to the  standpoint of psychophysiology, the better he will see ailment and cure  in their right proportion.    This demand for the consideration of the whole personality, mind and  body, ought not to be influenced by the popular separation between  organic and functional diseases. If we call organic diseases of the mind  those in which the mental disturbance is the accompaniment of a brain  disturbance, and functional those in which no brain disturbance exists,  we leave entirely the ground of modern psychology. As soon as we  believe that the mind can be disturbed without a change in the functions  of the brain, we give away all that which has brought scientific order  into the study of psychological existence. Every mental disturbance  corresponds to a disorder in the brain's functions. But there cannot be  a change in the functions of the brain without a change in its  structure. Thus we must claim that all those so-called functional  disturbances like neurasthenia and hysteria, fixed ideas and obsessions,  phobias and dissociations of the personality, as well as the typical  insane states of the maniac or paranoiac have their basis in a  pathological change of the anatomical structure of the brain. This  postulate cannot be influenced by the fact that the microscope has been  unable to detect the character of most of these changes.    Of course all this does not exclude its being perfectly justifiable to  separate those diseases for which a definite destruction of the brain  parts can be detected, as in paralysis of the brain, from those where  that is impossible. We may also expect that those disturbances in the  brain which we cannot as yet make visible, may allow more easily an  organic repair and thus a restoration to the normal functions. Just as a  disjointed arm may be brought to function quickly again, a broken arm  slowly, an amputated arm never, each brain cell too may suffer lesions  which are reparable in different degrees. But it is evident that it  remains then an entirely empirical question whether the invisible damage  allows repair or not. We have no right to say that where the  destruction cannot be seen under the microscope there is no organic  change and the disturbance is therefore only a psychical one and can be  removed by mental means. All changes are physical and experience has to  decide whether they are accessible to psychological influences or not.  States like epilepsy may not allow any recognition of definite brain  destruction and are yet on the whole inaccessible to mental influence,  while many a brain disturbance with visible alterations, resulting  perhaps from anaemia or hyperaemia, may be caused to disappear. If on the  other hand we say that we can cure with psychotherapeutic means only the  functional brain diseases and define as functional simply those diseases  which can be cured by such means, we move, of course, in the most  obvious circle and yet just that is the too frequent fate of the  discussions in certain quarters.    Every psychical disturbance is organic inasmuch as it is based on a  molecular change which deranges the function. Some of these changes are  beyond restitution; some can be brought back to a well-working structure  by strictly physical agencies like drugs or electricity; others can be  repaired by physiological stimuli which reach directly the higher brain  cells through the sense organs and which we call psychical under one  aspect, but which certainly remain physiological influences from another  aspect. And these psychophysiological influences of the spoken words or  similar agencies are thus indeed for therapeutic effect entirely  cooerdinated with the douche and the bath and the electric current and  the opiate. It is a stimulation of certain brain cells, an inhibition of  certain others: a subtle apparatus which must be handled with careful  calculation of its microscopical causes and effects. That these words  from an entirely different point of view may mean a moral appeal and  have ethical value, point to moral and religious ideas and reenforce the  spiritual personality, lies entirely outside of the psychotherapeutic  calculation. As long as the curing of the patient is the aim, the faith  in God is not more valuable than the faith in the physician and the  moral appeal of no higher order than the influence through the galvanic  current. They come in question only as means to an end and they are  valuable only in so far as they reach the end. That they can be related  to an entirely different series of purposes, to the system of our moral  ideas, ought not to withdraw the attention of the psychotherapist from  his only aim, to cure the patient. The highest moral appeal may be even  a most unfit method of treatment and the religious emotion may just as  well do harm as good from the point of view of the physician.  Psychotherapy has suffered too much from the usual confusion of  standpoints.          V    SUGGESTION AND HYPNOTISM      Psychotherapy has now become for us the effort to repair the disturbed  equilibrium of human functions by influencing the mental life. It is  acknowledged on all sides that the most powerful of these influences is  that of suggestion. This is an influence which is most easily  misunderstood and which has most often become the starting point for  misleading theories. Before we enter into the study of the practical  effects of suggestion and the psychotherapeutic results, we must examine  this tool in the hand of the psychotherapist from a purely psychological  viewpoint. The patient may perhaps sometimes profit from suggestion the  more, the less he understands about its nature, but the physician will  always secure the better results, the more clearly he apprehends the  working of this subtle tool. Of course, that does not mean that any  psychology is able to explain the process of suggestion to a point where  all difficulties are removed, but at least the mysteries can be removed  and the effects can be linked with other well-known processes.    Let us be clear from the start that suggestion is certainly nothing  abnormal and exceptional, nothing which leads us away from our ordinary  life, nothing which brings us nearer to the great riddles of the  universe. There is no human life into which suggestion does not enter in  a hundred forms. Family life and education, law and business, public  life and politics, art and religion are carried by suggestion.
