But there's enough of that shed; as for wine,      I have learned to-night the price of the pure element:             350      Thrice have I drank of it, and thrice renewed,      With greater strength than the grape ever gave me,      My charge upon the rebels. Where's the soldier      Who gave me water in his helmet?[20]        _One of the Guards_.              Slain, Sire!      An arrow pierced his brain, while, scattering[aa]      The last drops from his helm, he stood in act      To place it on his brows.        _Sar._                   Slain! unrewarded!      And slain to serve my thirst: that's hard, poor slave!      Had he but lived, I would have gorged him with      Gold: all the gold of earth could ne'er repay                      360      The pleasure of that draught; for I was parched      As I am now.                           [_They bring water--he drinks_.                   I live again--from henceforth      The goblet I reserve for hours of love,      But war on water.        _Sal._            And that bandage, Sire,      Which girds your arm?        _Sar._                A scratch from brave Beleses.        _Myr._ Oh! he is wounded![ab]        _Sar._                        Not too much of that;      And yet it feels a little stiff and painful,      Now I am cooler.        _Myr._           You have bound it with----        _Sar._ The fillet of my diadem: the first time      That ornament was ever aught to me,                                370      Save an incumbrance.        _Myr._ (_to the Attendants_). Summon speedily      A leech of the most skilful: pray, retire:      I will unbind your wound and tend it.        _Sar._                                Do so,      For now it throbs sufficiently: but what      Know'st thou of wounds? yet wherefore do I ask?      Know'st thou, my brother, where I lighted on      This minion?        _Sal._       Herding with the other females,      Like frightened antelopes.        _Sar._                     No: like the dam      Of the young lion, femininely raging      (And femininely meaneth furiously,                                 380      Because all passions in excess are female,)      Against the hunter flying with her cub,      She urged on with her voice and gesture, and      Her floating hair and flashing eyes,[21] the soldiers,      In the pursuit.        _Sal._         Indeed!        _Sar._                You see, this night      Made warriors of more than me. I paused      To look upon her, and her kindled cheek;      Her large black eyes, that flashed through her long hair      As it streamed o'er her; her blue veins that rose      Along her most transparent brow; her nostril                       390      Dilated from its symmetry; her lips      Apart; her voice that clove through all the din,      As a lute pierceth through the cymbal's clash,      Jarred but not drowned by the loud brattling; her      Waved arms, more dazzling with their own born whiteness      Than the steel her hand held, which she caught up      From a dead soldier's grasp;--all these things made      Her seem unto the troops a prophetess      Of victory, or Victory herself,      Come down to hail us hers.[22]        _Sal._ (_aside_).           This is too much.                      400      Again the love-fit's on him, and all's lost,      Unless we turn his thoughts. (_Aloud_.) But pray thee, Sire,      Think of your wound--you said even now 'twas painful.        _Sar._ That's true, too; but I must not think of it.        _Sal._ I have looked to all things needful, and will now      Receive reports of progress made in such      Orders as I had given, and then return      To hear your further pleasure.        _Sar._                         Be it so.        _Sal._ (_in retiring_). Myrrha!        _Myr._                         Prince!        _Sal._         You have shown a soul to-night,      Which, were he not my sister's lord----But now                     410      I have no time: thou lovest the King?        _Myr._                               I love      Sardanapalus.        _Sal._         But wouldst have him King still?        _Myr._ I would not have him less than what he should be.        _Sal._ Well then, to have him King, and yours, and all      He should, or should not be; to have him _live_,      Let him not sink back into luxury.      You have more power upon his spirit than      Wisdom within these walls, or fierce rebellion      Raging without: look well that he relapse not.        _Myr._ There needed not the voice of Salemenes                     420      To urge me on to this: I will not fail.      All that a woman's weakness can----        _Sal._                               Is power      Omnipotent o'er such a heart as his:      Exert it wisely.                                    [_Exit_ SALEMENES.        _Sar._           Myrrha! what, at whispers      With my stern brother? I shall soon be jealous.        _Myr._ (_smiling_).      You have cause, Sire; for on the earth there breathes not      A man more worthy of a woman's love,      A soldier's trust, a subject's reverence,      A king's esteem--the whole world's admiration!        _Sar._ Praise him, but not so warmly. I must not                   430      Hear those sweet lips grow eloquent in aught      That throws me into shade; yet you speak truth.        _Myr._ And now retire, to have your wound looked to,      Pray lean on me.        _Sar._          Yes, love! but not from pain.                                                            [_Exeunt omnes_.                                           ACT IV.                SCENE I.--SARDANAPALUS _discovered sleeping upon a              Couch, and occasionally disturbed in his slumbers,                           with_ MYRRHA _watching_.        _Myr._ (_sola, gazing_).      I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be,      Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him?      No, he seems calmer. Oh, thou God of Quiet!      Whose reign is o'er sealed eyelids and soft dreams,      Or deep, deep sleep, so as to be unfathomed,      Look like thy brother, Death,[23]--so still, so stirless--      For then we are happiest, as it may be, we      Are happiest of all within the realm      Of thy stern, silent, and unwakening Twin.      Again he moves--again the play of pain                              10      Shoots o'er his features, as the sudden gust      Crisps the reluctant lake that lay so calm[ac]      Beneath the mountain shadow; or the blast      Ruffles the autumn leaves, that drooping cling      Faintly and motionless to their loved boughs.      I must awake him--yet not yet; who knows      From what I rouse him? It seems pain; but if      I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever      Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of      His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake            20      Me more to see than him to suffer. No:      Let Nature use her own maternal means,      And I await to second, not disturb her.        _Sar._ (_awakening_).      Not so--although he multiplied the stars,      And gave them to me as a realm to share      From you and with you! I would not so purchase      The empire of Eternity. Hence--hence--      Old Hunter of the earliest brutes! and ye,[ad]      Who hunted fellow-creatures as if brutes!      Once bloody mortals--and now bloodier idols,                        30      If your priests lie not! And thou, ghastly Beldame!      Dripping with dusky gore, and trampling on      The carcasses of Inde--away! away!      Where am I? Where the spectres? Where--No--that      Is no false phantom: I should know it 'midst      All that the dead dare gloomily raise up      From their black gulf to daunt the living. Myrrha!        _Myr._ Alas! thou art pale, and on thy brow the drops      Gather like night dew. My beloved, hush--      Calm thee. Thy speech seems of another world,                       40      And thou art lord of this. Be of good cheer;      All will go well.        _Sar._            Thy _hand_--so--'tis thy hand;      'Tis flesh; grasp--clasp--yet closer, till I feel      Myself that which I was.        _Myr._                   At least know me      For what I am, and ever must be--thine.        _Sar._ I know it now. I know this life again.      Ah, Myrrha! I have been where we shall be.        _Myr._ My lord!        _Sar._          I've been i' the grave--where worms are lords      And kings are----But I did not deem it so;      I thought 'twas nothing.        _Myr._                   So it is; except                           50      Unto the timid, who anticipate      That which may never be.        _Sar._                   Oh, Myrrha! if      Sleep shows such things, what may not Death disclose?        _Myr._ I know no evil Death can show, which Life      Has not already shown to those who live      Embodied longest. If there be indeed      A shore where Mind survives, 'twill be as Mind      All unincorporate: or if there flits      A shadow of this cumbrous clog of clay.      Which stalks, methinks, between our souls and heaven,               60      And fetters us to earth--at least the phantom,      Whate'er it have to fear, will not fear Death.        _Sar._ I fear it not; but I have felt--have seen--      A legion of the dead.        _Myr._                And so have I.      The dust we tread upon was once alive,      And wretched. But proceed: what hast thou seen?      Speak it, 'twill lighten thy dimmed mind.        _Sar._                                    Methought----        _Myr._ Yet pause, thou art tired--in pain--exhausted; all      Which can impair both strength and spirit: seek      Rather to sleep again.        _Sar._                 Not now--I would not                       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#14)"],[1,"faces painted, beat upon drums, while two  others, with caps of green feathers, blew their trumpets of black wood  ingeniously carved.  There were six others in caps of white feathers,  who appeared to be guards to the cacique.    Having arrived alongside the Admiral's ship, he came on board with all  his train.  He wore on his head a band of small green stones, joined in  front by a large jewel of gold; two plates of gold were suspended to his  ears; to a necklace of white beads hung a large metal plate, resembling  gold, in the form of a _fleur de lys_, while a girdle of variegated  stones completed his costume; though his wife and daughters, with the  exception of girdles, to which were suspended tablets of coloured  stones, were unadorned.    The chief, warmly greeting the Admiral, told him that his object in  coming was to accompany him to Spain, to do homage to the King and  Queen.  Columbus, knowing the dangers that the simple savage and his  people would be exposed to, was touched with compassion, and determined  not to take them from their native land.  He therefore told him that as  he had many places to visit, he could not take him then, but would at  some future time fulfil his desire.  Reluctantly the cacique and his  family re-embarked in his canoe and returned to the shore, while the  ships continued their cruise.    Columbus now stood across to Hispaniola.  On sending a boat on shore  near a large village, the inhabitants issued forth with bows and arrows,  while others came provided with cords to bind their expected prisoners.  These were the natives of the eastern province.  Their hostility,  however, was only in appearance, for directly the crew landed they threw  aside their arms, and readily brought provisions, asking for the  Admiral, whose fame had spread over the whole island.  Shortly after  this he was weatherbound for several days in a harbour formed by an  island close to the coast.    When once free, and in seas now well known, being relieved from all  anxiety and the excitement which had so long existed, his mind and body  sank exhausted by his almost superhuman exertions.  He was struck by a  sudden malady, which deprived him of his memory, sight, and all his  faculties, and he fell into a deep lethargy, resembling death itself.  In that state he was borne back to Isabella.  Soon after arriving there  he recovered consciousness, and his heart was cheered by seeing his  much-loved brother Bartholomew, from whom he had been separated many  years, standing over him.    Bartholomew had in the meantime made a voyage to Africa, and visited  Henry the Seventh of England and Charles the Eighth of France, and on  his arrival in Spain had been sent out in command of three ships,  freighted with supplies for the colony.    He had arrived just after his brother had sailed, and since had been  waiting for his return.  On his recovery, aided by his two excellent  brothers, Bartholomew and Diego, Columbus took the most energetic steps  for the benefit of the colony.  A turbulent spirit existed among the  settlers, and many of the natives had been driven into hostility.  By an  inexcusable stratagem of Ojeda, one of the most powerful caciques,  Caonabo was captured.  Several others were afterwards taken prisoners.  The Spaniards, however, quarrelled among themselves, and neglecting the  excellent regulations of Columbus, set his authority at defiance, while  some of those he had most trusted openly rebelled.  Margarite, one of  the principal officers, and the cunning friar Boyle, with other  worthless men, sent home insidious reports regarding his administration  of the government.  He, aware of the accusations against him, forwarded  counter reports, and, in the meantime, endeavoured to obtain all the  gold to be procured to satisfy the cupidity of Ferdinand.  He built  several fortresses, both in the gold region and other parts of the  country, and in a short time the whole of the inhabitants were reduced  to a helpless state of slavery, for, though he intended that they should  be treated with justice and kindly, the heartless and greedy Spaniards  thought only how they could obtain the largest amount of profit from  their labours.    In spite of all his representations, his enemies so contrived to poison  the mind of Ferdinand, that a commissioner, Juan Aguado, armed with  supreme authority, was sent out to investigate the behaviour of  Columbus, and to administer the government.    The Admiral received him with calmness and courtesy, and gave him no  opportunity of creating a quarrel.  All the rebels and dissatisfied  spirits, however, thronged round Aguado and brought their accusations  against Columbus, who, finding that Aguado was about to return to Spain,  resolved likewise to go there, in order to defend himself.    As Aguado was about to sail, a fearful hurricane burst over the island  and destroyed his four ships.  Columbus on this ordered that the _Nina_,  which was in a shattered and leaky condition, should be prepared, and  another vessel constructed out of the wrecks.    At this juncture a young Spaniard, who, in consequence of wounding a  man, had fled from the settlement and concealed himself among the  natives near the mountains, where he married, had, by the aid of his  wife, discovered a rich gold region.    Knowing that he should be pardoned, he returned and reported the  discovery to Columbus, who, highly elated, fully believed that the mines  were those of the ancient Ophir.    The _Santa Cruz_, the new caravel, being finished and the _Nina_  repaired, Columbus appointed his brother, Don Bartholomew, as  Adelantado, to govern the island, and going on board, set sail on the  12th of March, 1496.  Aguado went on board the other vessel, and between  the two were two hundred and twenty-five passengers, all those who  wished to return to the old country, as well as thirty Indians, with the  cacique Caonabo, one of his brothers, and a nephew.  Even captivity  could not crush the spirit of the haughty chief till he fell ill, and  died before the termination of the voyage.    After meeting with baffling winds for a long time, on the 6th of April  Columbus found himself still in the neighbourhood of the Carib Islands,  his crew sickly and his provisions diminishing.  He bore away,  therefore, in search of supplies, and after touching at Maregalante,  made sail for Guadaloupe.  Here a boat going ashore to obtain wood and  water, a large number of females, decorated with tufts of feathers and  armed with bows and arrows, as if to defend their shores, were seen  issuing from the forest.  The natives on board having explained to these  Amazonian dames that the object of the Spaniards was barter, they  referred them to their husbands, who, they said, were in a different  part of the island.    As the boats pulled along the beach numbers of natives approached,  shouting and yelling, and brandishing their weapons, and discharging  flights of arrows.    A few shots from the firearms of the Spaniards drove them off.  The boat  when landing met with no further opposition, and, contrary to the  injunctions of the Admiral, they plundered and destroyed the native  huts.  Honey and wax were found in the houses, and hatchets made of hard  and heavy stone.  One of the seamen declared that he found a human arm  roasting, but this statement was probably made to excuse himself and his  companions for the wanton mischief they had committed.    While some of the men were obtaining wood and water, Columbus dispatched  a strongly-armed party of forty into the interior.  Here they  encountered a number of women of large and powerful form, their long  hair flowing loose upon their shoulders, and their heads decorated with  plumes of various colours.  Ten women and three boys were brought back.  Among the former was a woman of great strength and of proud spirit, who  endeavoured to escape, but being pursued by a Spaniard, was overtaken  while attempting to strangle him, and was captured.    After they were brought on board Columbus ordered them to be restored to  the island, but the chieftainess, whose heart had been touched by the  misfortunes of Caonabo, insisted on remaining to comfort him, and was  thus carried captive to Spain.    Guadaloupe was left on the 20th of April, but a whole month was spent  beating against contrary winds and currents, so that water and  provisions began to fail, and the people were put upon short allowance.  So reduced were they at last that some of the Spaniards proposed, as an  expedient, that they should kill and eat their Indian prisoners.  Others  suggested that they should throw them into the sea.    Columbus had to exert all his authority to prevent this atrocious act.  He urged them to wait with patience, and assured them that in a short  time they would see Cape Saint Vincent.    Many scoffed, declaring that they were on a different part of the coast,  but on the 10th he ordered that sail should be taken in at night, and on  the next morning they were in sight of the very land he had predicted.    After a dreary voyage of three months, on the 11th of June the vessels  anchored in the Bay of Cadiz.  He found three caravels on the point of  sailing, to carry provisions to the colony.  Nearly a year had passed  without relief of any kind having been sent out, as four vessels which  had sailed in January had been lost.  By this squadron he wrote to his  brother, the Adelantado, urging him to bring the island into a peaceful  and productive state, and to send to Spain all Indians who should injure  any of the colonists.    Columbus was honourably treated by the sovereigns, although the mind of  Ferdinand was evidently poisoned by the representations of his enemies.  Notwithstanding the cruel opposition of his foes, the great navigator,  refusing to take the repose his health so much required, bent on  prosecuting his discoveries, employed all his energies to obtain"]]]
