When we wish to learn the great deeds of past ages, and of mighty men  long dead, we open a book and read. When we wish to leave to the  generations who will come long after us a record of the things that were  done by ourselves or in our own times, we take pen, ink and paper, and  write a book. What we have written is then printed, published in several  hundreds--or thousands--of copies, as the case may be, and quickly finds  its way to all the countries of the world inhabited by people who are  trained from childhood to thought and study. So that we have the  satisfaction of knowing that the information which we have labored to  preserve will be obtainable any number of years or centuries after we  shall have ceased to exist, at no greater trouble than procuring the  book from the shelves of a bookstore, a public or a private library. It  is all very simple. And there is not a small child who does not  perfectly know a book by its looks, and even has not a pretty correct  idea of how a book is made and what it is good for.    2. But books are not always of the shape and material so familiar to us.  Metal, stone, brick, walls and pillars, nay, the very rocks of nature's  own making, can be books, conveying information as plainly as our  volumes of paper sheets covered with written or printed lines. It only  needs to know how to read them, and the necessary knowledge and skill  may be acquired by processes as simple as the art of ordinary reading  and writing, though at the cost of a somewhat greater amount of time and  pains.    3. There are two natural cravings, which assert themselves strongly in  every mind not entirely absorbed by the daily work for bread and by the  anxious care how to procure that work: these are the wish, on the one  hand, to learn how the people who came before us lived and what they  did, on the other--to transmit our own names and the memory of our deeds  to those who will come after us. We are not content with our present  life; we want to stretch it both backward and forward--to live both in  the past and the future, as it were. This curiosity and this ambition  are but parts of the longing for immortality which was never absent from  any human soul. In our own age they are satisfied mainly by books;  indeed they were originally the principal causes why books began to be  made at all. And how easy to satisfy these cravings in our time, when  writing materials have become as common as food and far cheaper, and  reading may be had for nothing or next to nothing! For, a very few  dollars will supply a writer with as much paper as he can possibly use  up in a year, while the public libraries, the circulating and college  libraries and the reading-rooms make study a matter more of love and  perseverance than of money.    4. Yet if the papermill and the printing press were the only material  aid to our researches into the past, these researches would stop  short very soon, seeing that printing was invented in Europe scarce  four hundred years ago, and paper has not been manufactured for more  than six hundred years at the outside. True, other materials have  been used to write on before paper: bark of trees, skins of  animals--(parchment)--cunningly worked fibres of plants--(papyrus,  byblos)--even wooden tablets covered with a thin layer of wax, on  which characters were engraved with a pointed instrument or  \"style,\"--and these contrivances have preserved for us records which  reach back many hundreds of years beyond the introduction of paper.  But our curiosity, when once aroused, is insatiable, and an area of  some twenty, or thirty, or forty centuries seems to it but a narrow  field. Looking back as far as that--and no kind of manuscript  information takes us much further--we behold the world wondrously  like what it is now. With some differences in garb, in manners, and a  much greater one in the range of knowledge, we find men living very  nearly as we do and enacting very nearly the same scenes: nations  live in families clustered within cities, are governed by laws, or  ruled by monarchs, carry on commerce and wars, extend their limits by  conquest, excel in all sorts of useful and ornamental arts. Only we  notice that larger regions are unknown, vaster portions of the  earth, with their populations, are unexplored, than in our days. The  conclusion is clearly forced on us, that so complicated and perfect  an organization of public and private life, a condition of society  implying so many discoveries and so long a practice in thought and  handicraft, could not have been an early stage of existence. Long  vistas are dimly visible into a past far vaster than the span as yet  laid open to our view, and we long to pierce the tantalizing gloom.  There, in that gloom, lurk the beginnings of the races whose high  achievements we admire, emulate, and in many ways surpass; there, if  we could but send a ray of light into the darkness of ages, we must  find the solution of numberless questions which suggest themselves as  we go: Whence come those races? What was the earlier history of other  races with which we find them contending, treating, trading? When did  they learn their arts, their songs, their forms of worship? But here  our faithful guide, manuscript literature, forsakes us; we enter on a  period when none of the ancient substitutes for paper were yet  invented. But then, there were the stones. _They_ did not need to be  invented--only hewn and smoothed for the chisel.    5. Fortunately for us, men, twenty-five, and forty, and fifty centuries  ago, were actuated by the same feelings, the same aspirations as they  are now, and of these aspirations, the passionate wish of perpetuating  their names and the memory of their deeds has always been one of the  most powerful. This wish they connected with and made subservient to  the two things which were great and holy in their eyes: their religion  and the power of their kings. So they built, in brick and stone, at an  almost incalculable expense of time, human labor and human life, palaces  and temples. On these huge piles they lavished treasures untold, as also  all the resources of their invention and their skill in art and  ornament; they looked on them with exulting pride, not only because they  thought them, by their vastness and gorgeousness, fit places for public  worship and dwellings worthy of their kings, but because these  constructions, in their towering grandeur, their massive solidity, bid  fair to defy time and outlast the nations which raised them, and which  thus felt assured of leaving behind them traces of their existence,  memorials of their greatness. That a few defaced, dismantled, moss-grown  or sand-choked fragments of these mighty buildings would one day be the  _only_ trace, the sole memorial of a rule and of nations that would then  have past away forever, even into nothingness and oblivion, scarcely was  anticipated by the haughty conquerors who filled those halls with their  despotic presence, and entered those consecrated gates in the pomp of  triumph to render thanks for bloody victories and warlike exploits which  elated their souls in pride till they felt themselves half divine.  Nothing doubting but that those walls, those pillars, those gateways  would stand down to the latest ages, they confided to them that which  was most precious to their ambition, the record of their deeds, the  praises of their names, thus using those stony surfaces as so many  blank pages, which they covered with row after row of wondrous  characters, carefully engraved or chiselled, and even with painted or  sculptured representations of their own persons and of the scenes, in  war or peace, in which they had been leaders and actors.    6. Thus it is that on all the points of the globe where sometime great  and flourishing nations have held their place, then yielded to other  nations or to absolute devastation--in Egypt, in India, in Persia, in  the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates, in the sandy, now desert plains  of Syria, in the once more populous haunts of ancient Rome and  Greece--the traveller meets clusters of great ruins, lofty still in  their utter abandonment, with a strange, stern beauty hovering around  their weather-beaten, gigantic shafts and cornices, wrapt in the  pathetic silence of desolation, and yet not dumb--for their pictured  faces eloquently proclaim the tale of buoyant life and action entrusted  to them many thousands of years ago. Sometimes, it is a natural rock,  cut and smoothed down at a height sufficient to protect it from the  wantonly destructive hand of scoffing invaders, on which a king of a  deeper turn of thought, more mindful than others of the law which dooms  all the works of men to decay, has caused a relation of the principal  events of his reign to be engraved in those curious characters which  have for centuries been a puzzle and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#14)"],[1,"children thoroughly enjoy the wild, free life,  apparently suffering no ill effects from the rigours of the climate.    A Lapp baby starts life in a very queer way. Until it is able to  walk it is kept in what is called a _komse_, a kind of cradle made  of strips of wood covered with leather, and just large enough to take  the baby. The little creature is rolled up in sheepskin and put into  the cradle, which is then stuffed with moss, and the leather covering  laced securely all around, so that only the baby's face is seen. To  protect its head the _komse_ is provided with a wooden hood, like most  cradles, and there is generally a shawl, which can be thrown over  the whole thing in severe weather; in fact, when the baby has been  properly done up in its _komse_, it might go by parcel post without  coming to much harm. It is a very excellent arrangement, because the  family is incessantly moving about, and the mothers have their work  to do, so cannot always be bothering about their babies. A thong of  leather stretches from head to foot of the _komse_, which the mother  can thus sling on her shoulder when going about, and by this thong  the baby can be hung up to a tent-pole or to the branch of a tree if  its mother is busy. But as often as not the _komses_ are just stuck  up on end in the snow or against a rock while work is going on.    As soon as the child can walk and has finished its cradle existence, it  is dressed in clothes similar to those of his or her father or mother,  and looks most quaint. And the life which these children lead is devoid  of much amusement. From the beginning they are helping to pack up and  move the tent, and to look after the reindeer; they are nothing more  than little old men and women; their toys are miniatures, or models,  of such things as they will have to use later in life--lassoes,  snowshoes, sleighs--and their games are restricted to learning the use  of the same. They are treated by their parents more or less as if they  were grown up, and allowed to do much as they please. Consequently,  they become self-willed, and have little respect for their elders.    After all, the mode of life of the Lapps does not differ very  greatly from that of our own gipsies, though of the two the Lapps  are certainly the better people. The wandering spirit is inherent  in both, but a portion of each sooner or later shakes it off, and  leads a more settled life. Some there are, however, who will never  be anything but wanderers, so long as there remains a free country  wherein they are at liberty to roam.    Let us now see the kind of place which the Mountain Lapp calls  \"home.\" It cannot be anything very elaborate or bulky, as it has to be  packed up and moved about nearly every day, and it has to be carried  on the backs of the reindeer in summer, or drawn by them in sleighs  in the winter. So it is nothing more than a most unconventional form  of tent, not altogether unlike the wigwam of the Red Indian, or the  dwelling of many other nomadic people. A few long poles are stuck up  on a circle, with their ends fastened together to form a sort of cone,  and over this framework is stretched a covering of coarse woollen  material. At one side there is a loose flap, forming a door, and the  whole of the top part of the tent round about the ends of the poles  is left open, to admit light and to allow the smoke from the fire to  issue forth. The diameter of the tent is about twelve or fifteen feet,  and the height in the centre eight or ten feet. This is the kitchen,  larder, store-room, drawing-room, dining-room, and bedroom of the  family--men, women, boys, girls, babies, dogs and all.    A few branches of trees are spread on the ground, and in the middle,  immediately under the opening in the roof, is the fire, which is  kept alight day and night. Around it the inmates sit on the ground  by day, and sleep by night. There is no furniture of any kind, and  only a few cooking-pots, with some wooden bowls, and spoons of wood  or of horn. Beds and blankets and suchlike luxuries are also absent,  so undressing, dressing, washing, and absurdities of that kind are  not indulged in. When the time has come to go to sleep, those who  are in the tent just roll themselves close up to the fire, and sleep  quite comfortably in the clothes which they probably have not taken  off for a year or two. The whole family is not likely to be in the  tent at the same time; some members of it must always be looking  after the reindeer, as the herd can never be left to its own devices;  consequently, there is generally plenty of room.    Meals are free-and-easy affairs; there is no dinner-bell and no  fixed time for eating. But food is always ready, hanging in a pot  over the fire; and when anyone feels inclined to eat, the hand is  plunged into the pot, and a piece of meat pulled out and devoured. In  addition to reindeer-meat--of which the Lapps consume a great deal--the  food consists of cheese, and sometimes a kind of porridge; while for  drink they have water, melted snow, reindeer-milk, and, on occasions,  coffee. The latter they are very fond of, but few families can afford  to drink it often; so also with spirits, which, however, they only  manage to obtain in the towns.    Thus live the Mountain Lapps year in year out. To-day a family is in  one place, to-morrow a dozen miles away; now and again other families  are met with, and received hospitably; but for the most part the  family and its herd keep to themselves, since to do otherwise might  lead to difficulties about grazing. The rain floods their tent; the  snow buries it; the wind blows it down; yet they survive, and glory  in their free life.    The Sea Lapps, though much more numerous than their brethren of the  mountains, are not so interesting. They live by the coast in huts built  of wood or of sods, and obtain a livelihood by fishing. The River  Lapps, on the other hand, are both herdsmen and fishermen. Residing  in small settlements on the banks of the rivers, they keep reindeer  as well as a few cows and sheep, and they do a little in the way  of farming the land round the settlement. Many of them are even  intellectual, and the advantages of having their children properly  educated in the schools are gradually becoming appreciated.            CHAPTER XVI    WINTER IN CHRISTIANIA      Cold it is, of course--bitterly cold, and always freezing hard; but  it is a dry cold, and you hardly notice it. The streets are all one  sheet of frozen snow, and great care is taken to keep them in good  repair, gangs of road-menders being always at hand to fill up ruts  by the simple process of picking up the hard snow of the roadway and  then sprinkling a little water on the top, which at once produces a  solid surface. No wheeled traffic is now to be seen; everything is on  runners, from the carriage of the King to the doll's perambulator. One  no longer hears the rumble of the _carrioles_ and _stolkjaerres_ over  the rough flags, and the silence is broken only by the jingling of  the sleigh-bells.    It is a strange sight indeed, this winter city, with its fur-clad  men and women, and snow-covered houses and gardens, its keen, crisp  air and pale blue sky. What a change from the fogs and dampness of  our English climate!    Christiania is gay at this time of year, for it is the \"season.\" The  members of the Storthing, with their wives and families, are in town  for the session, and all sorts of gaieties are in progress. But all  those Norwegians who have leisure to enjoy themselves turn their  attentions to the real pleasures of winter--sleighing, ski-ing,  tobogganing, and skating. The boys and girls are thoroughly  happy. Directly school is over away they go, with their skates,  snowshoes, or toboggans, to have a right good time in their different  playgrounds. The hill on which the palace stands is given up to these  little revellers, and in the evenings dozens of them of all ages may  be seen descending the slopes face downwards on their _kjaelker_, or  racing through the trees with their long ski on their feet. The public  gardens also are flooded to form a rink for the sole use of the infant  skaters, and, judging by their rosy cheeks, the outdoor exercise in  the cold, dry air makes them as healthy as any children in the world.    But grown-up people consider skating feeble sport in comparison with  ski-ing, which may be called the national sport of Norway. Not so  many years ago it was restricted to that country; but now the sport  has become a favourite one in Sweden, Switzerland, and in other  parts of Europe where the snow lies deep. Yet, to see perfection  in the art, one must go to Norway--the real home of the great long  wooden snowshoe. From earliest youth the Norwegians of both sexes  are accustomed to go about the country in the long winter months on  these strange contrivances, for without them it would be absolutely  impossible to move off the roads. Children are taught in the schools to  use them; soldiers wear them at winter drill and manoeuvres; farmers,  milkmaids, cowboys, all may be seen daily in the country parts going  from place to place on them, and so keen are the young rustic lads  on becoming proficient ski-runners that all over Norway are to be  found ski clubs, formed for the purpose of encouraging snowshoeing  as a pastime, and for sending competitors to the great annual meeting  at Christiania.    These snowshoe competitions are most interesting and exciting; and the  pluck, endurance, and daring which they bring out are remarkable. They  take place on the hills just outside Christiania, and are attended by  every man, woman, and child who can reach the spot. On the first day is  held the long-distance race, and on the second the jumping competition,  only winners in the former being allowed to enter for the latter.    Every English boy knows what it is to take part in a cross-country  run of half a dozen miles."]]]
