Oh, how badly I felt! Mother and I were  poor, and had to work hard, but we had feelings just like other  people, and to be insulted like that before Trenham Manning! I just  burst out crying then and there, and ran away and hid. It was very  silly of me, but I couldn't help it. That stings me yet. If I was ever  to get a chance to pay Lou Carroll out for that, I'd take it without  any compunction.\"    \"Oh, but that is unchristian!\" protested Mrs. Stapp feebly.    \"Perhaps so, but it's the way I feel. Old Parson Jones used to say  that people were marbled good and bad pretty even, but that in  everybody there were one or two streaks just pure wicked. I guess Lou  Carroll is my wicked streak. I haven't seen or heard of her for  years--ever since she married that worthless Dency Baxter and went  away. She may be dead for all I know. I don't expect ever to have a  chance to pay her out. But mark what I say, Theodosia, if I ever have,  I will.\"    Mrs. March snipped off her thread, as if she challenged the world.  Mrs. Stapp felt uncomfortable over the unusual display of feeling she  had evoked, and hastened to change the subject.    In three weeks' time Mrs. March was established in her new home, and  the \"old Carroll house\" blossomed out into renewed splendour.  Theodosia Stapp, who had dropped in to see it, was in a rapture of  admiration.    \"You have a lovely home now, Anna. I used to think it fine enough in  the Carrolls' time, but it wasn't as grand as this. And that reminds  me, I have something to tell you, but I don't want you to get as  excited as you did the last time I mentioned her name. You remember  the last day I was to see you we were talking of Lou Carroll? Well,  next day I was downtown in a store, and who should sail in but Mrs.  Joel Kent, from Oriental. You know Mrs. Joel--Sarah Chapple that was?  She and her man keep a little hotel up at Oriental. They're not very  well off. She is a cousin of old Mrs. Carroll, but, lawful heart, the  Carrolls didn't used to make much of the relationship! Well, Mrs. Joel  and I had a chat. She told me all her troubles--she always has lots of  them. Sarah was always of a grumbling turn, and she had a brand-new  stock of them this time. What do you think, Anna March? Lou  Carroll--or Mrs. Baxter, I suppose I should say--is up there at Joel  Kent's at Oriental, dying of consumption; leastwise, Mrs. Joel says  she is.\"    \"Lou Carroll dying at Oriental!\" cried Mrs. March.    \"Yes. She came there from goodness knows where, about a month  ago--might as well have dropped from the clouds, Mrs. Joel says, for  all she expected of it. Her husband is dead, and I guess he led her a  life of it when he was alive, and she's as poor as second skimmings.  She was aiming to come here, Mrs. Joel says, but when she got to  Oriental she wasn't fit to stir a step further, and the Kents had to  keep her. I gather from what Mrs. Joel said that she's rather touched  in her mind too, and has an awful hankering to get home here--to this  very house. She appears to have the idea that it is hers, and all  just the same as it used to be. I guess she is a sight of trouble, and  Mrs. Joel ain't the woman to like that. But there! She has to work  most awful hard, and I suppose a sick person doesn't come handy in a  hotel. I guess you've got your revenge, Anna, without lifting a finger  to get it. Think of Lou Carroll coming to that!\"    The next day was cold and raw. The ragged, bare trees in the old  Carroll grounds shook and writhed in the gusts of wind. Now and then a  drifting scud of rain dashed across the windows. Mrs. March looked out  with a shiver, and turned thankfully to her own cosy fireside again.    Presently she thought she heard a low knock at the front door, and  went to see. As she opened it a savage swirl of damp wind rushed in,  and the shrinking figure leaning against one of the fluted columns of  the Grecian porch seemed to cower before its fury. It was a woman who  stood there, a woman whose emaciated face wore a piteous expression,  as she lifted it to Mrs. March.    \"You don't know me, of course,\" she said, with a feeble attempt at  dignity. \"I am Mrs. Baxter. I--I used to live here long ago. I thought  I'd walk over today and see my old home.\"    A fit of coughing interrupted her words, and she trembled like a leaf.    \"Gracious me!\" exclaimed Mrs. March blankly. \"You don't mean to tell  me that you have walked over from Oriental today--and you a sick  woman! For pity's sake, come in, quick. And if you're not wet to the  skin!\"    She fairly pulled her visitor into the hall, and led her to the  sitting-room.    \"Sit down. Take this big easy-chair right up to the fire--so. Let me  take your bonnet and shawl. I must run right out to tell Hannah to get  you a hot drink.\"    \"You are very kind,\" whispered the other. \"I don't know you, but you  look like a woman I used to know when I was a girl. She was a Mrs.  Bennett, and she had a daughter, Anna. Do you know what became of her?  I forget. I forget everything now.\"    \"My name is March,\" said Mrs. March briefly, ignoring the question. \"I  don't suppose you ever heard it before.\"    She wrapped her own warm shawl about the other woman's thin shoulders.  Then she hastened to the kitchen and soon returned, carrying a tray of  food and a steaming hot drink. She wheeled a small table up to her  visitor's side and said, very kindly,    \"Now, take a bite, my dear, and this raspberry vinegar will warm you  right up. It is a dreadful day for you to be out. Why on earth didn't  Joel Kent drive you over?\"    \"They didn't know I was coming,\" whispered Mrs. Baxter anxiously.  \"I--I ran away. Sarah wouldn't have let me come if she had known. But  I wanted to come so much. It is so nice to be home again.\"    Mrs. March watched her guest as she ate and drank. It was plain enough  that her mind, or rather her memory, was affected. She did not  realize that this was no longer her home. At moments she seemed to  fancy herself back in the past again. Once or twice she called Mrs.  March \"Mother.\"    Presently a sharp knock was heard at the hall door. Mrs. March excused  herself and went out. In the porch stood Theodosia Stapp and a woman  whom Mrs. March did not at first glance recognize--a tall,  aggressive-looking person, whose sharp black eyes darted in past Mrs.  March and searched every corner of the hall before anyone had time to  speak.    \"Lawful heart!\" puffed Mrs. Stapp, as she stepped in out of the biting  wind. \"I'm right out of breath. Mrs. March, allow me to introduce Mrs.  Kent. We're looking for Mrs. Baxter. She has run away, and we thought  perhaps she came here. Did she?\"    \"She is in my sitting-room now,\" said Mrs. March quietly.    \"Didn't I say so?\" demanded Mrs. Kent, turning to Mrs. Stapp. She  spoke in a sharp, high-pitched tone that grated on Mrs. March's  nerves. \"Doesn't she beat all! She slipped away this morning when I  was busy in the kitchen. And to think of her walking six miles over  here in this wind! I dunno how she did it. I don't believe she's half  as sick as she pretends. Well, I've got my wagon out here, Mrs. March,  and I'll be much obliged if you'll tell her I'm here to take her home.  I s'pose we'll have a fearful scene.\"    \"I don't see that there is any call for a scene,\" said Mrs. March  firmly. \"The poor woman has just got here, and she thinks she has got  home. She might as well think so if it is of any comfort to her. You'd  better leave her here.\"    Theodosia gave a stifled gasp of amazement, but Mrs. March went  serenely on.    \"I'll take care of the poor soul as long as she needs it--and that  will not be very long in my opinion, for if ever I saw death in a  woman's face, it is looking out of hers. I've plenty of time to look  after her and make her comfortable.\"    Mrs. Joel Kent was voluble in her thanks. It was evident that she was  delighted to get the sick woman off her hands. Mrs. March cut her  short with an invitation to stay to tea, but Mrs. Kent declined.    \"I've got to hurry home straight off and get the men's suppers. Such a  scamper to have over that woman! I'm sure I'm thankful you're willing  to let her stay, for she'd never be contented anywhere else. I'll send  over what few things she has tomorrow.\"    When Mrs. Kent had gone, Mrs. March and Mrs. Stapp looked at each  other.    \"And so this is your revenge, Anna March?\" said the latter solemnly.  \"Do you remember what you said to me about her?\"    \"Yes, I do, Theodosia, and I thought I meant every word of it. But I  guess my wicked streak ran out just when I needed it to depend on.  Besides, you see, I've thought of Lou Carroll all these years as she  was when I knew her--handsome and saucy and proud. But that poor  creature in there isn't any more like the Lou Carroll I knew than you  are--not a mite. The old Lou Carroll is dead already, and my spite is  dead with her. Will you come in and see her?\"    \"Well, no, not just now. She wouldn't know me, and Mrs. Joel says  strangers kind of excite her--a pretty bad place the hotel would be  for her at that rate, I should think. I must go and tell Peter about  it, and I'll send up some of my black currant jam for her.\"    When Mrs. Stapp had gone, Mrs. March went back to her guest. Lou  Baxter had fallen asleep with her head pillowed on the soft plush back  of her chair. Mrs. March looked at the hollow, hectic cheeks and the  changed, wasted features, and her bright brown eyes softened with  tears.    \"Poor Lou,\" she said softly, as she brushed a loose lock of grey hair  back from the sleeping woman's brow.

Dorinda had been only ten when her  Aunt Mary--on the Carter side--had written to Mrs. Page, asking her to  let Dorinda come to her for the winter.    Mrs. Page, albeit she was poor--nobody but herself knew how poor--and  a widow with five children besides Dorinda, hesitated at first. She  was afraid, with good reason, that the winter might stretch into other  seasons; but Mary had lost her own only little girl in the summer, and  Mrs. Page shuddered at the thought of what her loneliness must be. So,  to comfort her, Mrs. Page had let Dorinda go, stipulating that she  must come home in the spring. In the spring, when Dorinda's bed of  violets was growing purple under the lilac bush, Aunt Mary wrote  again. Dorinda was contented and happy, she said. Would not Emily let  her stay for the summer? Mrs. Page cried bitterly over that letter and  took sad counsel with herself. To let Dorinda stay with her aunt for  the summer really meant, she knew, to let her stay altogether. Mrs.  Page was finding it harder and harder to get along; there was so  little and the children needed so much; Dorinda would have a good home  with her Aunt Mary if she could only prevail on her rebellious mother  heart to give her up. In the end she agreed to let Dorinda stay for  the summer--and Dorinda had never been home since.    But now Dorinda had come back to the little white house on the hill at  Willowdale, set back from the road in a smother of apple trees and  vines. Aunt Mary had died very suddenly and her only son, Dorinda's  cousin, had gone to Japan. There was nothing for Dorinda to do save  to come home, to enter again into her old unfilled place in her  mother's heart, and win a new place in the hearts of the brothers and  sisters who barely remembered her at all. Leicester had been nine and  Jean seven when Dorinda went away; now they were respectively fourteen  and twelve.    At first they were a little shy with this big, practically brand-new  sister, but this soon wore off. Nobody could be shy long with Dorinda;  nobody could help liking her. She was so brisk and jolly and  sympathetic--a real Page, so everybody said--while the brothers and  sisters were Carter to their marrow; Carters with fair hair and blue  eyes, and small, fine, wistful features; but Dorinda had merry black  eyes, plump, dusky-red cheeks, and a long braid of glossy dark hair,  which was perpetually being twitched from one shoulder to another as  Dorinda whisked about the house on domestic duties intent.    In a week Dorinda felt herself one of the family again, with all the  cares and responsibilities thereof resting on her strong young  shoulders. Dorinda and her mother talked matters out fully one  afternoon over their sewing, in the sunny south room where the winds  got lost among the vines halfway through the open window. Mrs. Page  sighed and said she really did not know what to do. Dorinda did not  sigh; she did not know just what to do either, but there must be  something that could be done--there is always something that can be  done, if one can only find it. Dorinda sewed hard and pursed up her  red lips determinedly.    \"Don't you worry, Mother Page,\" she said briskly. \"We'll be like that  glorious old Roman who found a way or made it. I like overcoming  difficulties. I've lots of old Admiral Page's fighting blood in me,  you know. The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties  among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first--the capital  difficulties, as it were. Most important of all comes--\"    \"Leicester,\" said Mrs. Page.    Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful.    \"Well, I knew he was one of them, but I wasn't going to put him the  very first. However, we will. Leicester's case stands thus. He is a  pretty smart boy--if he wasn't my brother, I'd say he was a very smart  boy. He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take  him, has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy, wants to  go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course. Well,  of course, Mother Page, we can't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more  than we can send him to the moon.\"    \"No,\" mourned Mrs. Page, \"and the poor boy feels so badly over it. His  heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father.  He believes he could work his way through, if he could only get a  start. But there isn't any chance. And I can't afford to keep him at  school any longer. He is going into Mr. Churchill's store at Willow  Centre in the fall. Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place.  Leicester hates the thought of it--I know he does, although he never  says so.\"    \"Next to Leicester's college course we want--\"    \"Music lessons for Jean.\"    Dorinda winked again.    \"Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty?\" she said. \"That is,  one spelled with a capital?\"    \"Oh, yes, Dorinda dear. At least, I'm worried over it. Jean loves  music so, and she has never had anything, poor child, not even as much  school as she ought to have had. I've had to keep her home so much to  help me with the work. She has been such a good, patient little girl  too, and her heart is set on music lessons.\"    \"Well, she must have them then--after we get Leicester's year at the  academy for him. That's two. The third is a new--\"    \"The roof _must_ be shingled this fall,\" said Mrs. Page anxiously.  \"It really must, Dorinda. It is no better than a sieve. We are nearly  drowned every time it rains. But I don't know where the money to do it  is going to come from.\"    \"Shingles for the roof, three,\" said Dorinda, as if she were carefully  jotting down something in a mental memorandum. \"And fourth--now,  Mother Page, I _will_ have my say this time--fourthly, biggest capital  of all, a Nice, New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this  winter. Yes, yes, you must have them, dearest. It's absolutely  necessary. We can wait a year or so for college courses and music  lessons to grow; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some  more if we haven't enough. But a new dress and coat for you we must,  shall, and will have, however it is to be brought about.\"    \"I wouldn't mind if I never got another new stitch, if I could only  manage the other things,\" said Mrs. Page stoutly. \"If your Uncle  Eugene would only help us a little, until Leicester got through! He  really ought to. But of course he never will.\"    \"Have you ever asked him?\" said Dorinda.    \"Oh, my dear, no; of course not,\" said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone,  as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour's spoons.    \"I don't see why you shouldn't,\" said Dorinda seriously.    \"Oh, Dorinda, Uncle Eugene hates us all. He is terribly bitter against  us. He would never, never listen to any request for help, even if I  could bring myself to make it.\"    \"Mother, what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene? I have  never known the rights of it. I was too small to understand when I was  home before. All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us  or spoke to us when he met us anywhere, and we were all afraid of him  somehow. I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up  the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I wasn't good.  What made him our enemy? And how did he come to get all of  Grandfather Page's property when Father got nothing?\"    \"Well, you know, Dorinda, that your Grandfather Page was married  twice. Eugene was his first wife's son, and your father the second  wife's. Eugene was a great deal older than your father--he was  twenty-five when your father was born. He was always an odd man, even  in his youth, and he had been much displeased at his father's second  marriage. But he was very fond of your father--whose mother, as you  know, died at his birth--and they were good friends and comrades until  just before your father went to college. They then quarrelled; the  cause of the quarrel was insignificant; with anyone else than Eugene a  reconciliation would soon have been effected. But Eugene never was  friendly with your father from that time. I think he was jealous of  old Grandfather's affection; thought the old man loved your father  best. And then, as I have said, he was very eccentric and stubborn.  Well, your father went away to college and graduated, and then--we  were married. Grandfather Page was very angry with him for marrying  me. He wanted him to marry somebody else. He told him he would  disinherit him if he married me. I did not know this until we were  married. But Grandfather Page kept his word. He sent for a lawyer and  had a new will made, leaving everything to Eugene. I think, nay, I am  sure, that he would have relented in time, but he died the very next  week; they found him dead in his bed one morning, so Eugene got  everything; and that is all there is of the story, Dorinda.\"    \"And Uncle Eugene has been our enemy ever since?\"    \"Yes, ever since. So you see, Dorinda dear, that I cannot ask any  favours of Uncle Eugene.\"    \"Yes, I see,\" said Dorinda understandingly. To herself she added, \"But  I don't see why _I_ shouldn't.\"    Dorinda thought hard and long for the next few days about the capital  difficulties. She could think of only one thing to do and, despite old  Admiral Page's fighting blood, she shrank from doing it. But one  night she found Leicester with his head down on his books and--no, it  couldn't be tears in his eyes, because Leicester laughed scornfully at  the insinuation.    \"I wouldn't cry over it, Dorinda; I hope I'm more of a man than  _that_. But I do really feel rather cut up because I've no chance of  getting to college. And I hate the thought of going into a store. But  I know I must for Mother's sake, and I mean to pitch in and like it in  spite of myself when the time comes. Only--only--\"    And then Leicester got up and whistled and went to the window and  stood with his back"]]]
