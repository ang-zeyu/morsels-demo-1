The vault above, though  not so elaborate as that of Langton's chapel on the right hand, is a  fine example of lierne work, and the shafts are noticeable for their  capitals and bases. Among the devices are T and the syllable HUN,  followed by the figure of a tun; and T and the syllable SILK, followed  by the figure of a horse; signifying Thomas Hunton and Thomas Silkstede  respectively.    [Illustration: BISHOP LANGTON'S CHAPEL. _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    [Illustration: DETAIL OF LANGTON'S CHAPEL.]    The southern window of the Lady Chapel has recently been filled with a  memorial window to the late Bishop Thorold, whose tomb lies in the  cathedral precincts just below the new window. In pre-Reformation times  this window, like those on the north and east, was glazed with fine  painted glass, of which a few fragments still remain in the tracery. The  remaining portions of the old work have been worked in with the new by  Mr C.E. Kempe, the designer and executor. The memorial glass presents  scenes in the life of Christ, while above appear S. Birinus, Pope  Honorius, S. Swithun, S. Alphege, and other saints. The dedication  ceremony took place on August 7, 1897, two years after the burial of  Bishop Thorold at Winchester.    Of the two chapels which flank the Lady Chapel, that to the north is the  #Chapel of the Guardian Angels#, once the chantry of Bishop Adam de  Orlton, of whom no memorial here exists, though he is buried in the  chapel. This compartment is sometimes called the Portland chapel, owing  to the fact that it contains on the south side the tomb of Richard  Weston, Earl of Portland, who was treasurer to Charles I. A recumbent  bronze statue by Le Sueur adorns the tomb, while in the wall above are  four tabernacles, three of which contain mutilated busts, probably  representing members of his family. A mural monument of Bishop Peter  Mews, who is also interred here, is marked by a crozier and mitre. On  the north side, too, there is in the wall an aumbry with a shelf, having  a curious square head within a trefoil. The early vaulting of this  chapel has, between the ribs, figures of seraphim, which are very fresh  in colour.    [Illustration: QUEEN MARY'S CHAIR. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    The corresponding chapel to the south is #Bishop Langton's Chantry#,  though the work is partly De Lucy's, including the walls and the early  vaulting shafts. The defaced front-screen and the oak-panelling all  round are very rich examples of late Gothic, and the stone vaulting has  been compared in point of elaboration with that in the chapel of Henry  VII. at Westminster. On the groining, at the junction of the ribs, is  carved Bishop Langton's rebus, consisting of the musical sign for a  \"long\" upon a tun, while his motto _Laus tibi Christe_ also occurs. It  is supposed that the magnificent carved vine on the upper part of the  oak-panelling which runs round the chapel originally formed the rebus of  Langton's see, the tun from which it sprang being now lost. The  woodwork, which is certainly one of the most striking things in the  cathedral, is unfortunately mutilated, as is also part of the heraldic  work on the entrance door. At the east end of the chapel above the  former altar there is a row of seven tabernacles, under which is a  cornice which was originally gilt and painted. The statues which once  occupied the tabernacles are no longer extant. The central tomb here is  that of Bishop Langton himself. Queen Mary's chair now stands in this  chapel; it is in a wonderful state of preservation for its age, and the  woodwork is still sound.    The entrance to the #Crypts# is in the north transept, as was noted  above. They are three in number, the main division stretching from the  eastern tower-piers to the first piers of the retro-choir. It consists  of a central room divided by a row of five columns in the middle, with  an apsidal eastern termination, and is flanked by two aisles with square  eastern ends. The well here is said to be considerably older than the  building above it. From this opens out a narrower crypt, which also has  five columns down the centre, while its apse reaches to the eastern end  of the retro-choir. These crypts cannot, as some have supposed (and the  tradition still survives), form part of the old Saxon church, since it  has been fairly established that the site of this was not that of the  present building. The plan of the chambers is in perfect accord, as  Willis says, with that of Norman churches in general. The main crypt  shows by its circular apse what was the form of the east end in the old  Norman church. The actual work is strikingly like that of the transepts,  the peculiar thin square abacus, combined with a round capital, being a  noteworthy point in both these portions of the building. The third  crypt, which is narrow like the second, is rectangular in shape, and its  vaulting rests on columns. It is Early English in architecture, and is  contemporary with De Lucy's work in the upper part of the church. In  1886 the crypts were to a great extent cleared out to their original  level, a vast quantity of rubbish being removed. Many fragments of early  work still remain, though in too mutilated a form to indicate where they  originally stood.    The #stained glass# at Winchester can, perhaps, best be treated  separately from the windows which it occupies. Most of the information  may be found summed up in a paper addressed to the Archaeological  Association in September 1845, by Mr C. Winston. Two circles of Early  Decorated glass are to be seen in the west window, but they are merely  composed of coloured pieces arranged in geometrical patterns. The  general arrangement of the great window is, as has been already said,  kaleidoscopic, the fragments which compose it being too scattered to  admit of being put together again in their original form. The effect,  however, is striking, particularly at some distance from the west end.  There are remains of the original glass in the west windows of the  aisles and in the first window from the west in the south aisle, but the  Edingdon windows in the north aisle have lost their glass. The glass in  the above windows consists of the heads of canopies, though in the west  window some of the original figures are still to be seen. This is the  earliest Perpendicular glass in the cathedral, and may date from  Edingdon's time. Next in date is the glass in the other windows of the  nave aisles and clerestory windows, a little later than that in the west  window, and of the same character as that at New College, Oxford, in the  north, south, and west windows. Of this glass, apparently four figures  and part of their canopies have been removed to the first window from  the east in the choir clerestory. The heads of the three westerly  windows, to the north of the choir clerestory, showing canopy-work and  cherubim, come next in date, with eight canopied figures in the upper  tier of the two easterly windows on the south of this clerestory. The  latter seem to have come originally from some other window, being too  short for their present situation. Their date may be about the end of  the reign of Henry VI. The east window of the choir may be a little  earlier than 1525, and has introduced in it Bishop Fox's arms and motto,  _Est deo gracia_. This window has been much disturbed, the top central  light being filled with glass of Wykeham's period, while little of Fox's  glass seems to be in its original position. To Fox also may be  attributed part of the aisle windows north and south of the choir, and  some canopies in the side windows of the choir clerestory. Some late  glass, much mutilated, may be seen in the east window of the Lady  Chapel. Warner says of the two large windows, that \"the great east  window is remarkable for the beauty of its painted glass, which contains  the portraits of saints, and of some bishops of this see; it is whole  and entire, the west window is magnificent, but much inferior to this.\"    [Illustration: ONE OF THE MORTUARY CHESTS IN THE CHOIR SCREEN  (see \"Mortuary Chests\" in Chapter III).

Birinus "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#14)"],[1,"march.\"    \"Well, this would be like old times to him, I suppose,\" said Mr.  Pertell. \"But this is only in fun, my boy--to make motion pictures. So  take your cows away and we'll go on with the work. Drive 'em on,\" and  the boy did so with a curious, backward look at the girls in the  carriage, and at the Union soldiers, who were going back to their places  to get ready anew for the skirmish charge.    \"And this time we'll have it without cows,\" said Mr. Pertell. \"They  might go all right in a film of Sherman's march, but not in this  skirmish fight. All ready now. Take your places again.\"    The preliminary advance of the carriage, containing Ruth and Alice had  been filmed all right. Very little need be cut out. Once the cows were  beyond the camera range, Russ again began grinding away at the film.    \"Now come on--Union soldiers!\" cried the director.    From their waiting place Lieutenant Varley led his men; and as they  swept on past the carriage, Alice and Ruth registering fear, the  Confederates rushed out to meet them.    Then began the skirmish. Guns popped. Horses reared, some throwing their  riders unexpectedly, but this made it all the more realistic. Men  fought hand to hand with swords, using only the flats, of course. Horses  collided one with another, and the animals seemed to enter into the  spirit of the conflict fully as much as did the men. There was a rattle  of rifles, but no cannon were used in this scene.    Russ and his helpers filmed it, and, standing behind them watching the  mimic fight, was the director, shouting orders through his megaphone  and, when he could not make himself heard in this way, using a field  telephone, calling his instructions to helpers stationed out of sight in  the bushes, where they could relay the commands to those taking part in  the skirmish.    \"A little livelier now!\" yelled Mr. Pertell. \"Give way, you Union  fellows, as though you were beaten, and then drive them back to the  fight, Mr. Varley. That's the way!\"    The conflict raged and the cameras clicked away. It was all one to the  camera men--a parlor drama or a sanguinary conflict. So long as the  shutter worked perfectly, as long as the focus was correct and the film  ran freely, the camera men were satisfied.    \"Now you Confederates pretend to be overwhelmed, and then rally with a  rush and sweep the Unionists out of the thicket!\" ordered the director.    This was done, and, all the while, at one side of the picture crouched  Ruth and Alice, as two Southern girls. They had leaped from their  carriage and were waiting the outcome of the conflict, stooping down out  of the way of flying bullets.    This was a side scene in the war play, and did not involve the main  story. Ruth and Alice, as did the other main characters, assumed various  roles at times.    \"Come on now! You Unionists are beaten. Retreat!\" called the director,  and Lieutenant Varley's men rode off, leaving him and some others  injured on the field of the conflict.    It was here that Alice and Ruth took an active part again. Ruth rushed  up to the fallen lieutenant and felt his pulse. No sooner had she done  so than the director cried:    \"Stop the camera! That won't do, Miss DeVere!\"    \"Why not?\" she asked.    \"Because you felt his pulse with your thumb. No nurse would do that. The  pulse in the thumb itself is too strong to allow any one to feel the  pulse in another's wrist. Use the tips of your first and second fingers.  Now try again. Ready, Russ!\"    This time Ruth did it right. It was characteristic of Mr. Pertell to  notice a little detail like that.    \"Not one person in a hundred would object to the pulse being felt with  the thumb,\" he explained afterward; \"but the hundredth person in the  audience would be a doctor, and he'd know right away that the director  was at fault. It is the little things that count.\"    Ruth and Alice busied themselves ministering to the wounded who were  made prisoners by the Confederates. The lieutenant was put in their  carriage and driven away. That ended the scene at the place of the  skirmish.    \"Very well done!\" Mr. Pertell told the girls, as they prepared for the  next act, which was in a room of a Southern house, whither the wounded  had been carried.    These were busy days at Oak Farm. With the arrival of the two regiments  of the National Guard, pictures were taken every day, leading up to the  big battle scene, which had been postponed. When they were not posing  for the cameras, the guardsmen were drilling in accordance with the  regulations of the annual state encampment under the direction of the  regular army officers.    \"Well, have you quite recovered from your wounds?\" asked Alice of  Lieutenant Varley one day, as she met him outside the farmhouse.    \"Oh, yes, thanks to the care of your sister and yourself. By the way, I  hope your friend Miss Brown is not angry with me.\"    \"Why should she be?\"    \"Well, because I thought I had seen her before.\"    \"I don't believe she is. I haven't heard her say. But here she comes  now. You can ask her,\" and Estelle came around the turn of the path.  Seeing Alice talking with the lieutenant, she hesitated, but Alice  called:    \"Come on--we were just speaking about you.\"    \"I wondered why my ears burned,\" laughed Estelle.    \"Perhaps you two are going somewhere,\" said the officer, preparing to  take his leave.    \"Oh, to no place where you are not welcome,\" answered Alice, graciously,  with a side look at her companion to see if Estelle objected. But the  latter gave no sign, one way or the other.    \"Thank you!\" exclaimed the guardsman. \"I have to take part in a little  scene in about an hour, but I would enjoy a walk in the meanwhile. You  are both made up, I see?\"    \"Yes, we are Southern belles to-day,\" laughed Alice.    \"Belles every day,\" returned the lieutenant with a bow.    \"Nicely said!\" laughed Estelle. \"You are improving!\"    She and Alice wore the costumes of generations ago, big bonnets and  hoopskirts.    \"Let's go over and see what they're filming there,\" suggested Alice,  pointing to where a crossroads store had been put up.    The scene at the store was one to represent a dispute among some  Southerners and some Northern sympathizers. It was to end in a fight in  which one man was to draw his revolver.    All went well up to the quarrel, and then it became too realistic, for,  by some chance, there was a bullet in the revolver instead of a blank  cartridge, and it entered the leg of one of the disputants. He fell and  bled profusely.    \"Get Dr. Wherry!\" yelled Mr. Pertell.    \"Dr. Wherry went into the village this morning to get some stuff,\" Russ  said, \"and he hasn't come back yet.\"    \"Then somebody will have to go after him!\" cried the director.    \"I'll go!\" offered Alice. \"I can take this horse and carriage!\" for a  rig was hitched outside the \"store.\"    \"I'll go with you!\" cried Estelle, and then, in costume and made up for  the pictures as they were, they got into the vehicle and drove off.          CHAPTER XIV    IN THE SMOKE      \"Do you think he'll die?\" asked Estelle, as she took the reins and  flicked the horse lightly with the whip.    \"I hope not,\" answered Alice.    \"Did it make you faint to see the blood?\"    \"A little. Did it you?\"    \"Yes. I can't bear it! It makes me---- Oh, it makes me----\"    Estelle closed her eyes, and Alice was surprised to see her turn pale,  even under her rouge, and shudder.    \"That's queer,\" Alice said. \"I should have thought, being on a ranch as  you were, you might have become used to accidents and scenes of  violence.\"    \"Who said I was on a ranch?\"    \"Why, you did!\"    \"I did?\"    \"Yes; don't you remember? That day when we were talking about branding  cows----\"    \"Oh, maybe I did. I'd forgotten. Oh, dear! here comes an auto, and I'm  not sure about this horse. I'm afraid he'll start to rear.\"    At this intimation that there might be trouble, Alice's face took on a  worried look, and she fore-bore to press the questions she had been  asking Estelle.    The horse showed some signs of fear as he passed the automobile in the  road, but the man driving the car was considerate enough to stop his  machine and motion to the girls to pass. They did so, the horse getting  as far to one side of the road as he could, his nostrils distended and  his ears pricked forward.    \"There! Thank goodness that's over!\" sighed Estelle. \"Now to make speed  and get that doctor. I hope the man doesn't die.\"    \"I do too,\" acquiesced Alice. \"Did you see how sharply the man looked at  us?\"    \"Who, the man that was shot?\"    \"No, the one in the auto. He stared and stared!\"    \"Probably he wondered where in the world we got a horse in these days  that was afraid of an auto. I wonder myself where this steed has been in  hiding. There are so many cars now that it is a wonder horses aren't  using gasoline as perfume.\"    \"No, he wasn't looking at the horse,\" persisted Alice. \"He was looking  at us. Perhaps he knew you, Estelle.\"    \"Why do you say that? I'm sure I never saw him before. Maybe it was you  he was staring at.\"    \"No, it was you he was staring at, but I don't blame him. You are very  striking looking to-day.\"    \"It's this dress. Isn't it quaint?\"    \"And pretty! Oh, but we mustn't talk so frivolously when that poor man  may be dying. We must drive faster.\"    \"Talking isn't going to make the horse go any slower. In fact, I think  maybe he'll go quicker to get the trip over with sooner so he can be rid  of our chatter. But I don't think the poor man is badly hurt. He may  bleed a lot, but they can hold that in check until we get the doctor.\"    They drove on, and were presently in the village. They had been told  where Dr. Wherry had gone--to a drugstore to get some medical  supplies--and thither they made their way.    \"Do you notice how every one is staring at us?\" asked Alice, as they  drove along the streets.    \"They do seem to be,\" admitted Estelle, looking for the"]]]
