George felt cold. He turned. The shadows  of night wrapped him round, and little things in the hedgerows  chirped and chittered mockery at him as he stumbled down the lane.    George's request for a lonely furnished cottage somewhere in the  neighbourhood of the castle did not, as he had feared, strike the  Belpher house-agent as the demand of a lunatic. Every well-dressed  stranger who comes to Belpher is automatically set down by the  natives as an artist, for the picturesqueness of the place has  caused it to be much infested by the brothers and sisters of the  brush. In asking for a cottage, indeed, George did precisely as  Belpher society expected him to do; and the agent was reaching for  his list almost before the words were out of his mouth. In less  than half an hour George was out in the street again, the owner for  the season of what the agent described as a \"gem\" and the employer  of a farmer's wife who lived near-by and would, as was her custom  with artists, come in the morning and evening to \"do\" for him. The  interview would have taken but a few minutes, had it not been  prolonged by the chattiness of the agent on the subject of the  occupants of the castle, to which George listened attentively. He  was not greatly encouraged by what he heard of Lord Marshmoreton.  The earl had made himself notably unpopular in the village recently  by his firm--the house-agent said \"pig-headed\"--attitude in respect  to a certain dispute about a right-of-way. It was Lady Caroline,  and not the easy-going peer, who was really to blame in the matter;  but the impression that George got from the house-agent's  description of Lord Marshmoreton was that the latter was a sort of  Nero, possessing, in addition to the qualities of a Roman tyrant,  many of the least lovable traits of the ghila monster of Arizona.  Hearing this about her father, and having already had the privilege  of meeting her brother and studying him at first hand, his heart  bled for Maud. It seemed to him that existence at the castle in  such society must be little short of torture.    \"I must do something,\" he muttered. \"I must do something quick.\"    \"Beg pardon,\" said the house-agent.    \"Nothing,\" said George. \"Well, I'll take that cottage. I'd better  write you a cheque for the first month's rent now.\"    So George took up his abode, full of strenuous--if vague--purpose,  in the plainly-furnished but not uncomfortable cottage known  locally as \"the one down by Platt's.\" He might have found a worse  billet. It was a two-storied building of stained red brick, not one  of the thatched nests on which he had looked down from the hill.  Those were not for rent, being occupied by families whose ancestors  had occupied them for generations back. The one down by Platt's  was a more modern structure--a speculation, in fact, of the farmer  whose wife came to \"do\" for George, and designed especially to  accommodate the stranger who had the desire and the money to rent  it. It so departed from type that it possessed a small but  undeniable bath-room. Besides this miracle, there was a cosy  sitting-room, a larger bedroom on the floor above and next to this  an empty room facing north, which had evidently served artist  occupants as a studio. The remainder of the ground floor was taken  up by kitchen and scullery. The furniture had been constructed by  somebody who would probably have done very well if he had taken up  some other line of industry; but it was mitigated by a very fine  and comfortable wicker easy chair, left there by one of last year's  artists; and other artists had helped along the good work by  relieving the plainness of the walls with a landscape or two. In  fact, when George had removed from the room two antimacassars,  three group photographs of the farmer's relations, an illuminated  text, and a china statuette of the Infant Samuel, and stacked them  in a corner of the empty studio, the place became almost a home  from home.    Solitude can be very unsolitary if a man is in love. George never  even began to be bored. The only thing that in any way troubled his  peace was the thought that he was not accomplishing a great deal in  the matter of helping Maud out of whatever trouble it was that had  befallen her. The most he could do was to prowl about roads near  the castle in the hope of an accidental meeting. And such was his  good fortune that, on the fourth day of his vigil, the accidental  meeting occurred.    Taking his morning prowl along the lanes, he was rewarded by the  sight of a grey racing-car at the side of the road. It was empty,  but from underneath it protruded a pair of long legs, while beside  it stood a girl, at the sight of whom George's heart began to thump  so violently that the long-legged one might have been pardoned had  he supposed that his engine had started again of its own volition.    Until he spoke the soft grass had kept her from hearing his  approach. He stopped close behind her, and cleared his throat. She  started and turned, and their eyes met.    For a moment hers were empty of any recognition. Then they lit up.  She caught her breath quickly, and a faint flush came into her  face.    \"Can I help you?\" asked George.    The long legs wriggled out into the road followed by a long body.  The young man under the car sat up, turning a grease-streaked and  pleasant face to George.    \"Eh, what?\"    \"Can I help you? I know how to fix a car.\"    The young man beamed in friendly fashion.    \"It's awfully good of you, old chap, but so do I. It's the only  thing I can do well. Thanks very much and so forth all the same.\"    George fastened his eyes on the girl's. She had not spoken.    \"If there is anything in the world I can possibly do for you,\" he  said slowly, \"I hope you will let me know. I should like above all  things to help you.\"    The girl spoke.    \"Thank you,\" she said in a low voice almost inaudible.    George walked away. The grease-streaked young man followed him with  his gaze.    \"Civil cove, that,\" he said. \"Rather gushing though, what?  American, wasn't he?\"    \"Yes. I think he was.\"    \"Americans are the civillest coves I ever struck. I remember asking  the way of a chappie at Baltimore a couple of years ago when I was  there in my yacht, and he followed me for miles, shrieking advice  and encouragement. I thought it deuced civil of him.\"    \"I wish you would hurry up and get the car right, Reggie. We shall  be awfully late for lunch.\"    Reggie Byng began to slide backwards under the car.    \"All right, dear heart. Rely on me. It's something quite simple.\"    \"Well, do be quick.\"    \"Imitation of greased lightning--very difficult,\" said Reggie  encouragingly. \"Be patient. Try and amuse yourself somehow. Ask  yourself a riddle. Tell yourself a few anecdotes. I'll be with you  in a moment. I say, I wonder what the cove is doing at Belpher?  Deuced civil cove,\" said Reggie approvingly. \"I liked him. And now,  business of repairing breakdown.\"    His smiling face vanished under the car like the Cheshire cat.  Maud stood looking thoughtfully down the road in the direction in  which George had disappeared.        CHAPTER 8.    The following day was a Thursday and on Thursdays, as has been  stated, Belpher Castle was thrown open to the general public between  the hours of two and four. It was a tradition of long standing, this  periodical lowering of the barriers, and had always been faithfully  observed by Lord Marshmoreton ever since his accession to the title.  By the permanent occupants of the castle the day was regarded with  mixed feelings. Lord Belpher, while approving of it in theory, as he  did of all the family traditions--for he was a great supporter of  all things feudal, and took his position as one of the hereditary  aristocracy of Great Britain extremely seriously--heartily disliked  it in practice. More than once he had been obliged to exit hastily  by a further door in order to keep from being discovered by a drove  of tourists intent on inspecting the library or the great  drawing-room; and now it was his custom to retire to his bedroom  immediately after lunch and not to emerge until the tide of invasion  had ebbed away.    Keggs, the butler, always looked forward to Thursdays with  pleasurable anticipation. He enjoyed the sense of authority which  it gave him to herd these poor outcasts to and fro among the  surroundings which were an everyday commonplace to himself. Also  he liked hearing the sound of his own voice as it lectured in  rolling periods on the objects of interest by the way-side. But  even to Keggs there was a bitter mixed with the sweet. No one was  better aware than himself that the nobility of his manner,  excellent as a means of impressing the mob, worked against him when  it came to a question of tips. Again and again had he been harrowed  by the spectacle of tourists, huddled together like sheep, debating  among themselves in nervous whispers as to whether they could offer  this personage anything so contemptible as half a crown for himself  and deciding that such an insult was out of the question. It was  his endeavour, especially towards the end of the proceedings, to  cultivate a manner blending a dignity fitting his position with a  sunny geniality which would allay the timid doubts of the tourist  and indicate to him that, bizarre as the idea might seem, there was  nothing to prevent him placing his poor silver in more worthy  hands.    Possibly the only member of the castle community who was absolutely  indifferent to these public visits was Lord Marshmoreton. He made  no difference between Thursday and any other day. Precisely as  usual he donned his stained corduroys and pottered about his  beloved garden; and when, as happened on an average once a quarter,  some visitor, strayed from the main herd, came upon him as he  worked and mistook him for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#14)"],[1,"      the desire of restoring to the French those gifts                     which are dearest to great nations--independence                     and glory.

M. ***                     will give you a letter for him: do you understand                     me?\"--\"Yes, Sire.\"--\"But do your utmost to recover                     your manuscript before my departure. I see that you                     are anxious to keep it, and I will leave it with                     you. I only wish to read it.\" The Emperor read the                     manuscript, and he returned it to me, saying, \"Z***                     has told the truth, and nothing but the truth; keep                     his manuscript for future generations.\"]    I now fulfil my promise. I have not dared to make any alterations in  the narrative: if I had, I should have felt that I was betraying the  wishes of my friend. But I have suppressed the names of the parties  concerned, and I have expunged some passages, in which the Bourbon  family were treated with disrespect.          HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION OF THE 20th OF MARCH.      When Napoleon resigned his crown, I broke my sword. I swore that I  never more would use it in the service of France, or of the new  Sovereign of the nation. But the generous farewell of the Emperor  could not fail to affect me; and, conquered by the irresistible  influence which the love of glory and of our native land exercises  upon a French soldier, I soon awoke to more praiseworthy and more  tempered feelings. My recollections faded, my regrets were softened,  and I aspired most sincerely to the honour of being again useful to my  country, and to my country's King.    At first the character which I had earned, procured for me the most  gratifying reception. Dazzling prospects were held out to me. I  believed that I was treated with sincerity. This error was of short  duration. Deceived and baffled, I now understood that they were  cheating the army and myself. They affected to honour us in the  aggregate, because they were afraid of us; and they insulted us  individually, in conformity to their systematic hated. My character  was too proud to allow me to bear with the insults and the contempt  which they wished to pour out upon me. I resigned my commission.  France and her government sickened me; but my military enthusiasm had  not abated. I thought that I should be recollected by the Emperor, who  had distinguished me in the field of battle; and that he would deign  to grant that boon which was dearest to my heart; that he would allow  me to live and die in his service. I therefore made up my mind to  visit the isle of Elba.    Just, however, as I was on the point of departing, I was stopped by a  sudden thought. Abandoned, betrayed, and denied, by men whom he has  heaped with rewards and honours, will the Emperor really believe that  I am really attached to him? Perhaps he will even suspect that I am a  spy, and that the Bourbons have sent me to watch his words and  actions. I was still in relation with those persons who had formerly  enjoyed the confidence of the Emperor. Since the restoration, their  conduct had been marked by frankness and honesty. Their feelings led  them to be faithful to the person of Napoleon; their patriotism and  their principles led them to be devoted to his cause; and they had not  sought to conceal either their fidelity or their devotion. Many  efforts had been made to gain them over to the royal party, but they  had continued immoveable. I therefore thought, that whatever  recommendation I could obtain from any one of the persons in question,  would protect me from the suspicions of the Emperor; and to them I  therefore confided my plans and the causes of my uneasiness, without  hesitation or reserve.    The first, and the second, to whom I thus applied, severally assured  me that they took the most lively interest in the undertaking, and  they betrayed the most tender anxiety for its result. They desired me  to express to the Emperor the grief which his loss had occasioned to  them, and their hopes of seeing him once more; but both were afraid to  compromise themselves by writing to him, and I quitted them without  having obtained my wishes. Then I proceeded to the third, whom I shall  call Monsieur X. We had known each other in those eventful periods  when men are put to the test, and he had kindly formed and retained a  favourable opinion of my character and courage. I unveiled my projects  and my fears. \"Your fears,\" answered he, \"are well founded. The  Emperor will distrust you, and probably he will not allow you to  continue with him. My recommendation would, without doubt, be of great  utility to you, but I cannot give it without danger. Not that I should  be in danger, for my affection towards the Emperor is well known to  all the world, but we might put the Emperor himself in jeopardy; for,  if they were to take my letter from you, they might give it over to a  spy, nay, even to an assassin.\"    This argument appeared conclusive to me, but I answered, \"A lucky  thought flashes across my mind. You have acted so long and so often in  connexion with the Emperor, that surely you must be able to recollect  some circumstances, some disclosures known only to yourselves, which,  if I relate them to his Majesty, will prove to him that you trust me,  and that I am worthy of his trust.\"--\"Your idea is excellent; yet,\"  added he, \"I must either give you insignificant details, and then the  Emperor will have forgotten them, or I must reveal important secrets  to you, and I am forbidden by my duty to do so; yet I will turn the  matter over in my mind. Call here again to-morrow morning.\"    I called again. \"I have ransacked my memory,\" said M. X*** as he  accosted me, \"and here is the very thing which you want.\" He then  delivered a note to me. \"I had only considered your expedition to  Elba,\" continued M. X***, \"in relation to your own concerns; but it is  of much greater importance than you imagine, or than I myself thought  it would be. It may produce tremendous consequences. It is impossible  that the Emperor can be indifferent to what is going on in France. If  he was to put any questions to you on that head, how would you answer  him? You must be fully aware how very dangerous it might be if you  were to give him an erroneous idea of our political situation.\"--\"Though  I am a soldier by profession, yet I am not an utter novice in  politics. I have often reflected on the present position of France. I  really think that I understand enough of the matter to be able to  satisfy the curiosity of Napoleon.\"--\"I don't doubt it: but, come,  what is your opinion of affairs?\"    In answer to this interrogatory, I entered into an illustrative  analysis of the faults of government, and of the consequences ensuing  therefrom. Our conversation became warmer, and when, after having  discussed the time present, we began to contemplate futurity, our  thoughts were evolved with so much rapidity; we were carried so much  further than we intended, that we ourselves were astonished, and we  then both continued during a short interval in a kind of reverie. I  was the first who broke silence. \"Well,\" said I, \"suppose the Emperor,  after having questioned me, were to ask, Do you think the time of my  re-appearance in France is arrived, what must I answer?\"--\"You will  tell his Majesty that I could not dare to decide so important a  question; but that he may consider it as a positive and incontestible  fact that our present government (as you have well observed) has  wholly lost the confidence of the people and of the army; that  discontent has increased to the highest pitch; and that it is  impossible to believe that the government can stand much longer  against the universal dislike. You will add, that the Emperor is the  only object of the regret and hope of the nation. He, in his wisdom,  will decide what he ought to do.\"--\"If he asks me whether this opinion  is only yours, or whether Messrs. ******* all share in it, what shall  I answer?\"--\"Tell him that since his abdication those persons have  ceased to be in communication with each other, but that my opinion is  conformable to the general opinion.\"--\"I am now able to answer all  the questions which the Emperor may ask. Adieu.\"    We embraced each other repeatedly, and we parted.    As soon as I had quitted M. X*** all that had passed between us filled  my mind again. I now contemplated at leisure the mission which I was  called upon to fulfil. I measured its extent, and weighed its  consequences, and I could not help feeling astonished, and in some  measure alarmed, by the result of this self-examination. So long as I  merely intended to go to Elba for the sole purpose of offering my  services to the Emperor, my journey appeared to be nothing out of the  common course of things, and I thought that I should not have  hesitated to declare to the government that I was going to rejoin my  former benefactor, the Sovereign of my choice; but since the object of  my journey had become so much more important; since, to use the words  of M. X***, it might produce tremendous consequences, it seemed that  the government would not fail to watch me; that it would dog me in my  path, and endeavour to spy out all my words and actions.    Hence I became suspicious and uneasy. The note of M. X*** appeared an  immense burthen. I got it by heart, and then I threw it in the fire.  Instead of asking at once for a passport to Genoa or Leghorn, as I had  at first intended, I asked for a passport to Milan. There was a  General officer then residing in that city whom I knew; and I thought  that if the Police were to question me, I might then declare"]]]
