It is  the desire for \"independence,\" the fear of following a conventionality,  a fear that calls itself audacity, which brushes away the delicate and  scientific of this exquisite poet simply because he does not represent a  Movement. And yet all these new movements are very old movements. The  result of the education given me by books was to convince me that the  man of culture proclaims himself third-rate if he looks on any literary  expression as really new and if he cannot enjoy the old, when the old is  of all time. The beautiful and the real can never be old or new because  they are the same through the movement of time. To explain what I mean,  let me come suddenly down to date and permit me to quote from Sir Arthur  Quiller-Couch's \"On the Art of Reading.\" He is writing of the Bible,  which is never old:         I daresay, after all, that the best way is not to bother a boy too       early and overmuch with history; that the best way is to let him       ramp at first through the Scriptures even as he might through \"The       Arabian Nights\": to let him take the books as they come, merely       indicating, for instance, that Job is a great poem, the Psalms       great lyrics, the story of Ruth a lovely idyll, the Song of Songs       the perfection of an Eastern love-poem. Well, and what then? He       will certainly get less of \"The Cotter's Saturday Night\" into it,       and certainly more of the truth of the East. There he will feel the       whole splendid barbaric story for himself: the flocks of Abraham       and Laban; the trek of Jacob's sons to Egypt for corn; the figures       of Rebekah at the well, Ruth at the gleaning, and Rizpah beneath       the gibbet; Sisera bowing in weariness; Saul--great Saul--by the       tent-prop with the jewels in his turban:         \"All its lordly male-sapphires, and rubies courageous at heart.\"         Or consider--to choose one or two pictures out of the tremendous       procession--consider Michal, Saul's royal daughter: how first she       is given in marriage to David to be a snare for him; how, loving       him, she saves his life, letting him down from the window and       dressing up an image on the bed in his place; how, later, she is       handed over to another husband Phaltiel, how David demands her       back, and she goes:         \"And her husband (Phaltiel) went with her along weeping behind her       to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.\"         Or, still later, how the revulsion takes her, Saul's daughter as       she sees David capering home before the ark, and how her affection       had done with this emotional man of the ruddy countenance, so prone       to weep in his bed:         \"And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal,       Saul's daughter\"--         Mark the three words--         \"Michal, Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw King       David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in       her heart.\"    Mr. Galsworthy or Mr. W. L. George or Mr. Maxwell, who are rapidly  becoming too old-fashioned for the young, or Mrs. Wharton, or Mrs.  Gertrude Atherton would treat this episode in sympathy with what they  might conceive to be the trend of present emotion; for it is with the  emotions and not with the mind or the will that the novelist of the day  before yesterday mostly deals. If Mr. James Huneker had translated this  into the prose of his moment, it would have flamed with minutely carved  jewels, glowed with a perfume and colour of crushed roses, and choked  the reader with the odour of musk. But could he have made it any  \"newer\"? Or if he could have made it \"newer,\" could he have made it more  splendid and appealing?    The old is new, and the new is old in art and literature--in life  itself, and the man who scorned Keats because Swinburne and Rossetti  were new; or who scorns Browning--the best of Browning--lacks the first  requisite of true cultivation which is founded on the truth that beauty  is beyond the touch of time. The women in Fran[c,]ois Villon's \"Ballade of  Dead Ladies\" are gone, but their beauty remains in that song. This  beauty might be none the less beautiful if expressed in _vers libre_;  its beauty might take a new flavour from our time. The fact only that it  was of our time and treated in the manner of our time, could not give it  that essential and divine something which is perennial, universal, and  perhaps eternal.    Much affectionate reading of poetry--and poetry read in any other way  is like the crackling of small sticks under a pot in the open air on a  damp day--leads one to consider the structure of verse and to ask how  singing effects are best produced. This inquiry has led some of the  sincerest of the younger poets to throw aside the older conventions,  and, imitating Debussy, Richard Strauss, and even newer composers, to  produce that \"free verse\" which, in the hands of the inexpert, the lazy,  or the ignorant, becomes lawless verse. It is exasperating to the  intolerant to find writers, young in experience if not always young in  age, talking of themselves as discoverers--brave or audacious  discoverers--as adventurers, reckless as Balboa, or Cortez, or Ponce de  Le['o]n; and then, to hear some of the old and conventional violently  attacking these verse makers as if they were new and dangerous  revolutionists.    The truth is that _vers libre_ has its place, and it ought to have a  high place; but the writer who attempts it must have a very perfect ear  for the nuances of music and great art in his technique applied to the  use of words. Some of the disciples of Miss Amy Lowell have this, but  they are few. Whether Miss Lowell has mastered the science or not, she  has the fine art of producing musical effects, delicate and various and  even splendid. But there are others!    It may have been Tennyson, or Theocritus, or Campion that led me to read  Coventry Patmore. I know that it was not his \"The Angel in the House\"  which led me on. That seemed as little interesting or important as the  proverbial sayings of Martin Farquhar Tupper; but one day I found \"The  Unknown Eros\" and a little later \"The Toys,\" and then his \"Night and  Sleep,\" one of the most musical poems in our language.        How strange at night the bay      Of dogs, how wild the note      Of cocks that scream for day,      In homesteads far remote;      How strange and wild to hear      The old and crumbling tower,      Amid the darkness, suddenly      Take tongue and speak the hour!    Although the music of \"Night and Sleep\" is not dependent upon the rime,  it is plain--as the form of poetry appeals to the ear--that the rime is  a gain. Yet one does not miss it in the fifth and seventh lines of each  stanza. The real musical charm of the poem--only one stanza, of four,  is given here--lies in the management of the rhythm.         We have only to fill up the measure in every line as well as in the       seventh, in order to change this verse from the slowest and most       mournful to the most rapid and high-spirited of all English, the       common eight-syllable quatrain,    says Mr. Patmore in his \"Essay on English Metrical Law,\"         a measure particularly recommended by the early critics, and       continually chosen by poets in all times for erotic poetry on       account of its joyful air. The reason of this unusual rapidity of       movement is the unusual character of the eight-syllable verse as       acatalectic, almost all other kinds of verse being catalectic on at       least one syllable, implying a final pause of corresponding       duration.    Mr. Patmore here shows that the rime in this lovely \"Night and Sleep\" is  merely accessory, a lightly played accompaniment to a song which would  be as beautiful a song without it, yet which gains a certain accent  through this accompaniment; and that the real questions in verse are of  rhythm and time. Tennyson, whose technique, even in the use of  sibilants, will bear the closest scrutiny, often proves the merely  accessory value of rime, but in no instance more fully than in        Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,      Tears from the depth of some divine despair      Rise in the heart and gather in the eyes,      In looking on the happy autumn fields,      And thinking of the days that are no more.    There is every reason why the modern reader should have become tired of  academic poetry. When poetry divorced itself from music and became the  slave of fixed rules of metre which could not be imitated with any real  success in English, it sealed its own fate as a beloved visitant to the  hearts of the people. Pope and his coterie closed the door on lyrical  poets like Thomas Campion, and in their hearts they, like Voltaire,  rather despised Shakespeare for his vulgarisms.    The truth that poetry was primarily written to be sung is forgotten, and  even in France the chant of the Alexandrine, which both Rachel and Sarah  Bernhardt restored, was lost in a monotonous recitation. For myself, I  tried to get to the root of the matter by reading Thomas  Campion--Charles Scribner's Sons print a good edition of his songs,  masks, etc., edited by A. H. Bullen--as an antidote to Walt Whitman. In  fact, my acquaintance with the Poet of Camden convinced me that his use  of what is to-day called _vers libre_ resembled somewhat Carlyle's  Teutonic contortions of style. It was impossible to get from the \"Good  Gray Poet\" the reasons of his method. I gathered that he looked on  rhythm as sometimes a walk, a quick-step, a saunter, a hop-and-skip, a  hurried dash, or a slow march; it seemed to depend with him on the  action of the heart, the acceleration of the pulse, or the movement of  the thought.    But no one who knows the best in Walt Whitman's poems can fail to  perceive that there were times when he understood thoroughly that  poetry, expressed poetically,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#14)"],[1,"ration:      _\"How are you?\" said one.     \"How are you?\" returned the other.     \"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"_    ]    'Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,' said the first  speaker, 'for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I'll  offer to go if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I'm not  at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to  stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!'    Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.  Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.    The phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons  meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie  here.    He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very  wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing  well in their esteem in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a  business point of view.    'How are you?' said one.    'How are you?' returned the other.    'Well!' said the first, 'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?'    'So I am told,' returned the second. 'Cold, isn't it?'    'Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?'    'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!'    Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their  parting.    Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should  attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling  assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to  consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to  have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was  Past, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of  any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.  But nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some  latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every  word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the  shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the  conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would  render the solution of these riddles easy.    He looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man  stood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his  usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among  the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little  surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of  life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out  in this.    Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched  hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,  from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,  that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,  and feel very cold.    They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,  where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its  situation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop  and houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.  Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of  smell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole  quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.    Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling  shop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and  greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of  rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse  iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred  and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and  sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a  charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly  seventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without  by a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and  smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.    Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a  woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely  entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was  closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by  the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.  After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with  the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.    'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered  first. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the  undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a  chance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'    'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his  pipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it  long ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut  the door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of  metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no  such old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,  we're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'    The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked  the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky  lamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth  again.    While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on  the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her  elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.    'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'Every person  has a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!'    'That's true, indeed!' said the laundress. 'No man more so.'    'Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the  wiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?'    'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. 'We should hope  not.'    'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for  the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?'    'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.    'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,'  pursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had  been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with  Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.'    'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber. 'It's a  judgment on him.'    'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it  should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands  on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value  of it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for  them to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves  before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.'    But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in  faded black, mounting the breach first, produced _his_ plunder. It was  not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons,  and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined  and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give  for each upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found  that there was nothing more to come.    'That's your account,' said Joe, 'and I wouldn't give another sixpence,  if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who's next?'      [Illustration: _\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains.\"_]    Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two  old fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few  boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.    'I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine, and that's  the way I ruin myself,' said old Joe. 'That's your account. If you asked  me for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being  so liberal, and knock off half-a-crown.'    'And now undo _my_ bundle, Joe,' said the first woman.    Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,  and, having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large heavy  roll of some dark stuff.    'What do you call this?' said Joe. 'Bed-curtains?'    'Ah!' returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed  arms. 'Bed-curtains!'    'You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and all, with him lying  there?' said Joe.    'Yes, I do,' replied the woman. 'Why not?'    'You were born to make your fortune,' said Joe, 'and you'll certainly do  it.'    'I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by  reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as he was, I promise you,  Joe,' returned the woman coolly. 'Don't drop that oil upon the blankets,  now.'    'His blankets?' asked Joe.    'Whose else's do you think?' replied the woman. 'He isn't likely to take  cold without 'em, I dare say.'    'I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?' said old Joe, stopping  in his work, and looking up.    'Don't you be afraid of that,' returned the woman. 'I an't so fond of  his company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah!  you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won't find  a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine  one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.'    '"]]]
