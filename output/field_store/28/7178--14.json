Where's  mother?\"    \"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.\"    \"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she  'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and now  she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't there  no water, nor nothing to eat?\"    \"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient awhile,  and then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and  then you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like  leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie. What's  that you've got?\"    \"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,  holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to home  I'll give them to brother Bob.\"    \"You'll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man confidently.  \"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember when  we left the river?\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But there  was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't  turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you  and--and----\"    \"And you couldn't wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely,  staring up at his grimy visage.    \"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian  Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,  your mother.\"    \"Then mother's a deader too,\" cried the little girl dropping her face in  her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.    \"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some  chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and  we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters.  There's an almighty small chance for us now!\"    \"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking  her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.    \"I guess that's about the size of it.\"    \"Why didn't you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You gave  me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with  mother again.\"    \"Yes, you will, dearie.\"    \"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she  meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot  of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was  fond of. How long will it be first?\"    \"I don't know--not very long.\" The man's eyes were fixed upon the  northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared  three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did  they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown  birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then  settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the  vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.    \"Cocks and hens,\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their  ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \"Say, did  God make this country?\"    \"In course He did,\" said her companion, rather startled by this  unexpected question.    \"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\" the  little girl continued. \"I guess somebody else made the country in these  parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the  trees.\"    \"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\" the man asked diffidently.    \"It ain't night yet,\" she answered.    \"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you  bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the  waggon when we was on the Plains.\"    \"Why don't you say some yourself?\" the child asked, with wondering eyes.    \"I disremember them,\" he answered. \"I hain't said none since I was half  the height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out,  and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.\"    \"Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,\" she said, laying the shawl  out for that purpose. \"You've got to put your hands up like this. It  makes you feel kind o' good.\"    It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see  it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little  prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,  and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless  heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were  face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other  deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The  prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder  until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her  protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved  to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed  himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the  tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the  man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,  and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.    Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight  would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali  plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and  hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually  growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud.  This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it  could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more  fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one  of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was  approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As  the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two  castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the  figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the  apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for  the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base  of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right  across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons  and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who  staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the  waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently  no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had  been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new  country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and  rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels  and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to  rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.    At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced  men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching  the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among  themselves.    \"The wells are to the right, my brothers,\" said one, a hard-lipped,  clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.    \"To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\"  said another.    \"Fear not for water,\" cried a third. \"He who could draw it from the  rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\"    \"Amen! Amen!\" responded the whole party.    They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and  keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag  above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,  showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight  there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while  fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word  'Redskins' was on every lip.    \"There can't be any number of Injuns here,\" said the elderly man who  appeared to be in command. \"We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no  other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\"    \"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\" asked one of the band.    \"And I,\" \"and I,\" cried a dozen voices.    \"Leave your horses below and we will await you here,\" the Elder  answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their  horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the  object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and  noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.  The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock  until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had  first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him  throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining  him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their  eyes.    On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a  single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,  long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid  face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him  lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown  sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his  velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of  snow-white"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24407"],[0,"The Italian Cook Book (#14)"],[1,"d. When half cooked, season moderately with salt and  pepper. If necessary, moisten with broth or water. During the cooking  the saucepan must be covered with its cover and with a sheet of paper  greased with fat or oil. The stufato will be ready after about three  hours' cooking on a low fire.      171    SOUTHERN STEW    (Stufato Meridionale)    Put the piece of meat in a saucepan of such a size that it remains  completely filled, moisten with two cups of water and two of white wine,  season with salt and pepper and cook for five hours on a low fire.      172    STEW MILANAISE    (Stufato alla milanese)    Beat and flatten a good piece of meat and lard with bacon or ham cut in  small pieces. Season with salt, pepper and a taste of cinnamon. Sprinkle  flour over the meat.    Place in a saucepan a little fat of beef chopped with a middle sized  onion and brown with a piece of butter. When the onion is browned,  remove it and place the meat over the melted butter. Brown with melted  butter. Then fill the saucepan with half water, half red wine, but only  when the meat is browned from all sides. Cover the saucepan the best you  can, with cover and greased paper and let it simmer for five or six  hours on a very low fire.    After removing the stew, let it cool, rub the gravy through a sieve, put  again on the fire and serve hot.      173    FRENCH STEW    (Stufato alla francese)    Prepare on the bottom of the saucepan a layer of thin slices of ham, on  which place several little cubes also of bacon. In the middle place a  bunch of parsley, and around this some cloves, half an onion sliced, a  few carrots in little cubes several young onions, bay-leaf, salt, and  pepper.    On this bed lay the meat that may be larded with bacon or ham and  seasoned with salt, pepper and a taste of cinnamon. Pour on the meat two  cups of soup stock or water and one cup of white wine. Cover the  saucepan hermetically and cook on a very low fire for five hours.    When the stufato is to be served cold, the gravy is to be rubbed  through a sieve before it gets cold.         =Note.=--In these and similar dishes we have indicated the use of       wine, which is a common ingredient, in small quantities in Italian       and French cooking. This, however, can always be dispensed with if       its taste is not appreciated, or for any other reason.      174    TROUT ALPINE    (Trota all'alpigiana)    These are many ways to prepare this delicious fish, found in abundance  in the many streams of clear water that run from the Alps and the  Apennine mountains. Often the trout is cooked in wine, but, of course,  this part many be changed.    For the =trota all'alpigiana=, so called because it is the favorite dish  of Piedmont, the trout must be cleaned, scaled, washed, wiped then  salted and left under the action of the salt for about an hour.    Pour in a fish-kettle one quart of white wine to which will be added  three medium sized onions a few cloves, two sections of garlic and a  little bunch made of thyme, bay-leaf, basil or mint; finally a piece of  butter as large as an egg, dipped in flour. Then put the trout in the  fish-kettle and place on a strong fire. When the liquid has boiled the  trout is cooked. Remove the onions and the bunch of greens and serve the  trout with its gravy and some parsley.      175    TROUT LOMBARD    (Trota fritta)    Clean, scale, wash and wipe the trout. Salt and leave for half an hour.  Fill with water half a fish-kettle; add half a lemon, two bay-leaves,  one carrot light or ten berries of pepper, one onion divided into four  parts, salt and three cloves. When the water is lukewarm, dip in the  trout. Cook on a moderate fire and serve the trout with parsley, slices  of lemon and young potatoes boiled. A good fish-sauce ought to accompany  it.      176    FRIED TROUT    (Trota fritta)    Small and young trouts are best for frying. Scale, clean, wash and wipe.  Then dip in flour and fry like the other fish in oil or in butter. Serve  with browned parsley and lemon.      177    TROUT WITH ANCHOVIES    (Trota alle acciughe)    Scale, clean wash and wipe the trouts. Cut the sides and place to pickle  with salt, pepper berries, garlic, parsley and onions chopped fine; with  mushrooms chopped fine with thyme, bay-leaf and mint, all seasoned with  good olive oil. Rub the pickled pieces at the sieve and place it and  the trout in a baking-tin. Bake in the oven and serve with anchovy  sauce (No. 17).      178    EGGS WITH ONION SAUCE    (Uova trippate)    Prepare some hard boiled eggs, shell and cut into disks one third of an  inch thick.    Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter in which brown half an onion cut  into thin slices, to be removed from the butter when browned. Then add  to the butter two teaspoonfuls of flour, mix but don't allow to brown,  thin with a cup of hot broth, add salt and pepper and let simmer for ten  minutes. Put the sliced eggs in the sauce to warm them, stir a little,  but carefully to avoid breaking them, and do not boil again. Just before  serving add to the sauce a teaspoonful of cream and stir carefully.      179    EGGS WITH HAM    (Uova al prosciutto)    Place in a frying pan as many pieces of butter, large like a nut, as  there are eggs to be cooked. For each piece of butter put a little slice  of ham and place the frying pan on the fire. As soon as the butter is  melted break an egg on each slice of ham. Let cook for ten minutes on a  moderate fire.      180    EGGS WITH TOMATO SAUCE    (Uova al pomidoro)    Prepare some hard boiled eggs, cut them through the middle lengthwise,  place in good order upon a plate and pour some good tomato sauce, taking  care not to cover the upper part of the eggs, which must emerge from the  sauce.    Instead of the tomato, the eggs may be arranged with a =balsamella=  sauce (No. 54).      181    SCRAMBLED EGGS    (Uova strapazzate)    Break the eggs in a plate, assuring first that they are all fresh.    Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter about as big as an egg. When it is  melted pour the egg and scramble them with a fork on a low fire.    When the eggs are cooked season moderately with salt and butter. Just  when you take them away from the fire and before serving add a  tablespoonful of milk or liquid cream. Serve hot with a little grated  cheese.    The scrambled eggs can be served with points of asparagus, truffles,  mushrooms, etc. which are prepared just as if they were to go in an  omelet.          PART II    PASTRY, SWEETS, FROZEN DELICACIES, SYRUPS      182    PUDDING OF HAZELNUTS    (Budino di nocciuole)    Shell half a pound of hazelnuts in warm water and dry them well at the  sun or on the fire, then grind them very fine, together with sugar, of a  weight somewhat less than the nuts. Put one quart of milk on the fire,  and when it begins to boil, put two third lb. lady fingers or macaroons  crumbed and let it boil for five minutes, adding a small piece of  butter. Rub everything through a sieve and put back on the fire with the  nuts to dissolve the sugar. Let it cool and add six eggs, first the  yolks, then the white beaten, pour in a mold greased with butter and  sprinkled with bread crumbs ground fine. The mold must not be all full.  Bake in the oven and serve cold.    This dose will be sufficient for eight or ten persons.      183    CRISP BISCUITS    (Biscotti croccanti)      One pound of flour.    Half a pound granulated sugar.    1/4 lb. sweet almonds, whole and shelled, mixed to a few pine-seeds.    A piece of butter, one and a half ounce.    A pinch of anise-seeds.    Five eggs.    A pinch of salt.    Leave back the almonds and pine-seeds to add them afterward, and mix  everything with four eggs, so as to use the fifth if it is necessary to  make a soft dough. Divide into four cakes half an inch thick and as  large as a hand, place them in a receptacle greased with butter and  sprinkled with flour. Glaze the cakes with yolk of eggs. Bake in the  oven, but only as much as will still permit cutting the cakes into  slices, which you will do the day after, as the crust will then be  softened. Put the slices back in the oven, so that they will be toasted  on both sides and you will have the crisp biscuits.      184    SOFT BISCUITS    (Biscotti teneri)    For these biscuits it would be necessary to have a tin box about four  inches wide and a little less long than the oven used. In this way the  biscuits will have a corner on both sides and, if cut a little more than  half an inch, they will be of the right proportion. The ingredients  needed are:      Flour, about two ounces.    Potato meal, a little less.    Sugar, four ounces (1/4 lb.)    Sweet almonds 1-1/2 ounce.    Candied orange or angelica, one ounce.    Fruit preserve, one ounce.    Three eggs.    Skin the almonds, cut them in half lengthwise and dry in the sun or at  the fire. Pastry cooks usually leave them with the skin but it is much  preferable to skin them. Cut in little cubes the candied fruits and the  preserve.    Stir for a long while, about half an hour the sugar in the egg-yolks and  a little flour then add the white of the eggs well beaten and when every  thing is well beaten add the flour, letting it fall from a sieve. Mix  slowly and scatter on the mixing the almonds and the cubes of candied  and preserved fruit. Grease and sprinkle the tin box with flour. Bake in  the oven and cut the biscuits the day after. If desired these can also  be roasted on both sides.      185    BISCUITS SULTAN    (Biscotto alla sultana)      Granulated sugar, six ounces.    Flour, four ounces.    Potato meal, two ounces.    Currants, three ounces.    Candied fruits, one ounce.    Five eggs.    A taste of lemon peel.    Two tablespoonfuls of brandy.    Put first on the fire the currants and the candied fruits cut in very  little cubes with as much brandy or cognac as is necessary to cover  them: when it boils, light the brandy and let it burn out of the fire  until the liquor"]]]
