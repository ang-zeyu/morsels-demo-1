[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#14)"],[1,"features of the Revolutionary War in Georgia have  been briefly noted.    History has turned her eyes away from the more horrible details; but  by reading between the lines, and taking advantage of the hints and  suggestions, it is not hard to get a tolerably fair idea of the methods  that were pursued on both sides. Even Colonel Charles C. Jones, jun.,  whose \"History of Georgia\" is thus far the most complete that has been  written, touches lightly on the cruelties practiced in the efforts of  the British and Tories to wrest Upper Georgia from the control of the  Americans. There are matters that History cannot deal with and maintain  her dignity.    There can be no doubt that the British and the Tories began their  cruelties without considering the results to which their acts would  lead. It is an easy matter at this late day to see how naturally the  war, in the region tributary to Augusta, degenerated into a series of  crimes and barbarities foul enough to cause History to hold her hands  before her eyes. When Colonel Campbell, assisted by Colonel Brown,  advanced to attack Augusta, it was the only American post that had  not surrendered to the King's men, and its capture would complete the  subjugation of Georgia from a military point of view. The city fell  without a struggle, and the American forces retreated across the river.  It was natural that the British, and the Tories who were acting with  them, should take advantage of this victory to bring the whole region  above and around Augusta to terms. The sooner this was done, the sooner  would all Georgia be restored to her relations with his Majesty George  III. No time was to be lost. Therefore Colonel Campbell, the British  commander, tarried in Augusta but a few days. He left Colonel Brown  in charge, and marched in the direction of Wilkes County. Those of the  inhabitants who had Tory sympathies were to be encouraged; but those who  were disaffected were to be dealt with summarily, so as to put an end,  at once and forever, to the disloyalty that had been active in that  region. This plan was carried out promptly and violently. The severest  punishment was the portion of those who refused to take the oath of  allegiance. Plunder and the torch were the portions of those who chanced  to be away from home, fighting for their country. Their helpless  wives and children were left homeless, and destitute of provisions.  Fortunately a great many stanch Liberty Boys had carried their families,  their household effects, and their cattle, into South Carolina as soon  as they heard of the fall of Augusta; but many had remained at home, and  the sufferings of these were severe.    Another explanation of the extreme cruelty with which the war in Upper  Georgia was waged after the fall of Augusta, was the fact that Colonel  Brown, who had been left in command by Colonel Campbell, had some old  scores to settle. At the very beginning of the struggle he had been  arrested in Augusta by some of the Liberty Boys, tarred and feathered,  and paraded through the public streets, on account of his outspoken  loyalty to the King. Still another reason was the fact that Daniel  McGirth, who had been maltreated by an American officer, was among the  officers who had accompanied Colonel Brown. McGirth held every American  responsible for the treatment he had received, and he spared few that  fell into his hands. Thus, between the anxiety of the British to conquer  Georgia completely, and the desires of Brown and McGirth to revenge  themselves, the Americans in Upper Georgia were made the victims of the  most inhuman barbarities.    The Americans under Elijah Clarke lost no time in retaliating, and  thus was begun a contest that may be aptly described as a war of  extermination. Clarke was enabled to defeat the British and the Tories  wherever they opposed him on anything like equal terms, and this fact  added to the rigor with which they treated the Americans who were so  unfortunate as to fall into their hands. Shortly after the affair at  Musgrove's Mill, in which Clarke defeated the British and the Tories,  Lord Cornwallis addressed a circular letter to the officers commanding  the advanced posts. He declared, \"The inhabitants of the Provinces who  have subscribed to and taken part in this revolt shall be punished  with the utmost rigor; and also those who will not turn out shall be  imprisoned, and their whole property taken from them or destroyed. I  have ordered,\" he goes on to say, \"in the most positive manner, that  every militiaman who has borne arms with us, and afterwards joined the  enemy, shall be immediately hanged. I desire you will take the most  vigorous measures to punish the rebels in the district in which you  command, and that you obey in the strictest manner the directions I have  given in this letter relative to the inhabitants in this country.\"    Here was authority broad enough to cover every crime that the British  and the Tories might see fit to commit, and they stretched it to the  utmost limit. They burned houses and destroyed property. They insulted  and inhumanly treated women and children. They hanged the innocent. They  went about the country practicing every barbarity that their savage and  bloodthirsty natures could suggest. It was no wonder that the Americans  retaliated whenever they had the opportunity. It was no wonder that  Elijah Clarke, naturally independent and irritable, should fail to see  the justice or necessity of treating the Tories he captured as prisoners  of war.    The situation of the Americans became so serious that Clarke determined  to strike a heavy blow. He returned from Carolina to Wilkes County in  September, 1780, and in two days succeeded in placing in the field  three hundred and fifty men. With this force, strengthened by eighty men  recruited in Carolina, he boldly marched on Augusta. The movement was so  unexpected, that, but for the fact that the advance guard fell in with  an Indian camp which it was compelled to attack, Colonel Brown would  have been taken completely by surprise. But the retreating Indians gave  him notice, and he took refuge with his command in a strong building  known as the White House. The siege began on the 14th. By daylight on  the 16th Clarke had succeeded in cutting the garrison off from its water  supply. The sufferings of the men, especially the wounded, became most  intense. The Americans could hear their cries for water and for medical  aid. Brown appears to have been as brave as he was cruel. Though he was  shot through both thighs, he remained at the head of his men; and his  great courage sustained the spirits of his followers. Clarke summoned  him to surrender on the 17th. He not only refused, but warned the  American commander that the demonstration he was making against the  King's men would bring destruction to the western part of Georgia.    Meanwhile some of Clarke's men had gone to visit their families, and  others were more interested in securing plunder than in forwarding  the cause of independence. Colonel Brown, as soon as he heard of the  approach of the Americans, had sent several messengers by different  routes to inform Colonel Cruger of the state of affairs. Cruger, who was  in Carolina at Ninety-six, promptly set his men in motion, and on the  morning of the 18th appeared on the bank of the Savannah, opposite  Augusta. Under the circumstances, Clarke was compelled to retreat. He  had suffered a loss of sixty, killed and wounded. In retreating, he was  compelled to leave twenty-nine of his wounded men behind. Among these  was Captain Ashby, one of the bravest and most humane of the officers  of the American army. This unfortunate officer and the men with him fell  into the hands of the enemy. Colonel Brown was so severely wounded that  he was unable to move about; so he ordered Captain Ashby and twelve of  the wounded prisoners to be hanged on the staircase of the White House,  where he might see their sufferings and gloat over their agonies. These  men were cruelly strangled before Brown's eyes. But their fate was a  happy one compared with that of their wounded companions. Those men were  turned over to the red savages, who were the allies of the British. The  Indians received the prisoners with howls of delight, and began at once  to torture them in every conceivable way. They formed a circle, and  marched around the Americans, cutting and slashing them with their  knives. The end of the unfortunates was most horrible. They were ripped  with knives, scalped, and then burned. No doubt, Colonel Brown enjoyed  this scene more thoroughly than he did the tame and commonplace  spectacle of strangling Captain Ashby and his companions.    Before raising the siege, Elijah Clarke paroled the officers and men  whom he had captured,--fifty-six men, all told. This fact is mentioned  to show that the Georgia militia had not then begun those acts of  retaliation which have attracted the notice of historians. They had  had, as we know, abundant provocation; but after the horrible crimes  perpetrated by Brown reached their ears, they threw off all restraint.  Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and the men who acted  with Elijah Clarke thought that the best way to preserve the lives of  themselves and their families was to destroy the Tories as fast as they  caught them. The fact is chronicled by Colonel Jones, and it is worth  noting, that the officers and men paroled by Clarke, in utter disregard  of their obligations, took up their arms as soon as the Americans  had departed. The probability is that they were driven to this by the  commands of Brown.    It is well known, that, as soon as Clarke and his men had retreated,  Colonel Brown sent detachments of troops in all directions, with orders  to arrest all persons who had taken part in the siege, or who had  sympathized with the efforts of the Americans to recapture Augusta.  Under this sweeping order,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#14)"],[1," grass growing around him,  Vidar sat. And near by him a horse grazed with a saddle upon it, a horse  that was ever ready for the speedy journey.    And Odin, now Vegtam the Wanderer, came into that silent place and spoke  to Vidar, the Silent God.    \"O Vidar,\" he said, \"strangest of all my sons; God who will live when  all of us have passed away; God who will bring the memory of the  Dwellers of Asgard into a world that will know not their power; O Vidar,  well do I know why there grazes near by thee the horse ever ready for  the speedy journey: it is that thou mayst spring upon it and ride  unchecked, a son speeding to avenge his father.    \"To you only, O Vidar the Silent One, will I speak of the secrets of my  doings. Who but you can know why I, Odin, the Eldest of the Gods, hung  on the tree Ygdrassil nine days and nine nights, mine own spear  transfixing me? I hung upon that windy tree that I might learn the  wisdom that would give me power in the nine worlds. On the ninth night  the Runes of Wisdom appeared before mine eyes, and slipping down from  the tree I took them to myself.    \"And I shall tell why my ravens fly to thee, carrying in their beaks  scraps of leather. It is that thou mayst make for thyself a sandal; with  that sandal on thou mayst put thy foot on the lower jaw of a mighty wolf  and rend him. All the shoemakers of the earth throw on the ground scraps  of the leather they use so that thou mayst be able to make the sandal  for thy wolf-rending foot.    \"And I have counseled the dwellers on earth to cut off the fingernails  and the toenails of their dead, lest from those fingernails and toenails  the Giants make for themselves the ship Naglfar in which they will sail  from the North on the day of Ragnaroek, the Twilight of the Gods.    \"More, Vidar, I will tell to thee. I, living amongst men, have wed the  daughter of a hero. My son shall live as a mortal amongst mortals. Sigi  his name shall be. From him shall spring heroes who will fill Valhalla,  my own hall in Asgard, with heroes against the day of our strife with  the Giants and with Surtur of the Flaming Sword.\"    For long Odin stayed in that silent place communing with his silent son,  with Vidar, who with his brother would live beyond the lives of the  Dwellers of Asgard and who would bring into another day and another  world the memory of the AEsir and the Vanir. For long Odin spoke with  him, and then he went across the wilderness where the grass and the  bushes grew and where that horse grazed in readiness for the sudden  journey. He went toward the seashore where the AEsir and the Vanir were  now gathered for the feast that old AEgir, the Giant King of the Sea, had  offered them.          [Illustration:]    THOR AND LOKI IN THE GIANTS' CITY      All but a few of the Dwellers of Asgard had come to the feast offered by  AEgir the Old, the Giant King of the Sea. Frigga, the queenly wife of  Odin, was there, and Frey and Freya; Iduna, who guarded the Apples of  Youth, and Bragi, her husband; Tyr, the great swordsman, and Nioerd, the  God of the Sea, Skadi, who wedded Nioerd and whose hatred for Loki was  fierce, and Sif, whose golden hair was once shorn off by Loki the  mischievous. Thor and Loki were there. The Dwellers of Asgard, gathered  together in the hall of AEgir, waited for Odin.    Before Odin came Loki made the company merry by the tales that he told  in mockery of Thor. Loki long since had his lips unloosed from the thong  that the Dwarf Brock had sewn them with. And Thor had forgotten the  wrong that he had done to Sif. Loki had been with Thor in his  wanderings through Joetunheim, and about these wanderings he now told  mocking tales.    He told how he had seen Thor in his chariot of brass drawn by two goats  go across Bifroest, the Rainbow Bridge. None of the AEsir or the Vanir  knew on what adventure Thor was bent. But Loki followed him and Thor  kept him in his company.    As they traveled on in the brass chariot drawn by the two goats, Thor  told Loki of the adventure on which he was bent. He would go into  Joetunheim, even into Utgard, the Giants' City, and he would try his  strength against the Giants. He was not afraid of aught that might  happen, for he carried Mioelnir, his hammer, with him.    Their way was through Midgard, the World of Men. Once, as they were  traveling on, night came upon them as they were hungry and in need of  shelter. They saw a peasant's hut and they drove the chariot toward it.  Unyoking the goats and leaving them standing in a hollow beside the  chariot, the two, looking not like Dwellers in Asgard, but like men  traveling through the country, knocked at the door of the hut and asked  for food and shelter.    They could have shelter, the peasant and his wife told them, but they  could not have food. There was little in that place, and what little  there had been they had eaten for supper. The peasant showed them the  inside of the hut: it was poor and bare, and there was nothing there to  give anyone. In the morning, the peasant said, he would go down to the  river and catch some fish for a meal.    \"We can't wait until morning, we must eat now,\" said Thor, \"and I think  I can provide a good meal for us all.\" He went over to where his goats  stood in the hollow beside the chariot of brass, and, striking them with  his hammer, he left them lifeless on the ground. He skinned the goats  then, and taking up the bones very carefully, he left them down on the  skins. Skins and bones he lifted up and bringing them into the house he  left them in a hole above the peasant's fireplace. \"No one,\" said he in  a commanding voice, \"must touch the bones that I leave here.\"    Then he brought the meat into the house. Soon it was cooked and laid  smoking on the table. The peasant and his wife and his son sat round the  board with Thor and Loki. They had not eaten plentifully for many days,  and now the man and the woman fed themselves well.    Thialfi was the name of the peasant's son. He was a growing lad and had  an appetite that had not been satisfied for long. While the meat was on  the table his father and mother had kept him going here and there,  carrying water, putting fagots on the fire, and holding a blazing stick  so that those at the table might see to eat. There was not much left for  him when he was able to sit down, for Thor and Loki had great appetites,  and the lad's father and mother had eaten to make up for days of want.  So Thialfi got little out of that plentiful feast.    When the meal was finished they lay down on the benches. Thor, because  he had made a long journey that day, slept very soundly. Thialfi lay  down on a bench, too, but his thoughts were still upon the food. When  all were asleep, he thought, he would take one of the bones that were  in the skins above him, and break and gnaw it.    So in the dead of the night the lad stood up on the bench and took down  the goatskins that Thor had left so carefully there. He took out a bone,  broke it, and gnawed it for the marrow. Loki was awake and saw him do  this, but he, relishing mischief as much as ever, did nothing to stay  the lad.    He put the bone he had broken back in the skins and he left the skins  back in the hole above the fireplace. Then he went to sleep on the  bench.    In the morning, as soon as they were up, the first thing Thor did was to  take the skins out of the hole. He carried them carefully out to the  hollow where he had left the goats standing. He put each goatskin down  with the bones in it. He struck each with his hammer, and the goats  sprang up alive, horns and hoofs and all.    But one was not as he had been before. He limped badly. Thor examined  the leg and found out that one bone was broken. In terrible anger he  turned on the peasant, his wife, and his son. \"A bone of this goat has  been broken under your roof,\" he shouted. \"For that I shall destroy your  house and leave you all dead under it.\" Thialfi wept. Then he came  forward and touched the knees of Thor. \"I did not know what harm I did,\"  he said. \"I broke the bone.\"    Thor had his hammer lifted up to crush him into the earth. But he could  not bring it down on the weeping boy. He let his hammer rest on the  ground again. \"You will have to do much service for me for having lamed  my goat,\" he said. \"Come with me.\"    And so the lad Thialfi went off with Thor and Loki. Thor took in his  powerful hands the shafts of the chariot of brass and he dragged it into  a lonely mountain hollow where neither men nor Giants came. And they  left the goats in a great, empty forest to stay resting there until Thor  called to them again.    Thor and Loki and the lad Thialfi went across from Midgard into  Joetunheim. Because of Mioelnir, the great hammer that he carried, Thor  felt safe in the Realm of the Giants. And Loki, who trusted in his own  cunning, felt safe, too. The lad Thialfi trusted in Thor so much that he  had no fear. They were long in making the journey, and while they were  traveling Thor and Loki trained Thialfi to be a quick and a strong lad.    One day they came out on a moor. All day they crossed it, and at night  it still stretched far before them. A great wind was blowing, night was  falling, and they saw no shelter near. In the dusk they saw a shape that  looked to be a mountain and they went toward it, hoping to find some  shelter in a cave.    Then Loki saw a lower shape that looked as if it might be a shelter.  They walked around it, Loki and Thor and the lad Thialfi. It was a  house, but a house most oddly shaped. The entrance was a long, wide hall  that had no doorway. When they entered this hall they found five long  and narrow chambers running off it. \"It is an odd place, but it is the  best shelter we can get,\" Loki said. \"You and I, Thor, will take the  two longest rooms, and the lad Thialfi can take one of the little  rooms.\"    They entered their chambers and they lay down to sleep. But from the  mountain"]]]
