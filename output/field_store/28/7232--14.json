STATE OF IDAHO                              GOVERNOR'S OFFICE,                                    BOISE.                                                  January 22, 1915.              Woman Suffrage has gone beyond the trial stage in            Idaho. We have had it in operation for many years            and it is now thoroughly and satisfactorily            established. Its repeal would not carry a single            county in the State.              The women form an intelligent, patriotic and            energetic element in our politics. They have been            instrumental in accomplishing many needed reforms            along domestic and moral lines, and in creating a            sentiment favorable to the strict enforcement of            the law.              The impression that Woman Suffrage inspires an            ambition in women to seek and hold public office            is altogether wrong. The contrary is true. The            women of Idaho are not politicians, but they            demand faithful and conscientious service from            public officials and when this service is not            rendered their disapproval is certain and            unmistakable.              Woman suffrage produces no wrong or injury to            society, but it does engender a higher spirit of            civic righteousness and places political and            public affairs on a more elevated plane of            morality and responsibility.

Sift flour,  salt, baking powder and rub suet into flour well. Beat eggs lightly, add  milk and stir into mixture. Butter mold and fill 3/4 full and steam  three hours. This quantity makes two good sized puddings.    It is very nice made without the eggs and using one-half the quantity.  Fill a deep pudding dish or pan with fruit, apples or peaches, dropping  the suet pudding over the fruit in large spoonsfull and steam 1 1/2  hours.      Cottage Fruit Pudding              2 teaspoons butter            1 egg            1/4 teaspoon salt            1 cup sugar            1/2 cup milk            1-3/4 cups flour    Cream well together 2 teaspoons butter, 1 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 cup  milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1-3/4 cups flour. Beat well and add two  scant teaspoons baking powder, then turn into shallow, well-buttered  pan, the bottom of which has been covered with fresh fruit of any kind.    Bake in moderate oven one-half hour. Serve with cream or sauce.      Prune Souffle    One-half pound of prunes, three tablespoons of powdered sugar, four  eggs, a small teaspoon of vanilla. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the  sugar to a cream, add the vanilla and mix them with the prunes. The  prunes should first be stewed and drained, the stones removed, and each  prune cut into four pieces. When ready to serve, fold in lightly the  stiffly whipped whites of the eggs, having added a dash of salt to the  whites before whipping.    Turn it into a pudding dish and bake in a moderate oven for 20 minutes.  Serve very hot directly it is taken from the oven.      Plum Pudding              2 lbs. suet            1 lb. sugar            1/2 lb. flour            12 eggs            1 pint milk            2 nutmegs grated            1/4 oz. cloves.            2 lbs. bread crumbs (dry)            2 lbs. raisins            2 lbs. currants            1/4 lb. orange & lemon peel            1 cup brandy            1/2 oz. mace            1/4 oz. allspice    Free suet from strings and chop fine. Seed raisins, chop fine and dredge  with flour. Cream suet and sugar; beat in the yolks when whipped smooth  and light; next put in milk; then flour and crumbs alternately with  beaten whites; then brandy and spice, and lastly the fruit well dredged  with flour. Mix all thoroughly. Take well buttered bowls filled to the  top with the mixture and steam five hours. (This pudding will keep a  long time).    When cold cover with cheesecloth and tie with cord around the rim of the  bowl. Steam again one hour before using. Use wine or brandy sauce. When  on the table pour a little brandy or rum over the top of the pudding and  set fire to it. This adds much to the flavor.      Lemon Cream    Cream together the yolks of five (5) eggs and four (4) tablespoons of  sugar. Add the grated rind of one (1) lemon and the juice of one and  one-half (1 1/2) lemons. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of gelatine in a very  little water, while hot stir into the pudding. Let stand till it  thickens, then add the beaten whites of the eggs.
