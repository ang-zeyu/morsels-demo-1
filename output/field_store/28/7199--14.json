Any blow he could deliver would only  irritate the beast.  And now a dawning feeling of admiration began to  broaden as he gazed at the great, massive head and the huge paws,  recalling the while what he had seen since he had been in South Africa--  a horse's back broken by one blow, the heads of oxen dragged down and  the necks broken by another jerk; and he felt that he would be perfectly  helpless when the brute made its first spring.    And still the lion stood, with the tail swinging in that pendulum-like  motion; the great eyes gazing heavily at him; while during those painful  minutes Dyke's brain grew more and more active.  He thought of mice in  the power of cats, and felt something of the inert helplessness of the  lesser animal, crouching, as if fascinated by the cruel, claw-armed  tyrant, waiting to make its spring.  And he knew that at any moment this  beast might come at him as if discharged from a catapult.  But all the  same the brain grew more and more acute in its endeavours to find him a  way of escape.  If he had only had a short bayonet fixed at the end of  his gun, that he might hold it ready with the butt upon the ground, and  the point at an angle of forty-five degrees, so that the lion might at  its first bound alight upon it, and impale itself, just as it had been  known to do upon the long, sharp, slightly curved prongs of the black  antelope, piercing itself through and through, and meeting the fate  intended for its prey.    But then he had no bayonet at the end of his gun, and no weapon  whatever, but his strong sheath-knife.  He could hold that out before  him; but he knew well enough that he could not hold it rigid enough to  turn it to advantage against his foe.    It might have been so many seconds only, but it appeared to Dyke a long  space of time numbered by minutes, as he waited there, expecting the  great animal to crouch and spring, making short work of him before going  on to gorge itself upon the carcass of the eland.  There was no  possibility of help coming, for it must be hours before Emson could  return, and then it would be too late.    At last the power to move came back, and Dyke's first thought was to  turn and run, but second thoughts suggested that it would be inviting  the great active beast to spring upon his back, and he remained firm,  never for a moment taking his eyes off those which stared so fixedly  into his, although he was longing to look wildly round for the help that  could not be at hand.    Then his heart gave one great leap, for he saw a quiver run through the  lion, which crouched down, gathering its hind-legs beneath it, and  outstretching its fore; but it was some moments before the boy grasped  the fact that the brute's movement was not for the purpose of making a  tremendous bound, but only to couch, as if it would be easier and more  comfortable to gaze at him in a seated position after making a very long  stalk.    \"He can't be hungry!\" came to Dyke's brain on the instant, and then boy  and lion sat opposite to each other, gazing hard, till the great cat's  head and mane seemed to swell and swell to gigantic proportions before  the boy's swimming eyes, and they appeared misty, strange, and distant.    Then came another change, for the animal suddenly threw itself over,  stretched, and turned upon its back, patted at the air with its paw, and  gazed at the boy in an upside-down position, its lower jaw uppermost,  but keeping a watchful eye upon him, as if expecting an attack.  A  moment or two later it was drawing itself over the sand to where Dyke  sat, and made a quick dab at him with one paw, striking up the sand in a  shower; and as the boy started away, the brute sprang to its feet, shook  itself, and with two or three bounds plumped itself down upon the eland,  and buried its teeth in the dead antelope's throat.    Dyke uttered a hoarse sigh of relief, and rested himself by pressing his  hands down beside him, breathing heavily the while.    It was a temporary reprieve, but he dared not move for fear of drawing  the attention of the lion to him, and clung to the hope that perhaps the  great creature might be content to glut itself upon the game.    The beast was well-fed and not savage, that was plain enough, but its  action might change at any moment, and, worse still, there was the  prospect of others arriving at any moment to join in the feast.    For a full hour Dyke sat there, watching the great animal, and listening  to it as it tore off pieces of the neck from time to time, the crack of  a bone every now and then making him start violently, and shudder at the  thought of certain possibilities connected with himself.  And all this  time the beast was in such a position that one eye was toward him, and a  gleam therefrom made it apparent that he was carefully watched the whole  time.  But at last the lion turned itself more away to get at a more  meaty portion, and a thrill of excitement ran through Dyke.    Grasping his knife firmly in one hand, his gun in the other, he turned  over, and fixing upon one of the low bushes a short distance away,  beyond which was other good cover, he began slowly and silently to crawl  sidewise away, keeping a watchful eye the while upon the lion, so as to  stop short at the slightest movement on the part of the great beast.    It was an exceedingly difficult mode of progression, and it was hard  work to keep to it, for with every yard the desire to get up and run  toward where Breezy would be grazing increased.  Once he could reach the  cob, take off the hobbles which confined its forefeet, tighten the  girths, and slip the bit between its teeth, he did not care.  But there  was a great deal to do, he knew, before he could achieve this.    Yard by yard he crept on, the sand hushing every sound, and he had  nearly reached the low bush cropped short all over the top by the horse  or some passing animal, when there was a quick movement and a low growl  which made him feel that all was over.    But a sharp _crick, crack_ of a broken bone nipped in the powerful jaws  reassured him, and after waiting a few minutes, he crept sidewise again  a little farther, and he was behind the bush, which shut out all view of  the lion and smouldering fire, and of course hid him from his enemy.    He could now make better progress, for if the lion turned, he would be  invisible; and taking advantage of this, he crept on from bush to bush,  till he was quite a hundred yards away.  And now the longing was intense  to stand erect and look out for Breezy, but the bushy growth had been so  closely cropped that it was nowhere a yard in height, and to stand up  might have meant to bring him full in his enemy's sight.    There was nothing to be done, then, but to crawl on to a more open spot,  and as he was going in the direction taken by the horse in feeding the  last time he saw it, the boy felt not the slightest uneasiness, being  sure that he should come in sight of it directly.    Still the minutes glided on as he made for the more open part where the  sand lay bare, and he began now to grow uneasy at not seeing the cob,  and at last, like a crushing disaster, he saw that the poor animal must  have scented the lion, or been alarmed at the cracking of the bones,  and, in consequence, it had quietly shuffled as far away as it could in  the time.  There it was, a couple of miles away, right in the open  plain, and though at that distance its movement could not be made out,  it was in all probability shuffling its way along to save its life.    Dyke's heart sank in his breast as he knelt there in the sand, feeling  as if his case was as hopeless as ever, and for the moment he felt  disposed to creep right into the densest place he could find, and lie  there till darkness set in, when he would take his bearings as well as  he could from the stars, and then try to reach Kopfontein.  But at that  moment there came to him his brother's words, and the little absurd  story about trying till to-morrow morning.  A trifling thing; but at  that moment enough to make Dyke sling his gun over his back, thrust the  knife into its sheaf, mark down the position of the fire by the faint  smoke, and then start off crawling on all-fours straight away, not after  the horse, but so as to keep the bushes well between him and the lion.    The exertion was great and the heat terrible.  Never had the sand seemed  so hot before, nor the air so stifling to breathe; but he crept on  silently and pretty quickly, till, glancing back over his shoulder, he  found that he might move straight at once to where he could see Breezy  looking distant and misty through the lowest stratum of the quivering  air.  For the low bushes hid him no longer; there was the faint smoke of  the fire still rising, and just beyond it the big carcass of the eland,  made monstrous by the great maned lion, crouching, tearing at the neck.    At the sight of this, Dyke dropped down flat, and lay panting and  motionless for a few minutes.  Then he began to crawl straight for the  horse, grovelling along upon his breast.  But this soon proved to be far  too painful and laborious a mode of progression, and he rose to his  hands and knees, feeling that it must be that way or nohow, though fast  growing desperate enough to rise to his feet and run.    A minute's anxious reflection brought the feeling that this would be a  mad act, and might rouse the lion into following him, so he kept  steadily getting farther and farther away, and more and more  foreshortened, as the artists term it, till he was pretty well end on to  the lion, and he felt that he must present a singular aspect to the  monster if it looked across the plain.    \"I shall never do it,\" muttered Dyke.  \"Poor old Breezy! he was  frightened.  I can't blame him, but I don't get any nearer.  He's going  on as fast as I am, and I shall be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#14)"],[1,"hoofs would sink into the sand up to the ankles, and it  would be hard work for him to go even a mile. But a camel's foot is  different. It has a _soft pad of muscles_ under it, just like a  cushion; and when the camel walks or runs on the sand, the pad spreads  out under his foot, and that gives him a firm hold on the sand in  walking or running. So remember that the camel has padded feet.    I must tell you here that the feet of all animals are formed in the  way they can best use, in the country in which they live. Those  animals that have to walk on _hard ground_ have _hoofs_, and those  that have to walk on _soft ground_ have _padded feet_. The elephant is  the only animal that has to walk on hard ground, at least very often,  and yet has padded feet. Can you tell why? Because of his huge weight!  He is so heavy that if the bones under his feet were not covered with  a thick pad, he would jar the bones every time he put his foot down,  even if the ground were not very hard.    In the same way the camel's padded foot is very useful to him even  when he is not in the desert, but on hard ground; for he too is  rather heavy, though of course not so heavy as an elephant.    [Illustration: Sand Storm in the Desert]    There are other reasons why no other animal could cross a desert as  easily as a camel. In the desert there are sometimes fierce storms;  and as it is all sand there, the strong wind blows the sand about in  every direction. As there is no place there where one could get away  from the sand, any other animal would soon have a lot of sand blown  into his nostrils; then he would be choked. But a camel's nostrils are  made differently, so that whenever he likes he can _close his  nostrils_, as easily as you can close your mouths, and that keeps away  the sand. The camel is clever enough to lie down on the ground when a  storm is blowing, and to lay his neck and chin along the ground; then  his nose is quite close to the ground, where the storm is not quite so  fierce as in the air.    Of course, when he wants to breathe, he opens his nostrils a tiny bit  to take in a little air; then he closes the nostrils again, and holds  his breath for a little while. He has to keep on doing that as long as  the storm lasts.    But what does his master do, who has been riding on his back? He  cannot close his nostrils; so the only thing he can do is to get off  the camel and huddle against the camel's body on the side far from the  wind; then he brings his face quite close to the ground and holds his  nose with his hand. When he wants to breathe, he opens his fingers  just enough to make a slit and let the _air_ in, but not enough to let  the _sand_ in.    There is another reason why no other animal could cross a desert: his  eyes would be blinded by the fierce glare of the sun. But a camel has  very _thick hair on his eyebrows_, which hang over the eyes, and keep  off the fierce rays of the sun. His eyelashes also are very thick, and  help to keep off the sun in the same way.    But there is a still more wonderful reason why no other animal, except  a camel, could cross a desert. In a desert water is very scarce, and a  traveler crossing a desert on a camel may not find any water for a  whole week. Of course, he carries on his saddle half a dozen bottles  of water to drink; but after drinking some of the water each day, he  has not much to spare for the poor camel. Then what is the poor camel  to do?    Of course, you may say that his master should carry more water for the  camel to drink. But the load of goods which the camel has to carry is  already so heavy that there is not much room for any more water. Then  what _can_ the poor camel do?    Why, he _carries his own drinking water_, not in the load on his back,  but _inside his stomach_! Is not that a wonderful thing? His stomach  is made differently from that of any other animal. The stomach of any  other animal, Or even a man's stomach, is so made that the water drunk  at any time is all used up in the next few hours; that is why any  other animal, or even a man, has to have another drink after those few  hours.    But a camel's stomach is so made that it has one big place for food  and drink like the stomach of any other animal, but it also has many  smaller places arranged all around the stomach; these smaller places  are just like bottles, and are called _cells_.    So when a camel takes a good long drink, the big place in the middle  of the stomach takes in the water first; then as he drinks more and  more, the bottles or cells all around begin to get filled also. And  the wonderful thing is that as soon as each cell is full, its mouth  closes up by itself! In that way, if the camel drinks long enough, all  the cells get full, one by one, and then have their mouths closed up.    When a camel is about to start on a long journey through the desert,  he takes a very long drink, till he _feels_ that he cannot drink any  more; then he _knows_ that all the bottles or cells inside are quite  full, as well as the big place in the middle of his stomach. Now he is  ready to cross the desert.    After many hours all the water in the big place in the middle of the  stomach gets used up. Then what happens? Why, one of the bottles  inside opens its mouth by itself, and pours the water into the  stomach! And after many hours more, when _that_ water has also been  used up, the _second_ bottle opens its mouth and pours the water into  the stomach. In this way all the bottles or cells inside the camel one  by one pour their water into the stomach from day to day, whenever the  camel feels thirsty. Is not that most wonderful?    And there is yet another very wonderful thing about the camel. His  hump! It is just as wonderful whether it is one hump or two humps. I  shall tell you.    The camel's hump is his _store of food_! Yes, just as he carries his  own drinking water inside his stomach, so he also carries his own  store of food in his hump.    This is how he does it:    When the camel is quite well and strong, if he eats any food which is  a little more than he actually needs for his hunger, that food after a  while goes to his hump and helps to make it bigger. In this way the  hump becomes a store of all the extra food that he has eaten. Then, on  going on a long journey through the desert, if the camel has nothing  to eat and begins to feel hungry and weak, a little of the hump is  used up to give him strength, just as if he were to eat a meal. In  this way he can go for many days without food, but of course his hump  will get smaller and smaller.    [Illustration: Crossing the Desert with Camels]    But his master does not actually take him through the desert without  giving him _any_ food or drink; in fact he always gives the camel some  of the figs and dates which he takes with him for his own meals, and  also some of the drinking water which he carries on his saddle. But if  it did happen that his master had no food or drink to spare, the camel  could still live for several days, using his hump for food, and the  water in the cells of his stomach for drink.    The camel can do yet another wonderful thing. He can tell a long way  off when he is coming to a place where there is water. In the desert,  after going over sand and sand for many days, a traveler sometimes  finds a beautiful place called an _oasis_. It is just like a lovely  little garden right in the middle of the desert, with a spring of  water, and several fig trees, date trees, and other palm trees growing  all around the pool.    When a traveler is crossing the desert and sees nothing but sand for  several days, it sometimes happens that his camel suddenly stops,  stands quite still for a minute, raises his head, and sniffs the air.  Then he turns a little to the right or to the left, and begins to run  straight that way. His master may look ahead very hard, but he will  see nothing but sand and sand, as before.    But the camel, by just sniffing the air, has found out that there is  an oasis within reach, though it is still too far away for him to see  it. Then he runs on most gladly, and comes to the oasis in an hour, so  that he and his master can rest there for some time, and drink from  the pool, and eat the figs and dates growing on the trees.    Of course, the camel can also eat the leaves of the trees; in fact,  when he is not in the desert, but just in the ordinary country, he  usually eats from the shrubs and bushes, and gets figs and dates only  as a dainty, just as you sometimes have ice cream. The camel with two  humps will gladly eat many more things than the camel with one hump.  In fact, when he is hungry, he will eat not only any kind of  vegetable, but also meat. He has even been known to chew up and eat  bones, blankets, and leather! And he is perhaps the _only animal that  will drink salt water_; for the country in which the Two-Humps camel  lives has several lakes, the water of which is bitter and salty.    So you see how useful an animal the camel is, whether he has one hump  or two humps. He is so useful that people have been saying for a long  time that camels should be brought into America, where there are  several deserts in the western states. In fact, a strange thing has  already happened. The United States Government did bring a lot of  camels for use in the western states several years ago, about the time  when your grandfather was a boy.    But the people who can best manage such large animals as elephants and  camels are the people who are born in the same countries as those  animals and who understand their habits. And unluckily, when the  camels were brought into America, nobody thought of bringing men also  from those countries to manage the camels. So nobody seemed to know  how to use these animals, and after a time they were turned loose in  Arizona. The camels went into the deserts and forests there, and  became quite wild, and to-day there are some of them"]]]
