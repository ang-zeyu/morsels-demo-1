And so Darnell had somehow been led into  conceiving the lady of this demesne as a personage of no small pomp. He  saw her, tall, of dignified port and presence, inclining, it might be,  to some measure of obesity, such a measure as was not unbefitting in an  elderly lady of position, who lived well and lived at ease. He even  imagined a slight ruddiness of complexion, which went very well with  hair that was beginning to turn grey, and when he heard the door-bell  ring, as he sat under the mulberry on the Sunday afternoon, he bent  forward to catch sight of this stately figure, clad, of course, in the  richest, blackest silk, girt about with heavy chains of gold.    He started with amazement when he saw the strange presence that followed  the servant into the garden. Mrs. Nixon was a little, thin old woman,  who bent as she feebly trotted after Alice; her eyes were on the ground,  and she did not lift them when the Darnells rose to greet her. She  glanced to the right, uneasily, as she shook hands with Darnell, to the  left when Mary kissed her, and when she was placed on the garden seat  with a cushion at her back, she looked away at the back of the houses in  the next street. She was dressed in black, it was true, but even Darnell  could see that her gown was old and shabby, that the fur trimming of her  cape and the fur boa which was twisted about her neck were dingy and  disconsolate, and had all the melancholy air which fur wears when it is  seen in a second-hand clothes-shop in a back street. And her  gloves--they were black kid, wrinkled with much wear, faded to a bluish  hue at the finger-tips, which showed signs of painful mending. Her hair,  plastered over her forehead, looked dull and colourless, though some  greasy matter had evidently been used with a view of producing a  becoming gloss, and on it perched an antique bonnet, adorned with black  pendants that rattled paralytically one against the other.    And there was nothing in Mrs. Nixon's face to correspond with the  imaginary picture that Darnell had made of her. She was sallow,  wrinkled, pinched; her nose ran to a sharp point, and her red-rimmed  eyes were a queer water-grey, that seemed to shrink alike from the light  and from encounter with the eyes of others. As she sat beside his wife  on the green garden-seat, Darnell, who occupied a wicker-chair brought  out from the drawing-room, could not help feeling that this shadowy and  evasive figure, muttering replies to Mary's polite questions, was almost  impossibly remote from his conceptions of the rich and powerful aunt,  who could give away a hundred pounds as a mere birthday gift. She would  say little at first; yes, she was feeling rather tired, it had been so  hot all the way, and she had been afraid to put on lighter things as  one never knew at this time of year what it might be like in the  evenings; there were apt to be cold mists when the sun went down, and  she didn't care to risk bronchitis.    'I thought I should never get here,' she went on, raising her voice to  an odd querulous pipe. 'I'd no notion it was such an out-of-the-way  place, it's so many years since I was in this neighbourhood.'    She wiped her eyes, no doubt thinking of the early days at Turnham  Green, when she married Nixon; and when the pocket-handkerchief had done  its office she replaced it in a shabby black bag which she clutched  rather than carried. Darnell noticed, as he watched her, that the bag  seemed full, almost to bursting, and he speculated idly as to the nature  of its contents: correspondence, perhaps, he thought, further proofs of  Uncle Robert's treacherous and wicked dealings. He grew quite  uncomfortable, as he sat and saw her glancing all the while furtively  away from his wife and himself, and presently he got up and strolled  away to the other end of the garden, where he lit his pipe and walked to  and fro on the gravel walk, still astounded at the gulf between the real  and the imagined woman.    Presently he heard a hissing whisper, and he saw Mrs. Nixon's head  inclining to his wife's. Mary rose and came towards him.    'Would you mind sitting in the drawing-room, Edward?' she murmured.  'Aunt says she can't bring herself to discuss such a delicate matter  before you. I dare say it's quite natural.'    'Very well, but I don't think I'll go into the drawing-room. I feel as  if a walk would do me good. You mustn't be frightened if I am a little  late,' he said; 'if I don't get back before your aunt goes, say good-bye  to her for me.'    He strolled into the main road, where the trams were humming to and fro.  He was still confused and perplexed, and he tried to account for a  certain relief he felt in removing himself from the presence of Mrs.  Nixon. He told himself that her grief at her husband's ruffianly conduct  was worthy of all pitiful respect, but at the same time, to his shame,  he had felt a certain physical aversion from her as she sat in his  garden in her dingy black, dabbing her red-rimmed eyes with a damp  pocket-handkerchief. He had been to the Zoo when he was a lad, and he  still remembered how he had shrunk with horror at the sight of certain  reptiles slowly crawling over one another in their slimy pond. But he  was enraged at the similarity between the two sensations, and he walked  briskly on that level and monotonous road, looking about him at the  unhandsome spectacle of suburban London keeping Sunday.    There was something in the tinge of antiquity which still exists in  Acton that soothed his mind and drew it away from those unpleasant  contemplations, and when at last he had penetrated rampart after rampart  of brick, and heard no more the harsh shrieks and laughter of the people  who were enjoying themselves, he found a way into a little sheltered  field, and sat down in peace beneath a tree, whence he could look out on  a pleasant valley. The sun sank down beneath the hills, the clouds  changed into the likeness of blossoming rose-gardens; and he still sat  there in the gathering darkness till a cool breeze blew upon him, and  he rose with a sigh, and turned back to the brick ramparts and the  glimmering streets, and the noisy idlers sauntering to and fro in the  procession of their dismal festival. But he was murmuring to himself  some words that seemed a magic song, and it was with uplifted heart that  he let himself into his house.    Mrs. Nixon had gone an hour and a half before his return, Mary told him.  Darnell sighed with relief, and he and his wife strolled out into the  garden and sat down side by side.    They kept silence for a time, and at last Mary spoke, not without a  nervous tremor in her voice.    'I must tell you, Edward,' she began, 'that aunt has made a proposal  which you ought to hear. I think we should consider it.'    'A proposal? But how about the whole affair? Is it still going on?'    'Oh, yes! She told me all about it. Uncle is quite unrepentant. It seems  he has taken a flat somewhere in town for that woman, and furnished it  in the most costly manner. He simply laughs at aunt's reproaches, and  says he means to have some fun at last. You saw how broken she was?'    'Yes; very sad. But won't he give her any money? Wasn't she very badly  dressed for a woman in her position?'    'Aunt has no end of beautiful things, but I fancy she likes to hoard  them; she has a horror of spoiling her dresses. It isn't for want of  money, I assure you, as uncle settled a very large sum on her two years  ago, when he was everything that could be desired as a husband. And that  brings me to what I want to say. Aunt would like to live with us. She  would pay very liberally. What do you say?'    'Would like to live with us?' exclaimed Darnell, and his pipe dropped  from his hand on to the grass. He was stupefied by the thought of Aunt  Marian as a boarder, and sat staring vacantly before him, wondering what  new monster the night would next produce.    'I knew you wouldn't much like the idea,' his wife went on. 'But I do  think, dearest, that we ought not to refuse without very serious  consideration. I am afraid you did not take to poor aunt very much.'    Darnell shook his head dumbly.    'I thought you didn't; she was so upset, poor thing, and you didn't see  her at her best. She is really so good. But listen to me, dear. Do you  think we have the right to refuse her offer? I told you she has money of  her own, and I am sure she would be dreadfully offended if we said we  wouldn't have her. And what would become of me if anything happened to  you? You know we have very little saved.'    Darnell groaned.    'It seems to me,' he said, 'that it would spoil everything. We are so  happy, Mary dear, by ourselves. Of course I am extremely sorry for your  aunt. I think she is very much to be pitied. But when it comes to having  her always here----'    'I know, dear. Don't think I am looking forward to the prospect; you  know I don't want anybody but you. Still, we ought to think of the  future, and besides we shall be able to live so very much better. I  shall be able to give you all sorts of nice things that I know you ought  to have after all that hard work in the City. Our income would be  doubled.'    'Do you mean she would pay us L150 a year?'    'Certainly. And she would pay for the spare room being furnished, and  any extra she might want. She told me, specially, that if a friend or  two came now and again to see her, she would gladly bear the cost of a  fire in the drawing-room, and give something towards the gas bill, with  a few shillings for the girl for any additional trouble. We should  certainly be more than twice as well off as we are now. You see, Edward,  dear, it's not the sort of offer we are likely to have again. Besides,  we must think of the future, as I said. Do you know aunt took a great  fancy to you?'

Yet his lips called continually  and his voice grew shrill and dry-sounding, like the voice of far-flying  water-fowl. As he cried, wandering blindly, the water birds flocking  around him peered curiously at him, calling meanwhile to their comrades.  But wise though he was of all speeches, and their meanings plain to him,  yet none told him the way to his country and people.    Now the Duck heard his cry and it was like her own. She was of all  regions the traveller and searcher, knowing all the ways, whether above  or below the waters, whether in the north, the west, the south, or the  east, and was the most knowing of all creatures. Thus the wisdom of the  one understood the knowledge of the other.    And the All-wise cried to her, \"The mountains are white and the valleys;  all plains are like others in whiteness, and even the light of our  Father the Sun, makes all ways more hidden of whiteness! In brightness  my eyes see but darkness.\"    The Duck answered:    \"Think no longer sad thoughts. Thou hearest all as I see all. Give me  tinkling shells from thy girdle and place them on my neck and in my  beak. I may guide thee with my seeing if thou hear and follow my trail.  Well I know the way to thy country. Each year I lead thither the wild  geese and the cranes who flee there as winter follows.\"    So the All-wise placed his talking shells on the neck of the Duck, and  the singing shells in her beak, and though painfully and lamely, yet he  followed the sound she made with the shells. From place to place with  swift flight she sped, then awaiting him, ducking her head that the  shells might call loudly. By and by they came to the country of thick  rains and mists on the borders of the Snow World, and passed from water  to water, until wider water lay in their path. In vain the Duck called  and jingled the shells from the midst of the waters. K-yak-lu could  neither swim nor fly as could the Duck.    Now the Rainbow-worm was near in that land of mists and waters and he  heard the sound of the sacred shells.    \"These be my grandchildren,\" he said, and called, \"Why mourn ye? Give me  plumes of the spaces. I will bear you on my shoulders.\"    Then the All-wise took two of the lightest plumewands, and the Duck her  two strong feathers. And he fastened them together and breathed on them  while the Rainbow-worm drew near. The Rainbow unbent himself that  K-yak-lu might mount, then he arched himself high among the clouds. Like  an arrow he straightened himself forward, and followed until his face  looked into the Lake of the Ancients. And there the All-wise descended,  and sat there alone, in the plain beyond the mountains. The Duck had  spread her wings in flight to the south to take counsel of the gods.    Then the Duck, even as the gods had directed, prepared a litter of poles  and reeds, and before the morning came, with the litter they went,  singing a quaint and pleasant song, down the northern plain. And when  they found the All-wise, he looked upon them in the starlight and wept.  But the father of the gods stood over him and chanted the sad dirge  rite. Then K-yak-lu sat down in the great soft litter they bore for him.    They lifted it upon their shoulders, bearing it lightly, singing loudly  as they went, to the shores of the deep black lake, where gleamed from  the middle the lights of the dead.    Out over the magic ladder of rushes and canes which reared itself over  the water, they bore him. And K-yak-lu, scattering sacred prayer meal  before him, stepped down the way, slowly, like a blind man. No sooner  had he taken four steps than the ladder lowered into the deep. And the  All-wise entered the council room of the gods.    The gods sent out their runners, to summon all beings, and called in  dancers for the Dance of Good. And with these came the little ones who  had sunk beneath the waters, well and beautiful and all seemingly clad  in cotton mantles and precious neck jewels.          The Boy Who Became A God  Navajo (New Mexico)    The Tolchini, a clan of the Navajos, lived at Wind Mountains. One of  them used to take long visits into the country. His brothers thought he  was crazy. The first time on his return, he brought with him a pine  bough; the second time, corn. Each time he returned he brought something  new and had a strange story to tell. His brothers said: \"He is crazy. He  does not know what he is talking about.\"    Now the Tolchini left Wind Mountains and went to a rocky foothill east  of the San Mateo Mountain. They had nothing to eat but seed grass. The  eldest brother said, \"Let us go hunting,\" but they told the youngest  brother not to leave camp. But five days and five nights passed, and  there was no word. So he followed them.    After a day's travel he camped near a canon, in a cavelike place. There  was much snow but no water so he made a fire and heated a rock, and made  a hole in the ground. The hot rock heated the snow and gave him water to  drink. Just then he heard a tumult over his head, like people passing.  He went out to see what made the noise and saw many crows crossing back  and forth over the canon. This was the home of the crow, but there were  other feathered people there, and the chaparral cock. He saw many fires  made by the crows on each side of the caeon. Two crows flew down near  him and the youth listened to hear what was the matter.    The two crows cried out, \"Somebody says. Somebody says.\"    The youth did not know what to make of this.    A crow on the opposite side called out, \"What is the matter? Tell us!  Tell us! What is wrong?\"    The first two cried out, \"Two of us got killed. We met two of our men  who told us.\"    Then they told the crows how two men who were out hunting killed twelve  deer, and a party of the Crow People went to the deer after they were  shot. They said, \"Two of us who went after the blood of the deer were  shot.\"    The crows on the other side of the caeon called, \"Which men got killed?\"    \"The chaparral cock, who sat on the horn of the deer, and the crow who  sat on its backbone.\"    The others called out, \"We are not surprised they were killed. That is  what we tell you all the time. If you go after dead deer you must expect  to be killed.\"    \"We will not think of them longer,\" so the two crows replied. \"They are  dead and gone. We are talking of things of long ago.\"    But the youth sat quietly below and listened to everything that was  said.    After a while the crows on the other side of the canon made a great  noise and began to dance. They had many songs at that time. The youth  listened all the time. After the dance a great fire was made and he  could see black objects moving, but he could not distinguish any people.  He recognized the voice of Hasjelti. He remembered everything in his  heart. He even remembered the words of the songs that continued all  night. He remembered every word of every song. He said to himself, \"I  will listen until daylight.\"    The Crow People did not remain on the side of the canon where the fires  were first built. They crossed and recrossed the canon in their dance.  They danced back and forth until daylight. Then all the crows and the  other birds flew away to the west. All that was left was the fires and  the smoke.    Then the youth started for his brothers' camp. They saw him coming. They  said, \"He will have lots of stories to tell. He will say he saw  something no one ever saw.\"    But the brother-in-law who was with them said, \"Let him alone. When he  comes into camp he will tell us all. I believe these things do happen  for he could not make up these things all the time.\"    Now the camp was surrounded by pinon brush and a large fire was burning  in the centre. There was much meat roasting over the fire. When the  youth reached the camp, he raked over the coals and said. \"I feel cold.\"    Brother-in-law replied, \"It is cold. When people camp together, they  tell stories to one another in the morning. We have told ours, now you  tell yours.\"    The youth said, \"Where I stopped last night was the worst camp I ever  had.\" The brothers paid no attention but the brother-in-law listened.    The youth said, \"I never heard such a noise.\" Then he told his story.  Brother-in-law asked what kind of people made the noise.    The youth said, \"I do not know. They were strange people to me, but they  danced all night back and forth across the canon and I heard them say my  brothers killed twelve deer and afterwards killed two of their people  who went for the blood of the deer. I heard them say, 'That is what  must be expected. If you go to such places, you must expect to be  killed.'\"    The elder brother began thinking. He said, \"How many deer did you say  were killed?\"    \"Twelve.\"    Elder brother said, \"I never believed you before, but this story I do  believe. How do you find out all these things? What is the matter with  you that you know them?\"    The boy said, \"I do not know. They come into my mind and to my eyes.\"    Then they started homeward, carrying the meat. The youth helped them.    As they were descending a mesa, they sat down on the edge to rest. Far  down the mesa were four mountain sheep. The brothers told the youth to  kill one.    The youth hid in the sage brush and when the sheep came directly toward  him, he aimed his arrow at them. But his arm stiffened and became dead.  The sheep passed by.    He headed them off again by hiding in the stalks of a large yucca. The  sheep passed within five steps of him, but again his arm stiffened as he  drew the bow.    He followed the sheep and got ahead of them and hid behind a birch tree  in bloom. He had his bow ready, but as they neared him they became gods.  The first was Hasjelti, the second was Hostjoghon, the third Naaskiddi,  and the fourth Hadatchishi. Then the youth fell senseless to the ground."]]]
