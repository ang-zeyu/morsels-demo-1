With great heavings and  throes, with snortings and bellowings, with scratchings and tearings of  its great claws and lashings of its terrible tail, it writhed and  fought to be free, and the light of thousands of fireworks illuminated  the gigantic struggle.    Then what Philip had known would happen, did happen. The great wall held  fast, the rope held fast, the dragon held fast. It was the key that gave  way. With an echoing grinding rusty sound like a goods train shunting on  a siding, the key was drawn from the keyhole in the dragon's side and  left still fast to its rope like an anchor to a cable.    _Left._ For now that happened which Philip had not foreseen. He had  forgotten that before it fell asleep the dragon had partly wound itself  up. And its struggles had not used up all the winding. There was go in  the dragon yet. And with a yell of fury it set off across the plain,  wriggling its green rattling length towards--the Princess.    And now there was no time to think whether one was afraid or not. Philip  went down those tower stairs more quickly than he had ever gone down  stairs in his life, and he was not bad at stairs even at ordinary times.    He put his sword over his shoulder as you do a gun, and ran. Like the  dragon he made straight for the Princess. And now it was a race between  him and the dragon. Philip ran and ran. His heart thumped, his feet had  that leaden feeling that comes in nightmares. He felt as if he were  dying.    Keep on, keep on, faster, faster, you mustn't stop. Ah! that's better.  He has got his second wind. He is going faster. And the dragon, or is it  fancy? is going not quite so fast.    How he did it Philip never knew. But with a last spurt he reached the  pillar where the Princess stood bound. And the dragon was twenty yards  away, coming on and on and on.    Philip stood quite still, recovering his breath. And more and more  slowly, but with no sign of stopping, the dragon came on. Behind him,  where the pillar was, Philip heard some one crying softly.    Then the dragon was quite near. Philip took three steps forward, took  aim with his sword, shut his eyes and hit as hard as he could. Then  something hard and heavy knocked him over, and for a time he knew no  more.          .       .       .       .       .       .       .    When he came to himself again, Mr. Noah was giving him something nasty  to drink out of a medicine glass, Mr. Perrin was patting him on the  back, all the people were shouting like mad, and more fireworks than  ever were being let off. Beside him lay the dragon, lifeless and still.    [Illustration: Then something hard and heavy knocked him over.]    'Oh!' said Philip, 'did I really do it?'    'You did indeed,' said Mr. Noah; 'however you may succeed with the other  deeds, you are the hero of this one. And now, if you feel well enough,  prepare to receive the reward of Valour and Chivalry.'    'Oh!' said Philip, brightening, 'I didn't know there was to be a  reward.'    'Only the usual one,' said Mr Noah. 'The Princess, you know.'    Philip became aware that a figure in a white veil was standing quite  near him; round its feet lay lengths of cut rope.    'The Princess is yours,' said Mr. Noah, with generous affability.    'But I don't want her,' said Philip, adding by an afterthought, 'thank  you.'    'You should have thought of that before,' said Mr. Noah. 'You can't go  doing deeds of valour, you know, and then shirking the reward. Take her.  She is yours.'    'Any one who likes may have her,' said Philip desperately. 'If she's  mine, I can give her away, can't I? You must see yourself I can't be  bothered with princesses if I've got all those other deeds to do.'    'That's not my affair,' said Mr. Noah. 'Perhaps you might arrange to  board her out while you're doing your deeds. But at present she is  waiting for you to take her by the hand and raise her veil.'    'Must I?' said Philip miserably. 'Well, here goes.'    He took a small cold hand in one of his and with the other lifted, very  gingerly, a corner of the veil. The other hand of the Princess drew back  the veil, and the Dragon-Slayer and the Princess were face to face.    'Why!' cried Philip, between relief and disgust, 'it's only Lucy!'          CHAPTER V    ON THE CARPET      The Princess was just Lucy.    'It's too bad,' said Philip. 'I do think.' Then he stopped short and  just looked cross.    'The Princess and the Champion will now have their teas,' said Mr. Noah.  'Right about face, everybody, please, and quick march.'    Philip and Lucy found themselves marching side by side through the night  made yellow with continuous fireworks.    You must picture them marching across a great plain of grass where many  coloured flowers grew. You see a good many of Philip's buildings had  been made on the drawing-room carpet at home, which was green with pink  and blue and yellow and white flowers. And this carpet had turned into  grass and growing flowers, following that strange law which caused  things to change into other things, like themselves, but larger and  really belonging to a living world.    No one spoke. Philip said nothing because he was in a bad temper. And if  you are in a bad temper, nothing is a good thing to say. To circumvent a  dragon and then kill it, and to have such an adventure end in tea with  Lucy, was too much. And he had other reasons for silence too. And Lucy  was silent because she had so much to say that she didn't know where to  begin; and besides, she could feel how cross Philip was. The crowd did  not talk because it was not etiquette to talk when taking part in  processions. Mr. Noah did not talk because it made him out of breath to  walk and talk at the same time, two things neither of which he had been  designed to do.    So that it was quite a silent party which at last passed through the  gateway of the town and up its streets.    Philip wondered where the tea would be--not in the prison of course. It  was very late for tea, too, quite the middle of the night it seemed. But  all the streets were brilliantly lighted, and flags and festoons of  flowers hung from all the windows and across all the streets.    It was in the front of a big building in one of the great squares of the  city that an extra display of coloured lamps disclosed open doors and  red-carpeted steps. Mr. Noah hurried up them, and turned to receive  Philip and Lucy.    'The City of Polistopolis,' he said, 'whose unworthy representative I  am, greets in my person the most noble Sir Philip, Knight and Slayer of  the Dragon. Also the Princess whom he has rescued. Be pleased to enter.'    They went up the red-cloth covered steps and into a hall, very splendid  with silver and ivory. Mr. Noah stooped to a confidential question.    'You'd like a wash, perhaps?' he said, 'and your Princess too. And  perhaps you'd like to dress up a little? Before the banquet, you know.'    'Banquet?' said Philip. 'I thought it was tea.'    'Business before pleasure,' said Mr. Noah; 'first the banquet, then the  tea. This way to the dressing-rooms.'    There were two doors side by side. On one door was painted 'Knight's  dressing-room,' on the other 'Princess's dressing-room.'    'Look out,' said Mr. Noah; 'the paint is wet. You see there wasn't much  time.'    Philip found his dressing-room very interesting. The walls were entirely  of looking-glass, and on tables in the middle of the room lay all sorts  of clothes of beautiful colours and odd shapes. Shoes, stockings, hats,  crowns, armour, swords, cloaks, breeches, waistcoats, jerkins, trunk  hose. An open door showed a marble bath-room. The bath was sunk in the  floor as the baths of luxurious Roman Empresses used to be, and as  nowadays baths sometimes are, in model dwellings. (Only I am told that  some people keep their coals in the baths--which is quite useless  because coals are always black however much you wash them.)    Philip undressed and went into the warm clear water, greenish between  the air and the marble. Why is it so pleasant to have a bath, and so  tiresome to wash your hands and face in a basin? He put on his shirt and  knickerbockers again, and wandered round the room looking at the clothes  laid out there, and wondering which of the wonderful costumes would be  really suitable for a knight to wear at a banquet. After considerable  hesitation he decided on a little soft shirt of chain-mail that made  just a double handful of tiny steel links as he held it. But a  difficulty arose.    'I don't know how to put it on,' said Philip; 'and I expect the banquet  is waiting. How cross it'll be.'    He stood undecided, holding the chain mail in his hands, when his eyes  fell on a bell handle. Above it was an ivory plate, and on it in black  letters the word Valet. Philip rang the bell.    Instantly a soft tap at the door heralded the entrance of a person whom  Philip at the first glance supposed to be a sandwich man. But the second  glance showed that the oblong flat things which he wore were not  sandwich-boards, but dominoes. The person between them bowed low.    'Oh!' said Philip, 'I rang for the valet.'    'I am not the valet,' said the domino-enclosed person, who seemed to be  in skintight black clothes under his dominoes, 'I am the Master of the  Robes. I only attend on really distinguished persons. Double-six, at  your service, Sir. Have you chosen your dress?'    'I'd like to wear the armour,' said Philip, holding it out. 'It seems  the right thing for a Knight,' he added.    'Quite so, sir. I confirm your opinion.'    He proceeded to dress Philip in a white tunic and to fasten the coat of  mail over this. 'I've had a great deal of experience,' he said; 'you  couldn't have chosen better. You see, I'm master of the subject of  dress. I am able to give my whole mind to it; my own dress being fixed  by law and not subject to changes of fashion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#14)"],[1,"house was accessible only from the water, till the last  possessor opened an entrance by stairs upon the land.    They had formerly reason to be afraid, not only of declared wars and  authorized invaders, or of roving pirates, which, in the northern seas,  must have been very common; but of inroads and insults from rival clans,  who, in the plenitude of feudal independence, asked no leave of their  Sovereign to make war on one another.  Sky has been ravaged by a feud  between the two mighty powers of Macdonald and Macleod.  Macdonald having  married a Macleod upon some discontent dismissed her, perhaps because she  had brought him no children.  Before the reign of James the Fifth, a  Highland Laird made a trial of his wife for a certain time, and if she  did not please him, he was then at liberty to send her away.  This  however must always have offended, and Macleod resenting the injury,  whatever were its circumstances, declared, that the wedding had been  solemnized without a bonfire, but that the separation should be better  illuminated; and raising a little army, set fire to the territories of  Macdonald, who returned the visit, and prevailed.    Another story may show the disorderly state of insular neighbourhood.  The  inhabitants of the Isle of Egg, meeting a boat manned by Macleods, tied  the crew hand and foot, and set them a-drift.  Macleod landed upon Egg,  and demanded the offenders; but the inhabitants refusing to surrender  them, retreated to a cavern, into which they thought their enemies  unlikely to follow them.  Macleod choked them with smoke, and left them  lying dead by families as they stood.    Here the violence of the weather confined us for some time, not at all to  our discontent or inconvenience.  We would indeed very willingly have  visited the Islands, which might be seen from the house scattered in the  sea, and I was particularly desirous to have viewed Isay; but the storms  did not permit us to launch a boat, and we were condemned to listen in  idleness to the wind, except when we were better engaged by listening to  the ladies.    We had here more wind than waves, and suffered the severity of a tempest,  without enjoying its magnificence.  The sea being broken by the multitude  of islands, does not roar with so much noise, nor beat the shore with  such foamy violence, as I have remarked on the coast of Sussex.  Though,  while I was in the Hebrides, the wind was extremely turbulent, I never  saw very high billows.    The country about Dunvegan is rough and barren.  There are no trees,  except in the orchard, which is a low sheltered spot surrounded with a  wall.    When this house was intended to sustain a siege, a well was made in the  court, by boring the rock downwards, till water was found, which though  so near to the sea, I have not heard mentioned as brackish, though it has  some hardness, or other qualities, which make it less fit for use; and  the family is now better supplied from a stream, which runs by the rock,  from two pleasing waterfalls.    Here we saw some traces of former manners, and heard some standing  traditions.  In the house is kept an ox's horn, hollowed so as to hold  perhaps two quarts, which the heir of Macleod was expected to swallow at  one draught, as a test of his manhood, before he was permitted to bear  arms, or could claim a seat among the men.  It is held that the return of  the Laird to Dunvegan, after any considerable absence, produces a  plentiful capture of herrings; and that, if any woman crosses the water  to the opposite Island, the herrings will desert the coast.  Boetius  tells the same of some other place.  This tradition is not uniform.  Some  hold that no woman may pass, and others that none may pass but a Macleod.    Among other guests, which the hospitality of Dunvegan brought to the  table, a visit was paid by the Laird and Lady of a small island south of  Sky, of which the proper name is Muack, which signifies swine.  It is  commonly called Muck, which the proprietor not liking, has endeavoured,  without effect, to change to Monk.  It is usual to call gentlemen in  Scotland by the name of their possessions, as Raasay, Bernera, Loch Buy,  a practice necessary in countries inhabited by clans, where all that live  in the same territory have one name, and must be therefore discriminated  by some addition.  This gentleman, whose name, I think, is Maclean,  should be regularly called Muck; but the appellation, which he thinks too  coarse for his Island, he would like still less for himself, and he is  therefore addressed by the title of, Isle of Muck.    This little Island, however it be named, is of considerable value.  It is  two English miles long, and three quarters of a mile broad, and  consequently contains only nine hundred and sixty English acres.  It is  chiefly arable.  Half of this little dominion the Laird retains in his  own hand, and on the other half, live one hundred and sixty persons, who  pay their rent by exported corn.  What rent they pay, we were not told,  and could not decently inquire.  The proportion of the people to the land  is such, as the most fertile countries do not commonly maintain.    The Laird having all his people under his immediate view, seems to be  very attentive to their happiness.  The devastation of the small-pox,  when it visits places where it comes seldom, is well known.  He has  disarmed it of its terrour at Muack, by inoculating eighty of his people.  The expence was two shillings and sixpence a head.  Many trades they  cannot have among them, but upon occasion, he fetches a smith from the  Isle of Egg, and has a tailor from the main land, six times a year.  This  island well deserved to be seen, but the Laird's absence left us no  opportunity.    Every inhabited island has its appendant and subordinate islets.  Muck,  however small, has yet others smaller about it, one of which has only  ground sufficient to afford pasture for three wethers.    At Dunvegan I had tasted lotus, and was in danger of forgetting that I  was ever to depart, till Mr. Boswell sagely reproached me with my  sluggishness and softness.  I had no very forcible defence to make; and  we agreed to pursue our journey.  Macleod accompanied us to Ulinish,  where we were entertained by the sheriff of the Island.          ULINISH      Mr. Macqueen travelled with us, and directed our attention to all that  was worthy of observation.  With him we went to see an ancient building,  called a dun or borough.  It was a circular inclosure, about forty-two  feet in diameter, walled round with loose stones, perhaps to the height  of nine feet.  The walls were very thick, diminishing a little toward the  top, and though in these countries, stone is not brought far, must have  been raised with much labour.  Within the great circle were several  smaller rounds of wall, which formed distinct apartments.  Its date, and  its use are unknown.  Some suppose it the original seat of the chiefs of  the Macleods.  Mr. Macqueen thought it a Danish fort.    The entrance is covered with flat stones, and is narrow, because it was  necessary that the stones which lie over it, should reach from one wall  to the other; yet, strait as the passage is, they seem heavier than could  have been placed where they now lie, by the naked strength of as many men  as might stand about them.  They were probably raised by putting long  pieces of wood under them, to which the action of a long line of lifters  might be applied.  Savages, in all countries, have patience proportionate  to their unskilfulness, and are content to attain their end by very  tedious methods.    If it was ever roofed, it might once have been a dwelling, but as there  is no provision for water, it could not have been a fortress.  In Sky, as  in every other place, there is an ambition of exalting whatever has  survived memory, to some important use, and referring it to very remote  ages.  I am inclined to suspect, that in lawless times, when the  inhabitants of every mountain stole the cattle of their neighbour, these  inclosures were used to secure the herds and flocks in the night.  When  they were driven within the wall, they might be easily watched, and  defended as long as could be needful; for the robbers durst not wait till  the injured clan should find them in the morning.    The interior inclosures, if the whole building were once a house, were  the chambers of the chief inhabitants.  If it was a place of security for  cattle, they were probably the shelters of the keepers.    From the Dun we were conducted to another place of security, a cave  carried a great way under ground, which had been discovered by digging  after a fox.  These caves, of which many have been found, and many  probably remain concealed, are formed, I believe, commonly by taking  advantage of a hollow, where banks or rocks rise on either side.  If no  such place can be found, the ground must be cut away.  The walls are made  by piling stones against the earth, on either side.  It is then roofed by  larger stones laid across the cavern, which therefore cannot be wide.  Over the roof, turfs were placed, and grass was suffered to grow; and the  mouth was concealed by bushes, or some other cover.    These caves were represented to us as the cabins of the first rude  inhabitants, of which, however, I am by no means persuaded.  This was so  low, that no man could stand upright in it.  By their construction they  are all so narrow, that two can never pass along them together, and being  subterraneous, they must be always damp.  They are not the work of an age  much ruder than the present; for they are formed with as much art as the  construction of a common hut requires.  I imagine them to have been  places only of occasional use, in which the Islander, upon a sudden  alarm, hid his utensils, or his cloaths, and perhaps sometimes his wife  and children.    This cave we entered, but could not proceed the whole length,"]]]
