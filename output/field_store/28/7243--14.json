Boiling water in a flask over a Patent lamp.]    EMILY.    I see some small bubbles ascend, and a great many appear all over the  inside of the flask; does the water begin to boil already?    MRS. B.    No; what you now see are bubbles of air, which were either dissolved in  the water, or attached to the inner surface of the flask, and which,  being rarefied by the heat, ascend in the water.    EMILY.    But the heat which rarefies the air inclosed in the water must rarefy  the water at the same time; therefore, if it could remain stationary in  the water when both were cold, I do not understand why it should not  when both are equally heated?    MRS. B.    Air being much less dense than water, is more easily rarefied; the  former, therefore, expands to a great extent, whilst the latter  continues to occupy nearly the same space; for water dilates  comparatively but very little without changing its state and becoming  vapour. Now that the water in the flask begins to boil, observe what  large bubbles rise from the bottom of it.    EMILY.    I see them perfectly; but I wonder that they have sufficient power to  force themselves through the water.    CAROLINE.    They _must_ rise, you know, from their specific levity.    MRS. B.    You are right, Caroline; but vapour has not in all liquids (when brought  to the degree of vaporization) the power of overcoming the pressure of  the less heated surface. Metals, for instance, mercury excepted,  evaporate only from the surface; therefore no vapour will ascend from  them till the degree of heat which is necessary to form it has reached  the surface; that is to say, till the whole of the liquid is brought to  a state of ebullition.    EMILY.    I have observed that steam, immediately issuing from the spout of a  teakettle, is less visible than at a further distance from it; yet it  must be more dense when it first evaporates, than when it begins to  diffuse itself in the air.    MRS. B.    When the steam is first formed, it is so perfectly dissolved by caloric,  as to be invisible. In order however to understand this, it will be  necessary for me to enter into some explanation respecting the nature of  SOLUTION. Solution takes place whenever a body is melted in a fluid. In  this operation the body is reduced to such a minute state of division by  the fluid, as to become invisible in it, and to partake of its fluidity;  but in common solutions this happens without any decomposition, the body  being only divided into its integrant particles by the fluid in which it  is melted.    CAROLINE.    It is then a mode of destroying the attraction of aggregation.    MRS. B.    Undoubtedly. --The two principal solvent fluids are _water_, and  _caloric_. You may have observed that if you melt salt in water, it  totally disappears, and the water remains clear, and transparent as  before; yet though the union of these two bodies appears so perfect, it  is not produced by any chemical combination; both the salt and the water  remain unchanged; and if you were to separate them by evaporating the  latter, you would find the salt in the same state as before.    EMILY.    I suppose that water is a solvent for solid bodies, and caloric for  liquids?    MRS. B.    Liquids of course can only be converted into vapour by caloric. But the  solvent power of this agent is not at all confined to that class of  bodies; a great variety of solid substances are dissolved by heat: thus  metals, which are insoluble in water, can be dissolved by intense heat,  being first fused or converted into a liquid, and then rarefied into an  invisible vapour. Many other bodies, such as salt, gums, &c. yield to  either of these solvents.    CAROLINE.    And that, no doubt, is the reason why hot water will melt them so much  better than cold water?    MRS. B.    It is so. Caloric may, indeed, be considered as having, in every  instance, some share in the solution of a body by water, since water,  however low its temperature may be, always contains more or less  caloric.    EMILY.    Then, perhaps, water owes its solvent power merely to the caloric  contained in it?    MRS. B.    That, probably, would be carrying the speculation too far; I should  rather think that water and caloric unite their efforts to dissolve a  body, and that the difficulty or facility of effecting this, depend both  on the degree of attraction of aggregation to be overcome, and on the  arrangement of the particles which are more or less disposed to be  divided and penetrated by the solvent.    EMILY.    But have not all liquids the same solvent power as water?    MRS. B.    The solvent power of other liquids varies according to their nature, and  that of the substances submitted to their action. Most of these  solvents, indeed, differ essentially from water, as they do not merely  separate the integrant particles of the bodies which they dissolve, but  attack their constituent principles by the power of chemical attraction,  thus producing a true decomposition. These more complicated operations  we must consider in another place, and confine our attention at present  to the solutions by water and caloric.    CAROLINE.    But there are a variety of substances which, when dissolved in water,  make it thick and muddy, and destroy its transparency.    MRS. B.    In this case it is not a solution, but simply a mixture. I shall show  you the difference between a solution and a mixture, by putting some  common salt into one glass of water, and some powder of chalk into  another; both these substances are white, but their effect on the water  will be very different.    CAROLINE.    Very different indeed! The salt entirely disappears and leaves the water  transparent, whilst the chalk changes it into an opaque liquid like  milk.    EMILY.    And would lumps of chalk and salt produce similar effects on water?    MRS. B.    Yes, but not so rapidly; salt is, indeed, soon melted though in a lump;  but chalk, which does not mix so readily with water, would require a  much greater length of time; I therefore preferred showing you the  experiment with both substances reduced to powder, which does not in any  respect alter their nature, but facilitates the operation merely by  presenting a greater quantity of surface to the water.    I must not forget to mention a very curious circumstance respecting  solutions, which is, that a fluid is not nearly so much increased in  bulk by holding a body in solution, as it would by mere mixture with the  body.    CAROLINE.    That seems impossible; for two bodies cannot exist together in the same  space.    MRS. B.    Two bodies may, by condensation, occupy less space when in union than  when separate, and this I can show you by an easy experiment.    This phial, which contains some salt, I shall fill with water, pouring  it in quickly, so as not to dissolve much of the salt; and when it is  quite full I cork it. --If I now shake the phial till the salt is  dissolved, you will observe that it is no longer full.    CAROLINE.    I shall try to add a little more salt. --But now, you see, Mrs. B., the  water runs over.    MRS. B.    Yes; but observe that the last quantity of salt you put in remains solid  at the bottom, and displaces the water; for it has already melted all  the salt it is capable of holding in solution. This is called the point  of _saturation_; and the water in this case is said to be _saturated_  with salt.    EMILY.    I think I now understand the solution of a solid body by water  perfectly: but I have not so clear an idea of the solution of a liquid  by caloric.    MRS. B.    It is probably of a similar nature; but as caloric is an invisible  fluid, its action as a solvent is not so obvious as that of water.  Caloric, we may conceive, dissolves water, and converts it into vapour  by the same process as water dissolves salt; that is to say, the  particles of water are so minutely divided by the caloric as to become  invisible. Thus, you are now enabled to understand why the vapour of  boiling water, when it first issues from the spout of a kettle, is  invisible; it is so, because it is then completely dissolved by caloric.  But the air with which it comes in contact, being much colder than the  vapour, the latter yields to it a quantity of its caloric. The particles  of vapour being thus in a great measure deprived of their solvent,  gradually collect, and become visible in the form of steam, which is  water in a state of imperfect solution; and if you were further to  deprive it of its caloric, it would return to its original liquid state.    CAROLINE.    That I understand very well. If you hold a cold plate over a tea-urn,  the steam issuing from it will be immediately converted into drops of  water by parting with its caloric to the plate; but in what state is the  steam, when it becomes invisible by being diffused in the air?    MRS. B.    It is not merely diffused, but is again dissolved by the air.    EMILY.    The air, then, has a solvent power, like water and caloric?    MRS. B.    This was formerly believed to be the case. But it appears from more  recent enquiries that the solvent power of the atmosphere depends solely  upon the caloric contained in it. Sometimes the watery vapour diffused  in the atmosphere is but imperfectly dissolved, as is the case in the  formation of clouds and fogs; but if it gets into a region sufficiently  warm, it becomes perfectly invisible.    EMILY.    Can any water dissolve in the atmosphere without its being previously  converted into vapour by boiling?    MRS. B.    Unquestionably; and this constitutes the difference between  _vaporization_ and _evaporation_. Water, when heated to the boiling  point, can no longer exist in the form of water, and must necessarily be  converted into vapour or steam, whatever may be the state and  temperature of the surrounding medium; this is called vaporization. But  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#14)"],[1,"grounds of  \"presumption,\" to be corroborated or reinforced by other evidence,  practically was of no avail. If received, at all, in any stage, or under  any name, it necessarily controlled every case. No amount of evidence,  of other kinds, could counterbalance or stand against it: nothing was  needed to give it full and fatal effect. It struck Court, Jury, and  people, nay, even the Prisoners themselves, in many instances, with awe.  It dispensed, as has been mentioned, with the presence of the accused,  on the spot, where and when the crime was alleged to have been  committed, or within miles or hundreds of miles of it. No reputation for  virtue or piety could be pleaded against it. The doctrine which Cotton  Mather proclaimed, on another occasion, that the Devil might appear as  Angel of Light, completed the demolition of the securities of innocence.  There was no difficulty in getting \"other testimony\" to give it effect.  In the then state of the public mind, indiscriminately crediting every  tale of slander and credulity, looking at every thing through the  refracting and magnifying atmosphere of the blindest and wildest  passions, it was easy to collect materials to add to the spectral  evidence, thereby, according to the doctrine of the Ministers, to raise  the \"presumption,\" to the \"conviction\" of guilt. Even our Reviewer finds  evidence to \"substantiate\" that, given against George Burroughs, resting  on spectres, in his feats of strength, in some malignant neighborhood  scandals, and in exaggerated forms of parish or personal animosities.          VII.    ADVICE OF THE MINISTERS, FURTHER CONSIDERED. COTTON MATHER'S PLAN FOR  DEALING WITH SPECTRAL TESTIMONY.      The _Advice of the Ministers_ is a document that holds a prominent place  in our public history; and its relation to events needs to be  elucidated.    In his _Life of Sir William Phips_, Cotton Mather has this paragraph:  \"And Sir William Phips arriving to his Government, after this ensnaring  horrible storm was begun, did consult the neighboring Ministers of the  Province, who made unto his Excellency and the Council, a Return (drawn  up, at their desire, by Mr. Mather, the younger, as I have been  informed) wherein they declared.\"--_Magnalia_, Book II., page 63.    He then gives, without intimating that any essential or substantial part  of the _declaration_, or _Advice_, was withheld, the Sections _not_  included in brackets.--_Vide_, pages 21, 22, _ante_.    It is to be observed that Phips is represented as having asked the  Ministers for their advice, and their answer as having been made to his  \"Excellency and the Council.\" There is no mention of this transaction in  the Records of the Council. Phips makes no reference to it in his letter  of the fourteenth of October, which is remarkable, as it would have been  to his purpose, in explaining the grounds of his procedure, in  organizing, and putting into operation, the judicial tribunal at Salem.  It may be concluded, from all that I shall present,--Sir William, having  given over the whole business to his Deputy and Chief-justice, with an  understanding that he was authorized to manage it, in all  particulars,--that this transaction with the Ministers may never have  been brought to the notice of the Governor at all: his official  character and title were, perhaps, referred to, as a matter of form. The  Council, as such, had nothing to do with it; but the Deputy-governor and  certain individual members of the Council, that is, those who, with him,  as Chief-justice, constituted the Special Court, asked and received the  _Advice_.    Again: the paragraph, as constructed by Mather, just quoted, certainly  leaves the impression on a reader, that Phips applied for the _Advice of  the Ministers_, at or soon after his arrival. The evidence, I think, is  conclusive, that the _Advice_ was not asked, until after the first  Session of the Court had been held. This is inferrible from the answer  of the Ministers, which is dated thirteen days after the first trial,  and five days after the execution of a sentence then passed. It alludes  to the _success_ which had been given to the prosecutions. If the  Government had asked counsel of the Ministers before the trials  commenced, it is inexplicable and incredible, besides being inexcusable,  that the Ministers should have delayed their reply until after the first  act of the awful tragedy had passed, and blood begun to be shed.  Hutchinson expressly says: \"The further trials were put off to the  adjournment, the thirtieth of June. The Governor and Council thought  proper, _in the mean time_, to take the opinion of several of the  principal Ministers, upon the state of things, as they then stood. This  was an old Charter practice.\"--_History_, ii., 52.    It has been regarded as a singular circumstance, that after such pains  had been taken, and so great a stretch of power practised, to put a  Court so suddenly in operation to try persons accused of witchcraft, on  the pretence, too, recorded in the Journal of the Council, of the  \"thronged\" condition of the jails, at that \"hot season,\" and after  trying one person only, it should have adjourned for four weeks.  Perhaps, by a collation of passages and dates, we may reach a probable  explanation. In his letter to \"the Ministers in and near Boston,\"  written in January, 1696, after considering briefly, and in forcible  language, the fearful errors from which the Delusion of 1692 had risen,  and solemnly reminding them of what they ought to have done to lead  their people out of such errors, Calef brings their failure to do it  home to them, in these pungent words: \"If, instead of this, you have  some by word and writing propagated, and others recommended, such  doctrines, and abetted the false notions which are so prevalent in this  apostate age, it is high time to consider it. If, when authority found  themselves almost nonplust in such prosecutions, and sent to you for  your advice what they ought to do, and you have then thanked them for  what they had already done (and thereby encouraged them to proceed in  those very by-paths already fallen into) it so much the more nearly  concerns you. _Ezek._, xxxiii., 2 to 8.\"--_Calef_, 92.    Looking at this passage, in connection with that quoted just before from  Hutchinson, we gather that something had occurred that \"nonplust\" the  Court--some serious embarrassment, that led to its sudden  adjournment--after the condemnation of Bridget Bishop, while many other  cases had been fully prepared for trial by the then Attorney-general.  Newton, and the parties to be tried had, the day before, been brought to  Salem from the jail in Boston, and were ready to be put to the Bar. What  was the difficulty? The following may be the solution.    Brattle informs us, and he was able to speak with confidence, that  \"Major N. Saltonstall, Esq., who was one of the Judges, has left the  Court, and is very much dissatisfied with the proceedings of  it.\"--_Massachusetts Historical Collections, I., v., 75._    The questions arise; When and why did he leave the Court? The Records of  the Council show that he was constant in his attendance at that Board,  his name always appearing at the head of the roll of those present,  until the sixteenth of June, from which date it does not appear again  until the middle of February, 1693. The Legislature, in the exercise of  its powers, under the Charter, had, near the close of 1692, established  a regular Superior Court, consisting of Stoughton, Danforth--who had  disapproved of the proceedings of the Special Court--Richards, Wait  Winthrop, and Sewall. It continued, in January, 1693, witchcraft trials;  but spectral evidence being wholly rejected, the prosecutions all broke  down; and Stoughton, in consequence, left the Court in disgust. After  all had been abandoned, and his own course, thereby, vindicated, Major  Saltonstall re-appeared at the Council Board; and was re-elected by the  next House of Representatives. His conduct, therefore, was very marked  and significant. In the only way in which he, a country member, could  express his convictions, as there were no such facilities, in the press  or otherwise, for public discussions, as we now have, he made them  emphatically known; and is worthy of the credit of being the only public  man of his day who had the sense or courage to condemn the proceedings,  at the start. He was a person of amiable and genial deportment; and,  from the County Court files, in which his action, as a Magistrate, is  exhibited in several cases, it is evident that he was methodical and  careful in official business, but susceptible of strong impressions and  convictions, and had, on a previous occasion manifested an utter want of  confidence in certain parties, who, it became apparent at the first  Session of the Court, were to figure largely in hearing spectral  testimony, in most of the cases. He had no faith in those persons, and  was thus, we may suppose, led to discredit, wholly, that species of  testimony.    From his attendance at the Council Board, up to the sixteenth of June,  the day when the _Advice of the Ministers_ was probably received, it may  be assumed that he attended also, to that time, the sittings of the  Court; and that when he withdrew from the former, he did also from the  latter. The date indicates that his action, in withdrawing, was  determined by the import of the _Advice_.    If a gentleman of his position and family, a grandson of an original  Patentee, Sir Richard Saltonstall, and sitting as a Judge at the first  trial, had the independence and manly spirit to express, without  reserve, his disapprobation of the proceedings, the expression of Calef  is explained; and the Court felt the obstacle that was in their way.  Hence the immediate adjournment, and the resort to some extraordinary  expedient, to remove it.    This may account for the appeal to the Ministers. Great"]]]
