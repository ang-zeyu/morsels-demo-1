A force that had cut  and ground this canyon could have been nothing but a river like that.  The trail led down, and Slone had no doubt that it crossed the river  and led up out of the canyon. He wanted to stay there and gaze  endlessly and listen. At length he began the descent. As he proceeded  it seemed that the roar of the river lessened. He could not understand  why this was so. It took half an hour to reach the last level, a  ghastly, black, and iron-ribbed canyon bed, with the river splitting  it. He had not had a glimpse of Wildfire on this side of the divide,  but he found his tracks, and they led down off the last level, through  a notch in the black bank of marble to a sand-bar and the river.    Wildfire had walked straight off the sand into the water. Slone studied  the river and shore. The water ran slow, heavily, in sluggish eddies.  From far up the canyon came the roar of a rapid, and from below the  roar of another, heavier and closer. The river appeared tremendous, in  ways Slone felt rather than realized, yet it was not swift. Studying  the black, rough wall of rock above him, he saw marks where the river  had been sixty feet higher than where he stood on the sand. It was low,  then. How lucky for him that he had gotten there before flood season!  He believed Wildfire had crossed easily, and he knew Nagger could make  it. Then he piled and tied his supplies and weapons high on the saddle,  to keep them dry, and looked for a place to take to the water.    Wildfire had sunk deep before reaching the edge. Manifestly he had  lunged the last few feet. Slone found a better place, and waded in,  urging Nagger. The big horse plunged, almost going under, and began to  swim. Slone kept up-stream beside him. He found, presently, that the  water was thick and made him tired, so it was necessary to grasp a  stirrup and be towed. The river appeared only a few hundred feet wide,  but probably it was wider than it looked. Nagger labored heavily near  the opposite shore; still, he landed safely upon a rocky bank. There  were patches of sand in which Wildfire's tracks showed so fresh that  the water had not yet dried out of them.    Slone rested his horse before attempting to climb out of that split in  the rock. However, Wildfire had found an easy ascent. On this side of  the canyon the bare rock did not predominate. A clear trail led up a  dusty, gravelly slope, upon which scant greasewood and cactus appeared.  Half an hour's climbing brought Slone to where he could see that he was  entering a vast valley, sloping up and narrowing to a notch in the dark  cliffs, above which towered the great red wall and about that the  slopes of cedar and the yellow rim-rock.    And scarcely a mile distant, bright in the westering sunlight, shone  the red stallion, moving slowly.    Slone pressed on steadily. Just before dark he came to an ideal spot to  camp. The valley had closed up, so that the lofty walls cast shadows  that met. A clump of cottonwoods surrounding a spring, abundance of  rich grass, willows and flowers lining the banks, formed an oasis in  the bare valley. Slone was tired out from the day of ceaseless toil  down and up, and he could scarcely keep his eyes open. But he tried to  stay awake. The dead silence of the valley, the dry fragrance, the  dreaming walls, the advent of night low down, when up on the ramparts  the last red rays of the sun lingered, the strange loneliness--these  were sweet and comforting to him.    And that night's sleep was as a moment. He opened his eyes to see the  crags and towers and peaks and domes, and the lofty walls of that vast,  broken chaos of canyons across the river. They were now emerging from  the misty gray of dawn, growing pink and lilac and purple under the  rising sun.    He arose and set about his few tasks, which, being soon finished,  allowed him an early start.    Wildfire had grazed along no more than a mile in the lead. Slone looked  eagerly up the narrowing canyon, but he was not rewarded by a sight of  the stallion. As he progressed up a gradually ascending trail he became  aware of the fact that the notch he had long looked up to was where the  great red walls closed in and almost met. And the trail zigzagged up  this narrow vent, so steep that only a few steps could be taken without  rest. Slone toiled up for an hour--an age--till he was wet, burning,  choked, with a great weight on his chest. Yet still he was only  half-way up that awful break between the walls. Sometimes he could have  tossed a stone down upon a part of the trail, only a few rods below,  yet many, many weary steps of actual toil. As he got farther up the  notch widened. What had been scarcely visible from the valley below was  now colossal in actual dimensions. The trail was like a twisted mile of  thread between two bulging mountain walls leaning their ledges and  fronts over this tilted pass.    Slone rested often. Nagger appreciated this and heaved gratefully at  every halt. In this monotonous toil Slone forgot the zest of his  pursuit. And when Nagger suddenly snorted in fright Slone was not  prepared for what he saw.    Above him ran a low, red wall, around which evidently the trail led. At  the curve, which was a promontory, scarcely a hundred feet in an  airline above him, he saw something red moving, bobbing, coming out  into view. It was a horse.    Wildfire--no farther away than the length of three lassoes!    There he stood looking down. He fulfilled all of Slone's dreams. Only  he was bigger. But he was so magnificently proportioned that he did not  seem heavy. His coat was shaggy and red. It was not glossy. The color  was what made him shine. His mane was like a crest, mounting, then  failing low. Slone had never seen so much muscle on a horse. Yet his  outline was graceful, beautiful. The head was indeed that of the  wildest of all wild creatures--a stallion born wild--and it was  beautiful, savage, splendid, everything but noble. Whatever Wildfire  was, he was a devil, a murderer--he had no noble attributes. Slone  thought that if a horse could express hate, surely Wildfire did then.  It was certain that he did express curiosity and fury.    Slone shook a gantleted fist at the stallion, as if the horse were  human. That was a natural action for a rider of his kind. Wildfire  turned away, showed bright against the dark background, and then  disappeared.        CHAPTER VI    That was the last Slone saw of Wildfire for three days.    It took all of this day to climb out of the canyon. The second was a  slow march of thirty miles into a scrub cedar and pinyon forest,  through which the great red and yellow walls of the canyon could be  seen. That night Slone found a water-hole in a rocky pocket and a  little grass for Nagger. The third day's travel consisted of forty  miles or more through level pine forest, dry and odorous, but lacking  the freshness and beauty of the forest on the north side of the canyon.  On this south side a strange feature was that all the water, when there  was any, ran away from the rim. Slone camped this night at a muddy pond  in the woods, where Wildfire's tracks showed plainly.    On the following day Slone rode out of the forest into a country of  scanty cedars, bleached and stunted, and out of this to the edge of a  plateau, from which the shimmering desert flung its vast and desolate  distances, forbidding and menacing. This was not the desert upland  country of Utah, but a naked and bony world of colored rock and sand--a  painted desert of heat and wind and flying sand and waterless wastes  and barren ranges. But it did not daunt Slone. For far down on the  bare, billowing ridges moved a red speck, at a snail's pace, a slowly  moving dot of color which was Wildfire.    On open ground like this, Nagger, carrying two hundred and fifty  pounds, showed his wonderful quality. He did not mind the heat nor the  sand nor the glare nor the distance nor his burden. He did not tire. He  was an engine of tremendous power.    Slone gained upon Wildfire, and toward evening of that day he reached  to within half a mile of the stallion. And he chose to keep that far  behind. That night he camped where there was dry grass, but no water.    Next day he followed Wildfire down and down, over the endless swell of  rolling red ridges, bare of all but bleached white grass and meager  greasewood, always descending in the face of that painted desert of  bold and ragged steps. Slone made fifty miles that day, and gained the  valley bed, where a slender stream ran thin and spread over a wide  sandy bottom. It was salty water, but it was welcome to both man and  beast.    The following day he crossed, and the tracks of Wildfire were still wet  on the sand-bars. The stallion was slowing down. Slone saw him, limping  along, not far in advance. There was a ten-mile stretch of level  ground, blown hard as rock, from which the sustenance had been  bleached, for not a spear of grass grew there. And following that was a  tortuous passage through a weird region of clay dunes, blue and violet  and heliotrope and lavender, all worn smooth by rain and wind. Wildfire  favored the soft ground now. He had deviated from his straight course.  And he was partial to washes and dips in the earth where water might  have lodged. And he was not now scornful of a green-scummed water-hole  with its white margin of alkali. That night Slone made camp with  Wildfire in plain sight. The stallion stopped when his pursuers  stopped. And he began to graze on the same stretch with Nagger. How  strange this seemed to Slone!    Here at this camp was evidence of Indians. Wildfire had swung round to  the north in his course. Like any pursued wild animal, he had began to  circle. And he had pointed his nose toward the Utah he had left.    Next morning Wildfire was not in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#14)"],[1,"of God, with their substance and their persons,  shall not be treated alike.\" (Sura iv. 97). Years after, Zeid said: \"I  fancy I see the words now on the shoulder-blade near a crack.\"    {64}    The question of the eternal nature of the Quran does not properly come  under the head of 'Ilm-i-usul, but it is a dogma fondly cherished by many  Muslims. In the days of the Khalif Al-Mamun this question was fiercely  debated. The Freethinkers, whilst believing in the Mission of Muhammad,  asserted that the Quran was created, by which statement they meant that the  revelation came to him in a subjective mode, and that the language was his  own. The book was thus brought within the reach of criticism. In the year  212, A.H. the Khalif issued a decree to the effect that all who held the  Quran to be uncreated were to be declared guilty of heresy. But the Khalif  himself was a notorious rationalist, and so the orthodox, though they  remained quiet, remained unconvinced. The arguments used on the orthodox  side are, that both the words and their pronunciation are eternal, that the  attempt to draw a distinction between the word as it exists in the Divine  Mind and as it appears in the Quran is highly dangerous. In vain do their  opponents argue that, if the Quran is uncreated, two Eternal Beings are in  existence. To this it is answered: \"This is the honourable Quran, written  in the preserved Tablet.\" (Sura lvi. 76). A Tradition is also adduced which  states: \"God wrote the Thora (Law) with His own hand, and with His own hand  He created Adam; and also in the Quran it is written, 'and We wrote for him  upon the tables a monition concerning every matter,' in reference to the  tables of the Law given to Moses.\" If God did this for former prophets and  their works, how much more, it is argued, should he not have done it for  the last and greatest of the prophets, and the noble Quran? It is not easy  to get a correct definition of the term \"the uncreated Quran,\" but it has  been put thus: \"The Word as it exists in the mind of God is 'Kalam-i-Nafsi'  (spiritual word), something unwritten and eternal. It is acknowledged by  the Ijma'-i-Ummat (consent of the Faithful), the Traditions, and by other  prophets that God {65} speaks. The Kalam-i-Nafsi then is eternal, but the  actual words, style, and eloquence are created by God; so also is the  arrangement and the miraculous nature of the book.\" This seems to be a  reasonable account of the doctrine, though there are theologians who hold  that the very words are eternal. The doctrine of abrogation clashes with  this idea, but they meet the objection by their theory of absolute  predestination. This accounts for the circumstances which necessitated the  abrogation, for the circumstances, as well as the abrogated verses, were  determined on from all eternity.    This concludes the consideration of the exegesis of the Quran, a book  difficult and uninteresting for a non-Muslim to read, but one which has  engaged and is still engaging the earnest thoughts of many millions of the  human race. Thousands of devout students in the great theological schools  of Cairo, Stamboul, Central Asia and India are now plodding through this  very subject of which I have here been treating; soon will they go forth as  teachers of the book they so much revere. How utterly unfit that training  is to make them wise men in any true sense of the word, how calculated to  render them proud, conceited, and scornful of other creeds, its rigid and  exclusive character shows. Still, it is a marvellous book; for twelve  hundred years and more it has helped to mould the faith, animate the  courage, cheer the despondency of multitudes, whether dwellers in the wild  uplands of Central Asia, in Hindustan, or on the shores of the  Mediterranean. The Turanian and the Aryan, the Arab and the Negro, alike  learn its sonorous sentences, day by day repeat its opening clauses, and  pray in its words as their fathers prayed before them.    Next to the act of testifying to the unity of God, the Quran is the great  bond of Islam. No matter from what race the convert may have come, no  matter what language he may speak, he must learn in Arabic, and repeat by  rote portions of the Quran in every act of public worship.    The next subject for consideration is that of the {66} Traditions, or the  second branch of the science of 'Ilm-i-usul. The Traditions contain the  record of all that Muhammad did and said. It is the belief of every Muslim,  to whatever sect he belongs, that the Prophet not only spake but also acted  under a divine influence. The mode of the inspiration is different from  that of the Quran. There the revelation was objective. In the Prophet's  sayings recorded in the Traditions the inspiration is subjective, but still  a true inspiration. This belief places the Traditions in a place second  only to the Quran; it makes them a true supplement to that book, and thus  they not only throw light on its meaning, but themselves form the basis on  which doctrines may be established. Without going so far as to say that  every Tradition by itself is to be accepted as an authority in Islam, it  may be distinctly asserted that there can be no true conception formed of  that system if the Traditions are not studied and taken into account. So  important a branch of Muslim theology is it, that the study of the  Traditions is included in the 'Ilm-i-usul, or science of exegesis. Some  account of them, therefore, naturally forms part of this chapter.    The first four Khalifs were called the Khulafa-i-Rashidin that is, those  who could guide others aright. They had been friends and Companions of the  Prophet, and the Faithful could always appeal to them in cases of doubt.  The Prophet had declared that Islam must be written in the hearts of men.  There was therefore an unwillingness to commit his sayings to writing. They  were handed down by word of mouth. As no argument was so effectual in a  dispute as \"a saying\" of the Prophet, the door was opened by which spurious  Traditions could be palmed off on the Faithful. To prevent this, a number  of strict rules were framed, at the head of which stands the Prophet's  saying, itself a Tradition: \"Convey to other persons none of my words  except those which ye know of a surety. Verily, he who purposely represents  my {67} words wrongly will find a place for himself nowhere but in fire.\"  To enforce this rule, it was laid down that the relator of a Tradition must  also repeat its \"Isnad,\" or chain of authorities, as: \"I heard from such an  one, who heard from such an one,\" and so on, until the chain reaches the  Prophet himself. Each person, too, in this \"Isnad,\" must have been well  known for his good character and retentive memory. This failed, however, to  prevent a vast number of manifestly false Traditions becoming current; so  men set themselves to the work of collecting and sifting the great mass of  Tradition that in the second century of Islam had begun to work untold  evil. These men are called \"Muhadisin,\" or \"collectors of Tradition.\" The  Sunnis and the Wahhabis recognise six such men, and their collections are  known as the \"Sihah-Sittah,\" or six correct books. They are the  following:--    (1). The _Sahih-i-Bukhari_, called after Abu Abdullah Muhammad  Ibn-i-Isma'il, a native of Bukhara. He was born A.H. 194. He was a man of  middle height, spare in frame, and as a boy totally blind. The grief of his  father was on this account intense; but one day in a dream he saw the  Patriarch Abraham, who said to him: \"God on account of thy grief and sorrow  has granted sight to thy son.\" The sight being thus restored, at the age of  ten he went to school, and began to learn the Traditions by heart. After  his education was finished, a famous Muhadis named Dakhli came to Bukhara.  One day the youthful Bukhari ventured to correct the famous man. It was an  astounding piece of audacity, but the youth was proved to be in the right.  This set him on the work of collecting and sifting the Traditions. At the  early age of sixteen he was able to remember fifteen thousand. In course of  time he collected 600,000 Traditions. The result of his examination and  selection was that he approved of seven thousand two hundred and  seventy-five. These are now recorded in his great work, the  Sahih-i-Bukhari. It {68} is said that he never sat down to examine a  Tradition without first performing a legal ablution, and repeating two  rak'at prayers. He then said: \"O Lord, let me not make a mistake.\" For  sixteen years he lived in a mosque and died much respected at the age of  sixty-four.    (2). _Sahih-i-Muslim._ Muslim Ibn-i-Hajjaj was born at Nishapur, a city of  Khorasan. He collected about 300,000 Traditions, from which he made his  collection. He is said to have been a very just man, and willing to oblige  all who sought his advice. In fact, this willingness to oblige was the  indirect cause of his death. One day he was sitting as usual in the mosque  when some people came to ask him about a Tradition. As he could not  discover it in the books he had with him, he went to his house to search  there. The people brought him a basket of dates. He went on eating and  searching, but unfortunately he ate so many dates that he died. (A.H. 261.)    (3). _Sunan-i-Abu Daud._ Abu Daud Sajistani, a native of Seistan, was born  A.H. 202. He was a great traveller, and went to all the chief places of  Musalman learning. In knowledge of the Traditions, in devotion, in piety,  he was unrivalled. He collected about 500,000 Traditions, of which he  selected four thousand eight hundred for his book.    (4). _Jami'-i-Tirmizi._ Abu Isa' Muhammad Tirmizi was born at Tirmiz in the  year A.H. 209. He was a disciple of Bukhari. Ibn Khallikan says this work  is \"the production of a well-informed man: its exactness is  proverbial.\"[61]    (5). _Sunan-i-Nasai._ Abu Abd-ur-Rahman Nasai was born at Nasa, in  Khorasan, in the"]]]
