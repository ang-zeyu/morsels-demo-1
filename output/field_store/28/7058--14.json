I haven't been studying girls all these years  without learning something of character.  Some fillies you can drive  with a snaffle, others need the curb.  You drive yourself, and  understand what I mean.  I can see quite well that you are a proud,  sensitive girl, with a good heart hidden away behind a lot of nonsense.  If it were not for that heart I shouldn't trouble myself about you, but  simply give my orders, and see that they were obeyed.  But there's  nothing mean about me, and I'd scorn to take an unfair advantage.  Now,  I'll tell you straight that I have come to the conclusion that I judged  you wrongly about that pony business, and that you didn't mean to brag.  I saw by the way you flared out that you were really hurt, and I was  sorry.  I've no pity on brag, but when I judge a girl wrongly I feel  sick.  If it's any relief to your mind to know it, I believe that little  episode upset me more than it did you.  When you said I was not worthy  of my position, and made new-comers wretched, you hit me very hard,  Rhoda, very hard indeed!\"    She stopped short and jingled furiously at her chains, then suddenly  looked up, gave a roguish smile, and cried, insinuatingly--    \"There, I've done my part.  I've acknowledged I was wrong.  You are no  coward, so you will do as much!  You will admit that you have been a  difficult subject, won't you now?\"    Rhoda looked at her and hesitated.  She cleared her throat and  determined to speak openly, and then suddenly, suddenly, something  swelled at her throat, and she heard her own voice say chokingly:    \"I suppose I've been stupid...  I've never been accustomed to be--  ordered about!  I'm sorry if I was disagreeable, but I never, never  meant to--give myself airs!\"    \"But you did though, all the same,\" cried Thomasina briskly.  \"Bless me,  yes!  The way you came into a room, the way you walked out, the way you  looked at your food, and turned it over on your plate, the way you eyed  the other girls up and down, down and up--it all said as plainly as  print `I'm Her Royal Highness of Chester, and I won't have any dealings  with the likes of _You_!'  If you had been a Princess of the blood you  couldn't have put on more side, and so, of course, we judged your words  by your actions, and thought you were bragging when you meant nothing of  the sort.  Now, just make up your mind, like a sensible girl, to forget  your own importance, and don't always be on the lookout for insults to  your dignity.  Your dignity will look after itself if it's any good, and  you'll be a heap happier if you give up coddling and fussing over it all  day long.  There was that little matter of the pigtail the other  morning!  It wasn't my wish that you should tie back your hair.  I don't  mind telling you that it's much less becoming than it was, but I was  simply acting as the mouthpiece of Miss Bruce, as you might have known  if you had taken one minute to consider.  Your friend, Dorothy What-  ever-she-calls-herself, behaved like a sensible girl, and did as she was  told without making a fuss, but you must needs work yourself into a  fury.  You'll have a fit one of these days if you are not careful.  You  are just one of those fair, reddy people who are subject to apoplexy, so  don't say I didn't warn you.  When we went down to breakfast I tried to  be friendly, just to show there was no ill-feeling, and you went and  starved yourself rather than accept a crumb from my hands.  It reminded  me awfully of my little cousin of three.  When he is made to do what he  doesn't like, he refuses to eat his bread and milk.  He seems to think  he is punishing us somehow; but, bless your heart, _we_ don't mind!  We  know he is strong and hearty, and that it will do him no harm to starve  once in a way.  I wasn't in the least anxious about you, but I don't  want you to go on feeling wretched in my house, so I'll do my best to  consider your feelings.  I warn you, however, I can't stop chaffing.  If  I think of a funny thing to say, I _must_ say it or burst, and if you  don't like it you can comfort yourself by thinking that it's for your  good, and will teach you to control your temper.  If you get offended  after this, the more fool you, for I tell you straight there will be no  ill-feeling in my mind, nothing but simple, pure buffoonery.\"    Rhoda smiled feebly.  The cool, unemotional tones of the other had  effectually dried her tears, but the softened expression remained, and  her voice had almost an humble intonation.    \"I'll try.  I know I am touchy, but I shan't mind so much now that you--  that you have explained!  I think you have been very generous.\"    \"All right,\" interrupted Thomasina briskly.  \"Don't gush.  I loathe  gush.  That's all right, then, and I'll tell the girls I was wrong just  now.  They will all treat you decently if I tell them to; so behave  sensibly, and don't be a young jackass, and all will be well.\"    \"I--er, I _beg_ your pardon!\"    \"Don't mention it!\"  Thomasina beamed amiably over her shoulder.  \"Jackass, I said--don't be a jackass!  The gong will ring in ten  minutes, so you'd better be off to your room.  Pleased to have seen you!  Good afternoon.  Come again another day!\"        CHAPTER TEN.    HARD WORK.    From that day forward matters moved more smoothly for Rhoda.  Dorothy  reported that Tom had returned to the house-parlour to explain her  regret at having misjudged a new-comer, and her desire that her  colleagues would second her effort to make Rhoda happy, and, as usual,  Tom's word was law.  That very evening several of the girls took an  opportunity of exchanging friendly remarks with Rhoda, while at supper  an amount of attention was bestowed upon her plate which was positively  embarrassing.  It was a delightful change, but through all the relief  rang the sting of remembering that it had been accomplished by  Thomasina, not herself; that the new friendliness was the result of  Thomasina's orders rather than her own deserts.  To her fellow-students  she was still an insignificant new-comer, with no claim to distinction.  If she excelled in one subject, she was behind in the next, while at  games she was hopelessly ignorant.  It was wormwood and gall to be  obliged to join the \"Bantlings\" at hockey, and be coached by a girl of  twelve; but Rhoda set her teeth and determined that if pluck and energy  could help, it would be a short time indeed before she got her reward.  Oh, those first few games, what unmitigated misery they were!  The ankle  pads got in her way, and made her waddle like a duck, and when at last  she began to congratulate herself on overcoming the first difficulty,  they tripped her up, and landed her unexpectedly on the ground.  Although she was repeatedly warned to keep her stick down, it seemed to  fly up of itself, and bring disgrace upon her; and then, alas! the ball  followed its example, bounded up from the ground, and landed neatly on  her cheek immediately beneath her left eye.  A hideous swelling and  discolouration was the result, but after the first rush to see that the  damage was not serious, no one seemed in the least agitated about the  mishap.  Erley Chase would have been convulsed with panic from attic to  cellar, but Thomasina only struck an attitude, and exclaimed, \"Oh! my  eye!\" and even Miss Everett smiled, more in amusement than horror, as  she cried, \"In the wars already, Rhoda?  You _have_ begun early.\"  Mrs  Chester would hardly have recognised her darling in the knickerbockered  girl, with her curly mane screwed into a pigtail, her dainty feet  scuffling the ground, and her face disfigured by a lump, which changed  to a different colour with each new dawn.  If she could have had a  glimpse of her during that tragic period it is certain that Rhoda's term  at \"Hurst\" would have been short indeed: but she was not informed of the  accident, while each letter showed an increasing interest in work and  play.  Rhoda had put her back into her studies, and worked with an  almost feverish earnestness.  The hours of preparation were all too  short, but she found a dozen ways of adding to their length, so that  from morning to night her brain was never allowed to rest.  She grew  white and tired, and so perceptibly thin that Miss Bruce questioned her  class-mistress as to the change in her appearance.    \"She is an ambitious girl,\" was the reply, \"and does not like to feel  behind.  She is working hard, and making progress; but she never  complains, or appears to feel ill.\"    \"Oh, well, everything in moderation.  See that she is not overworked.  There will be no time gained in that way,\" said the principal, and  forthwith banished the subject from her busy brain.  There came a day,  however, half way through the term, when Rhoda collapsed, and found it  impossible to rise from her bed.  Three times over she made the effort,  and three times sank back upon her pillow faint and trembling, and then  in despair she raised her voice, and wailed a feeble \"Tom!\"    Tom came promptly, buttoning her magenta jacket, and went through a most  professional examination.    \"To the best of my judgment,\" she announced finally, \"you are sickening  for scarlatina, tonsilitis, and housemaid's knee, but if you stay in bed  and have an invalid's breakfast I should say you would be fairly  convalescent by twelve o'clock.  Snoddle down, and I'll see Nurse as  soon as I'm dressed, and put her on the track.\"    \"I want Miss Everett!\" sighed Rhoda plaintively, and Tom gave a grunt of  assent.    \"I expect you do.  All the girls want her when they are ill.  She's no  time to spare, but I'll tell her, and probably she'll squeeze in five  minutes for you after breakfast.  You are not going to die this time, my  dear, so don't lose heart.  We shall see your fairy form among us before  many hours are past!\"    Perhaps so.

[Illustration]          [Illustration: ROMAN SNAILS.]    ROMAN SNAILS.      \"How _can_ you take an interest in snails and slugs?--horrid, slimy,  crawling things!\" More than once have I heard this kind of remark from  youthful lips when I produced my grand old Roman snails and gave them a  pleasant time for exercise upon the dewy lawn. Now in my secret mind I  think a snail is a wonderfully curious creature, neither ugly nor  \"horrid\"--it _is_ slimy, but about that I shall have something to say  later on.    When staying at Box Hill, near Dorking, I often saw the great apple  snail, _Helix Pomatia_, which is only found on chalk soils, and is  supposed to have been introduced by the Romans, from the quantities of  their empty shells found with Roman remains in all parts of England.  They were kept and fattened in places called \"Cochlearia\" and made into  various \"dainty dishes\" which the Romans thought quite fit to set before  their kings. It is certain that they are very nutritious creatures, and  that in times of famine people have supported life and kept themselves  mysteriously \"fat and well-liking\" by resorting to snails and slugs as  articles of diet. Indeed I have heard more than once that the famous  \"Pate de Guimauve\" owes its healing nutritive character to this despised  univalve, which is said to enter largely into its composition. I brought  several apple snails home with me from Box Hill and kept them for many  years, until I really believe the creatures, in a dim sort of way,  recognized me as their friend, or at any rate their feeder. I cannot  boast, as I believe an American lady is said to have done, that \"her  tame oysters followed her up and down stairs,\" but certainly my snails  would, when placed upon the lawn, very frequently crawl towards me, and  would do so again and again when removed to a distance. As the weather  became cold they always hibernated, closing the mouth of the shell with  a thin, firm covering, or operculum, of chalk, which, mixed with their  slime, made a substance like plaster of Paris. Thus enclosed they would  lie as if dead until the warmth of the following spring made them push  the door open and come out, with excellent appetites, ready to eat  voraciously to make up for their long fast. These Roman snails were  quite five inches long when fully extended, and therefore were much  larger than our English species; the body was cream colour and the shell  a pale tint of buff varying somewhat in different specimens.    These creatures were kept in a fern case with glass top and sides, and  it was singular to observe the way in which they could suspend  themselves (as shown in the drawing) from the top of the box.    The substance which exists in the caterpillar of the silkworm moth, and  which can be drawn out into fine shreds of silk, is very similar to the  slime of the snail, only in the latter it is not filiform, but exudes as  a liquid and then hardens into a thin layer of silk which is strong  enough to support the weight of two of these snails, for, seeing them  one day thus suspended, I put them in the scales and ascertained that  the weight of the two amounted to 2-1/2 ounces.    This mucus forms the glistening, shiny track which the snail leaves  behind it, enabling it to glide easily and painlessly over rough  substances which would otherwise lacerate its soft body.    One hardly expected to find social feeling and affection in animals so  low down in the scale of nature, but I do not know what else could have  led my \"Romans\" to caress each other with their long horns by the hour  together and always keep close to one another, twisting and curling  their yielding bodies round each other in the most odd contortions. Our  English snails hibernate in whole colonies for the winter, which also  points to their affectionate and gregarious habits.    In lifting up some moss I once came upon some yellow, half-transparent  eggs about as large as pearl barley, and wishing to know what they would  prove to be I kept them in damp moss under a tumbler for about a  fortnight, when, to my dismay, I found a grand colony of yellow slugs!  and not a little was I teased about these interesting young people. I am  afraid I must own they were given as a _bonne bouche_ to my Virginian  nightingale, who seemed highly to approve of this addition to his daily  fare. Snails' eggs are nearly white and semi-transparent; the empty  shells of young snails are very lovely when placed in a good microscope:  the polariscope bringing out their exquisite prismatic tints.    The gardener one day brought in a testacella, or shelled slug. It fed  upon earth-worms and was quite unlike the ordinary black or grey slug,  of which we have, alas! countless thousands preying upon all the green  things of the earth. This shelled slug was yellow, and seemed able to  elongate its body very differently to any other species. The shell was  quite small, a simple dome-shaped plate upon the anterior part of the  body. I kept it for some weeks on damp moss under a tumbler, but it was  often able to escape by flattening itself to a mere thread and then  crawling under the rim of the tumbler, and at last I gave it liberty as  a reward for its persevering efforts to obtain its freedom.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    AN EARWIG MOTHER.      I had often read of the earwig as an incubating insect, and much wished  to see for myself how she carried out her motherly instincts. One bright  May morning found me busily turning over stones, clinkers, and old  tree-roots in a fernery, which, having been long undisturbed, seemed a  likely spot for the nest I wished to find. There seemed no scarcity of  worms, wood-lice, centipedes, or beetles, but no earwigs could I see;  and I was just about to give up the search when, lifting a piece of  stone, I saw a small cavity, about as large as would contain a pea, and  in it lay about twenty-six round, white eggs, hard-shelled and shining,  of the size of a small pin's head. An earwig had placed herself over the  eggs, and I was delighted to think at last I had lighted upon the insect  mother I had been searching for. But what was to be done with her? How  could I watch the process of incubation? The difficulty was solved by  lifting the nest and its mother with a trowel and placing it in a saucer  under a tumbler, without any displacement of the eggs; thus the mother's  care could be conveniently watched. The earwig first carefully examined  her new home, touching each morsel of earth and stone with her antennae;  and, having ascertained the exact condition of things, she set to work  to make a fresh nest, labouring with great industry until it was formed  to her mind. She then took up the eggs, one by one, with her mandibles,  and placed them in the new nest, arranging and rearranging them, until  at last she seemed content, and remained either upon or near them for  the rest of the day, quite motionless.    Every night, and sometimes two or three times in the day, she would  form fresh places in the earth, and replace the eggs. To prevent the  soil becoming too dry, I used to sprinkle a little water upon it--a drop  here and there--and if by accident the water fell too near the eggs, the  earwig became much excited, hurrying to and fro with her eggs, until  they were all removed to a drier spot. On the other hand, if I omitted  the water until the earth became dry, she would choose the dampest spot  that remained in which to form her nest, and seemed to welcome the  water-drops, drinking herself from them, and feeling the damp earth with  her antennae. She remained thus for three weeks, feeding on little pieces  of beef or mutton, or an occasional fly; I did not then know that  earwigs are mostly vegetable feeders, but it is clear they can eat other  food when needful. The first time I dropped a newly-killed house-fly  near her she looked at it intently, felt it with her antennae, and then  suddenly wheeled round and pinched it with her forceps, and being  apparently satisfied that it could do no harm to her eggs, she began to  devour it, and after an hour or two but little remained except the  wings.    As it was early in the year, but few insects could be seen, but by  searching in the conservatory I found a large green aphis, which I gave  to the earwig. To my surprise, instead of devouring it at once, she  applied herself to one of the projecting tubes of the aphis, and  evidently sucked its sweet secretion, and enjoyed it as much and in the  same way as ants are said to do. She feasted thus for four or five  minutes, but I am sorry to add that, unlike the humane ants, who care  tenderly for their aphides and preserve their lives by kind treatment,  the earwig ended by munching up the unfortunate aphis, till not a trace  of it was left.    At the end of three weeks I found one morning all the eggs were hatched,  and tiny, snow-white earwigs, with forceps and antennae fully developed,  were creeping about and around their mother. I placed a slice of pear in  the saucer, upon which the little ones swarmed, and seemed to find it  congenial food. In a few days they increased to nearly double their size  when first hatched, and turned a light brown colour. Having ascertained  all I wished to know about the maternal instincts of the earwig, I  released the mother and her family, and no doubt she was happy enough to  return to her old haunt in the fernery, and would greatly prefer  tree-roots and stones to my tumbler-and-saucer arrangement.

On reading books on Egypt and the voyage up the Nile, one is sure to  find some mention of the curious beetle which is found along the banks  of the river, especially in Nubia, where the shore is traceried with the  footprints of the busy little creature.
