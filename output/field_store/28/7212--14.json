These secondary asters, or _satellites_, follow the planets in their  course, and revolve round them in an ellipse, just as the others rotate  round the Sun. Every one knows the satellite of the Earth, the Moon. All  the other planets of our system have their own moons, some being even  more favored than ourselves in this respect, and having several. Mars  has two; Jupiter, five; Saturn, eight; Uranus, four; and Neptune, one  (at least as yet discovered).    In order to realize the relations between these worlds, we must  appreciate their distances by arranging them in a little table:                             Distance in    Distance in                           Millions of    Millions of                           Kilometers.       Miles.            Mercury             57              35            Venus              108              67            The Earth          149              93            Mars               226             140            Jupiter            775             481            Saturn           1,421             882            Uranus           2,831           1,755            Neptune          4,470           2,771    The Sun is at the center (or, more properly speaking, at the focus, for  the planets describe an ellipse) of this system, and controls them.  Neptune is thirty times farther from the Sun than the Earth. These  disparities of distance produce a vast difference in the periods of the  planetary revolutions; for while the Earth revolves round the Sun in a  year, Venus in 224 days, and Mercury in 88, Mars takes nearly 2 years to  accomplish his journey, Jupiter 12 years, Saturn 29, Uranus 84, and  Neptune 165.    Even the planets and their moons do not represent the Sun's complete  paternity. There are further, in the solar republic, certain vagabond  and irregular orbs that travel at a speed that is often most immoderate,  occasionally approaching the Sun, not to be consumed therein, but, as it  appears, to draw from its radiant source the provision of forces  necessary for their perigrinations through space. These are the  _Comets_, which pursue an extremely elongated orbit round the Sun, to  which at times they approximate very closely, at other times being  excessively distant.    And now to recapitulate our knowledge of the Solar Empire. In the first  place, we see a colossal globe of fire dominating and governing the  worlds that belong to him. Around him are grouped planets, in number  eight principal, formed of solid and obscure matter, gravitating round  the central orb. Other secondary orbs, the satellites, revolve round the  planets, which keep them within the sphere of their attraction. And  lastly, the comets, irregular celestial bodies, track the whole extent  of the great solar province. To these might be added the whirlwinds of  meteors, as it were disaggregated comets, which also circle round the  Sun, and give origin to shooting stars, when they come into collision  with the Earth.    Having now a general idea of our celestial family, and an appreciation  of the potent focus that controls it, let us make direct acquaintance  with the several members of which it is composed.          CHAPTER V    THE PLANETS    _A._--MERCURY, VENUS, THE EARTH, MARS      And now we are in the Solar System, at the center, or, better, at the  focus of which burns the immense and dazzling orb. We have appreciated  the grandeur and potency of the solar globe, whose rays spread out in  active waves that bear a fecundating illumination to the worlds that  gravitate round him; we have appreciated the distance that separates the  Sun from the Earth, the third of the planets retained within his domain,  or at least I trust that the comparisons of the times required by  certain moving objects to traverse this distance have enabled us to  conceive it.    We said that the four planets nearest to the Sun are Mercury, at a  distance of 57 million kilometers (35,000,000 miles); Venus, at 108  million (67,000,000 miles); the Earth, at 149 million (93,000,000  miles); and Mars at 226 million (140,000,000 miles). Let us begin our  planetary journey with these four stations.      MERCURY    A little above the Sun one sometimes sees, now in the West, in the  lingering shimmer of the twilight, now in the East, when the tender  roseate dawn announces the advent of a clear day, a small star of the  first magnitude which remains but a very short time above the horizon,  and then plunges back into the flaming sun. This is Mercury, the agile  and active messenger of Olympus, the god of eloquence, of medicine, of  commerce, and of thieves. One only sees him furtively, from time to  time, at the periods of his greatest elongations, either after the  setting or before the rising of the radiant orb, when he presents the  aspect of a somewhat reddish star.    This planet, like the others, shines only by the reflection of the Sun  whose illumination he receives, and as he is in close juxtaposition with  it, his light is bright enough, though his volume is inconsiderable. He  is smaller than the Earth. His revolution round the Sun being  accomplished in about three months, he passes rapidly, in a month and a  half, from one side to the other of the orb of day, and is alternately a  morning and an evening star. The ancients originally regarded it as two  separate planets; but with attentive observation, they soon perceived  its identity. In our somewhat foggy climates, it can only be discovered  once or twice a year, and then only by looking for it according to the  indications given in the astronomic almanacs.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Orbits of the four Planets nearest to the Sun.]    Mercury courses round the Sun at a distance of 57,000,000 kilometers  (35,000,000 miles), and accomplishes his revolution in 87 days, 23  hours, 15 minutes; _i.e._, 2 months, 27 days, 23 hours, or a little less  than three of our months. If the conditions of life are the same there  as here, the existence of the Mercurians must be four times as short as  our own. A youth of twenty, awaking to the promise of the life he is  just beginning in this world, is an octogenarian in Mercury. There the  fair sex would indeed be justified in bewailing the transitory nature of  life, and might regret the years that pass too quickly away. Perhaps,  however, they are more philosophic than with us.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Orbits of the four Planets farthest from the  Sun.]    The orbit of Mercury, which of course is within that of the Earth, is  not circular, but elliptical, and very eccentric, so elongated that at  certain times of the year this planet is extremely remote from the solar  focus, and receives only half as much heat and light as at the opposite  period; and, in consequence, his distance from the Earth varies  considerably.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Mercury near quadrature.]    This globe exhibits _phases_, discovered in the seventeenth century by  Galileo, which recall those of the Moon. They are due to the motions of  the planet round the Sun, and are invisible to the unaided eye, but with  even a small instrument, one can follow the gradations and study Mercury  under every aspect. Sometimes, again, he passes exactly in front of the  Sun, and his disk is projected like a black point upon the luminous  surface of the flaming orb. This occurred, notably, on May 10, 1891, and  November 10, 1894; and the phenomenon will recur on November 12, 1907,  and November 6, 1914.    Mercury is the least of all the worlds in our system (with the exception  of the cosmic fragments that circulate between the orbit of Mars and  that of Jupiter). His volume equals only 5/100 that of the Earth. His  diameter, in comparison with that of our planet, is in the ratio of 373  to 1,000 (a little more than 1/3) and measures 4,750 kilometers (2,946  miles). His density is the highest of all the worlds in the great solar  family, and exceeds that of our Earth by about 1/3; but weight there is  less by almost 1/2.    Mercury is enveloped in a very dense, thick atmosphere, which doubtless  sensibly tempers the solar heat, for the Sun exhibits to the Mercurians  a luminous disk about seven times more extensive than that with which we  are familiar on the Earth, and when Mercury is at perihelion (that is,  nearest to the Sun), his inhabitants receive ten times more light and  heat than we obtain at midsummer. In all probability, it would be  impossible for us to set foot on this planet without being shattered by  a sunstroke.    Yet we may well imagine that Nature's fecundity can have engendered  beings there of an organization different from our own, adapted to an  existence in the proximity of fire. What magnificent landscapes may  there be adorned with the luxuriant vegetation that develops rapidly  under an ardent and generous sun?    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--The Earth viewed from Mercury.]    Observations of Mercury are taken under great difficulties, just because  of the immediate proximity of the solar furnace; yet some have detected  patches that might be seas. In any case, these observations are  contradictory and uncertain.    Up to the present it has been impossible to determine the duration of  the rotation. Some astronomers even think that the Sun's close proximity  must have produced strong tides, that would, as it were, have  immobilized the globe of Mercury, just as the Earth has immobilized the  Moon, forcing it perpetually to present the same side to the Sun. From  the point of view of habitation, this situation would be somewhat  peculiar; perpetual day upon the illumined half, perpetual night upon  the other hemisphere, and a fairly large zone of twilight between the  two. Such a condition would indeed be different from the succession of  terrestrial days and nights.    As seen from Mercury, the Earth we inhabit would shine out in the starry  sky[9] as a magnificent orb"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#14)"],[1,"to throw myself at her  feet. \"Explain yourself!\" I cried. Tears flowed down her cheeks. I  became quite frantic. She wiped them away, without attempting to conceal  them. \"You know my aunt,\" she continued; \"she was present: and in  what light does she consider the affair! Last night, and this morning,  Werther, I was compelled to listen to a lecture upon my acquaintance  with you. I have been obliged to hear you condemned and depreciated; and  I could not--I dared not--say much in your defence.\"    Every word she uttered was a dagger to my heart. She did not feel what a  mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me. She told me, in  addition, all the impertinence that would be further circulated, and how  the malicious would triumph; how they would rejoice over the punishment  of my pride, over my humiliation for that want of esteem for others with  which I had often been reproached. To hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by  her in a voice of the most sincere sympathy, awakened all my passions;  and I am still in a state of extreme excitement. I wish I could find a  man to jeer me about this event. I would sacrifice him to my resentment.  The sight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury. A hundred  times have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart.  Naturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open a  vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course, in  order to breathe more freely. I am often tempted to open a vein, to  procure for myself everlasting liberty.    MARCH 24.    I have tendered my resignation to the court. I hope it will be accepted,  and you will forgive me for not having previously consulted you. It  is necessary I should leave this place. I know all you will urge me to  stay, and therefore I beg you will soften this news to my mother. I am  unable to do anything for myself: how, then, should I be competent to  assist others? It will afflict her that I should have interrupted that  career which would have made me first a privy councillor, and then  minister, and that I should look behind me, in place of advancing. Argue  as you will, combine all the reasons which should have induced me  to remain, I am going: that is sufficient. But, that you may not be  ignorant of my destination, I may mention that the Prince of--is here.  He is much pleased with my company; and, having heard of my intention  to resign, he has invited me to his country house, to pass the spring  months with him. I shall be left completely my own master; and, as we  agree on all subjects but one, I shall try my fortune, and accompany  him.    APRIL 19.    Thanks for both your letters. I delayed my reply, and withheld this  letter, till I should obtain an answer from the court. I feared my  mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose. But my request  is granted, my resignation is accepted. I shall not recount with what  reluctance it was accorded, nor relate what the minister has written:  you would only renew your lamentations. The crown prince has sent me  a present of five and twenty ducats; and, indeed, such goodness has  affected me to tears. For this reason I shall not require from my mother  the money for which I lately applied.    MAY 5.    I leave this place to-morrow; and, as my native place is only six miles  from the high road, I intend to visit it once more, and recall the happy  dreams of my childhood. I shall enter at the same gate through which  I came with my mother, when, after my father's death, she left that  delightful retreat to immure herself in your melancholy town. Adieu, my  dear friend: you shall hear of my future career.    MAY 9.    I have paid my visit to my native place with all the devotion of a  pilgrim, and have experienced many unexpected emotions. Near the great  elm tree, which is a quarter of a league from the village, I got out of  the carriage, and sent it on before, that alone, and on foot, I might  enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure of my recollections. I stood  there under that same elm which was formerly the term and object of my  walks. How things have since changed! Then, in happy ignorance, I sighed  for a world I did not know, where I hoped to find every pleasure and  enjoyment which my heart could desire; and now, on my return from that  wide world, O my friend, how many disappointed hopes and unsuccessful  plans have I brought back!    As I contemplated the mountains which lay stretched out before me, I  thought how often they had been the object of my dearest desires. Here  used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them, ardently  longing to wander in the shade of those woods, to lose myself in those  valleys, which form so delightful an object in the distance. With what  reluctance did I leave this charming spot; when my hour of recreation  was over, and my leave of absence expired! I drew near to the village:  all the well-known old summerhouses and gardens were recognised again; I  disliked the new ones, and all other alterations which had taken place.  I entered the village, and all my former feelings returned. I cannot,  my dear friend, enter into details, charming as were my sensations:  they would be dull in the narration. I had intended to lodge in the  market-place, near our old house. As soon as I entered, I perceived that  the schoolroom, where our childhood had been taught by that good old  woman, was converted into a shop. I called to mind the sorrow, the  heaviness, the tears, and oppression of heart, which I experienced in  that confinement. Every step produced some particular impression. A  pilgrim in the Holy Land does not meet so many spots pregnant with  tender recollections, and his soul is hardly moved with greater  devotion. One incident will serve for illustration. I followed the  course of a stream to a farm, formerly a delightful walk of mine, and  paused at the spot, where, when boys, we used to amuse ourselves making  ducks and drakes upon the water. I recollected so well how I used  formerly to watch the course of that same stream, following it with  inquiring eagerness, forming romantic ideas of the countries it was to  pass through; but my imagination was soon exhausted: while the  water continued flowing farther and farther on, till my fancy became  bewildered by the contemplation of an invisible distance. Exactly such,  my dear friend, so happy and so confined, were the thoughts of our good  ancestors. Their feelings and their poetry were fresh as childhood.  And, when Ulysses talks of the immeasurable sea and boundless earth,  his epithets are true, natural, deeply felt, and mysterious. Of what  importance is it that I have learned, with every schoolboy, that the  world is round? Man needs but little earth for enjoyment, and still less  for his final repose.    I am at present with the prince at his hunting lodge. He is a man with  whom one can live happily. He is honest and unaffected. There are,  however, some strange characters about him, whom I cannot at all  understand. They do not seem vicious, and yet they do not carry the  appearance of thoroughly honest men. Sometimes I am disposed to believe  them honest, and yet I cannot persuade myself to confide in them. It  grieves me to hear the prince occasionally talk of things which he has  only read or heard of, and always with the same view in which they have  been represented by others.    He values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart, but I  am proud of the latter only. It is the sole source of everything of our  strength, happiness, and misery. All the knowledge I possess every one  else can acquire, but my heart is exclusively my own.    MAY 25.    I have had a plan in my head of which I did not intend to speak to you  until it was accomplished: now that it has failed, I may as well mention  it. I wished to enter the army, and had long been desirous of taking  the step. This, indeed, was the chief reason for my coming here with the  prince, as he is a general in the service. I communicated my design to  him during one of our walks together. He disapproved of it, and it would  have been actual madness not to have listened to his reasons.    JUNE 11.    Say what you will, I can remain here no longer. Why should I remain?  Time hangs heavy upon my hands. The prince is as gracious to me as any  one could be, and yet I am not at my ease. There is, indeed, nothing  in common between us. He is a man of understanding, but quite of the  ordinary kind. His conversation affords me no more amusement than I  should derive from the perusal of a well-written book. I shall remain  here a week longer, and then start again on my travels. My drawings are  the best things I have done since I came here. The prince has a taste  for the arts, and would improve if his mind were not fettered by cold  rules and mere technical ideas. I often lose patience, when, with  a glowing imagination, I am giving expression to art and nature, he  interferes with learned suggestions, and uses at random the technical  phraseology of artists.    JULY 16.    Once more I am a wanderer, a pilgrim, through the world. But what else  are you!    JULY 18.    Whither am I going? I will tell you in confidence. I am obliged to  continue a fortnight longer here, and then I think it would be better  for me to visit the mines in--. But I am only deluding myself thus. The  fact is, I wish to be near Charlotte again, that is all. I smile at the  suggestions of my heart, and obey its dictates.    JULY 29.    No, no! it is yet well all is well! I her husband! O God, who gave me  being, if thou hadst destined this happiness for me, my whole life would  have been one continual thanksgiving! But I will not murmur--forgive  these tears, forgive these fruitless wishes. She--my wife! Oh, the very  thought of folding that dearest of Heaven's creatures in my arms! Dear  Wilhelm, my whole frame feels convulsed when I see"]]]
