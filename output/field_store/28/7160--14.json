If a pueblo is very much concentrated the  population varies at different seasons of the year. In summer it is  sparsely inhabited; in winter it is rather densely populated. While  Palatki and Honanki together had rooms sufficient to house 500 people,  I doubt whether their aggregate population, ever exceeded 200. This  estimate, of course, is based on the supposition that these villages  were contemporaneously inhabited.    The evidences all point to a belief, however, that they were both  permanent dwelling places and not temporary resorts at certain seasons  of the year.    The pictographs on the face of the cliff above Honanki are for the  greater part due to the former Apache occupants of the rooms, and are  situated high above the tops of the walls of the ruin. They are, as a  rule, drawn with white chalk, which shows very clearly on the red  rock, and are particularly numerous above room _g_. The figure of a  circle, with lines crossing one another diametrically and continued as  rays beyond the periphery, possibly represent the sun. Many spiral  figures, almost constant pictographs in cliff ruins, are found in  several places. Another strange design, resembling some kind of  insect, is very conspicuous.    A circle painted green and inclosed in a border of yellow is  undoubtedly of Apache origin. There is at one point a row of small  pits, arranged in line, suggesting a score or enumeration of some  kind, and a series of short parallel lines of similar import was found  not far away. This latter method of recording accounts is commonly  used at the present time in Tusayan, both in houses and on cliffs; and  one of the best of these, said to enumerate the number of Apache  killed by the Hopi in a raid many years ago, may be seen above the  trail by which the visitor enters the pueblo of Hano on the East Mesa.  The names of several persons scratched on the face of the cliff  indicate that Americans had visited Honanki before me.    The majority of the paleoglyphs at both Palatki and Honanki are of  Apache origin, and are of comparatively modern date, as would  naturally be expected. In some instances their colors are as fresh as  if made a few years ago, and there is no doubt that they were drawn  after the building was deserted by its original occupants. The  positions of the pictographs on the cliffs imply that they were drawn  before the roofs and flooring had been destroyed, thus showing how  lately the ruin preserved its ancient form. In their sheltered  position there seems to be no reason why the ancient pictographs  should not have been preserved, and the fact that so few of the  figures pecked in the cliff now remain is therefore instructive.    One of the first tendencies of man in visiting a ruin is to inscribe  his name on its walls or on neighboring cliffs. This is shared by both  Indians and whites, and the former generally makes his totem on the  rock surface, or adds that of his gods, the sun, rain-cloud, or  katcinas. Inscriptions recording events are less common, as they are  more difficult to indicate with exactitude in this system of  pictography. The majority of ancient pictographs in the Red-rock  country, like those I have considered in other parts of Verde valley,  are identical with picture writings now made in Tusayan, and are  recognized and interpreted without hesitation by the Hopi Indians. In  their legends, in which the migrations of their ancestors are  recounted, the traditionists often mention the fact that their  ancestors left their totem signatures at certain points in their  wanderings. The Patki people say that you will find on the rocks of  Palatkwabi, the \"Red Land of the South\" from which they came, totems  of the rain-cloud, sun, crane, parrot, etc. If we find these markings  in the direction which they are thus definitely declared to exist, and  the Hopi say similar pictures were made by their ancestors, there  seems no reason to question such circumstantial evidence that some of  the Hopi clans once came from this region.[28]    One of the most interesting of the pictographs pecked in the rock is a  figure which, variously modified, is a common decoration on  cliff-dweller pottery from the Verde valley region to the ruins of the  San Juan and its tributaries. This figure has the form of two  concentric spirals, the ends of which do not join. As this design  assumes many modifications, it may be well to consider a few forms  which it assumes on the pottery of the cliff people and on that of  their descendants, the Pueblos.    The so-called black-and-white ware, or white pottery decorated with  black lines, which is so characteristic of the ceramics of the  cliff-dwellers, is sometimes, as we shall see, found in ruins like  Awatobi and Sikyatki; but it is so rare, as compared with other  varieties, that it may be regarded as intrusive.    One of the simplest forms of the broken-line motive is a Greek fret,  in which there is a break in the component square figures or where the  line is noncontinuous. In the simplest form, which appears prominently  on modern pottery, but which is rare or wanting on true  black-and-white ware, we have two crescentic figures, the concavities  of which face in different directions, but the horns overlap. This is  a symbol which the participants in the dance called the Humiskatcina  still paint with pigments on their breasts, and which is used on  shields and various religious paraphernalia.    A study of any large collection of decorated Pueblo ware, ancient or  modern, will show many modifications of this broken line, a number of  which I shall discuss more in detail when pottery ornamentation is  considered. A design so distinctive and so widespread as this must  certainly have a symbolic interpretation. The concentric spirals with  a broken line, the Hopi say, are symbols of the whirlpool, and it is  interesting to find in the beautiful plates of Chavero's _Antigueedades  Mexicanas_ that the water in the lagoon surrounding the ancient Aztec  capital was indicated by the Nahuatl Indians with similar symbols.      OBJECTS FOUND AT PALATKI AND HONANKI    The isolation of these ruins and the impossibility of obtaining  workmen, combined with the brief visit which I was able to make to  them, rendered it impossible to collect very many specimens of ancient  handiwork. The few excavations which were made were limited almost  wholly to Honanki, and from their success I can readily predict a rich  harvest for anyone who may attempt systematic work in this virgin  field. We naturally chose the interior of the rooms for excavation,  and I will say limited our work to these places. Every chamber was  more or less filled with debris--fragments of overturned walls,  detached rock from the cliff above, dry alkaline soil, drifted sand,  dust, and animal excreta. In those places where digging was possible  we found the dust and guano so dry and alkaline that it was next to  impossible to work for any length of time in the rooms, for the air  became so impure that the workmen could hardly breathe, especially  where the inclosing walls prevented ventilation. Notwithstanding this  obstacle, however, we removed the accumulated debris down to the floor  in one or two chambers, and examined with care the various objects of  aboriginal origin which were revealed.    In studying the specimens found in cliff-houses due attention has not  always been given to the fact that occupants have oftentimes camped in  them subsequently to their abandonment by the original builders. As a  consequence of this temporary habitation objects owned by unrelated  Indians have frequently been confused with those of the cliff-dwellers  proper. We found evidences that both Honanki and Palatki had been  occupied by Apache Mohave people for longer or shorter periods of  time, and some of the specimens were probably left there by these  inhabitants.    The ancient pottery found in the rooms, although fragmentary, is  sufficiently complete to render a comparison with known ceramics from  the Verde ruins. Had we discovered the cemeteries, for which we  zealously searched in vain, no doubt entire vessels, deposited as  mortuary offerings, would have been found; but the kind of ware of  which they were made would undoubtedly have been the same as that of  the fragments.    No pottery distinctively different from that which has already been  reported from the Verde valley ruins was found, and the majority  resembled so closely in texture and symbolism that of the cliff houses  of the San Juan, in northern New Mexico and southern Utah, that they  may be regarded as practically identical.    The following varieties of pottery were found at Honanki:      I. Coiled ware.   II. Indented ware.  III. Smooth ware.   IV. Smooth ware painted white, with black geometric figures.    V. Smooth red ware, with black decoration.    By far the largest number of fragments belong to the first division,  and these, as a rule, are blackened by soot, as if used in cooking.  The majority are parts of large open-mouth jars with flaring rims,  corrugated or often indented with the thumb-nail or some hard  substance, the coil becoming obscure on the lower surface. The inside  of these jars is smooth, but never polished, and in one instance the  potter used the corrugations of the coil as an ornamental motive. The  paste of which this coiled ware was composed is coarse, with  argillaceous grains scattered through it; but it was well fired and is  still hard and durable. When taken in connection with its tenuity,  these features show a highly developed potter's technique. A single  fragment is ornamented with an S-shape coil of clay fastened to the  corrugations in much the same way as in similar ware from the ruins  near the Colorado Chiquito.    The fragments of smooth ware show that they, too, had been made  originally in the same way as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23692"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 1 (of 8) (#14)"],[1,"Africa to a successful termination.\" On the 19th of March 1879  the Secretary of the Colonies wrote to Sir Bartle Frere, to the  effect that Ministers were unable to find, on the documents placed  before them, \"that evidence of urgent necessity for immediate action  which alone would justify him in taking, without their full  knowledge and sanction, a course almost certain to result in a war.\"    The day for discussion of South African affairs in the Upper House  arrived.    Lord Lansdowne moved, on the 11th of March, \"That this House, while  willing to support her Majesty's Government in all necessary  measures for defending the possessions of her Majesty in South  Africa, regrets that the _ultimatum_, which was calculated to  produce immediate war, should have been presented to the Zulu king  without authority from the responsible advisers of the Crown, and  that an offensive war should have been commenced without imperative  and pressing necessity or adequate preparation; and the House  regrets that, after the censure passed upon the High Commissioner by  her Majesty's Government, in the despatch of March 19, 1879, the  conduct of affairs in South Africa should be retained in his hands.\"    A keen debate ensued. The Opposition clamoured for the recall of Sir  Bartle Frere, as the example of independent action set by him might  be followed by other and more distant representatives of the Crown.  The war was ascribed to Lord Carnarvon's impatience for South  African confederation and his \"incurable greed\" for extending the  limits of the Colonies, and the annexation of the Transvaal was  declared to be a mistake, unless the Government was prepared to send  out a large military force to South Africa.    The Government combated these arguments. They denied they had  censured Sir Bartle Frere, and stated that they had passed no  opinion on his policy, but merely asserted as a principle that \"Her  Majesty's advisers, and they only, must decide the grave issues of  peace and war.\"    It was argued that war with Cetchwayo was inevitable sooner or  later, and that the Lord High Commissioner had thought it advisable  to be prompt in the matter. His conduct, it was true, had not the  entire approval of the Ministry, but every one knew it was unwise to  change horses in crossing a stream, and his action had not been such  as to outweigh the many considerations which required the  continuance of his service in South Africa.    Lord Beaconsfield, addressing the House, defended Sir Bartle Frere,  and expressed opinions on the policy of confederation as opposed to  that of annexation, opinions which afford so much instruction in  regard to our relations with the Transvaal that they are best  repeated in their entirety.    \"I generally find,\" he said, \"there is one advantage at the end of a  debate, besides the relief which is afforded by its termination, and  that is that both sides of the House seem pretty well agreed as to  the particular point that really is at issue; but the rich humour of  the noble duke (Duke of Somerset) has again diverted us from the  consideration of the motion really before the House. If the noble  duke and his friends were desirous of knowing what was the policy  which her Majesty's Government were prepared generally to pursue in  South Africa, if they were prepared to challenge the policy of Sir  Bartle Frere in all its details, I should have thought they would  have produced a very different motion from that which is now lying  on your lordships' table; for that is a motion of a most limited  character, and, according to the strict rules of parliamentary  discussion, precludes you from most of the subjects which have  lately been introduced to our consideration, and which principally  have emanated from noble lords opposite. We have not been summoned  here to-day to consider the policy of the acquisition of the  Transvaal. These are subjects on which I am sure the Government  would be prepared to address your lordships, if their conduct were  clearly and fairly impugned. And with regard to the annexation of  the province, which has certainly very much filled the mouths of men  of late, I can easily conceive that that would have been a subject  for fair discussion in this House, and we should have heard, as we  have heard to-night, though in a manner somewhat unexpected, from  the nature of the resolution before us, from the noble lord who was  recently the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the principal  reasons which induced the Government to sanction that policy--a  policy which I believe can be defended, but which has not been  impugned to-night in any formal manner.    \"What has been impugned to-night is the conduct of the Government in  sanctioning, not the policy of Sir Bartle Frere, but his taking a  most important step without consulting them, which on such subjects  is the usual practice with all Governments. But the noble lord  opposite who introduced the subject does not even impugn the policy  of the Lord High Commissioner; and it was left to the noble duke who  has just addressed us, and who ought to have brought forward this  question if his views are so strongly entertained by him on the  matter, not in supporting a resolution such as now lies on your  lordships' table, but one which would have involved a discussion of  the policy of the Government and that of the high officer who is  particularly interested in it.    \"My noble friend, the noble marquis (Lord Salisbury), who very  recently addressed the House, touched the real question which is  before us, and it is a very important question, although it is not  of the expansive character of the one which would have been  justified by the comments of the noble lords opposite. What we have  to decide to-night is this--whether her Majesty's Government shall  have the power of recommending to the sovereign the employment of a  high officer to fulfil duties of the utmost importance, or whether  that exercise of the prerogative, on their advice, shall be  successfully impugned, and that appointment superseded by noble  lords opposite. That course is perfectly constitutional, if they are  prepared to take the consequences. But let it be understood what the  issue is. It is this--that a censure upon the Government is called  for, because they have selected the individual who, on the whole,  they think is the best qualified successfully to fulfil the duties  of High Commissioner. The noble lords opposite made that  proposition, and if they succeed they will succeed in that which has  hitherto been considered one of the most difficult tasks of the  executive Government; that is to say, they will supersede the  individual whom the sovereign, in the exercise of her prerogative,  under the advice of her Ministers, has selected for an important  post. I cannot agree in the general remark made by the noble duke,  that because an individual has committed an error, and even a  considerable error, for that reason, without any reference either to  his past services or his present qualifications, immediately a  change should be recommended, and he should be recalled from the  scene of his duties.    \"I remember myself a case not altogether different from the present  one,\" continued Lord Beaconsfield, alluding to Sir James Hudson, who,  when Minister at Turin, had been charged with having expressed himself  unguardedly upon the subject of Italian nationality. \"It happened some  years ago, when I was in the other House. Then a very high official--a  diplomatist of great eminence, a member of the Liberal party--had  committed what was deemed a great indiscretion by several members of his  own party; and the Government were asked in a formal manner, by a  Liberal member, whether that distinguished diplomatist had been in  consequence recalled. But the person who was then responsible for the  conduct of public affairs in that House--the humble individual who is  now addressing your lordships, made this answer, with the full  concurrence of his colleagues--denied that that distinguished  diplomatist was recalled, and said that _great services are not  cancelled by one act or one single error however it may be regretted at  the moment_. That is what I said then, with regard to Sir James Hudson,  and what I say now with regard to Sir Bartle Frere. But I do not wish  to rest on that. I confess that, so keen is my sense of responsibility,  and that of my colleagues, and I am sure also that of noble lords  opposite, that we would not allow our decisions in such matters to be  unduly influenced by personal considerations of any kind. What we had to  determine is this, Was it wise that such an act on the part of Sir  Bartle Frere as, in fact, commencing war without consulting the  Government at home, and without their sanction, should be passed  unnoticed? Ought it not to be noticed in a manner which should convey to  that eminent person a clear conviction of the feelings of her Majesty's  Government; and at the same time was it not their duty to consider, were  he superseded, whether they could place in his position an individual  equally qualified to fulfil the great duties and responsibilities  resting on him? That is what we had to consider. We considered it  entirely with reference to the public interest, and the public interest  alone; and we arrived at the conviction that on the whole the retention  of Sir Bartle Frere in that position was our duty, notwithstanding the  inconvenient observations and criticisms to which we were, of course,  conscious it might subject us. And, that being our conviction, we have  acted upon it. It is a very easy thing for a Government to make a  scapegoat; but that is conduct which I hope no gentleman on this side,  and I believe no gentleman sitting opposite, would easily adopt. If Sir  Bartle Frere had been recalled--if he had been recalled in deference to  the panic, the thoughtless panic of the hour, in"]]]
