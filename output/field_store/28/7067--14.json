The strictest etiquette appeared to be kept  up at the sheikh's court; but the major and his companions declined  doing more in the way of reverence than bending their heads and laying  their right-hands on their hearts.  They found the sheikh sitting on a  carpet, in a small, dark room.  He was plainly dressed in a blue _tobe_  of Soudan and a small turban, with armed negroes on either side of him,  and weapons hung up on the walls.  His personal appearance was  prepossessing, and he had an expressive countenance and a benevolent  smile.    After he had received the letter from the pacha, he enquired what was  their object in coming.  They answered, to see the country and to give  an account of its inhabitants, produce and appearance, as their sultan  was desirous of knowing every part of the globe.  His reply was that  they were welcome, and whatever he could show them would give him  pleasure.    Huts had been built for them and an abundance of provisions was  provided, though the number of their visitors gave them not a moment's  peace, while the heat was insufferable.    Next day they had another audience, to deliver their presents.  With the  firearms, especially, the sheikh was highly delighted, and he showed  evident satisfaction on their assuring him that the king of England had  heard of Bornou and himself.  Immediately turning to his councillors, he  observed: \"This is in consequence of our defeating the Begharmis.\"  Upon  this the chief who had most distinguished himself in this memorable  battle, Bagah Furby, demanded: \"Did he ever hear of me?\"  The reply of  \"Certainly!\" did wonders for their cause.  \"Ah, then your king must be a  great man!\" was re-echoed from every side.    Every morning, besides presents of bullocks, camel-loads of wheat and  rice, leather skins of butter, jars of honey, and wooden bowls  containing rice with meat, and paste made of barley flour--savoury, but  very greasy--were sent to them.    In a short time--by the exhibition of rockets, a musical box, and other  wonders--Denham appeared to have entirely won the sheikh's confidence.  Reports, however, had been going about that the English had come to spy  out the land, and intended to build ships on Lake Chad, in which they  would sail about and conquer the surrounding country.  Reports were now  received that the Begharmis were approaching Bornou, and it was said  that the sheikh would immediately send a force into their country, in  order to punish their sultan for even thinking of revenge.    The sheikh, in the meantime, had given them leave to visit all the towns  in his dominions, but on no account to go beyond them.  He asked many  questions about the English manner of attacking a walled town; and, on  hearing that they had guns which carried ball of thirty-two pounds'  weight, with which the walls were breached, and that then the place was  taken by assault, his large dark eyes sparkled again, as he exclaimed:  \"Wonderful! wonderful!\"    Although the sheikh was the real ruler of the country, he allowed the  existence of the hereditary sultan, a mere puppet, who resided at  Birnie.  Boo-Khaloum advised that they should pay their respects to this  sovereign; and they accordingly set out for the place, which contained  about ten thousand inhabitants.  They were first conducted to the gate  of the sultan's mud edifice, where a few of the court were assembled to  receive them.  One, a sort of chamberlain, habited in eight or ten  _tobes_, or shirts, of different colours, carried an immense staff, and  on his head was a turban of prodigious size, though but a trifling one  compared to those they were destined to see at the audience on the  following morning.  A large marquee was pitched for their reception,  which they found luxuriously cool.  In the evening a plentiful repast  was brought them, consisting of seventy dishes, each of which would have  dined half-a-dozen persons with moderate appetites; and for fear the  English should not eat like the Bornouy, a slave or two arrived loaded  with live fowls for their dinner.    Soon after daylight the next morning they were summoned to attend the  sultan.  He received them in an open space in front of the royal  residence.  They were compelled to stop at a considerable distance from  him, while his own people approached to within about a hundred yards,  passing first on horseback, and, after dismounting and prostrating  themselves before him, they took their places on the ground in front,  but with their backs to the royal person.  He was seated in a sort of  cage made of cane, on a throne which appeared to be covered with silk or  satin.  Nothing could be more absurd and grotesque than the figures who  formed his court.  The sheikh, to make himself popular with all parties,  allowed the sultan to be amused by indulging in all the folly and  bigotry of the ancient negro sovereigns.  Large bellies and large heads  are considered the proper attributes of the courtiers, and those who do  not possess the former by nature, make up the deficiency of protuberance  by a wadding, which, as they sit on horseback, gives them a most  extraordinary appearance, while the head is enveloped in folds of muslin  or linen of various colours, of such size as to make the head appear  completely on one side.  The turbans are, besides, hung all-over with  charms enclosed in little red leather bags.  The horse is also adorned  in the same manner.    When the courtiers had taken their seats, the visitors were desired to  sit down.  On this, the ugliest black that can be imagined, the only  person who approached the sultan's seat, asked for the presents.  Boo-Khaloum produced them, enclosed in a large shawl, and they were  carried unopened into the presence of the sultan.  The English, by some  omission, had brought no presents.    A little to their left was an extemporary declaimer, shouting forth the  praises of his master, with his pedigree, and near him stood a man with  a long, wooden trumpet, on which he ever and anon blew a blast.    Nothing could be more ridiculous than the appearance of these people,  squatting down in their places, tottering under the weight and magnitude  of their turbans and their bellies, while the thin legs that appeared  underneath but ill accorded with the bulk of the other part.    Immediately after the ceremony the travellers took their departure for  Angornou, a town containing at least thirty thousand inhabitants.  The  market-place was crowded with people, and there were a number of  beggars.  Linen was so cheap that all the men wore shirts and trousers;  but the beggars were seen holding up the arms of an old pair of the  latter, touching the shirt at the same time, and exclaiming: \"But  breeches there are none; but breeches there are none.\"  This novel mode  of drawing the attention of the passers-by so amused Denham that he  could not help laughing outright.    He was, however, anxious to visit a large river to the southward of  Kouka, called the Shary; but was delayed by Dr Oudney's serious  illness, and the unsettled state of Book-Haloum's affairs with the  Arabs; indeed, so mutinous had some of these become, that he was at last  compelled to send thirty of them back again to Fezzan.    Hillman had greatly pleased the sheikh by manufacturing a couple of  chests, and he was now requested to make a sort of litter, such as the  sheikh had heard were used by the sultans of Fezzan.    Among other presents, the sheikh sent them a young lion about three  months old.  It was a tame, good-natured creature, but as Denham was  under the necessity of refusing the animal a corner of his hut, it was  immediately in consequence killed.    During the illness of his companions Major Denham made an excursion to  the shores of Lake Chad, accompanied by Maraymy, an intelligent black,  to whose charge he had been committed by the sheikh, where numerous  elephants and some beautiful antelopes were seen.  The sheikh's people,  as they came near the elephants, began screeching violently.  The  animals, though moving a little away, erected their ears, and gave a  roar that shook the ground under them.  One was an immense fellow.  The  party wheeled swiftly round him, and Maraymy casting a spear at him,  which struck him just under the tail, the huge brute threw up his  proboscis in the air with a loud roar, and from it cast such a volume of  sand as nearly to blind the major, who was approaching at the time.    The elephant rarely if ever attacks, but, when irritated, he will  sometimes rush upon a man on horseback, and, after choking him with  dust, destroy him in a moment.    Pursued by the horsemen, the animal made off at a clumsy, rolling walk,  but sufficient to keep the steeds at a full gallop.  The major fired  twice at fifty yards' distance.  The first shot which struck the animal  failed to make the least impression, and the second, though wounding him  in the ear, seemed to give him a moment's uneasiness only.  After  another spear had been darted at him, which flew off his rough hide  without exciting the least sensation, the elephant made his escape.    The Shooas, the original inhabitants of the country, are great hunters.  Mounted on horseback, a Shooa hunter seeks the buffalo in the swampy  regions near the lake, and, driving the animal he has selected to the  firm ground, rides on till he gets close alongside, when, springing up,  he stands with one foot on his horse and the other on the back of the  buffalo, through which he plunges his spear, driving it with tremendous  force into its heart.    Denham heard of people called Kerdies, who inhabited islands far away in  the eastern part of the lake.  They frequently make plundering  excursions even close up to Angornou, and carry off cattle and people in  their canoes, no means being taken to oppose them.    The sheikh was very unwilling that his white visitor should cross the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21400"],[0,"Style in Singing (#14)"],[1,"imetic, side of lyric art.  Too much importance is, in my opinion, attached to the latter branch,  at the cost of the former. I repeat, an opera-singer should be a  singer who acts, not an actor who sings.           *       *       *       *       *    On the occasion of the bestowal of awards at the Paris Conservatoire  in August, 1905, M. Dujardin-Beaumetz, Under-Secretary for the Fine  Arts, in his address to the students made pointed allusion to the  difference of results between the instrumental classes and those for  singing. Said the orator: \"It is claimed that singing is in a state of  decadence, and that the cause is largely due to the style of modern  music. It is rather owing to the fact that this art is not studied at  present with the same methodic diligence that formerly obtained. I  would remind the students of singing that they gain nothing by  neglecting the earlier studies, and that their professional future  would be better assured if it rested on a solid basis of vocal  technique. It is, therefore, in their interest that, with a view to  assure this important point, certain reforms will be instituted.\"[6]    [Footnote 6: One of these reforms was that the first year's study is  to be devoted entirely to tone-formation; no attention being paid to  the employment of the tones in melody. Nor are the professors of  singing at the Conservatoire now selected--as was formerly the  case--exclusively from among ex-opera-singers.]    The professors of the classes for singing were also advised to draw  more on the great classic writers for the voice, instead of confining  themselves principally to the operatic repertoire.    Every art reaches its apex of perfection, and then seems to decline;  it may even temporarily disappear. But, being immortal, it is never  lost. It finds other modes of manifestation, and reappears in other  forms. The principles on which it is founded do not change; but  constantly changing conditions necessitate a new application of these  principles. This necessity was acknowledged for poetry itself by Andre  Chenier:    \"_Sur des pensees nouveaux, faisons des vers antiques._\" (Let us  embody modern thoughts in classic verse.)    Music follows the great laws of development to which all things are  subject. It would be foolish, nay, impossible, to try to resuscitate  an old form of art. Foolish, because the art itself would have lost  all except its archaic charm or interest; impossible, because  conditions have so completely changed that the attempt would be merely  the galvanizing of a corpse, not its reanimation.    Similarly, the art of singing can be successful only in proportion as  it recognizes the existence of other conditions. These it meets by  observing the old principles, but changing their mode of application.    The education of the singer of to-day requires to be conducted on  broader and more comprehensive lines than in the past, on account of  the different conditions which have presented themselves.  Singing--that is, the alliance and utterance of Music and Poetry--is  one of the highest manifestations of the Beautiful, and is man's  supreme and greatest creation. Therefore, singing will not seek in  future to rival a mechanical instrument. It will, it is evident, give  to the poetic idea a prominent, though not a predominant, place. But  this poetic idea can be revealed to the listener only by a singer who  is master of all the technical phases of his art. These component  parts of his vocal education must of necessity comprise--as was laid  down in the opening chapter of this work--Pose of Voice, Technique,  Style, and Repertoire.    It has been demonstrated that the first of these elements is  essential, because the other stones of the complete structure cannot  be successfully laid on an insecure foundation. The singer must have  the second, or he will be unable to materialize his concept, like an  unskilled carver who possesses the necessary material and tools, but  lacks the technical ability to utilize either. He must possess Colour,  whereby his vocal palette is set with the varied tints necessary for  the different sentiments to be expressed; Accent, so that character  may be given to the music and appropriate emphasis to the text; and  Phrasing, in order that he may punctuate the music effectively and the  words intelligently.    Perfect master of these, he is in possession of all that goes to make  up Style. And, if these premises be accepted, it must be evident that  he is in possession of the qualities that were necessary to make  singers great in the past, and are indispensable to make them great in  the future."]]]
