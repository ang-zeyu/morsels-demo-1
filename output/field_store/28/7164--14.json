Not long afterward the same prince came to him for advice in  regard to the best manner of controlling the violence of those  transports of affection towards his young and amiable consort, in which  young and happy lovers are so apt to indulge. 'My dear friend,' said  Zimmerman, 'there is no expedient which can surpass your own. Whenever  you feel yourself overborne by passion, you have only to repeat the  Lord's prayer, and you will be able to reduce it to a steady and  permanent flame.'    By adopting Zimmerman's rule, we shall, as I have already observed,  gain time for reflection, than which nothing more is needed. For if the  cause of anger be a report, for example, of injury done to us by an  absent person, either in words or deeds, how do we know the report is  true? Or it may be only partly true; and how do we know, till we  consider the matter well, whether it is worth our anger at all? Or if  at all, perhaps it deserves but a little of it. It may be, too, that  the person who said or did the thing reported, did it by mistake, or is  already sorry for it. At all events, nothing can be gained by haste;  much _may_ be by delay.    If a passionate person give you ill language, you ought rather to pity  than be angry with him, for anger is a species of disease. And to  correct one evil, will you make another? If his being angry is an evil,  will it mend the matter to make _another_ evil, by indulging in passion  yourself? Will it cure his disease, to throw yourself into the same  distemper? But if not, then how foolish is it to indulge improper  feelings at all!    On the same principles, and for the same reasons, you should avoid  returning railing for railing; or reviling for reproach. It only  kindles the more heat. Besides, you will often find silence, or at  least very gentle words, as in the case of the Quaker just mentioned,  the best return for reproaches which could be devised. I say the best  'return;' but I would not be understood as justifying any species of  _revenge_. The kind of _return_ here spoken of is precisely that  treatment which will be most likely to cure the distemper in the other,  by making him see, and be sorry for, his passion.    If the views taken in this section be true, it is easy to see the  consummate folly of all violence, whether between individuals or  collective bodies, whether it be by _striking_, _duelling_, or _war_.  For if an individual or a nation has done wrong, will it annihilate  that wrong to counteract it by _another_ wrong? Is it not obvious that  it only makes two evils, where but one existed before? And can two  _wrongs_ ever make one _right_ action? Which is the most rational, when  the choice is in our power, to add to one existing evil, another of  similar or greater magnitude; or to keep quiet, and let the world have  but one cup of misery instead of two?    Besides, the language of Scripture is _every where_ full and decided on  this point. 'Recompense to no man evil for evil,' and 'wo to him by  whom the offence cometh,' though found but once or twice in just so  many words, are in fact, some of the more prominent doctrines of the  New Testament; and I very much doubt whether you can read many pages,  in succession, in any part of the bible, without finding this great  principle enforced. The daily example of the Saviour, and the apostles  and early Christians, is a full confirmation of it, in practice.          CHAPTER II.    On the Management of Business.      SECTION I. _On commencing Business._    Young men are usually in haste to commence business for themselves.  This is an evil, and one which appears to me to be increasing. Let me  caution my readers to be on their guard against it.    The evils of running in debt will be adverted to elsewhere. I mention  the subject in this place, because the earlier you commence business,  the greater the necessity of resorting to credit. You may, indeed, in  some employments, begin on a very small scale; but this is attended  with serious disadvantages, especially at the present day, when you  must meet with so much competition. Perhaps a few may be furnished with  capital by their friends, or by inheritance. In the latter case they  may as well _use_ their money, if they receive it; but I have already  endeavored to show that it is generally for the interest of young men  to rely upon their own exertions. It is extremely difficult for a  person who has ever relied on others, to act with the same energy as  those who have been thrown upon their own resources.[4] To learn the  art of inheriting property or receiving large gifts, and of acting with  the same energy as if left wholly to our own resources, must be  reserved, I believe, for future and wiser generations of our race.    I repeat it, therefore, every person had better defer going into  business for himself, until he can stand entirely on his own footing.  Is it asked how he can have funds from his own resources, before he has  actually _commenced_ business for himself? Why the thing is perfectly  easy. He has only to labor a few years in the service of another. True  it is, he may receive but moderate wages during this time; but on the  other hand, he will be subjected to little or no risk.    Let 1,000 young men, at the age of 30 years, enter into business with a  given amount of capital, all acquired by their own hard earnings, and  let them pursue their business 30 years faithfully; that is, till they  are 60 years of age. Let 1,000 others commence at the age of 20, with  three times the amount of capital possessed by the former, but at the  same time either inherited, or loaned by their friends, and let them  pursue their calling till _they_ are 60 years of age; or for a period  of 40 years. We will suppose the natural talents, capacity for doing  business, and expenditures--in fact every thing,--the same, in both  cases. Now it requires no gift of prophecy to foretell, with certainty,  that at 60 years of age a far greater proportion of the 1,000, who  began at 30 and depended solely on their own exertions, will be men of  wealth, than of those who began at 20 with three times their capital.  The reason of these results is found in the very nature of things, as I  have shown both above, and in my remarks on industry.    But these views are borne out by facts. Go into any city in the United  States, and learn the history of the men who are engaged in active and  profitable business, and are thriving in the world, and my word for it,  you will find the far greater part began life with nothing, and have  had no resources whatever but their own head and hands. And in no city  is this fact more strikingly verified than in Boston. On the other  hand, if you make a list of those who fail in business from year to  year, and learn their history, you will find that a very large  proportion of them relied on inheritances, credit, or some kind of  foreign aid in early life;--and not a few begun very young.    There is no doctrine in this volume, which will be more unpopular with  its readers, than this. Not a few will, I fear, utterly disbelieve it.  They look at the exterior appearance of some young friend, a little  older than themselves, who has been _lifted_ into business and gone on  a year or two, and all appears fair and encouraging. They long to  imitate him. Point them to a dozen others who have gone only a little  farther, and have made shipwreck, and it weighs nothing or next to  nothing with them. They suspect mismanagement, (which doubtless  sometimes exists) and think _they_ shall act more wisely.    In almost every considerable shop in this country may be found young  men who have nearly served out their time as apprentices, or perhaps  have gone a little farther, even, and worked a year or two as  journeymen. They have been industrious and frugal, and have saved a few  hundred dollars. This, on the known principles of human nature, has  created a strong desire to make additions; and the desire has increased  in a greater ratio than the sum. They are good workmen, perhaps, or if  not, they generally think so; and those who have the least merit,  generally have the most confidence in themselves. But if there be one  who _has_ merit, there is usually in the neighborhood some hawk-eyed  money dealer, who knows that he cannot better invest his funds than in  the hands of active young men. This man will search him out, and offer  to set him up in business; and his friends, pleased to have him  noticed, give security for payment. Thus flattered, he commonly begins;  and after long patience and perseverance, he may, by chance, succeed.  But a much greater number are unsuccessful, and a few drown their cares  and perplexities in the poisoned bowl, or in debauchery;--perhaps  both--thus destroying their minds and souls; or, it may be, abruptly  putting an end to their own existence.    Young men are apt to reason thus with themselves. 'I am now arrived at  an age when others have commenced business and succeeded. It is true I  may not succeed; but I know of no reason why my prospects are not as  good as those of A, B, and C, to say the least. I am certainly as good  a workman, and know as well how to manage, and attend to my own  concerns, without intermeddling with those of others. It is true my  friends advise me to work as a journeyman a few years longer; but it is  a hard way of living. Besides, what shall I learn all this while, that  I do not already know? They say I shall be improving in the _practical_  part of my business, if not in the _theory_ of it. But shall I not  improve while I work for myself? Suppose I make blunders. Have not  others done the same? If I fall, I must get up again. Perhaps it will  teach me not to stumble again. The fact is, old people never think the  young know or can do any thing till they are forty years old. I am  determined to make an effort.

It is strange indeed  to find how comparative are all our standards of luxury; on that day you  could have seen what Mr. Dooley might call the \"flowers of the British  aristocracy\" splashing and rejoicing in filthy, muddy water beside  Kaffirs and drinking mules; and no one who bathed on that day, after  many days of wearing the same clothes and being impregnated with sand  and sun, is likely to forget the luxury of the bath.    The discomforts of a hurried march are many, and the feeling of  uncleanness is not the least of them; yet one recalls with pleasure the  long days spent dozing along on one's horse at the head of a marching  column that stretched seven miles over the plain and hills behind. Let  me try to describe some of the circumstances of the march from Poplar  Grove to Dreifontein. It must be remembered that these are but the names  of farms, and that a farm means often nothing more than a mud house, a  few trees, and a well of water.    Long before it was light we were awakened by the cries of Kaffirs  collecting their ox teams and by the almost human complaints of many  mules; and while we breakfasted by lamplight in the dim grove where our  camp was pitched a stream of transport was already flowing out of the  mass surrounding us on all sides. We started later, when the line along  the east, crimson at first, had changed from saffron to bright gold, and  the head of the column was already out of sight, melting towards the  sunrise in a cloud of dust. The mounted infantry brigade, which  furnished the patrols and screens, was already away scouring the plain  in advance of the column, but the thin line of waggons was broken now by  the broad shape of infantry brigades, marching fifty deep across the  grass.    Our own small convoy was not got under weigh without many pains. The two  newspapers which it represented were the proprietors of many and  various beasts. Six riding ponies for the three correspondents, two  horses for the despatch-rider, six horses to draw an American waggon and  two Cape carts, and six oxen to draw an ox cart laden with forage. No  tongue can tell the anxiety caused by those fourteen horses. No more  could be bought, and if anything happened to them our usefulness would  be at an end. I have often arisen during the night and walked down what  we called our \"lines,\" counting the beasts, and feeling like Abraham. To  be sure, one of the horses cost but thirty shillings; we bought him from  a Kaffir whose honesty I should be sorry to vouch for, but he could  pull, and he lived more than a fortnight. For another one I paid a  sovereign at Osfontein, but observing that he did not eat his supper one  night I gently pushed him away a good hundred yards so that he should  not die close to us.    By the time breakfast had been eaten, the oxen caught, the horses  counted, the differences of six jealous servants adjusted, and the carts  packed, we were ready to move off. Then the sun came up and the day  began, and one could canter up to the front of the column, clear of the  dust. On some days one rode up and down, visiting different regiments  or finding out friends who were trudging beside their companies; but on  the day of this march my pony was tired, and I let him amble along in  front of the Guards for the whole eighteen miles.    I wish I could describe for people who have never seen it the grand and  majestic march of 30,000 men with their guns and baggage across a large  country; the slow dignity of a vast seven-mile column winding over the  face of a plain, all the units diverging to pass the same ant-heap or to  avoid the same rough place. After the first few miles it is silent, and  one hears behind one only the sweep of many feet upon the grass. It is  like Fate, or, say, Time with his scythe held steady; the thing comes  and passes and is gone; but ride backward and you shall see the traces  of its passage. Grass downtrodden that shall rise again, little flowers  bruised that shall renew their blossoms; and still the birds singing  peacefully, the hares leaping, the manifold petty life of the veldt  resuming its routine and circumstance. One passes on through the quaking  air as in a dream, and as though impelled by the great force behind; and  to eyes gazing long on the ground the affairs of tiny creatures become  conspicuous and important. The mere-cats sit listening, and wonder what  the new sound in the grass means, not like wind or rain. Little lizards  basking on the sand suddenly wake up and wriggle away to avoid the thing  against which the shelter of a leaf will not avail them. And always in  front hares and buck by the hundred stream away like the shadows of  clouds over grass. Then someone looks at his watch and shouts \"Halt!\"  and the welcome word is shouted and repeated down the line until the  sound is lost in the distance, while the tired men throw themselves down  between the burning sun and the sand.    It is like sailing on a wide sea after a storm, when the short and high  waves have died away beneath the tread of smooth rollers. The veldt  undulates from sky to sky, a plain rising and falling about the base of  rocks and island kopjes. One reaches the crest, hoping for a new view,  searching for the clump of trees that means a farm and fresh water; and  one sinks down again into the furrow, while the wave of disappointment  runs backward along the seven miles of column as each man rises to the  barren view. Now an ox, now a mule or a horse falls out and lies down to  die; now a man stumbles and falls, and lies down to wait for the cool  hours.    To men who find this kind of monotony irksome the march is a dreary  business, while to others its bare outline is filled with the interest  of a thousand little happenings. The tired, dusty, shabby \"Tommy\" is a  man much more agreeable to talk with than his ancestor of the  barrack-room at home; the youngest subaltern has forgotten all about his  swagger mess-kit and the \"style\" of his regiment, and shows himself as  the good fellow he is; even the Brigadier forgets the scarlet on his  khaki collar, and remembers that he too is a frail mortal. And always,  when other interest failed, one could fall back on that of one's own  sometimes troublesome affairs. On the afternoon of the Dreifontein march  our advance cart with the luncheon had not outspanned fifteen minutes  before it was discovered that one of the horses was gone. There was no  doubt as to why, of course--a soldier had \"snaffled\" it. I am sorry to  say that in the matter of horse property the average Tommy holds vague  moral views. That cart had to be brought into camp by night, and there  was only one way in which it could be done. I rode about for ten  minutes, and found an old framework so thin and so dejected that I  blushed when I put the halter on it; it had been abandoned on account  of lameness, from which it had recovered, and had since been starving.  They harnessed it up and it brought in the cart; and that night, being  given a good feed of oats, it died from shock. Another skeleton was  found in the morning to take its place; but this skeleton grew fat. We  used to laugh at these misfortunes, but the poor horses had a cruel  time, especially the English ones; no one would have recognised the  Horse Artillery, although the tragic skeletons that drew the guns still  affected some imitation of their old dash. All the way from Modder to  Bloemfontein was strewn with the bodies of horses; if all other marks  had been gone, these melancholy quarter-mile posts would have guided you  unerringly.    It was night as a rule before the column reached its camp, and there  were some gorgeous pictures in the great outspanning commotion seen  through dust clouds and the red sunset, and by light of many camp fires.  But on this bit of the march we found our quarters sooner than we  expected; and it was early in the afternoon when, climbing the ridge of  undulating plain, I saw the smoke of a shell bursting on the hillside  five miles away, and knew that our day's march, though not our day's  work, was at an end.          XI    THE BATTLE OF DREIFONTEIN AND THE MARCH ON BLOEMFONTEIN      A great chain of kopjes barred the horizon ahead of us, and we came to  the usual conclusion that the Boers were opposing our advance. It is  well to remember that Lord Roberts's army was not marching in a single  column, but in three separate columns, of which the Cavalry Division was  marching on a road about six miles to the north, and the Seventh  Division by a road about four miles to the south of the main body.  General French was a day's march ahead of the main army, and on this  morning he reached Abraham's Kraal (the most northerly hill of the chain  held by the Boers) at ten o'clock, while the Ninth Division did not  arrive until four o'clock. It will thus be seen that one end of the  position was a couple of hours' ride distant from the other and far out  of sight of it.    No one saw the whole of the battle of Dreifontein. General French, when  he arrived at ten in the morning, came into contact with the Boers at  Abraham's Kraal, and (the river preventing a turning movement on the  north) he sent the second cavalry brigade galloping southward down the  line of the kopjes in order to turn, if possible, the enemy's left  flank. But he soon found that the position extended too far southward to  be assailable by his limited forces. This turning movement, or rather  the preparation for it, was carried out under an extremely heavy fire  from pom-poms and other quick-firing guns. Finding that his resources  would be exhausted in drawing out the long containing thread necessary  to hold the enemy in front, and so leave nothing with which to make a  flank attack, General French contented himself with engaging the enemy  on the northernmost end of their position.    At half-past one the Sixth Division arrived at Dreifontein, a"]]]
