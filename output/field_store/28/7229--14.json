One subspecies of the Carolina Wren, _berlandieri_, occurs in Coahuila  in the northeastern section of the State. Ridgway (1904:547) recorded  _T. l. berlandieri_ from Sabinas. The fact that No. 32086 was a  juvenile suggests that the Carolina Wren breeds 12 mi. N and 12 mi. W  Jimenez.    *_Campylorhynchus brunneicapillum couesi_ Sharpe.--_Specimens  examined:_ total 6: [Male] 29429 from Canyon del Cochino (=16 mi. N, 21  mi. E Piedra Blanca), 3200 ft., April 6, 1950; [Male] 31064 from 7 mi.  S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, 800 ft., February 29, 1952, weight, 38.1 gms.;  [Female] 31066 (skeleton only) from 10 mi. S, 5 mi. E Boquillas, 1500  ft., March 5, 1952; [Male] 31637 from La Gacha (=La Concha), December  1, 1953, weight, 40 gms.; [Male] 31638 from 18 mi. S Ocampo, December  16, 1953; and sex ? 29557 from 7 mi. S, 1 mi. E Gomez Farias, 6500 ft.,  November 18, 1949, weight, 41 gms.    This subspecies of the Cactus Wren occurs throughout Coahuila except in  the extreme southeastern section of the State, where the subspecies _C.  b. guttatus_ occurs. Miller (1955a:169) found _C. b. couesi_ breeding  and occupying the open swales and mesas at the base of the mountains of  the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:198) found _C.  brunneicapillum_ \"to be rather scarce and decidedly local in its  distribution\" and observed an occasional bird \"in the open desert  country west of Saltillo.\" Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:151) recorded _C. b. couesi_ \"south to [the] vicinity of  Monclova.\"    No. 29557 does not have any characters of _C. b. guttatus_; its under  tail coverts and flanks have roundish black spots, rather than black  bars as in _C. b. guttatus_.    **_Campylorhynchus brunneicapillum guttatus_ (Gould).--This subspecies  of Cactus Wren seems to occupy the extreme southeastern section of  Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:152) recorded _C.  b. guttatus_ from Hipolito.    _Telmatodytes palustris plesius_ (Oberholser).--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:148) reported this subspecies of the  Long-billed Marsh Wren from 8 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas.    *_Catherpes mexicanus albifrons_ (Giraud).--Miller (1955a:170) found  this subspecies of Canyon Wren \"in shaded rocky canyons and on larger  cliff slopes at the base of the mountains from 4700 to 5300 feet\" in  the Sierra del Carmen where it nested. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:198)  noted that the Canyon Wren was \"decidedly uncommon\" at Saltillo and  obtained a male at the Chorro de Agua on April 19. Ridgway (1904:657)  listed _C. m. albifrons_ from Patos.    *_Salpinctes obsoletus obsoletus_ (Say).--_Specimens examined:_ total  4: [Female] 31067 from 1 mi. N Boquillas, 700 ft., March 6, 1952,  weight, 16.1 gms.; [Female] 31068 from 7 mi. S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, 800  ft., March 1, 1952, weight, 18.2 gms.; sex ? 29558 from 12 mi. N, 10  mi. E Parras, 5000 ft., November 11, 1949, weight, 16.9 gms.; and  [Male] 32089 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union 7200 ft., June 24, 1952.    The Rock Wren is common in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:170) found _S. o.  obsoletus_ \"only in the rocky piedmont and on lower bare canyon faces\"  and stated that Marsh took a bird in fresh fall plumage on September 6  at El Jardin. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:37) found the Rock Wren \"near  San Pedro.\" Burleigh and Lowery (1942:198) wrote that the subspecies  _obsoletus_ was \"characteristically a bird of the arroyos of the arid  plateau about Saltillo, where it was fairly common....\" The large size  of the testes (5x3 mm.) of No. 32089 and the date (June 24) on which it  was obtained suggest breeding by the Rock Wren 7 mi. S and 4 mi. E  Bella Union.    *_Mimus polyglottos leucopterus_ (Vigors).--_Specimens examined:_ total  5: [Female] 31070 from 10 mi. S, 5 mi. E Boquillas, 1500 ft., March 5,  1952, weight, 55.1 gms.; [Male] [Male] 32094-32095 from 2 mi. W  Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952; [Male] 32096 from 5 mi. N, 19 mi. W  Cuatro Cienegas, 3250 ft., July 5, 1952; and [Male] 33186 (skeleton  only) from Parras, July 5, 1955, testes, 6x3 mm.    The Mockingbird is sparsely distributed throughout Coahuila. Miller  (1955a:170) found _M. p. leucopterus_ in the mesquite and catclaw at  the base of the mountains in the Sierra del Carmen. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:37) reported _M. p. leucopterus_ from Diamante Pass. Amadon and  Phillips (1947:578) found a young Mockingbird out of the nest begging  for food from an adult on August 18 at Las Delicias. Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:199) found the Mockingbird on the arid plateau \"about  Saltillo.\" Hellmayr (1934:308) listed _M. p. leucopterus_ from Jaral.  Findley saw Mockingbirds 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on  June 22, 1952. Dickerman saw Mockingbirds in the Sierra del Pino on May  12, 1954, and 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos on May 18, 1954. The sizes  of the testes (8, 7 mm.) of Nos. 32094 and 32096, respectively, suggest  breeding 2 mi. W Jimenez and 5 mi. N and 19 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas, as  does No. 32095, a juvenile.    *_Toxostoma longirostre sennetti_ (Ridgway).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 32090, from 2 mi. S, 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, June 22, 1952.    In Coahuila the Long-billed Thrasher seems to be uncommon. It has been  recorded in Coahuila as far west as San Juan de Sabinas. Ridgway  (1907:192) recorded _T. l. sennetti_ from Sabinas, the only other  record of the Long-billed Thrasher, to my knowledge, from the State.  The large size of the testes (11x6 mm.) of No. 32090 and the date (June  22) on which it was obtained suggest that _T. l. sennetti_ breeds 2 mi.  S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas.    *_Toxostoma curvirostre celsum_ Moore.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Female] 31071 from 7 mi. S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, March 1, 1952, wing,  111 mm., tail, 114 mm., weight, 97.2 gms.; and [Female] 31072 (skeleton  only) from 10 mi. S, 5 mi. E Boquillas, 1500 ft., March 5, 1952.    This subspecies of the Curve-billed Thrasher occurs in northwestern  Coahuila. Specimens of _T. c. celsum_ and _oberholseri_ from Coahuila  are too few to show clearly the distribution and intergradation in  Coahuila.    No. 31071 is referred to _T. c. celsum_ because of large size; the  spots on its upper abdomen, which are large and pronounced, suggest a  relationship with _T. c. oberholseri_. Miller (1955a:170) remarked that  _T. c. celsum_ was a scarce resident of the desert scrub at the mouth  of Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen.    *_Toxostoma curvirostre oberholseri_ Law.--_Specimens examined:_ total  5: [Female] 35405 (skeleton only) from 4 mi. N San Isidro, May 11,  1954; [Female] 32091 from 5 mi. N, 19 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas, 3250 ft.,  July 5, 1952; [Male] 32833 from Parras, July 4, 1955, weight, 76.5  gms.; [Female] 32092 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June  25, 1952; and [Male] 31614 from 16 mi. W San Antonio de las Alazanas,  6500 ft., January 7, 1954, weight, 90 gms.    This subspecies of the Curve-billed Thrasher occurs in eastern and  southern Coahuila. Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) took a Curve-billed  Thrasher twenty miles west of Saltillo that had an enlarged ovary and a  brood patch still somewhat evident on August 27. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:199) stated that _T. c. oberholseri_ \"was rather widely and  commonly distributed, being noted from the area about the summit of  Diamante Pass at 7,800 feet down to the desert country about Saltillo.\"  Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:177) recorded _T. c.  oberholseri_ from Sabinas, from 8 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas, and from El  Diamante. Hellmayr (1934:298) also recorded _T. c. oberholseri_ from  Sabinas, as did Ridgway (1907:199) under the name _T. c. curvirostre_  before the subspecies _oberholseri_ was named. The female from 4 mi. N  San Isidro had an egg in its oviduct. The immature male (32833), the  large size of ovum (8 mm.) of No. 32092, and the presence of a brood  patch on No. 32091 also are evidences of breeding by the Curve-billed  Thrasher in Coahuila.    *_Toxostoma dorsale dorsale_ Henry.--The Crissal Thrasher is uncommon  in Coahuila. The subspecies _dorsale_ occurs in northern Coahuila.  Miller (1955a:170-171) found the subspecies _dorsale_, at about 4700  feet, only in the mesquite, desert willow, and walnut scrub along the  wash of Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen and remarked also  that the bird nested there.    **_Toxostoma dorsale dumosum_ Moore.--_Specimen examined:_ one, sex ?  29559, from 8 mi. N La Ventura, 6000 ft., November 17, 1949, weight,  57.0 gms.    The subspecies _dumosum_ of the Crissal Thrasher in Coahuila has been  reported only from the southeastern section of the State. Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:199-200) found _T. d. dumosum_ \"not uncommon in the lower  foot-hills outside of Saltillo as well as on the summit of Diamante  Pass.\" The specimen of _T. d. dorsale_ from Diamante Pass reported by  Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:37) is closer, according to Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:199), to _T. d. dumosum_. No. 29559 is darker above and  below than typical specimens of _T. d. dorsale_ and represents _T. d.  dumosum_.    _Oreoscoptes montanus_ (Townsend).--_Specimen examined:_ one, sex ?  30237, from 1 mi. SW San Pedro de las Colonias, 3700 ft., February 8,  1951.    The Sage Thrasher seems to be a winter visitant to Coahuila. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:173) recorded the species in  November from 8 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas.    *_Turdus migratorius propinquus_ Ridgway.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31073 (skeleton only) from 4 mi. W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300  ft., March 24, 1952.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:200) stated that \"the Robin apparently breeds  rather sparingly on the higher ridges\" in southeastern Coahuila. They  collected a pair \"in the open pine woods just below the summit of  Diamante Pass\" on April 15 and noted another at the Chorro del Agua on  April 19.    **_Ridgwayia pinicola_ (Sclater).--_Specimen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26117"],[0,"Sketches of the Fair Sex, in All Parts of the World. (#14)"],[1,"    The descendants of the northern nations, long after they had plundered  and repeopled the greatest part of Europe, retained nearly the same  ideas of love, and practised the same methods in declaring it, that they  had imbibed from their ancestors. \"Love,\" says William of Montagnogout,  \"engages to the most amiable conduct. Love inspires the greatest  actions. Love has no will but that of the object beloved, nor seeks any  thing but what will augment her glory. You cannot love, nor ought to be  beloved, if you ask any thing that virtue condemns. Never did I form a  wish that could wound the heart of my beloved, nor delight in a pleasure  that was inconsistent with her delicacy.\"    The method of addressing females, among some of the tribes of American  Indians, is the most simple that can possibly be devised. When the  lover goes to visit his mistress, he only begs leave, by signs, to enter  her hut. After obtaining this, he goes in, and sits down by her in the  most respectful silence. If she suffers him to remain there without  interruption, her doing so is consenting to his suit. If, however, the  lover has any thing given him to eat and drink, it is a refusal; though  the woman is obliged to sit by him until he has finished his repast. He  then retires in silence.    In Canada, courtship is not carried on with that coy reserve, and  seeming secrecy, which politeness has introduced among the inhabitants of  civilized nations. When a man and a woman meet, though they never saw  each other before, if he is captivated by her charms, he declares his  passion in the plainest manner; and she, with the same simplicity,  answers, Yes, or No, without further deliberation. \"That female  reserve,\" says an ingenious writer, [Dr Alexander,] \"that seeming  reluctance to enter into the married state, observable in polite  countries, is the work of art, and not of nature. The history of every  uncultivated people amply proves it. It tells us, that their women not  only speak with freedom the sentiments of their hearts, but even blush  not to have these sentiments made as public as possible.\"    In Formosa, however, they differ so much from the simplicity of the  Canadians, that it would be reckoned the greatest indecency in the man  to declare, or in the woman to hear, a declaration of the passion of  love. The lover is, therefore, obliged to depute his mother, sister, or  some female relation; and from any of these the soft tale may be heard  without the least offence to delicacy.    In Spain, the women had formerly no voice in disposing of themselves in  matrimony. But as the empire of common sense began to extend itself,  they began to claim a privilege, at least of being consulted in the  choice of the partners of their lives. Many fathers and guardians, hurt  by this female innovation, and puffed up with Spanish pride, still  insisted on forcing their daughters to marry according to their  pleasure, by means of duennas, locks, hunger, and even sometimes of  poison and daggers. But as nature will revolt against every species of  oppression and injustice, the ladies have for some time begun to assert  their own rights. The authority of fathers and guardians begins to  decline, and lovers find themselves obliged to apply to the affections  of the fair, as well as to the pride and avarice of their relations.    The nightly musical serenades of mistresses by their lovers are still in  use. The gallant composes some love sonnets, as expressive as he can,  not only of the situation of his heart, but of every particular  circumstance between him and the lady, not forgetting to lard them with  the most extravagant encomiums on her beauty and merit. These he sings  in the night below her window accompanied with his lute, or sometimes  with a whole band of music. The more piercingly cold the air, the more  the lady's heart is supposed to be thawed with the patient sufferance  of her lover, who, from night to night, frequently continues his  exercises for many hours, heaving the deepest sighs, and casting the  most piteous looks towards the window; at which if his goddess at last  deigns to appear, and drops him a curtsey, he is superlatively paid for  all his watching; but if she blesses him with a smile, he is ready to  run distracted.    In Italy the manner of addressing the ladies, so far as it relates to  serenading, nearly resembles that of Spain. The Italian, however, goes a  step farther than the Spaniard. He endeavors to blockade the house where  his fair one lives, so as to prevent the entrance of any rival. If he  marries the lady who cost him all this trouble and attendance, he shuts  her up for life: If not, she becomes the object of his eternal hatred,  and he too frequently endeavors to revenge by poison the success of his  happier rival.    In one circumstance relating to courtship, the Italians are said to be  particular. They protract the time as long as possible, well knowing  that even with all the little ills attending it, a period thus employed  is one of the sweetest of human life.    A French lover, with the word sentiment perpetually in his mouth, seems  by every action to have excluded it from his heart. He places his whole  confidence in his exterior air and appearance. He dresses for his  mistress, dances for her, flutters constantly about her, helps her to  lay on her rouge, and to place her patches. He attends her round the  whole circle of amusements, chatters to her constantly, whistles and  sings, and plays the fool with her. Whatever be his station, every thing  gaudy and glittering within the sphere of it is called in to his  assistance, particularly splendid carriages and tawdry liveries; but if,  by the help of all these, he cannot make an impression on the fair one's  heart, it costs him nothing but a few shrugs of his shoulders, two or  three silly exclamations, and as many stanzas of some satirical song  against her; and, as it is impossible for a Frenchman to live without an  amour, he immediately betakes himself to another.    There is hardly any such thing among people of fashion as courtship.  Matters are generally so ordered by parents and guardians, that to a  bride and bridegroom, the day of marriage is often the second time of  their meeting. In many countries, to be married in this manner would be  reckoned the greatest of misfortunes. In France it is little regarded.  In the fashionable world, few people are greater strangers to, or more  indifferent about each other, than husband and wife; and any appearance  of fondness between them, or their being seen frequently together, would  infallibly make them forfeit the reputation of the _ton_, and be laughed  at by all polite company. On this account, nothing is more common than  to be acquainted with a lady without knowing her husband, or visiting  the husband without ever seeing his wife.      GERMAN WOMEN.    Of all the German females, the ladies of Saxony are the most amiable.  Their persons are so superiorly charming and preferable in whatever can  recommend them to be notice of mankind, that the German youth often  visit Saxony in quest of _companions_ for life. Exclusive of their  beauty and comeliness of appearance, they are brought up in a knowledge  of all those arts, both useful and ornamental, which are so brilliant an  addition to their native attractions. But what chiefly enhances their  value, and gives it reality and duration, is a _sweetness_ of temper and  festivity of disposition, that never fail to endear them on a very  slight acquaintance. To crown all, they are generally patterns of  conjugal tenderness and fidelity.    As they are commonly careful to improve their minds by reading and  instructive conversation, they have no small share of facetiousness and  ingenuity. From their innate liveliness, they are extremely addicted to  all the gay kind of amusements. They excel in the allurements of dress  and decoration, and are in general skilful in music.    The character, however, of the women in most other parts of Germany,  particularly of the Austrian, is very different from this.  Notwithstanding the advantages of size and make, their looks and  features, though not unsightly, betray a vacancy of that life and  spirit, without which beauty is uninteresting, and, like a mere picture,  becomes utterly void of that indication of sensibility, which alone can  awaken a delicacy of feeling.    As their education is conducted by the rules of the grossest  superstition, and they are taught little else than set forms of  devotion, they arrive to the years of maturity uninstructed in the use  of reason, and usually continue profoundly ignorant the remainder of  their days, which are spent, or rather loitered away, in apathy and  indolence.    The principal happiness of the Austrian ladies of fashion consists in  ruminating on the dignity of their birth and families, the antiquity of  their race, the rank they hold, the respect attached to it, and the  prerogatives they enjoy over the inferior classes, whom they treat with  the utmost superciliousness, and hold in the most unreasonable contempt.  In the mean time, their domestic affairs are condemned to the most  unaccountable neglect. They dwell at home, careless of what passes  there; and suffer disorder and confusion to prevail, without feeling the  least uneasiness. Great frequenters of churches, their piety consists in  the strictest conformity to all the externals of religion. They profess  the most boundless belief in all the silly legends with which their  treatises of devotion are filled; and these are the only books they ever  read. The coldness of their constitution occasions a species of  regulated gallantry, which is rather the effect of an opinion that it  is an appendage of high life, than the result of their natural  inclination.    It must, at the same time be allowed, that the Austrian women are  endowed with a great fund of sincerity and candor;"]]]
