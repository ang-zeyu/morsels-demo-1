SEWING ON BANDS    [Sidenote: Gathering]    Divide the top of unhemmed edge of the garment in halves and mark with a  cross stitch, notch or pin. Gather from the placket to the middle of the  front gore, if a skirt, apron, or dress. Take a new thread and gather  the remainder. Put in a second gathering thread one-eighth to one-fourth  of an inch below the first. Two gathering threads are better than one  and they should be longer than the length of space to be gathered.  Stroke or lay the gathers above and below the threads. Divide the band  and pin the middle to the center of the garment, placing the right side  of the band on the wrong side of the garment. Pin in the middle and at  each end, secure the gathering threads by winding around the pin, adjust  the gathers, and baste between the gathering threads. Stitch just below  the line of basting. Fold the band over on the right side, press, baste  over the line of stitching, press again, then stitch on the right side  after having turned in both ends and over-sewed. Turn the _top_ of the  band over on the right side one-eighth or one-fourth of an inch and  stitch securely. This upper fold keeps the edge from wearing and  stretching and is a stay for children's skirts and drawers where button  holes are used and serves as a finish for the top of the band.      [Illustration: FINISHES    _a_--Bias Facing; _b_--Band on Gathers; _c_--Corded edge.]      For flannel, pleating or gathers may be used to put fullness into a  band. Two rows of gathering threads should be used and the stitches  should not be too fine. The band should be made of cotton or at least  lined with it to avoid clumsiness and prevent shrinking. Ruffles are set  in hems, etc., in the same manner.      [Illustration: DRAW TAPE FINISH FOR UNDER SKIRT]      [Sidenote: Drawing Tapes]    In finishing the top of an underskirt, many like to dispense with the  placket and fitted band. This may be done by using drawing tapes at the  back. The upper edge is faced with a piece of material which should be  bias in front to accommodate it to the curve, but may be straight across  the back. Work a button hole at each side of the back, insert a tape  through one button hole and draw it over an inch beyond the opposite one  and fasten securely by two lines of stitching across the tape. A second  tape is put through the other button hole and fastened in the same way.  By pulling the tape on each side the fullness may be adjusted.    [Sidenote: Bias Facings]    All facings around curves, such as arm holes and neck, should be a true  bias which is cut by holding the warp threads diagonally across the woof  threads. These strips for facings, pipings, ruffles, etc., should be cut  exactly even in width. All bands, ruffles, etc., of serge, twilled, or  diagonal materials should be cut _across_ the twill and not with it, in  order to have the ruffle hang well.      FASTENINGS    The standard fastenings are buttons and button holes, hooks and eyes or  hand made loops, lacings through rings and eyelet holes, loops over  buttons, and fancy frogs, clasps, studs, ball and socket, \"notta-hooks,\"  etc.    [Sidenote: Making Button Holes]    Button holes should be carefully measured and marked before cutting.  They should be a little longer than the diameter of the button for flat  buttons and one and one-quarter the diameter for round buttons. Having  decided upon the distance apart they are to be placed, cut a marker from  a piece of cardboard and measure off the space, marking with pins,  French chalk, pencil, or thread. The distance from the edge (one-fourth  inch), as well as the length of the button hole may also be marked with  the card. The scissors should be sharp, the hand must be steady, and the  cut should be made with one firm slash, not with two or three jerks.  Great care must be taken that each button hole is of the same length.  The goods should be cut to a thread, for it is impossible to make a neat  buttonhole if it is improperly cut. In cutting a round end buttonhole  for thick goods, a punch may be used for the end, after which the  remainder of the buttonhole is cut directly on a line with the center of  the circle.    The same marker may be used to mark the position for the buttons. All  markings for buttons and buttonholes, or for hooks and eyes, should be  made at one time.    [Sidenote: Overcasting Buttonholes]    After cutting, the button holes are overcast. This should always be done  directly after cutting, especially if the goods ravels easily, otherwise  it will be impossible to work a neat buttonhole. Overcasting should be  done with very fine thread (No. 150 for white goods), split silk for  wool and silk. Three overcast stitches on each side are sufficient for  an ordinary size buttonhole.    A very good plan to follow in cutting a buttonhole in heavy material or  material that frays easily is to chalk the position and length of the  buttonhole, then stitch a row of machine stitching each side of this  mark, the two rows being a little more than one-eighth of an inch apart.  This holds all the thicknesses together and the buttonhole may then be  cut easily. It also serves as a guide in working the buttonhole  stitches.      [Illustration: BUTTONS, BUTTON HOLES, EYELETS, LOOPS]      The buttonholing is begun at the inner side of the slit. Always place  the knot on the outside of the garment a short distance to the right of  the buttonhole, leaving a long stitch underneath which can be cut off  when the buttonhole is finished. A buttonhole should be completed with  one thread if possible as it is difficult to mend the thread securely  and neatly. Letter D for twist is usually employed.    [Sidenote: Making Buttonholes]    Insert the needle in the edge of the material and when half way through,  take the two threads at the eye of the needle, bringing them towards you  at the right and under the point of the needle, and draw the thread from  you, making the purl or loop stitch directly on the edge of the  buttonhole. The stitches should be about the width of the needle apart  to allow for the purl. Be careful to complete each stitch with a uniform  movement so that the line will be perfectly straight and not wavy. The  stitches are placed more closely together in the rounded end of the  buttonhole where the chief wear comes.    [Sidenote: Staying]    Many workers, particularly tailors, always \"stay\" or \"bar\" around a  buttonhole before working. This may be done with several threads of  twist or with a cord so that the worked edge of the buttonhole will be  firm and distinct. Tailors usually use a cord as this makes the edges  heavier. It is always well to stay buttonholes in heavy material as it  strengthens them very much and improves their appearance.    [Sidenote: Bar Tack]    When the buttonhole has been worked all around, the end is completed  with a bar tack made by taking two or three stitches across the end of  the buttonhole, drawing the edges closer together. This bar is covered  with buttonhole stitches worked close together. The thread is fastened  securely on the wrong side.    [Sidenote: Large Buttonholes]    After very large buttonholes are finished, their straight edges should  be closely basted together by an over and over stitch and then pressed  under a damp cloth. Before they are dry, a bodkin or stiletto should be  pushed vigorously up through each eyelet until that opening becomes  perfectly round and the stitches on its edges are regular and distinct.  When the basting is removed, the buttonhole will be symmetrical in  appearance.    Buttonholes which are to bear a strain are cut in the direction of the  pull, but sometimes they are cut in the opposite direction, as for a  shirt waist. Such a buttonhole may be completed with a bar tack on each  end.    [Sidenote: Sewing on Buttons]    Ordinary buttons should never be sewed down tightly, but the thread  should be loose so that it may be wound around at the end, thus  protecting the holding threads from wear. The shank prevents the  buttonhole from being crowded out of shape. Loose sewing can most easily  be done by placing a pin or needle across the top of the button and  sewing over it. If a button is much concaved, the pin may be placed  underneath. The pin is removed before winding.    In sewing on a four-hole button, the stitches should be made  symmetrically, either parallel or crossed, but not both. If parallel or  in a two-holed button the stitches should run in the line of the  buttonhole. The thread should always be fastened at the beginning and at  the end of the work. Place the knot upon the outside of the garment  where it may be cut off when the button is sewed securely. The knot is  sometimes placed under the button.    [Sidenote: Cloak Buttons]    In sewing buttons on a cloak or coat an extra strip of canvas or silesia  over the canvas interlining should be placed the entire length of the  buttoning for strength. This should be applied before the work on the  garment is too far advanced and if cut sufficiently wide, will allow any  slight alteration. The sewing should go through the canvas facing and  stay, but not through the under side or facing of the material.    In sewing buttons on bodices a tape should be sewed over the front  basting for a stay. If sufficient material has not been allowed for a  lap, this should be added, as a lap is necessary under the opening of  such buttonholes.    Buttons may be sewed through lining having a small button on the wrong  side. This method prevents the cloth from tearing and makes an  ornamental finish as well as a substantial one.    Buttons which are supplied with wire shanks should be sewed down firmly  as the shank already provided permits the buttons to set up well from  the material. They should be placed in such a position that the wire  shank will run parallel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2160"],[0,"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (#14)"],[1,"expressions of mutual good-will, and as we had met so unexpectedly, we  agreed to dine together that very day at the tavern. My friend Quin,  being luckily unengaged, obliged us with his company; and, truly, this  the most happy day I have passed these twenty years. You and I, Lewis,  having been always together, never tasted friendship in this high gout,  contracted from long absence. I cannot express the half of what I felt  at this casual meeting of three or four companions, who had been so  long separated, and so roughly treated by the storms of life. It was a  renovation of youth; a kind of resuscitation of the dead, that realized  those interesting dreams, in which we sometimes retrieve our ancient  friends from the grave. Perhaps my enjoyment was not the less pleasing  for being mixed with a strain of melancholy, produced by the remembrance  of past scenes, that conjured up the ideas of some endearing connexions,  which the hand of Death has actually dissolved.    The spirits and good humour of the company seemed to triumph over the  wreck of their constitutions. They had even philosophy enough to  joke upon their own calamities; such is the power of friendship, the  sovereign cordial of life--I afterwards found, however, that they were  not without their moments, and even hours of disquiet. Each of them  apart, in succeeding conferences, expatiated upon his own particular  grievances; and they were all malcontents at bottom--Over and above  their personal disasters, they thought themselves unfortunate in the  lottery of life. Balderick complained, that all the recompence he  had received for his long and hard service, was the half-pay of a  rear-admiral. The colonel was mortified to see himself over-topped by  upstart generals, some of whom he had once commanded; and, being a man  of a liberal turn, could ill put up with a moderate annuity, for which  he had sold his commission. As for the baronet, having run himself  considerably in debt, on a contested election, he has been obliged to  relinquish his seat in parliament, and his seat in the country at the  same time, and put his estate to nurse; but his chagrin, which is the  effect of his own misconduct, does not affect me half so much as that of  the other two, who have acted honourable and distinguished parts on the  great theatre, and are now reduced to lead a weary life in this stew-pan  of idleness and insignificance. They have long left off using the  waters, after having experienced their inefficacy. The diversions of the  place they are not in a condition to enjoy. How then do they make shift  to pass their time? In the forenoon they crawl out to the Rooms or  the coffeehouse, where they take a hand at whist, or descant upon the  General Advertiser; and their evenings they murder in private parties,  among peevish invalids, and insipid old women--This is the case with  a good number of individuals, whom nature seems to have intended for  better purposes.    About a dozen years ago, many decent families, restricted to small  fortunes, besides those that came hither on the score of health, were  tempted to settle at Bath, where they could then live comfortably, and  even make a genteel appearance, at a small expence: but the madness of  the times has made the place too hot for them, and they are now obliged  to think of other migrations--Some have already fled to the mountains  of Wales, and others have retired to Exeter. Thither, no doubt, they  will be followed by the flood of luxury and extravagance, which will  drive them from place to place to the very Land's End; and there, I  suppose, they will be obliged to ship themselves to some other country.  Bath is become a mere sink of profligacy and extortion. Every article of  house-keeping is raised to an enormous price; a circumstance no longer  to be wondered at, when we know that every petty retainer of fortune  piques himself upon keeping a table, and thinks it is for the honour  of his character to wink at the knavery of his servants, who are in a  confederacy with the market-people; and, of consequence, pay whatever  they demand. Here is now a mushroom of opulence, who pays a cook seventy  guineas a week for furnishing him with one meal a day. This portentous  frenzy is become so contagious, that the very rabble and refuse of  mankind are infected. I have known a negro-driver, from Jamaica, pay  over-night, to the master of one of the rooms, sixty-five guineas for  tea and coffee to the company, and leave Bath next morning, in such  obscurity, that not one of his guests had the slightest idea of his  person, or even made the least inquiry about his name. Incidents of this  kind are frequent; and every day teems with fresh absurdities, which are  too gross to make a thinking man merry.    --But I feel the spleen creeping on me apace; and therefore will indulge  you with a cessation, that you may have no unnecessary cause to curse  your correspondence with,    Dear Dick, Yours ever, MAT. BRAMBLE BATH, May 5.          To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.    MY DEAR LETTY,    I wrote you at great length by the post, the twenty-sixth of last month,  to which I refer you for an account of our proceedings at Bath; and I  expect your answer with impatience. But, having this opportunity of a  private hand, I send you two dozen of Bath rings; six of the best of  which I desire you will keep for yourself, and distribute the rest among  the young ladies, our common friends, as you shall think proper--I don't  know how you will approve of the mottoes; some of them are not much  to my own liking; but I was obliged to take such as I could find ready  manufactured--I am vexed, that neither you nor I have received any  further information of a certain person--Sure it cannot be wilful  neglect!--O my dear Willis! I begin to be visited by strange fancies,  and to have some melancholy doubts; which, however, it would be  ungenerous to harbour without further inquiry--My uncle, who has made  me a present of a very fine set of garnets, talks of treating us with a  jaunt to London; which, you may imagine, will be highly agreeable; but  I like Bath so well, that I hope he won't think of leaving it till the  season is quite over; and yet, betwixt friends, something has happened  to my aunt, which will probably shorten our stay in this place.    Yesterday, in the forenoon, she went by herself to a breakfasting in one  of the rooms; and, in half an hour, returned in great agitation, having  Chowder along with her in the chair. I believe some accident must have  happened to that unlucky animal, which is the great source of all her  troubles. Dear Letty! what a pity it is, that a woman of her years  and discretion, should place her affection upon such an ugly,  ill-conditioned cur, that snarls and snaps at every body. I asked John  Thomas, the footman who attended her, what was the matter? and he did  nothing but grin. A famous dog-doctor was sent for, and undertook to  cure the patient, provided he might carry him home to his own house; but  his mistress would not part with him out of her own sight--She ordered  the cook to warm cloths, which she applied to his bowels, with her own  hand. She gave up all thoughts of going to the ball in the evening; and  when Sir Ulic came to drink tea, refused to be seen; so that he went  away to look for another partner. My brother Jery whistles and dances.  My uncle sometimes shrugs up his shoulders, and sometimes bursts out  a-laughing. My aunt sobs and scolds by turns; and her woman, Win.  Jenkins, stares and wonders with a foolish face of curiosity; and, for  my part, I am as curious as she, but ashamed to ask questions.    Perhaps time will discover the mystery; for if it was any thing that  happened in the Rooms, it cannot be long concealed--All I know is, that  last night at supper, miss Bramble spoke very disdainfully of Sir Ulic  Mackilligut, and asked her brother if he intended to keep us sweltering  all the summer at Bath? 'No, sister Tabitha (said he, with an arch  smile) we shall retreat before the Dog-days begin; though I make no  doubt, that with a little temperance and discretion, our constitutions  might be kept cool enough all the year, even at Bath.' As I don't know  the meaning of this insinuation, I won't pretend to make any remarks  upon it at present: hereafter, perhaps, I may be able to explain it more  to your satisfaction--In the mean time, I beg you will be punctual in  your correspondence, and continue to love your ever faithful    LYDIA MELFORD BATH, May 6.          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    So then Mrs Blackerby's affair has proved a false alarm, and I have  saved my money? I wish, however, her declaration had not been so  premature; for though my being thought capable of making her a mother,  might have given me some credit, the reputation of an intrigue with such  a cracked pitcher does me no honour at all In my last I told you I had  hopes of seeing Quin, in his hours of elevation at the tavern which is  the temple of mirth and good fellowship; where he, as priest of Comus,  utters the inspirations of wit and humour--I have had that satisfaction.  I have dined with his club at the Three Tuns, and had the honour to sit  him out. At half an hour past eight in the evening, he was carried  home with six good bottles of claret under his belt; and it being then  Friday, he gave orders that he should not be disturbed till Sunday at  noon--You must not imagine that this dose had any other effect upon his  conversation, but that of making it more extravagantly entertaining--He  had lost the use of his limbs, indeed, several hours before we parted,  but he retained all his other faculties in perfection; and as he gave  vent to every whimsical idea as it rose, I was really astonished at the  brilliancy of his thoughts, and the force of his expression.
