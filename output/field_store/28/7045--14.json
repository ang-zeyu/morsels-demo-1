Yet in face  of the great danger which still threatened them all these things  appeared endurable....    When daylight broke and the Syracusans and their allies saw that the  Athenians had departed, most of them thought that Gylippus had let  them go on purpose, and were very angry with him. They easily found  the line of their retreat, and quickly following came up with them  about the time of the midday meal. The troops of Demosthenes were  last; they were marching slowly and in disorder, not having recovered  from the panic of the previous night, when they were overtaken by the  Syracusans, who immediately fell upon them and fought. Separated as  they were from the others, they were easily hemmed in by the Syracusan  cavalry and driven into a narrow space. The division of Nicias was as  much as six miles in advance, for he marched faster, thinking that  their safety depended at such a time, not in remaining and fighting,  if they could avoid it, but in retreating as quickly as they could,  and resisting only when they were positively compelled.    Demosthenes, on the other hand, who had been more incessantly harassed  throughout the retreat, because marching last, was first attacked by  the enemy; now, when he saw the Syracusans pursuing him, instead of  pressing onward, had ranged his army in order of battle. Thus  lingering he was surrounded, and he and the Athenians under his  command were in the greatest danger and confusion. For they were  crusht into a walled enclosure, having a road on both sides and  planted thickly with olive-trees, and missiles were hurled at them  from all points. The Syracusans naturally preferred this mode of  attack to a regular engagement. For to risk themselves against  desperate men would have been only playing into the hands of the  Athenians. Moreover, every one was sparing of his life; their good  fortune was already assured, and they did not wish to fall in the hour  of victory. Even by this irregular mode of fighting they thought that  they could overpower and capture the Athenians.    And so when they had gone on all day assailing them with missiles from  every quarter, and saw that they were quite worn out with their wounds  and all their other sufferings, Gylippus and the Syracusans made a  proclamation, first of all to the islanders, that any of them who  pleased might come over to them and have their freedom. But only a few  cities accepted the offer. At length an agreement was made for the  entire force under Demosthenes. Their arms were to be surrendered but  no one was to suffer death, either from violence or from imprisonment,  or from want of the bare means of life. So they all surrendered, being  in number six thousand, and gave up what money they had. This they  threw into the hollows of shields and filled four. The captives were  at once taken to the city. On the same day Nicias and his division  reached the river Erineus, which he crossed, and halted his army on a  rising ground.    On the following day, he was overtaken by the Syracusans, who told him  that Demosthenes had surrendered, and bade him do the same. He, not  believing them, procured a truce while he sent a horseman to go and  see. Upon the return of the horseman bringing assurance of the fact,  he sent a herald to Gylippus and the Syracusans, saying that he would  agree, on behalf of the Athenian state, to pay the expenses which the  Syracusans had incurred in the war, on condition that they should let  his army go; until the money was paid he would give Athenian citizens  as hostages, a man for a talent. Gylippus and the Syracusans would not  accept these proposals, but attacked and surrounded this division of  the army as well as the other, and hurled missiles at them from every  side until the evening. They too were grievously in want of food and  necessaries. Nevertheless they meant to wait for the dead of the night  and then to proceed. They were just resuming their arms, when the  Syracusans discovered them and raised the paean. The Athenians,  perceiving that they were detected, laid down their arms again, with  the exception of about three hundred men who broke through the enemy's  guard, and made their escape in the darkness as best they could.    When the day dawned Nicias led forward his army, and the Syracusans  and the allies again assailed them on every side, hurling javelins and  other missiles at them. The Athenians hurried on to the river  Assinarus. They hoped to gain a little relief if they forded the  river, for the mass of horsemen and other troops overwhelmed and  crusht them; and they were worn out by fatigue and thirst. But no  sooner did they reach the water than they lost all order and rushed  in; every man was trying to cross first, and, the enemy pressing upon  them at the same time, the passage of the river became hopeless. Being  compelled to keep close together they fell one upon another, and  trampled each other under foot; some at once perished, pierced by  their own spears; others got entangled in the baggage and were carried  down the stream. The Syracusans stood upon the further bank of the  river, which was steep, and hurled missiles from above on the  Athenians, who were huddled together in the deep bed of the stream and  for the most part were drinking greedily. The Peloponnesians came down  the bank and slaughtered them, falling chiefly upon those who were in  the river. Whereupon the water at once became foul but was drunk all  the same, altho muddy and dyed with blood, and the crowd fought for  it.    At last, when the dead bodies were lying in heaps upon one another in  the water and the army was utterly undone, some perishing in the  river, and any one who escaped being cut off by the cavalry, Nicias  surrendered to Gylippus, in whom he had more confidence than in the  Syracusans. He entreated him and the Lacedaemonians to do what they  pleased with himself, but not to go on killing the men. So Gylippus  gave the word to make prisoners. Thereupon the survivors, not  including, however, a large number whom the soldiers concealed, were  brought in alive. As for the three hundred who had broken through the  guard in the night, the Syracusans sent in pursuit and seized them.  The total of the public prisoners when collected was not great; for  many were appropriated by the soldiers, and the whole of Sicily was  full of them, they not having capitulated like the troops under  Demosthenes. A large number also perished; the slaughter at the river  being very great, quite as great as any which took place in the  Sicilian war; and not a few had fallen in the frequent attacks which  were made upon the Athenians during the march. Still many escaped,  some at the time, others ran away after an interval of slavery, and  all these found refuge at Catana.    The Syracusans and their allies collected their forces and returned  with the spoil, and as many prisoners as they could take with them,  into the city. The captive Athenians and allies they deposited in the  quarries, which they thought would be the safest place of confinement.  Nicias and Demosthenes they put to the sword, altho against the will  of Gylippus. For Gylippus thought that to carry home with him to  Lacedaemon the generals of the enemy, over and above all his other  successes, would be a brilliant triumph. One of them, Demosthenes,  happened to be the greatest foe, and the other the greatest friend of  the Lacedaemonians, both in the same matter of Pylos and Sphacteria....    Those who were imprisoned in the quarries were at the beginning of  their captivity harshly treated by the Syracusans. There were great  numbers of them, and they were crowded in a deep and narrow place. At  first the sun by day was scorching and suffocating, for they had no  roof over their heads, while the autumn nights were cold, and the  extremes of temperature engendered violent disorders. Being cramped  for room, they had to do everything on the same spot. The corpses of  those who had died from their wounds, exposure to the weather, and the  like lay heaped one upon another. The smells were intolerable; and the  prisoners were at the same time afflicted by hunger and thirst. During  eight months they were allowed only about half a pint of water and a  pint of food a day.[44] Every kind of misery which could befall man in  such a place befell them. This was the condition of all the captives  for about ten weeks. At length the Syracusans sold them, with the  exception of the Athenians and of any Sicilian or Italian Greeks who  had sided with them in the war. The whole number of the public  prisoners is not accurately known, but they were not less than seven  thousand.    Of all the Hellenic actions which took place in this war, or indeed of  all Hellenic actions which are on record, this was the greatest--the  most glorious to the victors, the most ruinous to the vanquished; for  they were utterly and at all points defeated, and their sufferings  were prodigious. Fleet and army perished from the face of the earth;  nothing was saved, and of the many who went forth few returned home.    Thus ended the Sicilian expedition.

Mass was said with great solemnity by the priest of the expedition, Fra  Vincente de Valverde, an iron-souled, fierce-hearted Dominican, meet  ecclesiastic for such a band.  Refreshments were then provided  liberally for the soldiers--it is not so stated, but it may be presumed  that some of them were in liquid shape--and then the whole party  settled down to await developments.  Nothing seemed to be going on in  the Peruvian camp during the morning.  The Inca moved toward the city  in the afternoon, but stopped just outside the walls, to the great  annoyance of the Spaniards, who had found the long wait a trying  experience indeed.  Late in the afternoon, Pizarro received a message  that Atahualpa had changed his mind and would not visit him until the  following day.  This did not suit his plans at all.  He instantly  returned an answer to the Inca, begging him not to defer his visit,  saying that he had provided everything for his entertainment--which was  quite true although in a very different sense from that conveyed by the  words of his messenger--and requesting Atahualpa to arrange to sup with  him without fail that night.  Pizarro had previously assured the Inca  that he would receive him as a \"friend and brother\"!  What reasons  actuated the Inca we have no means of ascertaining.  Suffice it to say  that he changed his mind and came.    {81}    A short time after sunset, therefore, the Inca, attended by a numerous  retinue, entered the square.  Atahualpa was borne aloft on a throne  made of massive gold, supported on the shoulders of his attendants.  He  was dressed with barbaric magnificence in robes of exquisite texture,  heavily embroidered and ornamented with gold and silver.  Around his  neck blazed a necklace of emeralds of wonderful size and great  brilliancy.  His forehead was hidden by a thick vivid scarlet fringe  depending from a diadem almost to the eyebrows.  This tassel (or  _borla_, as the Spaniards called it; _llauta_, according to the  Peruvians) was the supreme mark of the imperial dignity in that no one  but the Inca could wear it.  The Inca was surrounded by a gorgeously  attired body of retainers who were preceded by hundreds of menials who  cleared the streets of every obstacle which might impede the progress  of their master, the Son of the Sun.  The processions divided at the  square, and the monarch was carried forward in the open.  Not a  Spaniard save the watchful sentries pacing the fort above, was to be  seen.    \"Where,\" asked Atahualpa, looking about in surprise, \"are the  strangers?\"    At this moment, at the request of Pizarro, Father Valverde came forward  in his canonicals, crucifix in one hand, breviary or Bible in the  other.[7]  He was attended by one of the Peruvians whom Pizarro had  taken back to Spain, who was to act as interpreter.  This precocious  little rascal, named Felippo, was the best interpreter that could be  found, which is saying little, for his Spanish was bad and mainly  picked up in the camps from the rude soldiery, and his Peruvian {82}  was only an uncouth dialect of the highly inflected and most flexible  and expressive Quichua, the language of the educated, indeed of the  most of the people.  Approaching the litter of the Inca, Valverde  delivered an extraordinary address.  He briefly explained the doctrines  of the Christian religion to the astonished Peruvian, requiring him to  conform to this religion and acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the  Pope, and at the same time to submit to the sway of his Imperial  Majesty Charles V.  It was a pretty heavy demand to spring upon a great  monarch in the midst of his people, and it was not to be wondered at  that Atahualpa rejected these requests with contempt.    The Inca answered the friar not without shrewdness.  He had gathered  the idea from Felippo's vile mistranslation that the Christians  worshipped four Gods, i. e. the Trinity and the Pope.  He declared that  he himself worshipped one, and there was its sign and symbol--pointing  to the declining sun; that he believed one God was better than four.  He rejected indignantly the idea that he, \"The Lord of the Four  Quarters of the Earth,\" owed allegiance to any Charles V. or any other  earthly monarch, of whom he had never heard and who had assuredly never  heard of him either.    Valverde had referred to the book in his hand as he had spoken and  Atahualpa now asked to see it.  The volume was a clasped one and he  found it difficult to open.  Valverde, probably thinking he could show  him to unclasp the volume, stepped nearer to him.  The Inca repulsed  him with disdain.  Wrenching open the covers he glanced rapidly at the  book, and perhaps suddenly realizing the full sense of the insult which  had been offered to him in the demands {83} of the dogmatic and  domineering Dominican, he threw the sacred volume to the ground in a  violent rage.    \"Tell your companions,\" he said, \"that they shall give me an account of  their doings in my land.  I will not go hence until they have made me  full satisfaction for all the wrongs they have committed!\"    Then he turned and spoke to his people--the last word he was ever to  address them as a free monarch from his throne.  There was a loud  murmur from the crowd.    Thereupon, according to some accounts, Valverde picked up the book  through which Atahualpa had offered such a deadly insult to his  religion and rushed back to Pizarro, exclaiming, \"Do you not see that  while we stand here wasting our breath in talking with this dog, full  of pride as he is, the fields are filling with Indians?  Set on at  once!  I absolve you for whatever you do!\"  I would fain do no man an  injustice.  Therefore, I also set down what other authorities say,  namely, that Valverde simply told Pizarro what had occurred.    There is no dispute, however, as to what happened immediately.  Pizarro  stepped out from the doorway, and drawing a white scarf from his  shoulders, threw it into the air.  Instantly a shot roared from the  fort above his head.  The famous war-cry of the Spaniards, \"St. Jago,  and at them!\" rang over every quarter of the square into which, with  bared swords, couched lances and drawn bows, poured the mail-clad  soldiery horse and foot.    They burst upon the astonished ranks of the unarmed Indians with the  suddenness and swiftness of a tornado.  From the roof above, the  gunners discharged their bullets into the swaying, seething mass.  With  {84} their wands of office, with their naked hands, with whatever they  could seize, the Peruvians defended themselves.  They rallied around  the person of the Inca, freely offering their breasts to the Spanish  blades with the vain attempt to protect their monarch.    Atahualpa sat upon his reeling throne gazing upon the bloody scene in a  daze of surprise.  Pizarro and the twenty chosen cut their way to the  litter and, striking down the helpless bearers thereof, precipitated  the Inca to the ground.  The Spaniards were mad with carnage now, and  were striking indiscriminately at any Indian.  Then could be heard  Pizarro's stern voice ringing above the melee, \"Let no man who values  his life strike at the Inca!\"  Such was the fierceness of his soldiery,  however, that in his frenzied attempt to protect the monarch, Pizarro  was wounded in one of his hands by his own men.  As the Inca fell, he  had been caught by Pizarro and supported, although a soldier named  Estete snatched the imperial _llauta_ from his head as he fell.    With the capture of the Inca, what little futile resistance the unarmed  host had been able to make ceased.  The Indians, relentlessly pursued  by their bloody conquerors, fled in every direction, and, to anticipate  events, the army deprived of its monarch and its generals, dispersed  the next day without striking a blow.  Indeed the army was helpless for  offence while the Spaniards held the Inca as a hostage.    The estimates of the numbers slain in one half-hour's fighting in the  square of Caxamarca vary from two to ten thousand.  Whatever the  number, it was great and horrible enough.  An unparalleled act of  treachery had been consummated, and Peru, in the space of thirty  minutes had been conquered and Pizarro held {85} it in the hollow of  his hand.  Not a Spaniard had been wounded except Pizarro himself, and  his wound had been received from his own men while he tried to protect  Atahualpa from the Spaniards' fury.      V. The Ransom and Murder of the Inca    Pizarro treated the Inca well enough, although he held him in rigorous  captivity.  Nobody else in Peru seemed to know what to do under the  circumstances, and the Spaniards soon lost all apprehension of  resistance.  Quiz-Quiz and Chalcuchima still held Huascar a captive at  Xuaca, a fortress between Caxamarca and Cuzco.  Atahualpa, realizing  how important such a man would be to the Spaniards, sent orders that he  be put to death and the unfortunate deposed Inca was therefore executed  by the two generals.  Although he was captive, Atahualpa's orders were  as implicitly obeyed as if he had been free.  He was still the Inca, if  only by the right of sword, and the forces of his generals were  sufficiently great to render it impossible for the son of Huascar,  named Manco Capac, who had escaped the massacre of his kinfolk and who  was the legitimate heir to the throne, to claim the crown.    Pizarro, with a fine show of rectitude, affected to be horrified by  this evidence of brutal cruelty, and although Atahualpa claimed no  connection with the assassination of Huascar, it was impossible to  acquit him of it.  Greatly desiring his freedom, Atahualpa, who had  observed the Spanish greed for gold, made an extraordinary proposition  to Pizarro.  They were together in a room twenty-two feet long by  seventeen feet broad.  Standing on his tiptoes and reaching as high as  he could, probably about eight feet,"]]]
