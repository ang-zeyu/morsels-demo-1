From _jamar_, the infinitive of \"to  eat,\" the regular conjugation should be _jame_, \"I have eaten.\" From  _lillar_, \"to take,\" _lille_, \"I have taken.\" Yet, some old gipsies  say, as an exception, _jayon_ and _lillon_. I am not acquainted with any  other verbs which have preserved this ancient form.    While I am thus showing off my small acquaintance with the _Romany_  language, I must notice a few words of French slang which our thieves  have borrowed from the gipsies. From _Les Mysteres de Paris_ honest  folk have learned that the word _chourin_ means \"a knife.\" This is  pure _Romany_--_tchouri_ is one of the words which is common to every  dialect. Monsieur Vidocq calls a horse _gres_--this again is a gipsy  word--_gras_, _gre_, _graste_, and _gris_. Add to this the word  _romanichel_, by which the gipsies are described in Parisian slang.  This is a corruption of _romane tchave_--\"gipsy lads.\" But a piece of  etymology of which I am really proud is that of the word _frimousse_,  \"face,\" \"countenance\"--a word which every schoolboy uses, or did use, in  my time. Note, in the first place, the Oudin, in his curious dictionary,  published in 1640, wrote the word _firlimouse_. Now in _Romany_,  _firla_, or _fila_, stands for \"face,\" and has the same meaning--it  is exactly the _os_ of the Latins. The combination of _firlamui_ was  instantly understood by a genuine gipsy, and I believe it to be true to  the spirit of the gipsy language.    I have surely said enough to give the readers of Carmen a favourable  idea of my _Romany_ studies. I will conclude with the following proverb,  which comes in very appropriately: _En retudi panda nasti abela macha_.  \"Between closed lips no fly can pass.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#14)"],[1,"w, but we did not then  know how to do any better.  I would have given much--even the  explosion--if I could have had a teatrino and real marionettes of my own,  as one of my Sicilian friends had when he was a boy; he dressed his own  dolls and made his own scenery, and used to do the _Odyssey_--a  first-rate subject that could easily be made to last two winters.    I was so much interested that I may have paid less attention this evening  to the story than to the working of the puppets.  The rods that pass  through their heads have wooden handles and end in hooks; across the  stage, pretty high up, were laid two horizontal laths with six or seven  chains hanging from them; when the paladins appeared, marching in one  after another and taking up their positions in two rows, as they  frequently did, what really happened was that an operator on one side  reached across and handed them over one by one to an operator on the  other side, who hooked them up into the chains, choosing the link  according to the height of the particular puppet in such a way that, if  possible, its feet just rested upon the stage.  After three or four had  been hooked up, the first operator could hang up the rest, and as soon as  the two rows were in their places Carlo Magno entered in front and  addressed them in a majestic voice.  During the pauses of his speech and  at its conclusion the paladins all murmured in agreement or shouted  \"Evviva\" which was done by us who were behind and, as there were thirteen  of us, it ought to have sounded fairly imposing.  Three of the thirteen  were regular operators, pretty constantly employed, who took off their  coats, waistcoats and shirts, and found it very hot work; of the  remainder some were authorized assistants, some were friends and one was  the reader--\"Lui che parla.\"    The siege of Marsilio's city was managed in this way.  First a scene was  let down as far back as possible on the stage.  This, Pasquale said,  represented \"una citta qualunque.\"  The collection of little wooden  houses on Captain Shandy's bowling-green was not a more perfect Proteus  of a town than Pasquale's back cloth.  This evening it was Barcelona.  In  front of it, about halfway to the footlights, was a low wall of  fortifications.  Just behind the fortifications the Spaniards were hooked  up into rather high links of the chains, so that, from the front, they  appeared to be looking over the wall and defending the city.  Carlo Magno  and his paladins brought ladders, scaled the wall, fought the Spaniards  and effected an entrance.  The fights were mostly duels.  At one time  there were three duels; that is, six knights were all fighting at once,  three on each side.  The places on the stage occupied by the front pair  were worn into hollows by their feet.  The damage sustained by the  figures in the fury of the combats is very great; their armour gets  broken, their draperies torn, their joints and the hinges of their vizors  are put out of order and there is much to be done to them before they can  appear again.    For the conclusion we came to the front and took our places as the  curtain drew up on a wood.  The Empress Marfisa entered in all her  bravery, riding cross-legged on her charger and looking round, first this  way, then that.  She was searching the wood for Bradamante who had  retired from the world to \"una grotta oscura\" to die of grief.  The  empress looked about and rode here and there but could see Bradamante  nowhere, so she rode away to search another part of the wood and the  scene changed.  We were now in the obscure grotto and here came Marfisa,  riding on her charger and looking about; she could see her sister-in-law  nowhere and was overcome with anxiety.  Presently, in the dim light, she  spied something on the ground; she dismounted, went far into the cave,  and--could it be?--yes, it was the unconscious form of Bradamante.  She  knelt down by her, embraced her and called her by her name, but there was  no reply.  She kissed her and called \"Bradamante,\" still there was no  reply.  She fondled her, and called her her \"dolce cognata,\"--her sweet  sister-in-law--and at length Bradamante raised herself with an effort,  recognized Marfisa and saying, \"Farewell, sister, I am dying,\" fell back  and expired.  An angel fluttered down, received her soul from her lips  and carried it up to heaven, while Marfisa wept over her body.    Then the dwarf came on and recited the programme for the next evening.  This was, as usual, followed by the last scene.  The paladins all marched  in--that is to say, they were handed over and hooked up in two rows, the  audience recognizing each, and saying his name as he took his place, and  Carlo Magna came and addressed them in a magnificent speech beginning--    \"Paladini! noi siamo stanchi.\"    Their fatigue was caused by their exertions at the siege of Barcelona and  their Emperor went on to promise them some repose before proceeding  against Madrid.    This epilogue struck me as out of place; nothing ought to have followed  the death of Bradamante, which was as affecting a scene as I have ever  witnessed.  The only hitch occurred when Marfisa dismounted; her left  foot came to the ground capitally, but her right would not come over her  saddle for some time; she got it free at last, however, and stood upright  on both feet.  I thought again of Master Peter's puppet-show and of how  the petticoat of the peerless Lady Melisendra caught in one of the iron  rails as she was letting herself down from the balcony, so that she hung  dangling in midair, and Don Gayferos had to bring her to the ground by  main force.    The rest of the scene in the grotto could not have gone better and the  audience were enthralled by it.  Yet what was it after all?  Nothing but  a couple of loosely jointed wooden dolls, fantastically dressed up in tin  armour, being pulled about on a toy stage.  Yet there was something more;  there was the voice of the reader--the voice of \"Lui che parla.\"  In the  earlier part of the evening he had been giving us fine declamation, which  was all that had been required.  The meeting between the two princesses  brought him his opportunity and he attacked the scene and carried it  through in a spirit of simple conviction, his voice throbbing with  emotion as he made for himself a triumph.    Art abounds in miracles, and not the least is this, that a man can take a  few watery commonplaces and by the magic of his voice transmute them into  the golden wine of romance.  The audience drank in the glowing drops that  poured from his lips, and were stilled to a silence that broke in a great  sob as the curtain fell.  What did they know of loosely jointed wooden  dolls or of toy stages?  They were no longer in the theatre.  They had  wandered the woods with Marfisa, they had sought Bradamante in the leafy  glades, they had found her dying in the grotto, they had received her  last breath and the world would never be the same to them again.  A voice  that can do this is rare and, like the power of a giant, rarely found in  the possession of one who knows how to use it worthily.          MOUNT ERYX      CHAPTER VIII--MONTE SAN GIULIANO      Three or four miles inland from Trapani, at the north-west corner of  Sicily, rises a precipitous solitary mountain, nearly 2500 feet high,  with a town on the top.  A motor bus makes a circuit of the mountain,  taking one up to the town in about an hour.  It proceeds inland, past the  church of the Annunziata, the famous shrine of the Madonna di Trapani,  and the ascent soon begins.  As one looks back towards the sea, Trapani  gradually assumes the form that gave it its Greek name of Drepanum, for  it juts out towards the island of Levanzo like a sickle \"with the sea  roaring all round it.\"  Marsala is usually visible beyond the innumerable  salt pans and windmills.  One of these windmills is especially pleasing;  it consists of five or six dummy ships with real sails on a pond; these  ships form, as it were, the rim of a wheel lying on its side, the spokes  being poles which attach the ships to the axle, an island in the middle  of the pond.  The wind blows and the ships race after one another round  and round the pond, causing the poles to work the mechanism which is  inside the island.    The manufacture of salt is one of the chief industries of Trapani and one  of the chief causes of its wealth.  In Sicily it practically never rains  during the summer; the sea water is collected in large, open pans, being  raised by means of the screw which has been in use all over the island  for nearly twenty-two centuries, ever since Archimedes invented it to  remove the water from the hold of one of Hiero's ships at Siracusa.  All  through the summer the heat of the sun evaporates the moisture, leaving  the salt which is afterwards exported to Newfoundland, Norway, the North  of France and many other countries and used for salting fish and other  purposes.    The road continues to ascend and the horizon appears to ascend also, so  that the sea takes up with it the AEgadean islands till, presently,  Marettimo looks over the top of Levanzo, while Favognana lies away to the  left.  The Isola Grande (S. Pantaleo), the fourth island, is not a  prominent object, being low and near the land, a good deal to the south  towards Marsala; but in former times, when it was Motya, it was the most  important of them all.  The sea extends right and left till it is lost in  the haze which so commonly obscures a Sicilian horizon.    The road goes more and more inland and, still rising, diverges from the  shorter road taken by the old horse bus and passes through Paparella.  Presently the mountain shuts out Trapani and the sea, and then the  country lying inland about the base of the mountain comes into view  bounded by a distant amphitheatre and, as the road completes the circuit  of the mountain, and still rising joins the other shorter road at the"]]]
