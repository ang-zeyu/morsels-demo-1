There is no doubt that, but for his immersion in public affairs in  middle life, Evelyn would have been a much larger producer of literary  work than he actually was. But it seems very questionable if this would  in any substantial way have added to the enduring reputation he won for  himself by _Sylva_.    In addition to his published works, however, he left numerous  manuscripts, which he had noted as 'Things I would write out faire and  reform if I had leisure,' comprising poems, mathematical papers,  religious meditations, and biographies. The most ambitious of his poems  is _Thyrsander, a Tragy-Comedy_, which is probably one of those referred  to by Pepys in his Diary for 5th Novr. 1665, when, visiting Evelyn at  Sayes Court, he says that 'He read me part of a play or two of his  making, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be.' Some of  these, including _My own Ephemeris or Diarie_, an autobiographical  memoir based on the journal or common-place book kept by him ever since  being eleven years of age, and his correspondence, were published  posthumously as _Memoirs illustrative of the Life and Writings of John  Evelyn Esqre. F.R.S._ in 1818. This has gone through nine editions and  reprints; and it affords, along with Pepys' diary, one of the best views  of the life of those times. Each is the complement of the other, and the  only matter of regret is that the original manuscript of Evelyn's actual  diary has not hitherto been forthcoming, as it would be infinitely  preferable to the compilation he made therefrom, which often refers to  future events. Other of his MSS. appeared as _Miscellaneous Writings of  John Evelyn Esq. F.R.S._ in 1825, _The Life of Mrs. Godolphin_ (see page  xlv) in 1847, and subsequently in five or six editions and reprints, and  _The History of Religion: A Rational Account of the True Religion_ in  1850. Of these the so-called _Diary_ is by far the most interesting and  important, and it is on it and on the _Sylva_ that his literary  reputation rests and has a sure and abiding foundation.      VIII    _Evelyn's Influence on British Arboriculture._    There can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and  throughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706,  has exerted more individual influence, through his charming _Sylva, or a  Discourse of Forest Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's  Dominion_ (first published in 1664) than can be ascribed to any other  individual. The attention drawn to the subject of Arboriculture by Dr.  Hunter towards the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the  nineteenth centuries was in connection with several new editions of that  classic work, while the impulse given to the formation of large  plantations between 1800 and 1830 by Sir Walter Scott and the celebrated  _Quarterly Review_ articles was connected very closely indeed with the  appearance of fresh editions of _Sylva_.    It is easy to understand the success of Evelyn's work and the influence  he exerted on British Arboriculture. First and foremost, he held the  brief in an excellent cause, because the maintenance of adequate  supplies of oak timber for shipbuilding ever remained a question of  very serious national importance right down to the time when this  pressure was removed by the introduction of steam communication and the  use of Indian Teak and subsequently of iron for purposes of  construction. Then again, his position as a courtier and a country  gentleman, and as one of the most prominent members of the recently  established Royal Society, gave him a much higher degree of prominence  than such adventitious aids would ensure in our present far more  democratic days. Finally, he had no small confidence in his own ability  ('conceit' his friend Mr. Samuel Pepys calls it in his diary); and this  has been recognised in the numerous editions of _Sylva_ that have from  time to time been found worthy of publication.    Although by far the most celebrated of English writers on Arboriculture,  Evelyn was by no means the first who wrote on this subject. That honour  belongs to Master Fitzherbert, whose _Boke of Husbandrie_ was published  in 1534. But it is a curious fact that the most important previous  contribution towards the propagation of timber--leaving Manwood's  _Treatise of the Forrest Lawes_ (1598) out of consideration--is  apparently never mentioned by Evelyn. This was a small booklet of 34  pages, a mere pamphlet in size, published in 1613 by Arthur Standish and  entitled _New Directions of Experience ... for the Increasing of Timber  and Firewood_. In this, Standish strongly urged sowing and planting on  an extensive scale; and the pamphlet was so highly approved by King  James I., that in 1615 a second edition was issued. This included, among  the prefatory matters, a royal proclamation 'By the King, To all  Noblemen, Gentlemen, and other our loving Subjects, to whom it may  appertaine,' which set forth the 'severall good projects for the  increasing of Woods' and recommended them to 'be willingly received and  put in practise' with a view to restore the decay of timber 'universally  complained of' within the realm.    Although exhortations and royal proclamations had previously been issued  more than once by James I. relative to the 'storing' of timber trees  when falls were being made in copsewoods, and generally to ensure better  effect being given to the intentions of Henry VIII's _Statute of Woods_  of 1543, as amended during Queen Elizabeth's reign (in 1570), yet  Standish's treatise was the first occasion (so far as I have been able  to discover) on which a private subject had endeavoured to stimulate the  progress of British Forestry by means of the publication of his views in  the form of a small book. His aims and objects are thus described on the  title-page of the second or royal edition of 1615:--\"NEW DIRECTIONS OF  EXPERIENCE AUTHORIZED BY THE King's most excellent Majesty, as may  appeare, for the increasing of Timber and Fire-wood, with the least  waste and losse of ground. WITH A NEARE ESTIMATION, what millions of  acres the Kingdome doth containe; what acres is waste ground, wherever  little profit for this purpose will arise--which waste being deducted,  the remaine is twenty-five millions; forth of which millions, if two  hundred and forty thousand Acres be planted and preserved according to  the directions following, which is but the hundred part of the  twenty-five millions, there may be as much timber raised, as will  maintaine the Kingdome for all uses for ever. And how as great store of  Fire-wood may be raised, forth of hedges, as may plentifully mainetaine  the Kingdome for all purposes, without losse of ground; so as within  thirty years all Spring-woods{lxvii:1} may be converted to Tillage and  Pasture. By Arthur Standish. Anno Domini MDCXV.\"    This was the only work of the sort which had been published up to the  time of Evelyn's _Sylva_ appearing about fifty years later, in 1662. It  is curious that he made no reference to this work written with similar  objects to those he himself had in view. Another work, however, he does  mention, evidently that of a practical horticulturist and  arboriculturist, probably belonging to a lower status of society than  himself. Writing of the _New Orchard and Garden_ (1597, 2nd. edit.  1623), he patronises the author by calling him 'our countryman honest  Lawson'; and after giving a long quotation from it with regard to  pruning, he complacently concludes by adding 'Thus far the good man out  of his eight and forty years experience concerning timber-trees.'    Evelyn had the satisfaction of seeing his work bear much fruit during  his own life-time, and this must have occasioned a quite exceptionally  keen pleasure to a man of his disposition. In his preface, dated 5  December 1678, to the fourth edition of _Sylva_, he writes in 'The  Epistle Dedicatory' to the King that 'I need not acquaint your Majesty  how many millions of timber-trees, besides infinite others, have been  propagated and planted throughout your vast dominions, at the  instigation, and by the sole directions of this work; because your  gracious Majesty had been pleased to own it publickly for my  encouragement, who in all that I here pretend to say, deliver only those  precepts which your Majesty has put in practise; as having, like another  Cyrus, by your own royal example, exceeded all your predecessors in the  plantations you have made, beyond, I dare assert it, all the Monarchs of  this nation, since the conquest of it.'    Apart from the planting done in the royal woods and forests, details of  Evelyn's diary shew that he was frequently called upon to give advice  with regard to laying out private plantations,--as well as of ornamental  gardens, on which subject he was also considered one of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#14)"],[1,"terraces  of Bethlehem? Is it not true, Jesus, that Thou art here present, and  that Thou showest me in reality Thy precious body? Is not Thy face here,  and that tear which flows down Thy cheek a real tear? Yes, the angel of  eternal justice shall receive it, and it shall be the ransom of the soul  of Thais. Art Thou not here, Jesus? Jesus, Thy loving lips open. Thou  canst speak; speak, I hear Thee! And thee, Thais, happy Thais! listen  to what the Saviour Himself says to thee; it is He who speaks, not I.  He says, 'I have sought thee long, O My lost sheep! I have found thee  at last! Fly from Me no more. Let Me take thee by the hands, poor little  one, and I will bear thee on My shoulders to the heavenly fold. Come, My  Thais! come, My chosen one! come, and weep with Me!'\"    And Paphnutius fell on his knees, his eyes filled with ecstasy. And then  Thais saw in his face the likeness of the living Christ.    \"O vanished days of my childhood!\" she sobbed. \"O sweet father Ahmes!  good Saint Theodore, why did I not die in thy white mantle whilst thou  didst bear me, in the first dawn of day, yet fresh from the waters of  baptism!\"    Paphnutius advanced towards her, crying--    \"Thou art baptised! O divine wisdom! O Providence! O great God! I know  now the power which drew me to thee. I know what rendered thee so dear  and so beautiful in my eyes. It was the virtue of the baptismal water,  which made me leave the shadow of God, where I lived, to seek thee in  the poisoned air where men dwell. A drop--a drop, no doubt, of the water  which washed thy body--has been sprinkled in my face. Come, O my sister,  and receive from thy brother the kiss of peace.\"    And the monk touched with his lips the forehead of the courtesan.    Then he was silent, letting God speak, and nothing was heard in the  Grotto of Nymphs but the sobs of Thais, mingled with the rippling of the  running water.    She wept without trying to stop her tears, when two black slaves  appeared, loaded with stuffs, perfumes, and garlands.    \"It was hardly the right time to weep,\" she said, trying to smile.  \"Tears redden the eyes and spoil the complexion, and I must sup tonight  with some friends, and want to be beautiful, for there will be women  there quick to spy out marks of care on my face. These slaves come to  dress me. Withdraw, my father, and allow them to do their work. They are  clever and experienced, and I pay them well for their services. You see  that one who wears thick rings of gold, and shows such white teeth. I  took her from the wife of the pro-consul.\"    Paphnutius had at first a thought of dissuading Thais, as earnestly as  he could, from going to this supper. But he determined to act prudently,  and asked what persons she would meet there.    She replied that there would be the host, old Cotta, the Prefect of the  Fleet, Nicias, and several other philosophers who loved an argument, the  poet Callicrates, the high priest of Serapis, some young men whose chief  amusement was training horses, and lastly some women, of whom there was  little to be said except that they were young. Then, by a supernatural  inspiration--    \"Go amongst them, Thais,\" said the monk. \"Go! But I will not leave thee.  I will go with thee to this banquet, and will remain by thy side without  saying a word.\"    She burst out laughing. And whilst her two black slaves were busy  dressing her, she cried--    \"What will they say when they see that I have a monk of the Thebaid for  my lover?\"          THE BANQUET    When, followed by Paphnutius, Thais entered the banqueting-room, the  guests were already, for the most part, assembled, and reclining  on their couches before the horseshoe table, which was covered with  glittering vessels. In the centre of the table stood a silver basin,  surmounted by four figures of satyrs, who poured out from wine-skins  on the boiled fish a kind of pickle in which they floated. When Thais  appeared, acclamations arose from all sides.    Greetings to the sister of the Graces!    To the silent Melpomene, who can express all things with her looks!    Salutation to the well-beloved of gods and men!    To the much desired!    To her who gives suffering and its cure!    To the pearl of Racotis!    To the rose of Alexandria!    She waited impatiently till this torrent of praise had passed, and then  said to Cotta, the host--    \"Lucius, I have brought you a monk of the desert, Paphnutius, the Abbot  of Antinoe. He is a great saint, whose words burn like fire.\"    Lucius Aurelius Cotta, the Prefect of the Fleet, rose, and replied--    \"You are welcome, Paphnutius, you who profess the Christian faith. I  myself have some respect of a religion that has now become imperial. The  divine Constantine has placed your co-religionists in the front rank of  the friends of the empire. Latin wisdom ought, in fact, to admit your  Christ into our pantheon. It was a maxim of our forefathers that there  was something divine in every god. But no more of that. Let us drink and  enjoy ourselves while there is yet time.\"    Old Cotta spoke tranquilly. He had just studied a new model for  a galley, and had finished the sixth book of his history of the  Carthaginians. He felt sure he had not lost his day, and was satisfied  with himself and the gods.    \"Paphnutius,\" he added, \"you see here several men who are worthy to be  loved--Hermodorus, the High Priest of Serapis; the philosophers Dorion,  Nicias, and Zenothemis; the poet Callicrates; young Chereas and young  Aristobulus, both sons of dear old comrades; and near them Philina and  Drosea, who deserve to be praised for their beauty.\"    Nicias embraced Paphnutius, and whispered in his ear--    \"I warned you, brother, that Venus was powerful. It is her gentle force  that has brought you here in spite of yourself. Listen: you are a man  full of piety, but if you do not confess that she is the mother of the  gods, your ruin is certain. Do you know that the old mathematician,  Melanthes, used to say, 'I cannot demonstrate the properties of a  triangle without the aid of Venus'?\"    Dorion, who had for some seconds been looking at the new-comer, suddenly  clapped his hands and uttered a cry of surprise.    \"It is he, friends! His look, his beard, his tunic--it is he himself!  I met him at the theatre whilst our Thais was acting. He was furiously  excited, and spoke with violence, as I can testify. He is an honest man,  but he will abuse us all; his eloquence is terrible. If Marcus is the  Plato of the Christians, Paphnutius is the Demosthenes. Epicurus, in his  little garden, never heard the like.\"    Philina and Drosea, however, devoured Thais with their eyes. She wore on  her fair hair a wreath of pale violets, each flower of which recalled,  in a paler hue, the colour of her eyes, so that the flowers looked  like softened glances, and the eyes like sparkling flowers. It was the  peculiar gift of this woman; on her everything lived, and was soul and  harmony. Her robe, which was of mauve spangled with silver, trailed in  long folds with a grace that was almost melancholy and was not relieved  by either bracelets or necklaces. The chief charm of her appearance  was her beautiful bare arms. The two friends were obliged to admire, in  spite of themselves the robe and head-dress of Thais, though they said  nothing to her on the subject.    \"How beautiful you are!\" said Philina. \"You could not have been more  so when you came to Alexandria. Yet my mother, who remembers seeing  you then, says there were few women who were worthy to be compared with  you.\"    \"Who is the new lover you have brought?\" asked Drosea. \"He has a  strange, wild appearance. If there are shepherds of elephants, assuredly  he must resemble one. Where did you find such a wild-looking friend,  Thais? Was it amongst the troglodytes who live under the earth, and are  grimy with the smoke of Hades?\"    But Philina put her finger on Drosea's lips.    \"Hush! the mysteries of love must remain secret, and it is forbidden to  know them. For my own part, certainly, I would rather be kissed by the  mouth of smoking Etna than by the lips of that man. But our dear  Thais, who is beautiful and adorable as the goddesses, should, like  the goddesses, grant all requests, and not, like us, only those of nice  young men.\"    \"Take care, both of you!\" replied Thais. \"He is a mage and an enchanter.  He hears words that are whispered, and even thoughts. He will tear out  your heart while you are asleep, and put a sponge in its place, and the  next day, when you drink water, you will be choked to death.\"    She watched them grow pale, then she turned away from them, and sat on a  couch by the side of Paphnutius. The voice of Cotta, kind but imperious,  was suddenly heard above the murmur of conversation.    \"Friends, let each take his place! Slaves, pour out the honeyed wine!\"    Then, the host raising his cup--    \"Let us first drink to the divine Constantine and the genius of the  empire. The country should be put first of all, even above the gods, for  it contains them all.\"    All the guests raised their full cups to their lips. Paphnutius alone  did not drink, because Constantine had persecuted the Nicaean faith, and  because the country of the Christian is not of this world.    Dorion, having drunk, murmured--    \"What is one's country? A flowing river. The shores change, and the  waves are incessantly renewed.\"    \"I know, Dorion,\" replied the Prefect of the Fleet, \"that you care  little for the civic virtues, and you think that the sage ought to hold  himself aloof from all affairs. I think, on the contrary, that an honest  man should desire nothing better than to fill a responsible post in the  State. The State is a noble thing.\"    Hermodorus, the High Priest of Serapis, spoke next--    \"Dorion has asked, 'What is one's country?' I will reply that the altars  of the gods and the tombs of ancestors make one's country. A man is a  fellow-citizen by"]]]
