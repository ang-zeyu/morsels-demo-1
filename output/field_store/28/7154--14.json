Sometimes also they say, that there is a charm in the  simple construction which is lost in the scientific one. This I am also  perfectly ready to grant. There is a charm in Stonehenge which there is  not in Amiens Cathedral, and a charm in an Alpine pine bridge which  there is not in the Ponte della Trinita at Florence, and, in general, a  charm in savageness which there is not in science. But do not let it be  said, therefore, that savageness _is_ science.    59. Proposition 2d.--_Ornamentation is the principal part of  architecture._ That is to say, the highest nobility of a building does  not consist in its being well built, but in its being nobly sculptured  or painted.    This is always, and at the first hearing of it, very naturally,  considered one of my most heretical propositions. It is also one of the  most important I have to maintain; and it must be permitted me to  explain it at some length. The first thing to be required of a  building--not, observe, the _highest_ thing, but the first thing--is  that it shall answer its purposes completely, permanently, and at the  smallest expense. If it is a house, it should be just of the size  convenient for its owner, containing exactly the kind and number of  rooms that he wants, with exactly the number of windows he wants, put in  the places that he wants. If it is a church, it should be just large  enough for its congregation, and of such shape and disposition as shall  make them comfortable in it and let them hear well in it. If it be a  public office, it should be so disposed as is most convenient for the  clerks in their daily avocations; and so on; all this being utterly  irrespective of external appearance or aesthetic considerations of any  kind, and all being done solidly, securely, and at the smallest  necessary cost.    The _sacrifice_ of any of these first requirements to external  appearance is a futility and absurdity. Rooms must not be darkened to  make the ranges of windows symmetrical. Useless wings must not be added  on one side, to balance useful wings on the other, but the house built  with one wing, if the owner has no need of two; and so on.    60. But observe, in doing all this, there is no High, or as it is  commonly called, Fine Art, required at all. There may be much science,  together with the lower form of art, or \"handicraft,\" but there is as  yet no _Fine Art_. House-building, on these terms, is no higher thing  than ship-building. It indeed will generally be found that the edifice  designed with this masculine reference to utility, will have a charm  about it, otherwise unattainable, just as a ship, constructed with  simple reference to its service against powers of wind and wave, turns  out one of the loveliest things that human hands produce. Still, we do  not, and properly do not, hold ship-building to be a fine art, nor  preserve in our memories the names of immortal ship-builders; neither,  so long as the mere utility and constructive merit of the building are  regarded, is architecture to be held a fine art, or are the names of  architects to be remembered immortally. For any one may at any time be  taught to build the ship, or (thus far) the house, and there is nothing  deserving of immortality in doing what any one may be taught to do.    But when the house, or church, or other building is thus far designed,  and the forms of its dead walls and dead roofs are up to this point  determined, comes the divine part of the work--namely, to turn these  dead walls into living ones. Only Deity, that is to say, those who are  taught by Deity, can do that.    And that is to be done by painting and sculpture, that is to say, by  ornamentation. Ornamentation is therefore the principal part of  architecture, considered as a subject of fine art.    61. Now observe. It will at once follow from this principle, that _a  great architect must be a great sculptor or painter_.    This is a universal law. No person who is not a great sculptor or  painter _can_ be an architect. If he is not a sculptor or painter, he  can only be a _builder_.    The three greatest architects hitherto known in the world were Phidias,  Giotto, and Michael Angelo; with all of whom, architecture was only  their play, sculpture and painting their work. All great works of  architecture in existence are either the work of single sculptors or  painters, or of societies of sculptors and painters, acting collectively  for a series of years. A Gothic cathedral is properly to be defined as a  piece of the most magnificent associative sculpture, arranged on the  noblest principles of building, for the service and delight of  multitudes; and the proper definition of architecture, as distinguished  from sculpture, is merely \"the art of designing sculpture for a  particular place, and placing it there on the best principles of  building.\"    Hence it clearly follows, that in modern days we have no _architects_.  The term \"architecture\" is not so much as understood by us. I am very  sorry to be compelled to the discourtesy of stating this fact, but a  fact it is, and a fact which it is necessary to state strongly.    Hence also it will follow, that the first thing necessary to the  possession of a school of architecture is the formation of a school of  able sculptors, and that till we have that, nothing we do can be called  architecture at all.    62. This, then, being my second proposition, the so-called \"architects\"  of the day, as the reader will imagine, are not willing to admit it, or  to admit any statement which at all involves it; and every statement,  tending in this direction, which I have hitherto made, has of course  been met by eager opposition; opposition which perhaps would have been  still more energetic, but that architects have not, I think, till  lately, been quite aware of the lengths to which I was prepared to carry  the principle.    The arguments, or assertions, which they generally employ against this  second proposition and its consequences, are the following:    First. That the true nobility of architecture consists, not in  decoration (or sculpture), but in the \"disposition of masses,\" and that  architecture is, in fact, the \"art of proportion.\"    63. It is difficult to overstate the enormity of the ignorance which  this popular statement implies. For the fact is, that _all_ art, and  all nature, depend on the \"disposition of masses.\" Painting, sculpture,  music, and poetry depend all equally on the \"proportion,\" whether of  colors, stones, notes, or words. Proportion is a principle, not of  architecture, but of existence. It is by the laws of proportion that  stars shine, that mountains stand, and rivers flow. Man can hardly  perform any act of his life, can hardly utter two words of innocent  speech, or move his hand in accordance with those words, without  involving some reference, whether taught or instinctive, to the laws of  proportion. And in the fine arts, it is impossible to move a single  step, or to execute the smallest and simplest piece of work, without  involving all those laws of proportion in their full complexity. To  arrange (by invention) the folds of a piece of drapery, or dispose the  locks of hair on the head of a statue, requires as much sense and  knowledge of the laws of proportion, as to dispose the masses of a  cathedral. The one are indeed smaller than the other, but the relations  between 1, 2, 4, and 8, are precisely the same as the relations between  6, 12, 24, and 48. So that the assertion that \"architecture is _par  excellence_ the art of proportion,\" could never be made except by  persons who know nothing of art in general; and, in fact, never _is_  made except by those architects, who, not being artists, fancy that the  one poor aesthetic principle of which they _are_ cognizant is the whole  of art. They find that the \"disposition of masses\" is the only thing of  importance in the art with which they are acquainted, and fancy  therefore that it is peculiar to that art; whereas the fact is, that all  great art _begins_ exactly where theirs _ends_, with the \"disposition of  masses.\" The assertion that Greek architecture, as opposed to Gothic  architecture, is the \"architecture of proportion,\" is another of the  results of the same broad ignorance. First, it is a calumny of the old  Greek style itself, which, like every other good architecture that ever  existed, depends more on its grand figure sculpture, than on its  proportions of parts; so that to copy the form of the Parthenon without  its friezes and frontal statuary, is like copying the figure of a human  being without its eyes and mouth; and, in the second place, so far as  modern Pseudo-Greek work _does_ depend on its proportions more than  Gothic work, it does so, not because it is better proportioned, but  because it has nothing _but_ proportion to depend upon. Gesture is in  like manner of more importance to a pantomime actor than to a tragedian,  not because his gesture is more refined, but because he has no tongue.  And the proportions of our common Greek work are important to it  undoubtedly, but not because they are or even can be more subtile than  Gothic proportion, but because that work has no sculpture, nor color,  nor imagination, nor sacredness, nor any other quality whatsoever in it,  but ratios of measures. And it is difficult to express with sufficient  force the absurdity of the supposition that there is more room for  refinements of proportion in the relations of seven or eight equal  pillars, with the triangular end of a roof above them, than between the  shafts, and buttresses, and porches, and pinnacles, and vaultings, and  towers, and all other doubly and trebly multiplied magnificences of  membership which form the framework of a Gothic temple.    64. Second reply.--It is often said, with some appearance of  plausibility, that I dwell in all my writings on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#14)"],[1,"       Seal Lullaby      All these things happened several years ago at a place called  Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and  away in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale  when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I  took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days  till he was fit to fly back to St. Paul's again. Limmershin is a very  quaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth.    Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people  who have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer  months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea.  For Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any  place in all the world.    Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place  he happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for  Novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good  place on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was  fifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his  shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved himself up on his  front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his  weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven  hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights,  but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head  on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face;  then he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were  firmly fixed on the other seal's neck, the other seal might get away if  he could, but Sea Catch would not help him.    Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules  of the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as  there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same  thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the  beach was something frightful.    From a little hill called Hutchinson's Hill, you could look over three  and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was  dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their  share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the  sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries,  for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives  never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they  did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and  four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about  half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the  sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green  thing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and  there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah  alone.    Sea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when  Matkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea,  and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his  reservation, saying gruffly: \"Late as usual. Where have you been?\"    It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four  months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad.  Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: \"How  thoughtful of you. You've taken the old place again.\"    \"I should think I had,\" said Sea Catch. \"Look at me!\"    He was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out,  and his sides were torn to ribbons.    \"Oh, you men, you men!\" Matkah said, fanning herself with her hind  flipper. \"Why can't you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You  look as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.\"    \"I haven't been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The  beach is disgracefully crowded this season. I've met at least a hundred  seals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why can't people stay where  they belong?\"    \"I've often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter  Island instead of this crowded place,\" said Matkah.    \"Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they  would say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.\"    Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended  to go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a  sharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were  on the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the  loudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals  on the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie,  fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going  down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying  over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing  about in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at  Novastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look  all pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.    Kotick, Matkah's baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he  was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals  must be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother  look at him very closely.    \"Sea Catch,\" she said, at last, \"our baby's going to be white!\"    \"Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!\" snorted Sea Catch. \"There never has  been such a thing in the world as a white seal.\"    \"I can't help that,\" said Matkah; \"there's going to be now.\" And she  sang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their  babies:         You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old,          Or your head will be sunk by your heels;       And summer gales and Killer Whales          Are bad for baby seals.         Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,          As bad as bad can be;       But splash and grow strong,       And you can't be wrong.          Child of the Open Sea!    Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He  paddled and scrambled about by his mother's side, and learned to scuffle  out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the  two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go  to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days,  but then he ate all he could and throve upon it.    The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens  of thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like  puppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old  people in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie  kept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.    When Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight  to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until  she heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight  lines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking  the youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few  hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and  the babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, \"So long as you  don't lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut  or scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy  sea, nothing will hurt you here.\"    Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy  till they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave  carried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little  hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song,  and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have  drowned.    After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the  waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always  kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks  learning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and  out of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and  took catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found  that he truly belonged to the water.    Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking  under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a  swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or  standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did;  or playing \"I'm the King of the Castle\" on slippery, weedy rocks that  just stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like  a big shark's fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that  was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get  them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin  would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.    Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul's for the deep sea, by  families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,  and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. \"Next year,\" said  Matkah to Kotick, \"you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must  learn how to catch fish.\"    They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how  to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his  little nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the  long, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all  over, Matkah told him he was learning the \"feel of the water,\" and that  tingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard  and"]]]
