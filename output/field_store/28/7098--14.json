After this the robin came every day, and he sang so sweetly for her that  she almost forgot her loneliness and misery. But once while the robin  was with her the tyrant king's daughter, who was very beautiful, passed  with her maids of honor, and, seeing Rosaleen, the princess said:    \"Oh, there is that horrid ugly thing.\"    The maids laughed and giggled, and said they had never seen such a  fright.    Poor Rosaleen felt as if her heart would break, and when the princess  and her maids were out of sight she almost cried her eyes out. When the  robin saw her crying he perched on her shoulder and rubbed his little  head against her neck and chirruped softly in her ear, and Rosaleen  was comforted, for she felt she had at least one friend in the world,  although it was only a little robin. But the robin could do more for  her than she could dream of. He heard the remark made by the princess,  and he saw Rosaleen's tears, and he knew now why she was shunned by  everybody, and why she was so unhappy. And that very evening he flew off  to Dooros Wood, and called on a cousin of his and told him all about  Rosaleen.    \"And you want some of the fairy berries, I suppose,\" said his cousin,  Robin of the Wood.    \"I do,\" said Rosaleen's little friend.    \"Ah,\" said Robin of the Wood, \"times have changed since you were here  last. The tree is guarded now all the day long by a surly giant. He  sleeps in the branches during the night, and he breathes upon them and  around them every morning, and his breath is poison to bird and bee.  There is only one chance open, and if you try that it may cost you  your life.\"    \"Then tell me what it is, for I would give a hundred lives for  Rosaleen,\" said her own little robin.    \"Well,\" said Robin of the Wood, \"every day a champion comes to battle  with the giant, and the giant, before he begins the fight, puts a branch  of berries in the iron belt that's around his waist, so that when he  feels tired or thirsty he can refresh himself, and there is just a bare  chance, while he is fighting, of picking one of the berries from the  branch; but if his breath fall on you it is certain death.\"    \"I will take the chance,\" said Rosaleen's robin.    \"Very well,\" said the other. And the two birds flew through the wood  until they came within sight of the fairy tree. The giant was lying  stretched at the foot of it, eating the berries; but it was not long  until a warrior came, who challenged him to battle. The giant jumped up,  and plucking a branch from the tree stuck it in his belt, and swinging  his iron club above his head strode towards the warrior, and the fight  began. The robin perched on a tree behind the giant, and watched and  waited for his chance; but it was a long time coming, for the berries  were in front of the giant's belt. At last the giant, with one great  blow, struck the warrior down, but as he did so he stumbled and fell  upon him, and before he had time to recover himself the little robin  darted towards him like a flash and picked off one of the berries, and  then, as fast as wings could carry him, he flew towards home, and on his  way he passed over a troop of warriors on snow-white steeds. All the  horsemen except one wore silver helmets and shining mantles of green  silk, fastened by brooches of red gold, but the chief, who rode at the  head of the troop, wore a golden helmet, and his mantle was of yellow  silk, and he looked by far the noblest of them all. When the robin had  left the horsemen far behind him he spied Rosaleen sitting outside the  palace gates bemoaning her fate. The robin perched upon her shoulder,  and almost before she knew he was there he put the berry between her  lips, and the taste was so delicious that Rosaleen ate it at once, and  that very moment the witch's withering spell passed away from her, and  she became as lovely as the flower of beauty. Just then the warriors on  the snow-white steeds came up, and the chief with the mantle of yellow  silk and the golden helmet leaped from his horse, and bending his knee  before her, said:    \"Fairest of all fair maidens, you are surely the daughter of the king of  these realms, even though you are without the palace gates, unattended,  and wear not royal robes. I am the Prince of the Sunny Valleys.\"    \"Daughter of a king I am,\" said Rosaleen, \"but not of the king who rules  these realms.\"    And saying this she fled, leaving the prince wondering who she could be.  The prince then ordered his trumpeters to give notice of his presence  outside the palace, and in a few moments the king and all his nobles  came out to greet the prince and his warriors, and give them welcome.  That night a great feast was spread in the banquet hall, and the Prince  of the Sunny Valleys sat by the king, and beside the prince sat the  king's beautiful daughter, and then in due order sat the nobles of the  court and the warriors who had come with the prince, and on the wall  behind each noble and warrior his shield and helmet were suspended,  flashing radiance through the room. During the feast the prince spoke  most graciously to the lovely lady at his side, but all the time he was  thinking of the unknown beauty he had met outside the palace gates, and  his heart longed for another glimpse of her. When the feast was ended,  and the jeweled drinking-cups had gone merrily around the table, the  bards sang, to the accompaniment of harps, the \"Courtship of the Lady  Eimer,\" and as they pictured her radiant beauty outshining that of all  her maidens, the prince thought that fair as Lady Eimer was there was  one still fairer.    When the feast was ended the king asked the prince what brought him into  his realms.    \"I come,\" said the prince, \"to look for a bride, for it was foretold  to me in my own country that here only I should find the lady who is  destined to share my throne, and fame reported that in your kingdom are  to be found the loveliest maidens in all the world, and I can well  believe that,\" added the prince, \"after what I have seen to-day.\"    When the king's daughter heard this she hung down her head and blushed  like a rose, for, of course, she thought the prince was alluding only to  herself, as she did not know that he had seen Rosaleen, and she had not  heard of the restoration of her beauty.    Before another word could be spoken a great noise and the clang of arms  were heard outside the palace. The king and his guests started from  their seats and drew their swords, and the bards raised the song of  battle; but their voices were stilled and their harps silenced when they  saw at the threshold of the banquet hall a battle champion, in whose  face they recognized the features of their murdered king.    \"'Tis Niall come back to claim his father's throne,\" said the chief  bard. \"Long live Niall!\"    \"Long live Niall!\" answered all the others.    The king, white with rage and amazement, turned to the chiefs and nobles  of his court, and cried out:    \"Is there none loyal enough to drive that intruder from the banquet  hall?\"    But no one stirred, and no answer was given. Then the king rushed  forward alone, but before he could reach the spot where Niall was  standing he was seized by a dozen chiefs and at once disarmed.    During this scene the king's daughter had fled frightened; but Rosaleen,  attracted by the noise, and hearing her brother's name and the cheers  which greeted it, had entered the banquet hall unperceived by anyone.  But when her presence was discovered every eye was dazzled with her  beauty. Niall looked at her for a second, wondering if the radiant  maiden before him could be the little sister he had been separated from  for so many years. In another second she was clasped in his arms.    Then the feast was spread again, and Niall told the story of his  adventures; and when the Prince of the Sunny Valley asked for the hand  of Rosaleen, Niall told his lovely sister to speak for herself. With  downcast eyes and smiling lips she said, \"yes,\" and that very day was  the gayest and brightest wedding that ever took place, and Rosaleen  became the prince's bride.    In her happiness she did not forget the little robin, who was her friend  in sorrow. She took him home with her to Sunny Valleys, and every day  she fed him with her own hands, and every day he sang for her the  sweetest songs that were ever heard in lady's bower.          THE LITTLE WHITE CAT      A long, long time ago, in a valley far away, the giant Trencoss lived in  a great castle, surrounded by trees that were always green. The castle  had a hundred doors, and every door was guarded by a huge, shaggy hound,  with tongue of fire and claws of iron, who tore to pieces anyone who  went to the castle without the giant's leave. Trencoss had made war on  the King of the Torrents, and, having killed the king, and slain his  people, and burned his palace, he carried off his only daughter, the  Princess Eileen, to the castle in the valley. Here he provided her with  beautiful rooms, and appointed a hundred dwarfs, dressed in blue and  yellow satin, to wait upon her, and harpers to play sweet music for her,  and he gave her diamonds without number, brighter than the sun; but he  would not allow her to go outside the castle, and told her if she went  one step beyond its doors, the hounds, with tongues of fire and claws of  iron, would tear her to pieces. A week after her arrival, war broke out  between the giant and the King of the Islands, and before he set out for  battle, the giant sent for the princess, and informed her that on his  return he would make her his wife. When the princess heard this she  began to cry, for she would rather die than marry the giant who had  slain her father.    \"Crying will only spoil your bright eyes, my little princess,\" said  Trencoss, \"and you will have to marry me whether you like it or no.\"    He then bade her go back to her room, and he ordered the dwarfs to give  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#14)"],[1,"soon his  carack was a mere unrigged helmless waterlog, only saved from instant  destruction by her immense size and terrific guns, which, well aimed,  low on the water, to gain the _ricochet_, did fearful mischief among  the attacking galleys. Two galleons were burnt to the water's edge,  and their crews took to the boats; a third, Boccanegra's, lost her  mainmast, and staggered away crippled. What was Doria about? The wind  was now in his favour; the enemy was in front: but Doria continued to  tack and manoeuvre at a distance. What he aimed at is uncertain: his  colleagues Grimani and Capello went on board his flagship, and  vehemently remonstrated with him, and even implored him to depart and  let them fight the battle with their own ships, but in vain. He was  bent on tactics, when what was needed was pluck; and tactics lost the  day. The Corsairs took, it is true, only seven galleys and sailing  vessels, but they held the sea. Doria sailed away in the evening for  Corfu, and the whole allied fleet followed in a gale of wind.[36]    [Illustration: OBSERVATION WITH THE ASTROLABE.    (_Jurien de la Graviere._)]    So, after all, the great duel was never fairly fought between the  sea-rivals. Barbarossa was willing, but Doria held back: he preferred  to show his seamanship instead of his courage. The result was in  effect a victory, a signal victory, for the Turks. Two hundred  splendid vessels of three great Christian states had fled before an  inferior force of Ottomans; and it is no wonder that Sultan  Suleym[=a]n, when he learnt the news at Yamboli, illuminated the town,  and added one hundred thousand aspres a year to the revenues of the  conqueror. Barbarossa had once more proved to the world that the  Turkish fleet was invincible. The flag of Suleym[=a]n floated supreme  in all the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.

Barbarossa's life was drawing to a close, but in the eight years that  remained he enhanced his already unrivalled renown. His first exploit  after Prevesa was the recapture of Castelnuovo, which the allied  fleets had seized in October, as some compensation on land for their  humiliation at sea. The Turkish armies had failed to recover the  fortress in January, 1539; but in July Barbarossa went to the front as  usual, with a fleet of two hundred galleys, large and small, and all  his best captains; and, after some very pretty fighting in the Gulf of  Cattaro, landed eighty-four of his heaviest guns and bombarded  Castelnuovo, from three well-placed batteries. On August 7th, a  sanguinary assault secured the first line of the defences; three days  later the governor, Don Francisco Sarmiento, and his handful of  Spaniards, surrendered to a final assault, and were surprised to find  themselves chivalrously respected as honourable foes. Three thousand  Spaniards had fallen, and eight thousand Turks, in the course of the  siege.    One more campaign and Barbarossa's feats are over. Great events were  happening on the Algerine coasts, where we must return after too long  an absence in the Levant and Adriatic: but first the order of years  must be neglected that we may see the last of the most famous of all  the Corsairs. To make amends for the coldness of Henry VIII., Francis  I. was allied with the other great maritime power, Turkey, against the  Emperor, in 1543; and the old sea rover actually brought his fleet of  one hundred and fifty ships to Marseilles. The French captains saluted  the Corsair's _capitana_, and the banner of Our Lady was lowered to be  replaced by the Crescent. Well may a French admiral call this \"the  impious alliance.\" On his way Barbarossa enjoyed a raid in quite his  old style; burnt Reggio and carried off the governor's daughter;  appeared off the Tiber, and terrified the people of Civita Vecchia;  and in July entered the Gulf of Lyons in triumph. Here he found the  young Duke of Enghien, Francois de Bourbon, commander of the French  galleys, who received him with all honour and ceremony.    [Illustration: GALLEY AT ANCHOR.    (_Jurien de la Graviere._)]    Barbarossa had hardly arrived when he discovered that his great  expedition was but a fool's errand. The King of France was afraid of  attempting a serious campaign against the Emperor, and he was already  ashamed of his alliance with the Musulmans: his own subjects--nay, all  Europe--were crying shame. Barbarossa grew crimson with fury, and tore  his white beard: he had not come with a vast fleet all the way from  Stambol to be made a laughing-stock. Something must evidentially be  done to satisfy his honour, and Francis I. unwillingly gave orders for  the bombardment of Nice. Accompanied by a feeble and ill-prepared  French contingent, which soon ran short of ammunition--\"Fine  soldiers,\" cried the Corsair, \"to fill their ships with wine casks,  and leave the powder barrels behind!\"--Barbarossa descended upon the  Gate of Italy. The city soon surrendered, but the fort held out,  defended by one of those invincible foes of the Turk, a Knight of  Malta, Paolo Simeoni, who had himself experienced captivity at the  hands of Barbarossa; and as the French protested against sacking the  town after capitulation on terms, and as Charles's relieving army was  advancing, the camps were broken up in confusion, and the fleets  retired from Nice.    The people of Toulon beheld a strange spectacle that winter. The  beautiful harbour of Provence was allotted to the Turkish admiral for  his winter quarters. There, at anchor, lay the immense fleet of the  Grand Signior; and who knew how long it might dominate the fairest  province of France? There, turbaned Musulmans paced the decks and  bridge, below and beside which hundreds of Christian slaves sat  chained to the bench and victims to the lash of the boatswain.  Frenchmen were forced to look on, helplessly, while Frenchmen groaned  in the infidels' galleys, within the security of a French port. The  captives died by hundreds of fever during that winter, but no  Christian burial was allowed them--even the bells that summon the  pious to the Mass were silenced, for are they not \"the devil's  musical instrument\"?[37]--and the gaps in the benches were filled by  nightly raids among the neighbouring villages. It was ill sleeping  around Toulon when the Corsair press-gangs were abroad. And to feed  and pay these rapacious allies was a task that went near to ruining  the finances of France.    The French were not satisfied of the Corsair's fidelity, and it must  be added that the Emperor might have had some reason to doubt the  honesty of Doria. The two greatest admirals of the age were both in  the Western Mediterranean, but nothing could tempt them to come to  blows. The truth was that each had a great reputation to lose, and  each preferred to go to his grave with all his fame undimmed. Francis  I. had a suspicion that Barbarossa was meditating the surrender of  Toulon to the Emperor, and, improbable as it was, some colour was  given to the King's anxiety by the amicable relations which seemed to  subsist between the Genoese Corsair and his Barbary rival. Doria gave  up the captive Dragut to his old captain for a ransom of three  thousand gold crowns--a transaction on which he afterwards looked back  with unqualified regret. The situation was growing daily more  unpleasant for France. From his easy position in Toulon, Barbarossa  sent forth squadrons under S[=a]lih Reis and other commanders to lay  waste the coasts of Spain, while he remained \"lazily engaged in  emptying the coffers of the French king.\"    At last they got rid of him. Francis was compelled to furnish the pay  and rations of the whole crews and troops of the Ottoman fleet up to  their re-entry into the Bosphorus; he had to free four hundred  Mohammedan galley slaves and deliver them to Barbarossa; he loaded him  with jewellery, silks, and other presents; the Corsair departed in a  Corsair's style, weighed down with spoil. His homeward voyage was one  long harrying of the Italian coasts; his galley sailed low with human  freight; and his arrival at Constantinople was the signal for the  filling of all the harems of the great pashas with beautiful captives.  Barbarossa, laden with such gifts, was sure of his welcome.    Two years later he died, in July, 1546, an old man of perhaps near  ninety, yet without surviving his great fame. \"Valorous yet prudent,  furious in attack, foreseeing in preparation,\" he ranks as the first  sea captain of his time. \"The chief of the sea is dead,\" expressed in  three Arabic words, gives the numerical value 953, the year of the  Hijra in which Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n Barbarossa died.    Long afterwards no Turkish fleet left the Golden Horn without her crew  repeating a prayer and firing a salute over the tomb at Beshiktash,  where lie the bones of the first great Turkish admiral.

When Barbarossa left Algiers for ever in 1535 to become the High  Admiral of the Ottoman Empire, the Corsairs lost indeed their chief;  but so many of his captains remained behind that the game of sea  roving went on as merrily as ever. Indeed so fierce and ruthless were  their depredations that the people of Italy and Spain and the islands  began to regret the attentions of so gentlemanly a robber as  Barbarossa. His successor or viceroy at Algiers was a Sardinian  renegade, Hasan the Eunuch; but the chief commanders at sea were  Dragut, S[=a]lih Reis, Sin[=a]n, and the rest, who, when not called to  join the Captain Pasha's fleet,"]]]
