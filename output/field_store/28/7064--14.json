So when the chamber was finished, the  king stored his money in it, and after some time the builder, being near  the end of his life, called to him his sons (for he had two) and to them  he related how he had contrived in building the treasury of the king,  and all in forethought for them, that they might have ample means of  living. And when he had clearly set forth to them everything concerning  the taking out of the stone, he gave them the measurements, saying that  if they paid heed to this matter they would be stewards of the king's  treasury. So he ended his life, and his sons made no long delay in  setting to work, but went to the palace by night, and having found the  stone in the wall of the chamber they dealt with it easily and carried  forth for themselves great quantity of the wealth within. And the king  happening to open the chamber, he marvelled when he saw the vessels  falling short of the full amount, and he did not know on whom he should  lay the blame, since the seals were unbroken and the chamber had been  close shut; but when upon his opening the chamber a second and a third  time the money was each time seen to be diminished, for the thieves  did not slacken in their assaults upon it, he did as follows:--having  ordered traps to be made he set these round about the vessels in which  the money was; and when the thieves had come as at former times and one  of them had entered, then so soon as he came near to one of the vessels  he was straightway caught in the trap: and when he perceived in what  evil case he was, straightway calling his brother he showed him what the  matter was, and bade him enter as quickly as possible and cut off  his head, for fear lest being seen and known he might bring about the  destruction of his brother also. And to the other it seemed that he  spoke well, and he was persuaded and did so; and fitting the stone into  its place he departed home bearing with him the head of his brother.  Now when it became day, the king entered into the chamber and was very  greatly amazed, seeing the body of the thief held in the trap without  his head, and the chamber unbroken, with no way to come in by or go out:  and being at a loss he hung up the dead body of the thief upon the  wall and set guards there, with charge if they saw any one weeping or  bewailing himself to seize him and bring him before the king. And when  the dead body had been hung up, the mother was greatly grieved, and  speaking with the son who survived she enjoined him, in whatever way he  could, to contrive means by which he might take down and bring home the  body of his brother; and if he should neglect to do this, she earnestly  threatened that she would go and give information to the king that he  had the money. So as the mother dealt hardly with the surviving son, and  he though saying many things to her did not persuade her, he contrived  for his purpose a device as follows:--Providing himself with asses he  filled some skins with wine and laid them upon the asses, and after  that he drove them along: and when he came opposite to those who were  guarding the corpse hung up, he drew towards him two or three of the  necks of the skins and loosened the cords with which they were tied.  Then when the wine was running out, he began to beat his head and cry  out loudly, as if he did not know to which of the asses he should first  turn; and when the guards saw the wine flowing out in streams, they ran  together to the road with drinking vessels in their hands and collected  the wine that was poured out, counting it so much gain; and he abused  them all violently, making as if he were angry, but when the guards  tried to appease him, after a time he feigned to be pacified and to  abate his anger, and at length he drove his asses out of the road and  began to set their loads right. Then more talk arose among them, and one  or two of them made jests at him and brought him to laugh with them;  and in the end he made them a present of one of the skins in addition  to what they had. Upon that they lay down there without more ado, being  minded to drink, and they took him into their company and invited him  to remain with them and join them in their drinking: so he (as may be  supposed) was persuaded and stayed. Then as they in their drinking bade  him welcome in a friendly manner, he made a present to them also of  another of the skins; and so at length having drunk liberally the guards  became completely intoxicated; and being overcome by sleep they went to  bed on the spot where they had been drinking. He then, as it was now far  on in the night, first took down the body of his brother, and then in  mockery shaved the right cheeks of all the guards; and after that he  put the dead body upon the asses and drove them away home, having  accomplished that which was enjoined him by his mother. Upon this the  king, when it was reported to him that the dead body of the thief had  been stolen away, displayed great anger; and desiring by all means that  it should be found out who it might be who devised these things, did  this (so at least they said, but I do not believe the account),--he  caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and enjoined her to receive  all equally, and before having commerce with any one to compel him to  tell her what was the most cunning and what the most unholy deed which  had been done by him in all his life-time; and whosoever should relate  that which had happened about the thief, him she must seize and not let  him go out. Then as she was doing that which was enjoined by her father,  the thief, hearing for what purpose this was done and having a desire to  get the better of the king in resource, did thus:--from the body of one  lately dead he cut off the arm at the shoulder and went with it under  his mantle: and having gone in to the daughter of the king, and being  asked that which the others also were asked, he related that he had done  the most unholy deed when he cut off the head of his brother, who had  been caught in a trap in the king's treasure-chamber, and the most  cunning deed in that he made drunk the guards and took down the dead  body of his brother hanging up; and she when she heard it tried to take  hold of him, but the thief held out to her in the darkness the arm of  the corpse, which she grasped and held, thinking that she was holding  the arm of the man himself; but the thief left it in her hands and  departed, escaping through the door. Now when this also was reported to  the king, he was at first amazed at the ready invention and daring of  the fellow, and then afterwards he sent round to all the cities and made  proclamation granting a free pardon to the thief, and also promising a  great reward if he would come into his presence. The thief accordingly  trusting to the proclamation came to the king, and Rhampsinitos greatly  marvelled at him, and gave him this daughter of his to wife, counting  him to be the most knowing of all men; for as the Egyptians were  distinguished from all other men, so was he from the other Egyptians.    After these things they said this king went down alive to that place  which by the Hellenes is called Hades, and there played at dice with  Demeter, and in some throws he overcame her and in others he was  overcome by her; and he came back again having as a gift from her a  handkerchief of gold: and they told me that because of the going down of  Rhampsinitos the Egyptians after he came back celebrated a feast, which  I know of my own knowledge also that they still observe even to my time;  but whether it is for this cause that they keep the feast or for  some other, I am not able to say. However, the priests weave a robe  completely on the very day of the feast, and forthwith they bind up the  eyes of one of them with a fillet, and having led him with the robe to  the way by which one goes to the temple of Demeter, they depart back  again themselves. This priest, they say, with his eyes bound up is led  by two wolves to the temple of Demeter, which is distant from the city  twenty furlongs, and then afterwards the wolves lead him back again from  the temple to the same spot. Now as to the tales told by the Egyptians,  any man may accept them to whom such things appear credible; as for me,  it is to be understood throughout the whole of the history that I write  by hearsay that which is reported by the people in each place. The  Egyptians say that Demeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below;  and the Egyptians are also the first who reported the doctrine that the  soul of man is immortal, and that when the body dies, the soul enters  into another creature which chances then to be coming to the birth, and  when it has gone the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of  the air, it enters again into a human body as it comes to the birth;  and that it makes this round in a period of three thousand years. This  doctrine certain Hellenes adopted, some earlier and some later, as if  it were of their own invention, and of these men I know the names but I  abstain from recording them.    Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there was in  Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt prospered greatly; but after  him Cheops became king over them and brought them to every kind of  evil: for he shut up all the temples, and having first kept them from  sacrifices there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for him. So some  were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian  mountains to the Nile, and others he ordered to receive the stones after  they had been carried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#14)"],[1,"it with buns;  but he did not confess to the fact that it was his most profitable  animal, from the circumstance of his letting it out on hire for so many  months in the year to a hairdresser in Bloomsbury, who used, according  to his advertisements, to kill it regularly once a week and exhibit it  in butcherly fashion hung up and spread open outside his shop, so that  passers-by might see its tremendous state of fatness: \"Another fat bear  killed this morning.\"    It was in the days when the British public were intense believers in  bear's grease as the producer of hair, and no one troubled himself or  herself to investigate the precise configuration of the exhibited animal  and compare it when hung up, decapitated, and shorn of its feet, with  the ordinary well-fatted domestic pig, albeit the illusion was kept up  by its being possible to see through the gratings outside the  shop-window Ramball's black bear still \"all alive-o,\" parading and  snuffling up and down in the area.    Glyn and Singh were there, of course, and responded to Ramball's almost  obsequious advances with good-humoured tolerance; but while he was with  the Doctor the boys took notes together, laughing with a good deal of  contempt at the poor miserable specimens--the tiger and two leopards--  compared with those they had seen in their native beauty and grace of  outline in the forests of Dour.    They met one friend there, though, chained by a leg to the massive iron  peg, as he stood swinging his great head from side to side, and  stretching out his enormous trunk for the contributions supplied by the  boys.    They were welcomed most effusively by the great beast, which recognised  them at once, and it was only by its attention being taken up by its  keeper, the man who had driven the bottomless van, that the boys got  away without being followed by their new friend, which had manifested a  disposition to drag the peg out of the ground and follow them like a  dog.    It was while the Doctor was delivering an impromptu disquisition upon  the peculiarities of the one-horned rhinoceros and the slight  resemblance given by the folds of its monstrous hide to the shell of a  turtle, that Ramball followed the two boys and made signs to them to  come to the other end of the great van-walled booth, when he asked them  if they had considered his proposition.    \"I never made such an offer before in my life, young gents.  It's a good  'un.  Don't you let it slide.\"    But the boys were saved the pain of telling the man that it was quite  out of the question by the coming up of the guest at the Doctor's  dinner, Professor Barclay, who was effusively civil to Glyn, and  fastened himself upon Singh to talk of Indian matters and language till  the visit came to an end.    Just before leaving, Ramball came up to them again, but he had to speak  in the presence of the Doctor.    \"I only wanted to ask the young gents, sir,\" he said, \"if they had made  their choice of the two little somethings to keep in remembrance of what  they did over the elephant.\"    \"Two little somethings?\" said the Doctor loftily.  \"I am quite sure,  sir, that my pupils do not wish to take any two little somethings as a  gift from you.\"    \"No, no, sir, not what you call gifts; but just a couple of little  trifles as I asked them to pick out.\"    \"Oh, no, no,\" cried the Doctor.  \"It is not necessary, my man, and we  have no room for such things in my establishment.\"    \"Ah, excuse me, sir,\" said the man eagerly; \"you are thinking I mean  something big and awkward; but a nice little monkey, sir, or a bird?\"    \"Monkeys don't want monkeys,\" said Slegge, in a whisper to Burney, just  loud enough for Glyn to hear, and making him turn sharply upon the  speaker.    \"Have a baboon, Severn,\" said Slegge maliciously, for he met the boy's  flashing eyes.    \"What for?\" said Glyn coolly.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" continued Slegge, after a glance at the boys around,  who burst into a low series of titters.  \"I would if I were you.  There's a nice brotherly look about that one in the cage, and he hasn't  got a tail.\"    \"Mr Severn,\" said the Doctor, \"come here.  I want you to tell Mr  Ramball that you do not need any recompense for the services you have  performed.  Mr Singh has already spoken.\"    \"Yes, sir, I'll come,\" replied the boy quickly, and he did as requested,  fully conscious the while that Slegge was saying something disparaging  to the nearest boys, and that the Professor had moved up behind Singh  and was talking to him again.    \"Do you like this Professor Barclay?\" said Glyn as they were walking  back towards the school side by side.    \"Oh, I don't know.  He's very pleasant to talk to, of course, for he  knows so much about Indian things.\"    \"Oh,\" said Glyn thoughtfully, for his companion's words sounded  reasonable.    \"But what was that fellow saying to you?\" asked Singh.  \"He was grinning  at you about something.  Oh, I should like to do something to him.  That  nasty look of his always makes me feel hot.\"    \"He wants to get up a quarrel,\" replied Glyn.    \"Well, let him, and the sooner the better.  He's always insulting me.\"    \"Then let's insult him,\" said Glyn.    \"Yes,\" cried Singh eagerly.  \"What shall we do?  Tell him we won't  accept a baboon because one's enough in the school?\"    \"No; treat him with contempt,\" said Glyn coldly.  \"We are not going to  be dragged into a fight so as to give him a chance to play the bully and  knock us about.\"    \"But let's knock him about,\" cried Singh, \"and show him that we can  bully too.\"    \"Won't do,\" said Glyn slowly.  \"He's too big and strong.\"    \"Yes, he's big and strong; but we shall be two to one.\"    \"Ah, you have a lot to learn, Singhy.  English gentlemen don't fight  like that.\"        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    THE CUTTING OF THE COCK'S COMB.    There was a smart brush at the school a few days later, which resulted  in the cutting of Slegge's comb.  The Doctor was seated at his  study-table, with the open French window letting in the fresh morning  breeze and giving him a view, when he raised his eyes from his book,  right across the cricket-field to the clump of elms, when there was a  tap at the door, responded to by the customary \"Come in!\" and Mr  Rampson entered.    \"Ah, good-morning, Mr Rampson,\" said the Doctor suavely.    \"Good-morning, sir.  Could you give me a few minutes?\"    \"Certainly, Mr Rampson,\" replied the Doctor, sitting back.  \"Have you  something to report?\"    \"Well, no, sir, not exactly, but--er, but er--I er--thought I should  like to ask you if I had given you satisfaction in connection with my  pupils.\"    \"Yes, Mr Rampson,\" said the Doctor, raising his eyebrows; \"but why--oh,  I see, you want to speak to me and tell me that you have had a more  lucrative offer.\"    \"Oh no, sir; I am quite satisfied here, where I have been so long,  but--\"    \"Well, Mr Rampson, what is it?  You wish me to increase your stipend?\"    \"No, sir, I do not; but I don't want to suddenly find myself supplanted  by another master through the machinations of a brother-teacher.\"    \"Don't speak angrily, Mr Rampson.  Pray, who has been trying to  supplant you?\"    \"Well, sir, I am a blunt man, and I have come to speak out.  I am afraid  that Morris--why, I know not--has been introducing this Professor  Barclay to you to try to get him in my post.\"    \"Indeed, Mr Rampson!\" said the Doctor, with a smile.  \"Well, then, let  me set you at your ease at once.  Morris did not introduce this  gentleman, for he came to me with an introduction from one of the  professors at Addiscombe, a gentleman I do not know from Adam.  I find  that he has been for a few months a resident in the town here, where he  is carrying on some study.  Morris seems to know him a little, and tells  me that he has visited him two or three times at his apartments.  I  questioned him as to who the man was, and his antecedents, which seemed  to be satisfactory.  I did so after his presenting his letter of  introduction and some testimonials.  I thought that it would be only  civil to ask him to dinner and explain to him that it was perfectly  hopeless for him to expect anything from me; and, in short, one feels a  little sympathetic towards a cultivated gentleman who is seeking to  obtain an appointment in a none-too-well-paid profession.  So now you  see, my dear Mr Rampson, that you have not the slightest cause for  uneasiness.\"    \"Dr Bewley,\" cried Rampson excitedly, \"you don't know how you have  relieved my mind!\"    \"I am very glad, Rampson; and let me take this opportunity of telling  you that--Bless my heart! what is the meaning of this?\"    \"Of what, sir?\" cried Rampson, startled by the speaker's earnestness.    \"Look over yonder beyond the elms.  Scandalous!  Disgraceful!  And after  all that I have said!  I will not have it, Rampson.\"    \"But, sir, I--\"    \"Don't you see that there's a fight going on?  Just as if it were a  common school.  Come with me at once.\"    The Doctor set aside his stately march and hurried out through the open  window, bare-headed, and closely followed by his assistant.    There, through the elms and close up to the grey park-fence beyond, the  whole school seemed to have assembled, and plainly enough at intervals  there was the quick movement of two contending figures, while the  clustering boys around heaved and swayed as they watched the encounter,  quite forgetful in their excitement of the possibility of their being  seen from the house.    Dr Bewley did not run, but went nearer to it than he had been since he  wrote DD at the end of his name and gave up cricket; while before they  were half-way across the cricket-field Mr Rampson was emitting puffs  suggesting that the motive-power by which he moved was connected with a  modern utilisation of steam.    So intent was the little scholastic crowd beyond the row of tree-trunks  which with the park-palings beyond formed the arena, that not a head was  turned to see the"]]]
