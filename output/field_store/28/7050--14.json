The  making of this canal, which was about a mile and a half long employed a  number of men for three years.    In the spring of B.C. 480 Xerxes set out from Sardis with his vast  host.  Upon reaching Abydos on the Hellespont the army crossed over to  Europe by the bridge of boats.  Xerxes surveyed the scene from a marble  throne.  His heart swelled within him at the sight of such a vast  assemblage of human beings; but his feelings of pride and pleasure soon  gave way to sadness, and he burst into tears at the reflection that in  a hundred years not one of them would be alive.  Xerxes continued his  march through Europe along the coast of Thrace.  Upon arriving at the  spacious plain of Doriscus, which is traversed by the river Hebrus, he  resolved to number his forces.  He found that the whole armament, both  military and naval, consisted of 2,317,610 men.  In his march from  Doriscus to Thermopylae he received a still further accession of  strength; and accordingly when he reached Thermopylae the land and sea  forces amounted to 2,641,610 fighting men.  The attendants are said to  have been more in number than the fighting men; but if they were only  equal, the number of persons who accompanied Xerxes to Thermopylae  reaches the astounding figure of 5,283,220!  The number is quite  incredible; but though the exact number of the invading army cannot be  determined, we may safely conclude, from all the circumstances of the  case, that it was the largest ever assembled at any period of history.    From Doriscus Xerxes his march along the coast through Thrace and  Macedonia.  The principal cities through which he passed had to furnish  a day's meal for the immense host, and for this purpose had made  preparations many months before-hand.  The cost of feeding such a  multitude brought many cities to the brink of ruin.  At Acanthus his  fleet sailed through the isthmus of Athos and after doubling the  promontories of Sithonia and Pallene joined him at the city of Therma,  better known by its later name of Thessalonica.  Thence he continued  his march through the southern part of Macedonia and Thessaly, meeting  with no opposition till he reached the celebrated pass of Thermopylae.    The mighty preparations of Xerxes had been no secret in Greece; and  during the preceding winter a congress of the Grecian states had been  summoned by the Spartans and Athenians to meet at the isthmus of  Corinth.  But so great was the terror inspired by the countless hosts  of Xerxes that many of the Grecian states at once tendered their  submission to him, and others refused to take any part in the congress.  The only people, north of the isthmus of Corinth, who remained faithful  to the cause of Grecian liberty, were the Athenians and Phocians, and  the inhabitants of the small Boeotian towns of Plataea and Thespiae.  The other people in northern Greece were either partisans of the  Persians, like the Thebans, or were unwilling to make any great  sacrifices for the preservation of their independence.  In  Peloponnesus, the powerful city of Argos and the Achaeans stood aloof.  From the more distant members of the Hellenic race no assistance was  obtained.  Gelon, the ruler of Syracuse, offered to send a powerful  armament, provided the command of the allied forces was intrusted to  him; but the envoys did not venture to accept a proposal which would  have placed both Sparta and Athens under the control of a Sicilian  tyrant.    The desertion of the cause of Grecian independence by so many of the  Greeks did not shake the resolution of Sparta and of Athens. The  Athenians, especially, set a noble example of an enlarged patriotism.  They became reconciled to the AEginetans, and thus gained for the  common cause the powerful navy of their rival. They readily granted to  the Spartans the supreme command of the forces by sea as well as by  land, although they furnished two-thirds of the vessels of the entire  fleet.  Their illustrious citizen Themistocles was the soul of the  congress.  He sought to enkindle in the other Greeks some portion of  the ardour and energy which he had succeeded in breathing into the  Athenians.    The Greeks determined to make a stand at the pass of Thermopylae, which  forms the entrance from northern into southern Greece. This pass lies  between Mount OEta and the sea.  It is about a mile in length.  At each  of its extremities the mountains approach so near the sea as to leave  barely room for the passage of a single carriage.  The northern, or, to  speak more properly, the western Gate, was close to the town of  Anthela, where the Amphictyonic council held its autumnal meetings;  while the southern, or the eastern Gate, was near the Locrian town of  Alpeni.  These narrow entrances were called Pylae, or the Gates. The  space between the gates was wider and more open, and was distinguished  by its hot springs, from which the pass derived the name of  Thermopylae, or the \"Hot-Gates.\"  The island of Euboea is here  separated from the mainland by a narrow strait, which in one part is  only two miles and a half in breadth; and accordingly it is easy, by  defending this part of the sea with a fleet, to prevent an enemy from  landing troops at the southern end of the pass.    The Grecian fleet, under the command of the Spartan Eurybiades, took up  its station off that portion of the northern coast of Euboea which  faces Magnesia and the entrance to the Thessalian gulf and which was  called Artemisium, from a neighbouring temple of Artemis (Diana).  It  was, however, only a small land-force that was sent to the defence of  Thermopylae.  When the arrival of Xerxes at Therma became known, the  Greeks were upon the point of celebrating the Olympic games, and the  festival of the Carnean Apollo, which was observed with great solemnity  at Sparta and in other Doric states.  The Peloponnesians therefore sent  forward only 300 Spartans and 3000 hoplites from other Peloponnesian  states, under the command of the Spartan king Leonidas, a force which  they thought would be sufficient to maintain the pass till the  festivals were over.  In his march northwards Leonidas received  additions from the Thespians, Phocians, and Locrians, so that he had  under his command at Thermopylae about 7000 men.    Meanwhile Xerxes had arrived within sight of Thermopylae.  He had heard  that a handful of desperate men, commanded by a Spartan, had determined  to dispute his passage, but he refused to believe the news.  He was  still more astonished when a horseman, whom he had sent to reconnoitre,  brought back word that he had seen several Spartans outside the wall in  front of the pass, some amusing themselves with gymnastic exercises,  and others combing their long hair.  In great perplexity, he sent for  the exiled Spartan king Demaratus, who had accompanied him from Persia,  and asked him the meaning of such madness.  Demaratus replied, that the  Spartans would defend the pass to the death, and that it was their  practice to dress their heads with peculiar care when they were going  to battle.  Later writers relate that Xerxes sent to them to deliver up  their arms.  Leonidas desired him \"to come and take them.\"  One of the  Spartans being told that \"the Persian host was so prodigious that their  arrows would conceal the sun:\"--\"So much the better\" (he replied), \"we  shall then fight in the shade.\"    At length, upon the fifth day, Xerxes ordered a chosen body of Medes to  advance against the presumptuous foes and bring them into his presence.  But their superior numbers were of no avail in such a narrow space, and  they were kept at bay by the long spears and steady ranks of the  Greeks.  After the combat had lasted a long time with heavy loss to the  Medes, Xerxes ordered his ten thousand \"Immortals,\" the flower of the  Persian army, to advance.  But they were as unsuccessful as the Medes.  Xerxes beheld the repulse of his troops from a lofty throne which had  been provided for him, and was seen to leap thrice from his seat in an  agony of fear or rage.    On the following day the attack was renewed, but with no better  success:  and Xerxes was beginning to despair of forcing his way  through the pass, when a Malian, of the name of Ephialtes, betrayed to  the Persian king that there was an unfrequented path across Mount OEta,  ascending on the northern side of the mountain and descending on the  southern side near the termination of the pass.  Overjoyed at this  discovery, a strong detachment of Persians was ordered to follow the  traitor.  Meantime Leonidas and his troops had received ample notice of  the impending danger. During the night deserters from the enemy had  brought him the news; and their intelligence was confirmed by his own  scouts on the hills.  His resolution was at once taken.  As a Spartan  he was bound to conquer or to die in the post assigned to him; and he  was the more ready to sacrifice his life, since an oracle had declared  that either Sparta itself or a Spartan king must perish by the Persian  arms.  His three hundred comrades were fully equal to the same heroism  which actuated their King; and the seven hundred Thespians resolved to  share the fate of this gallant band.  He allowed the rest of the allies  to retire, with the exception of four hundred Boeotians, whom he  retained as hostages.  Xerxes delayed his attack till the middle of the  day, when it was expected that the detachment sent across the mountain  would arrive at the rear of the pass.  But Leonidas and his comrades,  only anxious to sell their lives as dearly as possible, did not wait to  receive the attack of the Persians, but advanced into the open space in  front of the pass, and charged the enemy with desperate valour.  Numbers of the Persians were slain; many were driven into the  neighbouring sea; and others again were trampled to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],[0,"A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#14)"],[1," interior of this beautiful building is  grand and imposing in the extreme; its roof, which is composed of the  elaborate fan vaulting, for which the Perpendicular style is so famous,  rises from slender shafts, and is ornamented with large and handsome  bosses, upon each of which is carved a shield, with armorial bearings.  In these respects, as well as in the general aspect of its details,  this building so nearly resembles the noble chapel of King's College,  Cambridge, as to warrant the supposition that they were both erected  from the designs of one architect. The New Building is lighted by  thirteen very fine windows, two of which are filled with modern painted  glass. The space below the windows is occupied by a rich cornice, an  elegant arcade, and a stone seat. Here is to be seen a monument, till  lately supposed to be that of abbot Hedda and his monks, whose massacre  by the Danes was spoken of in the first chapter of this work, which is  considered to be one of the oldest christian monuments now extant in  England.\" See note on page 4.    At the south end of this building, are the remains of a beautiful  marble monument, erected by Sir Humphrey Orme, the destruction of which  is recorded at page 34 of this work.    By the side of this monument are two tablets, one in memory of  _Archdeacon Davys_, his wife _Selina_, and their son _John William  Owen_; underneath which is a black tablet, surmounted by a shield,  bearing a coat of arms, with a mitre, in memory of _Francis Jeune,  D.C.L._, twenty-fifth bishop of Peterborough, who died in 1868.    On the south-east side of the altar, is a very stately and handsome  marble monument of the Corinthian order; on which is a portraiture of  the gentleman for whom it was erected, lying on his left side, and  leaning on a cushion, with his hand upon a scull; above which statue is  this inscription--        \"Sacred to the memory of _Thomas Deacon_, Esq., a native of this      city; sometime high sheriff of this county: a person eminent for      his morality and good life; a true son of the established church: a      constant attendant on her worship and service: his piety consisted      not in empty profession, but in sincerity and unaffected truth. He      had an ample estate, which he fairly acquired, and increased by an      honest industry, and managed with excellent prudence, and disposed      of to laudable purposes. His charity (even in the time of his life)      was very large, extensive, and exemplary; of which he has left a      lasting monument in this city, by founding a charity school, and      endowing it with a freehold estate, of above one hundred and sixty      pounds per annum: And also, by settling another estate of      twenty-five pounds per annum, for a constant annual distribution of      alms to poor ancient inhabitants of this city. Having thus laid up      in store to himself a good foundation against the time to come, he      quietly departed this life, on the 19th day of August, 1721, aged      70 years.        \"To whose memory as an instance of her conjugal affection, Mary,      his sorrowful relict, caused this monument to be erected.\"    Beneath his effigy, and upon the front of the tomb, is the following  inscription--        \"In memory of _Mary_, the relict of Thomas Deacon, Esq.; daughter      of John Harvey, of Spalding, gent. To which place she was a kind      generous benefactor, and bestowed upwards of L400 in pious and      useful charities. She gave also to Fleet L250, for founding a      charity school in that parish. To the poor of this city, she      extended her daily bounty, so private as not to be told; so large      as not to be equalled; to which she added several public      benefactions, and gave towards augmenting the vicarage of St. John      Baptist L100; and likewise L100 to the salary of the grammar      school; she died January 27th, 1730, aged 77 years.\"    In a recess adjoining this monument, is a neat tablet to the memory of  _Mary_, the mother of the Rev. J. S. Pratt, formerly a prebendary of  this cathedral, and vicar of the parish of St. John the Baptist,  Peterborough.    Underneath this, a handsome tablet to the late _William Strong_, D.D.,  forty-five years archdeacon of this diocese, and for nearly half a  century a magistrate for the Liberty of Peterborough.    Near the last monument, behind the altar screen, are interred the  remains of six bishops, viz.:--_Cumberland_, _Kennett_, _Hinchcliffe_,  _Madan_, _Marsh and Davys_; tablets to the four latter, are in the  recess opposite the large painted window.    Beneath these, is an effigy, supposed to be that of _Abbot William de  Hotot_, who died in 1250.    On the north-east side of the altar, is a very handsome marble monument  to _Bishop Cumberland_, great grandfather to the celebrated dramatist  of that name.    Beneath this, is a neat tablet to _Joseph Parsons_, formerly a  prebendary of this cathedral, and _Letitia_, his wife; near which, is a  monument erected to his intimate friend _William Tournay_, D.D., also a  prebendary of this cathedral, and of St. Peter's, Westminster, and for  twenty-five years warden of Wadham College, Oxford, &c.    Adjoining, are the remains of an ancient shrine, supposed to be that of  _St. Ibba_.    Above this is a marble tablet to _Louisa Cole_, of the Vineyard.    On leaving the Lady Chapel, in the north aisle of the choir, is a  splendid monument to _Richard Trice_, beneath which is a handsome  double _piscina_.    Opposite to this, a small marble monument to _Frances_, wife of _Dean  Cosin_, who died March 25th, 1642; above which is an epitaph to  _Dorothy_, the wife of _Francis Standish_, formerly precentor of this  cathedral, who died in 1689.    Opposite, is another plain black marble slab, similar to that in the  south aisle, with a small brass inscription which marks the grave of  _Catherine of Arragon_.    On the north wall of the side aisle is a monument by the celebrated  Gibbons, with the following inscription--        \"Sacred to the memory of _Constance_, daughter of _John May_, of      Rawmeare, in Sussex, Esquire; and of _Constance_, his wife, one of      the daughters and co-heiress of _Thomas Panton_, of Westminster,      knight and baronet, and wife of _John Workman_, prebendary of this      church, who, having by all christian virtues and good qualities,      been an ornament to her worthy family, and an honour to all her      relations in her life, resigned up her soul to God with admirable      patience at her death; she deceased in childbed at London; and,      together with her infant son, she was according to her desire, here      interred, where she had frequently worshipped God, in hope of a      joyful resurrection, September 30th, A.D. 1681.\"    Next, is a tablet to _James Duport_, formerly dean of this cathedral,  chaplain to Charles II., and professor of Greek at Trinity College,  Cambridge.    Adjoining, is another tablet to the memory of the _Rev. John Workman_,  M.A., formerly a prebendary of this cathedral, and rector of Peakirk,  &c.    Next, is a tablet to _William Rowles_, of Washingley, and _Ann  Wilkinson_, his daughter.    The next is to the _Rev. William Gery_, also a prebendary of this  cathedral, and Susannah, his wife, who lived together 47 years. This is  a very handsome tablet.    The last is a handsome tablet to the _Rev. William Waring_, A.M.,  formerly master of the grammar school, who died 1726, aged 66.    In a small chapel, known as the Morning Chapel, dedicated to St. John  and St. James, is some _ancient tapestry_; one piece representing St.  Peter and St. John healing the lame man at the beautiful gate of the  temple; the other representing St. Peter's deliverance from prison. In  the north-east corner is a tablet to the _Rev. John Stevens_, A.M.,  rector of Folksworth, Hunts.; and in the centre of the east wall is a  stained glass window, representing four scenes from the life of our  Lord. Here also are the remains of the woodwork of the _old choir_,  which have been converted into seats, and will serve to show to the  curious its former character and style.      The Organ,    Which is placed above the screen, dividing the nave from the choir, is  a very fine toned instrument, and was built in 1809, by the late Mr.  Allen, of Sutton Street, Soho. It has within the last few years been  much improved and enlarged. It contains forty-eight stops,  viz.:--twelve in the great organ, twelve in the swell, ten in the  choir, eight in the pedal organ, and six couplers. These improvements  were made by H. P. Gates, Esq., of the Vineyard, and are commemorated  by a brass plate on the south side of the organ, inscribed as follows:  \"To the praise and glory of God and memory of John and Frances Gates,  this organ was re-built and enlarged at the charge of Henry Pearson  Gates, their son, Anno Domini 1871.\" The case of the instrument, which  is of carved oak, presents towards the nave, a front in the early  English style, while on the side looking into the choir, the fronts are  decorated, to harmonize with the interior fittings.      The Choir.    As we enter the choir, the bishop's throne, with the stalls, pulpit,  pews, and altar screen burst upon us, all of which are beautifully  carved. The altar screen is composed of a soft white stone, found near  Cambridge; the rest that we have mentioned, is oak, very finely carved  in the decorated style of architecture. The bishop's throne especially,  with its ogee canopies, and elegant and almost fairy-like spire, rivets  the eye of the spectator. The _coup d'oeil_ of the choir is so  strikingly beautiful, from the good arrangement and entire keeping of  the whole, that it can scarcely be surpassed.    At the east end, immediately under the large window, are three tablets  with the names of all the Abbots, Bishops, and Deans from the  foundation of the monastery to the present time, of which the following  is a copy:--   "]]]
