They perplexed him as a politician intent upon order, and they afflicted  him sorely as an ardent disciple of the Savoyard Vicar. Hebert, however,  was so strong that it needed some courage to attack him, nor did  Robespierre dare to withstand him to the face. But he did not flinch  from making an energetic assault upon atheism and the excesses of its  partisans. His admirers usually count his speech of the Twenty-first of  November one of the most admirable of his oratorical successes. The  Sphinx still sits inexorable at our gates, and his words have lost none  of their interest. 'Every philosopher and every individual,' he said,  'may adopt whatever opinion he pleases about atheism. Any one who wishes  to make such an opinion into a crime is an insensate; but the public man  or the legislator who should adopt such a system, would be a hundred  times more insensate still. The National Convention abhors it. The  Convention is not the author of a scheme of metaphysics. It was not to  no purpose that it published the Declaration of the Rights of Man in  presence of the Supreme Being. I shall be told perhaps that I have a  narrow intelligence, that I am a man of prejudice, and a fanatic. I  have already said that I spoke neither as an individual nor as a  philosopher with a system, but as a representative of the people.  _Atheism is aristocratic. The idea of a great being who watches over  oppressed innocence and punishes triumphant crime is essentially the  idea of the people._ This is the sentiment of Europe and the Universe;  it is the sentiment of the French nation. That people is attached  neither to priests, nor to superstition, nor to ceremonies; it is  attached only to worship in itself, or in other words to the idea of an  incomprehensible Power, the terror of wrongdoers, the stay and comfort  of virtue, to which it delights to render words of homage that are all  so many anathemas against injustice and triumphant crime.'    This is Robespierre's favourite attitude, the priest posing as  statesman. Like others, he declares the Supreme Power incomprehensible,  and then describes him in terms of familiar comprehension. He first  declares atheism an open choice, and then he brands it with the most  odious epithet in the accepted vocabulary of the hour. Danton followed  practically the same line, though saying much less about it. 'If  Greece,' he said in the Convention, 'had its Olympian games, France too  shall solemnise her sans-culottid days. The people will have high  festivals; they will offer incense to the Supreme Being, to the master  of nature; for we never intended to annihilate the reign of superstition  in order to set up the reign of atheism.... If we have not honoured the  priest of error and fanaticism, neither do we wish to honour the priest  of incredulity: we wish to serve the people. I demand that there shall  be an end of these anti-religious masquerades in the Convention.'    There was an end of the masquerading, but the Hebertists still kept  their ground. Danton, Robespierre, and the Committee were all equally  impotent against them for some months longer. The revolutionary force  had been too strong to be resisted by any government since the Paris  insurgents had carried both King and Assembly in triumph from Versailles  in the October of 1789. It was now too strong for those who had begun to  strive with all their might to build a new government out of the  agencies that had shattered the old to pieces. For some months the  battle which had been opened by Robespierre's remonstrance against  atheistic intolerance, degenerated into a series of masked skirmishes.  The battle-ground of rival principles was overshadowed by the baleful  wings of the genius of demonic Hate. _Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni_;  the banners of the King of the Pit came forth. The scene at the  Cordeliers for a time became as frantic as a Council of the Early Church  settling the true composition of the Holy Trinity. Or it recalls the  fierce and bloody contentions between Demos and Oligarchy in an old  Greek town. We think of the day in the harbour of Corcyra when the  Athenian admiral who had come to deliver the people, sailed out to meet  the Spartan enemy, and on turning round to see if his Corcyrean allies  were following, saw them following indeed, but the crew of every ship  striving in enraged conflict with one another. Collot D'Herbois had come  back in hot haste from Lyons, where, along with Fouche, he had done his  best to carry out the decree of the Convention, that not one stone of  the city should be left on the top of another, and that even its very  name should cease from the lips of men. Carrier was recalled from  Nantes, where his feats of ingenious massacre had rivalled the exploits  of the cruellest and maddest of the Roman Emperors. The presence of  these men of blood gave new courage and resolution to the Hebertists.  Though the alliance was informal, yet as against Danton, Camille  Desmoulins, and the rest of the Indulgents, as well as against  Robespierre, they made common cause.    Camille Desmoulins attacked Hebert in successive numbers of a journal  that is perhaps the one truly literary monument of this stage of the  revolution. Hebert retaliated by impugning the patriotism of Desmoulins  in the Club, and the unfortunate wit, notwithstanding the efforts of  Robespierre on his behalf, was for a while turned out of the sacred  precincts. The power of the extreme faction was shown in relation to  other prominent members of the party whom they loved to stigmatise by  the deadly names of Indulgent and Moderantist. Even Danton himself was  attacked (December 1793), and the integrity of his patriotism brought  into question. Robespierre made an energetic defence of his great rival  in the hierarchy of revolution, and the defence saved Danton from the  mortal ignominy of expulsion from the communion of the orthodox. On the  other hand, Anacharsis Clootz, that guileless ally of the party of  delirium, was less fortunate. Robespierre assailed the cosmopolitan for  being a German baron, for having four thousand pounds a year, and for  striking his sans-culottism some notes higher than the regular pitch.  Even M. Louis Blanc calls this an iniquity, and sets it down as the  worst page in Robespierre's life. Others have described Robespierre as  struck at this time by the dire malady of kings--hatred of the Idea. It  seems, however, a hard saying that devotion to the Idea is to extinguish  common sense. Clootz, notwithstanding his simple and disinterested  character, and his possession of some rays of the modern illumination,  was one of the least sane of all the men who in the exultation of their  silly gladness were suddenly caught up by that great wheel of fire. All  we can say is that Robespierre's bitter demeanour towards Clootz was  ungenerous; but then this is only natural in him. Robespierre often  clothed cool policy in the semblance of clemency, but I cannot hear in  any phrase he ever used, or see in any measure he ever proposed, the  mark of true generosity; of kingliness of spirit, not a trace. He had no  element of ready and cordial propitiation, an element that can never be  wanting in the greatest leaders in time of storm. If he resisted the  atrocious proposals to put Madame Elizabeth to death, he was thinking  not of mercy or justice, but of the mischievous effect that her  execution would have upon the public opinion of Europe, and he was so  unmanly as to speak of her as _la meprisable soeur de Louis XVI_. Such  a phrase is the disclosure of an abject stratum in his soul.    Yet this did not prevent him from seeing and denouncing the bloody  extravagances of the Proconsuls, the representatives of Parisian  authority in the provinces; nor from standing firm against the execution  of the Seventy-Three, who had been bold enough to question the purgation  of the National Convention on the Thirty-first of May. But the return of  Collot d'Herbois made the situation more intricate. Collot was by his  position the ally of Billaud, and to attack him, therefore, was to  attack the most powerful member of the Committee of Public Safety.  Billaud was too formidable. He was always the impersonation of the ruder  genius of the Revolution, and the incarnation of the philosophy of the  Terror, not as a delirium, but as a piece of deliberate policy. His  pale, sober, and concentrated physiognomy seemed a perpetual menace. He  had no gifts of speech, but his silence made people shudder, like the  silence of the thunder when the tempest rages at its height. It was said  by contemporaries that if Vadier was a hyaena, Barere a jackal, and  Robespierre a cat, Billaud was a tiger.    The cat perceived that he was in danger of not having the tiger, jackal,  and hyaena, on his side. Robespierre, in whom spasmodical courage and  timidity ruled by rapid turns, began to suspect that he had been  premature; and a convenient illness, which some suppose to have been  feigned, excused his withdrawal for some weeks from a scene where he  felt that he could no longer see clear. We cannot doubt that both he and  Danton were perfectly assured that the anarchic party must unavoidably  roll headlong into the abyss. But the hour of doom was uncertain. To  make a mistake in the right moment, to hurry the crisis, was instant  death. Robespierre was a more adroit calculator than Danton. We must not  confound his thin and querulous reserve with that stout and deep-browed  patience, which may imply as superb a fortitude, and may demand as much  iron control in a statesman, as the most heroic exploits of political  energy. But his habit of waiting on force, instead of, like the other,  taking the initiative with force, had trained his sight. The mixture of  astuteness with his scruple, of egoistic policy with his stiffness for  doctrine, gave him an advantage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#14)"],[1,"imb, he thought he would go and ask for something to eat and drink.    He had not gone very far before he met a fairy, who told him that the  castle belonged to a wicked ogre, who had killed and eaten a great  number of people.    [Illustration]    \"It was he who killed your father,\" she said. \"And it is your duty to do  your utmost to destroy the wicked monster. Go now, and see what you can  do. If you can carry off any of his treasures you are at liberty to do  so--for none of them really belongs to him. He has taken them all by  force from the people whom he has robbed and killed.\"    Jack was delighted at the idea of this adventure, and set off in high  spirits towards the castle.    The castle was farther off than he had thought, and by the time he  reached the gates, it was so late that he made up his mind to ask  for a night's lodging. There was a woman standing in the doorway;  but when Jack made his request, she was very frightened, and said--    \"Indeed, I dare not take you in and give you food and lodging. My  husband is an ogre who lives on human flesh. If he were to find you  here, he would think nothing of eating you up in three mouthfuls. I  advise you to go away at once, before he comes home.\"    But when she saw how tired and hungry Jack really was, she took him into  the house and gave him plenty to eat and drink. While Jack was eating  his food in the kitchen there came a loud knocking at the door. The  ogre's wife, in a great flurry, hid Jack in the oven, and then hurried  to let her husband in. Jack peeped through the oven door, and saw a  terrible-looking ogre, who came stamping into the kitchen, and said in  a voice like thunder--    \"Wife, I smell fresh meat!\"    \"It is only the people you are fattening in the dungeon,\" said the wife.    So the ogre sat down and ate his supper. After supper, he commanded his  wife to bring him his money-bags. He then began to count his  money--thousands and thousands of pieces of gold and silver.    [Illustration]    Jack wished he could take some of this money home to his mother; and,  presently, when the ogre fell asleep, he crept out of his hiding-place,  and hoisting the bags upon his shoulder, slipped quietly away with them.  The ogre was snoring so loudly that it sounded like the wind in the  chimney on a stormy night. So he never heard the little noise Jack  made, and Jack got safely away and escaped down the beanstalk.    His mother was overjoyed to see him, for she had been very anxious about  him when he did not come home the night before; and she was delighted  with the bags of money, which were enough to keep them in comfort and  luxury for some time.    For many months Jack and his mother lived happily together; but after a  while the money came to an end, and Jack made up his mind to climb the  beanstalk again, and carry off some more of the ogre's treasures. So one  morning he got up early, put on a different suit of clothes, so that the  ogre's wife should not recognize him, and set out to climb the  beanstalk.    [Illustration: _Jack and the Beanstalk_  Down Came the Beanstalk, Down Came the Ogre]    And he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he  climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed--until at last he climbed to the  very top and found himself in the ogre's country again.    When he reached the castle the ogre's wife was again standing in the  doorway. But when Jack asked for a night's lodging, she said she dared  not give him one, for only a few months before she had taken in a poor  boy who seemed half dead with fatigue and hunger, and in return for her  kindness, he had stolen some of her husband's money and run away in the  night.    But Jack begged so hard that at last she relented. She gave him a good  supper and hid him in a closet before her husband came home.    Presently there was a great noise outside and heavy footsteps that shook  the castle to its foundations. It was the ogre come home. As soon as he  entered the kitchen, he sniffed suspiciously, and said:    \"I smell fresh meat!\"    \"It is only the crows on the housetops,\" said his wife. \"They have  brought home a piece of carrion for their young.\"    After supper, the ogre told his wife to fetch his hen. This hen was a  very wonderful bird. Whenever the ogre said \"Lay\" she laid an egg of  solid gold. Jack thought that if he could only get this wonderful hen  to take home to his mother, they would never want any more. So when  the ogre fell asleep--as he did after a little while--he came out of  the closet, and, seizing the hen in his arms, made off with her. The  hen squawked, but the ogre's snoring was like the roaring of the sea  when the tide is coming in, and Jack got safely down the beanstalk.    The hen laid so many golden eggs that Jack and his mother became quite  rich and prosperous; and there was really no need for Jack to go again  to the ogre's country. But he liked the danger and excitement, and he  remembered that the fairy had told him to take as many of the ogre's  treasures as he could; and at last, without saying a word to anybody,  he started off once more to climb the magic beanstalk.    And he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he  climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed--until at last he reached the  very tiptop, and stood in the ogre's country.    This time when he reached the castle he began to be afraid that the  ogre's wife really would not let him in.    \"Indeed and indeed, I dare not,\" she said. \"Twice lately have I  given shelter to a wayfaring youth, and each time he stole some of  my husband's treasures, and made off with them. Now my husband has  forbidden me, on pain of instant death, to give food or lodging  to any traveler.\"    But Jack pleaded and pleaded, and at last the good-natured woman, moved  to pity by his travel-stained appearance, gave way and let him into the  castle.    [Illustration]    When the ogre came home, the wife hid Jack in the copper. As usual, the  ogre's first words were:    \"Wife, wife, I smell fresh meat!\" And, in spite of all his wife could  say, he insisted upon searching all round the room. Jack was in a  terrible fright whilst he was hunting: but fortunately, he forgot to  look in the copper, and after a time he sat down to his supper.    When supper was over, the ogre told his wife to fetch his harp. Jack  peeped out of the copper and saw the harp brought in and set down  before the ogre. It was marvelously made; and when the ogre said \"Play!\"  it played the finest music without being touched. Jack was enchanted,  for he had never before heard such wonderful music, and he felt that he  must have the harp for his own.    The ogre was soon lulled to sleep by the sweet sound of the harp; and  when he was snoring heavily, Jack crept out of the copper, and taking up  the harp was about to make off with it. But the harp was a fairy harp,  and it called out loudly: \"Master, master, master;\" and, although the  ogre was snoring so noisily that it was like the sound of a hundred  dragons roaring at once, yet to Jack's dismay and horror he heard the  voice of his harp, and, starting to his feet with a bellow of anger,  rushed after the daring thief.    Jack ran faster than he had ever run in his life before--still carrying  the precious harp--while the ogre ran after him, shouting and roaring  and making such a noise that it sounded like a thousand thunder storms  all going at once. If he had not drunk so much wine for supper, the ogre  must very soon have caught Jack; but as it was, the wine had got into  his head, and so he could not run nearly so fast as usual, and Jack  reached the beanstalk just in front of him.    It was a very close shave. Jack slid down the beanstalk at his top  speed, calling at the top of his voice for his mother to fetch him an  axe. The ogre came tumbling down the beanstalk after him; but Jack  seized the axe and chopped the beanstalk off close to the root. Down  came the beanstalk, down came the ogre, and falling headlong into the  garden he was killed on the spot.    After this, Jack quite gave up his lazy, idle ways, and he and his  mother, with the magic hen and the wonderful harp, lived in happiness  and prosperity the rest of their lives.    [Illustration]          DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT    [Illustration]      In the reign of King Edward the Third there was a poor orphan boy, named  Dick Whittington, living in a country village a long way from London. He  was a sharp little lad, and the stories that he heard of London being  paved with gold made him long to visit that city.    One day, a large wagon and eight horses, with bells at their heads,  drove through the village. Dick thought it must be going to London, so  he asked the driver to let him walk by the side of the wagon. As soon as  the driver heard that poor Dick had neither father nor mother, and saw  by his ragged clothes that he could not be worse off than he was, he  told him he might go if he would; so they set off together.    Dick got safely to London, and was in such a hurry to see the fine  streets paved with gold, that he ran through many of them, thinking  every moment to come to those that were paved with gold; for Dick had  seen a guinea three times in his own little village, and remembered what  a lot of money it brought in change; so he thought he had nothing to do  but to take up some little bits of pavement, and he would then have as  much money as he could wish for. Poor Dick ran till he was tired, and  had quite forgotten his friend the driver. At last, finding it grow  dark, and that every way he turned he saw nothing but dirt instead of  gold, he sat down in a dark corner, and cried himself to sleep. Next  morning, being very hungry, he got up and walked about, and asked  everybody he met to give him a halfpenny to keep him from starving.  At last, a good-natured-looking gentleman saw how hungry he looked.    \"Why don't you go to work, my lad?\""]]]
