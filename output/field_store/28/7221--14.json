A proof of what I advance may be known as regards the chevalier or  chevaliere d'Eon, I know not which. But these secret agents were,  unknown to the king, all devoted to the parliaments, and consequently  inimical to courtiers, favorites, and especially mistresses. God knows  how they disposed of us! By these unpropitious channels the king had  learnt all the hatred which was borne to madame de Pompadour. He was  afraid of exciting the discontent of the people by announcing another  mistress, and was no less intimidated at the severity of madame Louise,  and the ill-humor of his other children. He loved his pleasure much, but  his ease more.    Comte Jean, who was restrained by no considerations, advised me to  overleap all difficulty, by asking the king myself for the favor which  I coveted. His advice seemed rational, and I was besides urged on to do  so. Each day brought to me impertinences said of me by the noble ladies  of the chateau. I learnt that they boasted that I should never set foot  in the great apartments, but should remain the obscure mistress of the  king. This made me impatient, and by degrees deprived me of my natural  gaiety.    One day when the king was with me, he perceived my want of spirits.    \"What ails you?\" said be, with the greatest solicitude.    \"What ails me!\" replied I, \"I wish I were dead, rather than see myself  the butt of all the scandal of the foul-mouthed gossips of your court.\"    The king, suspecting the confidence I was about to repose in him, was  sorry he had asked for it, and was silent. He began to play a tattoo  with his fingers on the chimney-piece. At this moment mademoiselle Chon  came in. The king, delighted at seeing her, instantly inquired into her  state of health. She, after a profound reverence, said,    \"Sire, how can I be well when there is trouble in my family?\"    \"Ah, _bon Dieu_! what is this?\" said he, turning to me.    \"I am insulted, hooted: they say that I have the misfortune to be no  longer in the good graces of your majesty.\"    \"Ah, tell them they lie in their throats,\" replied the king, kissing me  on the forehead; \"you are the woman of my heart, and she whom I would  fain load with honors.\"    \"Your majesty speaks to me,\" I answered, \"with great condescension [my  sister-in-law left the room that she might not spoil the explanation],  but yet you are the cause of the insolences which I am subjected to from  the vile crew.\"    \"What is the matter with you to-day? In truth you are a perfect little  devil.\"    \"I wish I were, that I might punish evil tongues, since there is no king  of France to avenge me.\"    \"You are severe, madame,\" replied Louis XV, turning his imposing and  handsome face towards me, and to which he vainly endeavored to give an  air of anger. I saw my success, and added,    \"Yes, sire, it is insupportable for me to think that I am supposed not  to possess your friendship, and that I only play the part of a temporary  friend. It makes me wretched: you must not be angry if I complain of you  to your royal self.\"    \"Well, well, you madcap, what must I do? Whom must I banish?\"    \"Oh, sire, no one: with your august support I fear no person; nothing  but appearances.\"    \"You are an excellent creature; in your place madame de Pompadour would  have imprisoned half France.\"    \"That was because she loved revenge better than she loved your majesty.  As for me, I should be miserable if I were the cause of one single  family complaining against you.\"    The king, delighted at these words, which really came from my heart,  embraced me tenderly two or three times, and said,    \"I wish your enemies could understand you, for they would soon be at  your knees. But if we imprison or exile no person, how shall we strike  terror into them?\"    \"It is not terror but envy that I would excite. Let me be presented at  court, and all my wishes will be satisfied.\"    \"I cannot for the life of me divine why you should lay so much stress  on coming to weary yourself with the ceremonies of myself and daughters.  Heaven preserve you from all the irksomeness of court ceremony!\" And  Louis XV sighed. \"Did you ever think,\" he added, \"of all the vanities,  all the interests I have to manage; all the intrigues that are  perpetually agitating, and all the opposition made to me? The court,  the city, the people, will rise against me: they will clamor,  groan, complain; verse, prose, epigram, and pamphlet will appear in  uninterrupted succession. You would be first attacked, and hatred will  perhaps extend to me. I shall see again the times when the Damiens,  in the name of the parliaments, as one party says, in the name of the  Jesuits, as the other party says, and, what is more true, in the name--\"    The king suddenly paused; a deep shade of melancholy settled on his  features, his noble head dropped on his bosom. Louis XV remained for  some time motionless; at length,    \"Well,\" he exclaimed, attempting to force a smile, \"well! I will write  to the ladies de Grammont, to inform them that they need not give  themselves the trouble to remain near me at the chateau.\"    On his saying these words I darted towards the door, and went into my  chamber. The king followed, and finding there mademoiselle Chon, who was  working at some tapestry, said to her,    \"Mademoiselle, I confide to your care, and by oral _lettre de cachet_,  the most amiable little devil in France. And now, mademoiselle du Barry,  having nothing further to add, I pray God to take you to His powerful  and holy keeping.\"    After this pleasantry the king, delighted at the gay termination of  a somewhat serious scene, went, or rather vanished; for to use a  proverbial expression, he ran like a thief.    As soon as I was alone with my sister-in-law, I told her all that had  passed.    \"I see,\" said she, \"that the king is fearful of offending the duc de  Choiseul, and giving annoyance to his daughters. But a step must  be determined on which will place you out of the reach of complete  disgrace. Would it not be best to get some nobleman, who can do so with  influence, to speak to him on the subject? If the duc de Richelieu were  here--\"    \"But,\" I instantly exclaimed, \"have we not his nephew, the duc  d'Aiguillon? He is well with the king, and I am certain will take the  most lively interest in all that concerns me.\"    \"I have no doubt of it,\" said Chon, with a sly look. \"Write to him to  come, and you can arrange your ulterior proceedings.\"    On this advice, which was quite to my taste, I went instantly to my  writing-table, the last present which the king had made me. It was made  of silver gilt, and china slabs beautifully painted. When I opened it,  a glass was lifted which reflected my countenance. I sat down and wrote  the following note to the duc d'Aiguillon:--    \"You must be content. I want your assistance, I really want it. The  moment has come for deserving all my confidence. Will you have it at all  risks and perils? Reflect well before you undertake this: if you accept,  come to-day at five o'clock precisely, neither later nor sooner.\"    A little while afterwards the following reply was brought.    \"One thing displeases me in your letter which else enchants me. You  appear to doubt my obedience. Am I not your slave? And when you say to  me _go_, will I not _go_? Rely on me as on yourself; even more: for your  vivacity may lead you into error, and I shall preserve my reason. Yes,  madame, I will, when near you, preserve my reason when your interests  are at stake. At the fixed hour I shall have the honor to lay at your  feet my respectful homage and boundless devotion.\"    It was impossible to express a real sentiment with more delicacy. I  was charmed at it, no longer doubting that the duke would consider my  interests as his own. I awaited the hour of five with impatience,  when my good fortune brought the prince de Soubise. After the first  compliments,    \"Well, madame la comtesse, when is your presentation to take place?\"    \"I do not know, monsieur le marechal; there are obstacles in the way.  I fear that they who wish to injure me abuse their influence with the  king.\"    \"I see that his majesty hesitates, altho' he is desirous of giving you  station. He must be stimulated to know that he is master; and that if he  shows any wavering in this particular, it will be made use of to govern  him hereafter.\"    Heartily did I applaud the language of M. de Soubise: I did not suspect  that the dear prince had another motive behind. At the end of the  interview he said,    \"Madame, you would not have been as you now are had you been more  conciliatory towards me. I know the king, and know how to manage him. I  flatter myself that you would have been now presented had you deigned to  hear my advice.\"    \"Did I reject it? Was I wrong in declining to have mademoiselle Guimard  as ambassadress? Were you assured of her silence? Might she not have  compromised us?\"    \"You are right; I did as one would have done at your age, and you have  done as I should do at mine; but there is always time to amend.\"    \"Certainly, prince.\"    \"You accept my advice, then.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, seeing the defile in which he wished to entrap me,  \"yes, if I am presented thro' your influence, from that moment you  become my guide and mentor. But it is important that the presentation be  not delayed; I rely on you to speak to the king this day about it; and  I know that he will give me every particular of the immense service you  will render me.\"    For once the madcap girl got the better of the practised courtier. M. de  Soubise, taken in his own snare, politely excused himself, and left me  with an assurance that he would speak to the king. He did speak, but  obtained nothing more than any other. You will see in my next letter  that I did not arrive at the accomplishment of my wishes without much  trouble.

Then he lifted his head, panting, his  pointed ears and ruddy face grotesquely patched with snow. At this  moment a great puff of the white powder was flapped into his eyes, a  feathery dark body jumped up from under his very nose, and the crafty  old bird went whirring off triumphantly to the nearest tree. With his  tongue hanging out, the fox stared foolishly after him, then slunk  away into the woods. And the white rabbit, nibbling at his  birch-twigs, was left in undisputed possession of the scintillating  rainbow world.          By the Winter Tide      Behind the long, slow-winding barrier of the dyke the marshes of  Tantramar lay secure, mile on mile of blue-white radiance under the  unclouded moon. Outside the dyke it was different. Mile on mile of  tumbled, mud-stained ice-cakes, strewn thickly over the Tantramar  flats, waited motionless under the moon for the incoming tide. Twice  in each day the far-wandering tide of Fundy would come in, to lift,  and toss, and grind, and roll the ice-cakes, then return again to its  deep channels; and with every tide certain of the floes would go forth  to be lost in the open sea, while the rest would sink back to their  tumbled stillness on the mud. Just now the flood was coming in. From  all along the outer fringes of the flats came a hoarse, desolate roar;  and in the steady light the edges of the ice-field began to turn and  flash, the strange motion creeping gradually inland toward that  impassive bulwark of the dyke. Had it been daylight, the chaotic  ice-field would have shown small beauty, every wave-beaten floe being  soiled and streaked with rust-coloured Tantramar mud. But under the  transfiguring touch of the moon the unsightly levels changed to plains  of infinite mystery--expanses of shattered, white granite, as it were,  fretted and scrawled with blackness--reaches of loneliness older than  time. So well is the mask of eternity assumed by the mutable moonlight  and the ephemeral ice.    Nearer and nearer across the waste drew the movement that marked the  incoming flood. Then from over the dyke-top floated a noiseless,  winnowing, sinister shape which seemed the very embodiment of the  desolation. The great white owl of the north, driven down from his  Arctic hunting-grounds by hunger, came questing over the ragged  levels. His long, soft-feathered wings moved lightly as a ghost, and  almost touched the ice-cakes now and then as his round, yellow eyes,  savagely hard and brilliant, searched the dark crevices for prey. With  his black beak, his black talons protruding from the mass of snowy  feathers which swathed his legs, and the dark bars on his plumage, one  might have fancied him a being just breathed into menacing and  furtive life by the sorcery of the scene.    Suddenly, with a motion almost as swift as light, the great owl  swooped and struck. Swift as he was, however, this time he struck just  too late. A spot of dark on the edge of an ice-cake vanished. It was a  foraging muskrat who had seen the approaching doom in time and slipped  into a deep and narrow crevice. Here, on the wet mud, he crouched  trembling, while the baffled bird reached down for him with vainly  clutching claws.    On either side of the two ice-cakes which had given the muskrat  refuge, was a space of open mud which he knew it would be death to  cross. Each time those deadly black talons clutched at him, he  flattened himself to the ground in panic; but there were several  inches to spare between his throat and death. The owl glared down with  fixed and flaming eyes, then gave up his useless efforts. But he  showed no inclination to go away. He knew that the muskrat could not  stay for ever down in that muddy crevice. So he perched himself bolt  upright on the very edge, where he could keep secure watch upon his  intended victim, while at the same time his wide, round eyes might  detect any movement of life among the surrounding ice-cakes.    The great flood-tides of Fundy, when once they have brimmed the steep  channels and begun to invade the vast reaches of the flats, lose  little time. When the baffled owl, hungry and obstinate, perched  himself on the edge of the ice-cake to wait for the muskrat to come  out, the roar of the incoming water and the line of tossing, gleaming  floes were half a mile away. In about four minutes the fringe of  tumult was not three hundred yards distant,--and at the same time the  vanguards of the flood, thin, frothy rivulets of chill water, were  trickling in through the crevice where the little prisoner crouched.  As the water touched his feet, the muskrat took heart anew,  anticipating a way of escape. As it deepened he stood upright,--and  instantly the white destruction cruelly watching struck again. This  time the muskrat felt those deadly talons graze the long, loose fur of  his back; and again he cowered down, inviting the flood to cover him.  As much at home under water as on dry land, he counted on easy escape  when the tide came in.    It happens, however, that the little kindreds of the wild are usually  more wise in the general than in the particular. The furry prisoner at  the bottom of the crevice knew about such regular phenomena as the  tides. He knew, too, that presently there would be water enough for  him to dive and swim beneath it, where his dreadful adversary could  neither reach him nor detect him. What he did not take into account  was the way the ice-cakes would grind and batter each other as soon as  the tide was deep enough to float them. Now, submerged till his furry  back and spiky tail were just even with the surface, his little, dark  eyes glanced up with mingled defiance and appeal at the savage, yellow  glare of the wide orbs staring down upon him. If only the water would  come, he would be safe. For a moment his eyes turned longingly toward  the dyke, and he thought of the narrow, safe hole, the long, ascending  burrow, and the warm, soft-lined chamber which was his nest, far up in  the heart of the dyke, high above the reach of the highest tides and  hidden from all enemies. But here in the hostile water, with a cruel  death hanging just above him, his valorous little heart ached with  homesickness for that nest in the heart of the dyke; and though the  water had no chill for his hardy blood, he shivered.    Meanwhile, the long line of clamour was rushing steadily inland. The  roar suddenly crashed into thunder on the prisoner's ears and a rush  of water swept him up. The white owl spread his wings and balanced  himself on tiptoe, as the ice-cake on which he was perching lurched  and rolled. Through all the clamour his ears, miraculously keen beyond  those of other birds, caught an agonized squeak from below. The  jostling ice had nipped the muskrat's hind quarters.    Though desperately hurt, so desperately that his strong hind legs were  almost useless, the brave little animal was not swerved from his  purpose. Straight from his prison, no longer now a refuge, he dived  and swam for home through the loud uproar. But the muskrat's small  forelegs are of little use in swimming, so much so that as a rule he  carries them folded under his chin while in the water. Now, therefore,  he was at a piteous disadvantage. His progress was slow, as in a  nightmare,--such a nightmare as must often come to muskrats if their  small, careless brains know how to dream. And in spite of his frantic  efforts, he found that he could not hold himself down in the water. He  kept rising toward the surface every other second.    Balancing had by this time grown too difficult for the great, white  owl, and he had softly lifted himself on hovering wings. But not for  an instant had he forgotten the object of his hunt. What were floods  and cataclysms to him in the face of his hunger? Swiftly his shining  eyes searched the foamy, swirling water. Then, some ten feet away,  beside a pitching floe, a furry back appeared for an instant. In that  instant he swooped. The back had vanished,--but unerringly his talons  struck beneath the surface--struck and gripped their prey. The next  moment the wide, white wings beat upward heavily, and the muskrat was  lifted from the water.    As he rose into the air, though near blind with the anguish of that  iron grip, the little victim writhed upward and bit furiously at his  enemy's leg. His jaws got nothing but a bunch of fluffy feathers,  which came away and floated down the moonlight air. Then the life sank  out of his brain, and he hung limply; and the broad wings bore him  inland over the dyke-top--straight over the warm and hidden nest where  he had longed to be.          The Rivals of Ringwaak    I.      A white flood, still and wonderful, the moonlight lay on the naked  rampikes and dense thickets of Ringwaak Hill. Beneath its magic the  very rocks, harsh bulks of granite, seemed almost afloat; and every  branch, spray and leaf, swam liquidly. The rampikes, towering trunks  of pine, fire-blasted and time-bleached, lifted lonely spires of  silver over the enchanted solitude.    Apparently, there was neither sound nor motion over all Ringwaak, or  over the wide wilderness spread out below its ken. But along the  secret trails, threading the thicket, and skirting the granite  boulders, life went on with an intensity all the deeper and more  stringent for the seal of silence laid upon it. The small, fugitive  kindreds moved noiselessly about their affairs, foraging, mating,  sometimes even playing, but ever watchful, a sleepless vigilance the  price of each hour's breath; while even more furtive, but more  intermittent in their watchfulness, the hunting and blood-loving  kindreds followed the trails.    Gliding swiftly from bush to rock, from rock to thicket, now for an  instant clear and terrible in a patch of moonlight, now ghost-gray and  still more terrible in the sharp-cut shadows, came a round-eyed,  crouching shape.
