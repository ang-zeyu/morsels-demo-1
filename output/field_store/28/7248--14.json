C'est le bon vin qui danse ici,         C'est le bon vin qui danse.                     Gai lon la!                     Vive la lirette!                     Des Filettes                     Il y en aura!'      Vivent les Filettes! The girls of Quebec--first in beauty, last in love,  and nowhere in scorn of a gallant worthy of them!\" continued Bigot.  \"What say you, De Pean? Are you not prepared to toast the belles of  Quebec?\"    \"That I am, your Excellency!\" De Pean was unsteady upon his feet, as he  rose to respond to the Intendant's challenge. He pot-valiantly drew his  sword, and laid it on the table. \"I will call on the honorable company  to drink this toast on their knees, and there is my sword to cut the  legs off any gentleman who will not kneel down and drink a full cup to  the bright eyes of the belle of Quebec--The incomparable Angelique des  Meloises!\"    The toast suited their mood. Every one filled up his cup in honor of a  beauty so universally admired.    \"Kneel down, all,\" cried the Intendant, \"or De Pean will hamstring us!\"  All knelt down with a clash--some of them unable to rise again. \"We will  drink to the Angelique charms of the fair Des Meloises. Come now, all  together!--as the jolly Dutchmen of Albany say, 'Upp seys over!'\"    Such of the company as were able resumed their seats amid great laughter  and confusion, when the Sieur Deschenaux, a reckless young gallant,  ablaze with wine and excitement, stood up, leaning against the table.  His fingers dabbled in his wine-cup as he addressed them, but he did not  notice it.    \"We have drunk with all the honors,\" said he, \"to the bright eyes of the  belle of Quebec. I call on every gentleman now, to drink to the still  brighter eyes of the belle of New France!\"    \"Who is she? Name! name!\" shouted a dozen voices; \"who is the belle of  New France?\"    \"Who is she? Why, who can she be but the fair Angelique, whom we have  just honored?\" replied De Pean, hotly, jealous of any precedence in that  quarter.    \"Tut!\" cried Deschenaux, \"you compare glowworms with evening stars, when  you pretend to match Angelique des Meloises with the lady I propose to  honor! I call for full brimmers--cardinal's hats--in honor of the belle  of New France--the fair Amelie de Repentigny!\"    Le Gardeur de Repentigny was sitting leaning on his elbow, his face  beaming with jollity, as he waited, with a full cup, for Deschenaux's  toast. But no sooner did he hear the name of his sister from those lips  than he sprang up as though a serpent had bit him. He hurled his goblet  at the head of Deschenaux with a fierce imprecation, and drew his sword  as he rushed towards him.    \"A thousand lightnings strike you! How dare you pollute that holy name,  Deschenaux? Retract that toast instantly, or you shall drink it in  blood--retract, I say!\"    The guests rose to their feet in terrible uproar. Le Gardeur struggled  violently to break through a number of those who interposed between him  and Deschenaux, who, roused to frenzy by the insult from Le Gardeur,  had also drawn his sword, and stood ready to receive the assault of his  antagonist.    The Intendant, whose courage and presence of mind never forsook him,  pulled Deschenaux down upon his seat and held fast his sword arm,  shouting in his ear,--    \"Are you mad, Deschenaux? You knew she was his sister, and how he  worships her! Retract the toast--it was inopportune! Besides, recollect  we want to win over De Repentigny to the Grand Company!\"    Deschenaux struggled for a minute, but the influence of the Intendant  was all-powerful over him. He gave way. \"Damn De Repentigny,\" said he,  \"I only meant to do honor to the pretty witch. Who would have expected  him to take it up in that manner?\"    \"Any one who knows him; besides,\" continued the Intendant, \"if you must  toast his sister, wait till we get him body and soul made over to the  Grand Company, and then he will care no more for his sister's fame than  you do for yours.\"    \"But the insult! He has drawn blood with the goblet,\" said Deschenaux,  wiping his forehead with his fingers; \"I cannot pardon that!\"    \"Tut, tut; fight him another day. But you shall not fight here! Cadet  and Le Mercier have pinned the young Bayard, I see; so you have a chance  to do the honorable; Deschenaux; go to him, retract the toast, and say  you had forgotten the fair lady was his sister.\"    Deschenaux swallowed his wrath, rose up, and sheathed his sword. Taking  the Intendant by the arm, he went up to Le Gardeur, who was still trying  to advance. Deschenaux held up his hand deprecatingly. \"Le Gardeur,\"  said he, with an air of apparent contrition, \"I was wrong to offer that  toast. I had forgotten the fair lady was your sister. I retract the  toast, since it is disagreeable to you, although all would have been  proud to drink it.\"    Le Gardeur was as hard to appease as he was easy to excite to anger. He  still held his drawn sword in his hand.    \"Come!\" cried Bigot, \"you are as hard to please as Villiers Vendome,  whom the King himself could not satisfy. Deschenaux says he is sorry.  A gentleman cannot say more; so shake hands and be friends, De  Repentigny.\"    Impervious to threats, and often to reason, Le Gardeur could not resist  an appeal to his generosity.    He sheathed his sword, and held out his hand with frank forgiveness.  \"Your apology is ample, Sieur Deschenaux. I am satisfied you meant no  affront to my sister! It is my weak point, messieurs,\" continued he,  looking firmly at the company, ready to break out had he detected the  shadow of a sneer upon any one's countenance. \"I honor her as I do the  queen of heaven. Neither of their names ought to be spoken here.\"    \"Well said! Le Gardeur,\" exclaimed the Intendant. \"That's right,  shake hands, and be friends again. Blessed are quarrels that lead to  reconciliation and the washing out of feuds in wine. Take your seats,  gentlemen.\"    There was a general scramble back to the table. Bigot stood up in  renewed force.    \"Valets!\" cried he, \"bring in now the largest cups! We will drink  a toast five fathoms deep, in water of life strong enough to melt  Cleopatra's pearls, and to a jollier dame than Egypt's queen. But  first we will make Le Gardeur de Repentigny free of the guild of noble  partners of the company of adventurers trading in New France.\"    The valets flew in and out. In a few moments the table was replenished  with huge drinking-cups, silver flagons, and all the heavy impedimenta  of the army of Bacchus.    \"You are willing to become one of us, and enter the jolly guild of the  Grand Company?\" exclaimed the Intendant, taking Le Gardeur by the hand.    \"Yes, I am a stranger, and you may take me in. I claim admission,\"  replied Le Gardeur with drunken gravity, \"and by St. Pigot! I will be  true to the guild!\"    Bigot kissed him on both cheeks. \"By the boot of St. Benoit! you speak  like the King of Yvetot. Le Gardeur de Repentigny, you are fit to wear  fur in the Court of Burgundy.\"    \"You can measure my foot, Bigot,\" replied Le Gardeur, \"and satisfy the  company that I am able to wear the boot of St. Benoit.\"    \"By jolly St. Chinon! and you shall wear it, Le Gardeur,\" exclaimed  Bigot, handing him a quart flagon of wine, which Le Gardeur drank  without drawing breath. \"That boot fits,\" shouted the Intendant  exultingly; \"now for the chant! I will lead. Stop the breath of any one  who will not join in the chorus.\"    The Intendant in great voice led off a macaronic verse of Moliere, that  had often made merry the orgies of Versailles:           \"'Bene, bene, bene, respondere!         Dignus, dignus es, entrare         In nostro laeto corpore!'\"      A tintamarre of voices and a jingle of glasses accompanied the violins  and tambours de Basque as the company stood up and sang the song,  winding up with a grand burst at the chorus:           \"'Vivat! vivat! vivat! cent fois vivat!         Novus socius qui tam bene parlat!         Mille mille annis et manget et bibat,         Fripet et friponnat!'\"      Hands were shaken all round, congratulations, embracings, and filthy  kisses showered upon Le Gardeur to honor his admission as a partner of  the Grand Company.    \"And now,\" continued Bigot, \"we will drink a draught long as the bell  rope of Notre Dame. Fill up brimmers of the quintessence of the grape,  and drain them dry in honor of the Friponne!\"    The name was electric. It was, in the country, a word of opprobrium, but  at Beaumanoir it was laughed at with true Gallic nonchalance. Indeed,  to show their scorn of public opinion, the Grand Company had lately  launched a new ship upon the Great Lakes to carry on the fur trade, and  had appropriately and mockingly named her, \"La Friponne.\"    The toast of La Friponne was drunk with applause, followed by a wild  bacchanalian song.    The Sieur Morin had been a merchant in Bordeaux whose bond was held  in as little value as his word. He had lately removed to New France,  transferred the bulk of his merchandise to the Friponne, and become an  active agent of the Grand Company.    \"La Friponne!\" cried he; \"I have drunk success to her with all my heart  and throat; but I say she will never wear a night-cap and sleep quietly  in our arms until we muzzle the Golden Dog that barks by night and by  day in the Rue Buade.\"    \"That is true, Morin!\", interrupted Varin. \"The Grand Company will  never know peace until we send"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#14)"],[1,"Master Horse, who was capable, but  inexperienced.    \"It looks more like the first half of an animal than anything else in  the world,\" he said. \"Fore-legs and no hind.\"    \"It's only one of those pink monkey things,\" said the Eldest Mare.  \"They're a sort of river monkey. They're quite common on the plains.\"    Ugh-lomi continued his oblique advance. The Eldest Mare was struck with  the want of motive in his proceedings.    \"Fool!\" said the Eldest Mare, in a quick conclusive way she had. She  resumed her grazing. The Master Horse and the Second Mare followed suit.    \"Look! he's nearer,\" said the Foal with a stripe.    One of the younger foals made uneasy movements. Ugh-lomi squatted down,  and sat regarding the horses fixedly. In a little while he was  satisfied that they meant neither flight nor hostilities. He began to  consider his next procedure. He did not feel anxious to kill, but he had  his axe with him, and the spirit of sport was upon him. How would one  kill one of these creatures?--these great beautiful creatures!    Eudena, watching him with a fearful admiration from the cover of the  bracken, saw him presently go on all fours, and so proceed again. But  the horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped, and the Master Horse  threw up his head and gave the word to move. Ugh-lomi thought they were  off for good, but after a minute's gallop they came round in a wide  curve, and stood winding him. Then, as a rise in the ground hid him,  they tailed out, the Master Horse leading, and approached him spirally.    He was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as they were of his.  And at this stage it would seem he funked. He knew this kind of stalking  would make red deer or buffalo charge, if it were persisted in. At any  rate Eudena saw him jump up and come walking towards her with the fern  plumes held in his hand.    She stood up, and he grinned to show that the whole thing was an immense  lark, and that what he had done was just what he had planned to do from  the very beginning. So that incident ended. But he was very thoughtful  all that day.    The next day this foolish drab creature with the leonine mane, instead  of going about the grazing or hunting he was made for, was prowling  round the horses again. The Eldest Mare was all for silent contempt. \"I  suppose he wants to learn something from us,\" she said, and \"_Let_ him.\"  The next day he was at it again. The Master Horse decided he meant  absolutely nothing. But as a matter of fact, Ugh-lomi, the first of men  to feel that curious spell of the horse that binds us even to this day,  meant a great deal. He admired them unreservedly. There was a rudiment  of the snob in him, I am afraid, and he wanted to be near these  beautifully-curved animals. Then there were vague conceptions of a kill.  If only they would let him come near them! But they drew the line, he  found, at fifty yards. If he came nearer than that they moved off--with  dignity. I suppose it was the way he had blinded Andoo that made him  think of leaping on the back of one of them. But though Eudena after a  time came out in the open too, and they did some unobtrusive stalking,  things stopped there.    Then one memorable day a new idea came to Ugh-lomi. The horse looks down  and level, but he does not look up. No animals look up--they have too  much common-sense. It was only that fantastic creature, man, could waste  his wits skyward. Ugh-lomi made no philosophical deductions, but he  perceived the thing was so. So he spent a weary day in a beech that  stood in the open, while Eudena stalked. Usually the horses went into  the shade in the heat of the afternoon, but that day the sky was  overcast, and they would not, in spite of Eudena's solicitude.    It was two days after that that Ugh-lomi had his desire. The day was  blazing hot, and the multiplying flies asserted themselves. The horses  stopped grazing before midday, and came into the shadow below him, and  stood in couples nose to tail, flapping.    The Master Horse, by virtue of his heels, came closest to the tree. And  suddenly there was a rustle and a creak, a _thud_.... Then a sharp  chipped flint bit him on the cheek. The Master Horse stumbled, came on  one knee, rose to his feet, and was off like the wind. The air was full  of the whirl of limbs, the prance of hoofs, and snorts of alarm.  Ugh-lomi was pitched a foot in the air, came down again, up again, his  stomach was hit violently, and then his knees got a grip of something  between them. He found himself clutching with knees, feet, and hands,  careering violently with extraordinary oscillation through the air--his  axe gone heaven knows whither. \"Hold tight,\" said Mother Instinct, and  he did.    He was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face, some of it between his  teeth, and of green turf streaming past in front of his eyes. He saw the  shoulder of the Master Horse, vast and sleek, with the muscles flowing  swiftly under the skin. He perceived that his arms were round the neck,  and that the violent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm.    Then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-stems, and then there  were fronds of bracken about, and then more open turf. Then a stream of  pebbles rushing past, little pebbles flying sideways athwart the stream  from the blow of the swift hoofs. Ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully  sick and giddy, but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because he  was uncomfortable.    He dared not leave his grip, but he tried to make himself more  comfortable. He released his hug on the neck, gripping the mane  instead. He slipped his knees forward, and pushing back, came into a  sitting position where the quarters broaden. It was nervous work, but he  managed it, and at last he was fairly seated astride, breathless indeed,  and uncertain, but with that frightful pounding of his body at any rate  relieved.    Slowly the fragments of Ugh-lomi's mind got into order again. The pace  seemed to him terrific, but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust  his first frantic terror. The air rushed by, sweet and wonderful, the  rhythm of the hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again.  They were on turf now, a wide glade--the beech-trees a hundred yards  away on either side, and a succulent band of green starred with pink  blossom and shot with silver water here and there, meandered down the  middle. Far off was a glimpse of blue valley--far away. The exultation  grew. It was man's first taste of pace.    Then came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering this  way and that, and then a couple of jackals, mistaking Ugh-lomi for a  lion, came hurrying after him. And when they saw it was not a lion they  still came on out of curiosity. On galloped the horse, with his one  idea of escape, and after him the jackals, with pricked ears and  quickly-barked remarks. \"Which kills which?\" said the first jackal.  \"It's the horse being killed,\" said the second. They gave the howl of  following, and the horse answered to it as a horse answers nowadays to  the spur.    On they rushed, a little tornado through the quiet day, putting up  startled birds, sending a dozen unexpected things darting to cover,  raising a myriad of indignant dung-flies, smashing little blossoms,  flowering complacently, back into their parental turf. Trees again, and  then splash, splash across a torrent; then a hare shot out of a tuft of  grass under the very hoofs of the Master Horse, and the jackals left  them incontinently. So presently they broke into the open again, a wide  expanse of turfy hillside--the very grassy downs that fall northward  nowadays from the Epsom Stand.    The first hot bolt of the Master Horse was long since over. He was  falling into a measured trot, and Ugh-lomi, albeit bruised exceedingly  and quite uncertain of the future, was in a state of glorious enjoyment.  And now came a new development. The pace broke again, the Master Horse  came round on a short curve, and stopped dead....    Ugh-lomi became alert. He wished he had a flint, but the throwing-flint  he had carried in a thong about his waist was--like the axe--heaven  knows where. The Master Horse turned his head, and Ugh-lomi became aware  of an eye and teeth. He whipped his leg into a position of security, and  hit at the cheek with his fist. Then the head went down somewhere out of  existence apparently, and the back he was sitting on flew up into a  dome. Ugh-lomi became a thing of instinct again--strictly prehensile; he  held by knees and feet, and his head seemed sliding towards the turf.  His fingers were twisted into the shock of mane, and the rough hair of  the horse saved him. The gradient he was on lowered again, and  then--\"Whup!\" said Ugh-lomi astonished, and the slant was the other way  up. But Ugh-lomi was a thousand generations nearer the primordial than  man: no monkey could have held on better. And the lion had been training  the horse for countless generations against the tactics of rolling and  rearing back. But he kicked like a master, and buck-jumped rather  neatly. In five minutes Ugh-lomi lived a lifetime. If he came off the  horse would kill him, he felt assured.    Then the Master Horse decided to stick to his old tactics again, and  suddenly went off at a gallop. He headed down the slope, taking the  steep places at a rush, swerving neither to the right nor to the left,  and, as they rode down, the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight  behind the approaching skirmishers of oak and hawthorn. They skirted a  sudden hollow with the pool of a spring, rank weeds and silver bushes.  The ground grew softer and the grass taller, and on the right-hand side  and the left came scattered bushes of May--still splashed with belated  blossom. Presently the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing  rider, and little flashes and gouts of blood came out on horse and man.  Then the way opened again.    And then came a"]]]
