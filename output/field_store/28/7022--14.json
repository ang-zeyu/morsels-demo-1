The crowd was enthusiastic.    \"Brave young feller,\" said somebody.    I blushed. This was fame.    \"Jumped in, he did, sure enough, an' saved the gentleman!\"    \"Be the old soul drownded?\"    \"That girt fule, 'Arry 'Awk!\"    I was sorry for Mr. Hawk. Popular opinion, in which the professor  wrathfully joined, was against him. I could not help thinking that my  fellow-conspirator did well to keep out of it all. He was now sitting  in the boat, which he had restored to its normal position, baling  pensively with an old tin can. To satire from the shore he paid no  attention.    The professor stood up and stretched out his hand to me.    I grasped it.    \"Mr. Garnet,\" he said, for all the world as if he had been the father  of the heroine of \"Hilda's Hero,\" \"we parted recently in anger. Let me  thank you for your gallant conduct, and hope that bygones will be  bygones.\"    [Illustration: \"Mr. Garnet,\" he said, \"we parted recently in anger. I  hope that bygones will be bygones.\"]    Like Mr. Samuel Weller, I liked his conversation much. It was \"werry  pretty.\"    I came out strong. I continued to hold his hand. The crowd raised a  sympathetic cheer.    I said:    \"Professor, the fault was mine. Show that you have forgiven me by  coming up to the farm and putting on something dry.\"    \"An excellent idea, me boy. I _am_ a little wet.\"    We walked briskly up the hill to the farm. Ukridge met us at the gate.    He diagnosed the situation rapidly.    \"You're all wet,\" he said.    I admitted it.    \"Professor Derrick has had an unfortunate boating accident,\" I  explained.    \"And Mr. Garnet heroically dived in, in all his clothes, and saved me  life,\" broke in the professor. \"A hero, sir. _A-choo!_\"    \"You're catching cold, old horse,\" said Ukridge, all friendliness and  concern, his little differences with the professor having vanished  like thawed snow. \"This'll never do. Come upstairs and get into  something of Garnet's. My own toggery wouldn't fit, what? Come along,  come along. I'll get you some hot water. Mrs. Beale--Mrs. _Beale_! We  want a large can of hot water. At once. What? Yes, immediately. What?  Very well, then, as soon as you can. Now, then, Garny, my boy, out  with the duds. What do you think of this, now, professor? A sweetly  pretty thing in gray flannel. Here's a shirt. Get out of that wet  toggery, and Mrs. Beale shall dry it. Don't attempt to tell me about  it till you've changed. Socks? Socks forward. Show socks. Here you  are. Coat? Try this blazer. That's right. That's right.\"    He bustled about till the professor was clothed, then marched him  downstairs and gave him a cigar.    \"Now, what's all this? What happened?\"    The professor explained. He was severe in his narration upon the  unlucky Mr. Hawk.    \"I was fishing, Mr. Ukridge, with me back turned, when I felt the boat  rock violently from one side to the other to such an extent that I  nearly lost me equilibrium. And then the boat upset. The man's a fool,  sir. I could not see what had happened, my back being turned, as I  say.\"    \"Garnet must have seen. What happened, Marmaduke?\"    I tried to smooth things over for Mr. Hawk.    \"It was very sudden,\" I said. \"It seemed to me as if the man had got  an attack of cramp. That would account for it. He has the reputation  of being a most sober and trustworthy fellow.\"    \"Never trust that sort of man,\" said Ukridge. \"They are always the  worst. It's plain to me that this man was beastly drunk, and upset the  boat while trying to do a dance.\"    The professor was in the best of tempers, and I worked strenuously to  keep him so. My scheme had been so successful that its iniquity did  not worry me. I have noticed that this is usually the case in matters  of this kind. It is the bungled crime that brings remorse.    \"We must go round the links together one of these days, Mr. Garnet,\"  said the professor. \"I have noticed you there on several occasions,  playing a strong game. I have lately taken to using a Schenectady  putter. It is wonderful what a difference it makes.\"    Golf is a great bond of union. We wandered about the grounds  discussing the game, the _entente cordiale_ growing more firmly  established every moment.    \"We must certainly arrange a meeting,\" concluded the professor. \"I  shall be interested to see how we stand with regard to one another. I  have improved my game considerably since I have been down  here--considerably.\"    \"My only feat worthy of mention since I started the game,\" I said,  \"has been to halve a round with Angus McLurkin at St. Andrew's.\"    \"_The_ McLurkin?\" asked the professor, impressed.    \"Yes. But it was one of his very off days, I fancy. He must have had  gout, or something. And I have certainly never played so well since.\"    \"Still--\" said the professor. \"Yes, we must really arrange to meet.\"    With Ukridge, who was in one of his less tactless moods, he became  very friendly.    Ukridge's ready agreement with his strictures on the erring Hawk had a  great deal to do with this. When a man has a grievance he feels drawn  to those who will hear him patiently and sympathize. Ukridge was all  sympathy.    \"The man is an unprincipled scoundrel,\" he said, \"and should be torn  limb from limb. Take my advice, Cholmondeley, and don't go out with  him again. Show him that you are not a man to be trifled with. The  spilled child dreads the water, what? Human life isn't safe with such  men as Hawk roaming about.\"    \"You are perfectly right, sir. The man can have no defense. I shall  not employ him again.\"    I felt more than a little guilty while listening to this duet on the  subject of the man whom I had lured from the straight and narrow  path. But my attempts at excusing him were ill received. Indeed, the  professor showed such distinct signs of becoming heated that I  abandoned my fellow-conspirator to his fate with extreme promptness.  After all, an addition to the stipulated reward--one of these  days--would compensate him for any loss which he might sustain from  the withdrawal of the professor's custom. Mr. Harry Hawk was in good  enough case. I would see that he did not suffer.    Filled with these philanthropic feelings, I turned once more to talk  with the professor of niblicks and approach shots and holes done in  three without a brassy. We were a merry party at lunch--a lunch,  fortunately, in Mrs. Beale's best vein, consisting of a roast chicken  and sweets. Chicken had figured somewhat frequently of late on our  daily bill of fare.    We saw the professor off the premises in his dried clothes, and I  turned back to put the fowls to bed in a happier frame of mind than I  had known for a long time. I whistled rag-time airs as I worked.    \"Rum old buffer,\" said Ukridge meditatively. \"My goodness, I should  have liked to see him in the water. Why do I miss these good things?\"          SOME EMOTIONS    XII      The fame which came to me through that gallant rescue was a little  embarrassing. I was a marked man. Did I walk through the village,  heads emerged from windows, and eyes followed me out of sight. Did I  sit on the beach, groups formed behind me and watched in silent  admiration. I was the man of the moment.    \"If we'd wanted an advertisement for the farm,\" said Ukridge on one of  these occasions, \"we couldn't have had a better one than you, Garny,  my boy. You have brought us three distinct orders for eggs during the  last week. And I'll tell you what it is, we need all the orders we  can get that'll bring us in ready money. The farm is in a critical  condition, Marmaduke. The coffers are low, decidedly low. And I'll  tell you another thing. I'm getting precious tired of living on  nothing but chicken and eggs. So's Millie, though she doesn't say so.\"    \"So am I,\" I said, \"and I don't feel like imitating your wife's proud  reserve. I never want to see a chicken again except alive.\"    For the last week monotony had been the keynote of our commissariat.  We had cold chicken and eggs for breakfast, boiled chicken and eggs  for lunch, and roast chicken and eggs for dinner. Meals became a  nuisance, and Mrs. Beale complained bitterly that we did not give her  a chance. She was a cook who would have graced an alderman's house,  and served up noble dinners for gourmets, and here she was in this  remote corner of the world ringing the changes on boiled chicken and  roast chicken and boiled eggs and poached eggs. Mr. Whistler, set to  paint signboards for public houses, might have felt the same restless  discontent. As for her husband, the hired retainer, he took life as  tranquilly as ever, and seemed to regard the whole thing as the most  exhilarating farce he had ever been in. I think he looked on Ukridge  as an amiable lunatic, and was content to rough it a little in order  to enjoy the privilege of observing his movements. He made no  complaints of the food. When a man has supported life for a number of  years on incessant army beef, the monotony of daily chicken and eggs  scarcely strikes him.    \"The fact is,\" said Ukridge, \"these tradesmen round here seem to be a  sordid, suspicious lot. They clamor for money.\"    He mentioned a few examples. Vickers, the butcher, had been the first  to strike, with the remark that he would like to see the color of Mr.  Ukridge's money before supplying further joints. Dawlish, the grocer,  had expressed almost exactly similar sentiments two days later, and  the ranks of these passive resisters had been receiving fresh recruits  ever since. To a man the tradesmen of Lyme Regis seemed as deficient  in simple faith as they were in Norman blood.    \"Can't you pay some of them a little on account?\" I suggested. \"It  would set them going again.\"    \"My dear old man,\" said Ukridge impressively, \"we need every penny of  ready money we can raise for the farm. The place simply eats money.  That infernal roop let us in for I don't know what.\"    That insidious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#14)"],[1,"cared for the little ones.  All were as happy and  thoughtless as children could be.  In their glee they took off their  boots and ran with bare feet.    Now below the cliff on the ice waited some Eskimo hunters.  They  watched the huge cakes of ice farther out break off and float away.  They knew that soon the ice nearer shore would crack and float off in  the same manner.    They knew also that when the shore ice cracked the seals would rise and  push their noses out of the water for air.    The hunters, therefore, sat for hours upon their three-legged stools,  waiting with ever-ready spears.    The children, not seeing the hunters, ran more noisily among the high  rocks of the cliff.    At last with a booming sound the ice cracked and spread apart.  The  water gushed up and spread lightly over the ice.  The hunters waited  breathlessly.    It was but a moment before the brown nose of a seal appeared.  The  hunters lifted their spears to strike.  But at that instant came a  wilder shout from the children and the brown nose of the seal  disappeared.    \"Oh,\" cried the hunter, angrily, \"I wish the cliff would topple over on  those noisy children!\"    Hardly were the words spoken when with a great clash the cliff did  topple over.  As the falling stones rattled about him the hunter heard  the shrieks of the children.    Neither the hunters nor the children were ever again seen in the  village.  But the next day some birds with pink wet feet ran about  among the stones at the foot of the cliffs.  As they ran they made  strange cries which sounded half like children's laughter.    \"Listen,\" say the Eskimo people, when they hear the sea-pigeons cry,  \"Listen to the voices of the little children who shouted so loud that  they frightened away the seals!\"    \"Look!\" cry the Eskimo children, when they see the pink feet of the  sea-pigeons, \"those are the cold, bare little feet of the Eskimo  children who ran and shouted on the cliffs above!\"          THE SANDPIPER[1]      Across the narrow beach we flit,      One little sandpiper and I;    And fast I gather, bit by bit,      The scattered driftwood bleached and dry.    The wild waves reach their hands for it,      The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,    As up and down the beach we flit,--      One little sandpiper and I.      Above our heads the sullen clouds      Scud black and swift across the sky;    Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds      Stand out the white lighthouses high.    Almost as far as eye can reach      I see the close-reefed vessels fly,    As fast we flit along the beach,--      One little sandpiper and I.      I watch him as he skims along,      Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;    He starts not at my fitful song,      Or flash of fluttering drapery;    He has no thought of any wrong;      He scans me with a fearless eye.    Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong,      The little sandpiper and I.      Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night      When the loosed storm breaks furiously?    My driftwood fire will burn so bright!      To what warm shelter canst thou fly?    I do not fear for thee, though wroth      The tempest rushes through the sky;    For are we not God's children both,      Thou, little sandpiper, and I?               --Mrs. Thaxter.

Cranes always dreaded the cold and flew away to the summer-land  at the first glitter of the frost.    The crane leader had a loud, hoarse voice, and he called and called to  his flock to hurry.  The cranes came from all directions at the call of  their leader.  The father and mother cranes came.  The old cranes came  and the young cranes came.  Even the babies, whose feathers were scarce  grown, came flying at the call of the leader.    All the cranes were happy, for they were going to the summer-land.  They were glad to go, for already the frost jewels sparkled on the  brown grasses and the cold winds were beginning to blow.    \"Come! come!\" cried the crane leader, and his voice was hoarse with  shouting.  \"Come!  It is full time we were off!\"    Young and old spread their wings for flight.  They waited a moment for  their leader to take his place.  As they waited the cranes glanced down  to the cold, bare country which they were about to leave.    Thus looking down, the cranes saw a beautiful maiden standing alone at  the edge of the village.    \"How lovely she is!\" said the crane leader.  \"And how lonely she seems!\"    \"How thin her dress is!\" said another crane.    \"See, she is weeping!\" cried a third.  Just at that moment the maiden  looked up and saw the flock of cranes above her.    \"Oh,\" she cried, \"you are going to the summer-land.  I wish I had  wings.  I would fly away with you!    \"Alas! in this cold, cheerless Northland I shall starve and freeze.  I  have no home.  I have no friends.    \"There is no oil in my stone stove!  There is no meat in my kettle.  What shall I do when the thick snow flies and the winter winds cut like  knives?\"    The crane leader looked down at the beautiful maiden in pity.  The  whole flock, young and old, were filled with a wish to help the girl.  It was very sad, they said, that one so young and lovely should ever be  cold or hungry or unhappy.    \"Let us carry the maiden with us to the summer-land!\" whispered a young  crane.    \"Yes, let us take her to the land of ever-lasting summer,\" begged an  old crane.    \"There she might gather food from the grain-fields.  She might pick  berries by the roadside.  She might drink from the clear, cool brooks  that run to the sea,\" said the leader.    Following their leader, the whole flock swept down to the earth.  They  gathered about the lovely, lonely maiden.    They lifted her on their widespread wings and bore her up into the air.    The maiden's long dark hair floated out like a cloud.  She smiled  happily as the cranes with one voice told her of the summer-land to  which they would carry her.    With wings outspread, that she might not fall, the cranes bore the  maiden away.  Day and night, night and day, they carried her and never  seemed to tire.    And the maiden had no fear.  She laughed in sheer happiness when they  told her again and again of the beautiful country to which they  journeyed.    For into that land, the cranes told her, neither cold nor hunger came.  They would show her the richest grain-fields.  They would tell her  where the sweetest berries grew.  They would show her wondrous blossoms  which grew for her in the distant summer-land.    The beautiful maiden was never again seen in the cold, dreary  Northland, for to this day she wanders beside the sweet-voiced streams  in the far-off summer-land.    But season by season the cranes, with wide-spread wings and hoarse  cries, return to the Northland at nesting-time.    There they remain through the short sunny summer, but when the first  snowflakes flutter through the air the cranes prepare to fly away.    And even to this day they circle about on widespread wings as though  they again carried the beautiful maiden.    Even to this day the cranes, young and old, shout so loudly the praises  of the summer-land that their voices are hoarse and harsh.
