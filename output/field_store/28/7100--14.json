Although the route was only sixteen miles long the innovation was  such a novel and tremendous one that all along the way crowds of  spectators assembled to watch the passing of the magic train. At the  starting point near the Hudson there was a dense throng of curious  onlookers who gathered to see for the first time in all their lives the  steam locomotive and its brigade of coaches,--for in those days people  never spoke of a train of cars; a group of railroad carriages was always  known as a brigade, and the term _coach_ was, and in many cases still is  applied to the cars. This train that created so much interest was  practically like Stephenson's English trains, being made up of a small  locomotive, a tender, and two carriages constructed by fastening  stagecoach bodies on top of railroad trucks. Stout iron chains held  these vehicles together--a primitive, and as it subsequently proved, a  very impractical method of coupling.\"    \"It must have been a funny enough train!\" Steve exclaimed.    \"I doubt if it appeared so to the people of that time,\" his father  returned, \"for since the audience of that period had nothing with which  to compare it, it probably seemed quite the ordinary thing. Was it not  like the railroad trains used in England? How was America to know  anything different? Yes, I am sure the 'DeWitt Clinton' was considered a  very grand affair indeed, even though it was only a small engine without  a cab, and had barely enough platform for the engineer to stand upon  while he drove the engine and fed the pitch-pine logs into the furnace.\"    \"How many people did the train hold?\" inquired Steve, with growing  curiosity.    \"Each coach carried six persons inside and two outside,\" was Mr.  Tolman's reply, \"and on this first eventful trip not quite enough  adventurous souls could be found to fill the seats. Perhaps could the  unwary passengers who did go have foreseen the discomforts ahead of them  there would have been fewer yet. But often ignorance is bliss. It  certainly was so in this case for in high feather the fortunate ones  took their places, the envied of many a beholder.\"    \"What happened?\" asked the boy eagerly. \"Was the trip a success?\"    \"That depends on what you mean by success,\" laughed his father. \"If you  are asking whether the passengers arrived safely at Schenectady I can  assure you that they did; but if you wish to know whether the journey  was a comfortable one, and likely to convert the stranger to steam  travel, that is quite another matter. The description of the excursion  which history has handed down to us is very naive. In the first place  the pitch-pine fuel sent a smudge of smoke and cinders back over all the  passengers and if it did not entirely choke them it at least encrusted  them thickly with dirt, particularly the ones who sat outside. The  umbrellas they opened to protect themselves were soon demolished, their  coverings being blown away or burned up by the sparks. In fact, it was  only by continual alertness that the clothing of the venturesome  travelers was not ignited. In the meantime those inside the coaches  fared little better, for as the coaches were without springs and the  track was none too skilfully laid, the jolting of the cars all but sent  the heads of the passengers through the roof of the coaches. Added to  this the train proceeded in a series of jerks that wrenched the chains  and banged one coach into another with such violence that those outside  were in danger of being hurled down upon the track, and those inside  were tossed hither and thither from seat to seat. You will easily  comprehend that the outing was not one of unalloyed pleasure.\"    The boy laughed heartily.    \"Of course,\" went on Mr. Tolman, \"there was no help for anybody until  the first stopping place was reached; but when the engine slowed down  and the grimy, almost unrecognizable pilgrims had a chance to catch  their breath, something had to be done by way of a remedy. The remedy  fortunately was near at hand and consisted of nothing very difficult.  Some of the more enterprising of the company leaped out and tore the  rails from a near-by fence and after stretching the coupling chains taut,  they bound them to the wooden boards. In this way the coaches were kept  apart and the silk hats of the dignitaries who had been invited to  participate in the opening of the road rescued from total  annihilation.\"    \"I'll bet everybody was glad to disembark at Schenectady,\" declared  Stephen.    \"I'll wager they were! They must have been exhausted from being jounced  and jostled about. Nevertheless the novelty of the adventure probably  brought its own compensations, and they were doubtless diverted from  their woes by the sight of the cheering and envious spectators, the  terrified horses, and the open-mouthed children that greeted them  wherever they went.\"    \"But the promoters could hardly expect the public to be very keen for a  steam railroad after such an exhibition,\" reflected Steve.    \"Fortunately our forefathers were not as critical as you,\" said his  father, \"and in consequence the coach line from Albany to Schenectady  was speedily supplanted by a steam railroad, as were the various coach  lines into the interior of the State. As a result hundreds of  broken-down coach horses were turned out to pasture, a merciful thing.  Gradually a series of short steam railway lines were constructed from  one end of the State to the other, until in 1851 these were joined  together to make a continuous route to Lake Erie. Perhaps we have only  scant appreciation of the revolution that came with this advance in  transportation. It meant the beginning of travel and commerce between  the eastern States and those in the interior of the country; it also  meant the speedy shipment of eastern products to the West, where they  were greatly needed, and the reception of western commodities in the  East. But more than all this, it signified a bond of fellowship between  the scattered inhabitants of the same vast country who up to this time  had been almost total strangers to one another, and was a mighty stride  in the direction of national loyalty and sympathy. Therefore it was  entirely seemly that Millard Fillmore, then President of the United  States, and Daniel Webster, the Secretary of State, should be honored  guests at the celebration that attended the opening of the railroad.\"    \"Did the road reach no farther than Lake Erie?\" asked Stephen.    \"Not at first,\" replied his father. \"From that point commerce was  carried on by means of ships on the Great Lakes. But in time western  railroad companies began to build short stretches of track which later  on they joined together as the other railroad builders had done.\"    \"Did the line go all the way across the country?\"    \"Oh, no, indeed. Our trans-continental railroads were a mighty project in  themselves and their story is a romance which I will tell you some other  time. Before such stupendous enterprises could be realities, our young,  young country had a vast deal of growing to do, and its infant railroads  and engineering methods had to be greatly improved. So long as we still  built roads where the rails were liable to come up through the floor and  injure the passengers, and where the tracks were not strongly enough  constructed to resist floods and freshets, our steam locomotion could  not expect any universal degree of popularity.\"    \"I don't suppose, though, that the cows continued to tip the cars over  and turn the passengers out into the dirt as they did in the days of  Peter Cooper,\" mused Steve thoughtfully.    \"They may not have derailed the trains,\" his father replied quite  seriously, \"but they often did delay them. Nor could the passengers be  blamed for finding fault with the unheated cars, or the fact that  sometimes, when it snowed hard, the engineer ran his engine under cover  and refused to go on, leaving those on the train the choice of staying  where they were until the storm abated or going on foot to their  destination.\"    \"Not really!\"    \"Yes, indeed. Such things happened quite frequently. Then there are  stories of terrible gales when the snow piled up on the track until the  engine had to be dug out, for snow plows did not keep the tracks clear  then as they do now; nor was it an uncommon thing for the mud from the  spring washouts to submerge the rails, in which case the engines had to  be pulled out of the mire by oxen. In fact, at certain seasons of the  year some trains carried oxen for this very purpose. For you must  remember that the engines of that date were not powerful enough to make  progress through mud, snow, or against fierce head winds. Often a strong  gale would delay them for hours or bring them to a standstill  altogether.\"    \"Well, I guess it is no wonder we were not equipped to build a  trans-continental road under such conditions,\" said the lad, with a quiet  smile.    \"Oh, these defects were only a minor part of our railroad tribulations,\"  responded his father. \"For example, when Pennsylvania started her first  railroad the year after the line between New York and Schenectady was  laid, there was a fresh chapter of obstacles. Strangely enough, the  locomotive, 'Old Ironsides,' was built by Mr. M. W. Baldwin, whose name  has since become celebrated as the founder of the Baldwin Locomotive  Works. In 1832, however, the Baldwin locomotive was quite a different  product from the present-day magnificently constructed steam engine.  This initial attempt at locomotive building was a queer little engine  with wheels so light that unless there was plenty of ballast aboard it  was impossible to keep it on the track; and besides that, the poor wee  thing could not get up steam enough to start itself and in consequence  Mr. Baldwin and some of his machinists were obliged to give it a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#14)"],[1,"woman in the world. He must pay no  attention to her, but as soon as he caught her eye he must wish himself  changed into an elk. The change would take place immediately, and he  must go to feeding and not look at her again.    White Feather thanked his kind adviser, and when he turned to take his  leave he was gone as before.    He proceeded toward the lodge, met the female as had been foretold to  him, and became an elk. She reproached him that he had cast aside the  form of a man that he might avoid her.    \"I have traveled a great distance,\" she added, \"to see you and to become  your wife; for I have heard of your great achievements, and admire you  very much.\"    Now this woman was the sixth giant, who had assumed this disguise to  entrap White Feather.    Without a suspicion of her real character, her reproaches and her beauty  affected him so deeply that he wished himself a man again, and he at  once resumed his natural shape. They sat down together, and he began to  caress and to make love to her.    Soothed by her smiles and her gracious manners, he ventured to lay his  head on her lap, and in a little while he fell into a deep slumber.    Even then, such was her fear of White Feather, she doubted whether his  sleep might not be feigned. To assure herself she pushed his head aside,  and seeing that he remained unconscious, she quickly assumed her own  form as the sixth giant, took the plume from the brow of White Feather  and placed it upon his own head, and with a sudden blow of his war-club  changed him into a dog, in which degraded form he followed his enemy to  the lodge.    While these things were passing, there were living in an Indian village  at some distance, two sisters, the daughters of a chief, who were  rivals, and they were at that very time fasting to acquire power, for  the purpose of enticing the wearer of the white feather to visit their  lodge. They each secretly hoped to engage his affections, and each had  built a lodge in the border of the village encampment.    The giant knowing this, and having become possessed of the magic plume,  went immediately to visit them. As he approached, the sisters, who were  on the look-out at their lodge-doors, espied and recognized the feather.    The eldest sister had prepared her lodge with great show, and all the  finery she could command, so as to attract the eye. The youngest  touched nothing in her lodge, but left it in its ordinary state.    The eldest went out to meet the giant, and invited him in. He accepted  her invitation, and made her his wife. The youngest sister invited the  enchanted dog into her lodge, prepared him a good supper and a neat bed,  and treated him with much attention.    The giant, supposing that whoever possessed the white feather possessed  also all its virtues, went out upon the prairie to hunt, hallooing aloud  to the game to come and be killed; but the great hubbub he kept up  scared them away, and he returned at night with nothing but himself; for  he had shouted so lustily all day long that he had been even obliged to  leave the mighty halloo, with which he had set out, behind.    The dog went out the same day hunting upon the banks of a river. He  stole quietly along to the spot, and stepping into the water he drew out  a stone, which instantly became a beaver.    The next day the giant followed the dog, and hiding behind a tree, he  watched the manner in which the dog hunted in the river when he drew out  a stone, which at once turned into a beaver.    \"Ah, ha!\" said the giant to himself, \"I will catch some beaver for  myself.\"    And as soon as the dog had left the place, the giant went to the river,  and, imitating the dog, he drew out a stone, and was delighted to see  it, as soon as it touched the land, change into a fine fat beaver.    Tying it to his belt he hastened home, shouting a good deal, and  brandishing the white feather about, as if he were prepared now to show  them what he could do when he once tried. When he reached home he threw  it down, as is the custom, at the door of the lodge before he entered.    After being seated a short time, he gave a dry cough, and bade his wife  bring in his hunting girdle. She made dispatch to obey him, and  presently returned with the girdle, with nothing tied to it but a stone.    The next day, the dog finding that his method of catching beavers had  been discovered, went to a wood at some distance, and broke off a  charred limb from a burned tree, which instantly became a bear. The  giant, who appeared to have lost faith in his hulla-balooing, had again  watched him, did exactly as the dog had done, and carried a bear home;  but his wife, when she came to go out for it, found nothing but a black  stick tied to his belt.    And so it happened with every thing. Whatever the dog undertook,  prospered; whatever the giant attempted, failed. Every day the youngest  sister had reason to be more proud of the poor dog she had asked into  her lodge, and every day the eldest sister was made more aware, that  though she had married the white feather, the virtues of the magic  plume were not the personal property of the noisy giant.    At last the giant's wife determined that she would go to her father and  make known to him what a valuable husband she had, and how he furnished  her lodge with a great abundance of sticks and stones, which he would  pass upon her for bear and beaver. So, when her husband, whose brave  halloo had now died away to a feeble chirp, had started for the hunt,  she set out.    As soon as these two had gone away from the neighborhood, the dog made  signs to his mistress to sweat him after the manner of the Indians. He  had always been a good dog, and she was willing to oblige him. She  accordingly made a lodge just large enough for him to creep in. She then  put in heated stones, and poured water upon them, which raised a vapor  that filled the lodge and searched with its warmth to the very heart's  core of the enchanted dog.    When this had been kept up for the customary time, the enchanted dog was  completely sweated away, and in his stead, as might have been expected,  out came a very handsome young man, but, unhappily, without the power of  speech. In taking away the dog, it appears that the sweating-lodge had  also carried off the voice with it.    Meantime the elder sister had reached her father's, and, with much  circumstance and a very long face, had told him how that her sister was  supporting an idle dog, and entertaining him as her husband. In her  anxiety to make known her sister's affairs and the great scandal she was  bringing upon the family, the eldest forgot to say any thing of the  sticks and stones which her own husband brought home for bears and  beavers. The old man suspecting that there was magic about her house,  sent a deputation of young men and women to ask his youngest daughter to  come to him, and to bring her dog along with her. When the deputation  reached the lodge, they were surprised to find, in the place of the dog,  a fine young man; and on announcing their message, they all returned to  the old chief, who was no less surprised at the change.    He immediately assembled all the old and wise heads of the nation to  come and be witnesses to the exploits which it was reported that the  young man could perform. The sixth giant, although neither very old nor  very wise, thrust himself in among the relations of the old chief.    When they were all assembled and seated in a circle, the old chief took  his pipe and filled it, and passed it to the Indians around, to see if  any thing would happen when they smoked. They passed it on until it came  around to the Dog, who made a sign that it should be handed first to the  giant, which was done. And the giant puffed with all his might, and  shook the white feather upon his head, and swelled his chest; but  nothing came of it, except a great deal of smoke. The Dog then took it  himself. He made a sign to them to put the white feather upon his head.  This was no sooner done, than he recovered his speech, and, beginning to  draw upon the pipe at the same moment, behold, immense flocks of white  and blue pigeons rushed from the smoke.    From that moment the sixth giant was looked upon as an impostor, and as  soon as White Feather had, at the request of the company, faithfully  recounted his history, the old chief, who was one of the best-hearted  magicians that ever lived, ordered that the giant should be transformed  into a dog, and turned into the middle of the village, where the boys  should pelt him to death with clubs; which being done, the whole six  giants were at an end, and never troubled that neighborhood again,  forever after.    The chief then gave out a command, at the request of White Feather, that  all the young men should employ themselves four days in making arrows.  White Feather also asked for a buffalo robe. This he cut into thin  shreds, and in the night, when no one knew of it, he went and sowed them  about the prairie in every direction.    At the end of the four days, he invited them to gather together all of  their arrows, and to accompany him to a buffalo hunt. When they got out  upon the prairie, they found it covered with a great herd of buffaloes.  Of these they killed as many as they pleased, and, afterward, they had a  grand festival in honor of White Feather's triumph over the giants.    All this being pleasantly over, White Feather got his wife to ask her  father's permission to go with him on a visit to his grandfather. The  old chief replied to this application, that a woman must follow her  husband into whatever quarter of the world he may choose to go.    Bidding farewell to all his friends, White Feather placed the plume in  his frontlet, and taking his war-club in his hand, he led the way into  the forest, followed by his faithful wife.
