They've only to keep to their suggestions of  danger.\"    \"For the children to come?\"    \"And perish in the attempt!\" Mrs. Grose slowly got up, and I  scrupulously added: \"Unless, of course, we can prevent!\"    Standing there before me while I kept my seat, she visibly turned things  over. \"Their uncle must do the preventing. He must take them away.\"    \"And who's to make him?\"    She had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish  face. \"You, miss.\"    \"By writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and  niece mad?\"    \"But if they ARE, miss?\"    \"And if I am myself, you mean? That's charming news to be sent him by a  governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.\"    Mrs. Grose considered, following the children again. \"Yes, he do hate  worry. That was the great reason--\"    \"Why those fiends took him in so long? No doubt, though his indifference  must have been awful. As I'm not a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn't take  him in.\"    My companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and  grasped my arm. \"Make him at any rate come to you.\"    I stared. \"To ME?\" I had a sudden fear of what she might do. \"'Him'?\"    \"He ought to BE here--he ought to help.\"    I quickly rose, and I think I must have shown her a queerer face than  ever yet. \"You see me asking him for a visit?\" No, with her eyes on  my face she evidently couldn't. Instead of it even--as a woman reads  another--she could see what I myself saw: his derision, his amusement,  his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone and  for the fine machinery I had set in motion to attract his attention to  my slighted charms. She didn't know--no one knew--how proud I had been  to serve him and to stick to our terms; yet she nonetheless took the  measure, I think, of the warning I now gave her. \"If you should so lose  your head as to appeal to him for me--\"    She was really frightened. \"Yes, miss?\"    \"I would leave, on the spot, both him and you.\"          XIII      It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as  much as ever an effort beyond my strength--offered, in close quarters,  difficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued a  month, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note above  all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the part  of my pupils. It was not, I am as sure today as I was sure then, my mere  infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were aware  of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a manner, for  a long time, the air in which we moved. I don't mean that they had their  tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not one  of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the  unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and  that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected  without a great deal of tacit arrangement. It was as if, at moments, we  were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before which we must stop  short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we perceived to be blind,  closing with a little bang that made us look at each other--for, like  all bangs, it was something louder than we had intended--the doors we  had indiscreetly opened. All roads lead to Rome, and there were times  when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or  subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was  the question of the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in  especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends little children had  lost. There were days when I could have sworn that one of them had, with  a small invisible nudge, said to the other: \"She thinks she'll do it  this time--but she WON'T!\" To \"do it\" would have been to indulge for  instance--and for once in a way--in some direct reference to the lady  who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless  appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and  again treated them; they were in possession of everything that had  ever happened to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my  smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the  cat and the dog at home, as well as many particulars of the eccentric  nature of my father, of the furniture and arrangement of our house, and  of the conversation of the old women of our village. There were things  enough, taking one with another, to chatter about, if one went very fast  and knew by instinct when to go round. They pulled with an art of their  own the strings of my invention and my memory; and nothing else perhaps,  when I thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion  of being watched from under cover. It was in any case over MY life, MY  past, and MY friends alone that we could take anything like our ease--a  state of affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence  to break out into sociable reminders. I was invited--with no visible  connection--to repeat afresh Goody Gosling's celebrated mot or to  confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the  vicarage pony.    It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different  ones that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I  have called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for  me without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done  something toward soothing my nerves. Since the light brush, that second  night on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the foot of  the stair, I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house, that one  had better not have seen. There was many a corner round which I expected  to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way,  would have favored the appearance of Miss Jessel. The summer had turned,  the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon Bly and had blown out  half our lights. The place, with its gray sky and withered garlands,  its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after  the performance--all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly  states of the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable  impressions of the KIND of ministering moment, that brought back to me,  long enough to catch it, the feeling of the medium in which, that June  evening out of doors, I had had my first sight of Quint, and in which,  too, at those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the  window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. I recognized  the signs, the portents--I recognized the moment, the spot. But they  remained unaccompanied and empty, and I continued unmolested; if  unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had, in the  most extraordinary fashion, not declined but deepened. I had said in my  talk with Mrs. Grose on that horrid scene of Flora's by the lake--and  had perplexed her by so saying--that it would from that moment distress  me much more to lose my power than to keep it. I had then expressed what  was vividly in my mind: the truth that, whether the children really  saw or not--since, that is, it was not yet definitely proved--I greatly  preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. I was ready  to know the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly  glimpse of was that my eyes might be sealed just while theirs were  most opened. Well, my eyes WERE sealed, it appeared, at present--a  consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There  was, alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all  my soul had I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the  secret of my pupils.    How can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession? There were  times of our being together when I would have been ready to swear that,  literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed, they  had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was that, had I  not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove  greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken  out. \"They're here, they're here, you little wretches,\" I would have  cried, \"and you can't deny it now!\" The little wretches denied it with  all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just  the crystal depths of which--like the flash of a fish in a stream--the  mockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk into  me still deeper than I knew on the night when, looking out to see either  Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over  whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him--had  straightway, there, turned it on me--the lovely upward look with which,  from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had  played. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion  had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of nerves  produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed me so  that sometimes, at odd moments, I shut myself up audibly to rehearse--it  was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair--the manner in  which I might come to the point. I approached it from one side and the  other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down  in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I  said to myself that I should indeed help them to represent something  infamous, if, by pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little  case of instinctive delicacy as any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#14)"],[1,"on, as a separate,       free and independent people, in some country and climate friendly       to human life and happiness. That any place on the coast of       Africa should answer the latter purpose, I have ever deemed       entirely impossible. And without repeating the other arguments       which have been urged by others, I will appeal to figures only,       which admit no controversy.[57]         There is, I think, a way in which (the removal of the slaves to       another country) can be done; that is by emancipating the       after-born, leaving them, on due compensation, with their       mothers, until their services are worth their maintenance, and       then putting them to industrious occupations until a proper age       for deportation. This was the result of my reflections on the       subject five and forty years ago, and I have never yet been able       to conceive any other practicable plan. It was sketched in the       _Notes of Virginia_. The estimated value of the new-born infant       is so low (say twelve dollars and fifty cents) that it would       probably be yielded by the owner gratis, and would thus reduce       the six hundred millions of dollars, the first head of expense,       to thirty-seven millions and a half; leaving only the expenses of       nourishment while with the mother, and of transportation.[58]         From what fund are these expenses to be furnished? Why not from       that of the lands which have been ceded by the very States now       needing this relief? And ceded on no consideration, for the most       part, but that of the general good of the whole. These cessions       already constitute one-fourth of the States of the Union. It may       be said that these lands have been sold; are not the property of       the citizens composing these States; and the money long ago       received and expended. But an equivalent of lands in the       territories since acquired may be appropriated to that object, or       so much, at least, as may be sufficient; and the object, although       more important to the slave States, is highly so to the others       also, if they were serious in their arguments on the Missouri       question. The slave States, too, if more interested, would also       contribute more by their gratutious liberation, thus taking on       themselves alone the first and heaviest item of expense.[59]    As the proper place for the colonization of emancipated blacks seemed  quite a problem, almost any seemingly desirable place was recommended.  Santo Domingo proved to be attractive after the bloody scenes of the  revolution had passed away.         In the plan sketched in the _Notes on Virginia_, no particular       place of asylum was specified; because it was thought possible       that in the revolutionary state of America, then commenced,       events might open to us some one within practicable distance.       This has now happened. Santo Domingo has become independent, and       with a population of that color only; and if the public papers       are to be credited, their Chief offers to pay their passage, to       receive them as free citizens, and to provide them employment.       This leaves, then, for the general confederacy, no expense but       that of nurture with the mother for a few years, and would call,       of course, for a very moderate appropriation of the vacant       lands.... In this way no violation of private right is       proposed.[60]      III.    In his _Notes on Virginia_ Jefferson discusses all of the phases of  slavery as they appeared to him at that time. He took up the  justification of the institution of slavery among the Romans, the  enslavement of the Indian and the Negroes, the cause of the increase  in slaves, and the effects of the same on both the masters and the  enslaved.[61]         An inhuman practice once prevailed in this country, of making       slaves of the Indians. This practice commenced with the Spaniards       with the first discovery of America.[62]         Under the mild treatment our slaves experience, and their       wholesome, though coarse food, this blot in our country increase       as fast, or faster than the whites.[63]         We know that among the Romans, about the Augustan age especially,       the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that       of the blacks on the continent of America. The two sexes were       confined in separate apartments, because to raise a child cost       the master more than to buy one. Cato, for a very restricted       indulgence to his slaves in this particular, took from them a       certain price. But in this country the slaves multiply as fast as       the free inhabitants.... The same Cato, on a principle of       economy, always sold his sick and superannuated slaves. He gives       it as a standing precept to a master visiting his farm, to sell       his old oxen, old wagons, old tools, old and diseased servants,       and everything else become useless.... The American slaves cannot       enumerate this among the injuries and insults they receive. It       was the common practice to expose in the island AEsculapius, in       the Tiber, diseased slaves whose cure was likely to become       tedious. The Emperor Claudius, by an edict, gave freedom to such       of them as should recover, and first declared that if any person       chose to kill rather than expose them, it should be deemed       homicide. The exposing them is a crime of which no instance has       existed with us; and were it to be followed by death, it would be       punished capitally. We are told of a certain Vedius Pollio, who,       in the presence of Augustus, would have given a slave as food to       his fish for having broken a glass. With the Romans, the regular       method of taking the evidence of their slaves was under torture.       Here it has been thought better never to resort to their       evidence. When a master was murdered, all his slaves, in the same       house, or within hearing, were condemned to death. Here       punishment falls on the guilty only, and as precise proof is       required against his as against a freeman. Yet notwithstanding       these and other discouraging circumstances among the Romans,       their slaves were often their rarest artists. They excelled, too,       in science, insomuch as to be usually employed as tutors to their       master's children. Epictetus, Terence, and Phoedrus, were slaves.       But they were of the race of whites. It is not their condition       then, but nature which has produced the distinction. Whether       further observation will or will not verify the conjecture, that       nature has been less bountiful to them in the endowments of the       head, I believe that in those of the heart she will be found to       have done them justice.[64]         That disposition to theft with which they have been branded, must       be ascribed to their situation, and not to any depravity of the       moral sense. The man in whose favor no laws of property exist,       probably feels himself less bound to respect those made in favor       of others. When arguing for ourselves, we lay it down as a       fundamental, that laws, to be just, must give a reciprocation of       right; that, without this, they are mere arbitrary rules of       conduct, founded in force, and not in conscience; and it is a       problem which I give to the master to solve, whether the       religious precepts against the violation of property were not       framed for him as well as his slave? And whether the slave may       not as justifiably take a little from one who has taken all from       him, as he may slay one who would slay him? That a change in the       relations in which a man is placed should change his ideas of       moral right or wrong, is neither new, nor peculiar to the color       of the blacks. Homer tells us it was so two thousand six hundred       years ago.[65]         The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual       exercise of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting       despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the       other. Our children see this, and learn to imitate it; for man is       an imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in       him. From his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he       sees others do. If a parent could find no motive either in his       philanthropy or his self-love, for restraining the intemperance       of passion towards his slave, it should always be a sufficient       one that his child is present. But, generally, it is not       sufficient. The parent storms, the child looks on, catches the       lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of       smaller slaves, gives a loose to the worst of passions, and thus       nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be       stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a       prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such       circumstances. And with what execrations should the statesman be       loaded, who, permitting one-half the citizens thus to trample on       the rights of the other, transforms those into despots, and these       into enemies, destroys the morals of the one part, and the _amor       patriae_ of the other. For if a slave can have a country in this       world, it must be any other in preference to that in which he is       born to live and labor for another; in which he must lock up the       faculties of his nature, contribute as far as depends on his       inhuman race, or entail his own miserable condition on the       endless generations proceeding from him.[66]         Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have       removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the       people that these liberties are of the gift of God?
