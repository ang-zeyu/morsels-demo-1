Sec. 46. The best Singer in the World continues to study, and persists in  it as much to maintain his Reputation, as he did to acquire it.    Sec. 47. To arrive at that glorious End, every body knows that there is no  other Means than Study; but That does not suffice; it is also necessary  to know in what Manner, and with whose Assistance, we must pursue our  Studies.    Sec. 48.[100] There are now-a-days as many Masters as there are Professors  of Musick in any Kind; every one of them teaches, I don't mean the first  Rudiments only, (That would be an Affront to them;) I am now speaking of  those who take upon them the part of a Legislator in the most finished  part in Singing; and should we then wonder that the good Taste is near  lost, and that the Profession is going to Ruin? So mischievous a  Pretension prevails not only among those, who can barely be said to  sing, but among the meanest instrumental Performers; who, though they  never sung, nor know how to sing, pretend not only to teach, but to  perfect, and find some that are weak enough to be imposed on. But, what  is more, the instrumental Performers of some Ability imagine that the  beautiful Graces and Flourishes, with their nimble Fingers, will have  the same Effect when executed with the Voice; but it will not do[101]. I  should be the first to condemn the magisterial Liberty I take, were it  meant to give Offence to such Singers and instrumental Performers of  Worth, who know how to sing, perform, and instruct; but my Correction  aims no farther than to the Petulancy of those that have no Capacity,  with these few Words, _Age quod agis_; which (for those who do not  understand _Latin_) is as much as to say,-----Do You mind your _Sol-fa_;  and You, your Instrument.    Sec. 49. If sometimes it does happen, that an indifferent Master should  make an excellent Disciple, it is then incontestable, that the Gift of  Nature in the Student is superior to the Sufficiency of the Instructor:  and it is not to be wonder'd at, for, if from time to time, even great  Masters were not outdone, most of the finest Arts would have sunk before  now.    Sec. 50. It may seem to many, that every perfect Singer must also be a  perfect Instructor, but it is not so; for his Qualifications (though  ever so great) are insufficient, if he cannot communicate his  Sentiments with Ease, and in a Method adapted to the Ability of the  Scholar; if he has not some Notion of Composition, and a manner of  instructing, which may seem rather an Entertainment than a Lesson; with  the happy Talent to shew the Ability of the Singer to Advantage, and  conceal his Imperfections; which are the principal and most necessary  Instructions.    Sec. 51. A Master, that is possessed of the abovementioned Qualifications,  is capable of Teaching; with them he will raise a Desire to study; will  correct Errors with a Reason; and by Examples incite a Taste to imitate  him.    Sec. 52. He knows, that a Deficiency of Ornaments displeases as much as the  too great Abundance of them; that a Singer makes one languid and dull  with too little, and cloys one with too much; but, of the two, he will  dislike the former most, though it gives less Offence, the latter being  easier to be amended.    Sec. 53. He will have no Manner of Esteem for those who have no other  Graces than gradual _Divisions_[102]; and will tell you, Embellishments  of this Sort are only fit for Beginners.    Sec. 54. He will have as little Esteem for those who think to make their  Auditors faint away, with their Transition from the sharp Third to the  Flat.    Sec. 55. He'll tell you, that a Singer is lazy, who on the Stage, from  Night to Night, teaches the Audience all his Songs; who, by hearing them  always without the least Variation, have no Difficulty to learn them by  Heart.    Sec. 56. He will be affrighted at the Rashness of one that launches out,  with little Practice, and less Study; lest venturing too far, he should  be in great Danger of losing himself.    Sec. 57. He will not praise one that presumes to sing two Parts in three of  an Opera, promising himself never to be tiresome, as if that divine  Privilege of always pleasing were allowed him here below. Such a one  does not know the first Principle of musical Politicks; but Time will  teach it him. He, that sings little and well, sings very well.    Sec. 58. He will laugh at those who imagine to satisfy the Publick with the  Magnificence of their Habits, without reflecting, that Merit and  Ignorance are equally aggrandized by Pomp. The Singers, that have  nothing but the outward Appearance, pay that Debt to the Eyes, which  they owe to the Ears.    Sec. 59. He will nauseate the new-invented Stile of those who provoke the  innocent Notes with coarse Startings of the Voice. A disagreeable  Defect; however, being brought from[103] beyond the _Alps_, it passes  for a _modern_ Rarity.    Sec. 60. He will be astonished at this bewitched Age, in which so many are  paid so well for singing ill. The _Moderns_ would not be pleas'd to be  put in Mind, that, twenty Years ago, indifferent Singers had but mean  Parts allotted them, even in the second-rate Theatres; whereas at  present, those, who are taught like Parrots, heap up Treasures beyond  what the Singers of the first Degree then did.[104]    Sec. 61. He will condemn the Ignorance of the Men most, they being more  obliged to study than the Women.    Sec. 62. He will not bear with one who imitates the Women, even in  sacrificing the Time, in order to acquire the Title of _Modern_.    Sec. 63. He will marvel at that[105] Singer, who, having a good Knowledge  of Time, yet does not make use of it, for want of having apply'd himself  to the Study of Composition, or to accompany himself. His Mistake makes  him think that, to be eminent, it suffices to sing at Sight; and does  not perceive that the greatest Difficulty, and the whole Beauty of the  Profession consists in what he is ignorant of; he wants that Art which  teaches to anticipate the Time, knowing where to lose it again; and,  which is still more charming, to know how to lose it, in order to  recover it again; which are the Advantages of such as understand  Composition, and have the best Taste.    Sec. 64. He will be displeased at the Presumption of a Singer who gets the  Words of the most wanton _Airs_ of the Theatre rendered into _Latin_,  that he may sing them with Applause in the[106] Church; as if there  were no Manner of Difference between the Stile of the one and the other;  and, as if the Scraps of the Stage were fit to offer to the Deity.    Sec. 65. What will he not say of him who has found out the prodigious Art  of Singing like a _Cricket_? Who could have ever imagin'd, before the  Introduction of the _Mode_, that ten or a dozen Quavers in a Row could  be trundled along one after the other, with a Sort of _Tremor_, of the  Voice, which for some time past has gone under the name of _Mordente  Fresco_?[107]    Sec. 66. He will have a still greater Detestation for the Invention of  Laughing in Singing, or that screaming like a Hen when she is laying her  Egg. Will there not be some other little Animal worth their Imitation,  in order to make the Profession more and more ridiculous?    Sec. 67. He will disapprove the malicious Custom of a Singer in Repute,  who talks and laughs on the Stage with his Companions, to induce the  Publick to believe that such a Singer, who appears the first time on the  Stage, does not deserve his Attention; when in reality he is afraid of,  or envies, his gaining Applause.    Sec. 68. He cannot endure the Vanity of that Singer, who, full of himself  from the little he has learned, is so taken with his own Performance,  that he seems falling into an Extasy; pretending to impose Silence and  create Wonder, as if his first Note said to the Audience, _Hear and  Die_: But they, unwilling to die, chuse not to hear him, talk loud, and  perhaps not much to his Advantage. At his second Air the Noise  encreases, and still encreasing, he looks upon it as a manifest Injury  done him; and, instead of correcting his conceited Pride by Study, he  curses the deprav'd Taste of that Nation that does not esteem him,  menacing never to return again; and thus the vain Wretch comforts  himself.    Sec. 69. He will laugh at one who will not act unless he has the Choice of  the Drama, and a Composer to his liking; with this additional Condition,  not to sing in Company with such a Man, or without such a Woman.    Sec. 70. With the like Derision, he will observe some others, who with an  Humility worse than Pride, go from one Box to another, gathering Praises  from the most illustrious Persons, under a Pretence of a most profound  Obsequiousness, and become in every Representation more and more  familiar. Humility and Modesty are most beautiful Virtues; but if they  are not accompanied with a little Decorum, they have some Resemblance to  Hypocrisy.    Sec. 71. He will have no great Opinion of one, who is not satisfied with  his Part, and never learns it; of one, who never sings in an Opera  without thrusting in one _Air_ which he always carries in his Pocket; of  one, who bribes the Composer to give him an _Air_ that was intended for  another; of one, who takes Pains about Trifles, and neglects Things of  Importance; of one, who, by procuring undeserved Recommendations, makes  himself and his Patron ridiculous; of one, who does not sustain his  Voice, out of Aversion to the _Pathetick_; of one, who gallops to follow  the _Mode_; and of all the bad Singers, who, not knowing what's good,  court the _Mode_ to learn its Defects.    Sec. 72. To sum up all, he will call none a Singer of Merit, but him who is  correct; and who executes with a Variety of Graces of his own, which his  Skill inspires him with unpremeditately; knowing, that a Professor of  Eminence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#14)"],[1,"from a transport  just below the scene of action, had begun to collect his men at  Sable Island, twelve miles behind Fort St. Philip, long before  Farragut's messenger could reach him by way of the Quarantine Bayou.  From Sable Island the troops were taken by the transports to a  point on the Mississippi five miles above Fort St. Philip.    After a well-earned rest the whole fleet moved up to New Orleans  on the twenty-fifth, turning the city's lines five miles downstream  without the loss of a man, for the simple reason that these had  been built only to resist an army, and so lay with flanks entirely  open to a fleet. General Lovell (the able commander who had so  often warned the Confederate Government of the danger from the sea)  at once evacuated the defenseless city. The best of the younger men  were away with the armies. The best of the older men were too few for  the storm. And so pandemonium broke loose. Burning boats, blazing  cotton, and a howling mob greeted Farragut's arrival. But after the  forts (now completely cut off from their base) had surrendered  on the twenty-eighth a landing party from the fleet soon brought  the mob to its senses by planting howitzers in the streets and  lowering the Confederate colors over the city hall. On the first  of May a garrison of Federal troops took charge of New Orleans  and kept it till the war was over.      New Orleans was a most pregnant Federal victory; for it established a  Union base at the great strategic point where sea-power and land-power  could meet most effectively in Mississippi waters.    But it was followed by a perfect anti-climax; for the Federal  Government, having planned a naval concentration at Vicksburg,  determined to put the plan in operation; though all the naval and  military means concerned made such a plan impossible of execution in  1862. Amphibious forces--fleets and armies combined--were essential.  There was no use in parading up and down the river, however  triumphantly, so long as the force employed could only hold the part  of the channel within actual range of its guns. The Confederates  could be driven off the Mississippi at any given point. But there  was nothing to prevent them from coming back again when once the  ships had passed. An army to seize and hold strategic points ashore  was absolutely indispensable. Then, and only then, Farragut's long  line of communication with his base at New Orleans would be safe,  and the land in which the Mississippi was the principal highway  could itself be conquered.    \"If the Mississippi expedition from Cairo shall not have descended  the river, you will take advantage of the panic to push a strong  force up the river to take all their defenses in rear.\" These were  the orders Farragut had to obey if he succeeded in taking New Orleans.  They were soon reinforced by this reminder: \"The only anxiety we feel  is to know if you have followed up your instructions and pushed a  strong force up the river to meet the Western flotilla.\" Farragut  therefore felt bound to obey and do all that could be done to carry  on a quite impossible campaign. So, with a useless landing party  of only fifteen hundred troops, he pushed up to Vicksburg, four  hundred miles above New Orleans. The nearest Federal army had been  halted by the Confederate defenses above Memphis, another four  hundred higher still.    There were several reasons why Farragut should not have gone up.  His big ships would certainly be stranded if he went up and waited  for the army to come down; moreover, when stranded, these ships  would be captured while waiting, because both banks were swarming  with vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. Then, such a disaster  would more than offset the triumph of New Orleans by still further  depressing Federal morale at a time when the Federal arms were  doing none too well near Washington. Finally, all the force that  was being worse than wasted up the Mississippi might have been  turned against Mobile, which, at that time, was much weaker than  the defenses Farragut had already overcome. But the people of the  North were clamorous for more victories along the line to which  the press had drawn their gaze. So the Government ordered the fleet  to carry on this impossible campaign.    Farragut did his best. Within a month of passing the forts he had  not only captured New Orleans and repaired the many serious damages  suffered by his fleet but had captured Baton Rouge, and taken even  his biggest ships to Vicksburg, five hundred miles from the Gulf,  against a continuous current, and right through the heart of a  hostile land. Finding that there were thirty thousand Confederates  in, near, or within a day of Vicksburg he and General Thomas Williams  agreed that nothing could be done with the fifteen hundred troops  which formed the only landing party. Sickness and casualties had  reduced the ships' companies; so there were not even a few seamen  to spare as reinforcements for these fifteen hundred soldiers, whom  Butler had sent, under Williams, with the fleet. Then Farragut  turned back, his stores running dangerously short owing to the  enormous difficulties of keeping open his long, precarious line of  communications. \"I arrived in New Orleans with five or six days'  provisions and one anchor, and am now trying to procure others....  Fighting is nothing to the evils of the river--getting on shore,  running foul of one another, losing anchors, etc.\" In a confidential  letter home he is still more outspoken. \"They will keep us in this  river till the vessels break down and all the little reputation  we have made has evaporated. The Government appears to think that  we can do anything. They expect me to navigate the Mississippi  nine hundred miles in the face of batteries, ironclad rams, etc.;  and yet with all the ironclad vessels they have North they could  not get to Norfolk or Richmond.\"    Back from Washington came still more urgent orders to join the  Mississippi flotilla which was coming down to Vicksburg from the  north under Flag Officer Charles H. Davis. So once more the fleet  worked its laboriously wasteful way up to Vicksburg, where it passed  the forts with the help of Porter's flotilla of mortar-boats on  the twenty-eighth of June and joined Davis on the first of July.  There, in useless danger, the joint forces lay till the fifteenth,  the day on which Grant's own \"most anxious period of the war\" began  on the Memphis-Corinth line, four hundred miles above.    Farragut, getting very anxious about the shoaling of the water,  was then preparing to run down when he heard firing in the Yazoo,  a tributary that joined the Mississippi four miles higher up. This  came from a fight between one of his reconnoitering gunboats, the  _Carondelet_, and the _Arkansas_, an ironclad Confederate ram that  would have been very dangerous indeed if her miserable engines had  been able to give her any speed. She was beating the _Carondelet_,  but getting her smoke-stack so badly holed that her speed dropped  down to one knot, which scarcely gave her steerage way and made  her unable to ram. Firing hard she ran the gauntlet of both fleets  and took refuge under the Vicksburg bluffs, whence she might run  out and ram the Union vessels below. Farragut therefore ran down  himself, hoping to smash her by successive broadsides in passing.  But the difficulties of the passage wasted the daylight, so that  he had to run by at night. She therefore survived his attack, and  went downstream to join the Confederates against Baton Rouge. But  her engines gave way before she got there; and she had to be blown  up.    Farragut was back at New Orleans before the end of July. On the  fifth of August the Confederates made their attack on Baton Rouge;  but were beaten back by the Union garrison aided by three of Farragut's  gunboats and two larger vessels from Davis's command. The losses  were not very severe on either side; but the Union lost a leader  of really magnificent promise in its commanding general, Thomas  Williams, a great-hearted, cool-headed man and most accomplished  officer. The garrison of Baton Rouge, being too small and sickly  and exposed, was withdrawn to New Orleans a few days later.    Then Farragut at last returned to the Gulf blockade. Davis went back  up the river, where he was succeeded by D. D. Porter in October.  And the Confederates, warned of what was coming, made Port Hudson  and Vicksburg as strong as they could. Vicksburg was now the only  point they held on the Mississippi where there were rails on both  sides; and the Red River, flowing in from the West between Vicksburg  and Port Hudson, was the only good line of communication connecting  them with Texas, whence so much of their meat was obtained.    For three months Farragut directed the Gulf blockade from Pensacola,  where, on the day of his arrival, the twentieth of August, he was the  first American to hoist an admiral's flag. The rank of rear-admiral  in the United States Navy had been created on the previous sixteenth  of July; and Farragut was the senior of the first three officers  upon whom it was conferred.    Farragut became the ranking admiral just when the United States  Navy was having its hardest struggle to do its fivefold duty well.  There was commerce protection on the high seas, blockade along the  coast, coöperation with the army on salt water and on fresh, and  of course the destruction of the nascent Confederate forces afloat.  But perhaps a knottier problem than any part of its combatant duty  was how to manage, in the very midst of war, that rapid expansion  of its own strength for which no government had let it prepare in  time of peace. During this year the number of vessels in commission  grew from 264 to 427. Yet such a form of expansion was much simpler  than that of the enlisted men; and the expansion of even the most  highly trained enlisted personnel was very much simpler than the"]]]
