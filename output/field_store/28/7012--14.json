Cotton wool is used as a stuffing, its  surface being usually covered over with muslin, but this again would  not stand much wear of any kind, and so could only be used under certain  conditions.    [Illustration: Fig. 103.]    Another good method is to couch down a hank of threads of fine cotton or  perhaps wool as illustrated in fig. 103. For raised lines there is a  special kind of string procurable that can be couched to the ground  material at the required places. The padding, whatever it may be  composed of, should be as nearly as possible of the same colour as the  surface layer, in view of any after wear and tear misplacing the  threads.    [Illustration: Fig. 104.]    The top layer of underlay must lie in direction contrary to the surface  embroidery stitching, which is very often some form of satin stitch  taken from side to side over the padding. Instead of going through the  material it can be fixed on each side with a couching stitch, as in  fig. 104. A stronger way than these would be that shown in fig. 129.  Buttonhole is a good stitch for working over a padding; it would be  worked solidly in the manner described and illustrated on page 117, but  taken, as there shown, over a padding instead of over a flat surface.      DARNING    There is a most practical sound about darning; it can, however, be made  good use of in embroidery as well as in plain needlework. There are two  rather different kinds in use; in both the stitch is a running one and  done in much the same way that a thin place would be darned in mending.    One kind of darning is rather popular at the present moment, and  examples of it may be familiar; it is a large, bold kind of work, often  carried out with a coarse twisted silk. Upon the background, the lines  of stitching usually run straight across or up and down, in the pattern,  they radiate according to the shape of the form to be filled. The entire  material is covered one way or another by the running stitches, and  just one thread of the ground fabric is picked up where necessary at  irregular intervals; a loosely woven linen is often chosen for working  upon, one in which it is easy to pick up the single thread. Gradation of  colour can easily be introduced; the design chosen is most frequently  some kind of conventional flower and leafy scroll. This method of  embroidery is seen to best advantage when used upon large surfaces.    The second kind is called pattern darning; in it the stitches are picked  up in some regular order, so that they form various geometrical patterns  over the surface. It is worked by counting the threads of the fine linen  ground and picking up a single thread or more in some regular sequence.  The threads are run in parallel lines close together, either  horizontally or vertically, so as to take advantage of the web of the  fabric. The work is particularly pretty and not difficult, requiring  only patience and good eyesight. Fig. 105 gives some simple examples of  the work--The first is a chevron pattern, formed by picking up one  thread and leaving about five each time; each succeeding row moves a  step forward or backward as required to carry out the pattern. In the  second example the darning is taken two ways of the material; in the  centre, where it meets and crosses, it entirely covers the ground. A  different colour might be used for each direction, which would look very  well at the crossing in the centre. The four corners are filled up with  a chequer darn; this each time picks up as much material as it leaves.  The third example shows the darning stitch forming a diamond pattern.  Samplers, dated early XIXth century, may be seen entirely filled with  these pattern darns; they are covered with most intricate and beautiful  sample squares showing various patterns in darning, and were possibly  done in order to learn how to repair damask table linen. In a collection  of early Egyptian work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, there is some  pattern darning, dated VIth to IXth century, A.D., which proves it to be  a very early method of embroidering.    [Illustration: Fig. 105.]    [Illustration: Fig. 106.]    This pattern darning, however, is so pretty that it is often possible to  make use of it in embroidery work for all kinds of purposes. It makes a  very good background if there is sufficient space to show the pattern,  if there is not, the irregular darning might be used instead, for it  would in that case be just as good and much quicker to work. To  pattern-darn the ground with the ornament upon it left in the plain  material, perhaps not worked upon at all, is a very effective method of  carrying out a design, see fig. 106 for example. Again it might very  well be used for the conventional carrying out of draperies in the same  way as in _point couche rentre ou retire_.[6] The draperies on the  figure in the frontispiece could easily be carried out with silk thread  in the darning stitch, in fact this method of decoration more closely  resembles the early couching than any other; it is not quite as  satisfactory because the single threads of the background that are  picked up prevent the ground showing nothing but silk. Bands of this  work may be seen ornamenting needle books or work cases; it shows to  best advantage when worked finely with floss or filosel silk, the coarse  twisted silks are too thick for the purpose.      OPEN WORK FILLINGS    [Illustration: Fig. 107.]    [Illustration: Fig. 108.]    Patterns can be carried out in line, they can be worked quite solidly,  and there is a method that lies between these two known as open filling.  The open and solid fillings are often used together in the same piece of  work; examples of this can be seen on the XVIIth century wool-work  curtains, the large scrolling leaves are sometimes partly worked openly  and a portion, possibly reflexed, filled in with solid stitches in  gradating colour; see for an example Plate VIII. This has a very good  effect, it prevents the work looking too heavy, shows up the form more  clearly, and allows of more variety in the stitching. With open fillings  the outline surrounding them must always be some firm decided line, such  as is made by a band of satin or long and short stitch, or, in the case  of larger forms, by several rows of different line stitches worked  closely together, one inside the other, most likely in different shades  of colour. A filling of open work can be carried out in a variety of  ways; it may be a decorated trellis, a regular dotting of some kind, or  some geometrical pattern in outline, or some light stitch such as an  open buttonhole (see fig. 107), which would be treated each as a  diapering over the form to be filled. It does not much matter what the  filling is as long as it is dispersed pretty regularly over the space,  giving the effect at a little distance of a light pervading tone, and  when examined closely exhibiting an interesting small pattern. The open  filling method can be used entirely throughout a design with very pretty  effect; an example of this may be seen on an embroidered coverlet and  pillow case in the Victoria and Albert Museum.[7] The pattern, composed  of vine leaves and grapes, is carried out in dark brown silk on a linen  ground, the leaves being all outlined with satin stitch. There is  wonderful variety in the patterns, no two alike, which form the open  fillings of the leaves; this makes them most interesting to examine, and  is evidence of enthusiasm in their designing. Fig. 108, a leaf taken  from this specimen, shows one method of filling a form with open  work.[8] Fig. 109 shows a collection of patterns taken from the same  piece of embroidery. It will be observed that small stitches of the same  length compose the pattern, which can be designed upon squared paper and  easily copied on to the linen ground by always picking up the same  number of threads. To look well these little forms must be accurately  worked, and they or similar kinds can be used upon flowers, leaves,  beasts, draperies, or anything else quite indiscriminately. Fig. 110,  from a cap in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a drawing showing the  same kind of open filling in use upon a bird.[9]    [Illustration: Fig. 109.]    [Illustration: Fig. 110.]    A quicker way of carrying out these geometrical fillings is by using  such forms as a lattice and throwing the lines from side to side  across the shape to be filled, fixing them down, where they cross each  other, with couching stitches; the interstices left between the threads  can be filled in with little stars, crosses, or dots (see fig. 111).  Buttonhole stitch, if made use of as an open filling, would be taken in  lines straight across a form, the stitches being worked possibly two or  three closely together and then a space, and so on.    [Illustration: Fig. 111.]    Fig. 112 suggests another method of lightly filling a leaf with a  conventional veining and dotting. There is no limit to the variety which  can be obtained in this method of working.    [Illustration: Fig. 112.]    Open fillings are effective for use upon any work that is intended to be  seen with a light at the back; they make very decorative the various  forms they fill, in such things as muslin window blinds, curtains, fire  screens, whether hand screens or the larger type. For articles of this  kind the patterns should be rather more solid and less lined in  character; fig. 113, taken from a window blind exhibited in the Victoria  and Albert Museum, exemplifies what is meant; most of the patterns  illustrated in fig. 100 could be treated in a more solid manner if  necessary, and would look equally well that way. When working upon  transparent grounds special care must be taken with the reverse side as  well as with the surface, for the work to be practically alike upon both  sides; there must be no threads running from one form to another nor any  visible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#14)"],[1,"gh, no doubt, in the watches of the night it will  occur to him that _I_ think he has, and I may expect explanations  to-morrow.    I must close this letter: it has to go by the late coach.      LETTER III                _Dec. 25, '37_.    MY DEAR ROBERT,--This is a curious letter to be writing on Christmas  Day, and yet after all there is nothing much in it. Or there may  be--you shall be the judge. At least, nothing decisive. The Bow  Street men practically say that they have no clue. The length of time  and the weather conditions have made all tracks so faint as to be  quite useless: nothing that belonged to the dead man--I'm afraid no  other word will do--has been picked up.    As I expected, Mr. Bowman was uneasy in his mind this morning; quite  early I heard him holding forth in a very distinct voice--purposely  so, I thought--to the Bow Street officers in the bar, as to the loss  that the town had sustained in their Rector, and as to the necessity  of leaving no stone unturned (he was very great on this phrase) in  order to come at the truth. I suspect him of being an orator of repute  at convivial meetings.    When I was at breakfast he came to wait on me, and took an opportunity  when handing a muffin to say in a low tone, \"I 'ope, sir, you reconize  as my feelings towards your relative is not actuated by any taint of  what you may call melignity--you can leave the room, Eliza, I will see  the gentleman 'as all he requires with my own hands--I ask your  pardon, sir, but you must be well aware a man is not always master of  himself: and when that man has been 'urt in his mind by the  application of expressions which I will go so far as to say 'ad not  ought to have been made use of (his voice was rising all this time and  his face growing redder); no, sir; and 'ere, if you will permit of it,  I should like to explain to you in a very few words the exact state of  the bone of contention. This cask--I might more truly call it a  firkin--of beer--\"    I felt it was time to interpose, and said that I did not see that it  would help us very much to go into that matter in detail. Mr. Bowman  acquiesced, and resumed more calmly:    \"Well, sir, I bow to your ruling, and as you say, be that here or be  it there, it don't contribute a great deal, perhaps, to the present  question. All I wish you to understand is that I am prepared as you  are yourself to lend every hand to the business we have afore us,  and--as I took the opportunity to say as much to the Orficers not  three-quarters of an hour ago--to leave no stone unturned as may throw  even a spark of light on this painful matter.\"    In fact, Mr. Bowman did accompany us on our exploration, but though I  am sure his genuine wish was to be helpful, I am afraid he did not  contribute to the serious side of it. He appeared to be under the  impression that we were likely to meet either Uncle Henry or the  person responsible for his disappearance, walking about the  fields--and did a great deal of shading his eyes with his hand and  calling our attention, by pointing with his stick, to distant cattle  and labourers. He held several long conversations with old women whom  we met, and was very strict and severe in his manner--but on each  occasion returned to our party saying, \"Well, I find she don't seem to  'ave no connexion with this sad affair. I think you may take it from  me, sir, as there's little or no light to be looked for from that  quarter; not without she's keeping somethink back intentional.\"    We gained no appreciable result, as I told you at starting; the Bow  Street men have left the town, whether for London or not, I am not  sure.    This evening I had company in the shape of a bagman, a smartish  fellow. He knew what was going forward, but though he has been on the  roads for some days about here, he had nothing to tell of suspicious  characters--tramps, wandering sailors or gipsies. He was very full of  a capital Punch and Judy Show he had seen this same day at W----, and  asked if it had been here yet, and advised me by no means to miss it  if it does come. The best Punch and the best Toby dog, he said, he had  ever come across. Toby dogs, you know, are the last new thing in the  shows. I have only seen one myself, but before long all the men will  have them.    Now why, you will want to know, do I trouble to write all this to you?  I am obliged to do it, because it has something to do with another  absurd trifle (as you will inevitably say), which in my present state  of rather unquiet fancy--nothing more, perhaps--I have to put down. It  is a dream, sir, which I am going to record, and I must say it is one  of the oddest I have had. Is there anything in it beyond what the  bagman's talk and Uncle Henry's disappearance could have suggested?  You, I repeat, shall judge: I am not in a sufficiently cool and  judicial frame to do so.    It began with what I can only describe as a pulling aside of curtains:  and I found myself seated in a place--I don't know whether in doors or  out. There were people--only a few--on either side of me, but I did  not recognize them, or indeed think much about them. They never spoke,  but, so far as I remember, were all grave and pale-faced and looked  fixedly before them. Facing me there was a Punch and Judy Show,  perhaps rather larger than the ordinary ones, painted with black  figures on a reddish-yellow ground. Behind it and on each side was  only darkness, but in front there was a sufficiency of light. I was  \"strung up\" to a high degree of expectation and listened every moment  to hear the panpipes and the Roo-too-too-it. Instead of that there  came suddenly an enormous--I can use no other word--an enormous single  toll of a bell, I don't know from how far off--somewhere behind. The  little curtain flew up and the drama began.    I believe someone once tried to re-write Punch as a serious tragedy;  but whoever he may have been, this performance would have suited him  exactly. There was something Satanic about the hero. He varied his  methods of attack: for some of his victims he lay in wait, and to see  his horrible face--it was yellowish white, I may remark--peering round  the wings made me think of the Vampyre in Fuseli's foul sketch. To  others he was polite and carneying--particularly to the unfortunate  alien who can only say _Shallabalah_--though what Punch said I never  could catch. But with all of them I came to dread the moment of death.  The crack of the stick on their skulls, which in the ordinary way  delights me, had here a crushing sound as if the bone was giving way,  and the victims quivered and kicked as they lay. The baby--it sounds  more ridiculous as I go on--the baby, I am sure, was alive. Punch  wrung its neck, and if the choke or squeak which it gave were not  real, I know nothing of reality.    The stage got perceptibly darker as each crime was consummated, and at  last there was one murder which was done quite in the dark, so that I  could see nothing of the victim, and took some time to effect. It was  accompanied by hard breathing and horrid muffled sounds, and after it  Punch came and sat on the foot-board and fanned himself and looked at  his shoes, which were bloody, and hung his head on one side, and  sniggered in so deadly a fashion that I saw some of those beside me  cover their faces, and I would gladly have done the same. But in the  meantime the scene behind Punch was clearing, and showed, not the  usual house front, but something more ambitious--a grove of trees and  the gentle slope of a hill, with a very natural--in fact, I should say  a real--moon shining on it. Over this there rose slowly an object  which I soon perceived to be a human figure with something peculiar  about the head--what, I was unable at first to see. It did not stand  on its feet, but began creeping or dragging itself across the middle  distance towards Punch, who still sat back to it; and by this time, I  may remark (though it did not occur to me at the moment) that all  pretence of this being a puppet show had vanished. Punch was still  Punch, it is true, but, like the others, was in some sense a live  creature, and both moved themselves at their own will.    When I next glanced at him he was sitting in malignant reflection; but  in another instant something seemed to attract his attention, and he  first sat up sharply and then turned round, and evidently caught sight  of the person that was approaching him and was in fact now very near.  Then, indeed, did he show unmistakable signs of terror: catching up  his stick, he rushed towards the wood, only just eluding the arm of  his pursuer, which was suddenly flung out to intercept him. It was  with a revulsion which I cannot easily express that I now saw more or  less clearly what this pursuer was like. He was a sturdy figure clad  in black, and, as I thought, wearing bands: his head was covered with  a whitish bag.    The chase which now began lasted I do not know how long, now among the  trees, now along the slope of the field, sometimes both figures  disappearing wholly for a few seconds, and only some uncertain sounds  letting one know that they were still afoot. At length there came a  moment when Punch, evidently exhausted, staggered in from the left and  threw himself down among the trees. His pursuer was not long after  him, and came looking uncertainly from side to side. Then, catching  sight of the figure on the ground, he too threw himself down--his back  was turned to the audience--with a swift motion twitched the covering  from his head, and thrust his face into that of Punch. Everything on  the instant grew dark.    There was one long, loud, shuddering scream, and I awoke to find  myself looking straight into the face of--what in all the world do you  think?--but a large owl, which was seated on my window-sill  immediately opposite my bed-foot, holding up its wings like two  shrouded arms. I caught the fierce glance of its yellow eyes,"]]]
