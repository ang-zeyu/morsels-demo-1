Aramis advanced and bowed: \"In order to serve the son as I served the  father.\"    D'Artagnan looked very narrowly at Aramis while he uttered these words,  which displayed so much true respect, so much warm devotion, such entire  frankness and sincerity, that even he, D'Artagnan, the eternal doubter,  he, the almost infallible in judgment, was deceived by it. \"A man who  lies cannot speak in such a tone as that,\" he said.    Louis was overcome by it. \"In that case,\" he said to Fouquet, who  anxiously awaited the result of this proof, \"the cardinal's hat is  promised. Monsieur d'Herblay, I pledge you my honor that the first  promotion shall be yours. Thank M. Fouquet for it.\" Colbert overheard  these words; they stung him to the quick, and he left the salon  abruptly. \"And you, Monsieur du Vallon,\" said the king, \"what have you  to ask? I am truly pleased to have it in my power to acknowledge the  services of those who were faithful to my father.\"    \"Sire--\" began Porthos, but he was unable to proceed with what he was  going to say.    \"Sire,\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"this worthy gentleman is utterly  overpowered by your majesty's presence, he who so valiantly sustained  the looks and the fire of a thousand foes. But, knowing what his  thoughts are, I--who am more accustomed to gaze upon the sun--can  translate them: he needs nothing, absolutely nothing; his sole desire  is to have the happiness of gazing upon your majesty for a quarter of an  hour.\"    \"You shall sup with me this evening,\" said the king, saluting Porthos  with a gracious smile.    Porthos became crimson from delight and pride. The king dismissed him,  and D'Artagnan pushed him into the adjoining apartment, after he had  embraced him warmly.    \"Sit next to me at table,\" said Porthos in his ear.    \"Yes, my friend.\"    \"Aramis is annoyed with me, I think.\"    \"Aramis has never liked you so much as he does now. Fancy, it was I who  was the means of his getting the cardinal's hat.\"    \"Of course,\" said Porthos. \"By the by, does the king like his guests to  eat much at his table?\"    \"It is a compliment to himself if you do,\" said D'Artagnan, \"for he  himself possesses a royal appetite.\"        Chapter IX. Explanations.    Aramis cleverly managed to effect a diversion for the purpose of finding  D'Artagnan and Porthos. He came up to the latter, behind one of the  columns, and, as he pressed his hand, said, \"So you have escaped from my  prison?\"    \"Do not scold him,\" said D'Artagnan; \"it was I, dear Aramis, who set him  free.\"    \"Ah! my friend,\" replied Aramis, looking at Porthos, \"could you not have  waited with a little more patience?\"    D'Artagnan came to the assistance of Porthos, who already began to  breathe hard, in sore perplexity.    \"You see, you members of the Church are great politicians; we mere  soldiers come at once to the point. The facts are these: I went to pay  Baisemeaux a visit--\"    Aramis pricked up his ears at this announcement.    \"Stay!\" said Porthos; \"you make me remember that I have a letter from  Baisemeaux for you, Aramis.\" And Porthos held out the bishop the letter  we have already seen. Aramis begged to be allowed to read it, and read  it without D'Artagnan feeling in the slightest degree embarrassed by  the circumstance that he was so well acquainted with the contents of it.  Besides, Aramis's face was so impenetrable, that D'Artagnan could not  but admire him more than ever; after he had read it, he put the letter  into his pocket with the calmest possible air.    \"You were saying, captain?\" he observed.    \"I was saying,\" continued the musketeer, \"that I had gone to pay  Baisemeaux a visit on his majesty's service.\"    \"On his majesty's service?\" said Aramis.    \"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and, naturally enough, we talked about you and  our friends. I must say that Baisemeaux received me coldly; so I soon  took my leave of him. As I was returning, a soldier accosted me, and  said (no doubt as he recognized me, notwithstanding I was in private  clothes), 'Captain, will you be good enough to read me the name written  on this envelope?' and I read, 'To Monsieur du Vallon, at M. Fouquet's  house, Saint-Mande.' The deuce, I said to myself, Porthos has not  returned, then, as I fancied, to Bell-Isle, or to Pierrefonds, but is  at M. Fouquet's house, at Saint-Mande; and as M. Fouquet is not at  Saint-Mande, Porthos must be quite alone, or, at all events, with  Aramis; I will go and see Porthos, and I accordingly went to see  Porthos.\"    \"Very good,\" said Aramis, thoughtfully.    \"You never told me that,\" said Porthos.    \"I had no time, my friend.\"    \"And you brought back Porthos with you to Fontainebleau?\"    \"Yes, to Planchet's house.\"    \"Does Planchet live at Fontainebleau?\" inquired Aramis.    \"Yes, near the cemetery,\" said Porthos, thoughtlessly.    \"What do you mean by 'near the cemetery?'\" said Aramis, suspiciously.    \"Come,\" thought the musketeer, \"since there is to be a squabble, let us  take advantage of it.\"    \"Yes, the cemetery,\" said Porthos. \"Planchet is a very excellent fellow,  who makes very excellent preserves; but his house has windows which look  out upon the cemetery. And a confoundedly melancholy prospect it is! So  this morning--\"    \"This morning?\" said Aramis, more and more excited.    D'Artagnan turned his back to them, and walked to the window, where he  began to play a march upon one of the panes of glass.    \"Yes, this morning we saw a man buried there.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Very depressing, was it not? I should never be able to live in a house  where burials can always be seen from the window. D'Artagnan, on the  contrary, seems to like it very much.\"    \"So D'Artagnan saw it as well?\"    \"Not simply _saw_ it; he literally never took his eyes off the whole  time.\"    Aramis started, and turned to look at the musketeer, but the latter was  engaged in earnest conversation with Saint-Aignan. Aramis continued to  question Porthos, and when he had squeezed all the juice out of this  enormous lemon, he threw the peel aside. He turned towards his friend  D'Artagnan, and clapping him on the shoulder, when Saint-Aignan had left  him, the king's supper having been announced, said, \"D'Artagnan.\"    \"Yes, my dear fellow,\" he replied.    \"We do not sup with his majesty, I believe?\"    \"Well?--_we_ do.\"    \"Can you give me ten minutes' conversation?\"    \"Twenty, if you like. His majesty will take quite that time to get  properly seated at table.\"    \"Where shall we talk, then?\"    \"Here, upon these seats if you like; the king has left, we can sit down,  and the apartment is empty.\"    \"Let us sit down, then.\"    They sat down, and Aramis took one of D'Artagnan's hands in his.    \"Tell me, candidly, my dear friend, whether you have not counseled  Porthos to distrust me a little?\"    \"I admit, I have, but not as you understand it. I saw that Porthos was  bored to death, and I wished, by presenting him to the king, to do for  him, and for you, what you would never do for yourselves.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"Speak in your own praise.\"    \"And you have done it most nobly; I thank you.\"    \"And I brought the cardinal's hat a little nearer, just as it seemed to  be retreating from you.\"    \"Ah! I admit that,\" said Aramis, with a singular smile, \"you are,  indeed, not to be matched for making your friends' fortunes for them.\"    \"You see, then, that I only acted with the view of making Porthos's  fortune for him.\"    \"I meant to have done that myself; but your arm reaches farther than  ours.\"    It was now D'Artagnan's turn to smile.    \"Come,\" said Aramis, \"we ought to deal truthfully with each other. Do  you still love me, D'Artagnan?\"    \"The same as I used to do,\" replied D'Artagnan, without compromising  himself too much by this reply.    \"In that case, thanks; and now, for the most perfect frankness,\" said  Aramis; \"you visited Belle-Isle on behalf of the king?\"    \"_Pardieu!_\"    \"You wished to deprive us of the pleasure of offering Bell-Isle  completely fortified to the king.\"    \"But before I could deprive you of that pleasure, I ought to have been  made acquainted with your intention of doing so.\"    \"You came to Belle-Isle without knowing anything?\"    \"Of you! yes. How the devil could I imagine that Aramis had become  so clever an engineer as to be able to fortify like Polybius, or  Archimedes?\"    \"True. And yet you smelt me out over yonder?\"    \"Oh! yes.\"    \"And Porthos, too?\"    \"I did not divine that Aramis was an engineer. I was only able to guess  that Porthos might have become one. There is a saying, one becomes an  orator, one is born a poet; but it has never been said, one is born  Porthos, and one becomes an engineer.\"    \"Your wit is always amusing,\" said Aramis, coldly.    \"Well, I will go on.\"    \"Do. When you found out our secret, you made all the haste you could to  communicate it to the king.\"    \"I certainly made as much haste as I could, since I saw that you were  making still more. When a man weighing two hundred and fifty pounds, as  Porthos does, rides post; when a gouty prelate--I beg your pardon, but  you yourself told me you were so--when a prelate scours the highway--I  naturally suppose that my two friends, who did not wish to be  communicative with me, had certain matters of the highest importance  to conceal from me, and so I made as much haste as my leanness and the  absence of gout would allow.\"    \"Did it not occur to you, my dear friend, that you might be rendering  Porthos and myself a very sad service?\"    \"Yes, I thought it not unlikely; but you and Porthos made me play a very  ridiculous part at Belle-Isle.\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Aramis.    \"Excuse me,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"So that,\" pursued Aramis, \"you now know everything?\"    \"No,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27118"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 2, April 1906 (#14)"],[1,"cant, hypocrisy, or insincerity in it,      which makes it an almost unique publication.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Published Bimonthly.
