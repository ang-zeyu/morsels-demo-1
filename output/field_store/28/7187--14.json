If any think that this is incredible, let them bear in mind that  wax is an animal oil secreted from honey, and let them consider how many  pounds of corn or hay they must feed to their stock, in order to have  them gain a single pound of fat.    Many Apiarians are entirely ignorant of the great value of empty comb.  Suppose the honey to be worth only 15 cts. per lb., and the comb when  rendered into wax, to be worth 30 cts. per lb., the bee-master who melts  a pound of comb, loses nearly three dollars by the operation, and this,  without estimating the time which the bees have consumed in building the  comb. Unfortunately, in the ordinary hives, but little use can be made  of empty comb, unless it is new, and can be put into the surplus  honey-boxes: but by the use of my movable frames, every piece of good  worker-comb may be used to the best advantage, as it can be given to the  bees, to aid them in their labors.    It has been found very difficult to preserve comb from the bee-moth,  when it is taken from the bees. If it contains only a _few_ of the eggs  of this destroyer, these, in due time, will produce a progeny sufficient  to devour it. The comb, if it is attached to my frames, may be suspended  in a box or empty hive, and thoroughly smoked with sulphur; this will  kill any _worms_ which it may contain. When the weather is warm enough  to hatch the eggs of the moth, this process must be repeated a few  times, at intervals of about a week, so as to insure the destruction of  the worms as they hatch, for the sulphur does not seem always to destroy  the vitality of the eggs. The combs may now be kept in a tight box or  hive, with perfect safety.    Combs containing bee-bread, are of great value, and if given to young  colonies, which in spring are frequently destitute of this article, they  will materially assist them in early breeding.    Honey may be taken from my hives in the frames, and the covers of the  cells sliced off with a sharp knife; the honey can then be drained out,  and the empty combs returned to be filled again. A strong stock of bees,  in the height of the honey harvest, will fill empty combs with wonderful  rapidity. I lay it down, as one of my _first principles_ in bee culture,  that no good comb should ever be melted; it should all be carefully  preserved and given to the bees. If it is new, it may be easily attached  to the frames, or the honey-receptacles, by dipping the edge into melted  wax, pressing it gently until it stiffens, and then allowing it to cool.  If the comb is old, or the pieces large and full of bee-bread, it will  be best to dip them into melted rosin, which, besides costing much less  than wax, will secure a much firmer adhesion. When comb is put into  tumblers or other small vessels, the bees will begin to work upon it the  sooner, if it is simply crowded in, so as to be held in place by being  supported against the sides. It would seem as though they were disgusted  with such unworkmanlike proceedings, and that they cannot rest until  they have taken it into hand, and endeavored to \"make a job of it.\"    If the bee-keeper in using his choicest honey will be satisfied to  dispense with looks, and will carefully drain it from the beautiful  comb, he may use all such comb again to great advantage; not only saving  its intrinsic value, but greatly encouraging his bees to occupy and fill  all receptacles in which a portion of it is put. Bees seem to fancy _a  good start in life_, about as well as their more intelligent owners. To  this use all suitable drone comb should be put, as soon as it is removed  from the main hive. (See remarks on Drones.)    Ingenious efforts have been made, of late years, to construct  _artificial_ honey combs of porcelain, to be used for _feeding_ bees. No  one, to my knowledge, has ever attempted to imitate the delicate  mechanism of the bee so closely, as to construct artificial combs for  the ordinary uses of the hive; although for a long time I have  entertained the idea as very desirable, and yet as barely possible. I am  at present engaged in a course of experiments on this subject, the  results of which, in due time, I shall communicate to the public.    While writing this treatise, it has occurred to me that bees might be  induced to use old wax for the construction of their combs. Very fine  parings may be shaved off with glass, and if given to the bees, under  favorable circumstances, it seems to me very probable that they would  use them, just as they do the scales which are formed in their wax  pouches. Let strong colonies be deprived of some of their combs, after  the honey harvest is over, and supplied abundantly with these parings of  wax. Whether \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" or not, bees certainly do, when  it occurs among the combs of their main hive. They will not use the  honey stored up for winter use to replace the combs taken from them;  they can gather none from the flowers; and I have strong hopes that  necessity will with bees as well as men, prove the mother of invention,  and lead them to use the wax, as readily as they do the substitutes  offered them for pollen. (See Chapter on Pollen.)    If this conjecture should be verified by actual results, it would exert  a most powerful influence in the cheap and rapid multiplication of  colonies, and would enable the bees to store up most prodigious  quantities of honey. A pound of bees wax might then be made to store up  twenty pounds of honey, and the gain to the bee keeper would be the  difference in price between the pound of wax, and the twenty pounds of  honey, which the bees would have consumed in making the same amount of  comb. Strong stocks might thus during the dull season, when no honey can  be procured, be most profitably employed in building spare comb, to be  used in strengthening feeble stocks, and for a great variety of  purposes. Give me the means of cheaply obtaining large amounts of comb,  and I have almost found the philosopher's stone in bee keeping.    The building of comb is carried on with the greatest activity in the  night, while the honey is gathered by day. Thus no time is lost. If the  weather is too forbidding to allow the bees to go abroad, the combs are  very rapidly constructed, as the labor is carried on both by day and by  night. On the return of a fair day, the bees gather unusual quantities  of honey, as they have plenty of room for its storage. Thus it often  happens, that by their wise economy of time, they actually lose nothing,  even if confined, for several days, to their hive.        \"How doth the little busy bee, improve each _shining_ hour!\"    The poet might with equal truth have described her, as improving the  gloomy days, and the dark nights, in her useful labors.    It is an interesting fact, which I do not remember ever to have seen  particularly noticed by any writer, that honey gathering, and comb  building, go on simultaneously; so that when one stops, the other ceases  also. I have repeatedly observed, that as soon as the honey harvest  fails, the bees intermit their labors in building new comb, even when  large portions of their hive are unfilled. They might enlarge their  combs by using some of their stores; but then they would incur the risk  of perishing in the winter, by starvation. When honey no longer abounds  in the fields, it is wisely ordered, that they should not consume their  hoarded treasures, in expectation of further supplies, which may never  come. I do not believe, that any other safe rule could have been given  them; and if honey gathering was our business, with all our boasted  reason, we should be obliged to adopt the very same course.    Wax is one of the best non-conductors of heat, so that when it is warmed  by the animal heat of the bees, it can more easily be worked, than if it  parted with its heat too readily. By this property, the combs serve also  to keep the bees warm, and there is not so much risk of the honey  candying in the cells, or the combs cracking with frost. If wax was a  good conductor of heat, the combs would often be icy cold, moisture  would condense and freeze upon them, and they would fail to answer the  ends for which they are intended.    The size of the cells, in which workers are reared, never varies: the  same may substantially be said of the drone cells which are very  considerably larger; the cells in which honey is stored, often vary  exceedingly in depth, while in diameter, they are of all sizes from that  of the worker cells to that of the drones.    The cells of the bees are found perfectly to answer all the most refined  conditions of a very intricate mathematical problem! Let it be required  to find what shape a given quantity of matter must take, in order to  have _the greatest capacity, and the greatest strength_, requiring at  the same time, _the least space, and the least labor_ in its  construction. This problem has been solved by the most refined processes  of the higher mathematics, and the result is the hexagonal or six-sided  cell of the honey bee, with its three four-sided figures at the base!    The shape of these figures cannot be altered, _ever so little, except  for the worse_. Besides possessing the desirable qualities already  described, they answer as _nurseries_ for the rearing of the young, and  as _small air-tight vessels_ in which the honey is preserved from  souring or candying. Every prudent housewife who puts up her preserves  in tumblers, or small glass jars, and carefully pastes them over, to  keep out the air, will understand the value of such an arrangement.    \"There are only three possible figures of the cells,\" says Dr. Reid,  \"which can make them all equal and similar, without any useless spaces  between them. These are the equilateral triangle, the square and the  regular hexagon. It is well known to mathematicians that there is not a  fourth way possible, in which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],[0,"The Story of My Life (#14)"],[1,"planted, Apollos       watered, but God gave the increase.\" I Cor. iii. 6.         _Oct. 20th._--Once more, my Saviour, I renew my covenant and give       myself away; 'tis all that I can do.         _Oct. 27th._--For several days past the Lord has been very gracious       to my soul, and has greatly helped me in declaring His glorious       counsels. But to-day, my heart felt very hard while preaching to a       company of graceless sinners. It was in a tavern, and I doubt the       propriety of preaching in such places.         _Oct. 31st._--I am one month nearer my end; am I so much nearer God       and heaven? There are many precious hours I can give no favourable       account of. Had I been more faithful, I might have led some poor       wanderer into the way of truth. Oh, God, enter not into judgment       with me! Spare the barren fig-tree a little longer.         _November 4th--Friday (Fast Day.)_--One reason why my labours are       not more blessed, is because I feel and know so little of spiritual       things myself. There is too much of self about me.           \"When, gracious Lord, when shall it be,         That I shall find my all in Thee;         The fulness of Thy promise prove,         The seal of Thine eternal love.\"         _Nov. 6th._--I felt greatly blessed while addressing a large       Sabbath-school of more than a hundred scholars.    _Nov. 7th._--[On this day, the following letter was written from York by  Dr. Ryerson to his Father. He said: On leaving the old home lately, I  promised to write to you, my dear Father, and let you know how I am  getting on. I arrived here a few days after I left home. I have received  a letter from brother William, who told me that his prospects are  encouraging. I received a letter also from brother John. He reached  Perth about a fortnight after he left home, and was cordially received  by all classes. He preached the Sabbath after he got there to large and  respectable congregations. He was very much pleased with his  appointment, and his prospects are very favourable. On the first evening  of his preaching, one professed to experience justification by faith,  and several were deeply convicted. He thinks, from several  circumstances, that his appointment is of God. I am very well pleased  with my appointment. I travel with a person who is deeply pious, a true  and disinterested friend, and a very respectable preacher. I travel  about two hundred miles in four weeks, and preach twenty-five times,  besides funerals. I spend two Sabbaths in York, and two in the country.  Our prospects on the circuit are encouraging. In York we have most  flattering prospects. We have some increase almost every week. Our  morning congregations fill the chapel, which was never the case before;  and in the evening the chapel will not contain but little more than  three-quarters of the people. Last evening several members of Parliament  were present. I never addressed so large an audience before, and I never  was so assisted from heaven in preaching as at this place. I have spent  the last two Sabbaths in York, and I go to-day into the country. I was  requested yesterday to address the Union Sunday-school, which contains  about 150 or 200 children. It was a public examination of the School. I  never heard children recite so correctly, and so perfectly before, as  they did. There was quite a large congregation present, as it was  designed to make a contribution for the support of the School. I first  addressed a short discourse to the children, and then addressed the  assembly. It was the most precious season that I ever experienced. It  is, my dear Father, the most delightful employment I ever engaged in, to  proclaim the name of Jesus to lost sinners. I feel more firmly attached  to the cause than ever. The Lord has comforted, blessed, and prospered  me beyond my expectations. I am resolved to devote all that I have and  am, to his service. Get George to write shortly all the news of the day.  Remember me to my dear Mother.--H.]    [After writing to his Father, he wrote on the same day to his brother  George, as follows:--    I have just heard the Governor's Speech to the two Houses of the  Legislature. In the latter part of his address he hinted at a certain  communication, which, by the permission of His Majesty, he would make by  Message, to remove apprehensions that affected the civil rights of a  very considerable part of the community. As to my religious enjoyments,  I think that Christ has been more precious to me than ever. When I came  into this Circuit, I began to fast and pray more than ever I had done  before, and the Lord has greatly blessed me. I have scarcely had a  barren time in preaching. I feel more strongly attached to the cause  than ever. While the Lord will help, I am resolved to go forward. Rev.  James Richardson is a man of good sense, and deep piety, and a very  acceptable and useful preacher.--H.]         _Nov. 10th._--Travelled twenty-two miles and preached twice. My       views of Scripture of late have been obscure; I can recall the       truths to my mind, but they don't make that impression they have       hitherto done. Is this change of feeling inherent, or the effect of       neglect of duty, and want of watchfulness? I will examine this       point more fully. I know it is my privilege to enjoy peace with       God, but whether it be my privilege at all times to possess equal       feeling, I am not certain.         _Nov. 23rd._--I think Mr. Wesley's advice indispensably necessary,       \"to rise as soon as we wake.\" I am resolved to be more punctual in       rising for the time to come.         _Nov. 29th._--How painful does my experience prove the truth of the       Apostle, that \"when I would do good evil is present with me.\" I       have thought sometimes it would be impossible to forget God, or to       be lukewarm in His cause; but alas I am prone to evil continually.         _December 14th._--The Lord has greatly delivered my soul from the       burden of guilt and fear with which I have been so painfully bowed       down for several days past; and, blessed be the name of the Lord,       He begins to revive His work on the circuit. Five more have been       added to the Church this week. Glory to God for His mercy and love!         _Dec. 30th._--A part of the day I spent in the Legislature. The       first three months of last year I was in bad health, confined to my       bed part of the time. The last nine months I have spent in trying       to seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel.         _York, January 1st, 1826._--How faithful is the Saviour to that       promise, \"Lo, I am with thee, even to the end of the world.\" Though       weak in body I have had to preach three times a day, and travel       many miles. Jesus has been very precious to my soul.         _February 3rd._--I have travelled to-day in an Irish settlement,       and preached twice to them. My life is a scene of toil and pain, I       am far from well, and far from parents and relatives. While others       enjoy all the advantages of domestic life, I am doomed to deny       myself. Oh, my soul, behold the example the Saviour has set. \"He       had not where to lay his head.\" Is the servant above his Lord?         _Feb. 11th._--For several days I have been visiting my friends. I       think they are improving in religious knowledge. What an       unspeakable blessing to see them showing a desire to walk in the       narrow way that leads to life eternal.         _Feb. 18th._--I have just returned to my Circuit. This is the first       time I ever dropped appointments for the gratification of seeing my       friends. It has taught me the lesson, that labouring in the       vineyard of the Lord is more blessed than any personal       gratification.         _Feb. 28th._--This month presents the most mournful portrait I have       ever beheld in retrospect of my past time since I began to travel.       Since I visited my friends everything has gone against me. The       season of recreation was not improved as it ought to have been; I       lost the unction of the Holy One, and returned to my Circuit       depressed in mind. Shall I sink down in despair? No, I will return       unto the Lord. He has smitten, He will heal. I will go to the       fountain open for sin and uncleanness. I will renew my covenant,       and offer my poor all to him once more.         _March 23rd._--This day closes my twenty-third year and the first       of my ministry. How mysterious was the providence which induced me       to enter the itinerant ministry. It was the Lord's doing, and it is       marvellous in my eyes. Since I have devoted myself to Him in a       perpetual covenant, how great has been His paternal care over me. I       have felt the rod of affliction, but, He has sanctified it. I have       been assailed by temptation, but He has delivered me. I have been       caressed and flattered, but the Lord, in great mercy, has saved me       from the dangerous rocks of vanity and pride. My soul has at times       been overspread with clouds and darkness, but the \"Sun of       Righteousness has again risen\" with brightness on his wings. I have       oft been cast down, but blessed be the Lord who has given me the       \"oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit       of heaviness.\" My mind at times has been filled with doubts and       fears, and I have been tempted to say, \"I have cleansed my heart in       vain, and washed my hands in innocency,\" but the Lord has saved my       feet from slipping, and established my goings upon a firm       foundation. He has put a new song into my mouth, and enabled me to       say, \"What time I am afraid I will trust in Thee.\"         _April 17th._--This day, for the first time, I have declared to the       aborigines of the country that \"Jesus is precious to those who       believe.\" My heart rejoiced in God,"]]]
