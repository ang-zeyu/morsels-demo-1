There were days, though,  clear and soft and warm, when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf  over the hand-lines and spank the drifting \"sun-scalds\" with an oar;  and there were days of light airs, when Harvey was taught how to steer  the schooner from one berth to another.    It thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his hand  on the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed  back and forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of  Disko saying that it would break a snake's back to follow his wake.  But, as usual, pride ran before a fall. They were sailing on the wind  with the staysail--an old one, luckily--set, and Harvey jammed her  right into it to show Dan how completely he had mastered the art. The  foresail went over with a bang, and the foregaff stabbed and ripped  through the stay-sail, which, was of course, prevented from going over  by the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful silence, and Harvey  spent his leisure hours for the next few days under Tom Platt's lee,  learning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he  said, he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days.    Boylike, Harvey imitated all the men by turns, till he had combined  Disko's peculiar stoop at the wheel, Long Jack's swinging overhand when  the lines were hauled, Manuel's round-shouldered but effective stroke  in a dory, and Tom Platt's generous Ohio stride along the deck.    \"'Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut,\" said Long Jack, when Harvey  was looking out by the windlass one thick noon. \"I'll lay my wage an'  share 'tis more'n half play-actin' to him, an' he consates himself he's  a bowld mariner. 'Watch his little bit av a back now!\"    \"That's the way we all begin,\" said Tom Platt. \"The boys they make  believe all the time till they've cheated 'emselves into bein' men, an'  so till they die--pretendin' an' pretendin'. I done it on the old Ohio,  I know. Stood my first watch--harbor-watch--feelin' finer'n Farragut.  Dan's full o' the same kind o' notions. See 'em now, actin' to be  genewine moss-backs--every hair a rope-yarn an' blood Stockholm tar.\"  He spoke down the cabin stairs. \"'Guess you're mistook in your  judgments fer once, Disko. What in Rome made ye tell us all here the  kid was crazy?\"    \"He wuz,\" Disko replied. \"Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard; but I'll  say he's sobered up consid'ble sence. I cured him.\"    \"He yarns good,\" said Tom Platt. \"T'other night he told us abaout a kid  of his own size steerin' a cunnin' little rig an' four ponies up an'  down Toledo, Ohio, I think 'twas, an' givin' suppers to a crowd o'  sim'lar kids. Cur'us kind o' fairy-tale, but blame interestin'. He  knows scores of 'em.\"    \"'Guess he strikes 'em outen his own head,\" Disko called from the  cabin, where he was busy with the log-book. \"'Stands to reason that  sort is all made up. It don't take in no one but Dan, an' he laughs at  it. I've heard him, behind my back.\"    \"Y'ever hear what Sim'on Peter Ca'houn said when they whacked up a  match 'twix' his sister Hitty an' Lorin' Jerauld, an' the boys put up  that joke on him daown to Georges?\" drawled Uncle Salters, who was  dripping peaceably under the lee of the starboard dory-nest.    Tom Platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence: he was a Cape Cod  man, and had not known that tale more than twenty years. Uncle Salters  went on with a rasping chuckle:    \"Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he said, an' he was jest right, abaout Lorin',  'Ha'af on the taown,' he said, 'an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' they  told me she's married a 'ich man.' Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he hedn't no  roof to his mouth, an' talked that way.\"    \"He didn't talk any Pennsylvania Dutch,\" Tom Platt replied. \"You'd  better leave a Cape man to tell that tale. The Ca'houns was gipsies  frum 'way back.\"    \"Wal, I don't profess to be any elocutionist,\" Salters said. \"I'm  comin' to the moral o' things. That's jest abaout what aour Harve be!  Ha'af on the taown, an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' there's some'll  believe he's a rich man. Yah!\"    \"Did ye ever think how sweet 'twould be to sail wid a full crew o'  Salterses?\" said Long Jack. \"Ha'af in the furrer an' other ha'af in the  muck-heap, as Ca'houn did not say, an' makes out he's a fisherman!\"    A little laugh went round at Salters's expense.    Disko held his tongue, and wrought over the log-book that he kept in a  hatchet-faced, square hand; this was the kind of thing that ran on,  page after soiled page:    \"July 17. This day thick fog and few fish. Made berth to northward. So  ends this day.    \"July 18. This day comes in with thick fog. Caught a few fish.    \"July 19. This day comes in with light breeze from N. E. and fine  weather. Made a berth to eastward. Caught plenty fish.    \"July 20. This, the Sabbath, comes in with fog and light winds. So ends  this day. Total fish caught this week, 3,478.\"    They never worked on Sundays, but shaved, and washed themselves if it  were fine, and Pennsylvania sang hymns. Once or twice he suggested  that, if it was not an impertinence, he thought he could preach a  little. Uncle Salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion,  reminding him that he was not a preacher and mustn't think of such  things. We'd hev him rememberin' Johnstown next,\" Salters explained,  \"an' what would happen then?\" So they compromised on his reading aloud  from a book called \"Josephus.\" It was an old leather-bound volume,  smelling of a hundred voyages, very solid and very like the Bible, but  enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges; and they read it nearly  from cover to cover. Otherwise Penn was a silent little body. He would  not utter a word for three days on end sometimes, though he played  checkers, listened to the songs, and laughed at the stories. When they  tried to stir him up, he would answer. \"I don't wish to seem  unneighbourly, but it is because I have nothing to say. My head feels  quite empty. I've almost forgotten my name.\" He would turn to Uncle  Salters with an expectant smile.    \"Why, Pennsylvania Pratt,\" Salters would shout. \"You'll fergit me next!\"    \"No--never,\" Penn would say, shutting his lips firmly. \"Pennsylvania  Pratt, of course,\" he would repeat over and over. Sometimes it was  Uncle Salters who forgot, and told him he was Haskins or Rich or  McVitty; but Penn was equally content--till next time.    He was always very tender with Harvey, whom he pitied both as a lost  child and as a lunatic; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy,  he relaxed, too. Salters was not an amiable person (he esteemed it his  business to keep the boys in order); and the first time Harvey, in fear  and trembling, on a still day, managed to shin up to the main-truck  (Dan was behind him ready to help), he esteemed it his duty to hang  Salters's big sea-boots up there--a sight of shame and derision to the  nearest schooner. With Disko, Harvey took no liberties; not even when  the old man dropped direct orders, and treated him, like the rest of  the crew, to \"Don't you want to do so and so?\" and \"Guess you'd  better,\" and so forth. There was something about the clean-shaven lips  and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to  young blood.    Disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart, which,  he said, laid over any government publication whatsoever; led him,  pencil in hand, from berth to berth over the whole string of banks--Le  Have, Western, Banquereau, St. Pierre, Green, and Grand--talking \"cod\"  meantime. Taught him, too, the principle on which the \"hog-yoke\" was  worked.    In this Harvey excelled Dan, for he had inherited a head for figures,  and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen  Bank sun appealed to all his keen wits. For other sea-matters his age  handicapped him. As Disko said, he should have begun when he was ten.  Dan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark; and at  a pinch, when Uncle Salters had a gurry-sore on his palm, could dress  down by sense of touch. He could steer in anything short of half a gale  from the feel of the wind on his face, humouring the \"We're Here\" just  when she needed it. These things he did as automatically as he skipped  about the rigging, or made his dory a part of his own will and body.  But he could not communicate his knowledge to Harvey.    Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the  schooner on stormy days, when they lay up in the fo'c'sle or sat on the  cabin lockers, while spare eye-bolts, leads, and rings rolled and  rattled in the pauses of the talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in  the Fifties; of great she-whales slain beside their young; of death  agonies on the black, tossing seas, and blood that spurted forty feet  in the air; of boats smashed to splinters; of patent rockets that went  off wrong-end-first and bombarded the trembling crews; of cutting-in  and boiling-down, and that terrible \"nip\" of '71, when twelve hundred  men were made homeless on the ice in three days--wonderful tales, all  true. But more wonderful still were his stories of the cod, and how  they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below  the keel.    Long Jack's tastes ran more to the supernatural. He held them silent  with ghastly stories of the \"Yo-hoes\" on Monomoy Beach, that mock and  terrify lonely clam-diggers; of sand-walkers and dune-haunters who were  never properly buried; of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the  spirits of Kidd's men; of ships that sailed in the fog straight over  Truro township; of that harbour in Maine where no one but a stranger  will lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who  row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their  old-fashioned boat, whistling--not calling, but whistling--for the soul  of the man who broke their rest.    Harvey had a notion that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#14)"],[1,"public it was a very good story of a battle.  Those men who, after great hardships, were enabled to see the actual  battle found that the poor messages which the Censor permitted them to  send took ten days or more in transmission to London. Why have taken all  the trouble and expense of going to the front? Buda-Pesth, on the way  there, is a lovely city; Bucharest also; and charming Vienna was not at  all too far away if you had a good staff-map and a lively military  imagination.    In yet another paper there was a vivid picture--scenery, date, Greenwich  time, and all to give an air of artistic verisimilitude--of the signing  of the Peace armistice. The armistice had not been signed at the time,  was not signed for some days after. But it would have been absurd to  have waited, since \"our special correspondent\" had seen it all in  advance, right down to the embrace of the Turkish delegate and the  Bulgarian delegate, and knew that some of the conditions were that the  Turkish commissariat was to feed the Bulgarian troops at Chatalja and  the Bulgarian commissariat the Turkish troops in Adrianople. If his  paper had waited for the truth that most charming story would never have  seen the light.    So, in a little book I shall one day bring out in the \"Attractive  Occupations\" series on \"How to be a War Correspondent,\" I shall give  this general advice:    1. Before operations begin, visit the army to which you are accredited,  and take notes of the general appearance of officers and men. Also learn  a few military phrases of their language. Ascertain all possible  particulars of a personal character concerning the generals and chief  officers.    2. Return then to a base outside the country. It must have good  telegraph communication with your newspaper. For the rest you may decide  its locality by the quality of the wine, or the beer, or the cooking.    3. Secure a set of good maps of the scene of operations. It will be  handy also to have any books which have been published describing  campaigns over the same _terrain_.    4. Keep in touch with the official bulletins issued by the military  authorities from the scene of operations. But be on guard not to become  enslaved by them. If, for instance, you wait for official notices of  battles, you will be much hampered in your picturesque work. Fight  battles when they ought to be fought and how they ought to be fought.  The story's the thing.    5. A little sprinkling of personal experience is wise; for example, a  bivouac on the battlefield, toasting your bacon at a fire made of a  broken-down gun-carriage with a bayonet taken from a dead soldier.  Mention the nationality of the bacon. You cannot be too precise in  details.    [Illustration: A YOUNG WIDOW AT HER HUSBAND'S GRAVE]    Ko-Ko's account of the execution of Nankipoo is, in short, the model for  the future war correspondent. The other sort of war correspondent, who  patiently studied and recorded operations, seems to be doomed. In the  nature of things it must be so. The more competent and the more accurate  he is, the greater the danger he is to the army which he accompanies.  His despatches, published in his newspaper and telegraphed promptly to  the other side, give to them at a cheap cost that information of what is  going on _behind_ their enemy's screen of scouts which is so vital to  tactical, and sometimes to strategical, dispositions. To try to obtain  that information an army pours out much blood and treasure; to guard  that information an army will consume a full third of its energies in an  elaborate system of mystification. A modern army must either banish  the war correspondent altogether or subject him to such restrictions of  Censorship as to veto honest, accurate, and prompt criticism or record  of operations.    The Bulgarian army had not the courage to refuse authorisation to the  swarm of journalists which descended upon its headquarters. Editors had  argued it out that the small Balkan States, anxious to have a \"good  press\" in Europe, would give correspondents a good show. But the  Bulgarian authorities, anxious as they were to conciliate foreign public  opinion, dared not allow a free run to the newspaper representatives.  Apart from the considerations I have mentioned, which must govern any  modern war, there were special reasons why the Bulgarians should be  nervous of observation. They were waging war on \"forlorn hope\" lines  with the slenderest resources, with the knowledge that officers and  men--especially transport officers--had to do almost the impossible to  win through. Further, they had the knowledge that in some cases the  correspondents were representing the newspapers (and the Governments,  for newspapers and cabinets often work hand in hand on the Continent) of  nations which were at the very moment threatening mobilisation against  the Balkan States. To have specially excepted Roumanian, Austrian, and  German press representatives from permission to see operations would  have been impossible. The method was adopted of authorising as many  press correspondents as cared to apply, then carefully pocketing them  where they could see nothing, and instituting such a rigorous Censorship  as to guard effectively against any important facts, gleaned indirectly,  leaking out. A few managed to earn enough of the Bulgarian confidence to  be allowed to go through to the front and see things. But, even then,  the Censorship and the monopoly of the telegraph line for military  messages prevented them from despatching anything.    Some of the correspondents--one in particular--overcame a secretive  military system and a harsh Censorship by the use of a skilled  imagination and of a friendly telegraph line outside the area of  Censorship. At the staff headquarters at Stara Zagora during the early  days of the campaign, when we were all straining at the leash to get to  the front, waiting and fussing, he was working, reconstructing the  operations with maps and a fine imagination, and never allowing his  paper to want for news. I think that he was quite prepared to have  taken pupils for his new school of war correspondents. Often he would  come to me for a yarn--in halting French on both sides--and would  explain the campaign as it was being carried on. One eloquent gesture he  habitually had--a sweeping motion which brought his arms together as  though they were gathering up a bundle of spears, then the hands would  meet in an expressive squeeze. \"It is that,\" he said, \"it is  Napoleonic.\"    Probably the Censor at this stage did not interfere much with his  activities, content enough to allow fanciful descriptions of Napoleonic  strategy to go to the outer world. But, in my experience, facts, if one  ascertained something independently, were not treated kindly.    \"Why not?\" I asked the Censor vexedly about one message he had stopped.  \"It is true.\"    \"Yes, that is the trouble,\" he said--the nearest approach to a joke I  ever got out of a Bulgarian, for they are a sober, God-fearing, and  humour-fearing race.    The idea of the Bulgarian Censorship in regard to the privileges and  duties of the war correspondent was further illustrated to me on another  occasion, when a harmless map of a past phase of the campaign was  stopped.    \"Then what am I to send?\" I asked.    \"There are the bulletins,\" he said.    \"Yes, the bulletins which are just your bald official account of  week-old happenings which are sent to every news-agency in Europe before  we see them!\"    \"But you are a war correspondent. You can add to them in your own  language.\"    Remembering that conversation, I suspect that at first the Bulgarian  Censorship did not object to fairy tales passing over the wires, though  the way was blocked for exact observation. An enterprising story-maker  had not very serious difficulties at the outset. Afterwards there was a  change, and even the writer of fairy stories had to work outside the  range of the Censor.    We were all allowed down to Mustapha Pasha, and considered that that was  a big step to the front. \"For two days or so,\" we were told, it would be  our duty to wait patiently within the town (the battle-ground around  Adrianople was about twelve miles distant). Some waited there two months  and saw no real operations. The Censorship at Mustapha Pasha was so  strict that all private letters had to be submitted, and if they were  in English the English Censor insisted that they should be read to him  aloud; and he re-read them, again aloud, to see if he had fully grasped  their significance. Then they could go if they contained no military  information and did not mention guns, oxen, soldiers, roads, mud, dirt,  or other tabooed subjects. An amusing \"rag\" was tried on the Censor  there. A sorely tried correspondent wrote a letter of extreme warmth to  an imaginary sweetheart. This began \"Ducksie Darling,\" and continued in  the same strain for two pages. He waited until there was a full  house--the Censors had no private office, but did their censoring in a  large room which was open to all the correspondents--and then submitted  his ardent outburst. Other press-men did not see the joke at first, and  began to sidle out of the room as, like a stream of warm treacle, the  love-letter flowed on. But they came back.    \"'Ducksie Darling,'\" began the writer, \"that, you know, is not a  military term. It is a phrase of endearment used in England.--'A  thousand, thousand kisses'--that has nothing to do with the disposition  of troops.\" So he went through to the honeyed end, the Censor blushing  and furious, the audience hilarious.    The Mustapha Pasha Censorship would not allow ox-wagons or reservists to  be mentioned, nor officers' names. The Censorship objected, too, for a  long time to any mention of the all-pervading mud which was the chief  item of interest in the town's life. Yet you might have lost an army  division in some of the puddles. (But stop, I am"]]]
