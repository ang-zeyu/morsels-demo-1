Each way I  turned, I saw the grey figure before my eyes at precisely the same  distance! Then I knew I had seen the Bodach Glas. My hair stood up, and  so strong an impression of awe came upon me that I resolved to return to  my quarters. As I went, the spirit glided steadily before me, till we  came to the narrow bridge, where it turned and stood waiting for me. I  could not wade the stream. I could not bring myself to turn back. So,  making the sign of the cross, I drew my sword and cried aloud, 'In the  name of God, Evil Spirit, give place!'    \"'_Vich Ian Vohr_,' it said in a dreadful voice, '_beware of  to-morrow!_'    \"It was then within half a yard of my sword's point, but as the words  were uttered it was gone. There was nothing either on the bridge or on  the way home. All is over. I am doomed. I have seen the Bodach Glas,  the curse of my house.\"    [Illustration: \"THE spirit glided steadily before me, till we came to  the narrow bridge, where it turned and stood waiting for me.

His friend's belief in  the reality of the vision was too strong. He could only ask to be  allowed to march once more with the sons of Ivor, who occupied the post  of danger in the rear. Edward easily obtained the Baron's leave to do  so, and when the Clan Mac-Ivor entered the village, he joined them, once  more arm in arm with their Chieftain. At the sight, all the Mac-Ivors'  ill feeling was blown away in a moment. Evan Dhu received him with a  grin of pleasure. And the imp Callum, with a great patch on his head,  appeared particularly delighted to see him.    But Waverley's stay with the Clan Ivor was not to be long. The enemy was  continually harassing their flanks, and the rear-guard had to keep  lining hedges and dikes in order to beat them off. Night was already  falling on the day which Fergus had foretold would be his last, when in  a chance skirmish of outposts the Chief with a few followers found  himself surrounded by a strong attacking force of dragoons. A swift eddy  of the battle threw Edward out to one side. The cloud of night lifted,  and he saw Evan Dhu and a few others, with the Chieftain in their midst,  desperately defending themselves against a large number of dragoons who  were hewing at them with their swords. It was quite impossible for  Waverley to break through to their assistance. Night shut down  immediately, and he found it was equally impossible for him to rejoin  the retreating Highlanders, whose warpipes he could still hear in the  distance.      INTERLUDE OF BREVITY        The _Bodach Glas_ held the children. The brilliant      sunshine of the High Garden in which they had      listened to the tale became instantly palest      moonlight, and between them and the strawberry bed      they saw the filmy plaid of the Grey Spectre of the      House of Ivor. It had been helpful and even      laudable to play-act the chief scenes when the      story was beginning, but now they had no time. It      would have been an insult to the interest of the      narrative.        Doubtless, if they had had the book, they would      have _skipped_, to know \"how it all ended.\" But it      was time for the evening walk. So, instead of      stringing themselves out along the way as was their      custom, seeing if the raspberry bushes had grown      any taller since the morning, the four collected in      a close swarm about the tale-teller, like bees      about an emigrant queen.        \"You must tell us the rest--you _must!_\" they said,      linking arms about my waist to prevent any attempt      at an evasion of such just demands.        So, being secretly no little pleased with their      eagerness, I launched out upon the conclusion of      the whole matter--which showed, among other things,      how Waverley-Honour was more honoured than ever and      the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine threefold blessed.          THE LAST TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"      THE BARON'S SURPRISE    AFTER wandering about for some time Edward came unexpectedly upon a  hamlet. Lights gleamed down the street, and Edward could hear loud  voices and the tramp of horses. The sound of shouted orders and  soldiers' oaths soon told him that he was in great danger. For these  were English troops, and if they caught him in his Mac-Ivor tartan,  would assuredly give him short shrift and a swift bullet.    Lingering a moment uncertainly near the gate of a small garden  enclosure, he felt himself caught by gentle hands and drawn toward a  house.    \"Come, Ned,\" said a low voice, \"the dragoons are down the village, and  they will do thee a mischief. Come with me into feyther's!\"    Judging this to be very much to the purpose, Edward followed, but when  the girl saw the tall figure in tartans instead of the sweetheart she  had expected, she dropped the candle she had lighted, and called out for  her father.    A stout Westmoreland peasant at once appeared, poker in hand, and  presently Edward found himself not ill received--by the daughter on  account of a likeness to her lover (so she said) and by the father  because of a certain weakness for the losing side. So, in the house of  Farmer Jopson, Edward slept soundly that night, in spite of the dangers  which surrounded him on every side. In the morning the true Edward,  whose name turned out to be Ned Williams, was called in to consult with  father and daughter. It seemed impossible for Edward to go north to  rejoin the Prince's forces. They had evacuated Penrith and marched away  toward Carlisle. The whole intervening country was covered by scouting  parties of government horsemen. Whereupon Ned Williams, who wished above  all things to rid the house of his handsome namesake, lest his  sweetheart Cicely should make other mistakes, offered to get Waverley a  change of clothes, and to conduct him to his father's farm near  Ulswater. Neither old Jopson nor his daughter would accept a farthing of  money for saving Waverley's life. A hearty handshake paid one; a kiss,  the other. And so it was not long before Ned Williams was introducing  our hero to his family, in the character of a young clergyman who was  detained in the north by the unsettled state of the country.    On their way into Cumberland they passed the field of battle where  Edward had lost sight of Fergus. Many bodies still lay upon the face of  the moorland, but that of Vich Ian Vohr was not among them, and Edward  passed on with some hope that in spite of the _Bodach Glas_, Fergus  might have escaped his doom. They found Callum Beg, however, his tough  skull cloven at last by a dragoon's sword, but there was no sign either  of Evan or of his Chieftain.    In the secure shelter of good Farmer Williams's house among the hills,  it was Edward's lot to remain somewhat longer than he intended. In the  first place, it was wholly impossible to move for ten days, owing to a  great fall of snow. Then he heard how that the Prince had retreated  farther into Scotland, how Carlisle had been besieged and taken by the  English, and that the whole north was covered by the hosts of the Duke  of Cumberland and General Wade.    But in the month of January it happened that the clergyman who came to  perform the ceremony at the wedding of Ned Williams and Cicely Jopson,  brought with him a newspaper which he showed to Edward. In it Waverley  read with astonishment a notice of his father's death in London, and of  the approaching trial of Sir Everard for high treason--unless (said the  report) Edward Waverley, son of the late Richard Waverley, and heir to  the baronet, should in the meantime surrender himself to justice.    It was with an aching anxious heart that Waverley set out by the  northern diligence for London. He found himself in the vehicle opposite  to an officer's wife, one Mrs. Nosebag, who tormented him all the way  with questions, on several occasions almost finding him out, and once at  least narrowly escaping giving him an introduction to a recruiting  sergeant of his own regiment.    However, in spite of all risks, he arrived safely under Colonel Talbot's  roof, where he found that, though the news of his father's death was  indeed true, yet his own conduct certainly had nothing to do with the  matter--nor was Sir Everard in the slightest present danger.    Whereupon, much relieved as to his family, Edward proclaimed his  intention of returning to Scotland as soon as possible--not indeed to  join with the rebels again, but for the purpose of seeking out Rose  Bradwardine and conducting her to a place of safety.    It was not, perhaps, the wisest course he might have pursued. But during  his lonely stay at Farmer Williams's farm, Edward's heart had turned  often and much to Rose. He could not bear to think of her alone and  without protection. By means of a passport (which had been obtained for  one Frank Stanley, Colonel Talbot's nephew), Waverley was able easily to  reach Edinburgh. Here from the landlady, with whom he and Fergus had  lodged, Edward first heard the dread news of Culloden, of the slaughter  of the clans, the flight of the Prince, and, worst of all, how Fergus  and Evan Dhu, captured the night of the skirmish, were presently on  trial for their lives at Carlisle. Flora also was in Carlisle, awaiting  the issue of the trial, while with less certainty Rose Bradwardine was  reported to have gone back to her father's mansion of Tully-Veolan.  Concerning the brave old Baron himself, Edward could get no news, save  that he had fought most stoutly at Culloden, but that the government  were particularly bitter against him because he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#14)"],[1," worked on \"his own hook\"--and it was literally his own hook; for a tally  was kept of the fish caught by each man, and the proceeds of the trip  were divided in proportion to the number of fish each caught. When there  was a big run of fish, the men never stopped to eat or sleep, but when  food was held to them gnawed it off while their hands were employed with  the fish-lines. With every fishing-vessel that left Gloucester and  Marblehead, the chief centres of the fishing industries, went a boy of  ten or twelve to learn to be a skilled fisherman. He was called a  \"cut-tail,\" for he cut a wedge-shaped bit from the tail of every fish he  caught, and when the fish were sorted out the cut-tails showed the boy's  share of the profit.    For centuries, fish was plentiful and cheap in New England. The  traveller Bennet wrote of Boston, in 1740:--         \"Fish is exceedingly cheap. They sell a fine cod, will weigh a       dozen pounds or more, just taken out of the sea for about twopence       sterling. They have smelts, too, which they sell as cheap as sprats       in London. Salmon, too, they have in great plenty, and these they       sell for about a shilling apiece which will weigh fourteen or       fifteen pounds.\"    Two kinds of delicious fish, beloved, perhaps, above all others  to-day,--salmon and shad,--seem to have been lightly regarded in  colonial days. The price of salmon--less than a penny a pound--shows the  low estimation in which it was held in the early years of the eighteenth  century. It is told that farm-laborers in the vicinity of the  Connecticut River when engaged to work stipulated that they should have  salmon for dinner but once a week.    Shad were profoundly despised; it was even held to be somewhat  disreputable to eat them; and the story is told of a family in Hadley,  Massachusetts, who were about to dine on shad, that, hearing a knock at  the door, they would not open it till the platter holding the obnoxious  shad had been hidden. At first they were fed chiefly to hogs. Two shad  for a penny was the ignoble price in 1733, and it was never much higher  until after the Revolution. After shad and salmon acquired a better  reputation as food, the falls of various rivers became great resorts for  American fishermen as they had been for the Indians. Both kinds of fish  were caught in scoop-nets and seines below the falls. Men came from a  distance and loaded horses and carts with the fish to carry home. Every  farmhouse near was filled with visitors. It was estimated that at the  falls at South Hadley there were fifteen hundred horses in one day.    Salted fish was as carefully prepared and amiably regarded for home use  in New England and New York as in England and Holland at the same date.  The ling and herring of the old countries of Europe gave place in  America to cod, shad, and mackerel. The greatest pains was taken in  preparing, drying, and salting the plentiful fish. It is said that in  New York towns, such as New York and Brooklyn, after shad became a  popular fish, great heaps were left when purchased at each door, and  that the necessary cleaning and preparation of the shad was done on the  street. As all housewives purchased shad and salted and packed at about  the same time, those public scavengers, the domestic hogs who roamed  the town streets unchecked (and ever welcomed), must have been specially  useful at shad-time.    Not in the waters, but of it, were the magnificent tribes of marine fowl  that, undiminished by the feeble weapons and few numbers of the Indians,  had peopled for centuries the waters of the New World. The Chesapeake  and its tributaries furnished each autumn vast feeding-grounds of wild  celery and other aquatic plants to millions of those creatures. The  firearms of Captain John Smith and his two companions were poor things  compared with the fowling-pieces of to-day, but with their three shots  they killed a hundred and forty-eight ducks at one firing. The splendid  wild swan wheeled and trumpeted in the clear autumn air; the wild geese  flew there in their beautiful V-shaped flight; duck in all the varieties  known to modern sportsmen--canvas-back, mallard, widgeon, redhead,  oxeye, dottrel--rested on the Chesapeake waters in vast flocks a mile  wide and seven miles long. Governor Berkeley named also brant, shell  drake, teal, and blewings. The sound of their wings was said to be \"like  a great storm coming over the water.\" For centuries these ducks have  been killed by the white man, and still they return each autumn to their  old feeding-places.          CHAPTER VI    INDIAN CORN      A great field of tall Indian corn waving its stately and luxuriant green  blades, its graceful spindles, and glossy silk under the hot August sun,  should be not only a beautiful sight to every American, but a suggestive  one; one to set us thinking of all that Indian corn means to us in our  history. It was a native of American soil at the settlement of this  country, and under full and thoroughly intelligent cultivation by the  Indians, who were also native sons of the New World. Its abundance,  adaptability, and nourishing qualities not only saved the colonists'  lives, but altered many of their methods of living, especially their  manner of cooking and their tastes in food.    One of the first things that every settler in a new land has to learn is  that he must find food in that land; that he cannot trust long to any  supplies of food which he has brought with him, or to any fresh supplies  which he has ordered to be sent after him. He must turn at once to  hunting, fishing, planting, to furnish him with food grown and found in  the very place where he is.    This was quickly learned by the colonists in America, except in  Virginia, where they had sad starving-times before all were convinced  that corn was a better crop for settlers than silk or any of the many  hoped-for productions which might be valuable in one sense but which  could not be eaten. Powhatan, the father of the Indian princess  Pocahontas, was one of the first to \"send some of his People that they  may teach the English how to sow the Grain of his Country.\" Captain John  Smith, ever quick to learn of every one and ever practical, got two  Indians, in the year 1608, to show him how to break up and plant forty  acres of corn, which yielded him a good crop. A succeeding governor of  Virginia, Sir Thomas Dale, equally practical, intelligent, and  determined, assigned small farms to each colonist, and encouraged and  enforced the growing of corn. Soon many thousand bushels were raised.  There was a terrible Indian massacre in 1622, for the careless  colonists, in order to be free to give their time to the raising of that  new and exceedingly alluring and high-priced crop, tobacco, had given  the Indians firearms to go hunting game for them; and the lesson of easy  killing with powder and shot, when once learned, was turned with havoc  upon the white men. The following year comparatively little corn was  planted, as the luxuriant foliage made a perfect ambush for the close  approach of the savages to the settlements. There was, of course,  scarcity and famine as the result; and a bushel of corn-meal became  worth twenty to thirty shillings, which sum had a value equal to twenty  to thirty dollars to-day. The planters were each compelled by the  magistrates the following year to raise an ample amount of corn to  supply all the families; and to save a certain amount for seed as well.  There has been no lack of corn since that time in Virginia.    The French colonists in Louisiana, perhaps because they were accustomed  to more dainty food than the English, fiercely hated corn, as have the  Irish in our own day. A band of French women settlers fairly raised a  \"petticoat rebellion\" in revolt against its daily use. A despatch of the  governor of Louisiana says of these rebels:--         \"The men in the colony begin through habit to use corn as an       article of food; but the women, who are mostly Parisians, have for       this food a dogged aversion, which has not been subdued. They       inveigh bitterly against His Grace, the Bishop of Quebec, who, they       say, has enticed them away from home under pretext of sending them       to enjoy the milk and honey of the land of promise.\"    This hatred of corn was shared by other races. An old writer says:--         \"Peter Martyr could magnifie the Spaniards, of whom he reports they       led a miserable life for three days together, with parched grain of       maize onlie\"--    which, when compared with the diet of New England settlers for weeks at  a time, seems such a bagatelle as to be scarce worth the mention of  Peter Martyr. By tradition, still commemorated at Forefathers' Dinners,  the ration of Indian corn supplied to each person in the colony in time  of famine was but five kernels.    The stores brought over by the Pilgrims were poor and inadequate enough;  the beef and pork were tainted, the fish rotten, the butter and cheese  corrupted. European wheat and seeds did not mature well. Soon, as  Bradford says in his now famous _Log-Book_, in his picturesque and  forcible English, \"the grim and grizzled face of starvation stared\" at  them. The readiest supply to replenish the scanty larder was fish, but  the English made surprisingly bungling work over fishing, and soon the  most unfailing and valuable supply was the native Indian corn, or  \"Guinny wheat,\" or \"Turkie wheat,\" as it was called by the colonists.    Famine and pestilence had left eastern Massachusetts comparatively bare  of inhabitants at the time of the settlement of Plymouth; and the vacant  cornfields of the dead Indian cultivators were taken and planted by the  weak and emaciated Plymouth men, who never could have cleared new  fields. From the teeming sea, in the April run of fish, was found the  needed fertilizer. Says Governor Bradford:--         \"In April of the first year"]]]
