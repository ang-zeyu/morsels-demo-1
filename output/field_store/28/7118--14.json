Let's fight it out.\"    \"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard. \"They haven't defeated us yet,  and Jim is worth a whole army.\"    But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next  time. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more of  their kind, and they flew straight over Jim's head to where the others  were standing.    The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his  enemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent  place.    Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quivered  and trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escape  again to a distance.    Zeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him. The  top of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard's bullet had  struck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot. Half of  the bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the jar  and the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than the  fact that it was really hurt. Before this crowned Gargoyle had recovered  himself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body, confining  its wings and arms so that it could not move. Then, having tied the  wooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed his  prisoner into the buggy. By that time the others had all retired.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 12.    A WONDERFUL ESCAPE      For a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack. Then a few of them  advanced until another shot from the Wizard's revolver made them  retreat.    \"That's fine,\" said Zeb. \"We've got 'em on the run now, sure enough.\"    \"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily.  \"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone we  shall be helpless.\"    The Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their band  time after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the  little man's revolvers. In this way none of them was shocked by the  dreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away and  each time a new company was sent into the battle. When the Wizard had  fired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy  except to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victory  than in the beginning of the fray.    [Illustration: THE WIZARD FIRED INTO THE THRONG.]    \"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.    \"Let's yell--all together,\" said Zeb.    \"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard. \"We will get near Jim,  so that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do the  best he can. I'll use my sword, although it isn't much account in this  affair. Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the  wooden folks attack her. I haven't anything for you, Zeb.\"    \"I'll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of the  buggy. The bound Gargoyle's arms extended far out beyond its head, so by  grasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club. The boy  was strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so he  was likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard.    When the next company of Gargoyles advanced, our adventurers began  yelling as if they had gone mad. Even the kitten gave a dreadfully  shrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly.  This daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out of  breath. Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more of  the awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced in  a swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them.    Dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearly  covered her and proved a great protection. The Wizard's sword-blade  snapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the  wooden people. Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club  until he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clustered  so thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his  arms. The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eureka  assisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bit  at them like a wild-cat.    But all this bravery amounted to nothing at all. The wooden things wound  their long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast. Dorothy  was captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles clung to  Jim's legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless.  Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground  like a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her  before she had gone very far.    All of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to their  surprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them  far away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to a  wooden city. The houses of this city had many corners, being square and  six-sided and eight-sided. They were tower-like in shape and the best of  them seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial.    To one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only one  broad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were brought by  their captors. The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening, where  there was a platform, and then flew away and left them. As they had no  wings the strangers could not fly away, and if they jumped down from  such a height they would surely be killed. The creatures had sense  enough to reason that way, and the only mistake they made was in  supposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinary  difficulties.    Jim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoyles  to carry the big beast through the air and land him on the high  platform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged to  the party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for or  whether it was alive or not. When Eureka's captor had thrown the kitten  after the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving our  friends to breathe freely once more.    \"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in little  gasps.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with her  paw; \"we didn't manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us.\"    \"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" sighed  the little girl.    \"I wonder why they didn't kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who had  lost his king in the struggle.    \"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,  reflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as  possible in a short time.\"    \"As dead as poss'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn't it?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes, my dear. But we have no need to worry about that just now. Let us  examine our prison and see what it is like.\"    The space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to see  on all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosity  at the city spread out beneath them. Everything visible was made of  wood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural.    From their platform a stair descended into the house, and the children  and the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the  way. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothing  more; so after a time they came back to the platform again. Had there  been any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of  the house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but to  remain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, and  they did not like the darkness or the damp smell.    In this country, as in all others they had visited underneath the  earth's surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light coming  from some unknown source. Looking out, they could see into some of the  houses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and were  able to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their  dwellings.    \"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard. \"All people  need rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no night here  they select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze.\"    \"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning.    \"Why, where's Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly.    They all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen.    \"She's gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly.    \"Where? On the roof?\" asked the girl.    \"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of  this house to the ground.\"    \"She couldn't climb _down_, Jim,\" said Dorothy. \"To climb means to go  up.\"    \"Who said so?\" demanded the horse.    \"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim.\"    \"To 'climb down' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked the  Wizard.    \"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she _went_ down,  anyhow, whether she climbed or crept.\"    \"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed.  \"The Gurgles will get her, sure!\"    \"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they're not 'Gurgles,' little  maid; they're Gargoyles.\"    \"Never mind; they'll get Eureka, whatever they're called.\"    \"No they won't,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herself  crawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the  floor.    \"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" asked Dorothy, sternly.    \"Watching the wooden folks. They're too funny for anything, Dorothy.

[Illustration: Coin.]  Dollar of 1794.  The First United States Coin.  \"Liberty\"  \"1794\"  \"United States of America\"      We also needed a complete system of courts, departments for foreign and  Indian affairs, and an efficient executive. The single vote for each  State was unfair, allowing one-third of the people to defeat the will of  the rest. The article requiring the consent of nine States made it  almost impossible to get important measures through Congress. Delegates  should not have been paid by their respective States. In consequence of  this provision, coupled with other things, Congress decreased in numbers  and importance. In November, 1783, less than twenty delegates were  present, representing but seven States, and Congress had to appeal to  the recreant States to send back their representatives before the treaty  of peace could be ratified.    [1787]    But the one grand defect of the Confederation, underlying all others,  was lack of power. The Government was an engine without steam. The  States, just escaped from the tyranny of a king, would brook no new  authority strong enough to endanger their liberties. The result was a  thin ghost of a government set in charge over a lot of lusty  flesh-and-blood States.    The Confederation, however, did one piece of solid work worthy of  everlasting praise. The Northwest Territory, embracing what is now Ohio,  Indiana. Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had been ceded to the Union  by the States which originally claimed it. July 13, 1787, Congress  adopted for the government of the territory the famous Ordinance of  1787. It provided for a governor, council, and judges, to be appointed  by Congress, and a house of representatives elected by the people. Its  shining excellence was a series of compacts between the States and the  territory, which guaranteed religious liberty, made grants of land and  other liberal provisions for schools and colleges, and forever  prohibited slavery in the territory or the States which should be made  out of it. Thus were laid broad and deep the foundation for the full and  free development of humanity in a region larger than the whole German  Empire.    The passing of the Ordinance was probably due in large measure to the  influence of the Ohio Company, a colonist society organized in Boston  the year before. It was composed of the flower of the Revolutionary  army, and had wealth, energy, and intelligence. When its agent appeared  before Congress to arrange for the purchase of five million acres of  land in the Ohio Valley, a bill for the government of the territory,  containing neither the antislavery clause nor the immortal principles of  the compacts, was on the eve of passage. The Company, composed mostly of  Massachusetts men, strongly desired their future home to be upon free  soil. Their influence prevailed with Congress, eager for revenue from  the sale of lands, and even the Southern members voted unanimously for  the remodelled ordinance. The establishment of a strong and enlightened  government in the territory led to its rapid settlement. Marietta, 0.,  was founded in April, 1788, and other colonies followed in rapid  succession.        CHAPTER X.    RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION    [1787]    The anarchy succeeding the Revolution was as sad as the Revolution  itself had been glorious. The Articles of Confederation furnished  practically no government with which foreign nations could deal; England  still clung to the western posts, contrary to the treaty of peace, with  no power anywhere on this side to do more than protest; the debt of the  confederacy steadily piled up its unpaid interest; the land was flooded  with irredeemable paper money, state and national; the confederacy's  laws and constitution were ignored or trampled upon everywhere; and the  arrogance and self-seeking of the several States surpassed everything  but their own contemptible weakness.    In 1786 Shays' rebellion broke out in Massachusetts. Solid money was  very scarce, and paper all but worthless, yet many debts contracted on a  paper basis were pressed for payment in hard money. The farmers swore  that the incidence of taxes upon them was excessive, and upon the  merchants too light. But the all-powerful grievance was the sudden  change from the distressing monetary injustice during the Revolution,  with the consequent increase of debts, to a rigid enforcement of  debtors' claims afterward. At this period men were imprisoned for debt,  and all prisons were frightful holes, which one would as lief die as  enter. Meetings were held to air the popular griefs, and grew violent.    In August the court-house at Northampton was seized by a body of armed  men and the court prevented from sitting. Similar uprisings occurred at  Worcester, Springfield, and Concord. The leader in these movements was  Daniel Shays, a former captain in the continental army. Governor Bowdoin  finally called for volunteers to put down the rebellion, and placed  General Lincoln in command. After several minor engagements, in which  the insurgents were worsted, the decisive action took place at  Petersham, where, in February, 1787, the rebels were surprised by  Lincoln. A large number were captured, many more fled to their homes,  and the rest withdrew into the neighboring States. Vermont and Rhode  Island alone offered them a peaceful retreat, the other States giving up  the fugitives to Massachusetts.      [Illustration: Crowd watching two men fighting.]  A Scene at Springfield, during Shays' Rebellion, when the  mob attempted to prevent the holding of the Courts of Justice.      The Shays commotion, for a long time shaking one of the stanchest States  in the Confederation, well showed the need of a far stronger central  government than the old had been or could be made. Other influences  concurred to the same conviction. Washington's influence, which took  effect mainly through his inspired letter to the States on leaving the  army, was one of these. National feeling was also furthered by the  spread of two religious sects, the Baptists and the Methodists, up and  down the continent, whose missionary preachers, ignoring State lines and  prejudices, helped to destroy the latter in their hearers.    [1785]    During the Revolution, American Methodism had been an appanage of  England.  Wesley had discountenanced our effort at independence, and  when war broke out, all the Methodist preachers left the country, save  Asbury, who secreted himself somewhere in Delaware, waiting for better  days. But in 1784 this zealous body of Christians was organized as an  American affair, its clergy and laity after this displaying loyalty of  the most approved kind.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Wesley.      Schemes had been mooted looking to a changed political order. A  proposition for a convention of the States to reform the Confederation  passed the New York Legislature in July, 1782, under the influence of  Alexander Hamilton; another passed that of Massachusetts, July, 1785,  urged by Governor Bowdoin; but because of too great love for state  independence and too little appreciation as yet of the serious nature of  the crisis, both motions failed of effect.    The idea of reform which found most favor, the only one which at first  had any chance of getting itself realized, was that of giving Congress  simply the additional power of regulating commerce. Even so moderate a  proposal as this had many enemies, especially in the South. Greatly to  her credit therefore as a Southern State, the purpose of amending the  old Articles in the direction indicated was first taken up in earnest by  Virginia. Her Legislature, soon after opening session in October, 1785,  listened to memorials from Norfolk, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Alexandria,  upon the gloomy prospects of American trade, which led to a general  debate upon the subject. In this, Mr. Madison, by a speech far exceeding  in ability any other that was made, began that extended and memorable  career of efforts for enlarged function in our central government which  has earned him the title of the Father of the Constitution.    The result of this discussion was a bill directing the Virginia  delegation in Congress to propose amendment to the constitution giving  to Congress the needed additional power. The enemies of the bill,  however, succeeded in so modifying it by limiting the proposed grant of  power to a period of thirteen years, that Madison and its other abettors  turned against it and voted to lay it on the table.    There was in existence at this very time  a joint commission  representing Virginia and Maryland, which had been raised for the  purpose of determining what jurisdiction each of the two States had over  the Potomac and in Chesapeake Bay. Madison was one of the Virginia  commissioners. A meeting had been held on March 17, 1785, at which the  commissioners agreed in their report to transcend their instructions and  to recommend to the two States uniform monetary and commercial  regulations entire, including common export and import duties. They thus  reported, adding the still further recommendation that commissioners to  work out the details of such a plan be appointed each year till it  should be completed. The Maryland Legislature adopted the report, adding  the proposition that Delaware and Pennsylvania also should be invited to  enter the system and to send commissioners.    When the commissioners' report, with Maryland's action thereon, came  before the Virginia Legislature, Madison moved, as a substitute for the  mutilated bill which had been tabled previously, that the invitation to  take part in the commission go to all the States. The motion passed by a  large majority.    [1786]    Thus originated the Annapolis Convention of 1786. Nine States appointed  delegates; all but Connecticut, Maryland, and the two Carolinas; but of  the nine only Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,"]]]
