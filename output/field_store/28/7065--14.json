Think I'm a thief?\"    \"I didn't say that, sir; but so sure as you don't go home, they'll think  you've cut away.\"    \"Jem!\" cried Don in a despairing voice, as he recalled the bundle he had  made up, and the drawer left open.    \"Well, sir, you was allus a-wanting to go abroad, and get away from the  desk,\" said Jem ill-naturedly--\"oh, how my head do ache!--and now you've  got your chance.\"    \"But that was all nonsense, Jem.  I was only thinking then like a  stupid, discontented boy.  I don't want to go.  What will they say?\"    \"Dunno what they'll say,\" said Jem dolefully, \"but I know what my Sally  will say.  I used to talk about going and leaving her, but that was  because I too was a hidyut.  I didn't want to go and leave her, poor  little lass.  Too fond on her, Mas' Don.  She only shows a bit o'  temper.\"    \"Jem, she'll think you've run away and deserted her.\"    \"Safe, Mas' Don.  You see, I made up a bundle o' wittles as if I was  a-going, and she saw me take it out under my arm, and she called to me  to stop, but I wouldn't, because I was so waxy.\"    \"And I made up a bundle too, Jem.  I--I did half think of going away.\"    \"Then you've done it now, my lad.  My Sally will think I've forsook  her.\"    \"And they at home will think of me as a thief.  Oh, fool--fool--fool!\"    \"What's the use o' calling yourself a fool, Mas' Don, when you means me  all the time?  Oh, my head, my head!\"    \"Jem, we must escape.\"    \"Escape?  I on'y wish we could.  Oh, my head: how it do ache.\"    \"They will take us off to the tender, and then away in some ship, and  they will not know at home where we are gone Jem, get up.\"    \"What's the good, sir?  My head feels like feet, and if I tried to stand  up I should go down flop!\"    \"Let me help you, Jem.  Here, give me your hand.  How dark it is?  Where's your hand?\"    \"Gently, my lad; that's my hye.  Arn't much use here in the dark, but  may want 'em by-and-by.  That's better.  Thank ye, sir.  Here, hold  tight.\"    \"Can't you stand, Jem?\"    \"Stand, sir?  Yes: but what's the matter?  It's like being in a  round-about at the fair.\"    \"You'll be better soon.\"    \"Better, sir?  Well, I can't be worse.  Oh, my head, my head!  I wish  I'd got him as did it headed up in one of our barrels, I'd give him such  a roll up and down the ware'us floor as 'ud make him as giddy as me.\"    \"Now try and think, Jem,\" said Don excitedly.  \"They must not believe at  home that we are such cowards as to run away.\"    \"No, sir; my Sally mustn't think that.\"    \"Then what shall we do?\"    \"Try to get out, sir, of course.\"    \"Can you walk?\"    \"Well, sir, if I can't, I'll crawl.  What yer going to do?\"    \"Try the door.  Perhaps they have left it unlocked.\"    \"Not likely,\" said Jem.  \"Wish I'd got a candle.  It's like being a rat  in a box trap.  It _is_ dark.\"    \"This way, Jem.  Your hand.\"    \"All right, sir.  Frontards: my hands don't grow out o' my back.\"    \"That's it.  Now together.  Let's get to the wall.\"    There was a rustling noise and then a rattle.    \"Phew!  Shins!\" cried Jem.  \"Oh, dear me.  That's barrel staves, I know  the feel on 'em.  Such sharp edges, Mas' Don.  Mind you don't tread on  the edge of a hoop, or it'll fly up and hit you right in the middle.\"    _Flip_!    \"There, I told you so.  Hurt you much, my lad?\"    \"Not very much, Jem.  Now then; feel your way with me.  Let's go all  round the place, perhaps there's another way out.\"    \"All right, sir.  Well, it might be, but I say as it couldn't be darker  than this if you was brown sugar, and shut up in a barrel in the middle  o' the night.\"    \"Now I am touching the wall, Jem,\" said Don.  \"I'm going to feel all  round.  Can you hear anything?\"    \"Only you speaking, my lad.\"    \"Come along then.\"    \"All right, Mas' Don.  My head aches as if it was a tub with the cooper  at work hammering of it.\"    Don went slowly along the side of the great cellar, guiding himself in  the intense darkness by running: his hands over the damp bricks; but  there was nothing but bare wall till he had passed down two sides, and  was half-way along the third, when he uttered a hasty ejaculation.    \"It's all right, Jem.  Here is a way into another cellar.\"    \"Mind how you go, sir.  Steady.\"    \"Yes, but make haste.\"    \"There's a door,\" whispered Don.  \"Loose my hand.\"    He hastily felt all over the door, but it was perfectly blank, not so  much as a keyhole to be found, and though he pressed and strained at it,  he could make no impression.    \"It's no use, Jem.  Let's try the other door.\"    \"I don't believe there are no other door,\" said Jem.  \"That's the way  out.\"    \"No, no; the way out is on the other side.\"    \"This here is t'other side,\" said Jem, \"only we arn't over there now.\"    \"I'm sure it can't be.\"    \"And I'm sure it can be, my lad.  Nothing arn't more puzzling than being  shut up in the dark.  You loses yourself directly, and then you can't  find yourself again.\"    \"But the door where the men went out is over there.\"    \"Yah!  That it arn't,\" cried Jem.  \"Don't throw your fisties about that  how.  That's my nose.\"    \"I'm very sorry, Jem.  I did not mean--\"    \"Course you didn't, but that's what I said.  When you're in the dark you  don't know where you are, nor where any one else is.\"    \"Let's try down that other side, and I'll show you that you are wrong.\"    \"Can't show me, my lad.  You may make me feel, but you did that just now  when you hit me on the nose.  Well?  Fun' it?\"    \"No, not yet,\" said Don, as he crept slowly along from the doorway; and  then carefully on and on, till he must have come to the place from which  they started.    \"No, not yet,\" grumbled Jem.  \"Nor more you won't if you go on for  ever.\"    \"I'm afraid you're right, Jem.\"    \"I'm right, and I arn't afraid,\" said Jem; \"leastwise, save that my  head's going on aching for ever.\"    Don felt all round the cellar again, and then heaved a sigh.    \"Yes; there's only one door, Jem.  Could we break it down?\"    \"I could if I'd some of the cooper's tools,\" said Jem, quietly; \"but you  can't break strong doors with your fisties, and you can't get out of  brick cellars with your teeth.\"    \"Of course, we're underground.\"    \"Ay!  No doubt about that, Mas' Don.\"    \"Let's knock and ask for a pencil and paper to send a message.\"    Jem uttered a loud chuckle as he seated himself on the floor.    \"I like that, Mas' Don.  'Pon my word I do.  Might just as well hit your  head again the wall.\"    \"Better use yours for a battering ram, Jem,\" said Don, angrily.  \"It's  thicker than mine.\"    There was silence after this.    \"He's sulky because of what I've said,\" thought Don.    \"Oh, my poor head!\" thought Jem.  \"How it do ache!\"    Then he began to think about Sally, and what she would say or do when  she found that he did not come back.    Just at the same time Don was reflecting upon his life of late, and how  discontented he had been, and how he had longed to go away, while now he  felt as if he would give anything to be back on his old stool in the  office, writing hard, and trying his best to be satisfied with what  seemed to be a peaceful, happy life.    A terrible sensation of despair came over him, and the idea of being  dragged off to a ship, and carried right away, was unbearable.  What  were glorious foreign lands with their wonders to one who would be  thought of as a cowardly thief?    As he leaned against a wall there in the darkness his busy brain  pictured his stern-looking uncle telling his weeping mother that it was  a disgrace to her to mourn over the loss of a son who could be guilty of  such a crime, and then run away to avoid his punishment.    \"Oh!  If I had only been a little wiser,\" thought Don, \"how much happier  I might have been.\"    Then he forced himself to think out a way of escape, a little further  conversation with Jem making him feel that he must depend upon himself,  for poor Jem's injury seemed to make him at times confused; in fact, he  quite startled his fellow-prisoner by exclaiming suddenly,--    \"Now where did I put them keys?\"    \"Jem!\"    \"Eh?  All right, Sally.  'Tarn't daylight yet.\"    \"Jem, my lad, don't you know where you are?\"    \"Don't I tell you?  Phew!  My head.  You there, Mas' Don?\"    \"Yes, Jem.  How are you?\"    \"Oh, lively, sir, lively; been asleep, I think.  Keep a good heart, Mas'  Don, and--\"    \"Hist!  Here they come,\" cried Don, as he saw the gleam of a light  through the cracks of the door.  \"Jem, do you think you could make a  dash of it as soon as they open the door?\"    \"No, Mas' Don, not now.  My head's all of a boom-whooz, and I seem to  have no use in my legs.\"    \"Oh!\" ejaculated Don despairingly.    \"But never you mind me, my lad.  You make a run for it, dive down low as  soon as the door's open.  That's how to get away.\"    _Cling_! _clang_!    Two bolts were shot back and a flood--or after the intense darkness what  seemed to be a flood--of light flashed into the cellar, as the bluff man  entered with another bearing the lanthorn.  Then there was a great deal  of shuffling of feet as if heavy loads were being borne down some stone  steps; and as Don looked eagerly at the party, it was to see four  sailors, apparently wounded, perhaps dead, carried in and laid upon the  floor.    A thrill of horror ran through Don.  He had heard of the acts of the  press-gangs as he might have heard of any legend, and then they had  passed from his mind; but now all this was being brought before him and  exemplified in a way that was terribly real.  These four men just  carried in were the last victims of outrage, and his indignation seemed  to be boiling up within him when the bluff-looking man said  good-humouredly,--    \"That's the way to get them, my lad.  Those four fellows made themselves  tipsy and went to sleep, merchant sailors; they'll wake up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#14)"],[1,"being the  consequence of the unsatisfactory results of the communications between  the parties.  They met at a place called Knot's Hole, near the shore by  the Aigburth-road.  Mr. Sparling was attended by Captain Colquitt,  commanding the _Princess_ frigate, then in the river.  Mr. Grayson's  second was Dr. MacCartney.  After the fatal shots were fired Mr.  Grayson's servant found his master alone, lying on the ground with his  face downwards.  He was desperately wounded in the thigh, and was taken  back to Liverpool as quickly as possible.  He lingered until the  following Sunday, when he died.  Mr. Sparling and Captain Colquitt were,  at the coroner's inquest, found guilty of murder, and were tried at  Lancaster, on the 4th of April, before Sir Alan Chambre.  Sergeant  Cockle, Attorney-General for the County Palatine of Lancaster, led for  the crown; with him were Messrs. Clark and Scarlett (afterwards Sir  James); attorneys, Messrs. Ellames and Norris.  For the prisoners,  Messrs. Park (afterwards Baron Park), Wood, Topping, Raincock, and Heald;  attorney, Mr. William Statham.    It came out in evidence during the trial, that the hour of meeting was  seven o'clock on Sunday morning, February 24th.  Mr. Sparling and Captain  Colquitt arrived first at Park Chapel; on alighting the Captain carried  the pistol-case, and the two gentlemen went through a gate into a field  opposite, to the place of rendezvous.  Soon after Dr. MacCartney and Mr.  Park, the surgeon, arrived in a carriage.  Mr. Park had been induced to  accompany the Doctor on the representation that he was about to attend a  patient of some consequence, and required his (Mr. Park's) advice and  skill.  Soon after Mr. Grayson arrived on foot, attended by his servant,  when, finding the two gentlemen in waiting, he pulled out his watch, and  remarked that he feared he was rather late, but that it was all his  servant's fault.  Dr. MacCartney then took out the pistol-case from the  carriage (leaving Mr. Park in it, who had declined proceeding any  further), and with Mr. Grayson passed through the same gate as did Mr.  Sparling and the Captain.  They then went down the field towards the  river, and soon afterwards a shot or shots were heard by Mr. Park, Mr.  Grayson's servant, and the post-boys.  Mr. Grayson's servant ran into the  field, and met Mr. Sparling and Captain Colquitt hurrying up the  foot-road, the former asked him \"what he wanted?\" he told him who he was,  when Mr. Sparling informed him his master was severely wounded.  The two  gentlemen then ran onward when they met Mr. Park, who had got out of the  carriage on seeing them coming towards the road in such a hurry.  They  bade him \"make haste, for Grayson was badly wounded.\"  They then got into  their carriage and told the coachman to drive back to Liverpool.  The  other driver asserted he heard Captain Colquitt say, \"by G---, it has  done me good.\"  The two gentlemen were driven first to Mr. Ralph Benson's  in Duke-street, to whom a message was sent up that Mr. Sparling \"had been  in the country and was quite well.\"  They next called on Mr. Stavert,  when Mr. Sparling said, \"I have put a ball into Grayson this morning.\"  Mr. Stavert replied, \"I hope he is not much hurt,\" when Mr. Sparling  exclaimed, \"I think not, for he made too much noise for it to be of any  consequence.\"  They were next driven to the Royal Hotel and thence to the  Pier Slip, where a boat was in waiting, in which they were rowed off.    Mr. Park, on hurrying forward to Knot's Hole, found Mr. Grayson supported  by his servant and Dr. MacCartney.  His breeches were soaked with blood  at his right thigh.  There appeared to be a shot-hole at the upper part  near the hip.  He complained of being in acute pain, and that he had lost  the use of his limbs; he said he could no longer stand, but must be  allowed to sit down.  The party, however, bore him to the carriage, and  got him home as soon as possible.  Mr. Park attended him until he died.  The ball had perforated the thigh-bone, and was not extracted until after  death.  It was produced in court.    Mr. Grayson was fully aware of his approaching end.  On the Wednesday  after the duel, he told Mr. Park that \"he was going to meet his God.\"  On  the following day he said that \"he hoped for mercy, and that he might  have gone with greater guilt on his head, if he had killed Sparling,  instead of Sparling killing him\"; and added, \"whatever his opinions of  Mr. Sparling's conduct might be, he truly forgave him the injury he had  done him, in giving him his death-wound, and hoped, in the event of his  decease, that his friends would not prosecute him.\"  Mr. Grayson  repeatedly said Mr. Sparling was an utter stranger to him, and that he  did not know him even by sight.    At that time counsel were not allowed to make any appeal to a jury for a  prisoner.  Mr. Sparling's defence was therefore read by one of his  counsel, Mr. Park.  It was very ably got up.  He bitterly protested  against the outcry that had been made against him in public, from the  pulpit and by the press.  He wholly denied bearing any malice towards Mr.  Grayson, and justified himself, declaring his act was a mere vindication  of his honour and good name, and that he had, in conjunction with Captain  Colquitt, repeatedly asked Mr. Grayson to withdraw his insulting words  and threatening speeches, but without avail, and the meeting was the  consequence of his obstinacy.  He said of Mr. Grayson, as Mr. Grayson had  said of him, that he was an utter stranger to him.  Captain Colquitt made  an able defence, wherein he justified himself and his conduct.  A number  of gentlemen of high character and distinction spoke to the kindliness of  manner of Mr. Sparling at all times, and also of Captain Colquitt, and  completely exonerated them from the imputation of entertaining vindictive  or malevolent feelings.  Amongst others who appeared for Mr. Sparling  were Sir Hungerford Hoskins, Captain Palmer, Rev. Jonathan Brooks, His  Worship the Mayor (William Harper, Esq.), Soloman D'Aguilar, Lord  Viscount Carleton, Major-General Cartwright, Lord Robert Manners, Lord  Charles Manners, Lord James Murray, Colonel M'Donald, and Major Seymour.  For Captain Colquitt many equally honourable gentlemen and officers in  His Majesty's service gave evidence in his favour.    The judge on summing up decidedly leaned towards the prisoners, and the  result was a verdict of \"Not Guilty.\"  The same jury was afterwards  empanelled to try Mr. Sparling, Captain Colquitt, and Dr. MacCartney on  another indictment, but no evidence being brought forward, they were all  acquitted.    Thus terminated a trial which created an immense amount of interest, not  only in Liverpool, but throughout the whole of the northern counties.    Before I relate the incidents of the second duel that took place in  Liverpool, I will briefly give the particulars of another affair, which  happened in the same year (July, 1804), which gave the gossips and _quid  nuncs_ of the town ample food for conversation.  This was the  court-martial on Captain Carmichael, the Adjutant of Colonel Earle's  regiment of Fusiliers, and formerly adjutant of Colonel Bolton's regiment  of \"Royal Liverpool Volunteers.\"  He was charged with \"disobedience of  orders, and with addressing Colonel Earle in abusive and scandalous  language respecting the officers of the regiment.\"  The court-martial was  held by virtue of a warrant from His Royal Highness Prince William  Frederick of Gloucester, the General commanding the district.  The  president was Colonel Bolton; the judge-advocate, Fletcher Raincock,  Esq., barrister-at-law.    It appeared that on the 12th of June the Fusiliers were drilling on  Copperas-hill (fancy _our_ Volunteers drilling on Copperas-hill!), at the  manual and platoon exercise, when they were commanded to \"order arms\" and  \"stand at ease\" by the Colonel; his intention being to keep the regiment  for the remainder of the morning at firelock exercise.  Something was  said of a private nature by Colonel Earle to the Adjutant Carmichael,  who, instead of replying, took no notice of the observation.  He  subsequently spoke to the Colonel in an insulting and impertinent manner,  treating him at the same time with marked indignity--calling out, loud  enough for the men to hear, \"that he insisted upon the officers being  called together to inquire into his conduct, for such things were said of  him as he could not bear.\"  On being told that that was not the time nor  place to bring charges against the officers, and that he should put down  in writing what he had to say, and he would then be attended to, he did  not seem satisfied, but continued to demand the calling of the officers  together.  Colonel Earle told him to go on with his duty.  Captain  Carmichael still took no notice of these orders; but said his feelings  were \"worked up to a fiddle-string.\"  Still disobeying Colonel Earle's  commands, he was told \"to go home if he could not do his duty.\"  He was  then heard to say that the officers, or some of the officers, were \"a set  of blacklegs.\"  For this offence Captain Carmichael was tried.  He denied  at first the right of the court to sit in judgment upon him, and raised  three objections, two of which were read, and the third was stopped in  the middle, being overruled by the court.  The court-martial sat five  days, and the result of it was that Captain Carmichael was acquitted of  disobedience, but found guilty of addressing abusive language to his  commanding-officer.  His sentence was \"to be reprimanded at the head of  his regiment.\"  Colonel Bolton was delegated to administer this reproof.  Colonel Bolton spoke highly in the Captain's favour, and stated that he  had presented him with a piece of plate which he had bought for him when  in London, to mark his respect for him, and his efficiency in drilling  his (Colonel Bolton's) regiment.
