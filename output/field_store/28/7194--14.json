[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#14)"],[1,"the issue of the New York _World_, bearing date Saturday, May 11,  1867, appeared a long article criticising, exposing, and severely  condemning the methods of the city's detective police. \"A detective,\"  said the writer, \"is presumed to be alike active, capable and honest,  and were he such, he would be a public benefactor; but as he is too  often either ignorant, indolent, or positively dishonest, he becomes a  public pest. That detectives are in league with thieves; that they  associate with them publicly and privately on the most intimate terms;  that they occasionally 'put up' jobs with them by which the people are  alike fleeced and astonished; that although the perpetrators of great  robberies are generally known to them, the said perpetrators almost  invariably escape punishment; that far more attention is paid to the  sharing of the plunder, or the obtaining of a large percentage on the  amount of money recovered, than to the furtherance of the ends of  justice--all these statements are undeniably true.\"    Coming to specific charges, the writer said further on: \"A handsome  female, a Broadway shop-lifter, recently testified that although she had  been desirous of reforming her life for a year past, she had been  totally prevented from so doing by the extortions of certain members of  the detective force, who threatened to reveal her former history unless  she 'came down handsomely,' and in order to 'come down,' as they styled  it, she was obliged to resort to her old disgraceful business.\"    The foregoing reference to a concurrent incident was presented to the  reader as coldly and curtly as a historic hailstone, striking him but to  glance off, and not like a real, breathing story, as it was, appealing  strongly to his heart. The following facts, which have been kept  inviolate in this office for nearly twenty years, and only brought to  light here because those most concerned have passed away, will show what  a stirring and pathetic narrative lay beneath the newspaper chronicler's  dry words.    Early in the spring of the year above named, an elderly gentleman of  undoubted respectability was shown into our private office. He was  exceedingly nervous and flurried, and his wan, colorless face looked  like an effaced page. In a tortuous, round-about way, he intimated that  his married daughter was in great trouble, in consequence of the  operation of a great weakness or defect in character which was  apparently hereditary. Her mother, his wife, he said, an excellent,  kind-hearted, conscientious, truthful woman, had occasionally manifested  the kleptomania impulse and had been detected. Happily the crime had  been committed under circumstances which obviated exposure; it had been  charitably overlooked upon his paying the bill for the purloined goods.  Up to the date of her marriage, he had not observed or otherwise become  cognizant of the development of the unfortunate trait in his only  daughter. Her husband was a noble-minded man who devotedly loved her,  and whom she idolized. Two years after her marriage she was caught  shop-lifting in an establishment where she was known. By a merciful  stroke of fortune, the information and the bill were sent to the father  instead of the husband. Great moral and religious influence had been  brought to bear on her, and for several years there was cause to believe  that she had overcome her weakness. Unfortunately there had been another  lapse into temptation. At present she was suffering the tortures of the  damned, but in what particular respect she had refused to explain to  him. \"Father, find me an active, bold and energetic lawyer,\" she had  said in a paroxysm of tears, \"and I will tell him what I _cannot_ tell  you.\"    The lady came to the office next morning, alone. She was pale as a lily,  and she bore on her forehead that shadow of melancholy which tells all  the world that a woman is suffering and unhappy. Her eyes were dark and  soft as the darkest and softest violet, and she was dressed with the  utmost simplicity. She was in a most desponding mood. She said nothing  was worth striving for any more. There was no good under the sun for  her. The splendor had gone from the grass--the glory from the flower.  Life, affection, family ties, love of good name--all these had ceased to  appeal to her.    In the _sanctum sanctorum_ of a criminal lawyer's office the extremes of  mental agony and poignant suffering are sometimes revealed in all their  phases; but it would be hard to imagine any one suffering more than this  fair, prepossessing woman, as she told how that sleepless and merciless  vulture of remorse, aided by the machinations of a licensed fiend in  human form, dogged her steps by day and made night horrible. The recital  recalled the picture suggested by the lines:      \"Lean abstinence, pole grief and haggard care,  The dire attendants of forlorn despair.\"      With pale, quivering lips, she told the story of her humiliation.  Primarily, some two years after she became a happy wedded wife, she was  impelled by an irresistible impulse to take some article, almost  valueless in itself, from the counter of a dry-goods store. She had been  making several purchases and had plenty of money in her pocket at the  time. Afterwards, as opportunity offered, the wretched larceny was  repeated. Then came discovery, and her father's awakening to the  realization that his daughter was a thief. He summoned a minister and  some worthy Christian women--relatives of his--to talk to her and to  urge her to seek strength from that source where it is never withheld  when earnestly and penitently invoked. She became a church-member,  zealous and earnest in the path of righteousness, partaking regularly of  the Sacred Elements, visiting the sick, relieving the distressed, and  comforting the afflicted. To use Milton's language,      \"Such a sacred and homefelt delight,  Such sober certainty of waking bliss,\"      she had never felt till then. Under these happy conditions five years  passed, and then again during the holiday season, temptation assailed  her and was stronger than she. The person who discovered her theft was a  detective. He did not arrest and expose her. He did worse. He followed  her, obtained an interview and promised to keep her secret if she made  it worth his while. She willingly gave him a sum of money, and expected  to hear no more of him or of her transgression. But this newer edition  of Fagin, who was as vile as the sewers, and who lied like a prospectus,  dogged her movements and systematically shadowed her wherever she went,  again and again demanding money and threatening her with newspaper  publicity. She gave this rapacious vampire all the money she could  procure, even borrowing from her father. The pawnbrokers had in safe  keeping her diamonds, jewels, and some of her furs and laces. They had  been pledged to furnish this licensed black-mailer with money, and still  he was insatiate and unappeased. Her husband's suspicions meanwhile had  been aroused. She spent so much money in occult ways that he had been  impelled to ask her father what he thought L---- was doing with so much  money. Fettered thus, with the torments both of Prometheus and  Tantalus--the vulture gnawing at her vitals, and the lost joys mocking  her out of reach--she had at last in sheer desperation been driven to  request her father to procure her the assistance of a fearless lawyer.    It is not expedient to reveal the _modus operandi_ used in emancipating  this unfortunate lady from her worse than Egyptian bondage. But the  reader may rest assured that through the co-operation of the police  commissioners the shameless scoundrel was dismissed from the police  force. Afterwards, he served a term in a Western state prison, and up to  this hour has been heard no more of in New York.      CHAPTER VIII.    PANEL HOUSES AND PANEL THIEVES.    _The Inmates--The Victims--The Gains--Complete Exposure of the Manner of  Operations, and how Unsuspecting Persons are Robbed._    Some years since respectable New York was startled and horrified by the  recitals of criminal life, which, in the fulfillment of a disagreeable  public duty, the daily newspapers printed in their news columns. The  stirring appeal for the suppression of the evil then made by the press  to the moral sentiment of the community, was backed by the judiciary, by  the money and influence of wealthy and patriotic citizens, by the  various charitable organizations, and by the whole police force.  Consequently, the foul Augean stable of vice and iniquity, for the time  being, at least, was in a great degree cleansed and purified. The  leaders of that foul army of vicious men and women were gradually rooted  out and driven away from their noxious haunts. Some found a congenial  haven in the State prison, a few reformed, and many died in want. The  plague being temporarily stayed, and popular indignation a matter of  record, New York, as is its invariable custom, permitted its vigilance  to go quietly to sleep, with a fair prospect of it being rudely awakened  to find history repeating itself. That this awakening cannot safely be  much longer deferred, it is partly the mission of the present chapter to  show. For it is useless to deny that we have in this city to-day, a  condition of affairs very similar to that which aroused the indignation  and called for the severe repressional measures of our immediate  predecessors. Up-town, in many instances closely contiguous to the  dwellings of people of the highest respectability, there are dens as  vile and infamous as ever disgraced any civilized community. Hardly a  street, however apparently exclusive and fashionable, can boast that it  is free from gambling, prostitution or panel houses.    Some time since, a journalist connected with a prominent morning paper,  took great pains to collect statistics concerning houses of prostitution  in New York. The article in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#14)"],[1,"should have  known that at such an advanced age there are generally some wanting.\" The  next time he came there was a gap in the teeth, and so well done that he  was delighted. This work is now in the Uffizi Gallery.    Lorenzo now sent for the father of Angelo, and asked that the son might  live in the Medici palace under his own care. Somewhat reluctantly the  father consented, and the duke gave him an office in the custom-house.  From this time for three years, Angelo sat daily at the duke's table, and  was treated as one of his own family; he was properly clothed, and had an  allowance of five ducats a month for pocket-money. It was the custom with  Lorenzo to give an entertainment every day; he took the head of the table,  and whoever came first had a seat next him. It often happened that Michael  Angelo had this place. Lorenzo was the head of Florence, and Florence was  the head of art, poetry, and all scholarly thought. Thus, in the home of  the Medici, the young artist heard learned talk upon all subjects of  interest; he saw there all the celebrated men who lived in the city or  visited it, and his life so near Lorenzo, for a thoughtful youth, as he  was, amounted to an education.    The society of Florence at this time was not of a high moral tone, and in  the year in which Michael Angelo entered the palace, a monk called  Savonarola came to Florence to preach against the customs and the crimes  of the city. Michael Angelo was much affected by this, and throughout his  long life remembered Savonarola with true respect and affection, and his  brother, Leonardo Buonarroti, was so far influenced that he withdrew from  the world and became a Dominican monk.    Michael Angelo's diligence was great; he not only studied sculpture, but  he found time to copy some of the fine old frescoes in the Church of the  Carmine. He gave great attention to the study of anatomy, and he was known  throughout the city for his talents, and for his pride and bad temper. He  held himself aloof from his fellow-pupils, and one day, in a quarrel with  Pietro Torrigiano, the latter gave Angelo a blow and crushed his nose so  badly that he was disfigured for life. Torrigiano was banished for this  offence and went to England; he ended his life in a Spanish prison.    In the spring of 1492 Lorenzo de Medici died. Michael Angelo was deeply  grieved at the loss of his best friend; he left the Medici palace, and  opened a studio in his father's house, where he worked diligently for two  years, making a statue of Hercules and two madonnas. After two years there  came a great snow-storm, and Piero de Medici sent for the artist to make a  snow statue in his court-yard. He also invited Michael Angelo to live  again in the palace, and the invitation was accepted; but all was so  changed there that he embraced the first opportunity to leave, and during  a political disturbance fled from the city with two friends, and made his  way to Venice. There he met the noble Aldovrandi of Bologna, who invited  the sculptor to his home, where he remained about a year, and then  returned to his studio in Florence.    Soon after this he made a beautiful, sleeping Cupid, and when the young  Lorenzo de Medici saw it he advised Michael Angelo to bury it in the  ground for a season, and thus make it look like an antique marble; after  this was done, Lorenzo sent it to Rome and sold it to the Cardinal Riario,  and gave the sculptor thirty ducats. In some way the truth of the matter  reached the ears of the Cardinal, who sent his agent to Florence to find  the artist. When Michael Angelo heard that two hundred ducats had been  paid for his Cupid, he knew that he had been deceived. The Cardinal's  agent invited him to go to Rome, and he gladly went. The oldest existing  writing from the hand of Michael Angelo is the letter which he wrote to  Lorenzo to inform him of his arrival in Rome. He was then twenty-one years  old, and spoke with joy of all the beautiful things he had seen.    Not long after he reached Rome he made the statue of the \"Drunken  Bacchus,\" now in the Uffizi Gallery, and then the Virgin Mary sitting near  the place of the cross and holding the body of the dead Christ. The  art-term for this subject is \"La Pieta.\" From the time that Michael Angelo  made this beautiful work he was the first sculptor of the world, though he  was but twenty-four years old. The Pieta was placed in St. Peter's Church,  where it still remains. The next year he returned to Florence. He was  occupied with both painting and sculpture, and was soon employed on his  \"David,\" one of his greatest works. This statue weighed eighteen thousand  pounds, and its removal from the studio in which it was made to the place  where it was to stand, next the gate of the Palazzo Vecchio, was a  difficult undertaking. It was at last put in place on May 18, 1504; there  it remained until a few years ago, when, on account of its crumbling from  the effect of the weather, it was removed to the Academy of Fine Arts by  means of a railroad built for the purpose.    About this time a rivalry sprang up between Michael Angelo and Leonardo da  Vinci. They were very unlike in their characters and mode of life. Michael  Angelo was bitter, ironical, and liked to be alone; Leonardo loved to be  gay and to see the world; Michael Angelo lived so that when he was old he  said, \"Rich as I am, I have always lived like a poor man;\" Leonardo  enjoyed luxury, and kept a fine house, with horses and servants. They had  entered into a competition which was likely to result in serious trouble,  when Pope Julius II. summoned Michael Angelo to Rome. The Pope gave him an  order to build him a splendid tomb; but the enemies of the sculptor made  trouble for him, and one morning he was refused admission to the Pope's  palace. He then left Rome, sending this letter to the Pope: \"Most Holy  Father, I was this morning driven from the palace by the order of your  Holiness. If you require me in future you can seek me elsewhere than at  Rome.\"    Then he went to Florence, and the Pope sent for him again and again; but  he did not go. Meantime he finished his design, and received the  commission that he and Leonardo had striven for, which was to decorate the  hall of the Grand Council with pictures. At last, in 1506, the Pope was in  Bologna, and again sent for Michael Angelo. He went, and was forgiven for  his offence, and received an order for a colossal statue of the Pope in  bronze. When this was finished in 1508, and put before the Church of St.  Petronio, Michael Angelo returned to Florence. He had not made friends in  Bologna; his forbidding manner did not encourage others to associate with  him; but we now know from his letters that he had great trials. His family  was poor, and all relied on him; indeed, his life was full of care and  sadness.    In 1508 he was again summoned to Rome by the Pope, who insisted that he  should paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican. Michael  Angelo did not wish to do this, as he had done no great painting. It  proved to be one of his most famous works; but he had a great deal of  trouble in it. On one occasion the Pope threatened to throw the artist  from the scaffolding. The Pope complained also that the pictures looked  poor; to this the artist replied: \"They are only poor people whom I have  painted there, and did not wear gold on their garments.\" His subjects were  from the Bible. When the artist would have a leave of absence to go to  Florence, the Pope got so angry that he struck him; but, in spite of all,  this great painting was finished in 1512. Grimm, in his life of Michael  Angelo, says: \"It needed the meeting of these two men; in the one such  perseverance in requiring, and in the other such power of fulfilling, to  produce this monument of human art.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--THE PROPHET JEREMIAH. _By M. Angelo. From the  Sistine Chapel._]    It is impossible here to follow, step by step, the life and works of this  master. Among the other great things which he did are the tomb of Julius  II. in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, of which the famous  statue of Moses makes a part (Fig. 40).    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--STATUE OF MOSES. _By M. Angelo._]    He made the statues in the Medici Chapel in the Church of San Lorenzo, in  Florence, the painting of the Last Judgment on a wall of the Sistine  Chapel, and many works as an architect; for he was called upon to attend  to fortifications both in Florence and Rome, and at last, as his  greatest work of this sort, he was the architect of St. Peter's at Rome.  Many different artists had had a share in this work; but as it now is  Michael Angelo may be counted as its real architect. His works are  numerous and only a small part of them is here mentioned; but I have  spoken of those by which he is most remembered. His life, too, was a  stormy one for many reasons that we have not space to tell. While he lived  there were wars and great changes in Italy; he served also under nine  popes, and during his life thirteen men occupied the papal chair. Besides  being great as a painter, an architect, and a sculptor, he was a poet, and  wrote sonnets well worthy of such a genius as his. His whole life was so  serious and sad that it gives one joy to know that in his old age he  formed an intimate friendship with Vittoria Colonna, a wonderful woman,  who made a sweet return to him for all the tender devotion which he  lavished upon her.    Italians associate the name of Michael Angelo with those of the divine  poet Dante and the painter Raphael, and these three are spoken of as the  three greatest men of their country in what are called the modern days.  Michael Angelo died at Rome in 1564, when eighty-nine years old. He  desired to be buried in Florence; but his friends feared to let this be  known lest the Pope should forbid his removal. He was therefore buried in  the Church of the Holy Apostles; but"]]]
