There is none but me; but let me look;\" and he opened  the door of the lodge, and saw at a little distance the enraged bear  coming on with slow but great leaps. The old man closed the door.    \"Yes,\" said he; \"he is indeed a great manito. My grandchildren, you  will be the cause of my losing my life. You asked my protection, and I  granted it; so now, come what may, I will protect you. When the bear  arrives at the door you must run out at the other end of the lodge.\"    Putting his hand to the side of the lodge where he sat, he took down a  bag, and, opening it, took out of it two small black dogs, which he  placed before him.    \"These are the ones I use when I fight,\" said he, and he commenced  patting with both hands the sides of one of the dogs, which at once  commenced to swell out until it filled the lodge, and it had great  strong teeth. When the dog had attained its full size it growled, and,  springing out at the door, met the bear, which, in another leap, would  have reached the lodge. A terrible combat ensued. The sky rang with  the howls of the monsters. In a little while the second dog took the  field. At the commencement of the battle the brothers, acting on the  advice of the old man, escaped through the opposite side of the lodge.  They had not proceeded far in their flight before they heard the  death-cry of one of the dogs, and soon after that of the other.    \"Well,\" said the leader, \"the old man will soon share their fate, so  run, run! the bear will soon be after us.\"    The brothers started with fresh vigour, for the old man had refreshed  them with food; but the bear very soon came in sight again, and was  evidently fast gaining upon them. Again the leader asked the warriors  if they knew of any way in which to save themselves. All were silent.  Running forward with a yell and a howl, the leader said--    \"I dreamed once that, being in great trouble, an old man, who was a  manito, helped me. We shall soon see his lodge.\"    Taking courage, the brothers still went on, and, after going a short  distance, they saw a lodge. Entering it, they found an old man, whose  protection they claimed, saying that a manito was pursuing them.    \"Eat,\" said the old man, putting meat before them. \"Who is a manito?  There is no manito but me. There is none whom I fear.\"    Then he felt the earth tremble as the bear approached, and, opening  the door of the lodge, he saw it coming. The old man shut the door  slowly, and said--    \"Yes, my grandchildren, you have brought trouble upon me.\"    Taking his medicine sack, he took out some small war-clubs of black  stone, and told the young men to run through the other side of the  lodge. As he handled the clubs they became an enormous size, and the  old man stepped out as the bear reached the door. He struck the beast  with one of his clubs, which broke in pieces, and the bear stumbled.  The old man struck it again with the other club, and that also broke,  but the bear fell insensible. Each blow the old man struck sounded  like a clap of thunder, and the howls of the bear ran along the skies.    The brothers had gone some distance before they looked back. They then  saw that the bear was recovering from the blows. First it moved its  paws, and then they saw it rise to its feet. The old man shared the  fate of the first, for the warriors heard his cries as he was torn in  pieces. Again the monster was in pursuit, and fast overtaking them.  Not yet discouraged, the young men kept on their way, but the bear was  so close to them that the leader once more applied to his brothers,  but they could do nothing.    \"Well,\" said he, \"my dreams will soon be exhausted. After this I have  but one more.\"    He advanced, invoking his guardian spirit to aid him.    \"Once,\" said he, \"I dreamed that, being sorely pressed, I came to a  large lake, on the shore of which was a canoe, partly out of water,  and having ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear,\" he cried, \"we  shall soon get to it.\"    It happened as he had said. Coming to the lake, the warriors found the  canoe with the ten paddles, and immediately took their places in it.  Putting off, they paddled to the centre of the lake, when they saw the  bear on the shore. Lifting itself on its hind-legs, it looked all  around. Then it waded into the water until, losing its footing, it  turned back, and commenced making the circuit of the lake. Meanwhile  the warriors remained stationary in the centre watching the animal's  movements. It travelled round till it came to the place whence it  started. Then it commenced drinking up the water, and the young men  saw a strong current fast setting in towards the bear's mouth. The  leader encouraged them to paddle hard for the opposite shore. This  they had nearly reached, when the current became too strong for them,  and they were drawn back by it, and the stream carried them onwards to  the bear.    Then the leader again spoke, telling his comrades to meet their fate  bravely.    \"Now is the time, Mudjikewis,\" said he, \"to show your prowess. Take  courage, and sit in the bow of the canoe, and, when it approaches the  bear's mouth, try what effect your club will have on the beast's  head.\"    Mudjikewis obeyed, and, taking his place, stood ready to give the  blow, while the leader, who steered, directed the canoe to the open  mouth of the monster.    Rapidly advancing, the canoe was just about to enter the bear's mouth,  when Mudjikewis struck the beast a tremendous blow on the head, and  gave the saw-saw-quan. The bear's limbs doubled under it, and it fell  stunned by the blow, but before Mudjikewis could strike again the  monster sent from its mouth all the water it had swallowed with such  force that the canoe was immediately carried by the stream to the  other side of the lake. Leaving the canoe, the brothers fled, and on  they went till they were completely exhausted. Again they felt the  earth shake, and, looking back, saw the monster hard after them. The  young men's spirits drooped, and they felt faint-hearted. With words  and actions the leader exerted himself to cheer them, and once more he  asked them if they could do nothing, or think of nothing, that might  save them. All were silent as before.    \"Then,\" said he, \"this is the last time I can apply to my guardian  spirit. If we do not now succeed, our fate is decided.\"    He ran forward, invoking his spirit with great earnestness, and gave  the yell.    \"We shall soon arrive,\" said he to his brothers, \"at the place where  my last guardian spirit dwells. In him I place great confidence. Do  not be afraid, or your limbs will be fear-bound. We shall soon reach  his lodge. Run, run!\"    What had in the meantime passed in the lodge of Iamo? He had remained  in the same condition, his head in the sack, directing his sister  where to place the arrows to procure food, and speaking at long  intervals.    One day the girl saw the eyes of the head brighten as if with  pleasure. At last it spoke.    \"O sister!\" it said, \"in what a pitiful situation you have been the  cause of placing me! Soon, very soon, a band of young men will arrive  and apply to me for aid; but alas! how can I give what I would with so  much pleasure have afforded them? Nevertheless, take two arrows, and  place them where you have been in the habit of placing the others, and  have meat cooked and prepared before they arrive. When you hear them  coming, and calling on my name, go out and say, 'Alas! it is long ago  since an accident befell him. I was the cause of it.' If they still  come near, ask them in, and set meat before them. Follow my directions  strictly. A bear will come. Go out and meet him, taking my medicine  sack, bow and arrows, and my head. You must then untie the sack, and  spread out before you my paints of all colours, my war eagle-feathers,  my tufts of dried hair, and whatsoever else the sack contains. As the  bear approaches take these articles, one by one, and say to him, 'This  is my dead brother's paint,' and so on with all the articles, throwing  each of them as far from you as you can. The virtue contained in the  things will cause him to totter. Then, to complete his destruction,  you must take my head and cast it as far off as you can, crying aloud,  'See, this is my dead brother's head!' He will then fall senseless.  While this is taking place the young men will have eaten, and you must  call them to your aid. You will, with their assistance, cut the  carcass of the bear into pieces--into small pieces--and scatter them  to the winds, for unless you do this he will again come to life.\"    The sister promised that all should be done as he commanded, and she  had only time to prepare the meal when the voice of the leader of the  band of warriors was heard calling on Iamo for aid. The girl went out  and did as she had been directed. She invited the brothers in and  placed meat before them, and while they were eating the bear was heard  approaching. Untying the medicine sack and taking the head the girl  made all ready for its approach. When it came up she did as her  brother directed, and before she had cast down all the paints the bear  began to totter, but, still advancing, came close to her. Then she  took the head and cast it from her as far as she could, and as it  rolled upon the ground the bear, tottering, fell with a tremendous  noise. The girl cried for help, and the young men rushed out.    Mudjikewis, stepping up, gave a yell, and struck the bear a blow on  the head. This he repeated till he had dashed out its brains. Then the  others, as quickly as possible, cut the monster up into very small  pieces and scattered them in all directions. As they were engaged in  this they were surprised to find that wherever the flesh was thrown  small black bears appeared, such as are seen at the present day,  which, starting up,"]]]
