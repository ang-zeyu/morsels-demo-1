(#14)"],[1,"the end of his life, Richard Wagner undoubtedly wished to set to  music and to put on the stage, _And to what purpose?_ we may reasonably  ask.      3.      And yet this other question can certainly not be circumvented: what  business had he actually with that manly (alas! so unmanly) \"bucolic  simplicity,\" that poor devil and son of nature--Parsifal, whom he  ultimately makes a catholic by such insidious means--what?--was Wagner in  earnest with Parsifal? For, that he was laughed at, I cannot deny, any  more than Gottfried Keller can.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} We should like to believe that \"Parsifal\"  was meant as a piece of idle gaiety, as the closing act and satyric drama,  with which Wagner the tragedian wished to take leave of us, of himself,  and above all _of tragedy_, in a way which befitted him and his dignity,  that is to say, with an extravagant, lofty and most malicious parody of  tragedy itself, of all the past and terrible earnestness and sorrow of  this world, of the most _ridiculous_ form of the unnaturalness of the  ascetic ideal, at last overcome. For Parsifal is the subject _par  excellence_ for a comic opera.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Is Wagner's \"Parsifal\" his secret laugh of  superiority at himself, the triumph of his last and most exalted state of  artistic freedom, of artistic transcendence--is it Wagner able to _laugh_  at himself? Once again we only wish it were so; for what could Parsifal be  if he were _meant seriously_? Is it necessary in his case to say (as I  have heard people say) that \"Parsifal\" is \"the product of the mad hatred  of knowledge, intellect, and sensuality?\" a curse upon the senses and the  mind in one breath and in one fit of hatred? an act of apostasy and a  return to Christianly sick and obscurantist ideals? And finally even a  denial of self, a deletion of self, on the part of an artist who  theretofore had worked with all the power of his will in favour of the  opposite cause, the spiritualisation and sensualisation of his art? And  not only of his art, but also of his life? Let us remember how  enthusiastically Wagner at one time walked in the footsteps of the  philosopher Feuerbach. Feuerbach's words \"healthy sensuality\" struck  Wagner in the thirties and forties very much as they struck many other  Germans--they called themselves the young Germans--that is to say, as words  of salvation. Did he ultimately _change his mind_ on this point? It would  seem that he had at least had the desire of _changing_ his doctrine  towards the end.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Had the _hatred of life_ become dominant in him as in  Flaubert? For \"Parsifal\" is a work of rancour, of revenge, of the most  secret concoction of poisons with which to make an end of the first  conditions of life, _it is a bad work_. The preaching of chastity remains  an incitement to unnaturalness: I despise anybody who does not regard  \"Parsifal\" as an outrage upon morality.--        How I Got Rid Of Wagner.      1.      Already in the summer of 1876, when the first festival at Bayreuth was at  its height, I took leave of Wagner in my soul. I cannot endure anything  double-faced. Since Wagner had returned to Germany, he had condescended  step by step to everything that I despise--even to anti-Semitism.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} As a  matter of fact, it was then high time to bid him farewell: but the proof  of this came only too soon. Richard Wagner, ostensibly the most triumphant  creature alive; as a matter of fact, though, a cranky and desperate  _decadent_, suddenly fell helpless and broken on his knees before the  Christian cross.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Was there no German at that time who had the eyes to  see, and the sympathy in his soul to feel, the ghastly nature of this  spectacle? Was I the only one who _suffered_ from it?--Enough, the  unexpected event, like a flash of lightning, made me see only too clearly  what kind of a place it was that I had just left,--and it also made me  shudder as a man shudders who unawares has just escaped a great danger. As  I continued my journey alone, I trembled. Not long after this I was ill,  more than ill--I was _tired_;--tired of the continual disappointments over  everything which remained for us modern men to be enthusiastic about, of  the energy, industry, hope, youth, and love that are _squandered  everywhere_; tired out of loathing for the whole world of idealistic lying  and conscience-softening, which, once again, in the case of Wagner, had  scored a victory over a man who was of the bravest; and last but not  least, tired by the sadness of a ruthless suspicion--that I was now  condemned to be ever more and more suspicious, ever more and more  contemptuous, ever more and more _deeply_ alone than I had been  theretofore. For I had no one save Richard Wagner.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} I was always condemned  to the society of Germans.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}      2.      Henceforward alone and cruelly distrustful of myself, I then took up  sides--not without anger--_against myself_ and _for_ all that which hurt me  and fell hard upon me; and thus I found the road to that courageous  pessimism which is the opposite of all idealistic falsehood, and which, as  it seems to me, is also the road to _me_--_to my mission_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} That hidden and  dominating thing, for which for long ages we have had no name, until  ultimately it comes forth as our mission,--this tyrant in us wreaks a  terrible revenge upon us for every attempt we make either to evade him or  to escape him, for every one of our experiments in the way of befriending  people to whom we do not belong, for every active occupation, however  estimable, which may make us diverge from our principal object:--aye, and  even for every virtue which would fain protect us from the rigour of our  most intimate sense of responsibility. Illness is always the answer,  whenever we venture to doubt our right to _our_ mission, whenever we begin  to make things too easy for ourselves. Curious and terrible at the same  time! It is for our relaxation that we have to pay most dearly! And should  we wish after all to return to health, we then have no choice: we are  compelled to burden ourselves _more_ heavily than we had been burdened  before.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}        The Psychologist Speaks.      1.      The oftener a psychologist--a born, an unavoidable psychologist and  soul-diviner--turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals,  the greater becomes his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he needs  greater hardness and cheerfulness than any other man. For the corruption,  the ruination of higher men, is in fact the rule: it is terrible to have  such a rule always before our eyes. The manifold torments of the  psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and  then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this universal  inner \"hopelessness\" of higher men, this eternal \"too late!\" in every  sense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his \"going to the dogs\" himself.  In almost every psychologist we may see a tell-tale predilection in favour  of intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men: and this betrays how  constantly he requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and  forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness--from what his  \"business\"--has laid upon his conscience. A horror of his memory is typical  of him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others, he hears with  unmoved countenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where he  has opened his eyes and _seen_--or he even conceals his silence by  expressly agreeing with some obvious opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his  situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt _great  sympathy_, together with _great contempt_, the educated have on their part  learnt great reverence. And who knows but in all great instances, just  this alone happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the  \"God\" was only a poor sacrificial animal! _Success_ has always been the  greatest liar--and the \"work\" itself, the _deed_, is a success too; the  great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their  creations until they can no longer be recognised, the \"work\" of the  artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, who is  reputed to have created it, the \"great men,\" as they are reverenced, are  poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical  values counterfeit coinage _prevails_.      2.      Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi,  Kleist, Gogol (I do not dare to mention much greater names, but I imply  them), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the  moment, sensuous, absurd, versatile, light-minded and quick to trust and  to distrust, with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed,  often taking revenge with their works for an internal blemish, often  seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too accurate memory,  idealists out of proximity to the mud:--what a _torment_ these great  artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once  found them out! We are all special pleaders in the cause of mediocrity. It  is conceivable that it is just from woman--who is clairvoyant in the world  of suffering, and, alas! also unfortunately eager to help and save to an  extent far beyond her powers--that _they_ have learnt so readily those  outbreaks of boundless _sympathy_ which the multitude, above all the  reverent multitude, overwhelms with prying and self-gratifying  interpretations. This sympathising invariably deceives itself as to its  power; woman would like to believe that love can do _everything_--it is the  _superstition_ peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how  poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love  is--how much more readily it _destroys_ than"]]]
