Louis XII., who permitted free comment on public affairs from actors  on the stage, himself employed the poet Pierre Gringoire to satirise  his adversary the Pope. In 1512 the _Jeu du Prince des Sots_ was given  in Paris; Gringoire, the _Mere-Sotte_, but wearing the Papal robes  to conceal for a time the garb of folly, discharged a principal part.  Such dangerous pleasantries as this were vigorously restrained by  Francois I.    A dramatic monologue or a _sermon joyeux_ was commonly interposed  between the _sottie_ and the Morality or miracle which followed. The  sermon parodied in verse the pulpit discourses of the time, with text  duly announced, the customary scholastic divisions, and an  incredible licence in matter and in phrase. Among the dramatic  monologues of the fifteenth century is found at least one little  masterpiece, which has been ascribed on insufficient grounds to  Villon, and which would do no discredit to that poet's genius--the  _Franc-Archer de Bagnolet_. The francs-archers of Charles VII.--a  rural militia--were not beloved of the people; the _miles gloriosus_  of Bagnolet village, boasting largely of his valour, encounters a  stuffed scarecrow, twisting to the wind; his alarms, humiliations,  and final triumph are rendered in a monologue which expounds the  action of the piece with admirable spirit.    If the Mystery served to fill the void left by the national epopee,  the farce may be regarded as to some extent the dramatic inheritor  of the spirit of the fabliau. It aims at mirth and laughter for their  own sakes, without any purpose of edification; it had, like the  fabliau, the merit of brevity, and not infrequently the fault of  unabashed grossness. But the very fact that it was a thing of little  consequence allowed the farce to exhibit at times an audacity of  political or ecclesiastical criticism which transformed it into a  dramatised pamphlet. In general it chose its matter from the ludicrous  misadventures of private life: the priest, the monk, the husband,  the mother-in-law, the wife, the lover, the roguish servant are the  agents in broadly ludicrous intrigues; the young wife lords it over  her dotard husband, and makes mockery of his presumptive heirs, in  _La Cornette_ of Jean d'Abondance; in _Le Cuvier_, the husband, whose  many household duties have been scheduled, has his revenge--the list,  which he deliberately recites while his wife flounders helpless in  the great washing-tub, does not include the task of effecting her  deliverance.    Amid much that is trivial and much that is indecent, one farce stands  out pre-eminent, and may indeed be called a comedy of manners and  of character--the merry misfortunes of that learned advocate,  _Maitre Pierre Pathelin_. The date is doubtless about 1470; the author,  probably a Parisian and a member of the Basoche, is unknown. With  all his toiling and cheating, Pathelin is poor; with infinite art  and spirit he beguiles the draper of the cloth which will make himself  a coat and his faithful Guillemette a gown; when the draper, losing  no time, comes for his money and an added dinner of roast goose, behold  Maitre Pathelin is in a raging fever, raving in every dialect. Was  the purchase of his cloth a dream, or work of the devil? To add to  the worthy tradesman's ill-luck, his shepherd has stolen his wool  and eaten his sheep. The dying Pathelin unexpectedly appears in court  to defend the accused, and having previously advised his client to  affect idiocy and reply to all questions with the senseless utterance  _bee_, he triumphantly wins the case; but the tables are turned when  Master Pathelin demands his fee, and can obtain no other response  than _bee_ from the instructed shepherd. The triumph of rogue over  rogue is the only moral of the piece; it is a satire on fair dealing  and justice, and, though the morals of a farce are not to be gravely  insisted on, such morals as _Maitre Pathelin_ presents agree well  with the spirit of the age which first enjoyed this masterpiece of  caricature.    The actors in mediaeval comedy, as in the serious drama, were amateurs.  The members of the academic _puys_ were succeeded by the members of  guilds, or _confreries_, or _societes joyeuses_. Of these societies  the most celebrated was that of the Parisian _Enfants sans Souci_.  With this were closely associated the Basochiens, the corporation  of clerks to the _procureurs_ of the Parlement of Paris.[3] It may  be that the _sots_ of the capital were only members of the _basoche_,  assuming for the occasion the motley garb. In colleges, scholars  performed at first in Latin plays, but from the fifteenth century  in French. At the same time, troupes of performers occasionally moved  from city to city, exhibiting a Mystery, but they did not hold together  when the occasion had passed. Professional comedians were brought  from Italy to Lyons in 1548, for the entertainment of Henri II. and  Catherine de Medicis. From that date companies of French actors appear  to become numerous. New species of the drama--tragedy, comedy,  pastoral--replace the mediaeval forms; but much of the genius of  French classical comedy is a development from the Morality, the  _sottie_, and the farce. To present these newer forms the service  of trained actors was required. During the last quarter of the  sixteenth century the amateur performers of the ancient drama finally  disappear.    [Footnote 3: This corporation, known as the _Royaume de la Basoche_  (_basilica_), was probably as old as the fourteenth century.]          BOOK THE SECOND  _THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY_          CHAPTER I  RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION      The literature of the sixteenth century is dominated by two chief  influences--that of the Renaissance and that of the Reformation. When  French armies under Charles VIII. and Louis XII. made a descent on  Italy, they found everywhere a recognition of the importance of art,  an enthusiasm for beauty, a feeling for the aesthetic as well as the  scholarly aspects of antiquity, a new joy in life, an universal  curiosity, a new confidence in human reason. To Latin culture a Greek  culture had been added; and side by side with the mediaeval master  of the understanding, Aristotle, the master of the imaginative reason,  Plato, was held in honour. Before the first quarter of the sixteenth  century closed, France had received a great gift from Italy, which  profoundly modified, but by no means effaced, the characteristics  of her national genius. The Reformation was a recovery of Christian  antiquity and of Hebraism, and for a time the religious movement made  common cause with the Renaissance; but the grave morals, the  opposition of grace to nature, and the dogmatic spirit of theology  after a time alienated the Reforming party from the mere humanism  of literature and art. An interest in general ideas and a capacity  for dealing with them were fostered by the study of antiquity both  classical and Christian, by the meeting of various tendencies, and  by the conflict of rival creeds. To embody general ideas in art under  a presiding feeling for beauty, to harmonise thought and form, was  the great work of the seventeenth century; but before this could be  effected it was necessary that France should enjoy tranquillity after  the strife of the civil wars.    Learning had received the distinction of court patronage when Louis  XII. appointed the great scholar Bude his secretary. Around Francis  I., although he was himself rather a lover of the splendour and  ornament of the Renaissance than of its finer spirit, men of learning  and poets gathered. On the suggestion of GUILLAUME BUDE he endowed  professorships of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, to which were added those  of medicine, mathematics, and philosophy (1530-40), and in this  projected foundation of the College de France an important step was  made towards the secularisation of learned studies. The King's sister,  MARGUERITE OF NAVARRE (1492-1549), perhaps the most accomplished  woman of her time, represents more admirably than Francis the genius  of the age. She studied Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, Hebrew, and,  when forty, occupied herself with Greek. Her heart was ardent as well  as her intellect; she was gay and mundane, and at the same time she  was serious (with even a strain of mystical emotion) in her concern  for religion. Although not in communion with the Reformers, she  sympathised with them, and extended a generous protection to those  who incurred danger through their liberal opinions. Her poems,  _Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses_ (1547), show the  mediaeval influences forming a junction with those of the Renaissance.  Some are religious, but side by side with her four dramatic Mysteries  and her eloquent _Triomphe de l'Agneau_ appears the _Histoire des  Satyres et Nymphes de Diane_, imitated from the Italian of Sannazaro.  Among her latest poems, which remained in manuscript until 1896, are  a pastoral dramatic piece expressing her grief for the death of her  brother Francis I.; a second dramatic poem, _Comedie jouee au Mont  de Marsan_, in which love (human or divine) triumphs over the spirit  of the world, over superstitious asceticism, and over the wiser temper  of religious moderation. _Les Prisons_ tells in allegory of her  servitude to passion, to worldly ambition, and to the desire for human  knowledge, until at last the divine love brought her deliverance.  The union of the mundane and the moral spirit is singularly shown  in Marguerite's collection of prose tales, written in imitation of  Boccaccio, the _Heptameron des Nouvelles_ (1558).    These tales were not an indiscretion of youth; probably Marguerite  composed them a few years before her death; perhaps their licence  and wanton mirth were meant to enliven the melancholy hours of her  beloved brother; certainly the writer is ingenious in extracting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24708"],[0,"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction (#14)"],[1,"estine, moistening  and lubricating its contents and causing it to move gradually towards  the rectum, where it stimulates a normal free passage of the bowels  after breakfast.    Any usual case of constipation will yield to this treatment. Such a  treatment is incomparably more rational than the taking of medicines.    d. =The Dietetic Control of Sleep.=--Most students study evenings. If  their heavy meal is a dinner at 5:30 or 6 p.m. they are likely to feel  very drowsy by 7:30 or 8 o'clock. This is a perfectly natural  experience, all animals manifesting a drowsiness after a heavy meal.  If one could lie down and sleep for an hour while his dinner is  digesting, he could probably rise at 9 o'clock and put in two or three  hours of good hard work. He would find himself at 11 or 12 o'clock so  thoroughly awake, however, that he might have difficulty in getting to  sleep if he retired at that hour. If, on the other hand, one has his  dinner in the middle of the day and a light supper at night, he is  able to begin studying within an hour after supper and keep it up  until he is ready to retire. In this case also, he is likely to be so  wide awake at the time of retiring that he may have difficulty in  getting to sleep. In either of these cases, it is altogether proper  and advisable to take a light lunch before retiring. A double purpose  can be served by this lunch. In the first place, the taking of  anything into the stomach that requires digestion tends to deplete the  circulation from other organs (brain in this case) to the stomach. In  the second place, the food may be so chosen as to exert a definite  _somnolent_ effect. Such foods are, _celery_, _lettuce_, _onions_,  _warm milk_. It may not be convenient to get warm milk at midnight,  but it would hardly be inconvenient to provide one's self with two or  three graham crackers and a stalk of celery. These with a drink of  water and a little brisk exercise before an open window ought so far  to divert the circulation from the brain as to enable one to fall  asleep quickly.    e. =The Dietetic Control of the Kidneys and Skin.=--The stimulation of  excretion through the kidneys and skin may be an exceedingly important  thing, particularly if one has just caught a cold and wishes to  establish free excretion. The food which has a most clearly marked  effect upon both kidneys and skin is the juice of the citrus fruits.  These fruits, as they appear in our markets, are _lemons_, _oranges_  and _grape fruit_. All of these fruits are in a high degree wholesome  as an addition to the dietary. Lemon juice is far more wholesome than  vinegar in salads. The juices of lemons and oranges make most  refreshing and deliciously cooling drinks in summer, and on occasions  where one wishes _to get a strong stimulation of the kidneys and skin,  he has only to drink large quantities of hot lemonade_.    f. =The Dietetic Method of Curing a Cold.=--A whole _quart of hot  lemonade_ may be taken on retiring after one has caught cold. The  effect in such a case would be to cause a free sweating and copious  urination. Both the action of the kidneys and the skin would tend to  carry away from the system the effete materials that have been  retained as a result of the cold.    It is hardly necessary to add in this connection that care should be  taken that during the sweating or immediately following it, the _body  should not be exposed to catch more cold_. In this method of treating  a cold, one should _take a strong cathartic_ such as two or three  teaspoonfuls of castor oil, and should remain in bed twenty-four  hours. During this twenty-four hours _no other food than a little  light broth should be taken_. This treatment usually completely breaks  up a cold and one is able, in two or three days, to make good the loss  of the twenty-four hours, during which time he was confined to his  room.    This dietetic method of caring for an acute catarrhal cold is  incomparably wiser and more economical than to drag around, hoping to  \"wear out the cold,\" only to be worn out by it.      2. BATHS.    a. =The Bath for Cleanliness.=--Little need be said regarding the bath  for cleanliness except that it should be taken at least once in a week  during the colder portion of the year and perhaps as frequently as  once a day during that portion of the year when there is free  perspiration.    Where one is bathing for cleanliness he may well use soap and warm  water over the whole surface of the body. If he takes this bath just  before retiring, it is not necessary to take a cold shower or sponge  at the end of the bath. If, however, one takes a warm soap bath in the  morning the relaxing effect of the bath upon the skin makes it  necessary to take a cold shower or a cold sponge after the warm bath  in order to secure the tonic effect upon the skin and fortify one  against catching cold.    During the hot weather when one may bathe daily for cleanliness he  should guard against an excessive use of soap, as a daily soap bath  may have a tendency to remove the oils from the skin so completely as  to make the skin rough. With the daily bath for cleanliness it is  possible that warm water and soap need not be used more frequently  than once or twice a week and that a laving of the whole surface with  cold water followed by a vigorous rub down with a coarse towel may  serve the double purpose of insuring absolute cleanliness, and at the  same time serving as a skin tonic.    In this connection the author would emphasize the importance of  insuring absolute cleanliness of the sexual apparatus. In primeval  conditions less attention was necessary as these organs were more or  less exposed, but the present method of dress is such as to permit the  accumulation of the skin secretions. While these may in part be  removed by the friction against the clothing, it is advisable to wash  the external genitals and all neighboring surfaces as a regular part  of the daily toilet.    b. =The Tonic Bath.=--In warm weather when one takes a daily bath to  insure cleanliness, at least five of these baths each week may be in  cold water, sufficiently cold to secure the tonic effect as described  above. In cold weather, when one takes not more than one or two warm  soap baths a week, the cold tonic bath can be made to serve a most  important purpose in the hygiene.    Some have followed the custom of immersing the body completely in a  tub of cold water. This method of taking the cold bath is not to be  recommended except for those who are in the most robust health, and in  these cases, so vigorous a treatment is not necessary nor particularly  beneficial. The author has seen many people who were injured by this  method of taking the tonic bath.    There are two methods to be recommended: Those who have access to a  cold shower may stand for a moment, and for a moment only, under the  cold shower, then step at once upon a warm rug and rub the whole  surface of the body vigorously with a dry crash towel until the whole  surface of the body glows with the warmth of the reaction. If one does  not have access to the cold shower, he may take a most effective  tonic bath in his room, using cold water, the coldest obtainable, and  a bath sponge, or even a wash cloth, dipping the sponge into the cold  water, then pressing out enough of the water so that there will be no  excess of water to run over the surface of the body from the sponge.  Begin by sponging face, neck, shoulders, arms and chest, then wipe  these parts dry, subject them to vigorous friction with the crash  towel until the arms, shoulders and chest particularly glow with the  warmth of the reaction. While the upper half of the body is receiving  its bath the lower half may be kept covered, and conversely.    This tonic bath should be taken immediately upon arising in the  morning, and as a part of the morning toilet.    If one takes such a tonic bath on arising, then dresses hurriedly and  takes a brisk walk of fifteen or thirty minutes, the regime quickly  brings his body into the most vigorous and robust state of health;  unless there is something wrong with his digestion or his excretion,  and even moderate derangements of these will be very likely to be  corrected by the regime just suggested.      3. EXERCISE.    Incident to the above topic mention has been made of the brisk morning  walk before breakfast. This has a most salutary tonic effect besides  the influence that it exerts upon the bowel movements. Not the least  important result of this morning exercise depends on the fact that the  lungs are repeatedly and completely inflated with the pure out-of-door  air. This naturally exerts a most valuable influence upon the  development of the lungs in the youth or the maintenance of their  vigor in middle age.    The increased heart action is also advantageous as it leads to  hastened circulation through the muscles, glands and brain. This  hurrying blood current not only carries nutriment to these organs, but  carries away their accumulations of effete material to the excretory  glands.    The student must be cautioned not to overdo this early morning  exercise. The mile run, the mile row or any other strenuous exercise  is strongly to be discouraged at this time of the day. If one overdoes  morning exercise, he is likely to feel somewhat depleted and fatigued,  throughout the remainder of the forenoon, and his ability to do a high  grade of mental work is decreased rather than increased.    Besides the morning exercise, every person who wishes to live a  vigorous physical life should have from one to two hours of heavier  exercise during the latter part of the day or evening. This exercise  may take any one of many forms. It may be golf, tennis, foot-ball,  base-ball, cricket, rowing, lacrosse, basket-ball, cross country  running, track or gymnasium work, etc., etc. The immediate results of  this exercise should be largely to increase lung and heart"]]]
