The \"bull of heaven\" probably refers to some legend such as that of  the story of Gilgames in his conflict with the goddess Istar when the  divine bull was killed; /Sib-zi-anna/, \"the faithful shepherd of  heaven,\" suggests that this constellation may refer to Tammuz, the  divine shepherd; whilst \"the scorpion\" reminds us of the scorpion-men  who guarded the gate of the sun (Samas), when Gilgames was journeying  to gain information concerning his friend Enki-du, who had departed to  the place of the dead. Sir Henry Rawlinson many years ago pointed out  that the story of the Flood occupied the eleventh tablet of the  Gilgames series, corresponding with the eleventh sign of the Zodiac,  Aquarius, or the Water-bearer.                                Other star-names.    Other names of stars or constellations include \"the weapon of  Merodach's hand,\" probably that with which he slew the dragon of  Chaos; \"the Horse,\" which is described as \"the god Zu,\" Rimmon's  storm-bird--Pegasus; \"the Serpent,\" explained as Eres-ki-gal, the  queen of Hades, who would therefore seem to have been conceived in  that form; \"the Scorpion,\" which is given as /Ishara tantim/, \"Ishara  of the sea,\" a description difficult to explain, unless it refer to  her as the goddess of the Phoenician coast. Many other identifications,  exceedingly interesting, await solution.                How the gods were represented. On cylinder-seals.    Many representations of the gods occur, both on bas-reliefs,  boundary-stones, and cylindrical and ordinary seals. Unfortunately, their  identification generally presents more or less difficulty, on account  of the absence of indications of their identity. On a small cylinder-seal  in the possession of the Rev. Dr. W. Hayes Ward, Merodach is  shown striding along the serpentine body of Tiawath, who turns her  head to attack him, whilst the god threatens her with a pointed weapon  which he carries. Another, published by the same scholar, shows a  deity, whom he regards as being Merodach, driven in a chariot drawn by  a winged lion, upon whose shoulders stands a naked goddess, holding  thunderbolts in each hand, whom he describes as Zer-panitum. Another  cylinder-seal shows the corn-deity, probably Nisaba, seated in  flounced robe and horned hat, with corn-stalks springing out from his  shoulders, and holding a twofold ear of corn in his hand, whilst an  attendant introduces, and another with a threefold ear of corn  follows, a man carrying a plough, apparently as an offering. On  another, a beautiful specimen from Assyria, Istar is shown standing on  an Assyrian lion, which turns his head as if to caress her feet. As  goddess of war, she is armed with bow and arrows, and her star is  represented upon the crown of her tiara.                             On boundary-stones, etc.    On the boundary-stones of Babylonia and the royal monoliths of Assyria  the emblems of the gods are nearly always seen. Most prominent are  three horned tiaras, emblematic, probably, of Merodach, Anu, and Bel  (the older). A column ending in a ram's head is used for Ea or Ae, a  crescent for Sin or Nannar, the moon-god; a disc with rays for Samas,  the sun-god; a thunderbolt for Rimmon or Hadad, the god of thunder,  lightning, wind, and storms; a lamp for Nusku, etc. A bird, perhaps a  hawk, stood for Utu-gisgallu, a deity whose name has been translated  \"the southern sun,\" and is explained in the bilingual inscriptions as  Samas, the sun-god, and Nirig, one of the gods of war. The emblem of  Gal-alim, who is identified with the older Bel, is a snarling dragon's  head forming the termination of a pole, and that of Dun-asaga is a  bird's head similarly posed. On a boundary-stone of the time of  Nebuchadnezzar I., about 1120 B.C., one of the signs of the gods shows  a horse's head in a kind of shrine, probably the emblem of Rimmon's  storm-bird, Zu, the Babylonian Pegasus.                              Other divine figures.    One of the finest of all the representations of divinities is that of  the \"Sun-god-stone,\" found by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam at Abu-habbah (the  ancient Sippar), which was one of the chief seats of his worship. It  represents him, seated in his shrine, holding in his hand a staff and  a ring, his usual emblems, typifying his position as judge of the  world and his endless course. The position of Merodach as sun-god is  confirmed by the small lapis-lazuli relief found by the German  expedition at the mound known as Amran ibn 'Ali, as he also carries a  staff and a ring, and his robe is covered with ornamental circles,  showing, in all probability, his solar nature. In the same place  another small relief representing Rimmon or Hadad was found. His robe  has discs emblematical of the five planets, and he holds in each hand  a thunderbolt, one of which he is about to launch forth. Merodach is  accompanied by a large two-horned dragon, whilst Hadad has a small  winged dragon, typifying the swiftness of his course, and another  animal, both of which he holds with cords.                                      CHAPTER V                     THE DEMONS: EXORCISMS AND CEREMONIES    Good and evil spirits, gods and demons, were fully believed in by the  Babylonians and Assyrians, and many texts referring to them exist.  Naturally it is not in some cases easy to distinguish well between the  special functions of these supernatural appearances which they  supposed to exist, but their nature is, in most cases, easily  ascertained from the inscriptions.    To all appearance, the Babylonians imagined that spirits resided  everywhere, and lay in wait to attack mankind, and to each class,  apparently, a special province in bringing misfortune, or tormenting,  or causing pain and sickness, was assigned. All the spirits, however,  were not evil, even those whose names would suggest that their  character was such--there were good \"liers in wait,\" for instance, as  well as evil ones, whose attitude towards mankind was beneficent.    The /utukku/. This was a spirit which was supposed to do the will of  Anu, the god of the heavens. There was the /utukku/ of the plain, the  mountains, the sea, and the grave.    The /alu/. Regarded as the demon of the storm, and possibly, in its  origin, the same as the divine bull sent by Istar to attack Gilgames,  and killed by Enki-du. It spread itself over a man, overpowering him  upon his bed, and attacking his breast.    The /edimmu/. This is generally, but wrongly, read /ekimmu/, and  translated \"the seizer,\" from /ekemu/, \"to seize.\" In reality,  however, it was an ordinary spirit, and the word is used for the  wraiths of the departed. The \"evil /edimmu/\" was apparently regarded  as attacking the middle part of a man.    The /gallu/. As this word is borrowed from the Sumerian /galla/, which  has a dialectic form, /mulla/, it is not improbable that it may be  connected with the word /mula/, meaning \"star,\" and suggesting  something which is visible by the light it gives--possibly a  will-o'-the-wisp,--though others are inclined to regard the word as being  connected with /gala/, \"great.\" In any case, its meaning seems to have  become very similar to \"evil spirit\" or \"devil\" in general, and is an  epithet applied by the Assyrian king Assur-bani-apli to Te-umman, the  Elamite king against whom he fought.    The /ilu limnu/, \"evil god,\" was probably originally one of the  deities of Tiawath's brood, upon whom Merodach's redemption had had no  effect.    The /rabisu/ is regarded as a spirit which lay in wait to pounce upon  his prey.    The /labartu/, in Sumerian /dimme/, was a female demon. There were  seven evil spirits of this kind, who were apparently regarded as being  daughters of Anu, the god of the heavens.    The /labasu/, in Sumerian /dimmea/, was apparently a spirit which  overthrew, that being the meaning of the root from which the word  comes.    The /ahhazu/, in Sumerian /dimme-kur/, was apparently so called as  \"the seizer,\" that being the meaning indicated by the root.    The /lilu/, in Sumerian /lila/, is generally regarded as \"the  night-monster,\" the word being referred to the Semitic root /lil/ or  /layl/, whence the Hebrew /layil/, Arabic /layl/, \"night.\" Its origin,  however, is Sumerian, from /lila/, regarded as meaning \"mist.\" To the  word /lilu/ the ancient Babylonians formed a feminine, /lilithu/,  which entered the Hebrew language under the form of /lilith/, which  was, according to the rabbins, a beautiful woman, who lay in wait for  children by night. The /lilu/ had a companion who is called his  handmaid or servant.    The /namtaru/ was apparently the spirit of fate, and therefore of  greater importance than those already mentioned. This being was  regarded as the beloved son of Bel, and offspring of /Eres-ki-gal/ or  Persephone, and he had a spouse named /Hus-bi-saga/. Apparently he  executed the instructions given him concerning the fate of men, and  could also have power over certain of the gods.    The /sedu/ were apparently deities in the form of bulls. They were  destructive, of enormous power, and unsparing. In a good sense the  /sedu/ was a protecting deity, guarding against hostile attacks. Erech  and the temple E-kura were protected by spirits such as these, and to  one of them Isum, \"the glorious sacrificer,\" was likened.    The /lamassu/, from the Sumerian /lama/, was similar in character to  the /sedu/, but is thought to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],[0,"To the Last Man (#14)"],[1,"filled her--disgust that she had been amiable to a member of  the hated family that had ruined her father.  The surprise of this  meeting did not come to her while she was under the spell of stronger  feeling.  She walked under the trees, swiftly, with head erect, looking  straight before her, and every step seemed a relief.    Upon reaching camp, her attention was distracted from herself.  Pepe,  the Mexican boy, with the two shepherd dogs, was trying to drive sheep  into a closer bunch to save the lambs from coyotes.  Ellen loved the  fleecy, tottering little lambs, and at this season she hated all the  prowling beast of the forest.  From this time on for weeks the flock  would be besieged by wolves, lions, bears, the last of which were often  bold and dangerous.  The old grizzlies that killed the ewes to eat only  the milk-bags were particularly dreaded by Ellen.  She was a good shot  with a rifle, but had orders from her father to let the bears alone.  Fortunately, such sheep-killing bears were but few, and were left to be  hunted by men from the ranch.  Mexican sheep herders could not be  depended upon to protect their flocks from bears. Ellen helped Pepe  drive in the stragglers, and she took several shots at coyotes skulking  along the edge of the brush.  The open glade in the forest was  favorable for herding the sheep at night, and the dogs could be  depended upon to guard the flock, and in most cases to drive predatory  beasts away.    After this task, which brought the time to sunset, Ellen had supper to  cook and eat.  Darkness came, and a cool night wind set in. Here and  there a lamb bleated plaintively.  With her work done for the day,  Ellen sat before a ruddy camp fire, and found her thoughts again  centering around the singular adventure that had befallen her.  Disdainfully she strove to think of something else.  But there was  nothing that could dispel the interest of her meeting with Jean Isbel.  Thereupon she impatiently surrendered to it, and recalled every word  and action which she could remember.  And in the process of this  meditation she came to an action of hers, recollection of which brought  the blood tingling to her neck and cheeks, so unusually and burningly  that she covered them with her hands.  \"What did he think of me?\" she  mused, doubtfully.  It did not matter what he thought, but she could  not help wondering.  And when she came to the memory of his kiss she  suffered more than the sensation of throbbing scarlet cheeks.  Scornfully and bitterly she burst out, \"Shore he couldn't have thought  much good of me.\"    The half hour following this reminiscence was far from being pleasant.  Proud, passionate, strong-willed Ellen Jorth found herself a victim of  conflicting emotions.  The event of the day was too close.  She could  not understand it.  Disgust and disdain and scorn could not make this  meeting with Jean Isbel as if it had never been.  Pride could not  efface it from her mind.  The more she reflected, the harder she tried  to forget, the stronger grew a significance of interest.  And when a  hint of this dawned upon her consciousness she resented it so forcibly  that she lost her temper, scattered the camp fire, and went into the  little teepee tent to roll in her blankets.    Thus settled snug and warm for the night, with a shepherd dog curled at  the opening of her tent, she shut her eyes and confidently bade sleep  end her perplexities.  But sleep did not come at her invitation. She  found herself wide awake, keenly sensitive to the sputtering of the  camp fire, the tinkling of bells on the rams, the bleating of lambs,  the sough of wind in the pines, and the hungry sharp bark of coyotes  off in the distance.  Darkness was no respecter of her pride.  The  lonesome night with its emphasis of solitude seemed to induce clamoring  and strange thoughts, a confusing ensemble of all those that had  annoyed her during the daytime.  Not for long hours did sheer weariness  bring her to slumber.    Ellen awakened late and failed of her usual alacrity.  Both Pepe and  the shepherd dog appeared to regard her with surprise and solicitude.  Ellen's spirit was low this morning; her blood ran sluggishly; she had  to fight a mournful tendency to feel sorry for herself.  And at first  she was not very successful.  There seemed to be some kind of pleasure  in reveling in melancholy which her common sense told her had no reason  for existence.  But states of mind persisted in spite of common sense.    \"Pepe, when is Antonio comin' back?\" she asked.    The boy could not give her a satisfactory answer.  Ellen had willingly  taken the sheep herder's place for a few days, but now she was  impatient to go home.  She looked down the green-and-brown aisles of  the forest until she was tired.  Antonio did not return.  Ellen spent  the day with the sheep; and in the manifold task of caring for a  thousand new-born lambs she forgot herself.  This day saw the end of  lambing-time for that season.  The forest resounded to a babel of baas  and bleats.  When night came she was glad to go to bed, for what with  loss of sleep, and weariness she could scarcely keep her eyes open.    The following morning she awakened early, bright, eager, expectant,  full of bounding life, strangely aware of the beauty and sweetness of  the scented forest, strangely conscious of some nameless stimulus to  her feelings.    Not long was Ellen in associating this new and delightful variety of  sensations with the fact that Jean Isbel had set to-day for his ride up  to the Rim to see her.  Ellen's joyousness fled; her smiles faded. The  spring morning lost its magic radiance.    \"Shore there's no sense in my lyin' to myself,\" she soliloquized,  thoughtfully.  \"It's queer of me--feelin' glad aboot him--without  knowin'.  Lord!  I must be lonesome!  To be glad of seein' an Isbel,  even if he is different!\"    Soberly she accepted the astounding reality.  Her confidence died with  her gayety; her vanity began to suffer.  And she caught at her  admission that Jean Isbel was different; she resented it in amaze; she  ridiculed it; she laughed at her naive confession.  She could arrive at  no conclusion other than that she was a weak-minded, fluctuating,  inexplicable little fool.    But for all that she found her mind had been made up for her, without  consent or desire, before her will had been consulted; and that  inevitably and unalterably she meant to see Jean Isbel again. Long she  battled with this strange decree.  One moment she won a victory over,  this new curious self, only to lose it the next. And at last out of her  conflict there emerged a few convictions that left her with some shreds  of pride.  She hated all Isbels, she hated any Isbel, and particularly  she hated Jean Isbel.  She was only curious--intensely curious to see  if he would come back, and if he did come what he would do.  She wanted  only to watch him from some covert.  She would not go near him, not let  him see her or guess of her presence.    Thus she assuaged her hurt vanity--thus she stifled her miserable  doubts.    Long before the sun had begun to slant westward toward the  mid-afternoon Jean Isbel had set as a meeting time Ellen directed her  steps through the forest to the Rim.  She felt ashamed of her  eagerness.  She had a guilty conscience that no strange thrills could  silence.  It would be fun to see him, to watch him, to let him wait for  her, to fool him.    Like an Indian, she chose the soft pine-needle mats to tread upon, and  her light-moccasined feet left no trace.  Like an Indian also she made  a wide detour, and reached the Rim a quarter of a mile west of the spot  where she had talked with Jean Isbel; and here, turning east, she took  care to step on the bare stones.  This was an adventure, seemingly the  first she had ever had in her life.  Assuredly she had never before  come directly to the Rim without halting to look, to wonder, to  worship. This time she scarcely glanced into the blue abyss.  All  absorbed was she in hiding her tracks.  Not one chance in a thousand  would she risk. The Jorth pride burned even while the feminine side of  her dominated her actions.  She had some difficult rocky points to  cross, then windfalls to round, and at length reached the covert she  desired. A rugged yellow point of the Rim stood somewhat higher than  the spot Ellen wanted to watch.  A dense thicket of jack pines grew to  the very edge.  It afforded an ambush that even the Indian eyes Jean  Isbel was credited with could never penetrate.  Moreover, if by  accident she made a noise and excited suspicion, she could retreat  unobserved and hide in the huge rocks below the Rim, where a ferret  could not locate her.    With her plan decided upon, Ellen had nothing to do but wait, so she  repaired to the other side  of the pine thicket and to the edge of the  Rim where she could watch and listen.  She knew that long before she  saw Isbel she would hear his horse.  It was altogether unlikely that he  would come on foot.    \"Shore, Ellen Jorth, y'u're a queer girl,\" she mused.  \"I reckon I  wasn't well acquainted with y'u.\"    Beneath her yawned a wonderful deep canyon, rugged and rocky with but  few pines on the north slope, thick with dark green timber on the south  slope.  Yellow and gray crags, like turreted castles, stood up out of  the sloping forest on the side opposite her.  The trees were all sharp,  spear pointed.  Patches of light green aspens showed strikingly against  the dense black.  The great slope beneath Ellen was serrated with  narrow, deep gorges, almost canyons in themselves. Shadows alternated  with clear bright spaces.  The mile-wide mouth of the canyon opened  upon the Basin, down into a world of wild timbered ranges and ravines,  valleys and hills, that rolled and tumbled in dark-green waves to the  Sierra Anchas.    But for once Ellen seemed singularly unresponsive to this panorama of  wildness and grandeur. "]]]
