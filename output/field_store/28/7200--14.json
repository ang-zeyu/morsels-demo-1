On the other hand, they have seen concrete mixed for street  pavement foundation with only three turns before shoveling it into  place. These costs of mixing apply to work done by diligent men; easy  going men will make the cost 25 to 50 per cent greater.    ~LOADING AND HAULING MIXED CONCRETE.~--Wheelbarrows and carts are employed  to haul the mixed concrete to the work. The loading of these with mixed  concrete by shoveling costs less than the loading of the materials  separately before mixing. While the weight is greater because of the  added water the volume of the concrete is much less than that of the  ingredients before mixing. Again the shoveling is done off a smooth  board with the added advantage of having the material lubricated and,  finally, the foreman is usually at this point to crowd the work. A good  worker will load 12½ cu. yds. of concrete per 10-hour day, and with  wages at $1.50 per day this would give a cost of 12 cts. per cu. yd. for  loading.    Practically the same principles govern the transporting of concrete in  barrows as govern the handling of the raw materials in them. The cost of  wheeling concrete is practically the same as for wheeling the dry  ingredients, so that the total cost of loading and wheeling may be  estimated by the following rule:    _To a fixed cost of 16 cts. for loading and lost time add 1 ct. for  every 30 ft. of level haul._    Within a few years wheelbarrows have been supplanted to a considerable  extent by hand carts of the general type shown by Fig. 12, which  illustrates one made by the Ransome Concrete Machinery Co. The bowl of  this cart has a capacity of 6 cu. ft. water measure. It is hung on a  1¼-in. steel axle; the wheels are 42 ins. in diameter with staggered  spokes and 2-in. half oval tires. The top of the bowl is 29½ ins. from  the ground. Owing to the large diameter of the wheels and the fact that  no weight comes on the wheeler, as with a wheelbarrow, this cart is  handled by one man about as rapidly and easily as is a wheelbarrow. It  will be noted that the two ends of the bowl differ in shape; the handle  is removable and can be attached to either end of the bowl. With the  handle attached as shown the bowl can be inverted for discharging onto a  pavement or floor; with the handle transferred to the opposite end the  bowl is fitted for dumping into narrow beam or wall forms. The maximum  load of wet concrete for a wheelbarrow is 2 cu. ft., and this is a heavy  load and one that is seldom averaged--1 to 1½ cu. ft. is more nearly the  general average. A cart of the above type will, therefore, carry from 3  to 5 wheelbarrow loads, and on good runways, which are essential, may be  pushed and dumped about as rapidly as a wheelbarrow. In succeeding pages  are given records of actual work with hand carts which should be studied  in this connection.    Portland cement concrete can be hauled a considerable distance in a dump  cart or wagon before it begins to harden; natural cement sets too  quickly to permit of its being hauled far. Portland cement does not  begin to set in less than 30 minutes. On a good road, with no long,  steep hills a team will haul a loaded wagon at a speed of about 200 ft.  per minute; it, therefore, takes 6½ minutes to travel a quarter of a  mile, 13 minutes to travel half a mile, and 26 minutes to travel a mile.  Portland cement concrete can, therefore, be hauled a mile before it  begins to set. The cost of hauling concrete in carts is about the same  as the cost of hauling the raw materials as given in a preceding  section.    When hand mixing is employed in building piers, abutments, walls, etc.,  the concrete often has to be hoisted as well as wheeled. A gallows frame  or a mast with a pulley block at the top and a team of horses can often  be used in such cases as described in Chapter XII for filling cylinder  piers, or in the same chapter for constructing a bridge abutment. It is  also possible often to locate the mixing board on high ground, perhaps  at some little distance from the forms. If this can be done, the use of  derricks may be avoided as above suggested or by building a light pole  trestle from the mixing board to the forms. The concrete can then be  wheeled in barrows and dumped into the forms. If the mixing board can be  located on ground as high as the top of the concrete structure is to be,  obviously a trestle will enable the men to wheel on a level runway. Such  a trestle can be built very cheaply, especially where second-hand  lumber, or lumber that can be used subsequently for forms is available.  A pole trestle whose bents are made entirely of round sticks cut from  the forest is a very cheap structure, if a foreman knows how to throw it  together and up-end the bents after they are made. One of the authors  has put up such trestles for 25 cts. per lineal foot of trestle,  including all labor of cutting the round timber, erecting it, and  placing a plank flooring 4 ft. wide on top. The stringers and flooring  plank were used later for forms, and their cost is not included. A  trestle 100 ft. long can thus be built at less cost than hauling,  erecting and taking down a derrick; and once the trestle is up it saves  the cost of operating a derrick.    In conclusion, it should be remarked that the comparative economy for  concrete work of the different methods of haulage described, does not  depend wholly on the comparative transportation costs; the effect of the  method of haulage on the cost of dumping and spreading costs must be  considered. For example, if carts deliver the material in such form that  the cost of spreading is greatly increased over what it would be were  the concrete delivered in wheelbarrows, the gain made by cart haulage  may be easily wiped out or even turned into loss by the extra spreading  charges. These matters are considered more at length in the succeeding  section.    ~DUMPING, SPREADING AND RAMMING.~--The cost of dumping wheelbarrows and  carts is included in the rules of cost already given, excepting that in  some cases it is necessary to add the wages of a man at the dump who  assists the cart drivers or the barrow men. Thus in dumping concrete  from barrows into a deep trench or pit, it is usually advisable to dump  into a galvanized iron hopper provided with an iron pipe chute. One man  can readily dump all the barrows that can be filled from a concrete  mixer in a day, say 150 cu. yds. At this rate of output the cost of  dumping would be only 1 ct. per cu. yd., but if one man were required to  dump the output of a small gang of men, say 25 cu. yds., the cost of  dumping would be 6 cts. per cu. yd.    Concrete dumped through a chute requires very little work to spread it  in 6-in. layers; and, in fact, concrete that can be dumped from  wheelbarrows, which do not all dump in one place, can be spread very  cheaply; for not more than half the pile dumped from the barrow needs to  be moved, and then moved merely by pushing with a shovel. Since the  spreader also rams the concrete, it is difficult to separate these two  items. As nearly as the authors have been able to estimate this item of  spreading \"dry\" concrete dumped from wheelbarrows in street paving  work, the cost is 5 cts. per cu. yd. If, on the other hand, nearly all  the concrete must be handled by the spreaders, as in spreading concrete  dumped from carts, the cost is fully double, or 10 cts. per cu. yd. And  if the spreader has to walk even 3 or 4 paces to place the concrete  after shoveling it up, the cost of spreading will be 15 cts. per cu. yd.  For this reason it is apparent that carts are not as economical as  wheelbarrows for hauling concrete up to about 200 ft., due to the added  cost of spreading material delivered by carts.    The preceding discussion of spreading is based upon the assumption that  the concrete is not so wet that it will run. Obviously where concrete is  made of small stones and contains an excess of water, it will run so  readily as to require little or no spreading.    The cost of ramming concrete depends almost entirely upon its dryness  and upon the number of cubic yards delivered to the rammers. Concrete  that is mixed with very little water requires long and hard ramming to  flush the water to the surface. The yardage delivered to the rammers is  another factor, because if only a few men are engaged in mixing they  will not be able to deliver enough concrete to keep the rammers properly  busy, yet the rammers by slow though continuous pounding may be keeping  up an appearance of working. Then, again, it has been noticed that the  slower the concrete is delivered the more particular the average  inspector becomes. Concrete made \"sloppy\" requires no ramming at all,  and very little spading. The authors have had men do very thorough  ramming of moderately dry concrete for 15 cts. per cu. yd., where the  rammers had no spreading to do, the material being delivered in shovels.  It is rare indeed that spreading and ramming can be made to cost more  than 40 cts. per cu. yd., under the most foolish inspection, yet one  instance is recorded which, because of its rarity, is worth noting: Mr.  Herman Conrow is the authority for the data: 1 foreman, 9 men mixing, 1  ramming, averaged 15 cu. yds. a day, or only 1½ cu. yds. per man per  day, when laying wet concrete. When laying dry concrete the same gang  averaged only 8 cu. yds. a day, there being 4 men ramming. With foreman  at $2 and laborers at $1.50 a day, the cost was $2.12 per cu. yd. for  labor on the dry concrete as against $1.13 per cu. yd. for the wet  concrete. Three turnings of the stone with a wet mortar effected a  better mixture than four turnings with a dry mortar.

As he trudged back and forth on his beat he  could catch an occasional glimpse of the Scotchman, who stopped to toss  a few sticks on the fire or halted an instant to exchange a word with  one of the Mexicans. The boy could also see his father's dim figure  walking to and fro. It was dull work, this monotonous tramp. Donald  looked up at the canopy of stars and thought he had never seen so many.  He yawned, and yawned a second time. Still he kept up his even jog along  the outskirts of the fold.    Suddenly he was conscious of a low whine not far away. It was repeated.  Then came a loud barking as if a pack of wolves were on the other side  of the pasture. He heard Sandy's voice echoing on the clear air. Two  shots followed. Perhaps the coyotes were over there; or could it be a  cougar or a bear? How he longed to be in the midst of the sport! Why  should he stay on this quiet, unmolested border of the pasture? Nothing  was happening here! An impulse to join his father or Sandy swept over  him; then a thought rose in his mind and held him back--if he left his  patrol he would be a deserter, a deserter as blameworthy as any sentry  who fled from his post. Straightening up proudly, the boy resumed his  even pace.    It was just as he turned that he caught sight of a crouching form  slipping along the ground toward the edge of the flock. With a sharp  flash Donald's rifle rang out. He shot into the air, not daring to aim  toward the pasture lest unwittingly he injure some of the sheep in the  darkness. His shot was answered by a yelp and a quick rush. Colin  bounded to his side, sniffed, and darted into the herd.    A commotion followed.    There was a struggle, a low growl of rage.    Then the collie trotted back to Donald's side dragging in his teeth a  limp mass which he dropped at the lad's feet.    The boy struck a match and turned the creature over with his foot.    It was a coyote!    Then how glad he was that he had not left his post!    At dawn Sandy came to relieve him. The herder glanced first at the dead  coyote, then at some faint tracks in the moist earth.    \"You have interrupted a midnight orgy, Don,\" he declared at last,  rubbing his hands together as he always did when anything pleased him  very much. \"Here are the marks of at least four coyotes that were  stealing down on the flock when you fired. You got this one, and  evidently drove off the others. I wish we had had as good luck on our  side of the fold. In spite of his watchfulness Bernardo lost two lambs.  He is one of our best herders, too, and he is sore about it. You have  done a good night's work, lad. I am proud of my pupil!\"    And as Donald heard Sandy's words his lips parted in a smile and he felt  he would have patrolled a line twice as long to have earned the young  Scotchman's praise.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER X    A PREDICTION THAT CAME TRUE      When the lambs were three weeks old Sandy decided to break camp, leave  the fenced lambing-pasture, and push on to higher ground.    \"The sun is getting hot and we must have cooler quarters,\" he explained.  \"By nature sheep seek elevated ground, you know, and their health is  better there. Now that their fleeces are getting so much thicker the  poor beasts are too warm in the low places. What is more, they need the  exercise of climbing. Grass, too, is becoming scant and we must not eat  it down too close.\"    Mr. Clark agreed.    Therefore a clear July morning saw the vast herd winding its way up the  steep incline of the mountainside. Sandy went on ahead, guiding the  flock to the best pasturage and the freshest water-holes. The lambs  trotted at their mother's sides or frisked after them with the  playfulness of kittens. When a plentiful water supply and rich grass was  found Sandy often delayed the upward march a week or more, that the  flock might make the most of the lush herbage. When feed was meager  there were days of scrambling up rocky stretches, and nights of  patrolling the fold. Then more days of climbing would follow. Sometimes  a scarcity of water forced them to press on against their will.    They had now reached a high elevation, but the warmth of the July  weather rendered the coolness welcome. The sheep gladly sought out the  forest shade or, when they were above the timber-line, rested in the  shadow of the high rocks. This rough land seemed to be the favorite  place for their sports, and Donald and his father were never tired  watching them.    A single sheep would mount a boulder, from which vantage ground he would  stand looking down at the herd. In a moment several of the flock would  rush forward, butt him from the rock, and one of them would take his  place, only to be driven down and succeeded by the next victor. The  sheep often played this for a long time.    \"It is a good game, too,\" declared Sandy, \"for to rush up the side of a  high rock like that and not slip back makes them sure-footed.\"    Another game the flock sometimes played was Follow the Leader, one old  ewe marching ahead, followed by a line of sheep that went wherever she  led them.    \"They play it almost as well as we did at school,\" said Donald, much  amused.    \"That is a useful game too,\" went on Sandy. \"By playing it the young  lambs learn to follow the others, and do what they do. That is one way  they get training to keep in the herd and obey the mind of the leader.  It is really more of a lesson than a game. I suspect, though, they are  like us--so long as they think it is a game they like to play it.  Perhaps, now, if we were to hint to them it was a lesson they might  never play it again.\"    Donald chuckled.    There were many times when it seemed to him that Sandy must be a boy of  fourteen instead of a man of forty; yet the next moment the Scotchman  would address him with the gravity of a grandfather, and immediately  Donald felt very young indeed. A strange mixture of youth and wisdom was  Sandy McCulloch!    As the lambs were now old enough to travel with the flock there was no  further need for the Mexicans to linger on the range, and they therefore  went back over the trail to busy themselves at the home ranch until  shearing time. The camp-tender, too, did not now take time to make the  difficult journey up into the mountains, but left supplies at a given  spot in the lower pastures, or met some of the party half-way and  delivered over the provisions. If the rations were left it fell to the  lot of one of the campers on the upper range to ride down on the pony  and bring back \"the grub,\" as Sandy called it. Once when Mr. Clark went  down it was only to find that the supplies had been scented out by a  bear and dragged away; in consequence the party on the mountain were  forced to get on without bread or fresh provisions until the tender made  his next round.    At times it was Donald's turn to make this trip; on other days Sandy or  Bernardo went. As there was always the chance of meeting a grizzly or a  rattler the journey was not without its perils.    Thus the summer passed.    Then came the fall days, when threatened cold made it necessary to turn  the heads of the herd toward the lower hills of the winter range.  Downward they wended their way. Flurries of snow caught them unawares  and at these blizzards Sandy's face always became grave, for it was in  one of these sudden squalls that his father, Old Angus, had perished.  Although the days were chilly and the nights still colder, Mr. Clark and  Donald kept resolutely with the flock; but when they reached the  lowlands and the Scotch herder directed his band of sheep toward the  bronzed fields of sage-brush and dried hay lying along the river valley  Donald and his father bade good-bye to Bernardo and Sandy and returned  to the shelter of the home ranch.    Thornton welcomed them.    There was something new in his manner--a strange, unaccustomed dignity  which lent to the man a charm he had never before possessed.    \"Thornton did not shuffle toward us and look down as he usually does,\"  observed Donald to his father when they were alone. \"He is different,  somehow. What is it?\"    \"I am not sure, son, but I cannot help feeling that Thornton has come to  his best self. The best is in all of us. It is not, however, always  uppermost. Perhaps it is going to triumph in Thornton.\"    There unquestionably was a change in the big rough man.    That evening he got out the books and went over all the accounts with  Mr. Clark, telling him just what supplies he had ordered; what they had  cost; and how much he had paid out in wages. In dealing with financial  matters Mr. Clark was on his native heath. He studied the columns of  figures critically. The accounts were correct to a cent, and he could  readily see that every reasonable economy had been practiced in the  management of the ranch.    \"You have done well, Thornton,\" he said after he had finished looking  over the bills and papers. \"I am greatly obliged to you for your  faithful work.\"    Donald saw a flush of pleasure rise to the man's cheek.    \"My work has not always been faithful, Mr. Clark,\" Thornton declared  with sudden determination. \"I want to tell you, sir, that I was not  setting out to be faithful to you at all. I wanted to get Johnson's  place, and then I meant to run Crescent Ranch to please myself. I am  going to confess the whole thing; I want to confess it because your  confidence in me has made me ashamed of myself. You must have known  somehow that I was not running things as they ought to be run, else you  would never have come out here. Sandy knew it--so did all the old  herders. Yet, save about the permits, you never have spoken a word of  reproof, but have gone on trusting me. When you looked me so kindly in  the eye and went away leaving me in care of the whole home ranch I  somehow felt that you expected me to do the square thing.\"    His voice faltered.    Donald, who had "]]]
