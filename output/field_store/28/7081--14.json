[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#14)"],[1,"were  the very men who are well-known to be such cruel, bloodthirsty fiends  when under the influence of their dreadful superstitions, and who, but a  few hours before, had been darting through the woods besmeared with  blood and yelling like maniacs or demons.  In fact, the whole scene  before me, and the day's proceedings, seemed to me, at that time, like a  vivid dream instead of a reality.  Moreover, after I lay down, the  reality became a dream, and I spent that night, as I had spent the day,  shooting gazelles, lions, wild pigs, and elephants in imagination.        CHAPTER SIX.    DREAMING AND FEEDING AND BLOODY WORK ENLARGED UPON.    The first object of which my senses became cognisant on awaking next  morning was my friend Peterkin, who had evidently awakened just a moment  or two before me, for he was in the act of yawning and rubbing his eyes.    I have all my life been a student of character, and the most interesting  yet inexplicable character which I have ever studied has been that of my  friend Peterkin, whose eccentricities I have never been able fully to  understand or account for.  I have observed that, on first awaking in  the mornings, he has been wont to exhibit several of his most eccentric  and peculiar traits, so I resolved to feign myself asleep and watch him.    \"Heigh-ho!\" he exclaimed, after the yawn I have just referred to.  Having said this, he stretched out both arms to the utmost above his  head, and then flung himself back at full length on his couch, where he  lay still for about half a minute.  Then he started up suddenly into a  sitting posture and looked slowly from one to another of the recumbent  forms around him.  Satisfied, apparently, that they were asleep, he gave  vent to a long yawn which terminated in a gasp, and then he looked up  contemplatively at the sky, which was at that hour beginning to warm  with the red rays of the rising sun.  While thus engaged, he caressed  with his right hand the very small scrap of whisker that grew on his  right cheek.  At first it seemed as if this were an unconscious action,  but he suddenly appeared to become absorbed in it, and stared straight  before him as one does when only half awake, mumbling the while in an  undertone.  I could not make out distinctly what he said, but I think I  caught the words, \"Yes, a little--a _very_ little thicker--six new  hairs, I think--umph! slow, very slow.\"  Here he looked at Jack's bushy  beard and sighed.    Suddenly he thrust both hands deep into his breeches pockets and stared  at the black embers of the extinct fire; then as suddenly he pulled out  his hands, and placing the forefinger of his right hand on the end of  the thumb of his left, said slowly--    \"Let me see--I'll recall it.\"    He spoke with intense gravity.  Most persons do when talking to  themselves.    \"Yes, I remember now.  There were two elephants and four--or three, was  it?--no, it must have been four lions.  The biggest elephant had on a  false front of fair curls and a marriage-ring on its tail.  Stay; was it  not the other one had that?  No, it was the biggest.  I remember now,  for it was just above the marriage-ring I grasped it when I pulled its  tail out.  I didn't pull it off, for it wouldn't come off; it came out  like a telescope or a long piece of indiarubber.  Ha! and I remember  thinking how painful it must be.  That was odd, now, to think of that.  The other elephant had on crinoline.  That was odder still; for of all  animals in the world it least required it.  Well, let me see.  What did  I do?  Oh yes, I shot them both.  Of course, that was natural; but it  wasn't quite so natural that the big one should vomit up a live lion,  which attacked me with incredible fury.  But I killed it cleverly.  Yes,  it _was_ a clever thing, undoubtedly, to split a lion in two, from the  tip of its nose to the extremity of its tail, with one stroke of a  penknife--\"    At this climax I could contain myself no longer, and burst into a loud  laugh as I perceived that Peterkin had spent the night, as I myself had  done, in hunting--though, I confess, there was a considerable difference  in the nature of our achievements, and in the manner of their  accomplishment.    \"Why, what are you laughing at?\" said Jack, sitting up and gazing at me  with a stupid stare.    \"At Peterkin's dreams,\" said I.    \"Ah!\" said Jack, with a smiling yawn, \"that's it, is it?  Been hunting  elephants and lions, eh?\"    \"Why, how did you guess that?\"  I asked, in surprise; \"were you not  asleep just now?\"    \"Of course I was, and dreaming too, like yourself, I make no doubt.  I  had just bagged my fifteenth elephant and my tenth lion when your laugh  awoke me.  And the best of it is that I was carrying the whole bagful on  my back at once, and did not feel much oppressed by the weight.\"    \"That beats my dream hollow,\" observed Peterkin; \"so its my opinion we'd  better have breakfast.--Makarooroo, hy! d'ye hear? rouse up, you junk of  ebony.\"    \"Yis, massa, comin',\" said our guide, rising slowly from his lair on the  opposite side of our fireplace.    \"D'you hear?\"    \"Yis, massa.\"    \"You're a nigger!\"    \"Dat am a fact.\"    \"Well, being a nigger you're a brick, so look sharp with that splendid  breakfast you promised us last night.  I'll wager a million pounds that  you had forgotten all about it.\"    \"No, massa, me no forgit.  Me up in centre ob de night and put 'im in de  hole.  Wat you call 'im--oben?\"    \"Ay, oven, that's it.\"    \"Yis.  Well, me git 'im d'rec'ly.\"    \"And, I say, hold on,\" added Peterkin.  \"Don't you suppose I'm going to  stand on ceremony with you.  Your name's too long by half.  Too many  rooroos about it, so I'm going to call you Mak in future, d'ye  understand?\"    The negro nodded and grinned from ear to ear as he left us.  Presently  he returned with a huge round, or lump of meat, at which we looked  inquisitively.  The odour from it was delightful, and the tender, juicy  appearance of the meat when Makarooroo, who carved it for us, cut the  first slice, was quite appetising to behold.    \"What is it?\" inquired Peterkin.    \"Elephant's foot,\" replied the guide.    \"Gammon,\" remarked Peterkin.    \"It's true, massa.  Don't you see him's toe?\"    \"So it is,\" said Jack.    \"And it's first-rate,\" cried I, tasting a morsel.    With that we fell to and made a hearty meal, after which we, along with  the king and all his people, retraced our steps to the river and  returned to the native town, where we spent another day in making  preparations to continue our journey towards the land of the gorilla.    During the hunt which I have just described I was very much amused as  well as amazed at the reckless manner in which the negroes loaded their  rusty old trade-guns.  They put in a whole handful of powder each time,  and above that as much shot and bits of old iron of all kinds as they  dared; some I saw charged thus to within a few inches of the muzzle, and  the owners seemed actually afraid to put them to their shoulders, as  well they might be, for the recoil was tremendous, and had the powder  been good their guns must have been blown to pieces and themselves  killed.    On our return to the village we found the people on the eve of one of  those terrible outbursts of superstitious passion which rarely if ever  pass away without some wretched human creature perishing under the hands  of murderers.    \"There is something wrong with the fetishman, I think,\" remarked Jack,  as we disembarked at the landing.  \"He seems excited.  Do you know what  it can be at, Makarooroo?\"    \"Jack,\" interposed Peterkin, \"I have changed his name to Mak, so you and  Ralph will please to remember that.--Mak, my boy, what's wrong with your  doctor?\"    The negro looked very grave and shook his head as he replied, \"Don'  know, massa.  Him's be goin' to rizz de peepil wid him norrible doin's.  Dere will be death in the camp mos' bery quick--p'raps dis night.\"    \"That is terrible,\" said I.  \"Are you sure of what you say?\"    \"Sartin sure,\" replied the negro, with another shake of the head.    \"Then, Mak,\" said Jack, \"it behoves us to look to ourselves.  You look  like an honest fellow, and I believe we may trust you.  We cannot expect  you to help us to fight against your own kith and kin, but I do expect  that you will assist us to escape if any foul play is intended.  Whatever betides, it is as well that you should know that white men are  not easily conquered.  Our guns are good--they never miss fire.  We will  sell our lives dearly, you may depend on it.\"    \"Ay,\" added Peterkin, \"it is well that you should know that; moreover,  it is well that the rascally niggers of your tribe should know it too;  so you can take occasion to give them a hint that we shall keep  ourselves prepared for them, with my compliments.\"    \"De mans ob my peepil,\" replied the negro, with some dignity of manner,  \"be not wuss dan oder mans.  But dem is bad enuff.  But you no hab need  for be fraid.  Dey no touch de white mans.  Dem bery much glad you com'  here.  If any bodies be killed it be black mans or 'oomans.\"    We felt somewhat relieved on hearing this, for, to say truth, we knew  well enough that three men, no matter how well-armed or resolute they  might be, could not hope to defend themselves against a whole tribe of  savages in their own country.  Nevertheless we resolved to keep a sharp  lookout, and be prepared for the worst.  Meanwhile we did all in our  power to expedite our departure.    That evening the trader started on his return journey to the coast,  leaving us in charge of King Jambai, who promised earnestly to take good  care of us.  We immediately put his willingness to fulfil his promise to  the test by begging him to furnish us with men to carry our goods into  the interior.  He tried very hard to induce us to change our minds and  remain hunting with his tribe, telling us that the gorilla country was  far far away from his lands; that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#14)"],[1," softer and richer, where there is a greater union between the  figures and the ground, such as the \"Seven Sacraments\" in the Duke of  Orleans' collection; but neither these, nor any in this manner, are at  all comparable to many in his dry manner which we have in England.    The favourite subjects of Poussin were ancient fables; and no painter was  ever better qualified to paint such subjects, not only from his being  eminently skilled in the knowledge of ceremonies, customs, and habits of  the ancients, but from his being so well acquainted with the different  characters which those who invented them gave their allegorical figures.  Though Rubens has shown great fancy in his Satyrs, Silenuses, and Fauns,  yet they are not that distinct separate class of beings which is  carefully exhibited by the ancients and by Poussin.  Certainly when such  subjects of antiquity are represented, nothing in the picture ought to  remind us of modern times.  The mind is thrown back into antiquity, and  nothing ought to be introduced that may tend to awaken it from the  illusion.    Poussin seemed to think that the style and the language in which such  stories are told is not the worse for preserving some relish of the old  way of painting which seemed to give a general uniformity to the whole,  so that the mind was thrown back into antiquity not only by the subject,  but the execution.    If Poussin, in imitation of the ancients, represents Apollo driving his  chariot out of the sea by way of representing the sun rising, if he  personifies lakes and rivers, it is no ways offensive in him; but seems  perfectly of a piece with the general air of the picture.  On the  contrary, if the figures which people his pictures had a modern air or  countenance, if they appeared like our countrymen, if the draperies were  like cloth or silk of our manufacture, if the landscape had the  appearance of a modern view, how ridiculous would Apollo appear instead  of the sun, an old man or a nymph with an urn instead of a river or lake.    I cannot avoid mentioning here a circumstance in portrait painting which  may help to confirm what has been said.    When a portrait is painted in the historical style, as it is neither an  exact minute representation of an individual nor completely ideal, every  circumstance ought to correspond to this mixture.  The simplicity of the  antique air and attitude, however much to be admired, is ridiculous when  joined to a figure in a modern dress.  It is not to my purpose to enter  into the question at present, whether this mixed style ought to be  adopted or not; yet if it is chosen it is necessary it should be complete  and all of a piece: the difference of stuffs, for instance, which make  the clothing, should be distinguished in the same degree as the head  deviates from a general idea.    Without this union, which I have so often recommended, a work can have no  marked and determined character, which is the peculiar and constant  evidence of genius.  But when this is accomplished to a high degree, it  becomes in some sort a rival to that style which we have fixed as the  highest.    Thus I have given a sketch of the characters of Rubens and Salvator Rosa,  as they appear to me to have the greatest uniformity of mind throughout  their whole work.  But we may add to these, all these artists who are at  the head of the class, and have had a school of imitators from Michael  Angelo down to Watteau.  Upon the whole it appears that setting aside the  ornamental style, there are two different paths, either of which a  student may take without degrading the dignity of his art.  The first is  to combine the higher excellences and embellish them to the greatest  advantage.  The other is to carry one of these excellences to the highest  degree.  But those who possess neither must be classed with them, who, as  Shakespeare says, are men of no mark or likelihood.    I inculcate as frequently as I can your forming yourselves upon great  principles and great models.  Your time will be much misspent in every  other pursuit.  Small excellences should be viewed, not studied; they  ought to be viewed, because nothing ought to escape a painter's  observation, but for no other reason.    There is another caution which I wish to give you.  Be as select in those  whom you endeavour to please, as in those whom you endeavour to imitate.  Without the love of fame you can never do anything excellent; but by an  excessive and undistinguishing thirst after it, you will come to have  vulgar views; you will degrade your style; and your taste will be  entirely corrupted.  It is certain that the lowest style will be the most  popular, as it falls within the compass of ignorance itself; and the  vulgar will always be pleased with what is natural in the confined and  misunderstood sense of the word.    One would wish that such depravation of taste should be counteracted,  with such manly pride as Euripides expressed to the Athenians, who  criticised his works, \"I do not compose,\" says he, \"my works in order to  be corrected by you, but to instruct you.\"  It is true, to have a right  to speak thus, a man must be a Euripides.  However, thus much may be  allowed, that when an artist is sure that he is upon firm ground,  supported by the authority and practice of his predecessors of the  greatest reputation, he may then assume the boldness and intrepidity of  genius; at any rate, he must not be tempted out of the right path by any  tide of popularity that always accompanies the lower styles of painting.    I mention this, because our exhibitions, that produce such admirable  effects by nourishing emulation, and calling out genius, have also a  mischievous tendency by seducing the painter to an ambition of pleasing  indiscriminately the mixed multitude of people who resort to them.        A DISCOURSE  Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution of the  Prizes, December 10, 1774, by the President.      Gentlemen,--When I have taken the liberty of addressing you on the course  and order of your studies, I never proposed to enter into a minute detail  of the art.  This I have always left to the several professors, who  pursue the end of our institution with the highest honour to themselves,  and with the greatest advantage to the students.    My purpose in the discourses I have held in the Academy is to lay down  certain general ideas, which seem to me proper for the formation of a  sound taste; principles necessary to guard the pupils against those  errors into which the sanguine temper common at their time of life, has a  tendency to lead them, and which have rendered abortive the hopes of so  many successions of promising young men in all parts of Europe.    I wish, also, to intercept and suppress those prejudices which  particularly prevail when the mechanism of painting is come to its  perfection, and which when they do prevail are certain to prevail to the  utter destruction of the higher and more valuable parts of this literate  and liberal profession.    These two have been my principal purposes; they are still as much my  concern as ever; and if I repeat my own ideas on the subject, you who  know how fast mistake and prejudice, when neglected, gain ground upon  truth and reason, will easily excuse me.  I only attempt to set the same  thing in the greatest variety of lights.    The subject of this discourse will be imitation, as far as a painter is  concerned in it.  By imitation I do not mean imitation in its largest  sense, but simply the following of other masters, and the advantage to be  drawn from the study of their works.    Those who have undertaken to write on our art, and have represented it as  a kind of inspiration, as a gift bestowed upon peculiar favourites at  their birth, seem to ensure a much more favourable disposition from their  readers, and have a much more captivating and liberal air, than he who  goes about to examine, coldly, whether there are any means by which this  art may be acquired; how our mind may be strengthened and expanded, and  what guides will show the way to eminence.    It is very natural for those who are unacquainted with the cause of  anything extraordinary to be astonished at the effect, and to consider it  as a kind of magic.  They, who have never observed the gradation by which  art is acquired, who see only what is the full result of long labour and  application of an infinite number, and infinite variety of acts, are apt  to conclude from their entire inability to do the same at once, that it  is not only inaccessible to themselves, but can be done by those only who  have some gift of the nature of inspiration bestowed upon them.    The travellers into the East tell us that when the ignorant inhabitants  of these countries are asked concerning the ruins of stately edifices yet  remaining amongst them, the melancholy monuments of their former grandeur  and long-lost science, they always answer that they were built by  magicians.  The untaught mind finds a vast gulf between its own powers  and these works of complicated art which it is utterly unable to fathom.  And it supposes that such a void can be passed only by supernatural  powers.    And, as for artists themselves, it is by no means their interest to  undeceive such judges, however conscious they may be of the very natural  means by which the extraordinary powers were acquired; our art being  intrinsically imitative, rejects this idea of inspiration more, perhaps,  than any other.    It is to avoid this plain confession of truth, as it should seem, that  this imitation of masters--indeed, almost all imitation which implies a  more regular and progressive method of attaining the ends of painting--has  ever been particularly inveighed against with great keenness, both by  ancient and modern writers.    To derive all from native power, to owe nothing to another, is the praise  which men, who do not much think what they"]]]
