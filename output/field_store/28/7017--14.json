When we came to pay our bill, the dolt of a husband took the money and  put it in his pocket. He had not lifted a finger to lighten that  woman's burdens.... Yet the law gives him the right to every dollar  she earns, and when she needs two cents to buy a darning needle she  has to ask him and explain what she wants it for.\"[65]    When after a few weeks Mrs. Gage was called home by illness in her  family, Susan appealed hopefully to Lucretia Mott's sister, Martha C.  Wright, in Auburn, New York, \"You can speak so much better, so much  more wisely, so much more everything than I can.\" Then she added, \"I  should like a particular effort made to call out the Teachers, the  Sewing Women, the Working Women generally--Can't you write something  for your papers that will make them feel that it is for them that we  work more than [for] the wives and daughters of the rich?\"[66] Mrs.  Wright, however, could help only in Auburn, and Susan was obliged to  continue her scheduled meetings alone. She interrupted them only to  present her petitions to the legislature.    The response of the legislature to her two years of hard work was a  sarcastic, wholly irrelevant report issued by the judiciary committee  some weeks later to a Senate roaring with laughter. In the Albany  _Register_ Susan read with mounting indignation portions of this  infuriating report: \"The ladies always have the best places and the  choicest tidbit at the table. They have the best seats in cars,  carriages, and sleighs; the warmest place in winter, the coolest in  summer. They have their choice on which side of the bed they will lie,  front or back. A lady's dress costs three times as much as that of a  gentleman; and at the present time, with the prevailing fashion, one  lady occupies three times as much space in the world as a gentleman.  It has thus appeared to the married gentlemen of your committee, being  a majority ... that if there is any inequality or oppression in the  case, the gentlemen are the sufferers. They, however, have presented  no petitions for redress, having doubtless made up their minds to  yield to an inevitable destiny.\"[67]    Why, Susan wondered sadly, were woman's rights only a joke to most  men--something to be laughed at even in the face of glaring proofs of  the law's injustice.    There was encouragement, however, in the letters which now came from  Lucy Stone in Ohio: \"Hurrah Susan! Last week this State Legislature  passed a law giving wives equal property rights, and to mothers equal  baby rights with fathers. So much is gained. The petitions which I set  on foot in Wisconsin for suffrage have been presented, made a rousing  discussion, and then were tabled with three men to defend them!... In  Nebraska too, the bill for suffrage passed the House.... The world  moves!\"[68]    The world was moving in Great Britain as well, for as Susan read in  her newspaper, women there were petitioning Parliament for married  women's property rights, and among the petitioners were her  well-beloved Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Harriet Martineau, Mrs.  Gaskell, and Charlotte Cushman. Better still, Harriet Taylor, inspired  by the example of woman's rights conventions in America, had written  for the _Westminster Review_ an article advocating the enfranchisement  of women.    All this reassured Susan, even if New York legislators laughed at her  efforts.      FOOTNOTES:    [43] Judge William Hay of Saratoga Springs, New York.

NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS      Susan's thoughts during the summer of 1856 often strayed from woman's  rights meetings toward Kansas, where her brother Merritt had settled  on a claim near Osawatomie. Well aware of his eagerness to help John  Brown, she knew that he must be in the thick of the bloody antislavery  struggle. In fact the whole Anthony family had been anxiously waiting  for news from Merritt ever since the wires had flashed word in May  1856 of the burning of Lawrence by proslavery \"border ruffians\" from  Missouri and of John Brown's raid in retaliation at Pottawatomie  Creek.    Merritt had built a log cabin at Osawatomie. While Susan was at home  in September, the newspapers reported an attack by proslavery men on  Osawatomie in which thirty out of fifty settlers were killed. Was  Merritt among them? Finally letters came through from him. Susan read  and reread them, assuring herself of his safety. Although ill at the  time, he had been in the thick of the fight, but was unharmed. Weak  from the exertion he had crawled back to his cabin on his hands and  knees and had lain there ill and alone for several weeks.    Parts of Merritt's letters were published in the Rochester _Democrat_,  and the city took sides in the conflict, some papers claiming that his  letters were fiction. Susan wrote Merritt, \"How much rather would I  have you at my side tonight than to think of your daring and enduring  greater hardships even than our Revolutionary heroes. Words cannot  tell how often we think of you or how sadly we feel that the terrible  crime of this nation against humanity is being avenged on the heads of  our sons and brothers.... Father brings the _Democrat_ giving a list  of killed, wounded, and missing and the name of our Merritt is not  therein, but oh! the slain are sons, brothers, and husbands of others  as dearly loved and sadly mourned.\"[69]    With difficulty, she prepared for the annual woman's rights  convention, for the country was in a state of unrest not only over  Kansas and the whole antislavery question, but also over the  presidential campaign with three candidates in the field. Even her  faithful friends Horace Greeley and Gerrit Smith now failed her,  Horace Greeley writing that he could no longer publish her notices  free in the news columns of his _Tribune_, because they cast upon him  the stigma of ultraradicalism, and Gerrit Smith withholding his  hitherto generous financial support because woman's rights conventions  would not press for dress reform--comfortable clothing for women  suitable for an active life, which he believed to be the foundation  stone of women's emancipation.    [Illustration: Merritt Anthony]    She watched the lively bitter presidential campaign with interest and  concern. The new Republican party was in the contest, offering its  first presidential candidate, the colorful hero and explorer of the  far West, John C. Fremont. She had leanings toward this virile young  party which stood firmly against the extension of slavery in the  territories, and discussed its platform with Elizabeth and Henry B.  Stanton, both enthusiastically for \"Fremont and Freedom.\" Yet she was  distrustful of political parties, for they eventually yielded to  expediency, no matter how high their purpose at the start. Her ideal  was the Garrisonian doctrine, \"No Union with Slaveholders\" and  \"Immediate Unconditional Emancipation,\" which courageously faced the  \"whole question\" of slavery. There was no compromise among  Garrisonians.    With the burning issue of slavery now uppermost in her mind, she began  seriously to reconsider the offer she had received from the American  Antislavery Society, shortly after her visit to Boston in 1855, to act  as their agent in central and western New York. Unable to accept at  that time because she was committed to her woman's rights program, she  had nevertheless felt highly honored that she had been chosen. Still  hesitating a little, she wrote Lucy Stone, wanting reassurance that no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#14)"],[1,"\"great  reformer's\" own position, will not be lost upon the reader.    Thus, not only is the devil the cause of pestilence, but he is also  the immediate agent of nightmare and of nightsweats. At Moelburg in  Thueringen, near Erfurt, a piper, who was accustomed to pipe at  weddings, complained to his priest that the devil had threatened to  carry him away and destroy him, on the ground of a practical joke  played upon some companions, to wit, for having mixed horse-dung with  their wine at a drinking bout. The priest consoled him with many  passages of Scripture anent the devil and his ways, with the result  that the piper expressed himself satisfied as regarded the welfare of  his soul, but apprehensive as regarded that of his body, which was, he  asserted, hopelessly the prey of the devil. In consequence of this, he  insisted on partaking of the Sacrament. The devil had indicated to him  when he was going to be fetched, and watchers were accordingly placed  in his room, who sat in their armour and with their weapons, and read  the Bible to him. Finally, one Saturday at midnight, a violent storm  arose, that blew out the lights in the room, and hurled the luckless  victim out of a narrow window into the street. The sound of fighting  and of armed men was heard, but the piper had disappeared. The next  morning he was found in a neighbouring ditch, with his arms stretched  out in the form of a cross, dead and coal-black. Luther vouches for  the truth of this story, which he alleges to have been told him by a  parish priest of Gotha, who had himself heard it from the parish  priest of Moelburg, where the event was said to have taken place.    Amongst the numerous anecdotes of a supernatural character told by  \"Dr. Martin\" is one of a \"Poltergeist,\" or \"Robin Goodfellow,\" who was  exorcised by two monks from the guest-chamber of an inn, and who  offered his services to them in the monastery. They gave him a corner  in the kitchen. The serving-boy used to torment him by throwing dirty  water over him. After unavailing protests, the spirit hung the boy up  to a beam, but let him down again before serious harm resulted. Luther  states that this \"brownie\" was well known by sight in the neighbouring  town (the name of which he does not give). But by far the larger  number of his stories, which, be it observed, are warranted as  ordinary occurrences, as to the possibility of which there was no  question, are coloured by that more sinister side of supernaturalism  so much emphasised by the new theology.    The mediaeval devil was, for the most part, himself little more than a  prankish Ruebezahl, or Robin Goodfellow; the new Satan of the  Reformers was, in very deed, an arch-fiend, the enemy of the human  race, with whom no truce or parley might be held. The old folklore  belief in _incubi_ and _succubi_ as the parents of changelings is  brought into connection with the theory of direct diabolic begettal.  Thus Luther relates how Friedrich, the Elector of Saxony, told him of  a noble family that had sprung from a _succubus_: \"Just,\" says he, \"as  the Melusina at Luxembourg was also such a _succubus_, or devil.\" In  the case referred to, the _succubus_ assumed the shape of the man's  dead wife, and lived with him and bore him children, until, one day,  he swore at her, when she vanished, leaving only her clothes behind.  After giving it as his opinion that all such beings and their  offspring are wiles of the devil, he proceeds: \"It is truly a grievous  thing that the devil can so plague men that he begetteth children in  their likeness. It is even so with the nixies in the water, that lure  a man therein, in the shape of wife or maid, with whom he doth dally  and begetteth offspring of them.\" The change whereby the beings of the  old naive folklore are transformed into the devil or his agents is  significant of that darker side of the new theology, which was  destined to issue in those horrors of the witchcraft-mania that  reached their height at the beginning of the following century.    One more story of a \"changeling\" before we leave the subject. Luther  gives us the following as having come to his knowledge near  Halberstadt, in Saxony. A peasant had a baby, who sucked out its  mother and five nurses, besides eating a great deal. Concluding that  it was a changeling, the peasant sought the advice of his neighbours,  who suggested that he should take it on a pilgrimage to a neighbouring  shrine of the Mother of God. While he was crossing a brook on the way  an impish voice from under the water called out to the infant, whom he  was carrying in a basket. The brat answered from within the basket,  \"Ho, ho!\" and the peasant was unspeakably shocked. When the voice from  the water proceeded to ask the child what it was after, and received  the answer from the hitherto inarticulate babe that it was going to be  laid on the shrine of the Mother of God, to the end that it might  prosper, the peasant could stand it no longer, and flung basket and  baby into the brook. The changeling and the little devil played for a  few moments with each other, rolling over and over, and crying, \"Ho,  ho, ho!\" and then they disappeared together. Luther says that these  devilish brats may be generally known by their eating and drinking too  much, and especially by their exhausting their mother's milk, but they  may not develop any certain signs of their true parentage until  eighteen or nineteen years old. The Princess of Anhalt had a child  which Luther imagined to be a changeling, and he therefore advised its  being drowned, alleging that such creatures were only lumps of flesh  animated by the devil or his angels. Some one spoke of a monster which  infested the Netherlands, and which went about smelling at people like  a dog, and whoever it smelt died. But those that were smelt did not  see it, albeit the bystanders did. The people had recourse to vigils  and masses. Luther improved the occasion to protest against the  \"superstition\" of masses for the dead, and to insist upon his  favourite dogma of faith as the true defence against assaults of the  devil.    Among the numerous stories of Satanic compacts, we are told of a monk  who ate up a load of hay, of a debtor who bit off the leg of his  Hebrew creditor and ran off to avoid payment, and of a woman who  bewitched her husband so that he vomited lizards. Luther observes,  with especial reference to this last case, that lawyers and judges  were far too pedantic with their witnesses and with their evidence;  that the devil hardens his clients against torture, and that the  refusal to confess under torture ought to be of itself sufficient  proof of dealings with the Prince of Darkness. \"Towards such,\" says  he, \"we would show no mercy; I would burn them myself.\" Black magic or  witchcraft he proceeds to characterize as the greatest sin a human  being can be guilty of, as, in fact, high treason against God  Himself--_crimen laesae majestatis divinae_.    The conversation closes with a story of how Maximilian's father, the  Emperor Friedrich, who seems to have obtained a reputation for magic  arts, invited a well-known magician to a banquet, and on his arrival  fixed claws on his hands and hoofs on his feet by his cunning. His  guest, being ashamed, tried to hide the claws under the table as long  as he could, but finally he had to show them, to his great  discomfiture. But he determined to have his revenge, and asked his  host whether he would permit him to give proofs of his own skill. The  Emperor assenting, there at once arose a great noise outside the  window. Friedrich sprang up from the table, and leaned out of the  casement to see what was the matter. Immediately an enormous pair of  stag's horns appeared on his head, so that he could not draw it back.  Finding the state of the case, the Emperor exclaimed: \"Rid me of them  again! Thou hast won!\" Luther's comment on this was that he was always  glad to see one devil getting the better of another, as it showed  that some were stronger than others.    All this belongs, roughly speaking, to the side of the matter which  regards popular theology; but there is another side which is connected  more especially with the New Learning. This other school, which sought  to bring the somewhat elastic elements of the magical theory of the  universe into the semblance of a systematic whole, is associated with  such names as those of Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, and the Abbot  von Trittenheim. The fame of the first-named was so great throughout  Germany that when he visited any town the occasion was looked upon as  an event of exceeding importance.[12] Paracelsus fully shared in the  beliefs of his age, in spite of his brilliant insights on certain  occasions. What his science was like may be imagined when we learn  that he seriously speaks of animals who conceive through the mouth of  basilisks whose glance is deadly, of petrified storks changed into  snakes, of the stillborn young of the lion which are afterwards  brought to life by the roar of their sire, of frogs falling in a  shower of rain, of ducks transformed into frogs, and of men born from  beasts; the menstruation of women he regarded as a venom whence  proceeded flies, spiders, earwigs, and all sorts of loathsome vermin;  night was caused, not by the absence of the sun, but by the presence  of the stars, which were the positive cause of the darkness. He  relates having seen a magnet capable of attracting the eyeball from  its socket as far as the tip of the nose; he knows of salves to close  the mouth so effectually that it has to be broken open again by  mechanical means, and he writes learnedly on the infallible signs of  witchcraft. By mixing horse-dung with human semen he believed he was  able to produce a medium from which, by chemical treatment in a  retort, a diminutive human being, or _homunculus_, as he called it,  could be produced.
