The jewellery, said at one time to have been worn by Queen  Cleopatra, attracted much attention, as did also specimens of  boomerangs--a weapon which almost every Australian had thought was  peculiar to his own country.    Time did not permit of visits up the Nile to the ruins at Luxor, Thebes,  Philae, and Karnak, so the programme of viewing ancient remains had to  be somewhat restricted. Consequently little was now left to do except to  visit Mataria (about four miles north of the camp), view the Tree and  Well associated with the Flight out of Egypt, and then proceed to the  obelisk near by, which marks the site of the old Heliopolis--the City of  the Sun.    Other and more modern buildings and structures, connected with the early  Christians and the Saracens, are plentiful in Cairo, and to these the  visitors now turned. Chief amongst them is the Citadel, the erection of  which Saladin began in A.D. 1166. From its walls a fine view of the city  and its environs can be obtained. To the south the Aqueduct built by the  Saracens comes under observation; and near by, on the east side, the  Moqattam Hills--scarred by quarries and surmounted by a fort from which  Napoleon silenced the guns of the Citadel. Within Saladin's walls are to  be seen Joseph's Well--some 300 feet deep; the costly mosque of Mehemet  Ali with its dome and twin minarets; two or three smaller and older  mosques; and, on the wall, the hoof print of the escaping Mameluke's  horse.    Opposite to the main entrance to the Citadel, and without the walls, are  two mosques of unusual size. One, the mosque of the Sultan Hassan--noted  amongst other things for its wonderful arches, doors inlaid with gold,  and a cannon ball still sticking in the wall facing the hills which bear  Napoleon's fort; the other containing the tombs of the Khedivial family  and distinguished by the richness of the decorations and inlay of  sandalwood, ebony, silver, and ivory.    Mosques and shrines in Cairo number nearly 500. There is plenty to see  in this respect, but after a few of the principal ones, including the  Blue Mosque of Ibrahim Agha, had been inspected, and similar calls paid  on some of the old Coptic churches, interest waned and the soldier,  looking for a change, sometimes turned to the Roman and Arab remains in  Old Cairo and Fustat, or else visited the Tombs of the Khalifs and  Mamelukes on the edge of the desert. Here he was, perhaps, successful in  obtaining genuine souvenirs of the \"Dead City.\"    [Illustration: CAIRO AND ENVIRONS]    Apart from short trips on the Nile, per steam dahabiyehs, two other  excursions must be mentioned. One was to the Island of Roda to view  the spot where the infant Moses is alleged to have been found by the  Pharoah's daughter; and the other by tram or gharri along the Mena Road  to the Zoological Gardens. This institution is said to have been one of  the many extravagances of the Khedive Ismail. The visitors greatly  admired the grounds and also the fine collection of the larger African  animals.    Driving back in the evening from the Gardens, the soldier was able to  see Cairo taking the air under the shade of the lebbok trees and observe  the wealthy and official classes in their carriages and motors. He was  not slow to notice the arrogant air of the Egyptian male aristocracy,  accompanied as they often were by rather fleshy ladies of foreign  origin. Nor did he fail to feel impressed by the neat and wholesome  appearance of the few British ladies who took exercise on this highway.    With the exception of two days at the beginning of August, when Cairo  was placed out of bounds owing to the rioting, and the 12th to 14th  August, when the Festival of Bairam was being observed, sight-seeing  went on at leave periods during the whole of the Battalion's stay in  Egypt.    On the 16th August the Battalion, when carrying out a night operation in  the desert, was recalled to camp and ordered to proceed the following  morning to garrison the Citadel. At 7.30 a.m. on the 17th August the  28th, leaving the transport behind under a small guard, commenced the  march to its new home which, after a trying time in the heat, was  reached in due course and quarters found in the various blocks of  barracks. These quarters, it was discovered, were alive with vermin,  necessitating the whole Battalion being set to work for several hours in  an attempt to clean the place. Iron bedsteads and palliasses were  available for the use of the troops, but as the palliasses also showed  signs of life very few were used. After Gallipoli was reached an account  for 40 of these iron bedsteads, which the unit, it was inferred, had  taken with it or disposed of in some other unlawful manner, was received  from the British authorities. Needless to say it has not yet been paid.    The C.O. was, for the time being, the Commandant of the fortress which  was the home of the ordnance stores and reserve of ammunition of the  Army of Occupation. Besides the British and Egyptian staffs to work  these, there were other troops within the walls. These included details  of the 2nd Mounted Division, recently embarked for the Peninsula;  British and Indian General Hospitals (both full); a hospital for  convalescents; a detention barracks; and about 40 Turkish Officers under  guard as prisoners of war. Amongst these prisoners was a major, a nephew  of the Senussi, who had been visiting Constantinople at the outbreak of  war and found himself immediately requisitioned for a tour through  Arabia for the purpose of promoting a holy war against the English.  Himself an Arab, who had always looked upon Great Britain with friendly  eyes, he undertook the mission rather unwillingly. In course of time he  joined Djemal Pasha's army approaching the Canal and was finally  captured by its defenders.    Owing to the large numbers of men required for special duties, all  training, except that for the section, platoon, and company, had to  cease. What little was done was carried out in the barrack yards or  else, in the early morning, on the top of the adjacent Moqattam Hills,  which was reached by a kind of causeway running up through the quarries.  The duties consisted of providing guards and sentries for the various  gates of the Citadel; guards on some of the hospitals and detention  barracks; and patrols which had the unpleasant duty of traversing the  highways of the city for the purpose of preserving order and looking  after the interests of the army and the men on leave.    Existing orders did not permit any civilian to enter the gates of the  Citadel unless provided with an official pass. The enforcement of this  order caused some dismay amongst the women from the neighbouring houses  who had been in the habit of visiting the Citadel stables for the  purpose of obtaining material for the manufacture of fuel, which was a  scarce commodity with them. The ladies' method of explaining their  mission was clear, if not delicate, and brought a blush to the faces of  the sentries on the Moqattam Gate.    The Warrant and Non-commissioned Officers had a good mess, which was  presided over by the Regimental Sergeant-Major. The Officers joined and  took over control of the Garrison Officers' Mess--very well and cheaply  run. Here many pleasant acquaintances were made and a good deal learned  in regard to the organisation and working of the British units.    Short leave was still granted liberally to those desiring it, but  numbers found sufficient attraction in or near the Citadel to pass away  many hours. The views from the walls, or from the tops of the old  towers, the mosques, the well and its echo, the remains of Saladin's  palace, the Church of England chapel (established in the bathroom of a  former Sultan's harem), where service was frequently held, all received  much attention. Occasional trips by souvenir hunters were made to the  adjacent \"Dead City.\" These were sometimes fruitful, for in one barrack  room an ancient skull was observed reposing on a shelf above an inmate's  bed.    Now and then concerts were given for the benefit of the hospital  patients, and an invitation for members of the Battalion to attend was  received.    [Illustration: THE CITADEL.  As seen from the Moqattam Hills. Cairo and the Nile in the distance.  _Photo. by Sergt. Arundel._]    On Sunday, 29th August, a visit was received from a party of Western  Australians who were friends and relatives of some members of the  28th, and were making a short stay in Egypt. The party included the Rev.  E. M. Collick, Archdeacon of Kalgoorlie; Mrs. Campbell Wilson; Mrs. and  Miss Montgomery; and Mrs. Makeham.    About the middle of August news of the heavy fighting, which had been  going on at the Dardanelles, began to dribble through. It was gathered  that the results had not been entirely such as could have been hoped  for, and that the casualties--particularly of the 10th Light Horse, the  11th and 16th Battalions--had been heavy. Information was also received  of a disaster to the Yeomanry on the 21st August.    Hospital trains began to arrive and discharge large numbers of wounded  into the hospitals. From the less seriously injured some idea of the  last advance was obtained, and it seemed evident that the 2nd Australian  Division would soon be called upon to play its part. In the third week  of the month the 5th Brigade marched off _en route_ to the front, and  was followed a few days later by the 6th Brigade.    These indications caused some stir in the Battalion and, although  definite orders had not been received, preparations for another move  were commenced.    On the 24th August were issued the colour patches which were to be worn  sewn on to the upper"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25447"],[0,"Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays (#14)"],[1,"fact, and in the application of its results to the world  in time and space, its certainty and precision are lost among  approximations and working hypotheses. The objects considered by  mathematicians have, in the past, been mainly of a kind suggested by  phenomena; but from such restrictions the abstract imagination should  be wholly free. A reciprocal liberty must thus be accorded: reason  cannot dictate to the world of facts, but the facts cannot restrict  reason's privilege of dealing with whatever objects its love of beauty  may cause to seem worthy of consideration. Here, as elsewhere, we  build up our own ideals out of the fragments to be found in the world;  and in the end it is hard to say whether the result is a creation or a  discovery.    It is very desirable, in instruction, not merely to persuade the  student of the accuracy of important theorems, but to persuade him in  the way which itself has, of all possible ways, the most beauty. The  true interest of a demonstration is not, as traditional modes of  exposition suggest, concentrated wholly in the result; where this does  occur, it must be viewed as a defect, to be remedied, if possible, by  so generalising the steps of the proof that each becomes important in  and for itself. An argument which serves only to prove a conclusion is  like a story subordinated to some moral which it is meant to teach:  for æsthetic perfection no part of the whole should be merely a means.  A certain practical spirit, a desire for rapid progress, for conquest  of new realms, is responsible for the undue emphasis upon results  which prevails in mathematical instruction. The better way is to  propose some theme for consideration--in geometry, a figure having  important properties; in analysis, a function of which the study is  illuminating, and so on. Whenever proofs depend upon some only of the  marks by which we define the object to be studied, these marks should  be isolated and investigated on their own account. For it is a defect,  in an argument, to employ more premisses than the conclusion demands:  what mathematicians call elegance results from employing only the  essential principles in virtue of which the thesis is true. It is a  merit in Euclid that he advances as far as he is able to go without  employing the axiom of parallels--not, as is often said, because this  axiom is inherently objectionable, but because, in mathematics, every  new axiom diminishes the generality of the resulting theorems, and the  greatest possible generality is before all things to be sought.    Of the effects of mathematics outside its own sphere more has been  written than on the subject of its own proper ideal. The effect upon  philosophy has, in the past, been most notable, but most varied; in  the seventeenth century, idealism and rationalism, in the eighteenth,  materialism and sensationalism, seemed equally its offspring. Of the  effect which it is likely to have in the future it would be very rash  to say much; but in one respect a good result appears probable.  Against that kind of scepticism which abandons the pursuit of ideals  because the road is arduous and the goal not certainly attainable,  mathematics, within its own sphere, is a complete answer. Too often it  is said that there is no absolute truth, but only opinion and private  judgment; that each of us is conditioned, in his view of the world, by  his own peculiarities, his own taste and bias; that there is no  external kingdom of truth to which, by patience and discipline, we may  at last obtain admittance, but only truth for me, for you, for every  separate person. By this habit of mind one of the chief ends of human  effort is denied, and the supreme virtue of candour, of fearless  acknowledgment of what is, disappears from our moral vision. Of such  scepticism mathematics is a perpetual reproof; for its edifice of  truths stands unshakable and inexpungable to all the weapons of  doubting cynicism.    The effects of mathematics upon practical life, though they should not  be regarded as the motive of our studies, may be used to answer a  doubt to which the solitary student must always be liable. In a world  so full of evil and suffering, retirement into the cloister of  contemplation, to the enjoyment of delights which, however noble, must  always be for the few only, cannot but appear as a somewhat selfish  refusal to share the burden imposed upon others by accidents in which  justice plays no part. Have any of us the right, we ask, to withdraw  from present evils, to leave our fellow-men unaided, while we live a  life which, though arduous and austere, is yet plainly good in its own  nature? When these questions arise, the true answer is, no doubt, that  some must keep alive the sacred fire, some must preserve, in every  generation, the haunting vision which shadows forth the goal of so  much striving. But when, as must sometimes occur, this answer seems  too cold, when we are almost maddened by the spectacle of sorrows to  which we bring no help, then we may reflect that indirectly the  mathematician often does more for human happiness than any of his more  practically active contemporaries. The history of science abundantly  proves that a body of abstract propositions--even if, as in the case  of conic sections, it remains two thousand years without effect upon  daily life--may yet, at any moment, be used to cause a revolution in  the habitual thoughts and occupations of every citizen. The use of  steam and electricity--to take striking instances--is rendered  possible only by mathematics. In the results of abstract thought the  world possesses a capital of which the employment in enriching the  common round has no hitherto discoverable limits. Nor does experience  give any means of deciding what parts of mathematics will be found  useful. Utility, therefore, can be only a consolation in moments of  discouragement, not a guide in directing our studies.    For the health of the moral life, for ennobling the tone of an age or  a nation, the austerer virtues have a strange power, exceeding the  power of those not informed and purified by thought. Of these austerer  virtues the love of truth is the chief, and in mathematics, more than  elsewhere, the love of truth may find encouragement for waning faith.  Every great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of  creating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind; and this purpose should  be kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of  mathematics.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] This passage was pointed out to me by Professor Gilbert Murray.          V    MATHEMATICS AND THE METAPHYSICIANS      The nineteenth century, which prided itself upon the invention of  steam and evolution, might have derived a more legitimate title to  fame from the discovery of pure mathematics. This science, like most  others, was baptised long before it was born; and thus we find writers  before the nineteenth century alluding to what they called pure  mathematics. But if they had been asked what this subject was, they  would only have been able to say that it consisted of Arithmetic,  Algebra, Geometry, and so on. As to what these studies had in common,  and as to what distinguished them from applied mathematics, our  ancestors were completely in the dark.    Pure mathematics was discovered by Boole, in a work which he called  the _Laws of Thought_ (1854). This work abounds in asseverations that  it is not mathematical, the fact being that Boole was too modest to  suppose his book the first ever written on mathematics. He was also  mistaken in supposing that he was dealing with the laws of thought:  the question how people actually think was quite irrelevant to him,  and if his book had really contained the laws of thought, it was  curious that no one should ever have thought in such a way before. His  book was in fact concerned with formal logic, and this is the same  thing as mathematics.    Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that,  if such and such a proposition is true of _anything_, then such and  such another proposition is true of that thing. It is essential not to  discuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to  mention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true. Both  these points would belong to applied mathematics. We start, in pure  mathematics, from certain rules of inference, by which we can infer  that _if_ one proposition is true, then so is some other proposition.  These rules of inference constitute the major part of the principles  of formal logic. We then take any hypothesis that seems amusing, and  deduce its consequences. _If_ our hypothesis is about _anything_, and  not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions  constitute mathematics. Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject  in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we  are saying is true. People who have been puzzled by the beginnings of  mathematics will, I hope, find comfort in this definition, and will  probably agree that it is accurate.    As one of the chief triumphs of modern mathematics consists in having  discovered what mathematics really is, a few more words on this  subject may not be amiss. It is common to start any branch of  mathematics--for instance, Geometry--with a certain number of  primitive ideas, supposed incapable of definition, and a certain  number of primitive propositions or axioms, supposed incapable of  proof. Now the fact is that, though there are indefinables and  indemonstrables in every branch of applied mathematics, there are none  in pure mathematics except such as belong to general logic. Logic,  broadly speaking, is distinguished by the fact that its propositions  can be put into a form in which they apply to anything whatever. All  pure mathematics--Arithmetic, Analysis, and Geometry--is built up by  combinations of the primitive ideas of"]]]
