Can  I count upon that help?\"    \"Yes, my lady, to a man,\" cried the old servant, eagerly.    \"I thought so,\" said Lady Royland, smiling proudly.  \"You will go, then,  Roy, and see what Martlet is to do.\"    Roy was already at the door, and five minutes later he was standing in  the gate-way with every man employed about the place, the three troopers  being fast asleep, exhausted by their long journey down from town.        CHAPTER NINE.    PORTCULLIS AND BRIDGE.    As Roy appeared, there was a low buzz of voices, and directly after the  butler cried, \"Three cheers for the young master!\" with a hearty result.    Just then Ben came close up to say, confidentially--    \"I made it all comfortable with poor old Jenk, sir.\"    \"That's right; and Sam Rogers?\"    \"Proud's a dog with two tails, sir.  Now, sir, if you'll give the  orders, we'll go up and see what can be done about making the place  safe, and I'm afraid we're going to have a job.\"    Roy felt a slight sensation of shrinking, but he mastered it, and  calling to the men to follow him, he turned in by the low arched  door-way, and ascended to the first chamber of the gate tower, to pause  where the great iron grating hung before him in its stone grooves formed  in the wall, and with its spikes descending through the slit on the  floor, below which the stone paving of the entrance could be seen.    To make sure of its not descending by any accident of the chains giving,  three massive pieces of squared oak had been thrust through as many of  the openings at the bottom, so that the portcullis rested upon them as  these crossed the long narrow slit through which it descended, and a  little examination showed that if the chains were tightened by turning  the two capstans by means of the bars, and the chains drawn a little  over the great wheels fixed in the ceiling, it would be easy enough to  withdraw the three supports and let the grating down.    \"Chains look terribly rusty,\" said Roy.  \"Think they'll bear it, Ben?\"    \"They're rusty, sir, and a good deal eaten away; but they used to put  good work into these sort o' things, because if they hadn't, they'd have  come down and killed some one.  Shall we try?\"    \"Yes; no one can be hurt if a watch is kept below.  Go down, one of you,  and see that no one passes under.\"    One of the men ran down, the old capstan-bars were taken from the  corners, and two men on each side inserted them into the holes, and  waited for the order to tighten the chains round the rollers.    \"Ready?  All together!\" cried Roy; and the men pulled the bars towards  them with a will, the chains tightened, the pulleys creaked and groaned,  and the grating rose an inch or two, sufficient for the pieces of oak  crossing the narrow slit to have been drawn out, when _crack_--_crack_--  two of the bars the men handled snapped short off, and their holders  fell, while the portcullis sank back to its old place with a heavy jar.    \"Hundred years, perhaps, since they've been used,\" said Roy.  \"Any one  hurt?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the men, laughing in spite of a bruise or two; and the  bars being examined, it was found that the tough oak of which they were  composed was completely honeycombed by worms, and powdered away to dust.    \"First job, then, sir, to make new bars,\" said Ben, promptly.    \"Yes; we'll have the carpenters in from the village directly, Ben.  With  these pulleys well greased, I suppose this will work.\"    \"Ay, sir, no doubt about that; it's the drawbridge I'm afraid of,\" said  Ben.    \"Let's go up and see, then.\"    Roy led the way again, and the men followed into the dark chamber above,  where the old furnace stood, and in the corners on either side of the  narrow window, with its hollowed-out notches for firing or using  cross-bows from, were two great round chimney-like constructions built  in the stone, up and down which huge weights, which depended from  massive chains and passed over great rollers, had formerly been used to  glide.    Ben shook his head as he put his hand upon one of the weights, which  were formed of so many discs of cast lead, through the centre of which  the great chain passed, a solid bar of iron being driven through a link  below to keep them from sliding off.    The weights hung about breast-high; and at the slight pressure of the  man's hand began to swing to and fro in the stone place open to the  chamber, but closed below where they ran down in the wall at the sides  of the gate-way.    \"Well, these must have been worked by hand, Ben,\" said Roy.  \"Men must  have stood here and run them down.  Two of you go to the other side, and  all press down together, but stand ready to jump back in case anything  breaks.  I don't see how you can be hurt if you do.\"    \"No, sir; no one can't be hurt, for the weights will only go down these  holes with a bang.\"    \"Try, then.  Now, all together--pull!\"    The men tugged and strained, but there was no sign of yielding, and Ben  shook his head.    \"Rollers must be rusted, sir, and stick.\"    But upon his climbing up to examine them, it proved that these had not  been made to turn, only for the chains to slide over them, as the  grooves worn in the iron showed.    \"Nothing to stop 'em here, sir,\" said the man.    \"Then it must be set fast at the end of the bridge,\" said Roy; and,  descending with the men, they crossed the moat and found the bridge  completely wedged and fixed in the opening of stone which embraced the  end.    Picks and crowbars were fetched, the stones and sand scraped out, and  when the place was cleared they reascended to the furnace-chamber, when,  upon another trial being made, it was found that the weights so  accurately balanced the bridge that with very little exertion the chains  came screeching and groaning over the iron rollers, and the men gave a  cheer as the end rose up and up till it was drawn very nearly up to the  face of the tower.    Ben rubbed his ear and grinned with satisfaction.    \"Come, sir,\" he said, \"we can make ourselves pretty safe that way; but  I'm afraid the moat's so filled up that a man can wade across.\"    \"That he can't,\" cried one of the gardeners.  \"I've plumbed it all over,  and there aren't a place less nor seven or eight feet deep, without  counting the mud.\"    \"Then you've been fishing!\" thought Roy, but he did not say so, only  gave orders for the bridge to be lowered again, and sent a man for a  supply of grease to well lubricate the rollers and chains.    Down went the bridge, in a most unmusical way, and as soon as it was in  its place once more, a man was sent across for the village carpenter to  come with his tools, there being plenty of good seasoned oak-wood stored  up in the buildings.    Then a consultation ensued.  They had the means of cutting themselves  off from the outer world, and in a short time the portcullis would add  to the strength of their defences.    \"What's next, Ben?\" said Roy.    \"I'm a-thinking, sir.  We've done a lot already, but there's so much  more to do that things get a bit jumbled like in my head.  We've got to  get our garrison, and then there's two very important things--wittles  and water!\"    \"The well supplies that last,\" said Roy; \"and if we were running short,  we could use the water from the moat for everything but food.\"    \"Yes, sir, that's good.  Cart must go to the mill, and bring all the  corn and flour that can be got.  Then we must have some beasts and sheep  from the farm.\"    \"That's bad,\" said Roy, \"because they'll want feeding.\"    \"Have to be driven out every morning, sir, till we're besieged.  Must  have some cows in too, so that if we are beset we can be independent.  But first of all, sir, we ought to see to the powder and the guns.  But  you and me must see to the powder ourselves.  We shall want some help  over the guns, and I'm thinking as you'd best make that carpenter stay.  The wheels are off one or two of the gun-carriages, and there's no  rammers or sponges; and I shouldn't wonder if the carriages as I painted  over and pitched are only so many worm-eaten shells.\"    \"Well, all these things will have to be got over by degrees, Ben.  We  have done the first great things towards making the castle safe, and an  enemy need not know how unprepared we are.\"    \"I don't know so much about being safe, sir.\"    \"What, not with the drawbridge up?\"    \"No, sir,\" said Ben, in a low tone.  \"But suppose you sends the men to  dinner now, and orders 'em to meet in a hour's time in the court-yard--  oh dear, oh dear! that's all garden now.\"    \"You can make room for the men to meet without disturbing the garden,\"  said Roy, sharply.    \"Very well, sir; you're master.  Will you give your orders?\"    Roy gave them promptly, and the men walked away.    \"Now, then,\" said Roy, \"what did you mean about the place not being  safe?  With the bridge up, they could only cross to us by rafts or  boats, and then they couldn't get in.\"    \"Well, sir, it's like this.  I've heard tell, though I'd forgotten all  about it till just now, as there's a sort o' passage goes out from the  dungeons under the nor'-west tower over to the little ruins on the hill  over yonder.\"    \"Impossible!  Why, it would have to be half a mile long, Ben.\"    \"All that, sir.\"    \"But it couldn't go under the moat.  It would be full of water.\"    \"Nay, not if it was made tight, sir.\"    \"But what makes you say that?  You've never seen the passage?\"    \"No, sir, I've never been down, but your father once said something  about it.  It was a long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25452"],[0,"The Kangaroo Marines (#14)"],[1,"and.  Luck  favoured him.  A random shot is nothing in war.  Finding a hole near  by, he dumped the body in, then covered it over with grass.  This done,  he whipped out his glasses and commenced to study things.  Away in  front he could see the convoys slowly moving past.  There were guns,  ammunition wagons, water-carts, ration wagons, and streams of men.  This was not the usual reliefs and supplies.  There was something  doing.  The troops were new, their equipment was good, their bearing  fresh and alert.  All this was very interesting; but Tony was not near  enough to get what he wanted.  He decided to walk right through the  lines.  Leaving his rifle and placing his revolver and glasses in the  Turkish haversack, he set off.  He was soon one of the many straggling  Turkish troops on various errands.  They hailed him in their oriental  way, but Tony simply grunted in reply.    That is a way of the East, so all went well.  At last the daring  officer was close behind the Turkish lines.  He stumbled on the  batteries well placed and well hid.  Stacks of shells lay to hand in  preparation for their attack.  In another part he located a  searchlight, and down in a little gully he found a forward base for gun  and rifle ammunition.  This was a sound discovery.  He memorised the  spot and tried to locate it on the map.  Passing on, he came to a field  hospital.  This was being cleared, for wagons were taking the wounded  men away to the ships which lay in the offing.  When a hospital is  being cleared, look out for a fight.  A soldier understands what it  means.    Tony finally arrived in a sort of rest camp.  It was alive with  men--fresh ones from Constantinople.  There were plenty of German  officers, too, also some sailors with _Goeben_ and _Breslau_ on their  caps.  He wondered what the sailors were there for.  They seemed to be  camped round an artillery park.  He solved it; they were serving the  guns.  Down the lines he stumbled, grunting like an old horse, and,  occasionally, sitting down to view the scene.  They had plenty of  biscuits, and even such luxuries as coffee, bread, and water melons.  No signs of starvation or lack of supplies.  That was an important  point.  Tony was doing well.  His scheme was succeeding beyond his  dreams.  Indeed, he was beginning to feel quite cocky, till, on looking  round, he found a swarthy little fellow behind him.  He was being  followed.  Something gripped his heart.  He had shot his bolt.  Still  he did not lose his head.  This little man must be led on a little  farther.  Tony retraced his steps.  The man followed him.  He sat down;  the Turk also sat down.  This was unnerving, and the young sub. almost  shouted in anger and agony.  Rising again, he went on, striking into  the open and less populated part.  And, all the while, the officer  wondered how he was going to deal with his sleuth-hound.  He could not  shoot him there.    At last his eye caught sight of the little knoll where his dead Turk  lay buried.  Good!  He would lead him up there.  He plodded on, and,  behind him, stalked the patient-looking Turk.  Oh! the agony of those  moments.  It was like a knife sinking by degrees into the human heart.  It was the hour for nerve, coolness and caution.  Tony reached the top  of the hill.  With a sigh he sat down, pulled out his pipe and  commenced to smoke.  The Turk also sat down, but at the foot of the  hill.  He too started to smoke.  His face had the sense of ease, his  eyes a humorous gleam.  He, apparently, was in no hurry.  What the  devil did he mean?  Tony wondered, and wondered.  This torture was  insufferable; so insufferable that the subaltern waved his arm,  signalling the Turk to come up beside him.  He obeyed.  As he reached  the top he took off his cap and said, \"Good days, Mr. Ingleesman.\"    \"Who's English?\" said Tony, smiling at his own audacity and apparent  admission.    \"You very Inglees--you smokit pipe, your boots, your walk.  I plenty  savvy,\" he said, tapping his head.  \"I no seely Turk.  Me Syrian.\"    \"What the devil are you doing here?\"    \"They maket me fight.  I no' wants fight.  Me Christian.  I likes  Inglees.\"    \"But what are you following me for?\"    \"Well--monees--backsheesh.  Me poor man.\"    \"How did you spot me?\"    \"You droppit this when you down there,\" said the Syrian, pulling an  identity disc out of his pocket.  This was stamped, \"Lieut. Tony Brown,  New Zealand Dragoons.\"  The subaltern paled as he looked at this  damning proof.  He must have dropped it when fumbling with his pockets  in the camp below.    He inwardly cursed his stupidity.    \"Have a cigarette?\" said he, offering a Virginian to his new-found  friend.    \"Oh, wery nice--wery Inglees _too_,\" said the Syrian, looking at the  inscription: \"Three Castles.  W. D. & H. O. Wills.\"  \"No maket these in  Stamboul--eh?\"    \"Not till we get there,\" said Tony with a yawn, at the same time  measuring the distance between his man and debating whether it would be  better to kill him or capture him and then take him back in the boat.    Meanwhile the Syrian was smoking airily, almost casually.   He was a  born scoundrel.  Intrigue was his game.  This Syrian had Mammon all  over his body and soul.  Good gold could buy him any time.    \"You spy?\" he said, looking up at Tony in a casual yet cunning way.  The word \"spy\" was a dagger into the subaltern's nerves and heart.  It  left him breathless for a moment.  Recovering his wits, he airily  answered, \"Well----\"    \"Me poor man--me tell you things.  How much?\"    \"Fifty pounds--eh?\"    \"One hundreds--it worth it--good beesness.  Me plenty savvy--me know.\"    \"What?\"    \"Plentee news 'bout guns, men and--beeg attacks----\"    \"Oh!\" said Tony, startled out of his casual way.  The Syrian smiled.  He had divined his quest.    \"Tell me then.\"    \"Monees,\" said the Syrian, holding out his hand.  The ways of the East  are, at least, direct.    \"There you are,\" said the subaltern, handing him ten crisp Bank of  England notes.  He had come prepared for this contingency.    \"When is the attack, now?\"    \"Friday mornings early.\"    \"The exact time I want.\"    \"Half past fours.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"I orderleys and interpreeters to arteelery's staff.\"    \"Oh!  Now, isn't there a battery down there?\" said Tony, pointing to a  piece of rising ground which he had passed over.    \"No--one batterees there,\" said the Syrian, directing his eyes to the  exact place where Tony had discovered the first battery.    \"Good!\" muttered the New Zealander.  He knew he was telling the truth.  Pulling out a pocket-book, he made a rough sketch of the ground round  about, and then cross-examined the Syrian.  Batteries, magazines,  stores, trenches, headquarters, beaches, water and food supplies were  all duly noted and placed on the map.  Tony Brown, at one scoop, had  entered the highest realms of the Intelligence Service.  It was dusk  when he had finished.    \"Me go now,\" said the Syrian, rising.    \"No you won't.  You'll come with me and guide the way.\"    \"But I geeves you informations, what more?\"    \"Look here, old cock, I believe you, but you're a Syrian.\"    \"Syrian good man,\" protested the informer.    \"Sometimes.  Hands up!\" said Tony, cocking his revolver suddenly.    \"No' keels me--no' keels me!\"    \"I won't if you keep quiet.  Now, push ahead--that way,\" said Tony,  directing him on the return route.  The Syrian cursed and mumbled in  his own fiery way as he stumbled down the hill.  He was annoyed.    \"Here--look at this,\" said Tony, calling him back.  The New Zealander  bent down, and, uncovering the body of the dead Turk, showed it to him.    \"Uh!\" shuddered the man.    \"Now, keep quiet,\" ordered the officer, pushing him down the hill.  Stealthily they went, avoiding dug-outs, tents, and other hives of the  Turkish army.  For hours they seemed to walk.  Something was wrong.    \"Stop!\" said Tony suddenly.  Instinct suggested danger.  He had been  led astray.  Pulling out a compass, he fixed it.  The direction was  wrong.  This Syrian was playing his own game.  He wanted another  hundred pounds for this officer's body.  It was worth more than that to  the Turkish army.  And he knew it.  War breeds parasites and rogues.    \"You scoundrel!\" said Tony, springing at the Syrian's throat.  The  latter fought, kicked, and bit like a tiger.  To have shot him would  have been madness, for they were now back in the centre of the Turkish  lines.  Placing his great hands round the man's throat, Tony slowly  choked him into a state of collapse.  Another knock on his head with  the butt of the revolver placed him in such a condition that he would  be unable to recollect his thoughts for many days.  That was all the  subaltern desired.  He left him.  Taking a compass bearing again, he  struck out towards the beach.  Luck favoured him almost till the end.  As he neared the top of the cliff which guarded the beach his foot  slipped, and he fell into a dug-out, right on the top of three Turkish  soldiers.  Curses were mixed with shouts of \"Allah!\"  Then questions  were asked.  But Tony could answer none.  A little flashlamp next shone  in his face.  He was discovered.    \"Inglees!  Inglees!\" exclaimed a Turk.  The other two started and  chattered volubly.  One lifted a rifle to finish him off, but the man  with the lamp stopped him.  He knew his job.  He wanted to know what  this man was doing there.  Tony was searched, and the map discovered  secreted down the leg of his stocking.  His heart quailed.  He seemed  doomed.  He had been so near success; now he seemed so far.  He  inwardly shuddered at the prospect ahead.  It would be death, and death  of a cruel and unrefined kind.  Oh, the mental horror of that moment.  It was worse than a bayonet in the stomach, and that is bad enough.  He  longed for death--death, sure and sharp.  But it did not come.  He was  seized and bound, then thrown into a corner to await the dawn, when  this coast patrol"]]]
