One day the Drac gave her an eel pasty to eat. Her fingers  became greasy with the fat; and she happened to put them to one of her  eyes. Forthwith she acquired a clear and distinct vision under the  water. After some years she was allowed to return to her husband and  family; and going early one morning to the market-place of Beaucaire,  she met the Drac. Recognizing him at once, she saluted him and asked  after the health of his wife and child. \"With which eye do you see me?\"  inquired the Drac. The woman pointed to the eye she had touched with the  eel-fat; and thrusting his finger into it, the Drac vanished from  sight.[37]    The only punishment suffered in these cases is the deprivation of the  power of seeing fairies, or banishment from their society. This seems  mild enough: much more was generally inflicted. The story first quoted  relates what seems to be the ordinary form of vengeance for disregard of  the prohibition to use the fairy eye-salve, namely, loss of sight in the  offending eye. Spitting or striking is usually the means adopted by the  elves to effect this end. Sometimes, however, the eye is torn from its  socket. Whether there is much to choose between these different ways of  undergoing the punishment is doubtful; but it should be noted that the  last-mentioned mode is a favourite one in Brittany, and follows not so  much on recognition as on denunciation by the virtuous mortal of the  elf's thieving propensities. \"See what thieves these fairies are!\" cried  a woman who watched one of them putting her hand into the pocket of a  country woman's apron. The fairy instantly turned round and tore out her  eye. \"Thieves!\" bawled another on a similar occasion, with the same  result. In a Cornish tale a woman is entrusted in her own house with the  care of an elf-child. The child brought remarkable prosperity to the  house, and his foster-mother grew very fond of him. Finding that a  certain water in which she was required to wash his face made it very  bright, she determined to try it on her own, and splashed some of it  into her eye. This conferred the gift of seeing the little people, who  played with her boy, but had hitherto been invisible to her; and one day  she was surprised to meet her nursling's father in the market--stealing.  Recognition followed, and the stranger exclaimed:        \"Water for elf, not water for self,      You've lost your eye, your child, and yourself.\"    From that hour she was blind in the right eye. When she got home the boy  was gone; and she and her husband, who had once been so happy, became  poor and wretched.[38]    Here poverty and wretchedness, as well as the loss of an eye, were  inflicted. In a Northumbrian case the foster-parent lost his charge and  both eyes. So in a story from Guernsey, the midwife, on the Saturday  following her attendance on the lady, meets the husband and father in a  shop filling his basket to right and left. She at once comprehends the  plenty that reigned in his mysterious dwelling. \"Ah, you wicked thief, I  see you!\" she cried. \"You see me; how?\" he inquired. \"With my eyes,\" she  replied. \"In that case I will soon put you out of power to play the  spy,\" he answered. So saying, he spat in her face, and she became blind  on the spot. A Danish story also relates that a midwife, who had  inadvertently anointed her eyes with the salve handed to her by the  elf-folk for the usual purpose, was going home afterwards and passed by  a rye-field. The field was swarming with elves, who were busy clipping  off the ears of rye. Indignantly she cried out: \"What are you doing  there?\" The little people thronged round her, and angrily answered: \"If  thou canst see us, thus shalt thou be served;\" and suiting the action to  the word, they put out her eyes.[39]    Human beings, however, betray their meddling with fairy ointment in  other ways than by speech. The following curious story was related as  current at his native place, by Dr. Carre of St. Jacut-de-la-Mer, to M.  Sebillot. A fisherman from St. Jacut was the last to return one evening  at dusk from the scene of his labours; and as he walked along the wet  sand of the seashore, he suddenly came upon a number of sea-fairies in a  cavern, talking and gesticulating with vivacity, though he could not  hear what they said. He beheld them rub their eyes and bodies with a  sort of pomade, when, lo! their appearance changed, and they were  enabled to walk away in the guise of ordinary women. Hiding carefully  behind a large rock, he watched them out of sight; and then, impelled by  curiosity, he made straight for the cave. There he found what was left  of the pomade, and taking a little on his finger, he smeared it around  his left eye. By this means he found himself able to penetrate the  various disguises assumed by the fairies for the purpose of robbing or  annoying mankind. He recognized as one of that mischievous race a  beggar-woman whom he saw a few days afterwards going from door to door  demanding charity. He saw her casting spells on certain houses, and  peering eagerly into all, as if she were seeking for something to steal.  He distinguished, too, when out in his boat, fish which were real fish  from fish which were in reality \"ladies of the sea,\" employed in  entangling the nets and playing other tricks upon the seamen. Attending  the fair of Ploubalay, he saw several elves who had assumed the shapes  of fortune-tellers, showmen, or gamblers, to deceive the country folk;  and this permitted him to keep clear of their temptations. But as he  smiled to himself at what was going on around him, some of the elves,  who were exhibiting themselves on a platform in front of one of the  booths, caught sight of him; and he saw by the anger in their looks that  they had divined his secret. Before he had time to fly, one of them,  with the rapidity of an arrow, struck his clairvoyant eye with a stick  and burst it. That is what happened to him who would learn the secrets  of the sea-fairies.[40]    Such was the punishment of curiosity; nor is it by fairies alone that  curiosity is punished. Cranmere Pool on Dartmoor is, we are told, a  great penal settlement for refractory spirits. Many of the former  inhabitants of the parish are supposed to be still there expiating their  ghostly pranks. Of the spirit of one old farmer it is related that it  took seven clergymen to secure him. They, however, succeeded at last in  transforming him into a colt, which was given in charge to a servant-boy  with directions to take him to Cranmere Pool, and there on the brink of  the pool to slip off the halter and return instantly without looking  round. He did look round, in spite of the warning, and beheld the colt  in the form of a ball of fire plunge into the water. But as the  mysterious beast plunged he gave the lad a parting kick, which knocked  out one of his eyes, just as the Calender was deprived of his eye in the  \"Arabian Nights.\" Still worse was the fate that overtook a woman, who,  at midnight on New Year's Eve, when all water is turned into wine, was  foolhardy enough to go to a well. As she bent over it to draw, one came  and plucked out her eye, saying:        \"All water is wine,      And thy two eyes are mine.\"    A variant of the story relates that the woman herself disappeared, and  gives the rhyme as        \"All water is wine,      And what is thereby is mine.\"[41]    At the end of the last chapter we noted as a characteristic of fairy  nature the objection to be recognized and addressed by men who are  privileged to see them. We are now able to carry the generalization a  step further. For, from the instances adduced in the foregoing pages, it  is obviously a common belief that supernatural personages, without  distinction, dislike not merely being recognized and addressed, but even  being seen, or at all events being watched, and are only willing to be  manifested to humanity at their own pleasure and for their own purposes.  In the stories of the Magical Ointment it is not so much the theft as  the contravention of the implicit prohibition against prying into fairy  business that rouses elfin anger. This will appear more clearly from the  fuller consideration of cases like those mentioned in the last  paragraph, in which punishment follows directly upon the act of spying.  In Northamptonshire, we learn that a man whose house was frequented by  fairies, and who had received many favours from them, became smitten  with a violent desire to behold his invisible benefactors. Accordingly,  he one night stationed himself behind a knot in the door which divided  the living-room of his cottage from the sleeping-apartment. True to  their custom, the elves came to disport themselves on his  carefully-swept hearth, and to render to the household their usual good  offices. But no sooner had the man glanced upon them than he became  blind; and so provoked were the fairies at this breach of hospitality  that they deserted his dwelling, and never more returned to it. In  Southern Germany and Switzerland, a mysterious lady known as Dame  Berchta is reputed to be abroad on Twelfth Night. She is admittedly the  relic of a heathen goddess, one of whose attributes was to be a leader  of the souls of the dead; and as such she is followed by a band of  children. For her the peasants on Twelfth Night set a repast, of which,  if she be pleased, she and her troop partake. A servant boy at a  peasant's farm in the Tirol on one such occasion perceived Lady  Berchta's approach, and hid himself behind the kneading-trough to watch  what she would do. She immediately became aware of his presence as he  peeped through a chink, and called to one of her children to go and stop  that chink. The child went and blew into it, and the boy became  stark-blind. Thus he continued for a year, nor could any doctor help  him, until an old experienced man advised him to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24616"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Southwark Cathedral (#14)"],[1,"headed and traceried  canopies. Their proximity and close resemblance formerly led to the  conjecture that they were the tombs of the two Norman knights, William  Pont de l'Arche and William Dauncey, who co-operated with Bishop  Giffard in refounding the Priory. If this is the case, the tombs must  have undergone alteration at a later date, as the decoration is in the  Perpendicular style, and much more ornate than that of the recess at  the west end of the same wall, undoubtedly of late Norman, or  Transitional, design. The westernmost of the two, again, has been held  to be the burial-place of Thomas Cure, a local benefactor in the  reigns of Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, who is commemorated by a  tablet within it. The Latin epitaph (1588) is a string of punning  allusions to his name. The most recent theory, and the most probable,  respecting the recesses, is that they mark the tombs of Priors  belonging to the Tudor period. The easternmost now contains the effigy  of a supposed _Crusader_, which, after undergoing many \"translations\"  from its unknown original place to the lumber of the church, and then  to a ridiculous upright position against the north wall, has now found  shelter in the recess which happens to hold it exactly. It is a  remarkably fine piece of oak carving, and represents a knight clad in  chain armour, consisting of a hauberk with sleeves, over which is  thrown a surcoat crossed by two belts, one round the waist for the  sword, the other crossing the body diagonally to hold the shield. The  cross-guard of the sword is of metal, and is probably a reparation.  The head wears a conical helmet, and the feet rest upon a lion. The  legs are crossed at the knees, and the knight is in the act of placing  his sword in the scabbard, both of which details are open to various  interpretations. Conjecture has also been busy as to the person  represented, who is now thought to have been a member of the de Warren  family, several of whom were buried in the church, and the style of  armour, unless a clever imitation, points to the date of Edward I or  Edward II. After having been overlaid with successive coats of paint,  which completely blocked up and concealed the delicate chain-work, the  figure has been more or less redeemed, but not restored to its  original colour. This appears to have been mainly a pale blue, not  unlike the real armour, but it is now coated with bronze.[30]       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     EFFIGY OF MAILED KNIGHT.]       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE TREHEARNE MONUMENT.]    The most conspicuous monument in the aisle is that of =John  Trehearne=, servant to Queen Elizabeth and \"Gentleman Portar\" to  James I. Flanked by two pilasters, carved in the Italian style,  supporting a plainer canopy, the monument consists of three parts:  first a plain base; then a plinth, on the front of which (in  bas-relief) are the four children of the deceased in a kneeling  posture; and, lastly, on the top of the tomb, the kneeling figures of  Trehearne and his wife in the picturesque costume and ruff collars of  the age. The principal figures are holding a tablet between them  inscribed with a eulogistic epitaph in English, the moral of which is  that if Trehearne's royal master could have retained his services, his  heavenward progress would have been considerably delayed. The Vestry  minute for 15th October, 1577 (quoted by Dr. Thompson), shows the  deceased to have been a passive resister in the matter of tithes, for  which he had to pay double in the long run. He died on 22nd October,  1618, and was buried the very next day. His wife died on 22nd January,  1645. She was followed by the eldest son on 22nd of August in the same  year, and they were all buried in the one grave.    A door in the aisle communicates with the =Chapel of St. John the  Divine=, at present used as a clergy vestry. Fortunately it has not  shared the fate of the companion chapel of St. John the Baptist. Up to  a quarter of a century ago it had been turned to account as a  Magistrates' Court, and still retains the Royal Arms over the large  pew erected for the purpose. This, with the iron safe and wooden  cupboards set up against the walls, still gives the chapel some of the  appearance of a Committee room, and helps to conceal some most  interesting architectural features. A shaft had long been visible on  the exterior which was thought to show signs of Saxon workmanship.  This fragment, added to the known fact that the chapel was one of the  oldest parts of the church, if not the oldest of all, has led to a  fuller examination in recent years, revealing the outlines of three  Norman arches in the inner walls, and still more recently the shafts  of a wall-arcade on the eastern side, apparently indicating an apsidal  termination.    Henceforth the chapel will be associated with the name of John  Harvard, who was born in the parish, and baptized in the church on  29th November, 1607, and its restoration is intended to take the form  of a memorial to that great and good man. It is not unlikely, in  fact, that his name will popularly supersede the original dedication  (almost forgotten already) much in the same way as the \"Little Chapel  of our Lady\" was overshadowed by the great name of Bishop Andrewes.    The first practical step in this direction was taken by the Hon.  Joseph H. Choate, who manifested great interest in the ancient fabric  while he was American Ambassador, and presented the east window to the  chapel in commemoration of John Harvard, founder of the renowned  university which bears his name. The window, 'unveiled by Mr. Choate  on Monday, 22nd May, 1905, is of three lights, transomed, as designed  by Sir Arthur Blomfield and Sons, the glass being made in America  under the supervision of Mr. Charles F. McKim, the famous American  architect. The design is by Mr. John La Farge. In the central light of  the lower division the Baptism of Christ is depicted, attendant angels  occupying the sides. The upper division contains the arms of Emmanuel  College, Cambridge, where John Harvard was educated, and of the  Harvard University, with its mottoes, _Veritas_ and _Christo et  Ecclesiae_. The base bears the inscription, \"In memory of John  Harvard, founder of Harvard University in America, baptized in this  church, Nov. 29, 1607.\"       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE HARVARD WINDOW.]    The window is a noteworthy example of modern work, and the treatment  of the familiar subject is distinctly original, in which respect, as  well as in colouring, it presents a very striking contrast to the  other windows, especially to those of mediaeval character, throughout  the church. Perhaps it is fortunate that it occupies an isolated  position in the chapel, where the brilliance and peculiarity of the  colouring are seen to full advantage without detriment to the other  windows.    It is hoped that this generous gift inaugurates the restoration of the  old chapel to its original dignity, as a worthy memorial to him whose  name will henceforth be inseparable from it. The intention is to equip  it with an altar and other necessary fittings for use at early  celebrations and small gatherings of people, at present without  accommodation. A new vestry for the clergy is badly wanted, as well as  for the choir, whose cassocks and surplices now hang in the adjacent  aisle.    The =South Choir Aisle= is lighted by a small lancet above the  entrance porch representing the Good Shepherd; by another lancet to  the memory of John Herd, an inhabitant; and by a window of three  lights. The last commemorates George Gwilt, the distinguished  architect who did so much for the restoration of 1832-3, elsewhere  described.    Two tablets in the same aisle are worth noticing. The first is a  brass, dated 1652, on the pier between the choir and aisle entrance,  in memory of Susanna Barford, who died at the early age of ten years  and thirteen weeks. The inscription quotes her as, \"The Non-such of  the world for Piety and Vertue in soe tender years.\" Below these words  there is an epitaph in rhyming couplets and complimentary terms,  separated from the inscription by a death's head and crossbones, and a  pair of wings supporting an hourglass, on the dexter and sinister  sides respectively. This is the only brass with any approach to  antiquity in the Cathedral, though the matrix of another, evidently  thought more worthy of a private collection, has been detected in one  of the recesses, lately described, in the opposite aisle. The other  memorial is a plain marble slab, scarcely seen in the darkness between  the windows. It commemorates Abraham Newland, the model chief cashier  of the Bank of England, whose strict notions of duty would not allow  him to sleep a single night off the premises during the twenty-five  years of his appointment. He died in 1807, two months after taking his  pension, leaving L60,000, in the funds, to his landlady. This  inexpensive memorial is a token of her gratitude.    The =Organ=.--On the south side of the aisle is the organ-chamber  erected by Sir Arthur Blomfield and Sons, after much discussion as to  a suitable place for the new instrument, for which it was eventually  decided to build the chamber over part of the site once occupied by  the Magdalen Church. The old organ used to stand in the gallery at the  west end of the debased nave, and was since removed to the north  transept. When it was finally taken down it was unsaleable as a  musical instrument, and had to go for what it would fetch as so much  wood and metal. Some relics of it have, however, been preserved in the  shape of the large gilded angels which adorned its front. These are  now stored above the tall iron safe in the Harvard chapel. The present  organ and the chamber which contains it were both presented by the  late Mrs. Robert Courage as a memorial to her husband.    The new organ,"]]]
