[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#14)"],[1,"r.  Fitzgerald's expedition to Aconcagua came to his mind, and he recalled  that, although every other member of the party reached the summit, that  gentleman himself was unable to do so. In the last stage the difficulty  of breathing had increased with fits of smothering, and the medicine  chest held no remedy for blind staggers.          CHAPTER V    THE ULTIMATE HEIGHT      We lay down for a few hours on the night of the 6th June, resolved to  rise at three in the morning for our attempt upon the summit of Denali.  At supper Walter had made a desperate effort to use some of our ten  pounds of flour in the manufacture of \"noodles\" with which to thicken  the stew. We had continued to pack that flour and had made effort after  effort to cook it in some eatable way, but without success. The sour  dough would not ferment, and we had no baking-powder. _Is_ there any way  to cook flour under such circumstances? But he made the noodles too  large and did not cook them enough, and they wrought internal havoc upon  those who partook of them. Three of the four of us were unwell all  night. The digestion is certainly more delicate and more easily  disturbed at great altitudes than at the lower levels. While Karstens  and Tatum were tossing uneasily in the bedclothes, the writer sat up  with a blanket round his shoulders, crouching over the primus stove,  with the thermometer at -21 deg. F. outdoors. Walter alone was at ease,  with digestive and somnolent capabilities proof against any invasion. It  was, of course, broad daylight all night. At three the company was  aroused, and, after partaking of a very light breakfast indeed, we  sallied forth into the brilliant, clear morning with not a cloud in the  sky. The only packs we carried that day were the instruments and the  lunch. The sun was shining, but a keen north wind was blowing and the  thermometer stood at -4 deg. F. We were rather a sorry company. Karstens  still had internal pains; Tatum and I had severe headaches. Walter was  the only one feeling entirely himself, so Walter was put in the lead and  in the lead he remained all day.    [Illustration: The South Peak from about 18,000 feet.    The ridge with two peaks in the background is shaped like a horseshoe,  and the highest point on the mountain is on another little ridge just  beyond, parallel with the ridge that shows, almost at the middle point  between the two peaks.]    [Sidenote: Start to the Summit]    [Sidenote: Cold]    We took a straight course up the great snow ridge directly south of our  camp and then around the peak into which it rises; quickly told but  slowly and most laboriously done. It was necessary to make the traverse  high up on this peak instead of around its base, so much had its ice and  snow been shattered by the earthquake on the lower portions. Once around  this peak, there rose before us the horseshoe ridge which carries the  ultimate height of Denali, a horseshoe ridge of snow opening to the east  with a low snow peak at either end, the centre of the ridge soaring  above both peaks. Above us was nothing visible but snow; the rocks were  all beneath, the last rocks standing at about 19,000 feet. Our progress  was exceedingly slow. It was bitterly cold; all the morning toes and  fingers were without sensation, kick them and beat them as we would. We  were all clad in full winter hand and foot gear--more gear than had  sufficed at 50 deg. below zero on the Yukon trail. Within the writer's  No. 16 moccasins were three pairs of heavy hand-knitted woollen socks,  two pairs of camel's-hair socks, and a pair of thick felt socks; while  underneath them, between them and the iron \"creepers,\" were the soles  cut from a pair of felt shoes. Upon his hands were a pair of the  thickest Scotch wool gloves, thrust inside huge lynx-paw mitts lined  with Hudson Bay duffle. His moose-hide breeches and shirt, worn all the  winter on the trail, were worn throughout this climb; over the shirt was  a thick sweater and over all the usual Alaskan \"parkee\" amply furred  around the hood; underneath was a suit of the heaviest Jaeger  underwear--yet until nigh noon feet were like lumps of iron and fingers  were constantly numb. That north wind was cruelly cold, and there can be  no possible question that cold is felt much more keenly in the thin air  of nineteen thousand feet than it is below. But the north wind was  really our friend, for nothing but a north wind will drive all vapor  from this mountain. Karstens beat his feet so violently and so  continually against the hard snow to restore the circulation that two of  his toe-nails sloughed off afterward. By eleven o'clock we had been  climbing for six hours and were well around the peak, advancing toward  the horseshoe ridge, but even then there were grave doubts if we should  succeed in reaching it that day, it was so cold. A hint from any member  of the party that his feet were actually freezing--a hint expected all  along--would have sent us all back. When there is no sensation left in  the feet at all it is, however, difficult to be quite sure if they be  actually freezing or not--and each one was willing to give the attempt  upon the summit the benefit of the doubt. What should we have done with  the ordinary leather climbing boots? But once entirely around the peak  we were in a measure sheltered from the north wind, and the sun full  upon us gave more warmth. It was hereabouts, and not, surely, at the  point indicated in the photograph in Mr. Belmore Browne's book, that the  climbing party of last year was driven back by the blizzard that  descended upon them when close to their goal. Not until we had stopped  for lunch and had drunk the scalding tea from the thermos bottles, did  we all begin to have confidence that this day would see the completion  of the ascent. But the writer's shortness of breath became more and more  distressing as he rose. The familiar fits of panting took a more acute  form; at such times everything would turn black before his eyes and he  would choke and gasp and seem unable to get breath at all. Yet a few  moments' rest restored him completely, to struggle on another twenty or  thirty paces and to sink gasping upon the snow again. All were more  affected in the breathing than they had been at any time before--it was  curious to see every man's mouth open for breathing--but none of the  others in this distressing way. Before the traverse around the peak just  mentioned, Walter had noticed the writer's growing discomfort and had  insisted upon assuming the mercurial barometer. The boy's eager kindness  was gladly accepted and the instrument was surrendered. So it did not  fall to the writer's credit to carry the thing to the top as he had  wished.    [Sidenote: Climbing-Irons]    The climbing grew steeper and steeper; the slope that had looked easy  from below now seemed to shoot straight up. For the most part the  climbing-irons gave us sufficient footing, but here and there we came to  softer snow, where they would not take sufficient hold and we had to cut  steps. The calks in these climbing-irons were about an inch and a  quarter long; we wished they had been two inches. The creepers are a  great advantage in the matter of speed, but they need long points. They  are not so safe as step-cutting, and there is the ever-present danger  that unless one is exceedingly careful one will step upon the rope with  them and their sharp calks sever some of the strands. They were,  however, of great assistance and saved a deal of laborious step-cutting.    At last the crest of the ridge was reached and we stood well above the  two peaks that mark the ends of the horseshoe.[4]    Also it was evident that we were well above the great North Peak across  the Grand Basin. Its crest had been like an index on the snow beside us  as we climbed, and we stopped for a few moments when it seemed that we  were level with it. We judged it to be about five hundred feet lower  than the South Peak.    [Illustration: The climbing-irons.]    But still there stretched ahead of us, and perhaps one hundred feet  above us, another small ridge with a north and south pair of little  haycock summits. This is the real top of Denali. From below, this  ultimate ridge merges indistinguishably with the crest of the horseshoe  ridge, but it is not a part of it but a culminating ridge beyond it.  With keen excitement we pushed on. Walter, who had been in the lead all  day, was the first to scramble up; a native Alaskan, he is the first  human being to set foot upon the top of Alaska's great mountain, and he  had well earned the lifelong distinction. Karstens and Tatum were hard  upon his heels, but the last man on the rope, in his enthusiasm and  excitement somewhat overpassing his narrow wind margin, had almost to be  hauled up the last few feet, and fell unconscious for a moment upon the  floor of the little snow basin that occupies the top of the mountain.  This, then, is the actual summit, a little crater-like snow basin, sixty  or sixty-five feet long and twenty to twenty-five feet wide, with a  haycock of snow at either end--the south one a little higher than the  north. On the southwest this little basin is much corniced, and the  whole thing looked as though every severe storm might somewhat change  its shape.    So soon as wind was recovered we shook hands all round and a brief  prayer of thanksgiving to Almighty God was said, that He had granted us  our hearts' desire and brought us safely to the top of His great  mountain.    [Sidenote: The Instrument Readings]    This prime duty done, we fell at once to our scientific tasks. The  instrument-tent was set up, the mercurial barometer, taken out of its  leather case and then out of its wooden case, was swung upon its tripod  and a rough zero established, and it was left awhile to adjust itself to  conditions before a reading was attempted. It was a great gratification  to get it to the top uninjured. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#14)"],[1,"oises, started to make up for lost time on arriving in the street  once more.    \"A thoroughly unpleasant neighbourhood,\" he said, critically  surveying the dark streets. \"I fear me, Comrade Windsor, that we  have been somewhat rash in venturing as far into the middle west as  this. If ever there was a blighted locality where low-browed  desperadoes might be expected to spring with whoops of joy from  every corner, this blighted locality is that blighted locality.  But we must carry on. In which direction, should you say, does this  arena lie?\"    It had begun to rain as they left Billy's lodgings. Psmith turned  up the collar of his Burberry.    \"We suffer much in the cause of Literature,\" he said. \"Let us  inquire of this genial soul if he knows where the Highfield is.\"    The pedestrian referred to proved to be going there himself. They  went on together, Psmith courteously offering views on the weather  and forecasts of the success of Kid Brady in the approaching  contest.    Rattling on, he was alluding to the prominent part _Cosy Moments_ had  played in the affair, when a rough thrust from Windsor's elbow  brought home to him his indiscretion.    He stopped suddenly, wishing he had not said as much. Their  connection with that militant journal was not a thing even to be  suggested to casual acquaintances, especially in such a  particularly ill-lighted neighbourhood as that through which they  were now passing.    Their companion, however, who seemed to be a man of small speech,  made no comment. Psmith deftly turned the conversation back to the  subject of the weather, and was deep in a comparison of the  respective climates of England and the United States, when they  turned a corner and found themselves opposite a gloomy, barn-like  building, over the door of which it was just possible to decipher  in the darkness the words \"Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club.\"    The tickets which Billy Windsor had obtained from his newspaper  friend were for one of the boxes. These proved to be sort of  sheep-pens of unpolished wood, each with four hard chairs in it.  The interior of the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club was  severely free from anything in the shape of luxury and ornament.  Along the four walls were raised benches in tiers. On these were  seated as tough-looking a collection of citizens as one might wish  to see. On chairs at the ring-side were the reporters, with tickers  at their sides, by means of which they tapped details of each round  through to their down-town offices, where write-up reporters were  waiting to read off and elaborate the messages. In the centre of  the room, brilliantly lighted by half a dozen electric chandeliers,  was the ring.    There were preliminary bouts before the main event. A burly  gentleman in shirt-sleeves entered the ring, followed by two slim  youths in fighting costume and a massive person in a red jersey,  blue serge trousers, and yellow braces, who chewed gum with an  abstracted air throughout the proceedings.    The burly gentleman gave tongue in a voice that cleft the air like  a cannon-ball.    \"Ex-hib-it-i-on four-round bout between Patsy Milligan and Tommy  Goodley, members of this club. Patsy on my right, Tommy on my left.  Gentlemen will kindly stop smokin'.\"    The audience did nothing of the sort. Possibly they did not apply  the description to themselves. Possibly they considered the appeal  a mere formula. Somewhere in the background a gong sounded, and  Patsy, from the right, stepped briskly forward to meet Tommy,  approaching from the left.    The contest was short but energetic. At intervals the combatants  would cling affectionately to one another, and on these occasions  the red-jerseyed man, still chewing gum and still wearing the same  air of being lost in abstract thought, would split up the mass by  the simple method of ploughing his way between the pair. Towards  the end of the first round Thomas, eluding a left swing, put  Patrick neatly to the floor, where the latter remained for the  necessary ten seconds.    The remaining preliminaries proved disappointing. So much so that  in the last of the series a soured sportsman on one of the benches  near the roof began in satirical mood to whistle the \"Merry Widow  Waltz.\" It was here that the red-jerseyed thinker for the first and  last time came out of his meditative trance. He leaned over the  ropes, and spoke--without heat, but firmly.    \"If that guy whistling back up yonder thinks he can do better than  these boys, he can come right down into the ring.\"    The whistling ceased.    There was a distinct air of relief when the last preliminary was  finished and preparations for the main bout began. It did not  commence at once. There were formalities to be gone through,  introductions and the like. The burly gentleman reappeared from  nowhere, ushering into the ring a sheepishly-grinning youth in a  flannel suit.    \"In-ter-_doo_-cin' Young Leary,\" he bellowed impressively, \"a noo  member of this chub, who will box some good boy here in September.\"    He walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark. A  raucous welcome was accorded to the new member.    Two other notable performers were introduced in a similar manner,  and then the building became suddenly full of noise, for a tall  youth in a bath-robe, attended by a little army of assistants, had  entered the ring. One of the army carried a bright green bucket, on  which were painted in white letters the words \"Cyclone Al.  Wolmann.\" A moment later there was another, though a far lesser,  uproar, as Kid Brady, his pleasant face wearing a self-conscious  smirk, ducked under the ropes and sat down in the opposite corner.    \"Ex-hib-it-i-on ten-round bout,\" thundered the burly gentleman,  \"between Cyclone. Al. Wolmann--\"    Loud applause. Mr. Wolmann was one of the famous, a fighter with a  reputation from New York to San Francisco. He was generally  considered the most likely man to give the hitherto invincible  Jimmy Garvin a hard battle for the light-weight championship.    \"Oh, you Al.!\" roared the crowd.    Mr. Wolmann bowed benevolently.    \"--and Kid Brady, members of this--\"    There was noticeably less applause for the Kid. He was an unknown.  A few of those present had heard of his victories in the West, but  these were but a small section of the crowd. When the faint  applause had ceased, Psmith rose to his feet.    \"Oh, you Kid!\" he observed encouragingly.    \"I should not like Comrade Brady,\" he said, reseating himself, \"to  think that he has no friend but his poor old mother, as, you will  recollect, occurred on a previous occasion.\"    The burly gentleman, followed by the two armies of assistants,  dropped down from the ring, and the gong sounded.    Mr. Wolmann sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a  spring. He seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone, it  is never too soon to begin behaving like one. He danced round the  Kid with an india-rubber agility. The _Cosy Moments_ representative  exhibited more stolidity. Except for the fact that he was in  fighting attitude, with one gloved hand moving slowly in the  neighbourhood of his stocky chest, and the other pawing the air on a  line with his square jaw, one would have said that he did not  realise the position of affairs. He wore the friendly smile of the  good-natured guest who is led forward by his hostess to join in some  round game.    Suddenly his opponent's long left shot out. The Kid, who had been  strolling forward, received it under the chin, and continued to  stroll forward as if nothing of note had happened. He gave the  impression of being aware that Mr. Wolmann had committed a breach  of good taste and of being resolved to pass it off with ready tact.    The Cyclone, having executed a backward leap, a forward leap, and a  feint, landed heavily with both hands. The Kid's genial smile did  not even quiver, but he continued to move forward. His opponent's  left flashed out again, but this time, instead of ignoring the  matter, the Kid replied with a heavy right swing; and Mr. Wolmann,  leaping back, found himself against the ropes. By the time he had  got out of that uncongenial position, two more of the Kid's swings  had found their mark. Mr. Wolmann, somewhat perturbed, scuttered  out into the middle of the ring, the Kid following in his  self-contained, solid way.    The Cyclone now became still more cyclonic. He had a left arm  which seemed to open out in joints like a telescope. Several times  when the Kid appeared well out of distance there was a thud as a  brown glove ripped in over his guard and jerked his head back. But  always he kept boring in, delivering an occasional right to the  body with the pleased smile of an infant destroying a Noah's Ark  with a tack-hammer. Despite these efforts, however, he was plainly  getting all the worst of it. Energetic Mr. Wolmann, relying on his  long left, was putting in three blows to his one. When the gong  sounded, ending the first round, the house was practically solid  for the Cyclone. Whoops and yells rose from everywhere. The  building rang with shouts of, \"Oh, you Al.!\"    Psmith turned sadly to Billy.    \"It seems to me, Comrade Windsor,\" he said, \"that this merry  meeting looks like doing Comrade Brady no good. I should not be  surprised at any moment to see his head bounce off on to the  floor.\"    \"Wait,\" said Billy. \"He'll win yet.\"    \"You think so?\"    \"Sure. He comes from Wyoming,\" said Billy with simple confidence.    Rounds two and three were a repetition of round one. The Cyclone  raged almost unchecked about the ring. In one lightning rally in  the third he brought his right across squarely on to the Kid's jaw.  It was a blow which should have knocked any boxer out. The Kid  merely staggered slightly and returned to business, still smiling.    \"See!\" roared Billy enthusiastically in Psmith's ear, above the  uproar. \"He doesn't mind it! He likes it!"]]]
