[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#14)"],[1," the conversation to listen well.    Listen to others patiently, especially the poor.    Sharp sayings are an evidence of low breeding.    Shun faultfindings and faultfinders.    Never utter an uncomplimentary word against anyone.    Compliments delicately hinted and sincerely intended are a grace in  conversation.    Commendation of gifts and cleverness properly put are in good taste, but  praise of beauty is offensive.    Repeating kind expressions is proper.    Compliments given in a joke may be gratefully received in earnest.    The manner and tone are important parts of a compliment.    Avoid egotism.    Don't talk of yourself, or of your friends or your deeds.    Give no sign that you appreciate your own merits.    Do not become a distributer of the small talk of a community. The smiles of  your auditors do not mean respect.    Avoid giving the impression of one filled with \"suppressed egotism.\"    Never mention your own peculiarities; for culture destroys vanity.    Avoid exaggeration.    Do not be too positive.    Do not talk of display oratory.    Do not try to lead in conversation, looking around to enforce silence.    Lay aside affected silly etiquette for the natural dictates of the heart.    Direct the conversation where others can join with you and impart to you  useful information.    Avoid oddity. Eccentricity is shallow vanity.    Be modest.    Be what you wish to seem.    Avoid repeating a brilliant or clever saying.    {82}    [Illustration: THINKING ONLY OF DRESS.]    If you find bashfulness or embarrassment coming upon you, do or say  something at once. The commonest matter gently stated is better than an  embarrassing silence. Sometimes changing your position, or looking into a  book for a moment may relieve your embarrassment, and dispel any settling  stiffness.    Avoid telling many stories, or repeating a story more than once in the same  company.    Never treat any one as if you simply wanted him to tell stories. People  laugh and despise such a one.    Never tell a coarse story. No wit or preface can make it excusable.    Tell a story, if at all, only as an illustration, and not for itself. Tell  it accurately.    Be careful in asking questions for the purpose of starting conversation or  drawing out a person, not to be rude or intrusive.    Never take liberties by staring, or by any rudeness.    Never infringe upon any established regulations among strangers.    Do not always prove yourself to be the one in the right. The right will  appear. You need only give it a chance.    Avoid argument in conversation. It is discourteous to your host.    Cultivate paradoxes in conversation with your peers. They add interest to  common-place matters. To strike the harmless faith of ordinary people in  any public idol is waste, but such a movement with those able to reply is  better.    Never discourse upon your ailments.    Never use words of the meaning or pronunciation of which you are uncertain.    Avoid discussing your own or other people's domestic concerns.    Never prompt a slow speaker, as if you had all the ability. In conversing  with a foreigner who may be learning our language, it is excusable to help  him in some delicate way.    Never give advice unasked.    Do not manifest impatience.    Do not interrupt another when speaking.    Do not find fault, though you may gently criticise.    Do not appear to notice inaccuracies of speech in others.    Do not always commence a conversation by allusion to the weather.    Do not, when narrating an incident, continually say, \"you see,\" \"you know.\"  {83}    Do not allow yourself to lose temper or speak excitedly.    Do not introduce professional or other topics that the company generally  cannot take an interest in.    Do not talk very loud. A firm, clear, distinct, yet mild, gentle, and  musical voice has great power.    Do not be absent-minded, requiring the speaker to repeat what has been said  that you may understand.    Do not try to force yourself into the confidence of others.    Do not use profanity, vulgar terms, words of double meaning, or language  that will bring the blush to anyone.    Do not allow yourself to speak ill of the absent one if it can be avoided.  The day may come when some friend will be needed to defend you in your  absence.    Do not speak with contempt and ridicule of a locality which you may be  visiting. Find something to truthfully praise and commend; thus make  yourself agreeable.    Do not make a pretense of gentility, nor parade the fact that you are a  descendant of any notable family. You must pass for just what you are, and  must stand on your own merit.    Do not contradict. In making a correction say, \"I beg your pardon, but I  had the impression that it was so and so.\" Be careful in contradicting, as  you may be wrong yourself.    Do not be unduly familiar; you will merit contempt if you are. Neither  should you be dogmatic in your assertions, arrogating to yourself such  consequences in your opinions.    Do not be too lavish in your praise of various members of your own family  when speaking to strangers; the person to whom you are speaking may know  some faults that you do not.    Do not feel it incumbent upon yourself to carry your point in conversation.  Should the person with whom you are conversing feel the same, your talk may  lead into violent argument.    Do not try to pry into the private affairs of others by asking what their  profits are, what things cost, whether Melissa ever had a beau, and why  Amarette never got married? All such questions are extremely impertinent  and are likely to meet with rebuke.    Do not whisper in company; do not engage in private conversation; do not  speak a foreign language which the general company present may not  understand, unless it is understood that the foreigner is unable to speak  your own language.           *       *       *       *       *      {84}    THE TOILET    OR    The Care of the Person.           *       *       *       *       *    IMPORTANT RULES.    [Illustration: Widower Jones and Widow Smith.]    1. GOOD APPEARANCE.--The first care of all persons should be for their  personal appearance. Those who are slovenly or careless in their habits are  unfit for refined society, and cannot possibly make a good appearance in  it. A well-bred person will always cultivate habits of the most scrupulous  neatness. A gentleman or lady is always well dressed. The garment may be  plain or of coarse material, or even worn \"thin and shiny,\" but if it is  carefully brushed and neat it can be worn with dignity. {85}    2. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS.--Personal appearance depends greatly on the  careful toilet and scrupulous attention to dress. The first point which  marks the gentleman or lady in appearance is rigid cleanliness. This remark  supplies to the body and everything which covers it. A clean skin--only to  be secured by frequent baths--is indispensable.    3. THE TEETH.--The teeth should receive the utmost attention. Many a young  man has been disgusted with a lady by seeing her unclean and discolored  teeth. It takes but a few moments, and if necessary secure some simple  tooth powder or rub the teeth thoroughly every day with a linen  handkerchief, and it will give the teeth and mouth a beautiful and clean  appearance.    4. THE HAIR AND BEARD.--The hair should be thoroughly brushed and well  kept, and the beard of men properly trimmed. Men should not let their hair  grow long and shaggy.    5. UNDERCLOTHING.--The matter of cleanliness extends to all articles of  clothing, underwear as well as the outer clothing. Cleanliness is a mark of  true utility. The clothes need not necessarily be of a rich and expensive  quality, but they can all be kept clean. Some persons have an odor about  them that is very offensive, simply on account of their underclothing being  worn too long without washing. This odor of course cannot be detected by  the person who wears the soiled garments, but other persons easily detect  it and are offended by it.    6. THE BATH.--No person should think for a moment that they can be popular  in society without regular bathing. A bath should be taken at least once a  week, and if the feet perspire they should be washed several times a week,  as the case may require. It is not unfrequent that young men are seen with  dirty ears and neck. This is unpardonable and boorish, and shows gross  neglect. Occasionally a young lady will be called upon unexpectedly when  her neck and smiling face are not emblems of cleanliness. Every lady owes  it to herself to be fascinating; every gentleman is bound, for his own  sake, to be presentable; but beyond this there is the obligation to  society, to one's friends, and to those with whom we may be brought in  contact.    7. SOILED GARMENTS.--A young man's garments may not be expensive, yet there  is no excuse for wearing a soiled collar and a soiled shirt, or carrying a  soiled handkerchief. No one should appear as though he had slept in a  stable, shaggy hair, soiled clothing or garments indifferently put on and  carelessly buttoned. A young man's vest should always be kept buttoned in  the presence of ladies. {86}    8. THE BREATH.--Care should be taken to remedy an offensive breath without  delay. Nothing renders one so unpleasant to one's acquaintance, or is such  a source of misery to one's self. The evil may be from some derangement of  the stomach or some defective condition of the teeth, or catarrhal  affection of the throat and nose.

Learn all you can about conditions and where it's best to  hit that....\"    Drew found Hart already mounted, Kirby and Boyd waiting.    \"Hart says we're ridin' out,\" the Texan said. \"Goin' to cover the high  lines?\"    \"Scout, yes. South of here. River crossin's comin' up.\"    \"No time for shadin' in this man's war,\" Kirby observed.    \"Shadin'?\" Boyd repeated as a question.    \"Sittin' nice an' easy under a tree while some other poor hombre prowls  around the herd,\" Kirby translated. \"It's a kinda restin' I ain't had  much of lately. Nor like to....\"    They put Calhoun behind them, and Hart led them cross-country. But at  each new turn of the back country roads Drew added another line or two  on the map he sketched in on paper which Boyd surprisingly produced from  his bulging sack of loot.    The younger boy looked self-conscious as he handed it over. \"Thought as  how I might want to write a letter.\"    Drew studied him. \"You do that!\" He made it an order. There had been no  chance to leave Boyd in Calhoun. But there was still Cadiz as a  possibility. He did not believe this vague story about Union gold in the  bank. And the company might never enter the town in force at all. So  that Boyd, left behind, would not attract the unfavorable attention of  the authorities.    It began to rain again, and the roads were mire traps. As they struggled  on into evening Kirby found a barn which appeared to be out by itself  with no house in attendance. The door was wedged open with a drift of  undisturbed soil and Boyd, exploring into a ragged straggle of brush in  search of a well, reported a house cellar hole. The place must be  abandoned and so safe.    \"We'll be in Cadiz tomorrow,\" Hart said.    \"An' how do we ride in?\" Kirby wanted to know. \"Another  bearer-of-the-flag stunt?\"    \"Is Cadiz a Union town?\" Drew asked Hart.    The other laughed. \"Not much, it ain't. This is tobacco country; you  seen that for yourself today. An' there's guerrillas to give the Yankees  trouble. They hole up in the Brelsford Caves, six or seven miles outta  town. We can ride right in, and there ain't nobody gonna care.\"    \"Nice to know these things ahead'a time,\" Kirby remarked. \"So we ride  in--lookin' for what?\"    Hart glanced at Drew but remained silent. The scout shrugged.  \"Information about the rivers and any stray garrison news. You have kin  here, Hart?\"    \"Some.\" But the other did not elaborate on that.    Drew was thinking about those guerrillas; their presence did not match  Hart's story about the Yankee gold in the bank. Such irregulars would  have been after that long ago. He didn't know why Hart had pitched  Campbell such a tale, but he was dubious about the whole setup now.  Better make this a quick trip in--and out--of town.          7    _A Mule for a River_      For a Confederate patrol, they looked respectable enough as they rode  into Cadiz. Though they lacked the uniformity of a Yankee squad, their  dark shirts, \"impressed\" breeches, and good boots gave an impression of  a common dress, and Kirby had even acquired a hat.    They slung their captured rifles before entering town and progressed at  a quiet amble which suggested good will. But there was no mistaking the  fact that they attracted attention, immediately and to some purpose. A  small boy, balancing on a fence, put his fingers to his mouth and  released a piercing whistle.    King's response to that was vigorous. Rearing, until he stood almost  upright on his hind feet, the stallion pawed the air. Drew barely kept  his seat. He fought with all his knowledge of horsemanship to bring the  stud back to earth and under control. And he could hear Kirby's laugh  and Boyd calling out some inarticulate warning or advice.    \"Better git that mule--or run down this one's mainspring some,\" the  Texan said when Drew had King again with four feet on the ground, though  weaving in a sideways dance.    \"You men--what are you doing here?\" A horseman looked over the heads of  the crowd to the four troopers.    \"Passin' through, suh. Leastwise we was, until greeted--\" Kirby answered  courteously.    Drew assessed the questioner's well-cut riding clothes, his good linen,  and fine gloves. The rider was middle-aged, his authority more evident  because of that fact. This was either one of the wealthy planters of the  district or some important inhabitant of Cadiz. There was a wagon  drawing up behind him, a span of well-cared-for mules in harness with a  Negro driver.    The mules held Drew's attention. King's reaction to that sudden whistle  was a warning. He had no wish to ride such an animal into a picket  skirmish. The sleekness of the mules appealed to his desire to rid  himself of the unmanageable stud.    Now he edged the sidling King closer to the wagon. The driver watched  him with apprehension. Whether he guessed Drew's intention or whether he  dreaded the near approach of the stallion was a question which did not  bother the scout.    \"You there,\" Drew hailed the driver. \"I'll take one of those mules!\"    As always, he hated these enforced trades and spoke in a peremptory way,  wanting to get the matter finished.    \"You, suh--\" the solid citizen turned his horse to face the scout--\"what  gives you the right to take that mule?\"    With a visible sigh of relief, the Negro relaxed on the driver's seat,  willing to let the other carry on the argument.    \"Nothing, except I have to have a mount I can depend upon.\" Drew did not  know why he was explaining, or even why he wanted the mule so acutely  right now. Except that he was tired, tired of the days in the saddle, of  being on the run, of these small Kentucky towns into which they rode to  loot and ride off again. The Yankees in Bardstown had been fair game,  and their bluff there had been an adventure. But Calhoun left a sour  taste in his mouth, and he didn't like the vague order which had brought  him to Cadiz. So his dislike boiled over, to settle into a sullen  determination to rid himself of one irritation--this undependable horse.    \"Do I assume, suh, that you are part of General Morgan's command?\" Sharp  blue eyes studied Drew across the well-curried backs of the mules.    \"Yes, suh.\"    The man gave a nod, which might have been for some thought of his own.    \"We have heard some rumors of your coming, suh,\" the other continued.  \"You, Nelson,\" he spoke to the Negro, \"take this team up to the livery  stable and tell Mr. Emory I want Hannibal saddled! Then you bring him  back here and give him to this gentleman!\"    \"Yes, suh. Hannibal--wi' saddle--for this young gentlem'n.\"    \"Hannibal, suh,\" the man said to Drew, \"is a mule, but a remarkable one,  riding trained and strong. I think you will find him quite usable. Do I  understand we are about to be favored by a visit from General Morgan?\"    Drew dismounted. Now he made a business of squinting up at the sun as if  to tell time. \"Not for a while, suh.\" He remained cautious; though he  guessed that his questioner's sympathies were at least not openly Union.    There was a stir in the gathering crowd. Hart was leaning from his  saddle, talking earnestly to two men flanking him on either side.    \"May I offer you some refreshment, gentlemen. I am James Pryor, at your  service--\"    Automatically Drew responded to the manners of Red Springs. \"Drew  Rennie, suh. Anson Kirby, Boyd Barrett....\" He looked around for Hart,  only to see the other disappearing into an alley with his two companions  from the crowd.    \"Suh, that's a right heartenin' offer,\" Kirby said, smiling. \"Trail dust  sure does make a man's throat dryer'n an alkali flat!\"    \"Mark Hale over here has just the answer for that difficulty, gentlemen.  If you will accompany me--\"    They left the glare of the sunlit street, following their host into a  small shop where a quantity of strange smells fought for supremacy.  Kirby stared about him puzzled, but his look changed to an expression of  pure bafflement and outrage as Pryor gave his order to the smaller man  who came from a back room.    \"Mark, these gentlemen need some of that good lemonade you make--if you  have some cold and ready.\"    Drew heard Kirby's muffled snort of protest and wanted so badly to laugh  that the struggle to choke off that sound was a pain in his chest. Mr.  Pryor smiled at them blandly.    \"M' boys, nothing better on a really hot day than some of Mark's  lemonade. Nothing like it in this part of Kentucky. Ah, that looks like  a draft fit for the gods, Mark, it certainly does!\"    Hale had bobbed out of his inner room again, shepherding before him a  Negro boy who walked with exaggerated caution, balancing a tray on which  stood four tall glasses, beaded with visible moisture. There was a  sprig of green mint standing sentry in each.    \"Drink up, gentlemen.\" Under Mr. Pryor's commanding eye they each took a  glass and a first sip.    But it was good--cool as it went slipping down the throat bearing that  blessed chill with it, tart on the tongue, and fresh. Drew had sipped,  but now he gulped, and he noted over the rim of his own glass, that  Kirby was following his example. Mr. Pryor consumed his portion at a  more genteel rate of intake.    \"This allays that trail dust of yours, Mr. Kirby?\" He inquired with no  more than usual solicitude, but there was a faint trace of amusement in  his small smile.    Kirby met the challenge promptly. \"Ably, suh, ably!\" He raised his  half-filled glass. \"To your very good health, suh. I don't know when  I've had me a more satisfyin' drink!\"    Pryor bowed. He was still smiling as he glanced at Drew.    \"You have business in Cadiz, suh? Beyond that of swapping that  firebreather of yours for another mount, I mean? Perhaps I can be of  service in some other way....\"    Drew cradled his glass in both hands. The condensing moisture made it  slippery, but the chill was pleasant to feel.    \"Do you have any news about the Cumberland River, suh?\" he asked. Pryor"]]]
