He had then distinctly heard the  deceased, having sent the Captain on his errand, turn round laughing  and run down the passage towards its other end, where was the prisoner's  dressing-room. In idle curiosity as to the rapid movement of his  friends, he had strolled out to the head of the passage himself and  looked down it towards the prisoner's door. Did he see anything in the  passage? Yes; he saw something in the passage.    Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval, during which the  witness looked down, and for all his usual composure seemed to have more  than his usual pallor. Then the barrister said in a lower voice, which  seemed at once sympathetic and creepy: \"Did you see it distinctly?\"    Sir Wilson Seymour, however moved, had his excellent brains in full  working-order. \"Very distinctly as regards its outline, but quite  indistinctly, indeed not at all, as regards the details inside the  outline. The passage is of such length that anyone in the middle of it  appears quite black against the light at the other end.\" The witness  lowered his steady eyes once more and added: \"I had noticed the fact  before, when Captain Cutler first entered it.\" There was another  silence, and the judge leaned forward and made a note.    \"Well,\" said Sir Walter patiently, \"what was the outline like? Was it,  for instance, like the figure of the murdered woman?\"    \"Not in the least,\" answered Seymour quietly.    \"What did it look like to you?\"    \"It looked to me,\" replied the witness, \"like a tall man.\"    Everyone in court kept his eyes riveted on his pen, or his  umbrella-handle, or his book, or his boots or whatever he happened to be  looking at. They seemed to be holding their eyes away from the prisoner  by main force; but they felt his figure in the dock, and they felt it  as gigantic. Tall as Bruno was to the eye, he seemed to swell taller and  taller when an eyes had been torn away from him.    Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face, smoothing his  black silk robes, and white silk whiskers. Sir Wilson was leaving the  witness-box, after a few final particulars to which there were many  other witnesses, when the counsel for the defence sprang up and stopped  him.    \"I shall only detain you a moment,\" said Mr Butler, who was a  rustic-looking person with red eyebrows and an expression of partial  slumber. \"Will you tell his lordship how you knew it was a man?\"    A faint, refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour's features. \"I'm  afraid it is the vulgar test of trousers,\" he said. \"When I saw daylight  between the long legs I was sure it was a man, after all.\"    Butler's sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion. \"After  all!\" he repeated slowly. \"So you did think at first it was a woman?\"    Seymour looked troubled for the first time. \"It is hardly a point of  fact,\" he said, \"but if his lordship would like me to answer for my  impression, of course I shall do so. There was something about the thing  that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man; somehow the  curves were different. And it had something that looked like long hair.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Mr Butler, K.C., and sat down suddenly, as if he had  got what he wanted.    Captain Cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness than Sir  Wilson, but his account of the opening incidents was solidly the same.  He described the return of Bruno to his dressing-room, the dispatching  of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley, his return to the  upper end of the passage, the thing he saw in the passage, his suspicion  of Seymour, and his struggle with Bruno. But he could give little  artistic assistance about the black figure that he and Seymour had seen.  Asked about its outline, he said he was no art critic--with a somewhat  too obvious sneer at Seymour. Asked if it was a man or a woman, he said  it looked more like a beast--with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner.  But the man was plainly shaken with sorrow and sincere anger, and  Cowdray quickly excused him from confirming facts that were already  fairly clear.    The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross-examination;  although (as was his custom) even in being brief, he seemed to take a  long time about it. \"You used a rather remarkable expression,\" he said,  looking at Cutler sleepily. \"What do you mean by saying that it looked  more like a beast than a man or a woman?\"    Cutler seemed seriously agitated. \"Perhaps I oughtn't to have said  that,\" he said; \"but when the brute has huge humped shoulders like a  chimpanzee, and bristles sticking out of its head like a pig--\"    Mr Butler cut short his curious impatience in the middle. \"Never mind  whether its hair was like a pig's,\" he said, \"was it like a woman's?\"    \"A woman's!\" cried the soldier. \"Great Scott, no!\"    \"The last witness said it was,\" commented the counsel, with unscrupulous  swiftness. \"And did the figure have any of those serpentine and  semi-feminine curves to which eloquent allusion has been made? No? No  feminine curves? The figure, if I understand you, was rather heavy and  square than otherwise?\"    \"He may have been bending forward,\" said Cutler, in a hoarse and rather  faint voice.    \"Or again, he may not,\" said Mr Butler, and sat down suddenly for the  second time.    The third, witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was the little Catholic  clergyman, so little, compared with the others, that his head seemed  hardly to come above the box, so that it was like cross-examining a  child. But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow got it into his head  (mostly by some ramifications of his family's religion) that Father  Brown was on the side of the prisoner, because the prisoner was wicked  and foreign and even partly black. Therefore he took Father Brown up  sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anything; and told  him to answer yes or no, and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry.  When Father Brown began, in his simplicity, to say who he thought the  man in the passage was, the barrister told him that he did not want his  theories.    \"A black shape was seen in the passage. And you say you saw the black  shape. Well, what shape was it?\"    Father Brown blinked as under rebuke; but he had long known the literal  nature of obedience. \"The shape,\" he said, \"was short and thick, but had  two sharp, black projections curved upwards on each side of the head or  top, rather like horns, and--\"    \"Oh! the devil with horns, no doubt,\" ejaculated Cowdray, sitting down  in triumphant jocularity. \"It was the devil come to eat Protestants.\"    \"No,\" said the priest dispassionately; \"I know who it was.\"    Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational, but real sense of  some monstrosity. They had forgotten the figure in the dock and thought  only of the figure in the passage. And the figure in the passage,  described by three capable and respectable men who had all seen it, was  a shifting nightmare: one called it a woman, and the other a beast, and  the other a devil....    The judge was looking at Father Brown with level and piercing eyes.  \"You are a most extraordinary witness,\" he said; \"but there is something  about you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth. Well,  who was the man you saw in the passage?\"    \"He was myself,\" said Father Brown.    Butler, K.C., sprang to his feet in an extraordinary stillness, and said  quite calmly: \"Your lordship will allow me to cross-examine?\" And then,  without stopping, he shot at Brown the apparently disconnected question:  \"You have heard about this dagger; you know the experts say the crime  was committed with a short blade?\"    \"A short blade,\" assented Brown, nodding solemnly like an owl, \"but a  very long hilt.\"    Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest had  really seen himself doing murder with a short dagger with a long hilt  (which seemed somehow to make it more horrible), he had himself hurried  on to explain.    \"I mean daggers aren't the only things with short blades. Spears  have short blades. And spears catch at the end of the steel just like  daggers, if they're that sort of fancy spear they had in theatres; like  the spear poor old Parkinson killed his wife with, just when she'd sent  for me to settle their family troubles--and I came just too late, God  forgive me! But he died penitent--he just died of being penitent. He  couldn't bear what he'd done.\"    The general impression in court was that the little priest, who was  gobbling away, had literally gone mad in the box. But the judge still  looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest; and the counsel  for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed.    \"If Parkinson did it with that pantomime spear,\" said Butler, \"he  must have thrust from four yards away. How do you account for signs of  struggle, like the dress dragged off the shoulder?\" He had slipped into  treating his mere witness as an expert; but no one noticed it now.    \"The poor lady's dress was torn,\" said the witness, \"because it was  caught in a panel that slid to just behind her. She struggled to free  herself, and as she did so Parkinson came out of the prisoner's room and  lunged with the spear.\"    \"A panel?\" repeated the barrister in a curious voice.    \"It was a looking-glass on the other side,\" explained Father Brown.  \"When I was in the dressing-room I noticed that some of them could  probably be slid out into the passage.\"    There was another vast and unnatural silence, and this time it was the  judge who spoke. \"So you really mean that when you looked down that  passage, the man you saw was yourself--in a mirror?\"    \"Yes, my lord; that was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States. Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"mustered on the forecastle, ready to board. All expected a desperate  resistance. Great was their surprise, then, when they were permitted  to take a raking position under the stern of the \"Hope,\" and to board  her without a shot being fired. But as Mugford, at the head of the  boarders, clambered over the taffrail, he heard the captain of the  \"Hope\" order the men to cut the topsail halliards and ties, with the  intention of so crippling the ship that the British squadron might  overhaul and recapture her.    \"Avast there!\" bawled Mugford, seeing through the plot in an instant,  and clapping a pistol to the head of the captain; \"if a knife is  touched to those ropes, not a man of this crew shall live.\"    This threat so terrified the captured sailors, that they relinquished  their design; and Mugford, crowding all sail on his prize, soon was  bowling along before a stiff breeze, with the British squadron in hot  pursuit. An examination of the ship's papers showed her to be the most  valuable prize yet taken by the Americans. In her hold were fifteen  hundred barrels of powder, a thousand carbines, a great number of  travelling carriages for cannon, and a most complete assortment of  artillery instruments and pioneer tools. While running for Boston  Harbor, through the channel known as Point Shirley gut, the vessel  grounded, but was soon floated, and taken safely to her anchorage. Her  arrival was most timely, as the American army was in the most dire  straits for gunpowder. It may well be imagined that there was no  longer any talk about revoking Capt. Mugford's commission.    Mugford remained in port only long enough to take a supply of powder  from his prize; then put to sea again. He well knew that the British  fleet that had chased him into Boston Harbor was still blockading the  harbor's mouth, but he hoped to evade it by going out through a  circuitous channel. Unluckily, in thus attempting to avoid the enemy,  the \"Franklin\" ran aground, and there remained hard and fast in full  view of the enemy. He had as consort the privateer schooner \"Lady  Washington,\" whose captain, seeing Mugford's dangerous predicament,  volunteered to remain near at hand and assist in the defence.    Mugford knew that his case was desperate, and made preparations for a  most determined resistance. Swinging his craft around, he mounted all  four of his guns on that side which commanded the channel in the  direction from which the enemy was expected. Boarding-nettings were  triced up, and strengthened with cables and cordage, to make an  effective barrier against the assaults of boarders. The men were  served with double rations of grog, and set to work sharpening the  cutlasses and spears, with which they were well provided. The work of  preparation was completed none too soon; for about nine o'clock  Mugford heard the rattle of oars in rowlocks, and saw boats gliding  towards the \"Franklin\" through the darkness.    \"Boat ahoy!\" he challenged. \"Keep off, or I shall fire into you.\"    \"Don't fire,\" was the response; \"we are friends from Boston coming to  your aid.\"    \"We want none of your aid,\" cried Mugford with an oath. Then, turning  to his crew, he shouted, \"Let them have it, boys.\"    The roar of the cannon then mingled with the rattle of the musketry,  the cries of the wounded, and the shouts and curses of the combatants,  as the British strove to clamber up the sides of the \"Franklin.\" Not  less than two hundred men were engaged on the side of the British, who  advanced to the fray in thirteen large barges, many of them carrying  swivel guns. Several boats dashed in close under the side of the  \"Franklin,\" and their crews strove manfully to board, but were beaten  back by the Yankees, who rained cutlass blows upon them. The long  pikes with which the Americans were armed proved particularly  effective. \"One man with that weapon is positive of having killed nine  of the enemy,\" says a newspaper of that day.    Unhappily, however, the heroic Mugford, while urging on his men to a  more vigorous resistance, was struck by a musket-ball, which inflicted  a mortal wound. At the moment the wound was received, he was reaching  out over the quarter to catch hold of the mast of one of the barges,  in the hope of upsetting her. As he fell to the deck, he called his  first lieutenant, and said, \"I am a dead man. Do not give up the  vessel; you will be able to beat them off.\" Nearly forty years after,  the heroic Lawrence, dying on the deck of the \"Chesapeake,\" repeated  Mugford's words, \"Don't give up the ship.\"    For about half an hour the battle raged fiercely. The British, beaten  back with great loss, returned again and again to the attack. The  boats would come under the lee of the \"Franklin;\" but, not being  provided with grappling-irons, the British were forced to lay hold of  the gunwales of the enemy with their hands, which the Americans  promptly lopped off with their cutlasses. Shots from the swivel guns  of the Yankee soon stove in two of the boats of the enemy, which sunk,  carrying down many of their crew. After nearly an hour of this  desperate fighting, the British withdrew, having lost about seventy  men. The only loss sustained by the Americans was that of their brave  commander Mugford.    About a month after this battle, there occurred off the coast of  Massachusetts a battle in which the Americans, though they fought with  the most undaunted bravery, were forced to strike their colors to  their adversary. The American was the privateer \"Yankee Hero\" of  Newburyport. She sailed from that place for Boston on the 7th of June  with only forty men aboard, intending to ship her full complement of  one hundred and twenty at Boston. As the \"Hero\" rounded Cape Ann, she  sighted a sail on the horizon, but in her short-handed condition did  not think it worth while to give chase. The stranger, however, had  caught sight of the \"Hero;\" and, a fresh southerly breeze springing  up, she began to close with the American. As she came closer, Capt.  Tracy of the \"Yankee Hero\" saw that she was a ship-of-war. Despite the  desperate efforts of the Americans to escape, their pursuer rapidly  overhauled them, and soon coming up within half a mile, opened fire  with her bow chasers. The brig returned the fire with a swivel gun,  which had little effect. Seeing this, Capt. Tracy ordered the firing  to cease until the ships should came to close quarters. The stranger  rapidly overhauled the privateer, keeping up all the time a vigorous  fire. Tracy with difficulty restrained the ardor of his men, who were  anxious to try to cripple their pursuer. When the enemy came within  pistol-shot, Tracy saw that the time for action on his part had come,  and immediately opened fire with all the guns and small-arms that  could be brought to bear. The only possible chance for escape lay in  crippling the big craft with a lucky shot; but broadside after  broadside was fired, and still the great ship came rushing along in  the wake of the flying privateer. Closer and closer drew the bulky  man-of-war, until her bow crept past the stern of the \"Yankee Hero,\"  and the marines upon her forecastle poured down a destructive volley  of musketry upon the brig's crowded deck. The plight of the privateer  was now a desperate one. Her heavy antagonist was close alongside, and  towered high above her, so that the marines on the quarter-deck and  forecastle of the Englishman were on a level with the leading blocks  of the Yankee. From the depressed guns of the frigate, a murderous  fire poured down upon the smaller craft. For an hour and twenty  minutes the two vessels continued the fight, pouring hot broadsides  into each other, and separated by less than a hundred feet of water.  The brisk breeze blowing carried away the clouds of smoke, and left  the men on the deck of the Yankee no protection from sharp-shooters on  the enemy's deck. Accordingly, the execution was frightful. Tracy,  from his post on the quarter-deck, saw his men falling like sheep,  while the continual volleys of the great ship had so cut the cordage  of the weaker vessel that escape was impossible. At last a musket-ball  struck Capt. Tracy in the thigh, and he fell bleeding to the deck. For  a moment his men wavered at their guns; but he called manfully to  them, from where he lay, to fight on boldly for the honor of the  \"Yankee Hero.\" Two petty officers had rushed to his assistance; and he  directed them to lay him upon a chest of arms upon the quarter-deck,  whence he might direct the course of the battle. But, strong though  was his spirit, his body was too weak to perform the task he had  allotted it; and, growing faint from pain and loss of blood, he was  carried below.    He lay unconscious for a few minutes, but was recalled to his senses  by the piteous cries of wounded men by whom he was surrounded. When he  came to himself, he saw the cabin filled with grievously wounded  people, bleeding and suffering for lack of surgical aid. The firing of  the privateer had ceased, but the enemy was still pouring in pitiless  broadsides. Enraged at this spectacle, Capt. Tracy ordered his men to  re-open the conflict, and directed that he be taken in a chair to the  quarter-deck. But, on getting into the chair, he was suddenly seized  with a fainting spell, and gave orders, by signs, that the colors be  struck.    When the inequality of the two enemies is considered, this action  appears to be a most notable reason for pride in the powers of the  Americans. The \"Yankee Hero\" was a low single-decked vessel of  fourteen guns, while her captor was the British frigate of thirty-two  guns. Yet the little American vessel had held her own for two hours,  and by good gunnery and skilful manoeuvring had succeeded in doing  almost as much damage as she had suffered.    In reading of the naval engagements of the Revolution, one is  impressed with the small sacrifice of life that attended the most"]]]
