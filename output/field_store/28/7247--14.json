Both were  occupied with their own thoughts, and strange thoughts they must have  been. They leisurely strolled to a store of sporting outfits, bought a  revolver and cartridges, had their shoes shined at the next corner, and  slowly wended their way toward the depot. Their actions were almost  mechanical. Suicide is an attack of insanity, a sort of mental plague.  If one has caught the fever, one is doomed. There is no escape from it.  At the same time it is contagious. The literary man was somewhat  infected by it. All his interests in life seemed to be dulled,  obliterated as it were. He could only think the one thought, \"Morrison  is going to kill himself. But who knows, he may, after all, turn up next  week with the excuse that he had changed his mind. No, not he!--it was  really too bad!\" Morrison, on the other hand, grew quite cheerful. With  him the idea that he would do it, had become so matter-of-fact, that he  ceased to think of it. Nothing could influence him any more. Even if  some vague current of soul activity should revolt at the very last  moment, he was certain that his hand would mechanically perform the  task.    \"Only one return ticket,\" he whispered as he approached the ticket  office. \"Oh, I almost forgot,\" replied his friend.    During the trip they silently sat opposite each other, smoking. Now and  then Morrison pointed out the beautiful sights. He seemed to be familiar  with the scenery. At their arrival in New Haven, at dusk, they at once  adjourned to a hotel and sat down at a table in the bar-room. They began  to talk about art, they discussed commercialism, the lack of  appreciation and the vanity of all serious work, at least as far as art  is concerned. They began to relate reminiscences of their student  years, and reviewed the hopes and ambitions of their youth. If they had  been realized, what wonders they would have accomplished!    \"I gave the other side a chance. They never responded. I waited for ten  long years, and now, it's all up. Let us have another drink, waiter, the  last.\" They clinked glasses. \"And now for a decent departure as in the  good old times, when Hegesias, the Cyrenaic, preached suicide in  Alexandria--\"    They arose. It had grown dark. They sauntered forth into the night.  Morrison seemed to know where he was going. \"I once spent very pleasant  days out here,\" he explained, \"years, I hardly remember how many years  ago.\" After that they did not converse any more. They finally arrived at  a beautiful avenue of old elms that extended far into the country. Its  deep, dark vista was lit up only by the shimmer of a distant lake.    Morrison stopped, seized his friend's hand, shook it, and said in a firm  voice: \"Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye.\"    And Morrison walked away. It was so dark that in a few moments his form  became invisible. Only his footsteps could still be heard. They grew  fainter and fainter. The tall, lean man stared after his friend into the  blackness of the night. His eyes grew dim.    A few rain drops fell on his face and hands. \"I hope it won't rain,\" he  murmured, \"it might make dying more difficult, but no--the sky is  clear.\" Then he slightly bent forward and listened eagerly. Everything  was calm, motionless, as in suspense. Nobody passed through the avenue.  Only in the adjoining side streets pedestrians flitted by like ghosts.    So this was the end! After having struggled bravely for years, after  living up to high ideals as well as one could, to go down a long, dark  avenue--a falling star flashed across the tree tops.    The tall, lean man pressed his hand to his heart, although he was not  certain of having heard a report, he felt, that his friend had arrived  at the goal of his life's journey. The game was up!           *       *       *       *       *    +Books to be had through Mother Earth+    +The Doukhobors:+ Their History in Russia; Their Migration to Canada.

The willingness  of readers from around the world to share their observations and  specialized knowledge is very helpful as we try to produce the best  possible publications. Please feel free to continue to write and  e-mail e-mail us. When submitting corrections or updates to the  Factbook, please include your source(s) of information. At least two  Factbook staffers review every submitted item. The sheer volume of  correspondence precludes detailed personal replies, but we sincerely  appreciate your time and interest in the Factbook. If you include  your e-mail address we will at least acknowledge your note. Thank  you again.    Answers to many frequently asked questions (FAQs) are explained in  the Notes and Definitions section in The World Factbook. Please  review this section to see if your question is already answered  there. In addition, we have compiled the following list of FAQs to  answer other common questions. Select from the following categories  to narrow your search:    General  Geography  Spelling and Pronunciation  Policies and Procedures  Technical      General    Can you provide additional information for a specific country?  The staff cannot provide data beyond what appears in The World  Factbook. The format and information in the Factbook are tailored to  the specific requirements of US Government officials and content is  focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes  suggestions for new entries.    How often is The World Factbook updated?  Formerly our Web site (and the published Factbook) were only updated  annually. Beginning in November 2001 we instituted a new system of  more frequent online updates. The World Factbook is currently  updated every two weeks.    The annual printed version of the Factbook is usually released about  midyear.

The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by  anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code  prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA  approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. If you have any  questions about your intended use, you should consult with legal  counsel. Further information on The World Factbook's use is  described on the Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a  courtesy, please cite The World Factbook when used.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,  departments, provinces, etc., in the country format?    The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,  territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative  units within a country. A good encyclopedia should provide  state/province-level information.    Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Previous versions of the Factbook, beginning with the 2000 edition,  are available for downloading - but not browsing - on the CIA Web  site. Hardcopy editions for earlier years are available from  libraries.    Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration  between the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations  or individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.      Geography    I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of  places,"]]]
