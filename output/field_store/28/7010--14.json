[Footnote 127: _L. and P._, i., 3809, 3820.]                       [Footnote 128: _Ib._, i., 3977.]                       [Footnote 129: _Ib._, i., 4005; see also _The War                     of 1512-13_ (Navy Records Society) where the                     documents are printed in full.]    Meanwhile, Henry's army was gathering at Calais.[130] On 30th      (p. 064)  June, at 7 P.M., the King himself landed. Before his departure, the  unfortunate Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, was brought to the  block for an alleged correspondence with his brother in Louis'  service, but really because rumours were rife of Louis' intention to  proclaim the White Rose as King of England.[131] On 21st July, Henry  left Calais to join his army, which had already advanced into French  territory. Heavy rains impeded its march and added to its discomfort.  Henry, we are told, did not put off his clothes, but rode round the  camp at three in the morning, cheering his men with the remark, \"Well,  comrades, now that we have suffered in the beginning, fortune promises  us better things, God willing\".[132] Near Ardres some German  mercenaries, of whom there were 8,000 with Henry's forces, pillaged  the church; Henry promptly had three of them hanged. On 1st August the  army sat down before Therouanne; on the 10th, the Emperor arrived to  serve as a private at a hundred crowns a day under the English  banners. Three days later a large French force arrived at Guinegate to  raise the siege; a panic seized it, and the bloodless rout that  followed was named the Battle of Spurs. Louis d'Orleans, Duc de  Longueville, the famous Chevalier Bayard, and others of the noblest  blood in France, were among the captives.[133] Ten days after this  defeat Therouanne surrendered; and on the 24th Henry made his      (p. 065)  triumphal entry into the first town captured by English arms since  the days of Jeanne Darc. On the 26th he removed to Guinegate, where he  remained a week, \"according,\" says a curious document, \"to the laws of  arms, for in case any man would bid battle for the besieging and  getting of any city or town, then the winner (has) to give battle, and  to abide the same certain days\".[134] No challenge was forthcoming,  and on 15th September Henry besieged Tournay, then said to be the  richest city north of Paris. During the progress of the siege the Lady  Margaret of Savoy, the Regent of the Netherlands, joined her father,  the Emperor, and Henry, at Lille. They discussed plans for renewing  the war next year and for the marriage of Charles and Mary. To please  the Lady Margaret and to exhibit his skill Henry played the gitteron,  the lute and the cornet, and danced and jousted before her.[135] He  \"excelled every one as much in agility in breaking spears as in  nobleness of stature\". Within a week Tournay fell; on 13th October  Henry commenced his return, and on the 21st he re-embarked at Calais.                       [Footnote 130: _L. and P._, i., 3885, 3915.

Cal_., ii., 328.]    Therouanne, the Battle of Spurs, and Tournay were not the only, or the  most striking, successes in this year of war. In July, Catherine, whom  Henry had left as Regent in England, wrote that she was \"horribly busy  with making standards, banners, and badges\"[136] for the army in the  North; for war with France had brought, as usual, the Scots upon the  English backs. James IV., though Henry's brother-in-law, preferred to  be the cat's paw of the King of France; and in August the Scots  forces poured over the Border under the command of James himself.  (p. 066)  England was prepared; and on 9th September, \"at Flodden hills,\" sang  Skelton, \"our bows and bills slew all the flower of their honour\".  James IV. was left a mutilated corpse upon the field of battle.[137]  \"He has paid,\" wrote Henry, \"a heavier penalty for his perfidy than we  would have wished.\" There was some justice in the charge. James was  bound by treaty not to go to war with England; he had not even waited  for the Pope's answer to his request for absolution from his oath; and  his challenge to Henry, when he was in France and could not meet it,  was not a knightly deed. Henry wrote to Leo for permission to bury the  excommunicated Scottish King with royal honours in St. Paul's.[138]  The permission was granted, but the interment did not take place. In  Italy, Louis fared no better; at Novara, on 6th June, the Swiss  infantry broke in pieces the grand army of France, drove the fragments  across the Alps, and restored the Duchy of Milan to the native house  of Sforza.                       [Footnote 136: _L. and P._, i., 4398; Ellis,                     _Original Letters_, 1st ser., i., 83.]                       [Footnote 137: _L. and P._, i., 4439, 4441, 4461;                     _cf._ popular ballads in Weber's _Flodden Field_,                     and _La Rotta de Scocese_ (Bannatyne Club).]                       [Footnote 138: _Ven.

Cal._,                     i., 137; _L. and P._, i., 4502, 4582.]           *       *       *       *       *    The results of the campaign of 1513 were a striking vindication of the  refusal of Henry VIII. and Wolsey to rest under the stigma of their  Spanish expedition of 1512. English prestige was not only restored,  but raised higher than it had stood since the death of Henry V., whose  \"name,\" said Pasqualigo, a Venetian in London, \"Henry VIII. would now  renew\". He styled him \"our great King\".[139] Peter Martyr, a resident  at Ferdinand's Court, declared that the Spanish King was \"afraid   (p. 067)  of the over-growing power of England\".[140] Another Venetian in London  reported that \"were Henry ambitious of dominion like others, he would  soon give law to the world\". But, he added, \"he is good and has a good  council. His quarrel was a just one, he marched to free the Church, to  obtain his own, and to liberate Italy from the French.\"[141] The pomp  and parade of Henry's wars have, indeed, somewhat obscured the  fundamentally pacific character of his reign. The correspondence of  the time bears constant witness to the peaceful tendencies of Henry  and his council. \"I content myself,\" he once said to Giustinian, \"with  my own, I only wish to command my own subjects; but, on the other  hand, I do not choose that any one shall have it in his power to  command me.\"[142] On another occasion he said: \"We want all potentates  to content themselves with their own territories; we are content with  this island of ours\"; and Giustinian, after four years' residence at  Henry's Court, gave it as his deliberate opinion to his Government,  that Henry did not covet his neighbours' goods, was satisfied with his  own dominions, and \"extremely desirous of peace\".[143] Ferdinand said,  in 1513, that his pensions from France and a free hand in Scotland  were all that Henry really desired;[144] and Carroz, his ambassador,  reported that Henry's councillors did not like to be at war with any  one.[145] Peace, they told Badoer, suited England better than  war.[146]                       [Footnote 139: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 340.]                       [Footnote 140: _L. and P._, i., 4864.]                       [Footnote 141: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 362.]                       [Footnote 142: _L. and P._, ii., 1991.]                       [Footnote 143: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287; Giustinian,                     _Desp._, App., ii., 309.]                       [Footnote 144: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 142.]                       [Footnote 145: _Ib._, ii., 201.]                       [Footnote 146: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 298; _cf. L. and                     P._, i., 3081.]    But Henry's actions proclaimed louder than the words of himself    (p. 068)  or of others that he believed peace to be the first of English interests.  He waged no wars on the continent except against France; and though he  reigned thirty-eight years, his hostilities with France were compressed  into as many months. The campaigns of 1512-13, Surrey's and Suffolk's  inroads of 1522 and 1523, and Henry's invasion of 1544, represent the  sum of his military operations outside Great Britain and Ireland. He  acquired Tournay in 1513 and Boulogne in 1544, but the one was  restored in five years for an indemnity, and the other was to be given  back in eight for a similar consideration. These facts are in curious  contrast with the high-sounding schemes of recovering the crown of  France, which others were always suggesting to Henry, and which he,  for merely conventional reasons, was in the habit of enunciating  before going to war; and in view of the tenacity which Henry exhibited  in other respects, and the readiness with which he relinquished his  regal pretensions to France, it is difficult to believe that they were  any real expression of settled policy. They were, indeed, impossible  of achievement, and Henry saw the fact clearly enough.[147] Modern  phenomena such as huge armies sweeping over Europe, and capitals from  Berlin to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#14)"],[1,"Only.    Jean Paul, inspired by Jean Jacques, was the inspirer of the whole brood  of young writers of his time. To him they looked as to a Deliverer.  Jean Paul the Only! The largest, gentlest, most generous heart in all  literature! The peculiar mark of Richter's style is analogy and  comparison; everything he saw reminded him of something else, and then  he tells you of things of which both remind him. He leads and lures you  on, and takes you far from home, but always brings you safely back. Yet  comparison proves us false when we deal with Richter himself. He stands  alone, like Adam's recollection of his fall, which according to Jean  Paul was the one sweet, unforgetable thing in all the life of the First  Citizen of his time.    Jean Paul seems to have combined in that mighty brain all feminine as  well as masculine attributes. The soul in which the feminine does not  mingle is ripe for wrong, strife and unreason. \"It was mother-love,  carried one step further, that enabled the Savior to embrace a world,\"  says Carlyle.    The sweep of tender emotion that murmurs and rustles through the writing  of Jean Paul is like the echo of a lullaby heard in a dream. Perhaps it  came from that long partnership when mother and son held the siege  against poverty, and the kitchen-table served them as a writing-desk,  and the patient old mother was his sole reviewer, critic, reader and  public.    For shams, hypocrisy and pretense Jean Paul had a cyclone of sarcasm,  and the blows he struck were such as only a son of Anak could give; but  in his heart there was no hate. He could despise a man's bad habits and  still love the man behind the veneer of folly. So his arms seem ever  extended, welcoming the wanderer home.    Dear Jean Paul, big and homely, what an insight you had into the heart  of things, and what a flying-machine your imagination was! Room for many  passengers? Yes, and children especially, for these you loved most of  all, because you were ever only just a big overgrown boy yourself. You  cried your eyes out before your hair grew white, and then a child or a  woman led you about; and thus did you supply Victor Hugo a saying that  can not die: \"To be blind and to be loved--what happier fate!\"    Yes, Jean Paul used to cry at his work when he wrote well, and I do,  too. I always know when I write particularly well, for at such times I  mop furiously. However, I seldom mop.    Robert Schumann began to write little essays, and the essays were as  near like Jean Paul's as he could make them. He read them to his mother,  just as Jean Paul used to write for his mother and call her \"my Gentle  Reader\"--he had but one.    Robert's mother believed in her boy--what mother does not? But her love  was not tempered by reason, and in it there was a sentimental flavor  akin to the maudlin.    The father wanted the lad to take up his own business, as German fathers  do, but the mother filled the lad's head with the thought that he was  fit for something higher and better. She was not willing to let the  seed ripen in Nature's way--she thought hothouse methods were an  improvement.    Such a mother's ambition centers in her son. She wants him to do the  thing she has never been able to do. She thirsts for honors, applause,  publicity, and all those things that bring trouble and distress and make  men old before their time.    So we find the boy at eighteen packed off to Heidelberg to study law,  with no special preparation in knowledge of the world, of men or books.  But old father antic, the law, was not to his taste. Robert liked music  and poetry better. His fine, sensitive, emotional spirit found its best  exercise in music; and at the house of Professor Carus he used to sing  with the professor's wife. This Professor Carus, by the way, is, I  believe, directly related to our own Doctor Paul Carus, of whom all  thinking people in America have reason to be proud. I am told that when  a boy of eighteen or nineteen mingles his voice several evenings a week  with that of a married lady aged, say, thirty-five, and they also play  \"four hands\" an hour or so a day, that the boy is apt to surprise the  married lady by falling very much in love with her. Boys are quite given  to this thing, anyway, of falling in love with women old enough to be  their mothers--I don't know why it is. Sometimes I am rather inclined to  commend the scheme, since it often brings good results. The fact that  the woman's emotions are well tempered with a sort of maternal regard  for her charge holds folly in check, dispels that tired feeling,  promotes digestion, and stimulates the action of the ganglionic cells.    It was surely so in this instance, for Madame Carus taught the youth how  to compose, and fired his mind to excel as a pianist. He wrote and  dedicated small songs to her, and their relationship added cubits to the  boy's stature.    From a boy he became a man at a bound. Just as one single April day,  with its showers and sunshine, will transform the seemingly lifeless  twigs into leafy branches, so did this young man's intellect ripen in  the sunshine of love.    As for Professor Carus, he was too busy with his theorems and biological  experiments to trouble himself about so trivial a matter as a youngster  falling in love with his accomplished wife--here the Professor's good  sense was shown.    Jean Paul Richter lighted his torch at the flame of Jean Jacques  Rousseau. In a letter to Agnes Carus, Schumann has acknowledged his  obligation to Richter, in a style that is truly Richteresque.    Says Robert:         Dear Lady:--I read from Jean Paul last night until I fell asleep       and then I dreamed of you. It was at the torch of Jean Paul that I       lighted my tallow dip, and now he is dead and these eyes shall       never look into his, nor will his voice fall upon my ears. I cry       salt tears to think that Jean Paul never knew you. If I could only       have brought you two together and then looked upon you, realizing,       as I would, that you had both come from High Olympus! Blissful are       the days since I knew you, for you have brought within my range of       vision new constellations, and into my soul has come the clear,       white light of peace and truth. With you I am purified, freed from       sin, and harmony fills my tired heart. Without you--why, really I       have never dared think about it, for fear that reason would topple,       and my mind forget its 'customed way--let's talk of music. * * *    Professor Carus kept his ear close to the ground for a higher call, and  when the call came from Leipzig, he moved there with his family.    It was not many weeks before Robert was writing home, explaining that  lawyers were men who get good people into trouble, and bad folks out;  and as for himself he had decided to cut the business and fling himself  into the arms of the Muse.    This letter brought his mother down upon him with tears and pleadings  that he would not fail to redeem the Schumanns by becoming a Great Man.  Poetry was foolishness and all musicians were poor--there were a hundred  of them in Zwickau who lived on rye-bread and wienerwurst.    The boy promised and the mother went home pacified. But not many weeks  had passed before Robert set out on a pilgrimage to Bayreuth, to visit  the scene of Jean Paul's romances. On this same tour he went to Munich,  and there met Heinrich Heine, who was from that day to enter into his  heart and jostle Jean Paul for first place. He was accompanied on this  memorable trip by Gisbert Rosen, who proved his lifelong friend and  confidant. Very naturally Leipzig was the ardently desired goal of his  wanderings. At once on arriving there, he sought out the home of  Professor and Madame Carus. That his greeting (and mayhap hers) did not  contain all the warmth the boy lover had anticipated is shown in a  letter to Rosen, wherein he says: \"This world is only a huge graveyard  of buried dreams, a garden of cypress and weeping willows, a silent  peep-show with tearful puppets. Alas for our high faith--I wonder if  Jean Paul wasn't right when he said that love lessens woman's delicacy,  and time and distance dissipate it like morning dew?\"    Yet Madame Carus was kind, for Robert played at little informal concerts  at her house, and she urged him to abandon law for music; and he refers  the matter to Rosen, asking Rosen's advice and explaining how he wants  to be advised, just as we usually do. Rosen tells him that no man can  succeed at an undertaking unless his heart is in the work, and so he  shifts the responsibility of deciding on Professor Carus, whom Robert  \"respects,\" but does not exactly admire enough to follow his advice.    Robert does not consider the Professor a practical man, and so leaves  the matter to his wife. In the meantime songs are written similar to  Heine's, and essays turned off, pinned with the precise synonym, the  phrase exquisite, just like Jean Paul's. Progress in piano-playing goes  steadily forward, with practise on the violin, all under the tutelage of  Madame Carus, who one fine day takes the young man to play for Frederick  Wieck, the best music-teacher in Leipzig.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Musicians?\" said Wieck, \"I raise them!\"    And so he did. He proved the value of his theories by making great  performers of Maria and Clara, his daughters--two sisters more gifted in  a musical way have never been born. Germany excels in philosophy and  music--a seeming paradox. Music is supposed to be a compound of the  stuff that dreams are made of--hazy, misty, dim, intangible feelings set  to sounds--we close our eyes and they take us captive and carry us away  on the wings of melody. And so it may be true that music is born of  moonshine, and fragrant memories, and hopes too great for earth, and  loves unrealized; yet its expression is the most exacting of sciences.
