Many English men and      women were present and put questions which were answered in a      conclusive manner. At the close of the meeting a young lady of      good family embraced Islam and was named Maimuna.\"    Then we have the scholarly and temperate addresses of Seyid Muhammad  Rauf and others before the Islamic Society in London; they are marked by  considerable shrewdness and breadth of view, and though their debatable  points may present a few fallacies, their effective controversion  requires unusual knowledge of affairs in Moslem countries.    It is not, however, the activities of Moslems in England which damage  the prestige of Christendom; it is the behaviour of English alleged  Christians themselves. Every missionary, political officer, tutor, or  even the importer of a native servant--in short, anyone who has been  responsible for an oriental in England--knows what I mean. I do not say  that London (for example) is any more vicious than Delhi or Cairo or  Cabul or Constantinople or any other large Moslem centre, but vice is  certainly more obvious in London to the casual observer, even allowing  for the fact that many comparatively harmless customs of ours (such as  women wearing low-necked dresses and dancing with men) are apt to shock  Moslems until they learn that occidental habit has created an atmosphere  of innocence in such cases which even bunny-hugging has failed to  vitiate.    The social life of London in all its grades and phases operates more  widely for good or ill on Christian prestige among Moslems than  Londoners can possibly imagine. From the young princeling of some native  State sauntering about Clubland with his bear-leader to the lascar off a  P. and O. boat, among East London drabs, or the middle-class Mohammedan  student who compares the civic achievements that surround him with the  dingy dining-room of a Bloomsbury boarding-house, all are apostles of  life in London as it seems to them. I have had the hospitality of  \"family hotels\" in the Euston Road portrayed to me in the crude but  vivid imagery of the East when spooring boar in Southern Morocco with a  native tracker who had been one of a troupe of Soosi jugglers earning  good pay at a West-end music-hall, and I once overheard a young  _effendi_ explaining to his _confreres_ in a Cairo cafe exactly the sort  of company that would board your hansom when leaving \"Jimmy's\" in days  of yore.    As for the news of London and its ways, as conveyed by its daily Press,  educated Egyptians were better posted therein than most Englishmen in  Cairo during the War, as their clubs and private organisations  subscribed largely to the London dailies, which entered Egypt free of  local censorship, while Anglo-Egyptian newspapers were more strictly  censored than their vernacular or continental contemporaries, as they  presented no linguistic difficulties, but could be dealt with direct and  not through an understrapper.    Missionaries would have us judge Islam by the open improprieties and  abuses which occur at Mecca, Kerbela, and other great Moslem centres.  How should we like Christianity to be judged by the public behaviour of  certain classes in London or other big towns? Remember, it is always the  scum which floats on top and the superficial vice or indecorum that  strike a foreign observer.    It is not my mission to preach--I am merely pointing out a flaw in our  harness which causes a lot of administrative trouble out East. It is  difficult to check the hashish habit in Egypt when the average educated  _effendi_ reads of drug-scandals in London with mischievous avidity, and  the endeavours of a well-meaning Education Department to implant ideals  of sturdy manhood are handicapped when the students batten on the weird  and unsavoury incidents which are dished up _in extenso_ by London  journalism from time to time. Such matters do no harm to a public with  a sense of proportion, but the _effendi_ is in the position of a  schoolboy who has caught his master tripping and means to make the most  of it. He assimilates and disseminates the idea that cocaine is as  easily procurable as a cocktail in London clubs, and that the Black Mass  is at least as common as the _danse de ventre_ in Cairo.    We can leave England for our Eastern tour with the conclusion that Islam  is welcome to any proselytes it makes there, but that the gravest slur  on Christian prestige is cast by our own conduct.    There is only one bone of contention between Moslems and missionaries in  Europe now that Turkey and Russia are knocked out of the ring of current  politics. Is St. Sophia to remain a mosque or revert to its original  purpose as a Christian church? Whatever may be Turkish opinion on the  subject, the tradition of Islam is definite enough. When the Caliph Omar  entered Jerusalem in triumph, after Khaled had defeated the hosts of  Heraclius east of Jordan, he withstood the importunate entreaties of his  followers to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, saying that if he  did so the building would _de facto_ become a mosque, and such a wrong  to Christianity was against the ordinance and procedure of the Prophet.  It is worthy of note that Christians were not molested at Jerusalem  until after the Seljouk Turks wrested the Holy City from the moribund  Arabian Caliphate in 1076: their persecution and the desecration of  sacred places by the Turks brought about the first Crusade in 1096.  Again it was the Ottoman Turks who stormed Constantinople and turned  St. Sophia into a mosque. According to the orthodox tradition of Islam,  once a church always a church. When the ex-Khedive had the chance of  reacquiring the site of All Saints', Cairo, owing to the increasing  noise of traffic in the vicinity, he contemplated building a  cinema-theatre there (for he had a shrewd business mind), but he was  roundly told by Moslem legalists that it was out of the question. Even  if the Turks urge right of conquest, victorious Christendom can claim  that too, and if they allege length of tenure as a mosque in support of  their case they put themselves out of court, as St. Sophia has been a  church for more than nine centuries and a mosque for less than five.    If Turkey is allowed to remain in Europe at all it will be on  sufferance. Even in Asia Minor signs are not wanting that Turkish rule  will be pruned, clipped and trained considerably, as humanity will stand  its rampant luxuriance of blood and barbarity no longer. The Young  Turks were given every chance to consolidate their national aspirations  and have achieved national suicide. One may feel sorry for the patient,  sturdy peasantry and the non-political cultured classes who have been  coerced or cajoled into fighting desperately in a cause that meant  calamity for them whether they won or lost; but a nation gets the rulers  it deserves and must answer for their acts.    Asia Minor will probably be more accessible as a mission-field in due  course. The Moslem Turk is not amenable to conversion; in fact, during a  quarter of a century's wandering in the East I have never met a Turkish  convert. The American Protestant Mission will probably be well to the  fore in this area in view of its excellent work on behalf of the  Armenians and other distressed Christians during the War. Just as it has  concentrated its principal energies on the Copts in Egypt, so it may  with advantage devote itself to the education and \"uplift\" of the  Armenians, and if its activities are as successful as with the Copts,  even the Armenians cannot but approve, for the more enlightened  individuals of that harassed and harassing little nation admit that the  Armenian character could be considerably improved, and that, though  their hideous persecution is indefensibly damnable, their covetous  instincts and parasitic activities are an incentive to maltreatment.    One of the most difficult minor problems of reconstruction in Eastern  Europe and Asia Minor will be how to safeguard the interests and modify  the provocative activities of such subject-races as the Jews and the  Armenians where established among ill-controlled nations and numerically  inferior, though intellectually superior, to them. With their natural  gift for intrigue and finance, they repay public persecution and  oppression by undermining the administration and battening on the  resources of their unwilling foster-country until active dislike becomes  actual violence and outbursts of brutish rage yield ghastly results.  Deportation is not only tyrannically harsh but impracticable, for unless  they were dumped to die in the waste places of the earth, which is  unthinkable, some other nation must receive them, and even the most  philanthropic Government would hesitate to upset its economic conditions  by admitting unproductive hordes of sweated labour and skilled  exploiters. There are only two logical alternatives to such an  _impasse_. One is to treat such subject-races so well that they may be  trusted not to use their peculiar abilities against the interests of  their adoptive country, which would then be their interests too, and  the other is to exterminate them, which is inhuman. There is no middle  course.    It is a salutary but humiliating fact that we incur the worst human ills  by our lack of human charity. We starved and over-crowded our poor till  they bred consumption, and we enslaved negroes till they degenerated our  Anglo-Saxon sturdiness of character, then plunged a great nation into  civil war, and have finally become one of its most serious social  problems.

She had a good idea of what was  coming, and the moment York took the rein off the terret in order to  shorten it she took her opportunity and reared up so suddenly that York  had his nose roughly hit and his hat knocked off; the groom was nearly  thrown off his legs. At once they both flew to her head; but she was  a match for them, and went on plunging, rearing, and kicking in a most  desperate manner. At last she kicked right over the carriage pole and  fell down, after giving me a severe blow on my near quarter. There is no  knowing what further mischief she might have done had not York promptly  sat himself down flat on her head to prevent her struggling, at the  same time calling out, \"Unbuckle the black horse! Run for the winch and  unscrew the carriage pole! Cut the trace here, somebody, if you can't  unhitch it!\" One of the footmen ran for the winch, and another brought  a knife from the house. The groom soon set me free from Ginger and the  carriage, and led me to my box. He just turned me in as I was and ran  back to York. I was much excited by what had happened, and if I had ever  been used to kick or rear I am sure I should have done it then; but  I never had, and there I stood, angry, sore in my leg, my head still  strained up to the terret on the saddle, and no power to get it down. I  was very miserable and felt much inclined to kick the first person who  came near me.    Before long, however, Ginger was led in by two grooms, a good deal  knocked about and bruised. York came with her and gave his orders, and  then came to look at me. In a moment he let down my head.    \"Confound these check-reins!\" he said to himself; \"I thought we should  have some mischief soon. Master will be sorely vexed. But there, if a  woman's husband can't rule her of course a servant can't; so I wash my  hands of it, and if she can't get to the duchess' garden party I can't  help it.\"    York did not say this before the men; he always spoke respectfully when  they were by. Now he felt me all over, and soon found the place above my  hock where I had been kicked. It was swelled and painful; he ordered it  to be sponged with hot water, and then some lotion was put on.    Lord W---- was much put out when he learned what had happened; he blamed  York for giving way to his mistress, to which he replied that in future  he would much prefer to receive his orders only from his lordship; but  I think nothing came of it, for things went on the same as before. I  thought York might have stood up better for his horses, but perhaps I am  no judge.    Ginger was never put into the carriage again, but when she was well of  her bruises one of the Lord W----'s younger sons said he should like  to have her; he was sure she would make a good hunter. As for me, I was  obliged still to go in the carriage, and had a fresh partner called Max;  he had always been used to the tight rein. I asked him how it was he  bore it.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I bear it because I must; but it is shortening my  life, and it will shorten yours too if you have to stick to it.\"    \"Do you think,\" I said, \"that our masters know how bad it is for us?\"    \"I can't say,\" he replied, \"but the dealers and the horse-doctors know  it very well. I was at a dealer's once, who was training me and another  horse to go as a pair; he was getting our heads up, as he said, a little  higher and a little higher every day. A gentleman who was there asked  him why he did so. 'Because,' said he, 'people won't buy them unless we  do. The London people always want their horses to carry their heads high  and to step high. Of course it is very bad for the horses, but then it  is good for trade. The horses soon wear up, or get diseased, and they  come for another pair.' That,\" said Max, \"is what he said in my hearing,  and you can judge for yourself.\"    What I suffered with that rein for four long months in my lady's  carriage it would be hard to describe; but I am quite sure that, had it  lasted much longer, either my health or my temper would have given way.  Before that, I never knew what it was to foam at the mouth, but now  the action of the sharp bit on my tongue and jaw, and the constrained  position of my head and throat, always caused me to froth at the mouth  more or less. Some people think it very fine to see this, and say, \"What  fine spirited creatures!\" But it is just as unnatural for horses as  for men to foam at the mouth; it is a sure sign of some discomfort,  and should be attended to. Besides this, there was a pressure on my  windpipe, which often made my breathing very uncomfortable; when I  returned from my work my neck and chest were strained and painful, my  mouth and tongue tender, and I felt worn and depressed.    In my old home I always knew that John and my master were my friends;  but here, although in many ways I was well treated, I had no friend.  York might have known, and very likely did know, how that rein harassed  me; but I suppose he took it as a matter of course that it could not be  helped; at any rate, nothing was done to relieve me.          24 The Lady Anne, or a Runaway Horse      Early in the spring, Lord W---- and part of his family went up to  London, and took York with them. I and Ginger and some other horses were  left at home for use, and the head groom was left in charge.    The Lady Harriet, who remained at the hall, was a great invalid, and  never went out in the carriage, and the Lady Anne preferred riding on  horseback with her brother or cousins. She was a perfect horsewoman, and  as gay and gentle as she was beautiful. She chose me for her horse, and  named me \"Black Auster\". I enjoyed these rides very much in the clear  cold air, sometimes with Ginger, sometimes with Lizzie. This Lizzie was  a bright bay mare, almost thoroughbred, and a great favorite with the  gentlemen, on account of her fine action and lively spirit; but Ginger,  who knew more of her than I did, told me she was rather nervous.    There was a gentleman of the name of Blantyre staying at the hall;  he always rode Lizzie, and praised her so much that one day Lady Anne  ordered the side-saddle to be put on her, and the other saddle on me.  When we came to the door the gentleman seemed very uneasy.    \"How is this?\" he said. \"Are you tired of your good Black Auster?\"    \"Oh, no, not at all,\" she replied, \"but I am amiable enough to let you  ride him for once, and I will try your charming Lizzie. You must confess  that in size and appearance she is far more like a lady's horse than my  own favorite.\"    \"Do let me advise you not to mount her,\" he said; \"she is a charming  creature, but she is too nervous for a lady. I assure you, she is not  perfectly safe; let me beg you to have the saddles changed.\"    \"My dear cousin,\" said Lady Anne, laughing, \"pray do not trouble your  good careful head about me. I have been a horsewoman ever since I was a  baby, and I have followed the hounds a great many times, though I know  you do not approve of ladies hunting; but still that is the fact, and  I intend to try this Lizzie that you gentlemen are all so fond of; so  please help me to mount, like a good friend as you are.\"    There was no more to be said; he placed her carefully on the saddle,  looked to the bit and curb, gave the reins gently into her hand, and  then mounted me. Just as we were moving off a footman came out with a  slip of paper and message from the Lady Harriet. \"Would they ask this  question for her at Dr. Ashley's, and bring the answer?\"    The village was about a mile off, and the doctor's house was the last  in it. We went along gayly enough till we came to his gate. There was a  short drive up to the house between tall evergreens.    Blantyre alighted at the gate, and was going to open it for Lady Anne,  but she said, \"I will wait for you here, and you can hang Auster's rein  on the gate.\"    He looked at her doubtfully. \"I will not be five minutes,\" he said.    \"Oh, do not hurry yourself; Lizzie and I shall not run away from you.\"    He hung my rein on one of the iron spikes, and was soon hidden among the  trees. Lizzie was standing quietly by the side of the road a few paces  off, with her back to me. My young mistress was sitting easily with a  loose rein, humming a little song. I listened to my rider's footsteps  until they reached the house, and heard him knock at the door. There was  a meadow on the opposite side of the road, the gate of which stood open;  just then some cart horses and several young colts came trotting out in  a very disorderly manner, while a boy behind was cracking a great whip.  The colts were wild and frolicsome, and one of them bolted across the  road and blundered up against Lizzie's hind legs, and whether it was  the stupid colt, or the loud cracking of the whip, or both together, I  cannot say, but she gave a violent kick, and dashed off into a headlong  gallop. It was so sudden that Lady Anne was nearly unseated, but she  soon recovered herself. I gave a loud, shrill neigh for help; again and  again I neighed, pawing the ground impatiently, and tossing my head to  get the rein loose. I had not long to wait. Blantyre came running to  the gate; he looked anxiously about, and just caught sight of the flying  figure, now far away on the road. In an instant he sprang to the saddle.  I needed no whip, no spur, for I was as eager as my rider; he saw it,  and giving me a free rein, and leaning a little forward, we dashed after  them.    For about a mile and a half the road ran straight, and then bent to the  right, after which it divided into two roads. Long before we came to  the bend she was out of sight. Which way had she turned? A woman was  standing at her garden gate, shading her eyes with her hand, and looking  eagerly up the road. Scarcely drawing the rein, Blantyre shouted, \"Which  way?\" \"To the right!\" cried the"]]]
