[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#14)"],[1,"r, I passed out into the noise of  Waterloo Road, I left behind me an unsolved mystery and took with  me a great dread; for I knew that the quest of the sacred slipper  was not ended, I knew that another tragedy was added to its history--and  I feared to surmise what the future might hold for all of us.          CHAPTER XVII    THE WOMAN WITH THE BASKET      Deep in thought respecting the inexplicable nature of this latest  mystery, I turned in the direction of the bridge, and leaving behind  me an ever-swelling throng at the gate of Wyatt's Buildings,  proceeded westward.    The death of the dwarf had lifted the case into the realms of the  marvellous, and I noted nothing of the bustle about me, for mentally  I was still surveying that hunched-up body which had fallen out of  empty space.    Then in upon my preoccupation burst a woman's scream!    I aroused myself from reverie, looking about to right and left.  Evidently I had been walking slowly, for I was less than a hundred  yards from Wyatt's Buildings, and hard by the entrance to an  uninviting alley from which I thought the scream had proceeded.    And as I hesitated, for I had no desire to become involved in a  drunken brawl, again came the shrill scream: \"Help!  help!\"    I cannot say if I was the only passer-by who heard the cry;  certainly I was the only one who responded to it.  I ran down the  narrow street, which was practically deserted, and heard windows  thrown up as I passed for the cries for help continued.    Just beyond a patch of light cast by a street lamp a scene was being  enacted strange enough at any time and in any place, but doubly  singular at that hour of the night, or early morning, in a lane off  the Waterloo Road.    An old woman, from whose hand a basket of provisions had fallen,  was struggling in the grasp of a tall Oriental!  He was evidently  trying to stifle her screams and at the same time to pinion her  arms behind her!    I perceived that there was more in this scene than met the eye.  Oriental footpads are rarities in the purlieus of Waterloo Road.  So much was evident; and since I carried a short, sharp argument in  my pocket, I hastened to advance it.    At the sight of the gleaming revolver barrel the man, who was  dressed in dark clothes and wore a turban, turned and ran swiftly  off.  I had scarce a glimpse of his pallid brown face ere he was  gone, nor did the thought of pursuit enter my mind.  I turned to  the old woman, who was dressed in shabby black and who was  rearranging her thick veil in an oddly composed manner, considering  the nature of the adventure that had befallen her.    She picked up her basket, and turned away.  Needless to say I was  rather shocked at her callous ingratitude, for she offered no word of  thanks, did not even glance in my direction, but made off hurriedly  toward Waterloo Road.    I had been on the point of inquiring if she had sustained any injury,  but I checked the words and stood looking after her in blank  wonderment.  Then my ideas were diverted into a new channel.  I  perceived, as she passed under an adjacent lamp, that her basket  contained provisions such as a woman of her appearance would scarcely  be expected to purchase.  I noted a bottle of wine, a chicken, and a  large melon.    The nationality of the assailant from the first had marked the affair  for no ordinary one, and now a hazy notion of what lay behind all  this began to come to me.    Keeping well in the shadows on the opposite side of the way, I  followed the woman with the basket.  The lane was quite deserted;  for, the disturbance over, those few residents who had raised their  windows had promptly lowered them again.  She came out into  Waterloo Road, crossed over, and stood waiting by a stopping-place  for electric cars.  I saw her arranging a cloth over her basket in  such a way as effectually to conceal the contents.  A strong mental  excitement possessed me.  The detective fever claims us all at one  time or another, I think, and I had good reason for pursuing any  inquiry that promised to lead to the elucidation of the slipper  mystery.  A theory, covering all the facts of the assault incident,  now presented itself, and I stood back in the shadow, watchful; in  a degree, exultant.    A Greenwich-bound car was hailed by the woman with the basket.  I  could not be mistaken, I felt sure, in my belief that she cast  furtive glances about her as she mounted the steps.  But, having  seen her actually aboard, my attention became elsewhere engaged.    All now depended upon securing a cab before the tram car had  passed from view!    I counted it an act of Providence that a disengaged taxi appeared  at that moment, evidently bound for Waterloo Station.  I ran out  into the road with cane upraised.    As the man drew up--    \"Quick!\" I cried.  \"You see that Greenwich car--nearly at the  Ophthalmic Hospital?  Follow it.  Don't get too near.  I will give  you further instructions through the tube.\"  I leapt in.  We were  off!    The rocking car ahead was rounding the bend now toward St. George's  Circus.  As it passed the clock and entered South London Road it  stopped.  I raised the tube.    \"Pass it slowly!\"    We skirted the clock tower, and bore around to the right.  Then I  drew well back in the corner of the cab.    The woman with the basket was descending!  \"Pull up a few yards  beyond!\" I directed.  As the car re-started, and passed us, the  taxi became stationary.  I peered out of the little window at the  back.    The woman was returning in the direction of Waterloo Road!    \"Drive slowly back along Waterloo Road,\" was my next order.  \"Pretend you are looking for a fare; I will keep out of sight.\"    The man nodded.  It was unlikely that any one would notice the  fact that the cab was engaged.    I was borne back again upon my course.  The woman kept to the right,  and, once we were entered into the straight road which leads to the  bridge, I again raised the speaking-tube.    \"Pull up,\" I said.  \"On the right-hand side is an old woman carrying  a basket, fifty yards ahead.  Do you see her?  Keep well behind, but  don't lose sight of her.\"    The man drew up again and sat watching the figure with the basket  until it was almost lost from sight.  Then slowly we resumed our  way.  I would have continued the pursuit afoot now, but I feared  that my quarry might again enter a vehicle.  She did not do so,  however, but coming abreast of the turning in which the mysterious  assault had taken place, she crossed the road and disappeared from  view.    I leapt out of the cab, thrust half a crown into the man's hand,  and ran on to the corner.  The night was now far advanced, and I  knew that the chances of detection were thereby increased.  But  the woman seemed to have abandoned her fears, and I saw her just  ahead of me walking resolutely past the lamp beyond which a short  time earlier she had met with a dangerous adventure.    Since the opposite side of the street was comparatively in darkness,  I slipped across, and in a state of high nervous tension pursued  this strange work of espionage.  I was convinced that I had  forestalled Bristol and that I was hot upon the track of those who  could explain the mystery of the dead dwarf.    The woman entered the gate of the block of dwellings even more  forbidding in appearance than those which that night had staged  a dreadful drama.    As the figure with the basket was lost from view I crept on, and  in turn entered the evil-smelling hallway.  I stepped cautiously,  and standing beneath a gaslight protected by a wire frame, I  congratulated myself upon having reached that point of vantage as  silently as any Sioux stalker.    Footsteps were receding up the stone stairs.  Craning my neck, I  peered up the well of the staircase.  I could not see the woman,  but from the sound of her tread it was possible to count the  landings which she passed.  When she had reached the fourth, and I  heard her step upon yet another flight, I knew that she must be  bound for the topmost floor; and observing every precaution, almost  holding my breath in a nervous endeavour to make not the slightest  sound, rapidly I mounted the stairs.    I was come to the third landing in this secret fashion when quite  distinctly I heard the grating of a key in a lock!    Since four doors opened upon each of the landings, at all costs,  I thought, I must learn by which door she entered.    Throwing caution to the winds I raced up the remaining flights ...  and there at the top the woman confronted me, with blazing eyes!--with  eyes that thrilled every nerve; for they were violet eyes, the  only truly violet eyes I have ever seen!  They were the eyes of the  woman who like a charming, mocking will-o'-the-wisp had danced  through this tragic scene from the time that poor Professor Deeping  had brought the Prophet's slipper to London up to this present hour!    There at the head of those stone steps in that common dwelling-house  I knew her--and in the violet eyes it was written that she knew,  and feared, me!    \"What do you want?  Why are you following me?\"    She made no endeavour to disguise her voice.  Almost, I think, she  spoke the words involuntarily.    I stood beside her.  Quickly as she had turned from the door at my  ascent, I had noted that it was that numbered forty-eight which she  had been about to open.    \"You waste words,\" I said grimly.  \"Who lives there?\"    I nodded in the direction of the doorway.  The violet eyes watched  me with an expression in their depths which I find myself wholly  unable to describe.  Fear predominated, but there was anger, too,  and with it a sort of entreaty which almost made me regret that I  had taken this task upon myself.  From beneath the shabby black hat  escaped an errant lock of wavy hair wholly inconsistent with the  assumed appearance of the woman.

Here  is Farfrae, the young Scotchman, in the tap-room of the Three Mariners  Inn of Casterbridge, singing of his ain contree with a pathos quite  unknown in that part of the world. The worthies who frequent the place  are deeply moved. 'Danged if our country down here is worth singing  about like that,' says Billy Wills, the glazier,--while the literal  Christopher Coney inquires, 'What did ye come away from yer own  country for, young maister, if ye be so wownded about it?' Then it  occurs to him that it wasn't worth Farfrae's while to leave the fair  face and the home of which he had been singing to come among such as  they. 'We be bruckle folk here--the best o' us hardly honest  sometimes, what with hard winters, and so many mouths to fill, and  God-a'mighty sending his little taties so terrible small to fill 'em  with. We don't think about flowers and fair faces, not we--except in  the shape of cauliflowers and pigs' chaps.'    I should like to see the man who sat to Artist Hardy for the portrait  of Corporal Tullidge in _The Trumpet-Major_. This worthy, who was deaf  and talked in an uncompromisingly loud voice, had been struck in the  head by a piece of shell at Valenciennes in '93. His left arm had been  smashed. Time and Nature had done what they could, and under their  beneficent influences the arm had become a sort of anatomical  rattle-box. People interested in Corp'el Tullidge were allowed to see  his head and hear his arm. The corp'el gave these private views at any  time, and was quite willing to show off, though the exhibition was apt  to bore him a little. His fellows displayed him much as one would a  'freak' in a dime museum.    'You have got a silver plate let into yer head, haven't ye, corp'el?'  said Anthony Cripplestraw. 'I have heard that the way they mortised  yer skull was a beautiful piece of workmanship. Perhaps the young  woman would like to see the place.'    The young woman was Anne Garland, the sweet heroine of the story; and  Anne didn't want to see the silver plate, the thought of which made  her almost faint. Nor could she be tempted by being told that one  couldn't see such a 'wownd' every day. Then Cripplestraw, earnest to  please her, suggested that Tullidge rattle his arm, which Tullidge  did, to Anne's great distress.    'Oh, it don't hurt him, bless ye. Do it, corp'el?' said Cripplestraw.    'Not a bit,' said the corporal, still working his arm with great  energy. There was, however, a perfunctoriness in his manner 'as if the  glory of exhibition had lost somewhat of its novelty, though he was  still willing to oblige.' Anne resisted all entreaties to convince  herself by feeling of the corporal's arm that the bones were 'as loose  as a bag of ninepins,' and displayed an anxiety to escape. Whereupon  the corporal, 'with a sense that his time was getting wasted,'  inquired: 'Do she want to see or hear any more, or don't she?'    This is but a single detail in the account of a party which Miller  Loveday gave to soldier guests in honor of his son John,--a  description the sustained vivacity of which can only be appreciated  through a reading of those brilliant early chapters of the story.    Half the mirth that is in these men comes from the frankness with  which they confess their actual thoughts. Ask a man of average morals  and average attainments why he doesn't go to church. You won't know  any better after he has given you his answer. Ask Nat Chapman, of the  novel entitled _Two on a Tower_, and you will not be troubled with  ambiguities. He doesn't like to go because Mr. Torkingham's sermons  make him think of soul-saving and other bewildering and uncomfortable  topics. So when the son of Torkingham's predecessor asks Nat how it  goes with him, that tiller of the soil answers promptly: 'Pa'son  Tarkenham do tease a feller's conscience that much, that church is no  holler-day at all to the limbs, as it was in yer reverent father's  time!'    The unswerving honesty with which they assign utilitarian motives for  a particular line of conduct is delightful. Three men discuss a  wedding, which took place not at the home of the bride but in a  neighboring parish, and was therefore very private. The first doesn't  blame the new married pair, because 'a wedding at home means five and  six handed reels by the hour, and they do a man's legs no good when  he's over forty.' A second corroborates the remark and says: 'True.  Once at the woman's house you can hardly say nay to being one in a  jig, knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth  your victuals.'    The third puts the whole matter beyond the need of further discussion  by adding: 'For my part, I like a good hearty funeral as well as  anything. You've as splendid victuals and drink as at other parties,  and even better. And it don't wear your legs to stumps in talking over  a poor fellow's ways as it do to stand up in hornpipes.'    Beings who talk like this know their minds,--a rather unwonted  circumstance among the sons of men,--and knowing them, they do the  next most natural thing in the world, which is to speak the minds they  have.    There is yet another phase of Hardy's humor to be noted: that humor,  sometimes defiant, sometimes philosophic, which concerns death and its  accompaniments. It cannot be thought morbid. Hardy is too fond of  Nature ever to degenerate into mere morbidity. He has lived much in  the open air, which always corrects a tendency to 'vapors.' He takes  little pleasure in the gruesome, a statement in support of which one  may cite all his works up to 1892, the date of the appearance of  _Tess_. This paper includes no comment in detail upon the later books;  but so far as _Tess_ is concerned it would be critical folly to speak  of it as morbid. It is sad, it is terrible, as _Lear_ is terrible, or  as any one of the great tragedies, written by men we call 'masters,'  is terrible. _Jude_ is psychologically gruesome, no doubt; but not  absolutely indefensible. Even if it were as black a book as some  critics have painted it, the general truth of the statement as to the  healthfulness of Hardy's work would not be impaired. This work judged  as a whole is sound and invigorating. He cannot be accused of  over-fondness for charnel-houses or ghosts. He does not discourse of  graves and vaults in order to arouse that terror which the thought of  death inspires. It is not for the purpose of making the reader  uncomfortable. If the grave interests him, it is because of the  reflections awakened. 'Man, proud man,' needs that jog to his memory  which the pomp of interments and aspect of tombstones give. Hardy has  keen perception of that humor which glows in the presence of death and  on the edge of the grave. The living have such a tremendous advantage  over the dead, that they can neither help feeling it nor avoid a  display of the feeling. When the lion is buried the dogs crack jokes  at the funeral. They do it in a subdued manner, no doubt, and with a  sense of proprieties, but nevertheless they do it. Their immense  superiority is never so apparent as at just this moment.    This humor, which one notes in Hardy, is akin to the humor of the  grave-diggers in _Hamlet_, but not so grim. I have heard a country  undertaker describe the details of the least attractive branch of his  uncomfortable business with a pride and self-satisfaction that would  have been farcical had not the subject been so depressing. This would  have been matter for Hardy's pen. There are few scenes in his books  more telling than that which shows the operations in the family vault  of the Luxellians, when John Smith, Martin Cannister, and old Simeon  prepare the place for Lady Luxellian's coffin. It seems hardly wise to  pronounce this episode as good as the grave-diggers' scene in  _Hamlet_; that would shock some one and gain for the writer the  reputation of being enthusiastic rather than critical. But I profess  that I enjoy the talk of old Simeon and Martin Cannister quite as much  as the talk of the first and second grave-diggers.    Simeon, the shriveled mason, was 'a marvelously old man, whose skin  seemed so much too large for his body that it would not stay in  position.' He talked of the various great dead whose coffins filled  the family vault. Here was the stately and irascible Lord George:--    'Ah, poor Lord George,' said the mason, looking contemplatively at the  huge coffin; 'he and I were as bitter enemies once as any could be  when one is a lord and t'other only a mortal man. Poor fellow! He'd  clap his hand upon my shoulder and cuss me as familiar and neighborly  as if he'd been a common chap. Ay, 'a cussed me up hill and 'a cussed  me down; and then 'a would rave out again and the goold clamps of his  fine new teeth would glisten in the sun like fetters of brass, while  I, being a small man and poor, was fain to say nothing at all. Such a  strappen fine gentleman as he was too! Yes, I rather liken en  sometimes. But once now and then, when I looked at his towering  height, I'd think in my inside, \"What a weight you'll be, my lord, for  our arms to lower under the inside of Endelstow church some day!\"'    'And was he?' inquired a young laborer.    'He was. He was five hundred weight if 'a were a pound. What with his  lead, and his oak, and his handles, and his one thing and t'other'--here  the ancient man slapped his hand upon the cover with a force that  caused a rattle among the bones inside--'he half broke my back when I  took his feet to lower en down the steps there. \"Ah,\" saith I to John  there--didn't I, John?--\"that ever one man's glory should be such a  weight upon another man!\" But there, I liked my Lord George  sometimes.'    It may be observed that as Hardy grows older his humor becomes more  subtle or quite dies away, as if serious matters pressed upon his  mind, and there was no time for being jocular. Some day, perhaps, "]]]
