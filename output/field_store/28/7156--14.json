[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#14)"],[1,"often means the complete ruin of a stone which is not  genuine. Another characteristic which, in the eyes of the expert,  invariably isolates a real from an artificial ruby is its curious mild  brilliance, which as yet has not been reproduced by any scientific  method in paste or any other material, but perhaps the safest test of  all is the crystalline structure, which identical structure appears in  no other stone, though it is possible, by heating alumina coloured with  oxide of iron and perhaps also a trace of oxide of chromium to a very  high temperature for a considerable time, and then cooling very slowly,  to obtain a ruby which is nearly the same in its structure as the real  gem; its specific gravity and hardness may perhaps be to standard, and  when properly cut, its brilliance would deceive all but an expert. And  as in some real rubies there are found slight hollows corresponding or  analogous to the bubbles found in melted glass, it becomes a matter of  great difficulty to distinguish the real from the imitation by such  tests as hardness, specific gravity, dichroism, and the like, so that in  such a case, short of risking the ruin of the stone, ordinary persons  are unable to apply any convincing tests. Therefore, only the expert can  decide, by his appreciation of the delicate shade of difference in the  light of a true ruby and that of an excellent imitation, and by the  distribution of the colour, which--however experienced the chemist may  be, or with what care the colouring matter may have been incorporated in  the mass--has been found impossible of distribution throughout the body  of an artificial stone so perfectly and in the same manner and direction  as nature herself distributes it in the genuine. This alone, even in the  closest imitations, is clear to the eye of the expert, though not to the  untrained eye, unless the stone is palpably spurious. To one who is  accustomed to the examination of precious stones, however perfect the  imitation, it is but necessary to place it beside or amongst one or more  real ones for the false to be almost instantly identified, and that with  certainty.      _The Sapphire._    The Sapphire is not so easy to imitate, as its hardness exceeds that of  the ruby, and imitations containing its known constituents, or of glass,  are invariably softer than the natural stone. As before remarked, almost  any form of corundum other than red is, broadly, called sapphire, but  giving them their strictly correct designations, we have the olivine  corundum, called \"chrysolite\" (oriental), which is harder than the  ordinary or \"noble\" chrysolite, sometimes called the \"peridot.\" The  various yellow varieties of corundum take the name of the \"oriental  topaz,\" which, like most, if not all, the corundum varieties, is harder  than the gem which bears the same name, minus the prefix \"oriental.\"  Then we have the \"amethyst\" sapphire, which varies from a red to a blue  purple, being richer in colour than the ordinary amethyst, which is a  form of violet-coloured quartz, but the corundum variety, which, like  its companions, is called the \"oriental\" amethyst, is both rarer and  more precious. A very rare and extremely beautiful green variety is  called the oriental emerald. The oriental jacinth, or hyacinth, is a  brown-red corundum, which is more stable than the ordinary hyacinth,  this latter being a form of zircon; it changes colour on exposure to  light, which colour is not restored by subsequent retention in darkness.    The blue sapphire is of all shades of blue, from cornflower blue to the  very palest tints of this colour, all the gradations from light to dark  purple blues, and, in fact, so many shades of tone and colour that they  become almost as numerous as the stones. These stones are usually found  in similar situations to those which produce the ruby, and often along  with them. The lighter colours are usually called females, or feminine  stones, whilst the darker ones are called masculine stones. Some of  these dark ones are so deep as to be almost black, when they are called  \"ink\" sapphires, and if inclining to blue, \"indigo\" sapphires, in  contradistinction to which the palest of the stones are called \"water\"  sapphires. The colouring matter is not always even, but is often spread  over the substance of the stone in scabs or \"splotches,\" which rather  favours imitation, and, where this unevenness occurs, it may be  necessary to cut or divide the stone, or so to arrange the form of it  that the finished stone shall be equally blue throughout.    In some cases, however, the sapphire may owe its beauty to the presence  of two, three or more colours in separate strata appearing in one stone;  such as a portion being a green-blue, another a cornflower blue, another  perfectly colourless, another a pale sky blue, another yellow, each  perfectly distinct, the stone being cut so as to show each colour in its  full perfection.    This stone, the sapphire, is hardness No. 9 (see \"Hardness\" table), and  therefore ranks next to the diamond, which makes it a matter of great  difficulty to obtain an imitation which is of the same specific gravity  and of the same degree of hardness, though this has been done. Such  stones are purchasable, but though sold as imitations at comparatively  low price, and the buyer may consider them just as good as the real gem,  to the experienced eye they are readily detectable.    By heating a sapphire its blue colour slowly fades, to complete  transparency in many cases, or at any rate to so pale a tint as to pass  for a transparent stone. Valuable as is the sapphire, the diamond is  more so, and it follows that if one of these clear or \"cleared\"  sapphires is cut in the \"rose\" or \"brilliant\" form--which forms are  reserved almost exclusively for the diamond--such a stone would pass  very well as a diamond, and many so cut are sold by unscrupulous people  as the more valuable stone, which fraud an expert would, of course,  detect.    Sapphires are mentioned by Pliny, and figure largely in the ancient  history of China, Egypt, Rome, etc. The Greeks dedicated the sapphire  specially to Jupiter, and many of the stones were cut to represent the  god; it also figured as one of the chief stones worn by the Jewish High  Priest on the breast-plate. Some stones have curious rays of variegated  colour, due to their crystalline formation, taking the shape of a star;  these are called \"asteriated,\" or \"cat's eye\" sapphires. Others have  curious flashes of light, technically called a \"play\" of light (as  described in Chapter VI. on \"Colour\"), together with a curious blue  opalescence; these are the \"girasol.\" Another interesting variety of  this blue sapphire is one known as \"chatoyant\"; this has a rapidly  changing lustre, which seems to undulate between a green-yellow and a  luminous blue, with a phosphorescent glow, or fire, something like that  seen in the eyes of a cat in the dark, or the steady, burning glow  observed when the cat is fascinating a bird--hence its name. This is not  the same variety as the \"asteriated,\" or \"cat's eye\" or \"lynx eye\"  mentioned above.          CHAPTER XIV.    VARIOUS PRECIOUS STONES--_continued._      _The Chrysoberyl._    There are certain stones and other minerals which, owing to their  possession of numerous microscopically fine cavities, of a globular or  tubular shape, have the appearance of \"rays\" or \"stars,\" and these are  called \"asteriated.\" Several of such stones have been discussed already  in the last chapter, and in addition to these star-like rays, some of  the stones have, running through their substance, one or more streaks,  perhaps of asbestos or calcite, some being perfectly clear, whilst  others are opalescent. When these streaks pass across the star-like  radiations they give the stone the appearance of an eye, the rays  forming the iris, the clear, opalescent, or black streak closely  resembling the slit in a cat's eye, and when these stones are cut _en  cabochon_, that is, dome-shaped (see Chapter XI. on \"Cutting\"), there is  nothing to deflect the light beams back and forth from facet to facet,  as in a diamond, so that the light, acting directly on these radiations  or masses of globular cavities and on the streak, causes the former to  glow like living fire, and the streak appears to vibrate, palpitate,  expand, and contract, exactly like the slit in the eye of a cat.    There are a considerable number of superstitions in connection with  these cat's-eye stones, many people regarding them as mascots, or with  disfavour, according to their colour. When possessing the favourite hue  or \"fire\" of the wearer, such as the fire of the opal for those born in  October, of the ruby for those born in July, etc., these stones are  considered to bring nothing but good luck; to ward off accident, danger,  and sudden death; to be a charm against being bitten by animals, and to  be a protection from poison, the \"evil eye,\" etc. They figured largely,  along with other valuable jewels, in the worship of the ancient  Egyptians, and have been found in some of the tombs in Egypt. They also  appeared on the \"systrum,\" which was a sacred instrument used by the  ancient Egyptians in the performance of their religious rites,  particularly in their sacrifices to the goddess Isis. This, therefore,  may be considered one of their sacred stones, whilst there is some  analogy between the cat's-eye stones and the sacred cat of the Egyptians  which recurs so often in their hieroglyphics; it is well known that our  domestic cat is not descended from the wild cat, but from the celebrated  cat of Egypt, where history records its being \"domesticated\" at least  thirteen centuries B.C. From there it was taken throughout Europe, where  it appeared at least a century B.C., and was kept as a pet in the homes  of the wealthy, though certain writers, speaking of the \"mouse-hunters\"  of the old Romans and Greeks, state that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23644"],[0,"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman (#14)"],[1,"the corner and out of here  at the very first chance. Girls are an awful nuisance anyway.\"    \"Nothing like true chivalry,\" murmured the freckle-faced freshman. An  instant later he was sprinting down the gymnasium as fast as his short  legs could carry him, the Crane in hot pursuit.    \"Cut it out, fellows,\" laughed Harold Macy. \"You'll upset something or  other, and then, look out.\"    \"If we do it will be the Crane's fault,\" came plaintively from the  freckle-faced freshman, as he dodged his pursuer with an agility born of  long practice. \"I don't see why he wants to chase me. I merely made a  simple remark.\"    \"Now that you've owned up to its being simple I'll let you off this  time,\" declared the Crane, magnanimously, \"but see that it doesn't  happen again.\"    \"I will,\" was the glib promise. \"I'm sorry I said you were a  grasshopper. You look more like a giraffe.\"    Then he made a hurried exit through a nearby side door, leaving the  Crane to vow dire vengeance the next time he ventured within reach.    A little further loitering and the group of boys broke up, and, leaving  the gymnasium, went home to get ready for the evening's fun and be back  in good season to help receive their guests.    There were two guests, however, who dressed for the party with entirely  different emotions. To Constance it was the most wonderful night of her  life. She stole frequent, half-startled glances at her blue satin-shod  feet and even pinched a fold of her chiffon gown between her fingers to  feel if it were real. Mrs. Dean had arranged the girl's fair curling  hair in precisely the same fashion that Mary Raymond wore hers, and when  she had been hooked into the precious gown, with its exquisite little  sprays of rosebuds, she thought she knew just how poor, lowly Cinderella  felt when the fairy godmother touched her with her wand. While she was  being dressed she said little, yet Marjorie and her mother knew by the  happy light that crowded the wistful look quite out of her expressive  eyes that their guest was too deeply appreciative for words.    Marjorie, who looked radiantly pretty in her frock of pink silk with its  overdress of delicate pink net, welcomed the dance with all the  enthusiasm of one who was heartily glad to get in touch with the social  side of her school life. She had forgotten for the moment that certain  girls in the freshman class had turned against her; that she was no  longer a member of the freshman basketball team. She remembered only  that it seemed ages since she had attended a party and she hoped  fervently that someone would ask her to dance.    Jerry and Irma had arranged to call for Marjorie and Constance, as the  quartette were to use the Macys' limousine. When the automobile stopped  before the house, Jerry insisted on getting out and running into the  house to see her friends' gowns. Irma followed her, a smile of  good-natured tolerance on her placid face.    \"Jerry couldn't wait to see your dresses,\" she said, then exclaimed in  wonder: \"How lovely you look, Constance, and what a perfectly sweet  gown!\"    Constance colored to the tips of her small ears. Jerry, too, began  voicing loud approval, and when, after having stood in line and been  inspected by Mrs. Dean, the four girls piled into the limousine,  Constance was overcome with the peculiar sensation of experiencing too  much happiness. She felt that it could not possibly last.    The gymnasium was fairly well filled when they entered and by half past  eight o'clock the majority of the guests had arrived. Hardly had they  deposited their scarfs in the dressing-room and administered last  judicious pats to straying fluffy locks of hair when Jerry, who had  disappeared the moment they reached the dressing-room, came hurrying  back with the information that Hal was waiting outside to do the honors.  \"You'd better hurry out and console the Crane, Irma,\" she added slyly.  \"He looks about ten feet tall in his evening clothes and perfectly  miserable.\"    Following in Jerry's wake Marjorie stepped into the gaily decorated room  and the next instant was shaking hands with handsome Hal Macy, the most  popular fellow in Weston High. As the brown eyes met the frank manly  gaze of the gray, there passed between the two young people a vivid  flash of liking and comradeship that was later to develop into a stanch  and beautiful friendship.    \"I am so glad to know you,\" said Marjorie, earnestly. \"I am very fond of  your sister.\"    \"I am sure we shall be friends,\" declared Hal Macy. Involuntarily he put  out his hand. Marjorie's hand met it, and thus began the friendship  between Marjorie Dean and Hal Macy.          CHAPTER XII    ON THE FIRING LINE      Introductions followed thick and fast. More than one pair of boyish eyes  had been centered approvingly on the girls that \"Macy\" was \"rushing,\"  and he was soon besieged with gentle reminders not to be stingy, but to  give someone else a chance.    When the enlivening strains of a popular dance began, Hal Macy pointed  significantly to his name on Marjorie's card. She nodded happily then  glanced quickly about to see if Constance had a partner. Surely enough,  she was just about to dance off with a rather tall, slender lad, whose  dark, sensitive face, heavy-browed, black-lashed eyes of intense blue  and straight-lipped, sensitive mouth caused her to say impulsively, \"Oh,  who is that nice-looking boy dancing with Constance?\"    Hal glanced after the two graceful, gliding figures. \"That's Lawrence  Armitage. He's one of the best fellows in school and my chum. You ought  to hear him play on the violin. He's going to Europe to study when he  finishes high school.\"    \"How interesting,\" commented Marjorie as they joined the dancers. Then,  as Mignon La Salle, wearing an elaborate apricot satin frock, flashed by  them on the arm of a rather stout boy, with a disagreeable face,  Marjorie suddenly remembered the existence of Mignon, Muriel and Susan.  Her eyes began an eager search for the Picture Girl. Muriel was sure to  look pretty in evening dress. Mignon's frock made her look older, she  decided. She soon spied Muriel, whose gown of white lace was vastly  becoming. So was Susan Atwell's dress of old rose and silver. She  wondered a trifle wickedly if they had not been surprised to see  Constance blossom out in such brave attire. Then she put the thought  aside as unworthy and determined to remember only the good time she was  having.    After each dance the four friends managed to meet and compare notes  before they were off again with their next partners, and as the party  progressed it became noticeable that there were no wallflowers in that  particular group.    \"What do you think of that Stevens girl to-night, Mignon?\" inquired  Susan Atwell as she and the French girl stood together for a moment  between dances.    Mignon's elfish eyes gleamed angrily. \"I think such beggars as she ought  never to be allowed to come to our parties. Goodness knows where she  borrowed that dress. Perhaps she didn't borrow it.\" She raised her  shoulders significantly. \"If Laurie Armitage knew what a low,  disreputable family she has, I don't think he'd waste his time with  her.\"    \"Did Laurie ask you to dance to-night?\" asked Susan inquisitively.    But with a muttered, \"I want to speak to Marcia,\" Mignon flounced off  without answering Susan's question, and the latter confided to Muriel  afterward that Mignon was mad as anything because Laurie hadn't noticed  her, but was trailing about after Miss Nobody Stevens.    Completely unaware that she was adding to the French girl's list of  grievances, Constance had danced to her heart's content, quite positive  in her own mind that she had never met a more delightful boy than  Lawrence Armitage, and that never before had she so greatly enjoyed  herself. And now the wonderful party was almost over. She examined her  card to see with whom she had the next dance. Then her glance straying  down, she noticed that a bit of the tiny plaiting at the bottom of her  chiffon skirt had become loose and was hanging. Fearful of a fall, she  hurried toward the dressing-room. She would have the maid take a stitch  or two in it.    But the maid was not in the room.    A solitary figure in an apricot gown stood before the mirror, lingered  for a moment after Constance entered, then glided noiselessly out.  Evincing no sign of having seen Mignon, Constance began a diligent  hunt for a needle and thread. Failing to find them, she fastened the  loose bit of plaiting with a pin and hurried out into the gymnasium. Her  next dance was with Lawrence Armitage. She must not miss it.    To her surprise Mignon re-entered the dressing-room as she left it.  Constance quickly made her way toward the corner which her friends had  selected as their headquarters.    \"I tore the plaiting of my dress,\" she said ruefully to Marjorie. \"I  couldn't find the maid or a needle, so I had to pin it. I'm awfully  sorry. I don't know how it happened.\"    \"That's nothing,\" returned Marjorie, cheerfully. \"I have a great long  tear in my sleeve. Someone caught hold of it in Paul Jones, and away it  went. Don't look so guilty over a little thing like that.\"    \"You don't----\" began Constance, but she never finished.    A tense little figure clad in apricot satin confronted her, crying out  in tones too plainly audible to those standing near, \"Where is my  bracelet? What have you done with it?\"    Constance stared at her accuser in stupefied amazement. Her friends,  too, were for the moment speechless.    \"Answer me!\" commanded Mignon. \"I left it on the table in the  dressing-room. You were the only one in there at the time. When I  remembered and came back for it you were just leaving, but the bracelet  was gone. No one else except you could have taken it.\"    Still Constance continued to stare in horror at the French girl. She  tried to speak, but the words would not come. Attracted by Mignon's"]]]
