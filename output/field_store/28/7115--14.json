I resumed, trembling with rage: \"You never gave any lessons. I have been  everywhere. Nobody knows you. Whence came that money, those laces, those  jewels?\" She threw me a glance full of despairing sadness, and that was  all. In truth, I ought to have spared her, and allowed her to die in  peace. But I had loved her too well. My jealousy was stronger than my  pity. I continued: \"For five years you have deceived me, lying to me  every day, every hour. You knew my whole life, and I knew nothing of  yours. Nothing, not even your name. For it is not yours, is it, the name  you bear? Ah liar! liar! What, she is going to die, and I do not even  know by what name to call her! Come, tell me who you are? Whence come  you? Why did you intrude into my life? Speak! Tell me something!\"    Vain efforts! Instead of answering, she with difficulty turned her face  to the wall, as though she feared that her last glance might betray her  secret. And thus the unhappy creature died! Died without a word, liar to  the last.    [Illustration: p191-202]    [Illustration: p195-206]          THE COMTESSE IRMA.    \"_M. Charles d'Athis, literary man, has the honour to inform you of the  birth of his son Robert._    \"_The child is doing well._\"    Some dozen years ago, all literary and artistic Paris received this  little note on the glossiest of paper, embossed with the arms of the  Counts of d'Athis-Mons, of whom the last Charles d'Athis had--while  still young--succeeded in making for himself a genuine reputation as a  poet.    \"The child is doing well.\" And the mother? Of her there was no mention  in the note. Every one knew her but too well. She was the daughter of an  old poacher of Seine et Oise; a quondam model, named Irma Salle, whose  portrait had figured in every exhibition, as the original had in every  studio. Her low forehead, lip curled like an antique, this chance return  of the peasant's face to primitive lines--a turkey herd with Greek  features--the slightly tanned skin common to all whose childhood  is spent in the open air, giving to fair hair reflections of pale  silkiness, adorned this minx with a kind of wild originality, completed  by a pair of magnificently green eyes, burning beneath heavy eyebrows.    [Illustration: p196-207]    One night, on leaving a _bal de l'Opera_, d'Athis had taken her to sup  with him, and though this was two years ago, the supper still continued.  But, whereas Irma had become completely a part of the poet's life,  this intimation of the child's birth, curt and haughty as it was,  sufficiently indicated how little she was considered by him. And in  truth, in this temporary household, the woman was scarcely more than a  housekeeper, showing in the management of the gentleman-poet's house  the hard shrewdness of her dual nature of peasant and courtesan; and  endeavouring, at no matter what price, to render herself indispensable.    [Illustration: p197-208]    Too rustic, and too stupid to understand anything of d'Athis' genius, of  those fine verses, fashionable and refined, which made of him a sort of  Parisian Tennyson, she nevertheless understood how to bend to all his  whims, and be silent under his contempt; as if in the depths of that  peasant nature lurked something of the boor's humble admiration for his  lord. The birth of the child only served to accentuate her unimportance  in the house.    When the dowager Comtesse d'Athis-Mons, the mother of the poet, a  distinguished and very great lady, learned that a grandson was born to  her, a sweet little Vicomte, duly recognized and authenticated by the  author of his being,* she was seized with a wish to see and kiss the  child. It was, to be sure, a rather bitter reflection for the former  reader to Queen Marie-Amelie to think that the heir of such a great name  should have such a mother; but, keeping strictly to the terms of  the _billets de faire pari_ the venerable lady could forget that the  creature existed.    * According to French law, an unmarried man recognizing his illegitimate  child, thereby confers on him all the rights of a legitimate one,  including both title and fortune.    When she went to see the child out at nurse, she chose the days on which  she would be sure not to meet any one; she admired him, spoilt him, took  him to her heart, worshipped him with that grandmotherly adoration which  is the last love of a woman's life, giving her an excuse for living  a few years longer in order to see the little ones springing up and  growing around her. Then when the baby Vicomte was a little bigger and  returned to live with his father and mother, a treaty was made, for  the Comtesse could not give up her beloved visits; at the sound of the  grandmother's ring, Irma humbly and silently disappeared, or else the  child was taken to his grandmother's house, and thus spoilt by his  two mothers. He loved them equally, somewhat astonished to feel in  the warmth of their caresses, a kind of exclusive-ness, a wish to  monopolize. D'Athis, careless of everything but his verses, absorbed by  his growing fame, was content to adore his little Robert, to talk of him  to everyone and to imagine that the child belonged to him, and him only.  This illusion did not last.    \"I should like to see you married,\" his mother said to him one day.    \"Yes, but how about the child?\" \"Don't worry yourself about that. I have  picked out for you a young girl of good family but poor, who adores you.  I have introduced Robert to her, and they are already great friends.  Besides, the first year I will keep the darling with me. Afterwards, we  shall see.\"    [Illustration: p200-211]    \"And--the mother?\" hesitated the poet, reddening a little, for it was  the first time that he had spoken of Irma to his mother.    [Illustration: p201-212]    \"Pooh!\" replied the old dowager, laughing, \"we will settle something  handsome on her, and I am quite sure she will soon be married also. The  _bourgeois_ of Paris is not particular.\"    That very evening, d'Athis, who had never been desperately in love  with his mistress, spoke to her of these arrangements and found her as  usual--submissive and apparently docile to his will. But the next  day, when he returned home, he found that mother and child had flown.  Finally, they were discovered in a wretched hut on the borders of the  Forest of Rambouillet, with Irma's father; and when the poet arrived he  found his son, his young prince, in his velvet and lace, jumping on  the old poacher's knee, playing with his pipe, running after the hens,  delighted to shake his fair curls in the fresh air. D'Athis, though much  upset by emotion, pretended to laugh the affair off, and wished at once  to take his fugitives home with him. But Irma did not see the matter  in the same light. She had been dismissed; she took her child with her.  What more natural? Nothing short of the poet's promise that he would  give up all thoughts of marriage decided her to return. Moreover, she  made her own conditions. It had been too long forgotten that she was  Robert's mother. Always to disappear and hide whenever Madame d'Athis  appeared, was no longer possible for her. The child was growing too old  for her to be exposed to such humiliations before him. It was therefore  agreed that as Madame d'Athis had refused to be brought into contact  with her son's mistress, she should no longer go to his house, but that  the child should be brought to her every day.    Then began for the old grandmother a regular torture. Every day fresh  pretexts were made to keep the child away; he had coughed, it was too  cold, it was raining. Then came his walks, rides, gymnastic exercises.  The poor old lady never saw her grandson. At first she tried complaining  to d'Athis; but women alone have the secret of carrying on these little  warfares. Their ruses remain invisible, like the hidden stitches which  catch back the folds and laces of their dress. The poet could see  nothing of it; and the saddened grandmother spent her life in waiting  for her darling's visit, in watching for him in the street, when he  walked out with a servant; and these furtive kisses and hasty glances  only augmented her maternal passion without satisfying it.    During this time, Irma Salle--always by means of the child--succeeded in  gaining ground in the father's heart. She was the recognized head of the  house now, received visitors, gave parties, settled herself as a woman  who means to remain where she is. Still she took care to say from time  to time to the little Vicomte, before his father: \"Do you remember the  chickens at Grandpapa Salle's? Shall we go back and see them?\"    [Illustration: p204-215]    And by this everlasting threat of departure, she paved the way to the  end she had in view--marriage.    It took her five years to become a Comtesse, but at length she gained  her point. One day, the poet came in fear and trembling to announce to  his mother that he had decided to marry his mistress, and the old lady,  instead of being indignant hailed the calamity as a deliverance, seeing  but one thing in the marriage; the possibility of once more entering her  son's door, and of freely indulging her affection for her little Robert.    [Illustration: p205-216]    In truth, the real honeymoon was for the grandmother. D'Athis, after  this rash act, wished to be away from Paris for a time. He felt uneasy  there. And as the child, clinging to his mother's skirts ruled the  house, they all established themselves in Irma's native country, within  hail of old father Salle's chickens. It was indeed the most curious, the  most ill-assorted household that could be imagined. Grandmama d'Athis  and Grandpapa Salle met each night at the evening toilet of their  grandson. The old poacher, his short black pipe wedged into the corner  of his mouth; and the former"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#14)"],[1,"consented  to the use of American troops in the expedition.    Even this concession of President Wilson was limited to the one regiment  of infantry with the needed accompaniments of engineer and medical  troops. The bitter irony of this limitation is apparent in the fact that  while it allowed the Supreme War Council to carry out its scheme of an  Allied Expedition with the publicly announced purposes before outlined,  committing America and the other Allies to the guarding of supplies at  Murmansk and Archangel and frustrating the plans of Germany in North  Russia, it did not permit the Allied War Council sufficient forces to  carry out its ultimate and of course secret purpose of reorganizing the  Eastern Front, which naturally was not to be advertised in advance  either to Russians or to anyone. The vital aim was thus thwarted and the  expedition destined to weakness and to future political and diplomatic  troubles both in North Russia and in Europe and America.    During the months spent in winning the participation of the United  States in an Allied Expedition to North Russia, England took some  preliminary steps which safeguarded the Murmansk Railway as far south  toward Petrograd as Kandalaksha.    Royal Engineers and Marines, together with a few officers and men from  French and American Military Missions, who had worked north with the  diplomatic corps, were thus for a dangerously long period the sole  bulwark of the Allies against complete pro-German domination of the  north of Russia. Some interesting stories could be told of the clever  secret work of the American officers in ferreting out the evidences in  black and white, of the co-operation of the German War Office with  Lenine and Trotsky. And stories of daring and pluck that saved men's  lives and kept the North Russians from a despairing surrender to the  Bolsheviki.    Meanwhile England was taking measures herself to support these men so as  to form a nucleus for the larger expedition when it should be  inaugurated by the Allied Supreme War Council. But the total number of  British officers and men who could be spared for the purpose, in view of  the critical situation on the Western Front, was less than 1,200. And  these had to be divided between the widely separated areas of Murmansk  and Archangel. And the officers and men sent were nearly all, to a man,  those who had already suffered wounds or physical exhaustion on the  Western Front. This was late in June. About this time the plan of the  Allied Supreme War Council as already stated was, under strict  limitations, acceded to by President Wilson, and the doughboys of the  339th Infantry in July found themselves in England hearing about  Archangel and disgustedly exchanging their Enfields for the Russian  rifles.    For various reasons the command of the expedition was assigned by  General Foch to General Poole, the British officer who had been so  enthusiastic about rolling up a big volunteer army of North Russians to  go south to Petrograd and wipe out the Red dictatorate and re-establish  the old hard-fighting Russian Front on the East. Naturally, American  soldiers who fought that desperate campaign in North Russia now feel  free to criticize the judgment of General Foch in putting General Poole  in command. It appears from the experiences of the soldiers up there  that for military, for diplomatic and for political reasons it would  have been better to put an American general in command of the  expedition. And while we are at it we might as well have our little say  about President Wilson. We think he erred badly in judgment. He either  should have sent a large force of Americans into North Russia--as we did  into Cuba--a force capable of doing up the job quickly and thoroughly,  or sent none at all. He should have known that the American doughboy  fights well for a cause, but that a British general would have a hard  time convincing the Americans of the justice of a mixed cause. This is  confession of a somewhat blind prejudice which the American citizen has  against the aggressive action of British arms wherever on the globe they  may be seen in action, no matter how justifiable the ultimate turn of  events may prove the British military action to have been. We say that  this prejudice should have been taken into account when the American  doughboy was sent to Russia to fight under British command. It might not  be out of order to point out that the North Russian shared with his  American allies in that campaign the same prejudice, unreasonable at  times without doubt, but none the less painful prejudice against the  British command of the expedition. And all this in spite of the fact  that most of the British officers were personally above reproach, and  General Ironside, who soon succeeded the failing Poole, was every inch  of his six foot-four a man and a soldier, par excellence.    The French were able to send only part of a regiment, one battalion of  Colonial troops and a machine gun company, who reached the Murmansk late  in July about the time the Americans were sailing from England. They  were soon sent on to Archangel, where political things were now come to  a head.    The Serbian battalion which had left Odessa at the time of the summer  collapse of the Russian armies in 1917 had gradually worked its way  northward from Petrograd on the Petrograd-Kola Railroad with the  intention of shipping for the Western fighting front by way of England.  They had been of potential aid to the Allied military missions during  the summer and now were permitted by the Serbian government to be joined  to the Allied expedition. They were accordingly put into position along  the Kola Railroad. These troops, of course, as well as thousands of  British troops which were stationed in the Murmansk and by the British  War Office were numbered in the North Russian Expeditionary forces, were  of no account whatever in the military activities of that long fall and  winter and spring campaign in the far away Archangel area where the  American doughboys for months, supported here and there by a few British  and French and Russians, stood at bay before the swarming Bolos and  battled for their lives in snow and ice.    The battalion of Italian troops with its company of skii troops which  sailed from England with the American convoy also went to the Murmansk  and all the American doughboy saw of Italians in the fighting area of  Archangel, North Russia, was the little handful of well dressed Italian  officers and batmen in the city of Archangel. Of course, we had plenty  of representation of Italian fighting blood right in our own ranks. They  were in the O. D. uniform and were American citizens. And of course the  same thing could be said of many another nationality that was  represented in the ranks of American doughboys and whose bravery in  battle and fortitude in hardships of cold and hunger gave evidence that  no one nationality has a corner on courage and \"guts\" and manhood. To  call the roll of one of those heroic fighting companies of doughboys or  engineers or medical or hospital companies in the olive drab would  evidence by the names of the men and officers that the best bloods of  Europe and of Asia were all pulsing in the American ranks.    The presence of British, French and American war vessels and the first  small bodies of troops encouraged the Murmansk Russian authorities to  declare their independence of the Red Moscow crowd and to throw in their  lot with the Allies in the work of combatting the agents of the German  War Office in the North. In return the Allies were to furnish money,  food and supplies. Early in July written agreement to this effect had  been signed by the Murmansk Russian authorities and all the Allies  represented, including the United States. It will be recalled that  Ambassador Francis had been obliged to leave Petrograd by the Bolshevik  rulers, and he had gone north into Murmansk.    The result of this agreement with the Murmansk and the arrival of  further troops at the Murmansk coast, together with the promise of more  to follow immediately, was to influence the Russian local government of  the state of Archangel to break with the hated Reds. And so, on August  1st, a quiet coup d'etat was effected. The anti-Bolshevists came out  into the open. The Provisional North Russian Government was organized.  The people were promised an election and they accepted the situation  agreeably for they had detested the Red government. Two cargoes of food  had no little also to do with the heartiness of their acceptance of the  Allied military forces and the overturn of the Bolshevik government.    Within forty-eight hours came the military forces already mentioned, the  advance forces of the British that preceded the Allied expedition,  consisting of a huge British staff, a few British soldiers, a few French  and a detachment of fifty American sailors from the \"Olympia.\" In a few  days the battalion of French colonials sailed in from Murmansk.    The coming of the troops prevented the counter coup of the Reds. They  could only make feeble resistance. The passage up the delta of the Dvina  River and the actual landing while exciting to the jackies met with  little opposition. Truth to tell, the wily Bolsheviks had for many weeks  seen the trend of affairs, and, expecting a very much larger expedition,  had sent or prepared for hasty sending south by rail toward Vologda or  by river to Kotlas of all the military supplies and munitions and  movable equipment as well as large stores of loot and plunder from the  city of Archangel and suburbs. Count von Mirbach, the German ambassador  at Moscow, threatened Lenine and Trotsky that the German army then  glowering in Finland, across the way, would march on Petrograd unless  the military stores were brought out of Archangel.    The rearguard of the Bolshevik armed forces was disappearing over the  horizon when the"]]]
