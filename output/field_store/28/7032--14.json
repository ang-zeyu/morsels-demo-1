Undoubtedly, the feeling among the English must be in  favour of Bajee Rao and Nana. As Bajee is the son of Rugoba, he is  their natural ally. Moreover, they would object most strongly to  see Scindia become master of the whole Mahratta power; which he  would probably use against them, at the first opportunity. It  would, as you say, greatly facilitate my obtaining a fair position  among the English; and I might also be able to do Nana a service.  Of course, I have seen the English Resident many times, in the  streets of Poona; and more than once, on special occasions, at  Mahdoo Rao's court. As it is his business to know something of all  connected with the palace, it is probable that he may have heard of  me; at any rate, it would be easier to explain to him my position,  than it would be to go down as a stranger to Bombay--where I should  be ignorant as to whom I should first approach, and how to declare  myself--a matter I have very often thought over.\"    The next morning the troop started at daybreak and, riding fast,  reached Poona by noon. Harry went at once to report what he had  seen to Nana.    \"I received your letter yesterday,\" the minister said, \"and the  news was indeed bad. Purseram Bhow has offered to go out to give  battle to Scindia, but my forces would have no chance: not only is  Scindia's army much larger, but he has the infantry regiments  commanded by foreign officers, and against these my infantry could  not prevail. It would be madness to risk fighting, under such  circumstances. The wheel may turn and, ere long, I may be in a  position to thwart the schemes of Scindia and Balloba.\"    Nana had never been conspicuous for personal courage, though his  moral courage, and his ability to meet any storm were unbounded. He  was now an old man, and dreaded the shock of battle, when the  chances appeared to be so much against him. He could not depend  upon the support of Bajee, who had already shown himself willing to  side with the strongest, and to make terms for himself, without the  slightest regard for those who had befriended him.    \"But if your excellency does not think of fighting, what course  will you pursue?\"    \"I shall leave the country, at once,\" he said. \"If I stop here, I  know that Balloba, who is my personal enemy, will have me put to  death. I only need time to recover from this sudden misfortune, and  it would be madness for me to wait here, and to fall into the power  of my enemies.    \"Purseram Bhow is greatly offended, because I will not allow him to  fight; but I, who have for so many years done my best to prevent  civil war in this country--a war which, however it ended, would  break up the Mahratta power--would not bring its horrors upon  Poona. It is against me that Balloba is marching and, if I retire,  bloodshed will be altogether averted.    \"Will you accompany me, Puntojee?\" he asked almost wistfully.    \"Assuredly I will do so, sir; and I think that I can answer for  Sufder, who has, I know, a great regard for your excellency. As to  myself, I have little hope that I should escape unharmed, if  Balloba arrive here before I leave. He detected me, even in my  disguise in his camp; and I had a narrow escape, for a party of his  cavalry pursued me, and would probably have caught me had not  Sufder, with his band, met me, and defeated them with a loss of  half their number. You may be sure that Balloba will learn who was  in command, and Sufder's life would be no safer than my own.    \"May I ask when your excellency is going to leave Poona?\"    \"Scouts were sent out yesterday, as soon as your letter was read  and, directly Scindia's army gets in motion, I shall receive news.  When I do, I shall leave. The horses will be saddled in readiness,  and I shall be at the edge of the Ghauts by the time Scindia  arrives here. You can tell Sufder to come, at once. He knows the  disposition of the captains of the various troops, and will be able  to tell me who can be depended upon.\"    Sufder was indeed outside the palace, having told Harry that he  would wait, until he had learned the result of his interview with  Nana. Harry briefly related to him his conversation with the  minister.    \"I think he is right,\" he said. \"Purseram Bhow is a stout fighter,  and is as brave as a lion; but Scindia's force would be double that  which he could gather, at such a short notice, and Nana does right  not to risk everything on the chance of a single fight. He is a  wily old fox, and has got safely through dangers which would have  crushed an ordinary man. You will see that, before long, he will be  back again, and reinstated in power.    \"At any rate, I will accompany him. After that thrashing we gave  Balloba's horsemen, my head would not be safe here an hour, after  his arrival.\"    On the road, Harry had informed him of the decision at which he had  arrived, upon Soyera's advice; and Sufder agreed that it would  certainly be a wise step. Accordingly, when the latter entered the  palace, Harry went straight to the British Residency. He sent in  his native name to Mr. Malet, and asked for an interview, and was  at once shown in.    \"You wish to speak to me, sir?\" the Resident said, in the Mahratta  language. \"I think I have seen you at Mahdoo Rao's court.\"    \"I have seen your excellency there,\" Harry replied, in the same  language.    Then, seeing that the Resident spoke the language with difficulty,  he went on, in English:    \"It is a matter chiefly personal to myself.\"    The Resident looked at him in surprise, for it was the first time  he had heard a Mahratta speaking English.    \"I am the son of Major Lindsay who, with his wife and escort, was  murdered by a party of Mahrattas, seventeen years ago, at the time  when the English army was advancing against Poona. I was saved by  the fidelity of an ayah, who had been in the family for ten years.  A cousin of hers was, fortunately, one of the leaders of the party  who attacked the camp and, with his connivance, she carried me off  and made her way back to her family, near Jooneer. She stained my  skin, as you see, and allowed it to be supposed that she had  married in Bombay, and that I was her own child.    \"She has brought me up with the intention of my rejoining my  countrymen, as soon as I became a man; for she did not see how,  until then, I could earn my living among strangers. She taught me  as much as she knew of the language and religion of the English  and, when I was twelve, took me down to Bombay and left me, for  some two years and a half, in the house of Mrs. Sankey, a lady who  taught some of the children of officers there. When I left Bombay I  was able to speak English as well as other English boys of my age.    \"My nurse had, from the earliest time I can remember, encouraged me  in taking part in all sports and games; and when I was but eight a  soldier, a cousin of hers, began to teach me my first exercise in  arms. I continued to work at this until I went down to Bombay and,  on my return, spent all my time, for some months, in riding and  shooting. After this I was, for a year, with a famous shikaree; and  took part in the killing of many tigers, and other wild beasts.  This was fortunate; for when, through this relation of my nurse, I  was introduced to Nana Furnuwees, and by him to Mahdoo Rao, the  latter was pleased to take a fancy for me, and appointed me to the  charge of the game preserves.    \"At the present moment I have just returned from a mission, in  disguise, to Scindia's camp. Nana has shown me great kindness. My  intention is to remain with him, until he has passed through his  present difficulties, which are very serious. After that, I hope to  be able to go to Bombay, and to obtain a commission in the  Company's service.\"    \"I remember well the circumstances of the murder of Major Lindsay,  and his wife; for I was in Bombay at the time. It was a matter of  deep regret to us all, for he was greatly liked but, at the time,  everyone was excited over the infamous treaty of Wurgaum. I  remember that when a party was sent out, on our receiving the news  of the attack, the bodies of the major and his wife were found, as  also those of his servants and sowars; but it was reported that no  trace could be discovered of the infant, or of his ayah. It was  thought possible that they had escaped, and hopes were entertained  that the woman might have carried off her charge. I have no doubt  as to the truth of your story.    \"Is your nurse still alive?\"    \"She is, sir, as is also the man who assisted her. His name is  Sufder, and he commands a troop of the Peishwa's cavalry. Both will  testify, at the right time, to the truth of my statement.\"    \"I can the more readily believe it,\" the Resident said, \"inasmuch  as, in spite of your colour, I can perceive a certain likeness to  Major Lindsay, whom I knew intimately.\"    \"My intention, in coming to see you now, sir, was to offer to  furnish any information to you, concerning the movements and plans  of Nana Furnuwees, so far as such information could do him no  harm.\"    \"I heard that there had been discussions between Nana and Purseram  Bhow, the latter wishing to give battle to Scindia; but I think  that Nana is right in refusing to sanction this for, from all I  hear, Scindia's army is very much the stronger.\"    \"It is, sir; and I should say that Purseram's army could hardly be  depended upon to fight, under such circumstances.\"    \"What is Nana going to do?\"    \"He is going to retire, as soon as Scindia's army is fairly in  motion.\"    \"He is in an awkward position,\" Mr. Malet said, \"but he has  reinstated himself, several times, when it seemed that everything  was lost. I have great respect for his abilities, and he is the  only man who can curb the ambition of Scindia and his ministers."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#14)"],[1,"adway.    \"Well, she's not perfect yet, of course, but I stick to it that she's  improved.\"    \"Oh, I dare say! But Ulyth's welcome to keep her cub. She'll always be  more or less of a trial. What else can you expect? 'What's bred in the  bone will come out!'\"    \"Yes, I'm a great believer in heredity,\" urged Beth, taking up the  cudgels for her chum. \"If you have ancestors it gives you a decided  pull.\"    \"Everybody has ancestors, you goose,\" corrected Gertrude.    \"Well, of course I mean aristocratic ones. The others don't count. It  must make a difference whether your grandfather was a gentleman or a  farm-boy. Rona says herself she's a democrat. I'm sure she looked the  part when she arrived.\"    \"I don't know that she exactly looks it now, though,\" said Gertrude,  championing Rona for once.    Everyone at the school realized that the Cuckoo was trying to behave  herself. The struggles towards perfection were sometimes almost  pathetic, though the girls mostly viewed them from the humorous side.  She would sit up suddenly, bolt upright, at the tea table, if Miss  Bowes' eye suggested that she was lolling; she apologized for accidents  at which she had laughed before, and she corrected herself if a  backwoods expression escaped her.    \"Am I really any shakes smarter--I mean, more toned up--than I was?\" she  asked Ulyth anxiously.    \"You're far better than you were last term. Do go on trying, that's  all!\"    \"Will they take me as a candidate in the Camp-fire League?\"    \"I expect so, but we shall have to ask Mrs. Arnold about that.\"    Since the great reunion by the stream in September there had been no  meetings of the Camp-fire League. Mrs. Arnold had been ill, and then  had gone away to recruit her health, and no one was able to take her  place as \"Guardian of the Fire\". She was recovered now, and at home  again, and had promised to help to make up for lost time by  superintending a gathering at the beginning of the new term. It was to  be held in the big hall of the school, though the girls begged hard to  have it out-of-doors, pleading that on a fine evening they could keep  perfectly warm, and it would only resemble a Fifth of November affair.    \"That may be all very well for you, but I'm not going to risk Mrs.  Arnold's catching cold,\" returned Miss Bowes; which argument put a final  stop to the idea.    \"We'll have ripping fun in the hall, if we can't be outside,\" beamed  Addie. \"I always enjoy a stunt.\"    \"What's a stunt?\" asked Rona.    \"A stunt? Why, it's just a stunt!\"    \"It's an American word,\" explained Lizzie. \"It means just having any fun  that comes. An impromptu kind of thing, you know. We sing, or recite, or  act, or dance, on the spur of the moment--anything to keep the ball  rolling, and anybody may be called upon at any moment to stand up and  perform.\"    \"Without knowing beforehand?\" queried Rona, looking horror-stricken.    \"Yes, that's the fun of it. We have a bag with all our names written on  slips of paper, and we draw them out one by one to fill up the  programme. Nobody knows who's to come next. You may be the very first,  or you may sit quaking all the evening, and never be called at all.\"    \"I hope to goodness--I mean, I hope very much--I shan't be drawn.\"    \"You never know; so you'd better have something in your mind's eye.\"    Punctually at six o'clock on the appointed night the whole school filed  into the hall, each girl carrying a candle in a candlestick. Saluting  their leader, they ranged themselves round the room for the opening  ceremony. At an indoor meeting this was of necessity different from the  kindling of the camp-fire, but it had a certain impressiveness of its  own. First the lamps were extinguished, and the room was placed in  entire darkness. Then Mrs. Arnold struck a match and lighted her candle,  which she held towards the Torch-bearer of highest rank, who lighted  hers from it, and performed the same service for her next neighbour. In  this way, one after another, the candles were lighted all round the  room, every girl saying, as she offered the flame to her comrade: \"I  pass on my light!\" After the \"shining\" song was sung, all the  candlesticks were arranged on the large central table, taking the place  the camp-fire would have occupied out-of-doors.    The business of the meeting came first, the roll-call was read, and the  recorders gave their reports of the last gathering. Several members were  awarded honours for knowing the stars, being able to observe certain  things in geology and field botany, or for ability in outdoor sports or  indoor occupations, such as carpentry, stencilling, or sewing. The  ambulance work and the knitting done last term were specially noted and  commended. A few new candidates applied for enrolment, and their  qualifications were carefully considered by the Guardian of the Fire.  Rona, after undergoing the League Catechism from Catherine Sullivan, the  head girl and chief Torch-bearer, had submitted her name as candidate,  and now waited with much anxiety to hear whether she would be accepted.  After several others had been admitted, Mrs. Arnold at last called:    \"Corona Margarita Mitchell.\"    Quite startled at the unaccustomed sound of her full Christian name,  Rona saluted and stepped forward.    \"You have passed only three out of the seven tests required,\" said Mrs.  Arnold. \"I'm afraid you will have to try again, Rona, and see if you can  be more successful before the next meeting. No candidate can be accepted  except on very good grounds. That is the law of the League.\"    Much crestfallen, the Cuckoo fell back into her place, and Mrs. Arnold  was just about to read the next name when Ulyth interrupted:    \"Please, Guardian, if a candidate has shown unusual presence of mind,  may that not stand in place of some of the other tests?\"    \"It depends on the circumstances. How does that apply in this case?\"    \"Rona has saved a life,\" declared Ulyth, then explained briefly how  Dorothy had fallen on to the hearth and had been caught back from the  fire in the very nick of time.    \"In her thin dress she would probably have been burnt to death but for  Rona's quickness,\" added Ulyth, with a tremble in her voice.    \"I had not heard of this,\" replied Mrs. Arnold. \"Rona is very greatly to  be congratulated on her presence of mind. Yes, I may safely say that it  can cancel the tests in which she has failed, and that we may enrol her  to-night as a candidate. Corona Margarita Mitchell, if for three months  you preserve a good character in the school, and learn to recite the  seven rules of the Camp-fire Law, you may then present yourself as  eligible for the initial rank of Wood-gatherer in the League. There is  your Candidate's Badge.\"    Immensely gratified, Rona received her little bow of blue ribbon. She  had hardly dared to hope for success, as Catherine had been rather  withering over her Catechism, and had warned her that she would probably  be disqualified. It was pleasant to meet with encouragement, and  especially to be commended before the whole school. She had never dreamt  of such luck, and she looked her grateful thanks at Ulyth across the  room.    She was the last but one on the list of applicants, and when Jessie  Howard (alas, poor Jessie!) had been rejected the ceremonial part of the  meeting was over. The girls smiled, for now the \"stunt\" was to begin.  Catherine produced the bag, shook it well, and handed it to Mrs. Arnold,  who drew out a slip of paper.    \"Marjorie Earnshaw!\" she announced.    \"Glad it's one of the Sixth to open the ball,\" murmured some of the  younger girls as Marjorie stepped to the circle reserved for performers  in front of the table.    The owner of the one guitar in the school was always much in request at  Camp-fire gatherings, so it seemed a fortunate chance that her name  should be drawn first. She had brought her instrument, so as to be  prepared in case the lot fell on her, and giving the E string a last  hurried tuning she sat down and began a popular American ditty. It was a  favourite among the girls, for it had a lively, rollicking chorus, which  they sang with great gusto. Fifty voices roaring out: \"Don't forget your  Dinah!\" seemed to break the ice and set the fun going.    Marjorie's E string snapped suddenly, but she played as best she could  on the others, though she confessed afterwards that she felt like a  horse that has lost its shoe. Except for this accident she would have  responded to the enthusiastic calls of \"Encore!\"; as it was, she retired  into the background to fix a new string. It lent a decided element of  excitement to the programme that nobody knew what the next item was to  be. The lot, as it happened, fell on one of the younger girls, who was  overwhelmed with shyness and could only with great urging be persuaded  to recite a short piece of poetry. By the law of the Stunt everybody was  obliged to perform if called upon, so Aveline fired off her sixteen  lines of Longfellow with breathless speed, and fled back joyfully to the  ranks of the Juniors. Two piano solos and a step-dance followed, then  the turn came to Doris Deane, a member of the Upper Fifth. Doris's  speciality was acting, so she promptly begged for two assistants, and  chose from IV B a couple of junior members who had practised with her  before. Taking Nellie and Trissie for \"Asia\" and \"Australia\", she gave  the scene from _Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch_ where that delightful  but haphazard heroine gets herself and the children ready to go to the  opera. The zeal with which she ironed their dresses, her alternate  scoldings and cajolings, her wild hunt for the tickets, which all the  while were stuck in her belt, the grandeur of her deportment when the  family was at last prepared for the outing, all were most amusingly  represented. Doris was really a born actress, and so completely carried  her audience with her that the lack of costumes and scenery was not felt  in"]]]
