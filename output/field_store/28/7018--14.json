M. and stopped at the Imperial Palace  Hotel. This is one of the finest watering places in France. A beautiful  lake surrounds the hotel, with mountains in the distance.    The next morning we called upon the Mayor and went through the usual  speeches. We were given a boat ride on the lake. Then we visited an old  castle. The coast looked very much like the coast of Maine between Bath  and Squirrel Island. We were taken by boat from Annecy to Menthon and  had luncheon at the Palace Hotel. Here Mr. Damour made his first speech,  which was received so enthusiastically that he was kissed by nearly all  the Frenchmen present.    We then visited an electric steel plant at Acierils, the French name  being the \"Electriques of Ugine\". We were greeted by, among other  things, a couple of American flags, but they were upside down.    We left Annecy at 5 P. M. for Lyons and stopped at the Terminus Hotel.  We saw a number of tattooed soldiers, that is tattooed with powder  marks, they having seen service.    On Sunday, October 1st, at 8 A. M. we left Lyons for Le Creusot, where  the great French steel plant is located. A serious discussion was held  on the train about going to the front and the dangers were depicted  quite vividly. We stopped at Chagny, after passing a very old church  dating back to the Tenth century. We saw, as we passed along, droves of  beautiful white cows, with not a speck of color.          X.    THE CREUSOT GUN WORKS      Arriving in Le Creusot we stopped at the Grand Hotel Moderne and had a  most enjoyable Sunday evening. It was discovered that our French  secretary, Emile Garden, had quite a tenor voice. He started in to sing  the Marseilles Hymn, and it was not long until all the Commission  joined, and then the hotel employes. Before we got through scores of  people came in from the street to see what was going on. The incident  was telegraphed by the newspaper correspondents to the Paris papers, and  it aided in the work of the commissioners by showing their patriotism  and sympathy for France.    We were told that there had been no strike at Le Creusot for twenty-five  years. The employes wear a special sleeve decoration which indicates  that they are in the same class as soldiers; that is to say, they are  making cannon and munitions and working for France.    We were given a breakfast at the Schneider club house and then visited  the plant. We were refused admission to the munitions plant. The works  employ about twenty thousand men and two thousand women. The output of  the plant is large projectiles, and for this reason the number of women  employed is relatively small. A number of five hundred and twenty  millimeter shells were shown to us; these shells are more than seven  feet long and weigh a ton and a half. We were also shown the guns from  which they are fired, but these were not quite completed. This plant  contains four blast furnaces of very small capacity, making special  grades of pig iron. The initial heat is not used, the steel being  reheated and repoured. A good deal of Vanadium alloy is used, and this  is made in America. At this plant we met Mr. Edmond Lemaitre, an  engineer who had been in Youngstown employed as an inspector. All the  employes, both men and women, wear wooden shoes. We noticed an absence  of safety devices and safety notices. Armored cars were being  manufactured for the government as well as armor plate, but this armor  plate mill was away behind the mills in our own country.    We had luncheon at the club house, but no speeches were made. None of  the proprietors or directors of the company was present. We then visited  the company hospital, a part of which was occupied by electric devices  for treating the wounded. Then we came to the home where the orphans of  the employes are taken care of.    [Illustration: New 520-mm. Gun, Carrying Projectile Seven Feet in Length  and Weighing 3,100 lbs., seen at Creusot Works.]    A great deal of attention is paid to the sanitary conditions and also to  the uniforms of the men, and a great deal that is done for the workmen  could be copied in our American plants. The history of these works,  the greatest of their kind in France, is interesting. Their former ore  supply, or at least a large part of it, was captured by the Germans near  Verdun.    The name Creusot was first mentioned in an old charter in 1253. In the  year 1502 coal was discovered there, and the year 1793 saw the opening  of the Canal du Centre. During the French Revolution the plant was taken  and exploited by the state and a little before the year 1800 was given  back to its owners. During the Napoleonic wars much work was done here.  In the year 1815, gun making was stopped and only coal mining was  allowed.    The dynasty of the Schneiders continued for four generations; the last  one, Charles Eugene Schneider, was born in 1868.    The first French locomotive was built at this plant and, in 1841, the  first hammer moved by steam power.    In the year 1855 the Crimean war led to much activity at this plant. In  1867 ten thousand workmen were employed. In the year 1870 the first  Bessemer steel produced in France, was made here, although the process  had then been in use in the United States for six years.    Since 1884 these works have been exporting guns to many foreign  countries.    In 1897 a large plant was built near Le Havre for the manufacture of  naval guns. In 1882 they built large naval works near Bordeaux, and  since 1906 they have been building the largest warships at that place.  In 1909, at Hyeres, near Toulon, studying and making of torpedoes was  begun, and this was followed in 1910 by submarines. Five plants are now  scattered through France for this kind of work.    The Creusot works do not employ children under fourteen years of age.  There are often three generations employed in this same kind of work,  and some families have up to twenty members working in one plant. They  have always been spared epidemics of any serious nature. With sanitary  and prosperous homes, few deaths have occurred in the first year of  life. The rate of deaths at Le Creusot is only ten per thousand while  the average in France is 16 per thousand, and in bad industrial centers  25 per thousand. Eighty per cent. of the children are nursed by the  mother. After the seventh month before birth mothers rest, and for a  period after and during this time they receive the usual wages.    The first school was opened here in 1787. At the age of fourteen  children can become apprentices and those of other towns or villages are  often attracted. After they have a school certificate, entrance to the  works is optional. From the age of twelve to sixteen years they must do  military preparation, with flags and musical band. The brightest  children go to high school to become engineers, and they are taught by  the best professors in France. They pay back the cost of their  education only when they have secured a good position. A thorough  medical examination is necessary.    Since the year 1875 savings banks for children have existed.    The first domestic science school was organized in Europe in the year  1865 at Goteborg. At first all the mothers were opposed to these  schools, but they soon favored them. One cannot enter these schools  without a diploma from the common schools. Each teacher is given  twenty-four pupils. The girls are taught to make their own apparel,  gardening, cooking, washing, ironing, mending and keeping home expense  accounts.    There are three classes of workmen. Ten selected, twenty auxiliaries,  thirty uneducated laborers. In January, 1912 there were twenty thousand  men employed. They all sign a full contract, after reading it, before  getting into the works. The contract can be cancelled by either party  with one week's notice. No proprietor of a saloon can work in the plant.  From 1837 to 1911 the salaries have increased 130 per cent. In the year  1911 the total of salaries was nearly thirty-three million francs. The  annual donations amount to three million francs. Delegates are nominated  by the workmen for conference with the employers to suggest better  conditions and improvements in working methods. Sixty-six per cent. of  their suggestions or demands have been adopted and the result is peace  and confidence. The company provides swimming pools, divided into two  parts, one-half for adults and the other half for younger men and boys.    The homes are subject to constant sanitary inspection and all unsanitary  buildings are destroyed. Safety appliances and all protecting apparatus  are painted in brilliant red. There has been a constant study of the  workman's house, since the eighteenth century. In 1840 the company had  one hundred workmen's houses; in 1912 two thousand five hundred, and in  addition to this hundreds of these houses have been bought by the  workmen by slow annual payments added to the rent. The types of houses  vary for one to four families. The rents are low and do not pay regular  interest on the investment. Ground space for gardens is furnished by the  company, with annual competitions and rewards for the best results.  Trees and seeds are furnished at nominal prices. There are two thousand,  two hundred and fifty gardens under cultivation.    The savings bank is managed by the company and safe investments are made  for the workmen, returns of from three to five per cent, on savings  being guaranteed.    In the year 1911, eight thousand workmen's accounts reached thirteen  million francs. The chief use of the savings is to buy homes. The total  amount advanced to workmen for building houses since 1845 was five  million francs, of which only eighty-three thousand, five hundred are  not yet paid back.    Co-operative societies for reducing the cost of living are organized to  enable the workmen to get supplies at cost.
