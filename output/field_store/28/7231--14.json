Mr. Moxon advertises as in  press, his _Poems_, with a Memoir of his life, by his brother, the Rev.  Derwent Coleridge; _Essays and Marginalia_, in two volumes; and _Lives  of Distinguished Northerns_, a new edition, in two volumes.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMARTINE receives for his _Histoire du Directoire_--the sequel of _The  Girondists_--at which he works from fourteen to sixteen hours every day,  only 12,000 francs, equal to about $2,400.           *       *       *       *       *    AMONG the \"books in press\" advertised in London at the beginning of the  year, by Bentley, are _The Correspondence of Horace Walpole, Earl of  Orford, and the Rev. William Mason_, now first published from the  original MSS., and edited, with notes, by the Rev. J. Mitford, author of  \"The Life of Gray.\" This work will contain the last series of Walpole's  unpublished letters. A _History of Greek and Roman Classical  Literature_, with an introduction on each of the languages, biographical  notices, and an account of the periods in which each principal author  lived and wrote, so far as literature was affected by such history, and  observations on the works themselves, by R. W. Browne, one of the  professors in King's College, London. And _The Literary Veteran_,  including sketches and anecdotes of the most distinguished literary  characters, from 1794 to 1849, by R. P. Gilles.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER has just published a volume entitled \"The  Island World of the Pacific,\" (Harpers,) which for various personal  interest, fulness and accuracy of information, and right feeling, is to  be preferred to any book on the subject since the appearance of Cook's  Voyages. We know of no traveller in Polynesia who has had better  opportunities for observation than Mr. Cheever. His abilities as a  writer were illustrated by \"The Whale and his Captors,\" published two or  three years ago. The style of the present performance is not at all  inferior, and it is especially commendable for a perspicuous  compactness. So much misrepresentation of the Sandwich and other Islands  has appeared lately, that we are glad of an opportunity to commend a  book so authoritative and satisfactory upon the whole subject.           *       *       *       *       *    M. J. MOREAU of Paris, has completed a new version into French of the  _Imitatio Christi_, and has accompanied it with select passages from the  Fathers and other pious authors. The same writer has also published  under the title of _Le Philosophe Inconnu_, an essay on the ideas and  writings of the celebrated theosophist Saint-Martin. This remarkable  mystic, who in his lifetime was surrounded by so many disciples and  admirers, is now known only to the curious seekers among the dusty  shelves of libraries. M. Moreau attempts to show that his heresies  contained a spice of orthodoxy, and this he endeavors to develop for the  benefit of whom it may concern.           *       *       *       *       *    BISHOP ONDERDONK of Pennsylvania is a person of large abilities; he is  one of the strongest writers of the Episcopal Church in the country; and  it is unjust that the unfortunate circumstances of his ecclesiastical  position should prevent the recognition of his merits as a scholar and  dialectician. We are pleased, therefore, that his friends have taken  measures for the publication of a collection of his _Theological Works_,  including sermons and Episcopal charges.           *       *       *       *       *    NEW GERMAN POEMS.--Louise von Ploennies has published two new books of  poetry, one under the title of _Neue Gedichte_ (New Poems), the other  _Oskar und Giaunetta_. They are spoken of as superior to her former  productions, and worthy of a most honorable place among the productions  of German poetesses. Oscar and Giaunetta is a love story in verse. The  purpose of the writer is to exhibit the masculine and feminine  principles, Thought and Beauty, as mutually completing each other in the  passion of love. The _Monates-Maehrchen_ (Tales of the Month), by Gustar  von Mayem, are poems of another sort. Instead of sentimentality, the  stock in trade of this writer is patriotism and politics. His inspiring  thought is the unity of Germany and the national greatness which must  result therefrom. Unfortunately this thought does not find so welcome a  reception with statesmen as with poets.           *       *       *       *       *    A PRODUCTION of the most indisputable German plodding and erudition is  the _Satzungen und Gebraeuche des talmudisch-rabbinischen Judenthums_, by  Dr. I. F. Schroeder, lately issued at Bremen. It gives a complete account  of the religious notions, doctrines, and usages of the Jews. To  theologians it is of high value for the light which it casts upon the  formation and institutions of the Christian Church. The author has  employed in its composition the writings of every sect, and has  condensed in it the result of a thorough study of the entire literature  relating to the Old Testament and the rabbinical writings. He writes  with the greatest impartiality, and in the interest of no particular  creed or tendency.           *       *       *       *       *    M. ARAGO said lately in the Academy of Sciences, upon the suggestion of  some possibilities in aerostation, that a long time since the whole  subject had been treated in a masterly manner by Mousnier, a celebrated  member of the Academy of Sciences. His treatise had remained in  manuscript in the public library of Metz, and if it should be committed  to the press, it would prove to those who think they have discovered new  methods of aerial locomotion, that what is plausible and rational in  their ideas was already perfectly well known, expounded and appreciated,  in the last century.           *       *       *       *       *    THE government of Naples constantly increases its list of prohibited  books. Among the works now excluded, Humboldt's Cosmos, Shakspeare,  Goldsmith, Heeren's Historical Treatises, Ovid, Lucian, Lucretius,  Sophocles, Suetonius, Paul de Kock, Victor Hugo, E. Girardin, G. Sand,  Lamartine, Valery's L'Italie, Goethe, Schiller, Thiers, A. Dumas,  Moliere, all the German philosophers, and Henry Stephens's Greek  Dictionary.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ABBE LACORDAIRE has published an introduction to a work entitled _Le  Monde Occulte_--an exposition of the mysteries of magnetism, by means of  somnambulism.           *       *       *       *       *    A BOOK which contains some excellent sketches relative to MAZZINI and  the Roman Republic, has been published at Bremen, with the title, _Des  Republikaner's Schwerdfahrt_, (The Republican's Sword-Pilgrimage). The  author is a German, Ernst Hang, who held a high post in the Roman army.  He is now in Asia Minor, where his work was written. It is eloquent  sometimes, and entertaining and sensible always. His remarks on the  mutual relations of Germany and Italy, are admitted to be sound and  judicious.           *       *       *       *       *    THE HON. CHARLES A. MURRAY, author of a volume of Travels in America,  and of three or four novels, is now the British Consul-General in Egypt,  and with his newly-married wife was to depart for Alexandria, to resume  his consular duties, towards the close of January.           *       *       *       *       *    THE first volume of a most valuable and interesting work has just made  its appearance at Frankfort-on-the-Main. It is called _Geschichte der  Frauen_ (History of Woman), and is from the pen of G. Jung. The volume  now issued contains the history of the oppression of woman, and her  gradual self-emancipation down to the Christian era. It is written with  great talent, and comprehensive learning, but without pedantry. The  author believes that the emancipation of woman is not yet completed, and  she has a right to a free development of her faculties, and a perfectly  independent position in society. Two more volumes will complete the  work.          The Fine Arts.      RICHARD WAGNER, well known as an artist, has brought out at Leipzic a  book called _Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft_ (Art in the Future), which  excites a good deal of attention, and is soundly assailed by those who  dislike it. Wagner adopts the philosophical ideas of Feuerbach, and  treats his subject from that stand-point. Into modern art he pitches  with all the force of a genuine iconoclast. He says it is a sexless,  sterile product of dreams, not art, but merely manner, &c. With him art  must come out of the people, and be the apotheosis of the people. The  people are immortal and ever young. With the poets and novel-writers of  the day, Wagner has no more patience than with the artists. They are, he  thinks, dilettanti, sentimentalists, who coquet with the misery of the  masses, in order to serve the same up well spiced and warmed to their  luxurious and fashionable readers. The ideal and absolute in art he  finds in the drama, which is the sum and type of all other artistic  creations. But no drama yet produced satisfies him, and he tells the  reasons why without hesitation. Those who wish to be entertained and set  thinking by an author who is in earnest even when most paradoxical, may  look at Wagner's book with advantage.           *       *       *       *       *    THORWALDSEN.--The Danish Government some time since sent Mr. Thiele, a  competent person, to Rome, for the purpose of collecting every thing  that could be obtained toward a history of the life and works of this  illustrious sculptor, whose early life is so obscure that even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#14)"],[1,"on special duty. In 1885 he served as  Deputy-Assistant-Adjutant and Quarter-Master-General, organising and  commanding the Mounted Infantry in the Burmese Expedition. Being  honourably mentioned in dispatches for his services with the Chin Field  Force, he received a brevet-colonelcy. In 1889-90 he was given a brigade  in the Chin-Lusha Expedition, was again mentioned in despatches, made a  C.B., and received the thanks of the Government of India. He commanded a  brigade of the Waziristan Field Force in 1894-95 with like distinction,  but he will best be remembered in connection with the campaign on the  North-West Frontier of India in 1897-98, after which he was made a  K.C.B. In 1898 he gave up his appointment in India and took command of  the British troops in Natal.    He was one of the best shots in the army, his military hobby in fact  being musketry, though he was also a great authority on the subject of  mounted infantry. He was a keen sportsman, an excellent linguist. He was  highly respected by all who knew him. As an evidence of how he was  regarded by his brother officers, one may quote from the telegram which  was sent from Sir G. White to the War Office on the morrow of the battle  of Glencoe. The communication said: \"The important success is due to his  great courage, fine generalship, and gallant example, and the confidence  he gave to the troops under him.\"    Mr. Winston Spencer Churchill's remarks about him, in a letter to the  _Morning Post_, show how fully he was appreciated for his social as well  as for his military qualities.    \"So Sir Penn Symons is killed! Well, no one would have laid down his  life more gladly in such a cause. Twenty years ago the merest chance  saved him from the massacre at Isandhlwana, and Death promoted him in an  afternoon from subaltern to senior captain. Thenceforward his rise was  rapid. He commanded the First Division of the Tirah Expeditionary Force  among the mountains with prudent skill. His brigades had no misfortunes;  his rearguards came safely into camp. In the spring of 1898, when the  army lay around Fort Jumrood, looking forward to a fresh campaign, I  used often to meet him. Every one talked of Symons, of his energy, of  his jokes, of his enthusiasm. It was Symons who had built a racecourse  on the stony plain; who had organised the Jumrood Spring Meeting; who  won the principal event himself, to the delight of the private soldiers,  with whom he was intensely popular; who, moreover, was to be first and  foremost if the war with the tribes broke out again; and who was  entrusted with much of the negotiations with their _jirgas_. Dinner with  Symons in the mud tower of Jumrood Fort was an experience. The memory of  many tales of sport and war remains. At the end the General would drink  the old Peninsular toasts: 'Our Men,' 'Our Women,' 'Our Religions,' 'Our  Swords,' 'Ourselves,' 'Sweethearts and Wives,' and 'Absent Friends'--one  for every night in the week. The night I dined it was 'Our Men.' May the  State in her necessities find others like him!\"                             THE BATTLE OF REITFONTEIN    On the morning of the 23rd, thirty men of the 18th Hussars rode into  camp at Ladysmith, after having had some exciting adventures. The facts  were these. On the arrival at Glencoe camp of the news of the Boer  defeat at Elandslaagte, General Yule had detached a force to cut off the  flying Boers. Unfortunately, the Hussars who were sent out for this  purpose were themselves cut off, but at last, with the enemy at their  heels, succeeded in fighting their way down a dangerous pass, and  eventually effecting their escape. This, too, without the loss of a man!    To return to the great retreat. While General Yule was falling back to  effect a junction with General White, the latter officer conceived a  brilliant plan to ensure the safety of the returning force. He was aware  that Yule's column was marching _via_ the Helpmakaar road, Beith, and  the Waschbank and Sunday River Valleys, and therefore, to cover the  movement, he sent out a strong force to the west of the road. The force  consisted of the 21st, 42nd, and 53rd Field Batteries, 1st Devons, 1st  Liverpools, 1st Gloucesters, 2nd King's Royal Rifles (just arrived from  Maritzburg), 19th Hussars, 5th Lancers, Natal Carabiniers, Border  Mounted Rifles, and Imperial Light Horse.    The enemy was already strongly posted on the kopjes a mile and a half  west of the railway and two miles south-east of Modder Spruit station,  in all, some seven miles from Ladysmith. It was necessary, therefore, to  keep him well occupied, and divert his attention from the Dundee column.  On both sides firing soon commenced, but our guns were promptly  silenced. Then the British took up a position three-quarters of a mile  west of the railway, and for some twenty minutes kept up a heavy  artillery fire supplemented by sharp volleys from the infantry. Before  long the kopjes were cleared and the object of the British attack  accomplished. The main body of the Boers retired in the direction of  Besters, a point to the south of Ladysmith, where, in the circumstances,  it was more advisable for them to be. In this battle a great deal of  sharpshooting, especially at officers, took place on the part of the  foe, who also resorted to their old tactics of discharging their guns  and running away, again discharging them and again running--a trick they  had been mightily fond of in their dealings with the Zulus, and which  was calculated to tire out the fleetest antagonists. Colonel Wilford of  the 1st Gloucester Regiment was mortally wounded. Sir George White had a  narrow escape, as the Boers turned their artillery on the Staff, and  their first shell came screaming within fifteen yards of the General.  Captain Douglas, 42nd Battery, had also a marvellous escape, his horse  having been wounded and his haversack ripped open by a splinter. In this  smart engagement, as Sir George White in his official statement  declared, \"Our side confined its efforts to occupying the enemy and  hitting him hard enough to prevent his taking action against General  Yule's column.\" The manoeuvre, as we know, was eminently successful,  but was not executed without cost to those who assisted in it. The  following was the official list of the officers killed and wounded:--         1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment.--Killed:       Lieutenant-Colonel and Colonel Edmund Percival Wilford. 42nd       Battery Field Artillery.--Wounded: Lieutenant S. W. Douglas,       shell-graze of abdomen, slight. 53rd Battery Field       Artillery.--Major Anthony J. Abdy, shell-graze of right knee,       slight; Lieutenant Arthur Montague Perreau, bullet wound, right       leg, severe; Lieutenant George Herbert Stobart (from 34th       Battery), bullet wound, finger, slight. 19th Hussars.--2nd       Lieutenant A. Holford, bullet wound, slight. 1st Battalion       Gloucestershire Regiment.--Lieutenant Carlos Joseph Hickie,       slightly.    The Boers, triumphant, entered Dundee about the same time as General  Yule and his worn-out troops were being enthusiastically greeted in  Ladysmith. They attacked the Dundee Town Guard, putting it to flight,  and turned many civilians out of their houses. Later, they mounted two  big guns at Intintanyone, some 4500 yards from the Ladysmith camp, and  their energies pointed to further activities.                                      LADYSMITH    Here it may be as well to review the geographical position of this now  famous place. Ladysmith, as a position for purposes of defence, is very  badly situated. It lies in the cup of the hills, and stony eminences  command it almost in a circle. Towards the north is Pepworth's Ridge, a  flat-headed hill fringed at the base with mimosa bushes. North-east is  Lombard's Kop, which is flanked by a family of smaller kopjes. South of  this hill and east of Ladysmith is a table-headed hill called Umbulwana.  South of this eminence runs the railway through the smaller stations of  Nelthorpe and Pieters towards Colenso. To the west of Pepworth's Ridge  is Surprise Hill, and other irregular hills which rise from four to five  hundred feet on all sides. The place is watered by the Klip River, which  enters the valley between the hills on the west, twists gracefully in  front of the town, and turns away among the eastern hills before making  its way to the south. The position, commanded as it was on every hand,  was not an enviable one, but the glorious fellows who had fought in two  brilliant engagements were in no wise disconcerted.    [Illustration: OFFICER OF THE NINTH LANCERS.    Photo by Gregory & Co., London.]    Yet all were on the alert, for the Boers had now closed in round the  town, and an engagement was hourly expected. A little desultory fighting  took place, but when the British troops advanced, those of the Orange  Free State at once retired towards the border. The town, however, was  somewhat harassed for want of water, owing to the Boers having cut off  the main pipes. The inconvenience was merely temporary, as the Klip  River, which runs through the main position, was fairly pure, and  there were wells which could be made serviceable. A captive balloon was  inflated by the Royal Engineers, and was used for the purpose of making  observations, much to the annoyance of the Dutchmen, who had securely  perched themselves at points of vantage on the surrounding hills. They  were at this time on the north and east, having laagered south-east of  Modder Spruit and Vlaak Plaats, some seven miles from Ladysmith, and  were preparing to arrange a closely-linked chain of earthworks that  should effectually surround the garrison. An exchange of shots now and  then, however, was all that took place for a while between the  contending parties, though both sides were evidently gathering  themselves together for some definite move. The situation was thus  described by a captive in"]]]
