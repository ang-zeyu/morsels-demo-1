I was allowed to take her to water  while closely guarded by armed men. One day as I took her to  water I was spoken to by several, who said they were sorry for a  man like me, who appeared to be honest and peaceably disposed;  that they knew that I and many honest men were deluded by Joseph  Smith, the impostor. But they thanked God he would delude no more  people; that he would certainly be shot; that I had better quit  my delusion and settle down by the officer in command, who was  then talking to me, in Carroll County, and make a home for my  family; that I would never have peace or quiet while I remained  with the Mormons. I heard him through. Then I said:    \"No man has deceived me. I am not deceived by Joseph Smith, or  any other man. If I am deceived it is the Bible that has deceived  me. I believe that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, and I have  the Bible as my authority in part for this belief. And I do not  believe that Joseph Smith will be shot, as you seem to think. He  has not finished his work yet.\"    As I finished my remarks the officer became enraged, and said:    \"That is the way with all you Mormons. You might as well try to  move a mountain as to turn a Mormon from his delusion. Blow the  brains out of this fool!\"    In an instant several guns were leveled on me. I imagined I felt  the bullets piercing my body.    The soldiers would certainly have shot me down if the officer had  not immediately countermanded his order, by saying:    \"Hold on, boys, he is not worth five charges of ammunition.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"I am your prisoner, unarmed and helpless,  and I demand your protection. But if you consider there is any  honor in treating a man and an American prisoner in this way, you  may do it.\"    As we returned to camp the man said:    \"We will make it hot for the Mormons yet before we are done with  them, and if you have not got enough of them now, you will have,  and you will remember my words when it is too late to serve you.\"    \"I may,\" said I; \"when I do I will own up like a little man. But  until I am so convinced I will never turn my coat.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"you are not so bad, after all. I like a firm  man.\"    The Mormons were locked in the public schoolhouses and kept  without rations being issued to them. The grain fields and  gardens that belonged to the Mormons were thrown open to the  stock and wasted. Our cattle and other stock were shot down for  sport and left for the wolves and birds of prey to devour. We  were closely guarded, and not allowed to go from our quarters  without an escort. We were nearly starved for several days, until  I obtained permission to go out and bring in some of the cattle  that the soldiers had killed for sport. The weather was cold and  the snow deep, so the meat was good. I also got permission to  gather in some vegetables, and from that time, while we remained  prisoners, the men had plenty to eat, yet often it was of a poor  quality. While a prisoner I learned that the loud and self-  conceited men were of little account when danger stared them in  the face.    Arrangements had been made to carry the treaty into effect. It  was found necessary to send Gen. Wilson with five hundred men to  Adam-on-Diamond to compel the surrender and the signing of the  treaty, as had been done at Far West, and the people of that  place were to be treated just as we had been. I was recommended  to Gen. Wilson by the officer who had ordered his men to blow my  brains out, as a suitable man for a guide to Adam-on-Diamond. He  said that I was as stubborn as a mule, but still there was  something about me he respected; that he believed I was honest,  and certainly no coward. Gen. Wilson said:    \"Young man, do you live at Adam-on-Diamond?\"    \"I cannot say that I do; but I did once, and I have a wife and  child there that I would like to see; but as to a home, I have  none left.\"    \"Where did you live before you came here?\"    \"In Illinois,\" I answered.    \"You will soon see your wife and child. I shall start in the  morning with my division for Adam-on-Diamond. You are at liberty  to select two of your comrades and go with me as guide to pilot  us there. Be ready for an early start and report to my adjutant.\"    \"Thank you, sir, I will do as you request,\" said I.    The next morning I selected two good men. Brother Levi Stewart  was one, but I have forgotten who the other man was. The day was  cold and stormy, a hard north wind blowing, and the snow falling  rapidly. It was an open country for thirteen miles, with eighteen  inches of snow on the ground. We kept our horses to the lope  until we reached Shady Grove timber, thirteen miles from Far  West. There we camped for the night by the side of Brother Waldo  Littlefield's farm. The fence was burned for camp-fires, and his  fields of grain were fed to the horses, or rather the animals  were turned loose in the fields. After camp was struck I went to  Gen. Wilson and said:    \"General, I have come to beg a favor of you. I ask you in the  name of humanity to let me go on to Adam-on-Diamond to-day. I  have a wife and helpless babe there. I am informed that our house  was burned, and she is out in this storm without shelter. You are  halfway there; the snow is deep, and you can follow our trail\" - it  had then slackened up, or was snowing but little - \"in the morning;  there is but one road to the settlement.\"    He looked at me for a moment, and then said:    \"Young man, your request shall be granted; I admire your  resolution.\" He then turned to his aid, who stood trembling in  the snow, and said, \"Write Mr. Lee and his two comrades a pass,  saying that they have gone through an examination at Far West,  and were found innocent.\"    After receiving my pass I thanked the General for his humane act,  and with my friends made the journey, through the snow, to Adam-  on-Diamond. As we neared home the sun shone out brightly. When I  got in sight of where my house had been I saw my wife sitting by  a log fire in the open air, with her babe in her arms. Some  soldiers had cut a large hickory tree for firewood for her, and  built her a shelter with some boards I had had dressed to  weather-board a house, so she was in a measure comfortable. She  had been weeping, as she had been informed that I was a prisoner  at Far West, and would be shot, and that she need not look for  me, for she would never see me again.    When I rode up she was nearly frantic with delight, and as soon  as I reached her side she threw herself into my arms and then her  self-possession gave way and she wept bitterly; but she soon  recovered herself and gave me an account of her troubles during  my absence.    The next evening Gen. Wilson and his command arrived and camped  near my little shanty. I started at once to report to Gen.  Wilson. On my way to him I passed my friend McBrier, who had  trusted me for some cattle. I still owed him for them. I told him  why I had been unable to pay him, and wished him to take the  cattle back, as I still had all of them except one cow that had  died of the murrain; that it was an honest debt, and I wished to  pay it. I asked him to go to my shanty with me, and said he could  take what cattle were left and a black mare that was worth  seventy-five dollars, and an eight-day clock that was worth  twenty-five dollars, for my note.    \"I have not got your note,\" said he.    \"Who has it?\" I asked.    \"I do not know; I supposed you had it.\"    \"I never saw it since I gave it to you.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"my house was burned, and all my property either  burned or taken from me, and your note was in the house when it  was burned.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"it matters not with me. If you will take the  property and give me a' receipt against the note, so that it  cannot be collected the second time, I will settle the debt.\" He  then said:    \"I thought you were in the party that burned the house, and had  taken your note, but I am now satisfied to the contrary, and that  you are an innocent man. All I ask is for you to renew the note.  The property of the Mormons will be held to pay their debts and  the expenses of the war, and I will get my pay in that way. You  just renew the note, and that will settle all between us.\"    McBrier introduced me to a number of the soldiers as an honest  Mormon. This worked well in my favor, and pleased me much, for it  satisfied me more than ever that honesty was the best policy. I  had done nothing that I considered wrong. I did not have to run  and hide, or screen any act of mine from the public gaze.    My wife had been treated well personally during my absence; no  insults had been offered to her, and I was well pleased with  that. I was treated with respect by Gen. Wilson and his men.  True, I was associated with the people that had incurred the  displeasure of the authorities, and my neighbors were then  receiving fearful punishment for all they had done. The  punishment, however, was in a great part owing to the fault of  the people. When the Gentiles found any of their property they  became very abusive.    Every house in Adam-on-Diamond was searched by the troops for  Gentile property. They succeeded in finding very much of the  Gentile property that had been captured by the Saints in the  various raids they made through the country. Bedding of every  kind and in large quantities was found and reclaimed by the  owners. Even spinning wheels, soap barrels and other articles  were recovered. Each house where property was found was certain  to receive a Missouri blessing, that is to say, the torch, from  the troops.    The men who had been most active in gathering plunder had fled to  Illinois, to escape the vengeance of the mob, leaving their  families to suffer for their deeds.

Then Pharaoh called for Moses in haste and said, \"I have sinned against  Jehovah your God and against you. Now therefore forgive my sin only this  once, and pray to Jehovah your God to take away from me this deadly  plague.\" So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Jehovah, and  Jehovah made a very strong west wind to blow which took up the locusts  and drove them into the Red Sea; not a single locust was left in all  the land of Egypt. But Jehovah let Pharaoh's heart remain stubborn, so  that he would not let the Israelites go.    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that  there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, so dark that it may be  felt.\" So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven; and there was  complete darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days; no one could  see another, nor did any one move about for three days. But the  Israelites had light in their homes.    Then Pharaoh called Moses and said, \"Go, worship Jehovah; only let your  flocks and your herds stay behind; let your little ones go with you.\"  But Moses said, \"You must also give us animals for sacrifices and  burnt-offerings, that we may offer a sacrifice to Jehovah our God. Our  cattle too must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must  take these to offer to Jehovah our God, and we do not know what we must  offer to Jehovah until we arrive there.\"    But Jehovah let Pharaoh's heart remain stubborn, and he would not let  them go. And Pharaoh said to him, \"Go away from me; take care that you  never come to me again; for on the day that you come to me you shall  die.\" Moses replied, \"You have spoken truly, I shall never see you  again.\"    Moses said to Pharaoh, \"Jehovah declares: 'About midnight I will go  through all of Egypt. All the eldest sons in the land of Egypt shall  die, from the eldest son of Pharaoh who sits upon his throne, even to  the eldest son of the slave girl who is behind the mill, and all the  first-born of the cattle. There shall be a great cry of sorrow all over  the land of Egypt, such as has never been before and never shall be  again.' But not a single dog shall bark at any of the Israelites nor  their animals, that you may know that Jehovah does make a difference  between the Egyptians and Israelites. All these your servants shall come  to me and bow down before me, saying, 'Go away, together with all the  people that follow you.' After that I will go away.\" And Moses went from  Pharaoh in great anger.      THE ESCAPE FROM EGYPT    Moses called together all the leaders of Israel, and said to them, \"Take  lambs from the herds according to your families and kill the passover  lamb. You shall also take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood  that is in the basin and strike the lintel and the two door posts with  the blood that is in the basin. And not one of you shall go out of the  door of his house until morning, for Jehovah will pass through to kill  the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood upon the lintel and on the two  door posts, he will pass over the door and will not let the destroyer  come into your houses to destroy you. You and your children shall  observe this event as a custom forever.    \"When your children shall say to you, 'What do you mean by this  service?' you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of the passover of  Jehovah, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when  he destroyed the Egyptians and released our people.'\"    Then the people bowed their heads and worshipped; and the Israelites  went and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron.    At midnight Jehovah destroyed all the eldest sons in the land of Egypt,  from the eldest son of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the eldest son  of the captive who was in prison. Then Pharaoh arose in the night,  together with all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a  great cry of sorrow, for there was not a house in Egypt in which there  was not one dead. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron at night and said, \"Go  away from among my people, both you and the Israelites; go, worship  Jehovah as you have asked. Also take with you your sheep and your  cattle, as you have asked, go and ask a blessing for me also.\" The  Egyptians also told the people to hasten out of the land, for they said,  \"We shall all perish.\" So the people took their dough before the yeast  had worked, and their kneading-troughs were bound up in their clothes  upon their shoulders.    The Israelites went on foot from Rameses to Succoth; and a mixed  multitude went with them, and they had a great many flocks and herds.  They baked unraised cakes of the dough which they had brought with them  from Egypt, for there was no yeast in it, because they had been driven  out of Egypt and could not wait, neither had they prepared for  themselves any food for the journey.    And they went from Succoth and camped at Etham on the border of the  wilderness. Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to  show them the way, and at night in a pillar of fire, to give them light,  that they might march both by day and by night; the pillar of cloud by  day and the pillar of fire at night stayed in front of the people.    When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the feeling of  Pharaoh and his servants toward them was changed, and they said, \"Why  have we done this and let the Israelites escape from serving us?\" So he  made ready his chariot and took his people with him. He also took six  hundred chosen chariots and the rest of the chariots of Egypt with  captains over all of them; and Jehovah let the heart of Pharaoh, king of  Egypt, remain stubborn, so that he followed the Israelites, because they  had defied him.    When Pharaoh drew near to them the Israelites looked up and saw the  Egyptians marching after them; and they were very much afraid and cried  to Jehovah. And they said to Moses, \"Why have you misled us by bringing  us out of Egypt? Is not this what we told you in Egypt, when we said,  'Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it is better for us  to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.'\" But Moses said  to the people, \"Do not be frightened, remain quiet and you will see how  Jehovah will save you to-day; for as surely as you now see the Egyptians  you shall never see them again. Jehovah will fight for you, and you are  to keep still.\"    Then the angel of God who went before the army of Israel changed his  position and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also changed its  position from in front of them and stood behind them, coming between the  army of the Egyptians and the army of the Israelites. On the one side  the cloud was dark and on the other side it lighted up the night, so  that throughout all the night neither army came near the other.    Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah by means of  a strong east wind caused the sea to go back all that night and made the  bed of the sea dry. And the Israelites crossed over on the dry bed of  the sea. The Egyptians followed and all of Pharaoh's horses, his  chariots, and his horsemen went after them into the sea. In the morning  before sunrise, Jehovah looked out through the pillar of fire and of  cloud upon the army of the Egyptians and threw them into confusion. He  also bound their chariot wheels, so that they dragged heavily. Therefore  the Egyptians said, \"Let us flee from the Israelites, for Jehovah fights  for them against us.\"    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Stretch out your hand over the sea, that  the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and  upon their horsemen.\" So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and  toward morning the sea returned to its ordinary level while the  Egyptians were flying before it. So Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in  the midst of the sea, and the waters returned and covered the chariots  and the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that went after them into  the sea, so that not one of them was left. Thus Jehovah saved the  Israelites that day from the power of the Egyptians; and they saw the  Egyptians dead upon the seashore. When the Israelites saw the great work  which Jehovah did to the Egyptians, the people feared Jehovah and  believed in him and in his servant Moses.    And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her  hand; and as all the women followed her with tambourines and with  dancing, she sang with them:            \"Sing to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously:           Both horse and rider has he hurled into the sea.\"    Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Jehovah:            \"I will sing to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously:           Both horse and rider he has hurled into the sea.           Jehovah is my strength and song, he has delivered me;           He is my God, I will praise him; my father's God whom I honor.\"      GOD'S COMMANDS TO THE PEOPLE    Moses led the Israelites forward from the Red Sea until they came to the  wilderness of Sinai, and there the Israelites camped before the  mountain.    Moses went up into the presence of God, and Jehovah called to him from  the mountain and said, \"Tell the Israelites: 'You have seen what I did  to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to  myself. Now therefore, if you will listen to my voice and keep your  solemn agreement with me, you shall be my own treasure taken from among  all peoples, for all the earth is mine. You shall be a nation of  priests, a people devoted to my service.'\"    So Moses called together the leaders of the people and told them all  these words, as Jehovah had commanded him. And all the people answered  together, \"We will do all that Jehovah has commanded.\"    When Moses told Jehovah the answer of the people, Jehovah said to him,  \"See, I come to"]]]
