Keeping the enemy at bay, the English  marched to the vessels, which had arrived at Pequot Harbor, and, placing  the wounded on board, continued their march to Saybrook. The remnant of  the Pequots sought to escape from the country, moving westward along the  Sound. Captain Stoughton, sent with one hundred and twenty Massachusetts  men, was guided by the Narragansets to a swamp in which a little band of  those hostile savages had hidden. The men were slain, offering little  resistance. The women and children were divided among the Indian allies  or sold into slavery by the colonists of Massachusetts Bay.    Mason and Stoughton together sailed from Saybrook along the shore, while  Uncas with his men tracked the fugitives by land. At Guilford a Pequot  sachem was entrapped, shot, and his head thrust into the crotch of an  oak-tree near the harbor, giving the place the name of Sachem's Head.  Near the town of Fairfield a last stand was made by the hunted redskins,  in a swamp, to which the English were guided by a renegade Pequot. The  tribe with whom the Pequots had taken shelter, also the women and  children, were allowed to give themselves up. The men were shot down or  broke through and escaped. The wife of Mononotto fell into the hands of  the English. This Indian squaw had once shown kindness to two captive  girls, and by Winthrop's orders she was kindly treated in return. The  Pequots, once so powerful, were well-nigh exterminated. Those taken  prisoners were spared only to be held in bondage, Mononotto's wife with  the rest. Some were absorbed by the Narragansets, others by the  Mohegans, while the settlers of Connecticut, upon whom the war had  fallen so heavily, came into possession of the Pequot land.    [l638]    For nearly forty years the New England colonies were not again molested,  the merciless vigor with which they had fought making a lasting  impression upon their blood-thirsty foes. The cruel slavery to which the  surviving natives were subjected, the English justified by the example  of the Jews in their treatment of the Canaanites.    [Illustration: Signature of Miantonomoh.]    [1642]    The Narraganset chief, Miantonomoh, had become the friend and ally of  the English by a treaty ratified in 1636, mainly through the good  offices of Roger Williams, In 1638, after the destruction of the  Pequots, there was a new treaty, embracing Uncas with his bold Mohegans,  and stipulating that any quarrel between Miantonomoh and Uncas should be  referred to the English. In 1642 Miantonomoh was accused of plotting  against the English, and summoned before the General Court at Boston.  Though acquitted he vowed revenge upon Uncas as the instigator of the  charge. His friendship for Roger Williams, as also for Samuel Gorton,  the purchaser of Shawomet, or Warwick, R. I., which was claimed by  Massachusetts, had perhaps created a prejudice against him. At any rate,  when a quarrel arose between Uncas and Sequasson, Miantonomoh's friend  and ally, while the latter naturally sided with Sequasson, the  sympathies of the English were with Uncas, who had aided them against  the Pequots. With the consent of Connecticut and Massachusetts  Miantonomoh took the field against Uncas, who had attacked Sequasson. He  was defeated and taken prisoner. Carried to Hartford he was held to  await the decision of the Commissioners of the United Colonies at  Boston. They would not release him, yet had no valid ground for putting  him to death. The case was referred to five clergymen, and they voted  for his execution. For this purpose the commissioners gave orders to  turn the brave warrior over to Uncas, English witnesses to be present  and see that no cruelty was perpetrated. The sentence was carried into  effect near Norwich. Cutting a piece of flesh from the shoulder of his  murdered enemy, Uncas ate it with savage relish, declaring it to be the  sweetest meat he had ever tasted.    [Illustration: The Grave of Miantonomoh.]    [1640-1643]    The Dutch, too, as we have to some extent seen already, felt the horrors  of Indian warfare. Kieft, the Dutch director-general, a man cruel,  avaricious, and obstinate, angered the red men by demanding tribute from  them as their protector, while he refused them guns or ammunition. The  savages replied that they had to their own cost shown kindness to the  Dutch when in need of food, but would not pay tribute. Kieft attacked.  Some of the Indians were killed and their crops destroyed. This roused  their revengeful passions to the utmost. The Raritan savages visited the  colony of De Vries, on Staten Island, with death and devastation. Reward  was offered for the head of anyone of the murderers. An Indian never  forgot an injury. The nephew of one of the natives who twenty years  before had been wantonly killed went to sell furs at Fort Amsterdam, and  while there revenged his uncle's murder by the slaughter of an  unoffending colonist. Spite of warlike preparations by Kieft and his  assembly in 1641-42, the tribe would not give up the culprit. The  following year another settler was knifed by a drunken Indian.  Wampum  was indeed offered in atonement, while an indignant plea was urged by  the savages against the liquor traffic, which demoralized their young  men and rendered them dangerous alike to friend and foe. But  remonstrance and blood-money could not satisfy Kieft. At Pavonia and at  Corlaer's Hook [footnote: now in the New York City limits, just below  Broadway Ferry, East River] the Dutch fell venomously upon the sleeping  and unsuspecting enemy. Men, women, and children were slaughtered, none  spared. In turn the tribes along the lower Hudson, to the number of  eleven, united and desperately attacked the Dutch wherever found. Only  near the walls of Fort Amsterdam was there safety. The governor  appointed a day of fasting, which it seems was kept with effect. The  sale of liquor to the red men was at last prohibited, and peace for a  time secured.    Soon, however, the redskins along the Hudson were again up in arms. The  noted Underhill, who with Mason had been the scourge of the Pequots,  came to the fight with fifty Englishmen as allies of the Dutch. Not  waiting to be attacked, the Indians laid waste the settlements, even  threatening Fort Amsterdam itself. At a place now known as Pelham Neck,  near New Rochelle, lived the famous but unfortunate Mrs. Hutchinson, a  fugitive from the persecuting zeal of Massachusetts. Here the implacable  savages butchered her and her family in cold blood. Her little  granddaughter alone was spared, and led captive to a far-off wigwam  prison. Only at Gravesend, on Long Island, was a successful stand made,  and that by a woman, Lady Deborah Moody, another exile from religious  persecution, who with forty stout-hearted men defended her plantation  and compelled the savages to beat a retreat.    [1645]    The colony was in extremity. New Haven refused to aid, because, as a  member of the New England confederacy, it could not act alone, and  because it was not satisfied that the Dutch war was just. An appeal was  made by Kieft's eight advisers to both the States-General and the West  India Company in Holland. The sad condition of the colonists was fully  set forth, and the responsibility directly ascribed to the mismanagement  of Kieft. At the same time, undismayed by the gloomy outlook, the  courage of the sturdy Dutchmen rose with the emergency. Small parties  were sent out against the Connecticut savages in the vicinity of  Stamford. Indian villages on Long Island were surprised and the natives  put to the sword. In two instances at least the victors disgraced  humanity by torturing the captured.    In these engagements Underhill was conspicuous and most energetic.  Having made himself familiar with the position of the Indians near  Stamford, he sailed from Manhattan with one hundred and fifty men,  landed at Greenwich, and, marching all day, at midnight drew near the  enemy. His approach was not wholly unannounced, for the moon was full.  The fight was desperate and bloody. The tragedy that had made memorable  the banks of the Mystic in the destruction of the Pequot fort was now  almost equalled. After the example of his old comrade Mason, Underhill  fired the village. By flame, shot, or sword more than five hundred human  beings perished.    While New Netherland was awaiting some message of cheer from Holland, a  company of Dutch soldiers came from Curacoa, but they did little to  follow up the successes already gained. Again the Eight sent a memorial  to the company, boldly condemning the conduct of the director and  demanding his recall. Their remonstrances were at last heeded, and the  removal of the unpopular governor resolved upon. In 1647 Kieft set sail  for Holland, but the ship was wrecked, and he with nearly all on board  was drowned.    It was high time for a change. In the two years, 1643-45, while sixteen  hundred Indians had been slain, Manhattan had become nearly depopulated.  In 1645 peace was concluded, not only with the smaller tribes in the  vicinity, but also with the powerful Mohawks about Fort Orange, and  finally with all the Indians belonging to the Five Nations or  acknowledging their authority. A pleasing incident of this treaty was  the promise of the Indians to restore the eight-year-old granddaughter  of Mrs. Hutchinson, a promise which they faithfully performed in 1646.  The great compact was made under the shadow of the Fort Amsterdam walls,  and the universal joy was expressed by a day of thanksgiving.    [Illustration: Totem or Tribe Mark of the Five Nations.]    [1650-1660]    An interval of peace for ten years was now enjoyed, when the killing of  a squaw for stealing some peaches led to an attack by several hundred of  the infuriated savages upon New Amsterdam.

They were a sub-tribe of the Hawazin and  sister tribe to the Bani Adwan, Ghatafan, and Suleim. They (the Bani  Sakeef) lived at Tayif and worshipped the idol _Lat_ or _Taqhia_. Orwa,  a chief of Tayif, had gone to Medina to embrace Islam. His first  generous impulse was to return to Tayif and invite his fellow-citizens  to share in the blessings imparted by the new faith. Upon his making  public his conversion, he was wounded by a mob and suffered martyrdom.  But he left a favourable impression of Islam at Tayif. Their deputation  consisted of six chiefs with fifteen or twenty followers. The Prophet  received them gladly and pitched a tent for their accommodation in the  court of his mosque. Every evening after supper he paid them there a  visit and instructed them in the faith till it was dark. Sir W. Muir  writes:--\"The martyrdom of Orwa compromised the inhabitants of Tayif,  and forced to continue the hostile course they had previously been  pursuing. But they began to suffer severely from the marauding attacks  of Bani Hawazin under Malik. That chief, according to his engagement,  maintained the increasing predatory warfare against them.\"--Life of  Mahomet, Vol. IV, page 204. At page 155 he says regarding Malik,--\"being  confirmed in his chiefship he engaged to maintain a constant warfare  with the citizens of Tayif.\" But there was no such engagement with  Malik. The authority (Hishamee) referred to by Sir W. Muir does not  speak anything of the alleged engagement. _Vide_ Hishamee, page 879.  Hishamee has only so much that Mohammad made Malik chief of those who  were converted from the tribe. These were the clans of Somala, Salma,  and Fahm, and that he used to fight with them against the Sakifites. Sir  W. Muir further writes that the inhabitants of Tayif said among  themselves: \"We have not strength to fight against the Arab tribe all  around that have plighted their faith to Mahomet, _and bound themselves  to fight in his cause_\" (Vol. IV, p. 205). The italics are mine and  these words are not to be found in the original authorities. Hishamee  (page 914) has _Bayaoo va Aslamoo_, _i.e._, they have plighted and  submitted (or converted to Islam).]    [Footnote 118: Descendants of the Kozaa inhabited the hills of that name  (Salaman).]    [Footnote 119: Descendants and branch of Bakr bin Wail.]    [Footnote 120: A tribe of the Kahtanite stock from Yemen.]    [Footnote 121: The Bani Taghlib bin Wail were a tribe of the Moaddite  stock of Meccan origin and a sister tribe to the Bani Bakr bin Wail.  Their wars are famous in the annals of Arabia. The war of Basus has been  already alluded to under Bani Bakr. These tribes, the Bani Bakr and  Taghlib, were located in Yemama, Bahrein, Najd, and Tihama, but lastly  the Bani Taghlib had emigrated to Mesopotamia and professed the  Christian faith. The members of their deputation to Mohammad wore golden  crosses. When invited to Islam, they did not embrace it, but promised to  allow their children to become Moslems. Mohammad allowed them to  maintain unchanged their profession of Christianity. Their Christianity  was of a notoriously superficial character. \"The Taghlib,\" said Ali, the  fourth Khalif, \"are not Christians; they have borrowed from Christianity  only the custom of drinking wine.\"--Dozy _Historie_, i, 20.]    [Footnote 122: A clan of Kinda from the sub-tribe of Sakun at Yemen.]    [Footnote 123: The Bani Tamim were descendants of Tabikha bin Elyas of  the Moaddite stock.

The whole tribe now  embraced Islam. \"A deputation from the Bani Tay, headed by their chief,  Zeid-al-Khail, came to Medina to ransom the prisoners, soon after Ali's  expedition. Mahomet was charmed with Zeid, of whose fame both as a  warrior and a poet he had long heard. He changed his name to Zeid _al  Kheir_ (_the beneficent_), granted him a large tract of country, and  sent him away laden with presents.\"    Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, p. 178.]    [Footnote 125: They were a branch of Sad-al-Ashira of the Mazhij tribe  of the Kahtanite stock. They inhabited the sea-coast of Yemen.]      [Sidenote: All the conversions, individual and tribal, without any  compulsion.]    32. Thus all these tribal conversions and the speedy spread of Islam in  the whole of Arabia was accomplished without any resort to arms,  compulsion, threat, or \"the scymitar in one hand and the Koran in the  other.\" The Pagan Arabs, the Christians and the Jews, those who embraced  Islam, adopted it joyfully and voluntarily. Islam had been much  persecuted for many years from the third year of its Prophet's mission  to the sixth year after the Hegira--a period of about sixteen years, but  it flourished alike during persecutions and oppositions as well as  during periods of peace and security of the Moslems. It was the result  of Mohammad's staunch adherence to the uncompromising severity of his  inflexible principles of preaching the divine Truth and his sincere  belief in his own mission that he bore steadfastly all the hardships of  persecutions at Mecca and the horrors of the aggressive wars of the  Koreish and others at Medina, and persuaded the whole of Arabia, Pagan,  Jewish and Christian, to adopt Islam voluntarily.[126]    [Footnote 126: The rebellion of almost the whole of Arabia--wrongly  called apostasy--after the death of Mohammad was chiefly against the  Government of Abu Bakr, the first Khalifa of the Republic of Islam. No  such paramount power over the whole of Arabia was ever vested in the  chiefs of Mecca, and the Arabs were unaccustomed to this new form of  Government. They had neither rebelled against Islam, nor apostatized  from their religion, except a very few of them who had attached  themselves to Moseilama for a short time.]      [Sidenote: Mohammad was not favoured with circumstances round him.]    33. It was not an easy task for Mohammad to have converted the Arabs  from their national idolatry to a religion of pure and strict  monotheism. The aspect of Arabia was strictly conservative, and there  were no prospects of hopeful changes. The indigenous idolatry and  deep-rooted superstition, the worship of visible and material objects of  devotion,--idols and unshaped stones,--something that the eyes can see  and the hands can handle,--and the dread of invisible genii and other  evil spirits, held the Arab mind in a rigorous and undisputed thraldom.  Arabia was obstinately fixed in the profession of idolatry which the  Peninsula being thickly overspread, widely diffused and thoroughly  organized, was supported by national pride and latterly by the sword.         \"It was,\" writes Dr. Marcus Dods, \"certainly no hopeful task which       Mohammed undertook when he proposed by the influence of religion to       combine into one nation tribes so incapable of being deeply       influenced by any religion, and so irreconcilably opposed to one       another; to abolish customs which had the sanction of immemorial       usage; and to root out an idolatry, which, if it had no profound       hold upon the spiritual nature, was at least bound up with old       family traditions and well-understood tribal interests.\"[127]    The sacrifices made to, and the requirements essential to Islam, its  numerous positive prohibitions, the immediate repudiation of old  prejudices, the renunciation of all sorts of idolatry and superstition,  the throwing aside of favourite idols and the abandoning of licentious  rites and customs, the total abstinence from"]]]
