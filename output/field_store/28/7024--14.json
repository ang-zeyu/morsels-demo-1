Lawson said he was at our service, and was promptly hired to look after  our horses.    \"Any cougar signs back in the breaks?\" asked Jones.    \"Wal, there's a cougar on every deer trail,\" replied the elder Stewart,  \"An' two for every pinto in the breaks. Old Tom himself downed fifteen  colts fer us this spring.\"    \"Fifteen colts! That's wholesale murder. Why don't you kill the  butcher?\"    \"We've tried more'n onct. It's a turrible busted up country, them  brakes. No man knows it, an' the cougars do. Old Tom ranges all the  ridges and brakes, even up on the slopes of Buckskin; but he lives down  there in them holes, an' Lord knows, no dog I ever seen could follow  him. We tracked him in the snow, an' had dogs after him, but none could  stay with him, except two as never cum back. But we've nothin' agin Old  Tom like Jeff Clarke, a hoss rustler, who has a string of pintos  corraled north of us. Clarke swears he ain't raised a colt in two  years.\"    \"We'll put that old cougar up a tree,\" exclaimed Jones.    \"If you kill him we'll make you all a present of a mustang, an' Clarke,  he'll give you two each,\" replied Stewart. \"We'd be gettin' rid of him  cheap.\"    \"How many wild horses on the mountain now?\"    \"Hard to tell. Two or three thousand, mebbe. There's almost no ketchin'  them, an' they regrowin' all the time We ain't had no luck this spring.  The bunch in corral we got last year.\"    \"Seen anythin' of the White Mustang?\" inquired Frank. \"Ever get a rope  near him?\"    \"No nearer'n we hev fer six years back. He can't be ketched. We seen  him an' his band of blacks a few days ago, headin' fer a water-hole  down where Nail Canyon runs into Kanab Canyon. He's so cunnin' he'll  never water at any of our trap corrals. An' we believe he can go  without water fer two weeks, unless mebbe he hes a secret hole we've  never trailed him to.\"    \"Would we have any chance to see this White Mustang and his band?\"  questioned Jones.    \"See him? Why, thet'd be easy. Go down Snake Gulch, camp at Singin'  Cliffs, go over into Nail Canyon, an' wait. Then send some one slippin'  down to the water-hole at Kanab Canyon, an' when the band cums in to  drink--which I reckon will be in a few days now--hev them drive the  mustangs up. Only be sure to hev them get ahead of the White Mustang,  so he'll hev only one way to cum, fer he sure is knowin'. He never  makes a mistake. Mebbe you'll get to see him cum by like a white  streak. Why, I've heerd thet mustang's hoofs ring like bells on the  rocks a mile away. His hoofs are harder'n any iron shoe as was ever  made. But even if you don't get to see him, Snake Gulch is worth  seein'.\"    I learned later from Stewart that the White Mustang was a beautiful  stallion of the wildest strain of mustang blue blood. He had roamed the  long reaches between the Grand Canyon and Buckskin toward its southern  slope for years; he had been the most sought-for horse by all the  wranglers, and had become so shy and experienced that nothing but a  glimpse was ever obtained of him. A singular fact was that he never  attached any of his own species to his band, unless they were coal  black. He had been known to fight and kill other stallions, but he kept  out of the well-wooded and watered country frequented by other bands,  and ranged the brakes of the Siwash as far as he could range. The usual  method, indeed the only successful way to capture wild horses, was to  build corrals round the waterholes. The wranglers lay out night after  night watching. When the mustangs came to drink--which was always after  dark--the gates would be closed on them. But the trick had never even  been tried on the White Mustang, for the simple reason that he never  approached one of these traps.    \"Boys,\" said Jones, \"seeing we need breaking in, we'll give the White  Mustang a little run.\"    This was most pleasurable news, for the wild horses fascinated me.  Besides, I saw from the expression on our leader's face that an  uncapturable mustang was an object of interest for him.    Wallace and I had employed the last few warm sunny afternoons in riding  up and down the valley, below Oak, where there was a fine, level  stretch. Here I wore out my soreness of muscle, and gradually overcame  my awkwardness in the saddle. Frank's remedy of maple sugar and red  pepper had rid me of my cold, and with the return of strength, and the  coming of confidence, full, joyous appreciation of wild environment and  life made me unspeakably happy. And I noticed that my companions were  in like condition of mind, though self-contained where I was exuberant.  Wallace galloped his sorrel and watched the crags; Jones talked more  kindly to the dogs; Jim baked biscuits indefatigably, and smoked in  contented silence; Frank said always: \"We'll ooze along easy like, for  we've all the time there is.\" Which sentiment, whether from reiterated  suggestion, or increasing confidence in the practical cowboy, or charm  of its free import, gradually won us all.    \"Boys,\" said Jones, as we sat round the campfire, \"I see you're getting  in shape. Well, I've worn off the wire edge myself. And I have the  hounds coming fine. They mind me now, but they're mystified. For the  life of them they can't understand what I mean. I don't blame them.  Wait till, by good luck, we get a cougar in a tree. When Sounder and  Don see that, we've lion dogs, boys! we've lion dogs! But Moze is a  stubborn brute. In all my years of animal experience, I've never  discovered any other way to make animals obey than by instilling fear  and respect into their hearts. I've been fond of buffalo, horses and  dogs, but sentiment never ruled me. When animals must obey, they  must--that's all, and no mawkishness! But I never trusted a buffalo in  my life. If I had I wouldn't be here to-night. You all know how many  keepers of tame wild animals get killed. I could tell you dozens of  tragedies. And I've often thought, since I got back from New York, of  that woman I saw with her troop of African lions. I dream about those  lions, and see them leaping over her head. What a grand sight that was!  But the public is fooled. I read somewhere that she trained those lions  by love. I don't believe it. I saw her use a whip and a steel spear.  Moreover, I saw many things that escaped most observers--how she  entered the cage, how she maneuvered among them, how she kept a  compelling gaze on them! It was an admirable, a great piece of work.  Maybe she loves those huge yellow brutes, but her life was in danger  every moment while she was in that cage, and she knew it. Some day, one  of her pets likely the King of Beasts she pets the most will rise up  and kill her. That is as certain as death.\"        CHAPTER 6.    THE WHITE MUSTANG    For thirty miles down Nail Canyon we marked, in every dusty trail and  sandy wash, the small, oval, sharply defined tracks of the White  Mustang and his band.    The canyon had been well named. It was long, straight and square sided;  its bare walls glared steel-gray in the sun, smooth, glistening  surfaces that had been polished by wind and water. No weathered heaps  of shale, no crumbled piles of stone obstructed its level floor. And,  softly toning its drab austerity, here grew the white sage, waving in  the breeze, the Indian Paint Brush, with vivid vermilion flower, and  patches of fresh, green grass.    \"The White King, as we Arizona wild-hoss wranglers calls this mustang,  is mighty pertickler about his feed, an' he ranged along here last  night, easy like, browsin' on this white sage,\" said Stewart. Inflected  by our intense interest in the famous mustang, and ruffled slightly by  Jones's manifest surprise and contempt that no one had captured him,  Stewart had volunteered to guide us. \"Never knowed him to run in this  way fer water; fact is, never knowed Nail Canyon had a fork. It splits  down here, but you'd think it was only a crack in the wall. An' thet  cunnin' mustang hes been foolin' us fer years about this water-hole.\"    The fork of Nail Canyon, which Stewart had decided we were in, had been  accidentally discovered by Frank, who, in search of our horses one  morning had crossed a ridge, to come suddenly upon the blind, box-like  head of the canyon. Stewart knew the lay of the ridges and run of the  canyons as well as any man could know a country where, seemingly, every  rod was ridged and bisected, and he was of the opinion that we had  stumbled upon one of the White Mustang's secret passages, by which he  had so often eluded his pursuers.    Hard riding had been the order of the day, but still we covered ten  more miles by sundown. The canyon apparently closed in on us, so camp  was made for the night. The horses were staked out, and supper made  ready while the shadows were dropping; and when darkness settled thick  over us, we lay under our blankets.    Morning disclosed the White Mustang's secret passage. It was a narrow  cleft, splitting the canyon wall, rough, uneven, tortuous and choked  with fallen rocks--no more than a wonderful crack in solid stone,  opening into another canyon. Above us the sky seemed a winding, flowing  stream of blue. The walls were so close in places that a horse with  pack would have been blocked, and a rider had to pull his legs up over  the saddle. On the far side, the passage fell very suddenly for several  hundred feet to the floor of the other canyon. No hunter could have  seen it, or suspected it from that side.    \"This is Grand Canyon country, an' nobody knows what he's goin' to  find,\" was Frank's comment.    \"Now we're in Nail Canyon proper,\" said Stewart; \"An' I know my  bearin's. I can climb out a mile below an' cut across to Kanab Canyon,  an' slip up into Nail Canyon agin, ahead of the mustangs, an' drive 'em  up. I can't miss 'em, fer Kanab Canyon is impassable down a little  ways. The mustangs will hev to run this way."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#14)"],[1,"him insistent, she left her house one  morning, and for fifty ducats persuaded a baker's apprentice to marry  her, the pair to live separately, while the step would be used in  dismissing the poor count. If she had really been engaged to Handel, or  had loved him, she might have had a husband at less expense; and  probably a musician is a more valuable article than a baker's  apprentice.    During his long career in England, Handel was twice nearly married. In  one case the mother of the fair charmer objected to her daughter's union  with a \"mere fiddler.\" Handel drew back with becoming pride, and was  probably not much hurt. Certainly he never lost the magnificent appetite  for which he was famous. Soon afterward the mother died, and the  father, apparently put in control of the family by this event, stated to  the composer that there was now no objection to the match. But Handel  declined the offer, saying that it was too late. The situation was  different from that at Luebeck, and his musical career now stood in the  way of matrimonial ventures. At a later time he wished to marry a lady  of wealth and position, but, as she made it a condition that he should  give up his profession, he declined to pursue the match. None of these  women were of especial influence upon him or his music, and he composed  his long series of operas and oratorios in complete bachelor freedom.    Gluck owed much of his musical success to the aid of a woman. While in  Vienna, gaining fame by his earlier works in Italian style, he won the  interest and esteem of the ladies of the imperial court, among them the  Empress Maria Theresa. He was chosen to direct music at court festivals,  and after one of his later Parisian successes, the empress honoured him  with the post of court composer. Gluck's wife had not the position or  influence to help him in the musical side of his career, as Clara Wieck  did Robert Schumann, but in the cultivated atmosphere of the court he  found one woman who afterward aided him with all the force of her rank  and influence,--his pupil, Marie Antoinette, the future Queen of France.    Even at Vienna Gluck was planning the reforms in opera that were to  banish the prevailing vocal inanities from the stage, and make his name  immortal. He did not minimize the beauty of contemporary operatic music,  but claimed that it consisted merely of a set of conventional arias and  scenas, and that the music did not in any way emphasize or illustrate  the meaning of the words. As in the well-known sextet from \"Lucia,\"  which divides the sheep from the goats in our own day, the character of  the music was often directly at variance with the spirit of the words.  His memorable production of \"Orfeo,\" though not remodelling the world at  a single stroke, won a full triumph, and showed all music lovers the  force of the new theories.    [Illustration: MARIE ANTOINETTE]    It was the French attache, Du Rollet, actuated by a sincere admiration  of the Vienna master's works, who first proposed to have Gluck come to  Paris. One of the directors of the Royal Academy of Music, to whom Du  Rollet addressed himself, made the matter public in France, but did not  reply. After some time Gluck himself renewed the agitation for a  hearing, with no better results. That his work was understood is shown  by a note from the Academy to Du Rollet, wherein one of the directors  promises to accept Gluck's opera if he will contract to furnish six  more; for one such work would overthrow all the French operas produced  up to that time. Finding the directors unable to come to a decision,  Gluck appealed directly to the Dauphine Marie Antoinette, who gave the  necessary orders, removed all difficulties, and invited Gluck to the  city where she was to be his faithful friend and patroness through all  struggles and trials.    Of the success of Gluck in Paris, this is hardly the place to speak.  Through all the intrigues of his musical enemies, the queen remained a  firm adherent of the new school. The contest was long and fierce.  Singers left or pleaded some excuse at the last moment; rival composers  produced opera after opera in hope of eclipsing him; critics, for and  against, entered into a protracted war of words and wit; and finally  Gluck's opponents, under the lead of Madame Du Barry, brought in the  Italian Piccini, with the avowed intention of obliterating Gluck's fame.  Great as his genius was, he might have had a harder fight for justice  but for his firm friend at court. He always had access to the queen, and  was always accorded more respect at court than his rivals, Piccini or  Sacchini. Realizing the worth of his own works, he often laid himself  open to the charge of conceit, but the queen was ever ready to defend  him warmly.    Marie Antoinette was herself a composer, and no doubt Gluck's early  tuition was responsible for her musical attainments. Hers was not the  rank nor the period in which a woman could attempt to work in the larger  forms, but her songs were eminently successful. One of those, since made  familiar by a more modern setting, is reproduced for the benefit of the  reader. Its grace and charm will speak for themselves.    With Haydn and Mozart ranking among the married men, the next tonal  master who claims attention is the great Beethoven. He was a mental  giant endowed with intense emotional vigour,--hearing inwardly the  beautiful strains that he wrote down, dreaming of the millennium and  human brotherhood, and expressing in the most heartfelt terms his  yearning for the one and only love who would share his lot with him. Yet  when we come to search for this one and only love, we find that her name  is legion. We also find that Beethoven remained single through it all,  and never won a helpmate to guide his destinies and curb his  eccentricities. His love for women was pure and sincere, if not lasting,  and many indications of the strength of his passion are to be found in  the great works that bear his name.    That Beethoven stood in sore need of a wife to regulate his personal  habits may well be assumed. Probably there never was a lodger who was  more constantly in trouble than this irritable and absent-minded genius.  Wholly absorbed in his music, he never seemed to realize that thumping  the piano at all hours of the day and night might prove disagreeable to  his fellow boarders. Even when not playing, he would think out his great  themes, and fall into a fit of abstraction that might last for hours. He  would stand beating the time, or he would pace the room shouting out his  melodies with full voice. As an antidote to this excitement, he would  pour water over his hands at frequent intervals, regardless of the  damage to the floor and the ceiling below. He was fond of taking long  walks, which he would not omit in wet weather, and when he returned on  rainy days the furniture was sure to suffer. He indulged in the habit of  shaving at his window, to the great amusement of the people passing by,  and the intense chagrin of his landladies. As a result of these traits,  he was forced to make frequent changes of base, and at one time he was  paying rent in four different places at once.    The following story of Beethoven's absent-mindedness is vouched for by  Moscheles: \"When I came in early to find Beethoven, he was still abed;  but feeling wide-awake and lively, he jumped up and placed himself at  the window just as he was, in order to examine the 'Fidelio' numbers  which I had arranged. Naturally a crowd of boys gathered under the  window, whereupon he roared out, 'Now, what do those ---- boys want?'  Upon my pointing to his own scantily clad figure, he said, 'Yes, yes,  you are quite right,' and immediately put on a dressing-gown.\"    Beethoven and his servants usually had hard times getting along with  each other. He was utterly careless and untidy, and the utmost confusion  reigned in his room. \"Books and music were scattered in all directions,\"  says a visitor. \"Here the residue of a cold luncheon; there some full,  some half-emptied, bottles. On the desk the hasty sketch of a new  quartette; in another corner the remains of breakfast; on the pianoforte  the scribbled hints for a noble symphony, yet little more than in  embryo; hard by, a proof-sheet waiting to be returned; letters from  friends, and on business, spread all over the floor; between the windows  a goodly Stracchino cheese; on one side of it ample vestiges of a  genuine Verona salami; and notwithstanding all this confusion, he  constantly praised, with Ciceronian eloquence, his own neatness and  love of order!\" When something did go astray, he would complain bitterly  that everything was done to annoy him; but, after a few moments of  raving, he recovered his natural good humour.    Though never married, Beethoven was always in love. He had several  attachments during his youthful days in Bonn, though none were really  serious. Meeting again in later life with one of his early flames, the  gifted singer, Magdalena Willman, he begged her to become his wife, but  met with a refusal. \"He was very ugly and half crazy,\" she said  afterward in excuse. Most of the objects of his later affections were  women of rank and position, but in early years he fell a prey to the  charms of damsels in much more humble stations. According to his pupil,  Ries: \"Beethoven never visited me more frequently than when I lived in  the house of a tailor, with three very handsome but thoroughly  respectable daughters.\"    At twenty, he fell in love with Babette, daughter of the proprietress of  a coffee-house that he frequented. That Babette's charms impressed  others may be gathered from the fact that she afterward became the  Countess Belderbusch. Three years later, Eleonora von Breuning was the  recipient of his devotion, and he would no doubt have found a good wife  in her if she, too, had not finally married some one else.
