She said it, however, rather too innocently on this occasion.  Miss Farrar was not dull, and had suspected from the beginning who was  at the bottom of the mischief; indeed, it was easy enough by this time  to trace the noise to the right spot, for the kitten had begun to  scratch, and lifted up its voice in a series of emphatic wails,  evidently protesting vigorously against solitary confinement.    Miss Farrar walked straight to Honor's desk and opened it, when out  jumped Pete, purring with satisfaction, and arching his back as if in  expectation of petting. The teacher seized him by the scruff of the  neck and gave him to Janie Henderson, at the same time quelling the  unseemly mirth of her class with a withering glance.    [Illustration: THE LIBERATION OF PETE]    \"Carry this kitten back at once to St. Chad's,\" she commanded. \"Honor  Fitzgerald, you will learn two pages of Greek chronology, and repeat  them to me before school to-morrow morning. Lettice Talbot, take a  forfeit! Girls, I am astonished at you! Open your books instantly,  every one of you! Gwen Roby, read out your answer to Example 37.\"    Though Honor was popular with most of the members of her Form, she was  never on very good terms with Flossie Taylor. Flossie had a sharp  tongue, and liked to make sarcastic remarks; and though Honor would  promptly return the compliment, and often \"squash\" the other  completely, continual bickering did not promote harmony between the  pair. Flossie was occasionally capable of certain dishonourable acts,  which always drew upon her Honor's utmost indignation and scorn. The  latter could not tolerate cheating or copying, and spoke her mind  freely on the subject.    \"Well, I'm sure I'm not nearly as bad as you!\" Flossie retorted once.  \"You do the most outrageous things. I never mixed the French and  history exercises, nor dipped the chalk into the red ink!\"    \"It's worse to crib someone else's work,\" protested Honor, \"because  that's sneaky and underhand. What would Miss Farrar say if she knew you  wrote dates on a slip of paper and put it inside your dictionary, and  then copied them when you pretended you were only looking how to spell  a word?\"    \"Miss Farrar won't find out, and what the eye doesn't see the heart  doesn't grieve for!\"    \"But it's so mean!\"    \"You turning Mentor!\" sneered Flossie. \"Really! I wonder what we may  expect next? Come, girls, and hear our most righteous and  well-conducted Paddy preach a homily on 'How to be the pattern pupil'!\"    \"Paddy is quite right,\" declared Maisie Talbot, taking up the cudgels  for once on Honor's behalf. \"There's a difference between her way of  breaking rules and yours. She mayn't be exactly a shining example to  the class, but, at any rate, she's always square and above-board, and  that's more than I can say for you!\"    \"We're none of us saints,\" added Lettice, \"but we've never gone in for  cribbing at Chessington. No other girl in the Form ever does it.\"    It was not only as regards the question of fairness in her work that  Flossie failed to reach the standard of honour current in the Lower  Third. She had many little meannesses, so small in themselves as to be  hardly worthy of notice, yet enough in the aggregate to exhibit her  character unfavourably.    One morning, just as the girls were going to their desks, Maisie Talbot  suddenly remembered that it was Miss Farrar's birthday.    \"We ought to say something about it,\" she whispered to Lettice. \"I wish  we had thought of it before, and bought her some flowers. How stupid we  were to forget!\"    \"Are you sure it's her birthday? How do you know?\" asked Flossie, who  was standing near, and overheard.    \"I'm absolutely certain. I have her name in my birthday book,\" replied  Maisie.    Flossie said no more just then, but the moment Miss Farrar came into  the room she stood up and wished her \"Many happy returns\", in the name  of the whole Form, before either Maisie or Lettice had the opportunity  to say a word.    They were most annoyed to be thus forestalled.    \"It was our idea,\" protested Lettice afterwards. \"You didn't even know  it was Miss Farrar's birthday before we mentioned it.\"    \"And yet you calmly took all the credit, and made yourself the  mouthpiece of the class!\" exclaimed the equally indignant Maisie.    \"I suppose I had as good a right as anybody else to offer  congratulations,\" laughed Flossie. \"You should have brought yours out a  little quicker.\"    Flossie might be appreciated by her cousins, the Hammond-Smiths, and  their particular friends, the Lawsons and the Palmers, but she was  certainly not a favourite in her own Form. Nearly everybody had a  squabble with her upon some pretext. Even Janie Henderson, whose  retiring disposition involved her in few disputes with her  schoolfellows, found a cause for complaint. It was one of the ordinary  regulations that the girls should each take the office of warden for a  week in turn, the duties being to give out any necessary books, clean  the blackboard, distribute fresh pens and blotting-paper, and collect  any articles that might be left in the room after lesson hours. By  general custom all pencils, india-rubbers, or other stray possessions  were put into what was known as the forfeit tray, whence their owners  might reclaim them by paying the penalty of the loss of an order mark.  Each girl had her pencil-box, in which she was expected to keep her own  property; but many things were usually left lying about, and the warden  always made a careful search at one o'clock.    The most cherished object in Janie's desk was a little, pearl-handled  penknife, which she greatly valued. She guarded it zealously, lending  it as seldom as she could, and taking good care that it was always  returned to her immediately. One unfortunate day, however, she had been  sharpening her pencil at the close of the arithmetic lesson, and in the  preoccupation of correcting her answers she laid her treasure down, and  forgot all about it. She remembered it after dinner, and ran back to  the schoolroom to rescue it, but it was nowhere to be found.    \"It must have been put in the forfeit tray,\" she said to herself. \"I  shall get it to-morrow, though it will cost me an order mark, worse  luck!\"    She looked eagerly next morning when Miss Farrar produced the tray, but  her penknife was not among the lost property. She made a few enquiries  in the class, but nobody professed to have seen it, and she was obliged  to abandon it as hopelessly gone.    It must have been quite a week after this that one evening, when the  St. Chad's girls were sitting in the recreation room, Flossie pulled  her handkerchief from her pocket, and in so doing whisked out a  pearl-handled penknife. She stooped in a hurry to recover it, but it  had fallen under a little table, close to where Pauline Reynolds was  sitting, and the latter picked it up instead.    \"Hello! This is Janie Henderson's knife,\" exclaimed Pauline. \"Look  here, Janie! Isn't this the one you lost?\"    \"Of course it is,\" affirmed Janie. \"I can tell it by the small blade.  There's a tiny piece broken off at the end.\"    \"Where did you get it, Flossie?\" enquired    \"I found it when I was warden,\" replied Flossie. \"How should I know it  was Janie's?\"    \"You might have asked whose it was,\" said Maisie. \"You've no right to  pocket things when you're warden!\"    \"I wrote a 'Found' notice about it,\" declared Flossie.    \"I never saw any notice,\" put in Janie.    \"Where did you pin this wonderful paper?\" asked Pauline.    \"On the dressing-room door.\"    \"Where nobody would ever dream of looking!\" returned Maisie. \"Why  couldn't you put the knife on the forfeit tray?\"    \"I really don't know! What's the use of making such an absurd fuss  about trifles?\" said Flossie, linking her arm in Norah Palmer's, and  turning away.    \"I call them principles, not trifles,\" murmured Maisie; \"it's just on  the same lines as the cribbing, not quite open and square. I wish  Flossie had stayed at St. Bride's; I certainly don't consider her a  credit to St. Chad's.\"    The quarrels between Honor and Flossie occasionally rose to the level  of a miniature war. The latter never lost any opportunity of flinging  ridicule and contempt on all things Irish, and Honor, who resented a  slur on her native land more than a personal injury, could not keep her  hot temper within bounds. It was, of course, very foolish to take any  notice of Flossie's taunts, and so her friends reminded her.    \"The more you blaze up, the more she'll tease, of course,\" said Maisie.    \"Why can't you keep calm, and pretend you don't hear her?\" said  Pauline. \"She doesn't try it on with us.\"    \"You're such a set of stolid Anglo-Saxons!\" declared Honor. \"You never  get roused about anything.\"    \"It's bad form, my dear girl! Hysterics are out of fashion. We don't go  in for them at Chessington.\"    \"But you really are entertaining when you're aggressively Celtic,  Paddy!\" said Lettice. \"I own I can't resist taking a rise out of you  myself sometimes, just for the fun of seeing you explode.\"    \"You ought to have been born Red Indians!\" retorted Honor. \"I like  people with a little fire. What's the good of having feelings, if one's  not to show them?\"    \"You show them so hard,\" laughed Lettice, \"you make yourself quite  ridiculous! I'm sure I shouldn't think one of Flossie's silly jokes was  worth making any fuss about.\"    This was very excellent and practical schoolgirl wisdom, but  unfortunately Lettice preached a philosophy of stoicism to which Honor  had not yet attained. At the least provocation her fiery Irish blood  always asserted itself, and she would flare up, albeit she was  conscious that, by so doing, she was affording her enemy the keenest  satisfaction,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#14)"],[1,"insecure investment. The average Southerner of that period was no  enthusiast for Slavery. He was not unwilling to listen to plans of  gradual and compensated emancipation. But he could not be expected to  contemplate losing in a night property for which he had perhaps paid  hundreds of dollars, without even the hope of recovery. On this point it  was found absolutely necessary to give way to the Southerners, though  Franklin, for one, disliked this concession more than any other. It was  determined that \"persons held to service or labour\" escaping into  another State should be returned to those \"to whom such service or  labour may be due.\"    The last and on the whole the least defensible of the concessions made  in this matter concerned the African Slave Trade. That odious traffic  was condemned by almost all Americans--even by those who were accustomed  to domestic slavery, and could see little evil in it. Jefferson, in the  original draft of the Declaration of Independence, had placed amongst  the accusations against the English King the charge that he had forced  the slave trade on reluctant colonies. The charge was true so far at  any rate as Virginia was concerned, for both that State and its  neighbour, Maryland, had passed laws against the traffic and had seen  them vetoed by the Crown. But the extreme South, where the cotton trade  was booming, wanted more Negro labour; South Carolina objected, and  found an expected ally in Massachusetts. Boston had profited more by the  Slave Trade than any other American city. She could hardly condemn King  George without condemning herself. And, though her interest in the  traffic had diminished, it had not wholly ceased. The paragraph in  question was struck out of the Declaration, and when the Convention came  to deal with the question the same curious alliance thwarted the efforts  of those who demanded the immediate prohibition of the trade. Eventually  the Slave Trade was suffered to continue for twenty years, at the end of  which time Congress might forbid it. This was done in 1808, when the  term of suffrance had expired.    Thus was Negro Slavery placed under the protection of the Constitution.  It would be a grave injustice to the founders of the American  Commonwealth to make it seem that any of them liked doing this.  Constrained by a cruel necessity, they acquiesced for the time in an  evil which they hoped that time would remedy. Their mind is  significantly mirrored by the fact that not once in the Constitution are  the words \"slave\" or \"slavery\" mentioned. Some euphemism is always used,  as \"persons held to service or labour,\" \"the importation of persons,\"  \"free persons,\" contrasted with \"other persons,\" and so on. Lincoln,  generations later, gave what was undoubtedly the true explanation of  this shrinking from the name of the thing they were tolerating and even  protecting. They hoped that the Constitution would survive Negro  Slavery, and they would leave no word therein to remind their children  that they had spared it for a season. Beyond question they not only  hoped but expected that the concession which for the sake of the  national unity they made to an institution which they hated and deplored  would be for a season only. The influence of time and the growth of  those great doctrines which were embodied in the Declaration of  Independence could not but persuade all men at last; and the day, they  thought, could not be far distant when the Slave States themselves would  concur in some prudent scheme of emancipation, and make of Negro Slavery  an evil dream that had passed away. None the less not a few of them did  what they had to do with sorrowful and foreboding hearts, and the author  of the Declaration of Independence has left on record his own verdict,  that he trembled for his country when he remembered that God was just.                                        CHAPTER IV                           THE MANTLE OF WASHINGTON      The compromises of the Constitution, on whatever grounds they may be  criticized, were so far justified that they gained their end. That end  was the achievement of union; and union was achieved. This was not done  easily nor without opposition. In some cities anti-Constitutional riots  took place. Several States refused to ratify. The opposition had the  support of the great name of Patrick Henry, who had been the soul of the  resistance to the Stamp Act, and who now declared that under the  specious name of \"Federation\" Liberty had been betrayed. The defence was  conducted in a publication called _The Federalist_ largely by two men  afterwards to be associated with fiercely contending parties, Alexander  Hamilton and James Madison. But more persuasive than any arguments that  the ablest advocate could use were the iron necessities of the  situation. The Union was an accomplished fact. For any State, and  especially for a small State--and it was the small States that hesitated  most--to refuse to enter it would be so plainly disastrous to its  interests that the strongest objections and the most rooted suspicions  had eventually to give way. Some States hung back long: some did not  ratify the Constitution until its machinery was actually working, until  the first President had been chosen and the first Congress had met. But  all ratified it at last, and before the end of Washington's first  Presidency the complement of Stars and Stripes was made up.    The choice of a President was a foregone conclusion. Everyone knew that  Washington was the man whom the hour and the nation demanded. He was  chosen without a contest by the Electoral College, and would undoubtedly  have been chosen with the same practical unanimity by the people had  the choice been theirs. So long as he retained his position he retained  along with it the virtually unchallenged pre-eminence which all men  acknowledged. There had been cabals against him as a general, and there  were signs of a revival of them when his Presidency was clearly  foreshadowed. The impulse came mostly from the older and wealthier  gentry of his own State--the Lees for example--who tended to look down  upon him as a \"new man.\" Towards the end of his political life he was to  some extent the object of attack from the opposite quarter; his fame was  assailed by the fiercer and less prudent of the Democratic publicists.  But, throughout, the great mass of the American people trusted him as  their representative man, as those who abused him or conspired against  him did so to their own hurt. A less prudent man might easily have worn  out his popularity and alienated large sections of opinion, but  Washington's characteristic sagacity, which had been displayed so  constantly during the war, stood him in as good stead in matters of  civil government. He propitiated Nemesis and gave no just provocation to  any party to risk its popularity by attacking him. While he was  President the mantle of his great fame was ample enough to cover the  deep and vital divisions which were appearing even in his own Cabinet,  and were soon to convulse the nation in a dispute for the inheritance of  his power.    His Secretary to the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton. This extraordinary  man presents in more than one respect a complex problem to the  historian. He has an unquestionable right to a place and perhaps to a  supreme place among the builders of the American Republic, and much of  its foundation-laying was his work. Yet he shows in history as a  defeated man, and for at least a generation scarcely anyone dared to  give him credit for the great work that he really did. To-day the  injustice is perhaps the other way. In American histories written since  the Civil War he is not only acclaimed as a great statesman, but his  overthrow at the hands of the Jeffersonians is generally pointed at as a  typical example of the folly and ingratitude of the mob. This version is  at least as unjust to the American people as the depreciation of the  Democrats was to him. The fact is that Hamilton's work had a double  aspect. In so far as it was directed to the cementing of a permanent  union and the building of a strong central authority it was work upon  the lines along which the nation was moving, and towards an end which  the nation really, if subconsciously, desired. But closely associated  with this object in Hamilton's mind was another which the nation did not  desire and which was alien to its instincts and destiny. All this second  part of his work failed, and involved him in its ruin.    Hamilton had fought bravely in the Revolutionary War, but for the ideals  which had become more and more the inspiration of the Revolution he  cared nothing, and was too honest to pretend to care. He had on the  other hand a strong and genuine American patriotism. Perhaps his origin  helped him to a larger view in this matter than was common among his  contemporaries. He was not born in any of the revolted colonies, but in  Bermuda, of good blood but with the bar sinister stamped upon his birth.  He had migrated to New York to seek his fortune, but his citizenship of  that State remained an accident. He had no family traditions tying him  to any section, and, more than any public man that appeared before the  West began to produce a new type, he felt America as a whole. He had  great administrative talents of which he was fully conscious, and the  anarchy which followed the conclusion of peace was hateful to his  instinct for order and strong government. But the strong government  which he would have created was of a different type from that which  America ultimately developed. Theoretically he made no secret of his  preference for a Monarchy over a Republic, but the suspicion that he  meditated introducing monarchical institutions into America, though  sincerely entertained by Jefferson and others, was certainly false.  Whatever his theoretic preferences, he was intensely alive to the logic  of"]]]
