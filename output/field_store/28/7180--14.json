[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#14)"],[1,"Muhammadanism, the more  grievous are its defects and errors seen to be; but in the simplicity of  its mosques, which has nothing in common with the sordid barn-like  bareness too characteristic at one time of many places of worship in our  own land, there is much from which Christians might learn a useful  lesson.    Within a stone's throw of Bisheshwar's temple there is a host of  temples, none of them very large, some of them small, but most covered  with carving, to some extent for mere ornamentation, but chiefly for the  purpose of illustrating the objects of Hindu worship. If you visit them  you will see everything is accordant with the great shrine you have  left. You will see Shiva, sometimes seated on a bull, sometimes on a  dog; his hideous partner Durga, with her eight arms and her ferocious  look, indicating her delight in blood; Hanuman, the monkey-god, with his  huge tail; Krishna engaged in his gambols; Ganesh, the god of wisdom,  with his elephant head and protuberant belly; and many others beside.  Everything you see is wild, grotesque, unnatural, forbidding, utterly  wanting in verisimilitude and refinement, with nothing to purify and  raise the people, with everything fitted to pervert their taste and  lower their character; and yet, I must add, with everything to give a  faithful representation of the mythology prepared by their religious  leaders. The pundits who wrote the sacred books of the Hindus were men  of great talent, of abundant leisure; and it is a marvel to me, of which  I can give no explanation, how they spent their days in spinning the  wildest legends, and in setting forth their gods as performing the most  fantastic, capricious, foolish, and wicked deeds, when they had a clear  canvas before them, and might have filled it with something worthy of  our nature, and worthy of objects to be worshipped.    Aurungzeb's mosque has two lofty minarets, rising about a hundred and  fifty feet above its floor, and thus having from the river an elevation  of two hundred and fifty feet. From a boat on the river the visitor has  the nearest and most impressive view of the city, with its peculiarities  as the high place of Hindu worship. If he proceed to the top of one of  the minarets, which is reached by a steep, dark spiral stair, he will  have a most commanding and extensive view of the city, the river, and  the country for many miles around. He will see that while the streets in  the centre of the city are long and narrow, and have very lofty houses,  beyond these the roads widen, and many of the houses are poor and mean.  As his eye falls on the part beyond the most crowded portion, he will  observe here and there fine mansions with gardens around them, evidently  belonging to the wealthy portion of the community, but surrounded by  poor streets.    [Sidenote: RETURN TO THE EUROPEAN STATION.]    After seeing what I have endeavoured to describe, the traveller is well  pleased to get back to his boat, and to drop down the river to Raj Ghat,  the northern end of the city, where, after his fatigue, he is happy to  find a conveyance to convey him to the European station more than three  miles distant.    During my residence in Benares I often made this trip from Assi-Sungam  to Raj Ghat, generally in company with strangers. The last time I made  it I was accompanied by the late Dr. Norman McLeod of Glasgow, and the  late Dr. Watson of Dundee. They were greatly interested in what they  saw, and repeatedly said the reality exceeded their expectation. Dr.  McLeod was specially eager to see everything that could be seen, and in  his own strong genial way expressed the feelings excited by the strange  scenes before him.    I must press into the concluding part of this chapter, as concisely as I  can, some additional facts which call for special notice.    The city as it now stands is quite modern. Though foundations dug up,  and pieces of masonry seen in existing buildings, testify to its  antiquity, we are told by those who are best qualified to judge that  there is not a single house or temple the erection of which can be  relegated to a more remote period than the reign of Akbar, who was a  contemporary of our Queen Elizabeth.    Various estimates have been given of the number of temples. According  to the census of 1872 the number is 1,454. This does not include smaller  shrines in niches in the walls, which may be reckoned by thousands. The  temples are constantly increasing in number; at no previous period were  there so many as at present. Traders and bankers have prospered greatly  under our rule, and, if devout Hindus, they deem themselves bound to  devote a part of their wealth to the erection of a temple. A regard to  their honour as well as to their gods prompts them to this spending of  their money.    So far as I have been able to ascertain, the temples of Benares have  very little of either funded or landed property. The vast sum required  for the support of the priesthood comes mainly from the offerings of the  people.    The \"Imperial Gazetteer\" of India gives no account in its last census of  the castes of Benares, but we are sure that many thousands of the  inhabitants are Brahmans. They are greatly subdivided, and are so  different in rank and occupation that they keep as separate from each  other as if they had no caste in common. The Pundas officiate in the  temples; the Gangaputrs, the sons of the Ganges, minister at the  waterside; the Purohits are the family priests; and the Pundits, the  most esteemed of all, are the learned men who study the Shastres, and  expound them to the people as occasion requires. Hindus generally have  their Gurus, religious guides, who perform to them very much the work  done for Roman Catholics by father confessors. These may be family  priests, learned men; or, in the case of the lower castes, the lower  orders of Brahmans. A vast number of the sacred caste have nothing to do  with religious services. They are engaged in various businesses. A  considerable number are cooks in the houses of the wealthy, as from  their hand all can eat, while they in many cases would consider it an  intolerable insult to be asked to eat with their masters. Not a few are  beggars.    There are places in Benares to which people resort almost as much as to  the temple of Bisheshwar. Among these I may mention the tank of  Pishachmochan, a word meaning deliverance from demons, as bathing in it  is considered very efficacious in securing this end, and the temple and  tank of Durga at a place called Durgakund. At this latter place there  are many hundreds of monkeys--some say thousands, though this is  doubtless an exaggeration--which scamper about in all directions, and  fare well at the hands of Durga's worshippers. These animals are deemed  gods and goddesses, and woe to the person who does them any harm.    The monkeys are not the only animals deemed sacred at Benares. All who  have heard anything about the city have heard about the well-fed lazy  bulls prowling about the streets, and insisting on making free with the  goods of the vegetable and grain sellers. These are no longer to be seen  going about in their former fashion. I shall have something to say  afterwards about them.    [Sidenote: FESTIVALS AT BENARES.]    Mr. Sherring gives an account of forty melas, or religious festivals, in  the course of the year in Benares. The principal of these are the Holee,  the Saturnalia of the Hindus, the Ram Leela (the dramatic representation  of the life of Ram as given in the epic poem, \"The Ramayan\"), and the  Pilgrimage of the Panch Kosee, when the people make the circuit of the  city, and halt for the night at certain assigned stations. On the  occasion of eclipses vast numbers resort to Benares from all parts of  India.    Benares has long been considered the Oxford of India. Its learned men  have from ancient times been famed for their learning, and the aspirants  for Hindu lore--all members of the same caste with themselves--have from  generation to generation sat at their feet. They have had no grand  academic halls in which to give their prelections; they have taken no  fees from their pupils; they have met in very humble rooms, or in the  open air in a garden under trees; but both teachers and students have  been characterized by an assiduity and a perseverance which the most  laborious of German scholars rarely attain. The very modest requirements  of these learned men have as a rule been met unasked by the princes and  wealthy of the land.    In 1791, a very short time after Benares was brought directly under  British rule, a Sanscrit college was founded by the payment of certain  pundits, who were left to carry on their work unchecked by any  authority, or even suggestion, from without. It is said that pundits of  the highest repute refused to have anything to do with the foreigner. In  1853 a very fine Gothic structure, said to be the most imposing building  erected by the British in India, was opened under the name of the  Queen's College, for the accommodation of students in both Western and  Eastern learning. Here both English and Sanscrit are studied, and under  the first Principal, the late Dr. Ballantyne, vigorous, and I hope to  some degree successful, effort was put forth to infuse Western  literature, philosophy, and science into the pundit mind.    I have mentioned the number of Muhammadans residing at Benares. It is  officially stated they have 272 mosques, of which that of Aurungzeb,  with its lofty minarets, is the largest. Hindus must have looked with  horror on the sacrilegious deed by which this mosque was erected on the  site of the demolished temple of Bisheshwar; but the power of the bigot  emperor was so great that they could do nothing more than invocate  curses on his head. The close neighbourhood of this mosque to the most  frequented temple, and the remembrance of the building which formerly  occupied its site, have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#14)"],[1," Committee refuses to allow a Report to be made giving to the House  at this time upon grounds which are no doubt satisfactory to themselves;  therefore, I cannot report the evidence upon which my conclusion is  based, which I would gladly do did the Committee deem it expedient. The  examination of witnesses and the records was commenced, as appears by  the majority report, about the time of the reference, to-wit: on the 7th  day of January, 1867, and continued daily. A large number of witnesses  has been examined, and everything done that could be, to bring the case  to a close, as appears by the majority report: and the majority have  come to the conclusion \"that sufficient testimony had been brought  to its notice to justify and demand a further prosecution of the  investigation.\" I have carefully examined all the evidence in the case,  and do report that there is not one particle of evidence to sustain any  of the charges which the House charged the Committee to investigate,  and that the case is wholly without a particle of evidence upon which  impeachment could be founded, and that with all the effort that has been  made, and the mass of evidence that has been taken; the case is entirely  void of proof. I furthermore report that the most of the testimony that  has been taken is of a secondary character, and such as would not be  admitted in a court of justice.    In view of this conclusion I can see no good in a continuation of the  investigation. I am convinced that all the proof that can be produced  has been before the Committee, as no pains have been spared to give the  case a full investigation. Why, then, keep the country in a feverish  state of excitement upon this question any longer, as it is sure to end,  in my opinion, in a complete vindication of the President, if justice be  done him by the committee, of which I have no doubt,    A. J. Rogers.    The two reports were ordered printed and laid on the table.    This session of the House, and with it the Thirty-Ninth Congress, ended  a few hours later, the legislative day continuing till twelve o'clock,  noon, on Sunday, March 3rd. The House adjourned sine die at that hour,  when all unfinished business lapsed.    RENEWAL OF THE IMPEACHMENT.    The first session of the Fortieth Congress began on Monday, March 4th,  1867, and on the 7th, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Ashley (Rep.)  offered the following Preamble and Resolutions:    Whereas the House of Representatives of the Thirty-Ninth Congress  adopted, on the 7th of January, 1867, a Resolution authorizing an  inquiry into certain charges preferred against the President of the  United States; and whereas the Judiciary Committee, to whom said  Resolution and charges were referred, with authority to investigate  the same, were unable for want of time, to complete said investigation  before the expiration of the Thirty-Ninth Congress; and whereas in the  report submitted by said Judiciary Committee on the 2nd of March they  declare that the evidence taken is of such a character as to justify and  demand a continuation of the investigation by this Congress; therefore:    Be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the Judiciary  Committee, when appointed, be, and they are hereby, instructed to  continue the investigation authorized in said Resolution of Jan. 7th,  1867, and that they have power to send for persons and papers, and to  administer the customary oath to witnesses; and that the committee have  authority to sit during the sessions of the House and during any recess  which Congress or this House may take.    Resolved, That the Speaker be requested to appoint the Committee on the  Judiciary forthwith, and that the Committee so appointed be directed  to take charge of the testimony taken by the Committee of the last  Congress; and that said Committee have power to appoint a clerk at a  compensation not to exceed six dollars per day, and employ the necessary  stenographers.    At the close of the debate on Mr. Ashley's Resolution, it was adopted  without a division, its form being changed to the following:    Resolved, That the Committee on Judiciary be requested to report on  the charges against the President as aforesaid, on the first day of the  meeting of the House after the recess hereafter to be determined.    Congress adjourned a few days later. It re-assembled on the 3rd of July,  and on the 11th the following resolutions was offered by Mr. Stevens,  (Rep.) of Pennsylvania:    Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the  Resolution and Documents relative to the Impeachment of the President,  be directed to report the evidence at this session, with leave to make  further report if they shall deem proper.    That the impeachment enterprise was waning, and that its forces had  received little encouragement during the recess of the Congress that had  just closed, was evidenced by the fact that there could not be mustered  ayes enough to put the resolution to a vote, and Mr. Wilson, of Iowa,  moved the following substitute:    Resolved, That the Committee on Judiciary be, and they are hereby,  authorized and directed to have the usual number of copies of the  evidence taken by said committee relative to the Impeachment of the  President, printed and laid on the desks of Members of the House on the  first day of the next Congress, whether adjourned or regular.    The Resolution was adopted by a vote of 85 to 48, whereupon Mr. Stevens  dejectedly remarked that, \"after the vote which had been taken on this  resolution, indicating the views of a majority of the House in regard to  it, I am willing to abandon it. I therefore move that the Resolution as  amended be laid on the table,\" which motion was agreed to.    On the 15th of July, 1867, Mr. Farnsworth, (Rep.) of Illinois, offered  the following resolution and demanded the previous question thereon:    Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from  the further consideration of the question of the Impeachment of the  President of the United States, and that the testimony already taken by  said committee be printed for the use of the House.    The resolution was not seconded, and went over under the rules.    On the 25th of Nov. 1867, Mr. Boutwell (Rep.), on behalf of the  Judiciary Committee, submitted the report of the majority of that  committee, of the testimony taken in behalf of the proposed impeachment  of the President. The report recommended his impeachment.    Mr. Wilson, submitted the report of the minority of the Committee  (himself and Mr. Woodbridge), and moved the adoption of the following  resolution:    Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from the  further consideration of the proposed impeachment of the President of  the United States, and that the subject be laid upon the table.    Mr. Marshall, on behalf of himself and Mr. Eldridge, the two Democratic  members of the committee, stated that though they had not signed the  minority report submitted by Mr. Wilson, they joined in support of  the resolution submitted by him, and asked leave to introduce and have  printed separate views.    This, the first session of the Fortieth Congress, then adjourned, Dec.  2nd, 1867.    The second session of the Fortieth Congress was begun on the same day,  and on the 5th, the impeachment question came up in its order in the  House, on the resolution reported from the Judiciary Committee:    That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be impeached of  high crimes and misdemeanors.    After a brief discussion of the order of business, the House adjourned  for that day.    The debate was closed on the 6th, by Messrs. Boutwell and Wilson,  the members of the Committee on the Judiciary having Charge of the  impeachment measure. The closing passages of Mr. Boutwell's speech were  as follows:    What is our position to-day? Can this House and the Senate, with the  knowledge they have of the Presidents purposes and of the character  of the men who surround him, give him the necessary power? (to remove  alleged dishonest officials.) Do they not feel that if he be alloyed  such power these places will be given to worse men? Hence, I say that  with Mr. Johnson in office from this time until the 4th of March, 1869,  there is no remedy for these grievances. These are considerations why we  should not hesitate to do that which justice authorizes us to do if we  believe that the President has been guilty of impeachable offenses.    Mr. Speaker, all rests here. To this House is given by the Constitution  the sole power of impeachment; and this power of impeachment furnishes  the only means by which we can secure the execution of the laws, and  those of our fellow citizens who desire the administration of the law  ought to sustain this House while it executes that great law which is in  its hands and which is nowhere else, while it performs a high and solemn  duty resting on it by which that man who has been the chief violator of  law shall be removed, and without which there can be no execution of the  law any where. Therefore the whole responsibility, whatever it may be,  for the non-execution of the laws of the country, is, (in the presence  of these great facts) upon this House. * * * I think that we can not do  otherwise than believe, that he has disregarded that great injunction of  the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,  that there is but one remedy. The remedy is with this House, and it is  nowhere else. If we neglect or refuse to use our powers when the  case arises demanding decisive action, the Government ceases to be a  Government of law and becomes a Government of men.    Mr. Wilson, Chairman of the Committee, closed the debate in the  following remarks:    The gentleman from Massachusetts has remarked that the President may  interfere with the next Presidential election in the Southern States;  that he may station"]]]
