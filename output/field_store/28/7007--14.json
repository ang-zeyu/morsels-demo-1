Not only would the skill and speed demanded by modern industry be  impossible without the aid of habit, but without its help none could  stand the fatigue and strain. The new workman placed at a high-speed  machine is ready to fall from weariness at the end of his first day. But  little by little he learns to omit the unnecessary movements, the  necessary movements become easier and more automatic through habit, and  he finds the work easier. We may conclude, then, that not only do  consciously directed movements show less skill than the same movements  made automatic by habit, but they also require more effort and produce  greater fatigue.    HABIT ECONOMIZES MORAL EFFORT.--To have to decide each time the question  comes up whether we will attend to this lecture or sermon or lesson;  whether we will persevere and go through this piece of disagreeable work  which we have begun; whether we will go to the trouble of being  courteous and kind to this or that poor or unlovely or dirty  fellow-mortal; whether we will take this road because it looks easy, or  that one because we know it to be the one we ought to take; whether we  will be strictly fair and honest when we might just as well be the  opposite; whether we will resist the temptation which dares us; whether  we will do this duty, hard though it is, which confronts us--to have to  decide each of these questions every time it presents itself is to put  too large a proportion of our thought and energy on things which should  take care of themselves. For all these things should early become so  nearly habitual that they can be settled with the very minimum of  expenditure of energy when they arise.    THE HABIT OF ATTENTION.--It is a noble thing to be able to attend by  sheer force of will when the interest lags, or some more attractive  thing appears, but far better is it so to have formed the habit of  attention that we naturally fall into that attitude when this is the  desirable thing. To understand what I mean, you only have to look over a  class or an audience and note the different ways which people have of  finally settling down to listening. Some with an attitude which says,  \"Now here I am, ready to listen to you if you will interest me,  otherwise not.\" Others with a manner which says, \"I did not really come  here expecting to listen, and you will have a large task if you  interest me; I never listen unless I am compelled to, and the  responsibility rests on you.\" Others plainly say, \"I really mean to  listen, but I have hard work to control my thoughts, and if I wander I  shall not blame you altogether; it is just my way.\" And still others  say, \"When I am expected to listen, I always listen whether there is  anything much to listen to or not. I have formed that habit, and so have  no quarrel with myself about it. You can depend on me to be attentive,  for I cannot afford to weaken my habit of attention whether you do well  or not.\" Every speaker will clasp these last listeners to his heart and  feed them on the choicest thoughts of his soul; they are the ones to  whom he speaks and to whom his address will appeal.    HABIT ENABLES US TO MEET THE DISAGREEABLE.--To be able to persevere in  the face of difficulties and hardships and carry through the  disagreeable thing in spite of the protests of our natures against the  sacrifice which it requires, is a creditable thing; but it is more  creditable to have so formed the habit of perseverance that the  disagreeable duty shall be done without a struggle, or protest, or  question. Horace Mann testifies of himself that whatever success he was  able to attain was made possible through the early habit which he formed  of never stopping to inquire whether he _liked_ to do a thing which  needed doing, but of doing everything equally well and without question,  both the pleasant and the unpleasant.    The youth who can fight out a moral battle and win against the  allurements of some attractive temptation is worthy the highest honor  and praise; but so long as he has to fight the same battle over and over  again, he is on dangerous ground morally. For good morals must finally  become habits, so ingrained in us that the right decision comes largely  without effort and without struggle. Otherwise the strain is too great,  and defeat will occasionally come; and defeat means weakness and at last  disaster, after the spirit has tired of the constant conflict. And so on  in a hundred lines. Good habits are more to be coveted than individual  victories in special cases, much as these are to be desired. For good  habits mean victories all along the line.    HABIT THE FOUNDATION OF PERSONALITY.--The biologist tells us that it is  the _constant_ and not the _occasional_ in the environment that  impresses itself on an organism. So also it is the _habitual_ in our  lives that builds itself into our character and personality. In a very  real sense we _are_ what we are in the habit of doing and thinking.    Without habit, personality could not exist; for we could never do a  thing twice alike, and hence would be a new person each succeeding  moment. The acts which give us our own peculiar individuality are our  habitual acts--the little things that do themselves moment by moment  without care or attention, and are the truest and best expression of our  real selves. Probably no one of us could be very sure which arm he puts  into the sleeve, or which foot he puts into the shoe, first; and yet  each of us certainly formed the habit long ago of doing these things in  a certain way. We might not be able to describe just how we hold knife  and fork and spoon, and yet each has his own characteristic and habitual  way of handling them. We sit down and get up in some characteristic way,  and the very poise of our heads and attitudes of our bodies are the  result of habit. We get sleepy and wake up, become hungry and thirsty at  certain hours, through force of habit. We form the habit of liking a  certain chair, or nook, or corner, or path, or desk, and then seek this  to the exclusion of all others. We habitually use a particular pitch of  voice and type of enunciation in speaking, and this becomes one of our  characteristic marks; or we form the habit of using barbarisms or  solecisms of language in youth, and these cling to us and become an  inseparable part of us later in life.    On the mental side the case is no different. Our thinking is as  characteristic as our physical acts. We may form the habit of thinking  things out logically, or of jumping to conclusions; of thinking  critically and independently, or of taking things unquestioningly on the  authority of others. We may form the habit of carefully reading good,  sensible books, or of skimming sentimental and trashy ones; of choosing  elevating, ennobling companions, or the opposite; of being a good  conversationalist and doing our part in a social group, or of being a  drag on the conversation, and needing to be \"entertained.\" We may form  the habit of observing the things about us and enjoying the beautiful in  our environment, or of failing to observe or to enjoy. We may form the  habit of obeying the voice of conscience or of weakly yielding to  temptation without a struggle; of taking a reverent attitude of prayer  in our devotions, or of merely saying our prayers.    HABIT SAVES WORRY AND REBELLION.--Habit has been called the \"balance  wheel\" of society. This is because men readily become habituated to the  hard, the disagreeable, or the inevitable, and cease to battle against  it. A lot that at first seems unendurable after a time causes less  revolt. A sorrow that seems too poignant to be borne in the course of  time loses some of its sharpness. Oppression or injustice that arouses  the fiercest resentment and hate may finally come to be accepted with  resignation. Habit helps us learn that \"what cannot be cured must be  endured.\"      3. THE TYRANNY OF HABIT    EVEN GOOD HABITS NEED TO BE MODIFIED.--But even in good habits there is  danger. Habit is the opposite of attention. Habit relieves attention of  unnecessary strain. Every habitual act was at one time, either in the  history of the race or of the individual, a voluntary act; that is, it  was performed under active attention. As the habit grew, attention was  gradually rendered unnecessary, until finally it dropped entirely out.  And herein lies the danger. Habit once formed has no way of being  modified unless in some way attention is called to it, for a habit left  to itself becomes more and more firmly fixed. The rut grows deeper. In  very few, if any, of our actions can we afford to have this the case.  Our habits need to be progressive, they need to grow, to be modified, to  be improved. Otherwise they will become an incrusting shell, fixed and  unyielding, which will limit our growth.    It is necessary, then, to keep our habitual acts under some surveillance  of attention, to pass them in review for inspection every now and then,  that we may discover possible modifications which will make them more  serviceable. We need to be inventive, constantly to find out better ways  of doing things. Habit takes care of our standing, walking, sitting; but  how many of us could not improve his poise and carriage if he would? Our  speech has become largely automatic, but no doubt all of us might remove  faults of enunciation, pronunciation or stress from our speaking. So  also we might better our habits of study and thinking, our methods of  memorizing, or our manner of attending.    THE TENDENCY OF \"RUTS.\"--But this will require something of heroism. For  to follow the well-beaten path of custom is easy and pleasant, while to  break out of the rut of habit and start a new line of action is  difficult and disturbing. Most people prefer to keep doing things as  they always have done them, to continue reading and thinking and  believing as they have long been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#14)"],[1,"moisture. Hence, in swampy  places, alder piles driven close together beneath the foundations of  buildings take in the water which their own consistence lacks and remain  imperishable forever, supporting structures of enormous weight and  keeping them from decay. Thus a material which cannot last even a little  while above ground, endures for a long time when covered with moisture.    11. One can see this at its best in Ravenna; for there all the  buildings, both public and private, have piles of this sort beneath  their foundations. The elm and the ash contain a very great amount of  moisture, a minimum of air and fire, and a moderate mixture of the  earthy in their composition. When put in shape for use in buildings they  are tough and, having no stiffness on account of the weight of moisture  in them, soon bend. But when they become dry with age, or are allowed to  lose their sap and die standing in the open, they get harder, and from  their toughness supply a strong material for dowels to be used in joints  and other articulations.    12. The hornbeam, which has a very small amount of fire and of the  earthy in its composition, but a very great proportion of air and  moisture, is not a wood that breaks easily, and is very convenient to  handle. Hence, the Greeks call it \"zygia,\" because they make of it yokes  for their draught-animals, and their word for yoke is [Greek: zyga].  Cypress and pine are also just as admirable; for although they contain  an abundance of moisture mixed with an equivalent composed of all the  other elements, and so are apt to warp when used in buildings on account  of this superfluity of moisture, yet they can be kept to a great age  without rotting, because the liquid contained within their substances  has a bitter taste which by its pungency prevents the entrance of decay  or of those little creatures which are destructive. Hence, buildings  made of these kinds of wood last for an unending period of time.    13. The cedar and the juniper tree have the same uses and good  qualities, but, while the cypress and pine yield resin, from the cedar  is produced an oil called cedar-oil. Books as well as other things  smeared with this are not hurt by worms or decay. The foliage of this  tree is like that of the cypress but the grain of the wood is straight.  The statue of Diana in the temple at Ephesus is made of it, and so are  the coffered ceilings both there and in all other famous fanes, because  that wood is everlasting. The tree grows chiefly in Crete, Africa, and  in some districts of Syria.    14. The larch, known only to the people of the towns on the banks of the  river Po and the shores of the Adriatic, is not only preserved from  decay and the worm by the great bitterness of its sap, but also it  cannot be kindled with fire nor ignite of itself, unless like stone in a  limekiln it is burned with other wood. And even then it does not take  fire nor produce burning coals, but after a long time it slowly consumes  away. This is because there is a very small proportion of the elements  of fire and air in its composition, which is a dense and solid mass of  moisture and the earthy, so that it has no open pores through which fire  can find its way; but it repels the force of fire and does not let  itself be harmed by it quickly. Further, its weight will not let it  float in water, so that when transported it is loaded on shipboard or on  rafts made of fir.    15. It is worth while to know how this wood was discovered. The divine  Caesar, being with his army in the neighbourhood of the Alps, and having  ordered the towns to furnish supplies, the inhabitants of a fortified  stronghold there, called Larignum, trusting in the natural strength of  their defences, refused to obey his command. So the general ordered his  forces to the assault. In front of the gate of this stronghold there  was a tower, made of beams of this wood laid in alternating directions  at right angles to each other, like a funeral pyre, and built high, so  that they could drive off an attacking party by throwing stakes and  stones from the top. When it was observed that they had no other  missiles than stakes, and that these could not be hurled very far from  the wall on account of the weight, orders were given to approach and to  throw bundles of brushwood and lighted torches at this outwork. These  the soldiers soon got together.    16. The flames soon kindled the brushwood which lay about that wooden  structure and, rising towards heaven, made everybody think that the  whole pile had fallen. But when the fire had burned itself out and  subsided, and the tower appeared to view entirely uninjured, Caesar in  amazement gave orders that they should be surrounded with a palisade,  built beyond the range of missiles. So the townspeople were frightened  into surrendering, and were then asked where that wood came from which  was not harmed by fire. They pointed to trees of the kind under  discussion, of which there are very great numbers in that vicinity. And  so, as that stronghold was called Larignum, the wood was called larch.  It is transported by way of the Po to Ravenna, and is to be had in Fano,  Pesaro, Ancona, and the other towns in that neighbourhood. If there were  only a ready method of carrying this material to Rome, it would be of  the greatest use in buildings; if not for general purposes, yet at least  if the boards used in the eaves running round blocks of houses were made  of it, the buildings would be free from the danger of fire spreading  across to them, because such boards can neither take fire from flames or  from burning coals, nor ignite spontaneously.    17. The leaves of these trees are like those of the pine; timber from  them comes in long lengths, is as easily wrought in joiner's work as is  the clearwood of fir, and contains a liquid resin, of the colour of  Attic honey, which is good for consumptives.    With regard to the different kinds of timber, I have now explained of  what natural properties they appear to be composed, and how they were  produced. It remains to consider the question why the highland fir, as  it is called in Rome, is inferior, while the lowland fir is extremely  useful in buildings so far as durability is concerned; and further to  explain how it is that their bad or good qualities seem to be due to the  peculiarities of their neighbourhood, so that this subject may be  clearer to those who examine it.          CHAPTER X    HIGHLAND AND LOWLAND FIR      1. The first spurs of the Apennines arise from the Tuscan sea between  the Alps and the most distant borders of Tuscany. The mountain range  itself bends round and, almost touching the shores of the Adriatic in  the middle of the curve, completes its circuit by extending to the  strait on the other shore. Hence, this side of the curve, sloping  towards the districts of Tuscany and Campania, lies basking in the sun,  being constantly exposed to the full force of its rays all day. But the  further side, sloping towards the Upper Sea and having a northern  exposure, is constantly shrouded in shadowy darkness. Hence the trees  which grow on that side, being nourished by the moisture, not only  themselves attain to a very large size, but their fibre too, filled full  of moisture, is swollen and distended with abundance of liquid. When  they lose their vitality after being felled and hewn, the fibre retains  its stiffness, and the trees as they dry become hollow and frail on  account of their porosity, and hence cannot last when used in buildings.    2. But trees which grow in places facing the course of the sun are not  of porous fibre but are solid, being drained by the dryness; for the sun  absorbs moisture and draws it out of trees as well as out of the earth.  The trees in sunny neighbourhoods, therefore, being solidified by the  compact texture of their fibre, and not being porous from moisture, are  very useful, so far as durability goes, when they are hewn into timber.  Hence the lowland firs, being conveyed from sunny places, are better  than those highland firs, which are brought here from shady places.    3. To the best of my mature consideration, I have now treated the  materials which are necessary in the construction of buildings, the  proportionate amount of the elements which are seen to be contained in  their natural composition, and the points of excellence and defects of  each kind, so that they may be not unknown to those who are engaged in  building. Thus those who can follow the directions contained in this  treatise will be better informed in advance, and able to select, among  the different kinds, those which will be of use in their works.  Therefore, since the preliminaries have been explained, the buildings  themselves will be treated in the remaining books; and first, as due  order requires, I shall in the next book write of the temples of the  immortal gods and their symmetrical proportions.          BOOK III          INTRODUCTION      1. Apollo at Delphi, through the oracular utterance of his priestess,  pronounced Socrates the wisest of men. Of him it is related that he said  with sagacity and great learning that the human breast should have been  furnished with open windows, so that men might not keep their feelings  concealed, but have them open to the view. Oh that nature, following his  idea, had constructed them thus unfolded and obvious to the view! For if  it had been so, not merely the virtues and vices of the mind would be  easily visible, but also its knowledge of branches of study, displayed  to the contemplation of the eyes, would not need testing by  untrustworthy powers of judgement, but a singular and lasting influence  would thus be lent to the learned and wise. However, since they are not  so constructed, but are as nature willed them to be, it is impossible  for men, while natural abilities are concealed in the breast, to form a  judgement on the quality of the"]]]
