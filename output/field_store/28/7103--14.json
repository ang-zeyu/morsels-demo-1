I had only read  St. Francis de Sales, Thomas a'Kempis, _The Spiritual Combat_, and  the Holy Scriptures. I was quite a stranger to those spiritual books  wherein such states are described.    Then all those amusements and pleasures that are prized and esteemed  appeared to me dull and insipid. I wondered how it could be that I had  ever enjoyed them. And indeed since that time, I could never find any  satisfaction or enjoyment out of God. I have sometimes been unfaithful  enough to find it. I was not astonished that martyrs gave their lives  for Jesus Christ. I thought them happy, and sighed after their  privilege of suffering for Him, I so esteemed the cross that my  greatest trouble was the want of suffering as much as my heart thirsted  for.    This respect and esteem for the cross continually increased. Afterward  I lost the sensible relish and enjoyment, yet the love and esteem no  more left me than the cross itself. Indeed, it has ever been my  faithful companion, changing and augmenting, in proportion to the  changes and dispositions of my inward state. O blessed cross, thou hast  never quitted me, since I surrendered myself to my divine, crucified  Master. I still hope that thou wilt never abandon me. So eager was I  for the cross, that I endeavored to make myself feel the utmost rigor  of every mortification. This only served to awaken my desire for  suffering, and to show me that it is God alone that can prepare and  send crosses suitable to a soul that thirsts for a following of His  sufferings, and a conformity to His death. The more my state of prayer  augmented, my desire of suffering grew stronger, as the full weight of  heavy crosses from every side came thundering upon me.    The peculiar property of this prayer of the heart is to give a strong  faith. Mine was without limits, as was also my resignation to God, and  my confidence in Him--my love of His will, and of the order of His  providence over me. I was very timorous before, but now feared nothing.  It is in such a case that one feels the efficacy of these words, \"My  yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matt. 11:30).          CHAPTER 13      I had a secret desire given me from that time to be wholly devoted to  the disposal of my God, let that be what it would. I said, \"What  couldst Thou demand of me, that I would not willingly offer Thee? Oh,  spare me not.\" The cross and humiliations were represented to my mind  in the most frightful colors, but this deterred me not. I yielded  myself up as willing and indeed our Lord seemed to accept of my  sacrifice, for His divine providence furnished me incessantly with  occasions and opportunities for putting it to the test.    I had difficulty to say vocal prayers I had been used to repeat. As  soon as I opened my lips to pronounce them, the love of God seized me  strongly. I was swallowed up in a profound silence and an inexpressible  peace. I made fresh attempts but still in vain. I began again and  again, but could not go on. I had never before heard of such a state, I  knew not what to do. My inability increased because my love to the Lord  was growing more strong, more violent and more overpowering. There was  made in me, without the sound of words, a continual prayer. It seemed  to me to be the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself; a prayer of  the Word, which is made by the Spirit. According to St. Paul it \"asketh  for us that which is good, perfect, and conformable to the will of God\"  (Rom. 8:26-27).    My domestic crosses continued. I was prevented from seeing or even  writing to Mrs. Granger. My very going to divine service or the  sacrament, were a source of woeful offences. The only amusement I had  left me, was the visiting and attending the sick poor, and performing  the lowest offices for them.    My prayer-time began to be exceedingly distressing. I compelled myself  to continue at it, though deprived of all comfort and consolation. When  I was not employed therein, I felt an ardent desire and longing for it.  I suffered inexpressible anguish in my mind, and endeavored with the  severest inflictions of corporeal austerities to mitigate and divert  it--but in vain. I found no more that enlivening vigor which had  hitherto carried me on with great swiftness. I seemed to myself to be  like those young brides, who find a great deal of difficulty to lay  aside their self-love, and to follow their husbands to the war. I  relapsed into a vain complacency and fondness for myself. My propensity  to pride and vanity, which seemed quite dead, while I was so filled  with love of God, now showed itself again, and gave me severe exercise.  This made me lament the exterior beauty of my person, and pray to God  incessantly, that he would remove from me that obstacle, and make me  ugly. I could even have wished to be deaf, blind and dumb, that nothing  might divert me from my love of God.    I set out on a journey, which we had then to make, and I appeared more  than ever like those lamps which emit a glimmering flash, when they are  just on the point of extinguishing. Alas! how many snares were laid in  my way! I met them at every step. I even committed infidelities through  unwatchfulness.    O my Lord, with what rigor didst Thou punish them! A useless glance was  checked as a sin. How many tears did those inadvertent faults cost me,  through a weak compliance, and even against my will! Thou knowest that  Thy rigor, exercised after my slips, was not the motive of those tears  which I shed. With what pleasure would I have suffered the most  rigorous severity to have been cured of my infidelity. To what severe  chastisement did I not condemn myself! Sometimes Thou didst treat me  like a father who pities the child, and caresses it after its  involuntary faults. How often didst Thou make me sensible of Thy love  toward me, notwithstanding my blemishes! It was the sweetness of this  love after my falls which caused my greatest pain; for the more the  amiableness of Thy love was extended to me, the more inconsolable I was  for having departed ever so little from Thee. When I had let some  inadvertence escape me, I found Thee ready to receive me. I have often  cried out, \"O my Lord! is it possible thou canst be so gracious to such  an offender, and so indulgent to my faults; so propitious to one who  has wandered astray from Thee, by vain complaisances, and an unworthy  fondness for frivolous objects? Yet no sooner do I return, than I find  Thee waiting, with open arms ready to receive me.\"    O sinner, sinner! hast thou any reason to complain of God? If there yet  remains in thee any justice, confess the truth, and admit that it is  owing to thyself if thou goest wrong; that in departing from Him thou  disobeyest His call. When thou returnest, He is ready to receive thee;  and if thou returnest not, He makes use of the most engaging motives to  win thee. Yet thou turnest a deaf ear to His voice; thou wilt not hear  Him. Thou sayest He speaks not to thee, though He calls loudly. It is  therefore only because thou daily rebellest, and art growing daily more  and more deaf to the voice.    When I was in Paris, and the clergy saw me so young, they appeared  astonished. Those to whom I opened my state told me, that I could never  enough thank God for the graces conferred on me; that if I knew them I  should be amazed at them; and that if I were not faithful, I should be  the most ungrateful of all creatures. Some declared that they never  knew any woman whom God held so closely, and in so great a purity of  conscience.    I believe what rendered it so was the continual care Thou hadst over  me, O my God, making me feel Thy presence, even as Thou hast promised  it to us in Thy Gospel,--\"if a man love me, my Father will love him,  and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him\" (John 14:23).  The continual experience of Thy presence in me was what preserved me. I  became deeply assured of what the prophet had said, \"Except the Lord  keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain\" (Ps. 127:1). Thou, O my  Love, wert my faithful keeper, who didst defend my heart against all  sorts of enemies, preventing the least faults, or correcting them when  vivacity had occasioned their being committed. But alas! when Thou  didst cease to watch for me, or left me to myself, how weak was I, and  how easily did my enemies prevail over me! Let others ascribe their  victory to their own fidelity. As for me, I shall never attribute them  to anything else than thy paternal care. I have too often experienced,  to my cost, what I should be without Thee, to presume in the least on  any cares of my own. It is to Thee, and to Thee only, that I owe  everything. O my Deliverer; and my being indebted to Thee for it gives  me infinite joy.    While in Paris, I relaxed and did many things which I should not. I  knew the extreme fondness which some had for me, and suffered them to  express it without checking it as I ought. I fell into other faults  too, as having my neck a little too bare, though not near so much as  others had. I plainly saw I was too remiss; and that was my torment. I  sought all about for Him who had secretly inflamed my heart. But, alas!  hardly anybody knew Him. I cried, \"Oh, Thou best beloved of my soul,  hadst Thou been near me these disasters had not befallen me.\" When I  say that I spoke thus to Him, it is but to explain myself. In reality,  it all passed almost in silence, for I could not speak. My heart had a  language which was carried on without the sound of words, understood of  Him, as He understands the language of the Word, which speaks  incessantly in the innermost recesses of the soul. Oh, sacred language!  Experience only gives the comprehension of it! Let not any think it a  barren language, and effect of the mere imagination. Far different--it  is the silent expression of the Word in the soul.

It seemed rather  hopeless, but with infinite patience he sought to make clear to her that  any human being whose life is not to be useless and profitless must  have some object to attain, some work to do which will develop his  character. When she replied that he had character enough, and her only  object in life was to be his wife, what more was there to say? Flattery  at once so charming and so complete left him defenseless, and he kissed  her and went away, trying not to ask himself whether a legal ceremony  could ever make wedded souls of two mortals of such diverse views of  life. And yet, she was so sweet, so sweet!    In spite of the many other demands upon his time, Dr. Earl saw his first  patient very frequently. Mrs. Bell did not appear cramped for means, and  provided everything that could add to her little daughter's comfort,  including not a few luxuries, which Dr. Earl felt convinced were the  gift of Miss Holland. If he had vaguely hoped that he might meet her at  his patient's he was destined to disappointment. Once her car arrived  just as he was leaving, and another time they passed on the stairs. He  told himself that it was better so, and yet when he took her hand, and  felt the firm, strong fingers, well-knit and efficient, for no soft,  yielding little five-and-a-half glove-wearer ever compassed Beethoven,  he knew that hers was a nature that could answer to his own, and his  hand tightened involuntarily. There was something in his look as he met  the blue eyes on the step above that brought the warm blood to her face,  and she swayed toward him almost imperceptibly, and then with a word of  courteous greeting went on her way, for she knew that according to  common report he was to marry Miss Kimball that fall. Her lip curled a  little, for she remembered Leonora of old; she knew her pink-and-white  prettiness and the few and simple enfoldments of her elementary little  brain, just large enough to hold a few attractive near-ideas, a thorough  comprehension of all the social conventionalities, and a fixed and  stubborn conviction as to what was or was not \"smart.\" \"If she has a  soul,\" Silvia said to herself with rather unusual heat, \"no one could  tell whether it is in a condition of arrested development, hopeless  atrophy or complete ossification. As well seek diamonds in a common  sandbank as inspiration or aspiration in its sawdusty recesses.\" Then  she laughed, and said, \"Cat!\" softly, which was really most irrelevant.    The day that the cast was to be removed, Silvia appeared laden with good  things that they might celebrate the occasion with due ceremony.    With infinite care and gentleness, Dr. Earl cut down through the cast,  and took it off. The fracture was perfectly knit, but there was a slight  swelling about the knee, and as Earl examined it Silvia saw him compress  his lips in a hard, straight line. Without looking up, or changing his  tone, he asked the child if she had had a fall since the cast had been  changed. She answered readily that about a week before her crutch had  slipped as she was coming indoors, and she had fallen, striking the  injured leg against the stone step, and she winced as he touched the  thin knee.    \"It's too bad,\" he said, \"but there will have to be another cast about  this knee, and you must be more careful, little girl.\"    The tears came to her eyes, and her mother turned to him with an  expression of anxiety. His cheerful face reassured her. \"We'll hope it  won't be for long,\" he said, \"but there's no use taking chances. Has her  health generally been good?\" he asked Mrs. Bell.    \"The diseases common to childhood went rather hard with her and she had  considerable trouble with her neck and throat a few years ago,\" Mrs.  Bell replied.    He made an examination of the glands of her neck, but said no more.    In spite of many insistent calls elsewhere, Dr. Earl remained long  enough to help lend an air of festivity to the small party, which Silvia  presided over with infinite tact, and with a last admonition to Mrs.  Bell to keep the little girl in bed until he came again, and as quiet as  possible, he took his departure, and Silvia went with him.    \"Tell me what is the matter?\" she said, with her usual directness, when  they were out on the street.    \"What makes you think anything is?\" he parried.    \"I beg your pardon,\" she said, a trifle coldly. \"I should not have  asked.\"    He turned to her and stopped, mute reproach in his eyes. \"There isn't a  shadow of doubt that tuberculosis has developed in that knee, and while  I hope to arrest it, and perfect a cure in time, I am very anxious,  nevertheless.\"    \"But the break has united?\" she asked.    \"Oh, yes, and that goes to show that this condition is very recent, and  mild, but with her antecedent history no one can tell what may happen,\"  he said.    \"Antecedent history?\" Silvia said, rather puzzled. \"I thought you did  not know the family?\"    \"I didn't,\" he answered, \"but you may remember that I looked very  carefully at the bruises about the knee when I set the leg, and I asked  Mrs. Bell some general questions but received no very definite replies  until to-day, and what you heard indicates that the child has already  had a slight attack of tuberculosis. I had counted on my treatment to  overcome the weakening influences of confinement to bed and crutch for  so long a time.\"    Silvia was silent, as if thinking out some plan, and said suddenly,  \"Then it will all resolve itself into a contest between health and  disease, with a considerable handicap against the patient?\"    \"Yes,\" he said. \"With plenty of good food and good air and the right  kind of care, there is no reason why she should not win. And I intend  that she shall,\" he concluded energetically.          CHAPTER XIII    AN ANTI-SUFFRAGE MEETING      Dr. Earl redoubled his attentions to Leonora, determined to give her no  just cause for complaint. The doubts that had beset him disappeared, for  no one could be more charming than Leonora, when she was permitted to  follow her own bent. Her mother also showed her gratification at his  devotion, and tried, with consummate tact, to wean him away from his  evident partiality for the suffrage cause. She gave him the best of the  tracts issued by the Anti-Suffrage Society; while he was waiting for his  offices to be fitted up, she took him to lectures and teas and  receptions where anti-suffrage sentiment abounded, and tried in various  ways to convince him of the superior social status of the \"Anti\" women.    The culmination was reached, however, when he escorted her and Leonora  to a meeting in a large theatre one afternoon. They were prominent  figures in one of the boxes nearest the stage, and Silvia Holland and  Carroll Renner, who were sitting well toward the rear of the parquet,  had ample opportunity to watch the effect of the meeting upon him.    Frank Earl, who had come in directly afterward and taken a seat just  back of them, leaned forward and talked while the crowd gathered. \"Oh,  don't mind him,\" he said, when Miss Renner asked if that were not his  brother with the anti-suffrage leaders. \"He can't help himself, but if  he doesn't go away from here ready to enlist under Miss Holland's banner  I miss my count. Even I should, were it not that I have seen the folly  of it all on its native heath. Don't make faces at me, Carroll, or  people will know you are a suffragette.\"    The theatre had been profusely decorated with flags, flowers and  bunting, and mottoes were festooned along the walls, one of which was  \"God Bless Our Homes,\" and another, \"Imbecile Children Will Be the  Product of Imbecile Voting Women.\"    Dr. Earl was much impressed with the audience, which, nevertheless,  seemed rather chilly and unresponsive. A dignity prevailed which either  could not or dared not give way to any decided demonstration, in marked  contradistinction to the enthusiasm which characterized the suffrage  meetings he had witnessed.    In addition to the bunting and the mottoes, there were a number of large  pictures, done in the style of the cartoonist. One of these showed a  colonial dame at her spinning-wheel, with the words \"An American Lady of  Four Generations Ago\" beneath it; beside it was the picture of a  masculine-looking woman, in a harem skirt, standing on a box at a street  corner, addressing other women similarly attired; this was called \"The  American Suffragette.\" Another picture showed a nurse caring for the  sick and dying soldiers on one side, and on the other a suffragette  charging the police; this picture was labeled \"Before and After Taking.\"    The meeting opened with a spirited address by the president of the  association, Mrs. Briglow-Jorliss, who was welcomed with a brief rustle  of well-bred applause, led by Frank Earl.    \"Got to do it,\" he said, in answer to Carroll's reproachful look.  \"You'll see; even Jack will catch on before the end of the meeting.  Always applaud these folks when they begin; maybe you can't when they  quit.\"    Mrs. Briglow-Jorliss told of the enormous gains recently made by the  \"Antis\" among the select people of the city, and passed off the suffrage  parade as merely a tatterdemalion host of the riff-raff of the city led  by a few notoriety seekers.    \"You see, Miss Holland,\" Frank whispered, \"what a good thing it is that  I came here; I never should have known that that parade wasn't one of  the finest assemblages of women in the world if I hadn't.\"    Silvia laughed in spite of herself, and the stout lady on the platform  went on piling up the indictment against her sex, and showing how  demoralizing the vote had proved to women; how the suffrage"]]]
