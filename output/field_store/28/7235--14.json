The sarcophagus had  passed through the hands of several collectors since Mazois figured it,  and I had a long and amusing search for it.    [98] _Mittheilungen des K. D.

This he has done with singular taste and skill. My figure has been reduced  from this copy. The press has also been figured in outline by Garrucci,  _Arte Christiana_, Vol. III., Pl. 126.

The words of this letter, which I have translated very freely, are  as follows:    Sed dum haec tacitus mecum revolvo, occurrit mihi quod in Bibliotheca  studiosi saecularium litterarum puer quondam, ut se aetatis illius  curiositas habet, praetereundo legissem. Nam cum supra memoratae aedis  ordinator ac dominus, inter expressas lapillis aut ceris discoloribus,  formatasque effigies vel Oratorum vel etiam Poetarum specialia singulorum  autotypis epigrammata subdidisset; ubi ad praeiudicati eloquii venit  poetam, hoc modo orsus est.    The last three lines of the inscription are from the _AEneid_, Book I. 607.  I owe the most important part of the translation of Rusticus to Lanciani,  _ut supra_, p. 196: that of Virgil is by Professor Conington.

[114] Signor Lanciani (_Ancient Rome_, p. 195) was the first to suggest a  comparison between the Vatican Library and those of ancient Rome.          APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I.    DECORATION OF THE VATICAN LIBRARY.      The system of decoration carried out in this Library, of which I have just  given a summary description, is so interesting, and bears evidence of so  much care and thought, that I subjoin a detailed account of it, which, by  the kindness of Father Ehrle, prefect of the Library, I was enabled to  draw up during my late visits to Rome. The diagrammatic ground-plan (fig.  18) which accompanies this description, if studied in conjunction with the  general view (fig. 16), will make the relation of the subjects to each  other perfectly clear. The visitor is supposed to enter the Library from  the vestibule at the east end; and the notation of the piers, windows,  wall-frescoes, etc., begins from the same end. Further, the visitor is  supposed to examine the east face of each pier first, and then to turn to  the left.    I will begin with the figures on the central piers and half-piers. These  figures are painted in fresco, of heroic size: and over their heads are  the letters which they are supposed to have invented.    1. PILASTER AGAINST EAST WALL.      ADAM.      A tall stalwart figure dressed in short chiton. He holds an apple in his    left hand, and a mattock in his right.      Adam divinitus edoctus primus scientiarum et litterarum inventor.    2. FIRST PIER.      (_a_) ABRAHAM.      Abraham Syras et Chaldaicas litteras invenit.      (_b_) THE SONS OF SETH.      Filii Seth columnis duabus rerum coelestium disciplinam inscribunt.      (_c_) ESDRAS.      Esdras novas Hebraeorum litteras invenit.      (_d_) MOSES.      Moyses antiquas Hebraicas litteras invenit.    On the cornice of the presses round this pier are the following  inscriptions:      (_a_) Doctrina bona dabit gratiam. Prov. xiii. 15.    (_b_) Volo vos sapientes esse in bono. Rom. xvi. 19.    (_c_) Impius ignorat scientiam. Prov. xxix. 7.    (_d_) Cor sapientis quaerit doctrinam. Prov. xv. 14.    3. SECOND PIER.      (_a_) MERCURY.      Mercurius Thovt AEgyptiis sacras litteras conscripsit.      (_b_) ISIS.      Isis regina AEgyptiarum litterarum inventrix.      (_c_) MENON.      Menon Phoroneo aequalis litteras in AEgypto invenit.      (_d_) HERCULES.      Hercules aegyptius Phrygias litteras invenit.      On the cornice of the presses:      (_a_) Recedere a malo intelligentia. Job xxviii. 28.    (_b_) Timere Deum ipsa est sapientia. Job xxviii. 22.    (_c_) Faciendi plures libros nullus est finis. Eccl. xii. 12.    (_d_) Dat scientiam intelligentibus disciplinam. Dan. xi. 12.    4."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#14)"],[1,"tion.--A tree, 30-40° high, with leaves alternate,  compound, odd-pinnate; leaflets opposite, ovate, pointed,  dentate. Flowers in large axillary compound panicles. Calyx,  5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals, rose-colored within, lilac-colored  without. Stamens 10, united into a cylindrical tube, expanded at both  ends, the mouth 15-toothed. Anthers inserted near the apex of the  tube, short, fleshy, bilocular. Ovary free, of 5 biovuled cells. Style  of equal length with the tube. Stigma button-shaped. Fruit a drupe,  about the size of a small olive, yellow when ripe, with a dark brown  pit of 5 one-seeded cells.    Habitat.--Native of China; is cultivated in most gardens in the  Philippines.        _Dysoxylum Blancoi_, Vidal. (_D. salutare_, F. Villar; _Turroca  virens_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Igiw_, _Agiw_, _Taliatan_, Tag.; _Ananangtang_, _Bakugan_,  _Makasili_, Vis.; _Malabangaw_, Pam.; _Basiloag_, Iloc.    Uses.--The bark of the trunk, dry and finely powdered, is used in  doses of 1 1/2-2 1/2 grams as an emetic, and, according to Padre  Blanco, its effect is very certain.    It is also a febrifuge, and Padre Mercado states that it cures \"all  forms of asthma, suffocative affections of the chest, and griping  pains of the belly.\" He also states that it yields marvelous results  in malarial fevers, given during the cold stage in doses of 4-8  grams in water or wine in which it has macerated 12 hours. He also  recommends its use before breakfast as an anthelmintic in lumbricoids,  and finally attributes to it virtues as an emmenagogue.    Padre Blanco calls attention to the species _D. schizochitoides_,  Turcz. (_Turroea octandra_, Blanco), _Himamaw_, Tag., as a substitute  for _D. Blancoi_.    The Tagalo \"herb-doctors\" pretend that the part of the bark near the  earth is doubly efficacious, for which reason they administer only  that portion which is within one meter of the ground, giving it in  the doses already mentioned.    Botanical Description.--Tree 16-20 meters high. Leaves  glabrous, odd-pinnate, petioles very long; leaflets entire,  opposite, short-petiolate, acute, oblique at the base. Flowers in  axillary panicles. Calyx, 5 imbricated sepals. Corolla, 5 linear,  lanceolate petals united at the base. Staminal tube, 10-toothed and  10-anthered. Ovary 5-celled, each cell containing two ovules. Style  somewhat longer than the stamens. Stigma thick and depressed. Seed  vessel globose, depressed, somewhat downy, 5-angled; with 5  compartments each containing 2 seeds.    Habitat.--Batangas and Laguna.        _Sandoricum Indicum_, Cav.    Nom. Vulg.--_Santol_, Tag.    Uses.--The santol is doubtless one of the best known fruits in  Manila. The most savory portion is the center, which consists of seeds  covered with a white pulp of a delicious flavor in the ripe fruit  of good quality. The fleshy covering is edible only in the center  of the fruit and only a very thin layer of that, the rest having  very little flavor. The whole fruit is used in making a confection  often prescribed as an astringent. Padre Mercado compares it very  appropriately to the quince. The root of the santol is aromatic,  stomachic and astringent, by virtue of which latter property it is  used in Java in the treatment of leucorrhoea.    Botanical Description.--A tree, 30-40° high, well known in the  islands. Leaves ternate; leaflets 4-5' long, half-ovate, obtuse,  entire, stiff and downy, the middle one elliptical. Flowers in  panicles. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla much longer than the calyx, 5  greenish petals, linear and curved downwards. Nectary a cylindrical  tube attached to the corolla for half its length, mouth 10-toothed,  containing 10 sessile anthers. Style somewhat longer than the  stamens. Stigma 5-parted. Fruit about size and form of a small apple,  thick, brown, pericarp indehiscent, 5 or more one-seeded compartments.    Habitat.--Grows in all parts of the islands, commonly along the roads.        _Carapa Moluccensis_, Lam. (_Xylocarpus granatum_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Tabigi_, _Nigi_, _Kalumpang sa lati_, Tag.; _Migi_, Pam.    Uses.--The seeds contain a yellow oil, bitter and astringent, with a  characteristic odor, having a taste somewhat resembling the odor. In  decoction they are used for diarrhoea and dysentery, on account,  doubtless, of the tannin they contain. The dose is 1-2 seeds dried,  pounded and infused with 200 grams of sweetened water.    The bark, also bitter, is said to be useful in fevers.    In America they extract an oil from the species of the _C. Guianensis_,  Aubl., with which the negroes anoint themselves to keep away stinging  insects. Wood soaked in this oil is also proof against insects.    Botanical Description.--This tree, 20° high, grows in swampy  districts. Leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate. Two pairs of wedge-shaped  leaflets, entire and glabrous. Petiole very short. Calyx inferior,  4-5-toothed. Corolla, 4-5 concave petals, slightly notched at the  end. Nectary notched, ovate, 8-9-toothed. No filaments. Anthers  equal in number to the teeth of the nectary and inserted between  them. Ovary very thick, globose. Stigma shield-shaped. Drupe globose,  resembling a very large orange, 5 chambers, each containing 1, 2 or  more seeds, convex on one side and concave on the other, angular and  much crowded. Testa hard and porous.    Habitat.--Common throughout the Archipelago.        _Cedrela Toona_, Roxb. (_C. odorata_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kalantas_, Tag., Pam.; _Lanigpa_, Vis.    Uses.--The infusion of the flowers is antispasmodic. The trunk bark  is an excellent astringent, and Dr. Waitz recommends it in extract  as a treatment for infantile diarrhoea, for which I also have found  it very useful. Blume says that it contains marked antispasmodic  virtues, and Dr. G. Kennedy confirms it. Other physicians of India,  among them Ros and Newton, have recommended the bark as a substitute  for cinchona, given dry in doses of 30 grams.    Infusion.--              Bark dry, pounded           30 grams.          Water                      150 grams.    Filter and add:            Syrup of cinnamon           20 grams.      Dose.--Several dessert-spoonfuls a day.    The powdered bark is very useful as an application to indolent ulcers  which it instantly deodorizes; like powdered quinine it is used in  the treatment of superficial gangrene.    Botanical Description.--A large tree. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets  oval, lanceolate, acuminate, entire, glabrous, 5-6 pairs. Flowers  yellow, in terminal panicles. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 oblong  petals. Stamens 5, free, inserted on the apex of a disk. Ovaries  sessile, 5 many-ovuled cells. Style short. Stigma on a disk. Seed  vessel coriaceous, 5 compartments, septicidal, 5-valved. Seeds  compressed, pendulous, prolonged in a membranous wing.    Habitat.--Very common in the islands.          CELASTRACEÆ.    Staff-Tree Family.        _Celastrus paniculata_, Willd. (_C. alnifolia_, DC.; _C. Rothiana_,  Roem.; _Diosma serrata_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Bilogo_, Tag.    Uses.--I am not acquainted with the medicinal uses of this plant  in the Philippines. In India, by means of a primitive system of  distillation, they extract from the seeds a dark-colored oil of  empyreumatic odor, which under the name of Oleum nigrum was once  proclaimed by Dr. Herklots as the sovereign remedy for beriberi.    This oil in doses of 10-15 drops a day is a very powerful stimulant,  the action of which is manifested by profuse perspiration several  hours after its administration. Malcolmson reports that it has  given him good results in several cases of beriberi, particularly  in recent cases and those in which nervous and paralytic symptoms  predominated. In Concan, the juice of the leaves is given in doses  of 30 grams as an antidote for opium. The bruised seeds made into a  paste with cow urine are used locally in treatment of itch. They are  also used in the treatment of leprosy, gout, rheumatism, and other  diseases which according to their medical theories, are derived from  \"cold humors.\" For these purposes they give the seeds internally,  beginning with one and increasing daily until 50 are taken. At the  same time they make external applications of the oil or of another  compound prepared in the following way:    Place in an open pot with one opening, seeds of _C. paniculata_,  cloves, benzoin, nutmeg and mace. The pot having been previously  heated, is covered with another, inverted over the opening. On the  sides of the latter a thick black oil condenses which Herklots very  appropriately named _Oleum nigrum_.    Botanical Description.--A climbing shrub, 6-9° high, without  spines. Leaves 6-7' long by 5' broad, alternate, petiolate,  entire, glabrous, half-ovate. Flowers small and paniculate. Calyx, 5  divisions. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, inserted in a disc. Anthers  oblong. Ovary 3-celled. Stigma 3-lobulate. Style short. Seed vessel  the size of a pea, globose, 3-celled, loculicidal, with pulpy seeds.    Habitat.--Tayabas, Laguna, Ilocos North, San Mateo, Albay. Flowers  in April.          RHAMNACEÆ.    Buckthorn Family.        _Zizyphus Jujuba, Lam._ (_Rhamnus Jujuba_, L. & Blanco;  _Z. Mauritania_, Wall.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Manzanitas_, Sp.-Fil.; _Jujube Fruit_, Eng.    Uses.--The small fruit known commonly as _manzanitas_ has an agreeable  taste, although ordinarily offered for sale before they are quite  ripe. They are among the most popular dainties at the fairs and  festivals in the provinces of Manila and are the only part of the plant  used in medicine. They possess emollient qualities and are official  in the codex. They enter in the composition of the so-called pectoral  remedies (composed of equal parts of figs, dates, Corinthian raisins  and manzanitas).    Botanical Description.--A shrub, with hooked thorns, leaves alternate,  petiolate, coriaceous, entire, 3-nerved, 2 thorny stipules, one  of them crooked. Flowers small, greenish, axillary. Calyx, 5 oval"]]]
