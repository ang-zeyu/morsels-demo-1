It was granted, and his sable majesty formally  made proposals for Caesar to figure as a roast at a grand feast, which he  was about to hold. My uncle indignantly refused; the king increased the  sum offered, till it amounted to something considerable, and then the  Englishman, unable to control himself, left the room and sent the  customary refreshments, with a message, to signify that the palaver was  ended. Although every precaution was taken to save the animal, he was  stolen that same night, and gratified the palates of the African  gourmands.    I now come to what Colonel Smith calls \"The Familiar Dogs,\" where we  find an amount of intellect, which forbids us to say that they do not  reason, and where self-sacrifice, fidelity, courage, and affection, in  many instances raise them far beyond more gifted creatures. It will be  advisable to follow the series of some established work in treating of  them, and I have selected that of Colonel Hamilton Smith, both for its  extent and its ability. He begins with those which are placed nearest to  the Arctic Circle of both hemispheres, and which form a group of large,  wolfish dogs, with tapering noses, pointed ears, and, generally  speaking, long, white and black hair. They are fierce, broad, and often  web-footed; they swim well, hunt together or alone, and when their  owners turn them out to obtain their own living, often fish with great  dexterity. When they quarrel they constantly destroy each other, for  they never will give up while they are alive. Among them are the  Siberian dogs, remarkable for the instinct with which they return to  their masters, after weeks of absence and self-subsistence, to drag  their sleighs. This is the more curious, as they are then always very  ill fed, and ill treated. They utter yells when about to be yoked, but,  once in file, they move silently and rapidly, sometimes, however, trying  to upset their drivers.    The tail of the Esquimaux dogs is bushy, and curls very much over the  back, which is covered with long, waving hair. They are very patient and  faithful, rapid in their paces, skilful and courageous when hunting,  carry burdens, and are very good tempered. They form a close attachment  to their masters; and one which had been kept in confinement in  Edinburgh, being let loose, entered the kitchen door, found his way  through his owner's house, and, leaping on his bed, gave every sign of  affection. At another time, as his master was walking in Princes Street  Gardens, his foot slipped, and he fell, upon which the dog tried to lift  him up by his coat. He was very cunning, and when he ate, strewed his  meat around him, to entice fowls and rats. He then laid himself down,  and pretended to be asleep; no sooner, however, did they come, than he  pounced upon and killed them.    A pair of Esquimaux dogs lived in the Menagerie of the Jardin des  Plantes, where they were great favourites; but it was extremely painful  to see the poor creatures panting with heat, and almost unable to move,  during the hot weather, only feeling happy when cold water was thrown  over them. The fondness of the Esquimaux dogs for oil never ceases, and  they do not like to drink water, unless it tastes of this substance. Two  of them are said to have stood hour after hour before a candle-maker's  workshop, evidently sniffing the fumes of the melted tallow with great  enjoyment. Their scent is particularly delicate, which renders them  invaluable in the chase of the rein-deer. Nor are they, from their  resolution and ferocity, less useful in attacking the bear, the very  name of which beast, pronounced in their hearing, excites their ardour.  Even in the sledge they dash after their prey, out of the track,  dragging their owner into the pursuit.    In order to test the strength of the Esquimaux dogs, several experiments  have been made, among others by Captain Lyon, who found that three of  them could drag him, on a sledge weighing one hundred pounds, at the  rate of a mile in six minutes. With heavy loads they are often induced  to exert themselves by a woman walking before them, with a mitten in  her hand. Having been accustomed to receive food from her, they believe  that in this way she offers them meat. They are particularly obedient  and affectionate to women, because it is from them that they receive the  only kindnesses bestowed upon them, and a word from a female will excite  them to exertion, when the blows and threats of the men only make them  obstinate.    The dog of the Hare Indians, or Mackenzie river, was first described by  Dr. Richardson, and is of a smaller size than the Esquimaux breed, but  with broad feet, which prevent him from sinking into the snow. One of  them, only seven months old, ran beside this gentleman's sledge for nine  hundred miles, frequently carrying one of his master's mittens in his  mouth; all are very gentle, and, like the Esquimaux dogs, do not bark.    The large, powerful, and handsome dogs which go by the name of  Newfoundland, are not the pure breed of that country. The latter are  more slender in their make, have a sharper muzzle, a wilder look, and  are generally black in colour, with a rusty spot over each eye, and a  tawny muzzle. These are called Labrador dogs, and it is supposed that  they and the Esquimaux have contributed to form the commonly accepted  breed. What the latter have lost, however, in purity of blood, has been  gained on the side of beauty, and there is no animal of its size which  conveys a higher idea of intelligence and dignity, than the so-called  Newfoundland dog. All are semi-palmate, and dive, swim, and keep longer  in the water than any others of their tribe. One was picked up in the  Bay of Biscay, out of sight of any other vessel, fatigued and hungry,  and which, judging from the circumstances, must have been there for many  hours. Their fidelity, their courage, their generosity, are proverbial,  and yet it is whispered that they are occasionally capricious and not to  be trusted. During long years of intercourse with these animals, I never  met with an instance of this; and I have been told that it is more apt  to occur when they have been kept in confinement.    A noble creature of the mixed breed, and of the usual colour--black and  white--belonged to me, and his extreme good-nature, and endeavours to  guard everything belonging to the family, made him like a confidential  servant. The great defects in his disposition were heedlessness, and an  under estimate of his own power; he did not stop to _think_ before he  acted, as many more cautious dogs will do; and he forgot that his weight  was so great as to spoil and crush whatever he laid himself upon. As an  instance of the former, he one day fancied he saw some one whom he knew  in the street, and immediately dashed through the window, smashing not  only the glass, but the framework. Directly he had done it he felt he  had been wrong, and returning through the shattered window, which was  opened for him, he hung his head and walked unbidden to a recess in the  room covered with matting, to which place he was always banished when  naughty, and seated himself. The bell was rung for the house-maid to  come and clear away the broken glass, and as the woman smiled when she  passed Lion, I turned my head towards him. There he sat, with a pair of  my slippers, accidentally left in the room, in his mouth, as if he  thought they would obtain his pardon. My gravity was disturbed, and  Lion, seeing this, humbly came up to me, and rested his chin on my  knees. I then lectured him concerning the mischief he had committed; and  he so perfectly understood, that for a long time, when any one pointed  to the window, he would hang his head and tail, and look ashamed. During  my absence he constantly collected articles which belonged to me, and  slept upon them. One day, on returning from church, he met me on the  stairs, dragging a new silk dress along with him by the sleeve, which he  must have contrived, by himself, to have abstracted from a peg in a  closet.    It must be owned that, clever as my Lion was, Professor Owen was  acquainted with a Lion who surpassed him. This gentleman was walking  with a friend, the master of the dog, by the side of a river, near its  mouth, on the coast of Cornwall, and picked up a small piece of  sea-weed. It was covered with minute animals, and Mr. Owen observed to  his companion, throwing the weed into the water, \"If this small piece  afforded so many treasures, how microscopically rich the whole plant  would be; I should much like to have one!\" The gentleman walked on; but  hearing a splashing in the water, turned round, and saw it violently  agitated. \"It is Lion!\" both exclaimed, \"What can he be about? He was  walking quietly enough by our side a minute ago.\" At one moment they saw  his tail above the water, then his head raised for a breath of air, then  the surrounding element shook again, and at last he came ashore, panting  from his exertions, and laid a whole plant of the identical weed at Mr.  Owen's feet. After this proof of intelligence, it will not be wondered  at, that when Lion was joyfully expecting to accompany his master and  his guest on an excursion, and was told to go and take care of and  comfort Mrs. Owen, who was ill, that he should immediately return to the  drawing-room, and lay himself by her side, which he never left during  the absence of his owner; his countenance alone betraying his  disappointment, and that only for a few minutes.    Many instances are recorded of Newfoundland dogs having saved the lives  of those who have fallen into the water, and among them was my father;  who, when he was one day missing, was traced to a deep pond in his  mother's garden. His friend Trial was called; some of his young  master's clothes were shewn to the dog, the pond was pointed out, and  Trial dashed in, shortly bringing out the body. He watched all the  endeavours"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],[0,"The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#14)"],[1," that Edgar would have done anything wrong, but all sorts of  stories are certain to go about, and I would rather that the truth of  the matter were known. You are the six head fellows of the house, and  when I have told you the story you can do as you like about its going  further.\"    \"Well, if you go up to my study,\" Pinkerton said, \"I will bring the  others up.\"    In three or four minutes the party were gathered there.    \"Look here, Clinton,\" Easton said, \"Pinkerton says he has told you that  we are all sure that, whatever this is all about, your brother has done  nothing he or you need be ashamed about. I should like to say the same  thing, and if it is painful for you to tell it do not say anything about  it. We shall be quite content to know that he has left, if he has  left--although I hope we shall see him again next term for some good  reason or other.\"    \"No, I would rather tell it,\" Rupert said. \"It is a curious story, and a  very unpleasant one for us, but there is nothing at all for us to be  ashamed about.\" And he went on to tell them the whole story, ending with  \"You see, whether Edgar or I am the son of Captain Clinton, or of this  sergeant and his scheming wife, is more than we can say.\"    \"It does not matter a bit to us,\" Easton said, breaking the silence of  surprise with which they had listened to the story. \"We like you and  your brother for yourselves, and it does not matter a rap to us, nor as  far as I can see to anyone else, who your fathers and mothers were.\"    \"I call it horribly hard lines for you both,\" Skinner put in; \"deuced  hard lines, especially for your brother.\"    Pinkerton said: \"By what you say Captain Clinton and his wife don't care  now which is their real son; one is real and the other adopted, and as  they regard you in the same light they don't even want to know which is  which. Well, now you know that, it seems to me you are all right anyhow.  You see your brother didn't know that, and when this woman told him she  was his mother, and that the whole thing had been a preconcerted plot on  her part, I can quite understand his going straight away. I think we  should all have done the same if we had had the same story told to us,  and had seen we were intended to be parties to a fraud of that sort.  Well, I am glad you told us, but I do not think there is any occasion  for the story to go further.\"    \"Certainly not,\" Easton agreed, \"it would do no good whatever; and of  course it would never be kept in the house, but would come to be the  talk of the whole school. All that need be said is that Clinton has told  us the reason of his brother leaving so suddenly, that we are all of  opinion that he acted perfectly rightly in doing so, and that nothing  more is to be said about the matter. We will each give Clinton our word  of honour not to give the slightest hint to anyone about it, or to say  that it is a curious story or anything of that sort, but just to stick  to it that we have heard all about it and are perfectly satisfied.\"    \"That will certainly be the best plan,\" Pinkerton agreed; \"but I think  it would be as well for us to say he has left for family reasons, and  that it is nothing in any way connected with himself, and that we hope  that he will be back again next term.\"    \"Yes, we might say that,\" Easton agreed; \"family reasons mean all sorts  of things, and anyone can take their choice out of them. Well, Clinton,  I shouldn't worry over this more than you can help. I daresay Edgar will  be found in a day or two. At any rate you may be sure that no harm has  come to him, or is likely to come to him. If he emigrates, or anything  of that sort, he is pretty safe to make his way, and I am sure that  whatever he is doing he will always be a gentleman and a good fellow.\"    \"That he will,\" Mossop said cordially. \"I hope we should all have done  as he has under the same circumstances, but it would be a big temptation  to some fellows to have the alternative of a good fortune and a nice  estate on one side, and of going out into the world and making your own  living how you can on the other.\"    There was a chorus of assent.    \"Yes,\" Easton said, \"it is very easy to say 'Do what is right and never  mind what comes of it;' but we should all find it very hard to follow it  in practice if we had a choice like that before us. Well, you tell your  brother when you hear of him, Clinton, that we all think better of him  than before, and that whether he is a sergeant's son or a captain's we  shall welcome him heartily back, and be proud to shake his hand.\"    And so it was settled, and to the great disappointment of the rest of  the house no clue was forthcoming as to the cause of Edgar Clinton  leaving so suddenly; but as the monitors and seniors all seemed  perfectly satisfied with what they had heard, it was evident to the  others that whatever the cause might be he was not to blame in the  matter.    During the short time that remained of the term Rupert got on better  than he had expected. While the examination was going on Easton invited  him to do his work in his private study, gave him his advice as to the  passages likely to be set, and coached him up in difficult points, and  he came out higher in his form than he had expected to do.    Three days before the school broke up Easton said: \"Clinton, I have had  a letter from my father this morning, and he will be very glad if you  will come down to spend the holidays at our place. And so shall I. There  is very good hunting round us. My father has plenty of horses in his  stables, and I expect we shall be rather gay, for my brother comes of  age in the week after Christmas, and there is going to be a ball and so  on. I don't know how you feel about it, but I should say that it would  be better for you than being at home where everything will call your  brother to your mind, and your being there will make it worse for the  others.\"    \"I am very much obliged to you, Easton; I should like it very much. I  will write off to the governor at once and hear what he says. They might  like to have me home, and possibly I might be useful in the search for  Edgar. As I have told you, I feel sure that he has enlisted. He would be  certain to change his name, and it would be no use anyone who did not  know him going to look at the recruits.\"    \"But we agreed, Clinton, that no one would enlist him at his age, and he  is altogether too old to go as a band-boy.\"    \"Yes, I know that; and that is what worries me more than anything. Still  I cannot help thinking that he will try some how to get into the army.  If he can't, I believe he will do anything he can to get a living until  they enlist him.\"    \"I don't think he can anyhow pass as eighteen, Clinton. If it was for  anything else he might get up with false moustache or something; but  you see he has got to pass a strict examination by a surgeon. I have  heard that lots of fellows do enlist under age, but then some fellows  look a good bit older than they are. I don't believe any doctor would be  humbugged into believing that Edgar is anything like eighteen.\"    \"Well, I will write to my father this afternoon and hear what he says.  If he thinks I cannot do any good and they don't want me at home, I  shall be very pleased to come to you.\"    Captain Clinton's letter came by return of post. He said that he was  very pleased Rupert had had an invitation that would keep him away. \"We  have received no news whatever of Edgar, and I don't think that it would  be of any use for you to join in the search for him. There is no saying  where he may have gone or what he may be doing. I agree with you that he  will most likely take any job that offers to keep him until he can  enlist. Arrangements have been made with one of the staff sergeants at  the head-quarters of recruiting in London to let us know if any young  fellow answering to Edgar's description comes up to be medically  examined. So we shall catch him if he presents himself there.  Unfortunately there are such a number of recruiting depots all over the  country, that there is no saying where he may try to enlist--that is, if  he does try. However, at present there is certainly nothing you can do.  I should like to have you home, and your mother says she should like you  too, but I do think that for her sake it is better you should not come.  As long as you are away there is nothing to recall at every moment the  fact that Edgar has gone, whereas if you were here his absence would be  constantly be before her. She is quite ill with anxiety, and Dr.  Wilkinson agrees with me that change is most desirable. I am sure she  would not hear of going away if you were at home; it would give her a  good excuse for staying here; but when she hears that you are not coming  I think I may be able to persuade her to listen to Wilkinson's opinion,  and in that case I shall take her and Madge down to Nice at once. If I  can get her there by Christmas so much the better, for Christmas at home  would be terribly trying to us all. Once we are there, we can wander  about for two or three months in Italy or Spain, or across to Algeria or  Egypt--anything to distract her mind.\"    Accordingly Rupert accepted Easton's invitation, and went with him to  his father's in Leicestershire. Had it not been for the uncertainty  about Edgar he would have enjoyed his holidays greatly. Although he had  always joined to a certain extent in the chaff of his school-fellows at  Easton's care about his dress and little peculiarities of manner, he had  never shared in Skinner's prejudices against him, and always said that  he could do anything well that he chose to turn his hand to, and had  appreciated his readiness to do a kindness to anyone who really needed  it. It had been his turn now, and the friendly companionship of the  elder boy had been of the greatest value to him. Easton had never said  much in the way of sympathy, which indeed would have jarred "]]]
