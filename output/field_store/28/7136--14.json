For this little figure all the glories that we  have passed through have been created: an army of priests attends upon  it day by day, dresses and paints it, spreads food before it, offers  sacrifices and sings hymns in its praise.    Behind the sanctuary lie storehouses, which hold corn and fruits and  wines enough to supply a city in time of siege. The god is a great  proprietor, holding more land than any of the nobles of the country. He  has a revenue almost as great as that of Pharaoh himself. He has troops  of his own, an army which obeys no orders but his. On the Red Sea he has  one fleet, bringing to his temple the spices and incense of the  Southland; and from the Nile mouths another fleet sails to bring home  cedar-wood from Lebanon, and costly stuffs from Tyre. His priests have  far more power than the greatest barons of the land, and Pharaoh, mighty  as he is, would think twice before offending a band of men whose hatred  could shake him on his throne. Such was an Egyptian temple 3,000 years  ago, when Egypt was the greatest power in the world.    But if the temples of ancient Egypt are wonderful, the tombs are almost  more wonderful still. Very early in their history the Egyptians began to  show their sense of the importance of the life after death by raising  huge buildings to hold the bodies of their great men. Even the earliest  Kings, who lived before there was any history at all, had great  underground chambers scooped out and furnished with all sorts of things  for their use in the after-life. But it is when we come to that King  Khufu, who figures in the fairy-stories of Zazamankh and Dedi, that we  begin to understand what a wonderful thing an Egyptian tomb might be.    Not very far from Cairo, the modern capital of Egypt, a line of strange,  pointed buildings rises against the sky on the edge of the desert. These  are the Pyramids, the tombs of the great Kings of Egypt in early days,  and if we want to know what Egyptian builders could do 4,000 years  before Christ, we must look at them. Take the largest of them, the Great  Pyramid, called the Pyramid of Cheops. Cheops is really Khufu, the King  who was so much put out by Dedi's prophecy about Rud-didet's three  babies. No such building was ever reared either before or since. It  stands, even now, 450 feet in height, and before the peak was destroyed,  it was about 30 feet higher. Each of its four sides measures over 750  feet in length, and it covers more than twelve acres of ground, the size  of a pretty large field. But you will get the best idea of how  tremendous a building it is when I tell you that if you used it as a  quarry, you could build a town, big enough to hold all the people of  Aberdeen, out of the Great Pyramid; or if you broke up the stones of  which it is built, and laid them in a line a foot broad and a foot deep,  the line would reach a good deal more than halfway round the world at  the Equator. You would have some trouble in breaking up the stones,  however; for many of the great blocks weigh from 40 to 50 tons apiece,  and they are so beautifully fitted to one another that you could not get  the edge of a sheet of paper into the joints!    Inside this great mountain of stone there are long passages leading to  two small rooms in the centre of the Pyramid; and in one of these rooms,  called \"the King's Chamber,\" the body of the greatest builder the world  has ever seen was laid in its stone coffin. Then the passages were  closed with heavy plug-blocks of stone, so that no one should ever  disturb the sleep of King Khufu. But, in spite of all precautions,  robbers mined their way into the Pyramid ages ago, plundered the coffin,  and scattered to the winds the remains of the King, so that, as Byron  says, \"Not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.\"    The other pyramids are smaller, though, if the Great Pyramid had not  been built, the Second and Third would have been counted world's  wonders. Near the Second Pyramid sits the Great Sphinx. It is a huge  statue, human-headed and lion-bodied, carved out of limestone rock. Who  carved it, or whose face it bears, we do not certainly know; but there  the great figure crouches, as it has crouched for countless ages,  keeping watch and ward over the empty tombs where the Pharaohs of Egypt  once slept, its head towering seventy feet into the air, its vast limbs  and body stretching for two hundred feet along the sand, the strangest  and most wonderful monument ever hewn by the hands of man (Plate 11).    Later on in Egyptian history the Kings and great folk grew tired of  building pyramids, and the fashion changed. Instead of raising huge  structures above ground, they began to hew out caverns in the rocks in  which to lay their dead. Round about Thebes, the rocks on the western  side of the Nile are honeycombed with these strange houses of the  departed. Their walls, in many cases, are decorated with bright and  cheerful pictures, showing scenes of the life which the dead man lived  on earth. There he stands, or sits, placid and happy, with his wife  beside him, while all around him his servants go about their usual work.  They plough and hoe, sow and reap; they gather the grapes from the vines  and put them into the winepress; or they bring the first-fruits of the  earth to present them before their master (Plate 15). In other pictures  you see the great man going out to his amusements, fishing, hunting, or  fowling; or you are taken into the town, and see the tradesmen working,  and the merchants, and townsfolk buying and selling in the bazaars. In  fact, the whole of life in Ancient Egypt passes before your eyes as you  go from chamber to chamber, and it is from these old tomb-pictures that  we have learned the most of what we know of how people lived and worked  in those long-past days.    In one wild rocky glen, called the \"Valley of the Kings,\" nearly all the  later Pharaohs were buried, and to-day their tombs are one of the sights  of Thebes. Let us look at the finest of them--the tomb of Sety I., the  father of that Ramses II. of whom we have heard so much. Entering the  dark doorway in the cliff, you descend through passage after passage and  hall after hall, until at last you reach the fourteenth chamber, \"the  gold house of Osiris,\" 470 feet from the entrance, where the great King  was laid in his magnificent alabaster coffin. The walls and pillars of  each chamber are wonderfully carved and painted. The pillars show  pictures of the King making offerings to the gods, or being welcomed by  them, but the pictures on the walls are very strange and weird. They  represent the voyage of the sun through the realms of the  under-world, and all the dangers and difficulties which the soul of the  dead man has to encounter as he accompanies the sun-bark on its journey.  Serpents, bats, and crocodiles, spitting fire, or armed with spears,  pursue the wicked. The unfortunates who fall into their power are  tortured in all kinds of horrible ways; their hearts are torn out; their  heads are cut off; they are boiled in caldrons, or hung head downwards  over lakes of fire. Gradually the soul passes through all these dangers  into the brighter scenes of the Fields of the Blessed, where the  justified sow and reap and are happy. Finally, the King arrives,  purified, at the end of his long journey, and is welcomed by the gods  into the Abode of the Blessed, where he, too, dwells as a god in  everlasting life.    [Illustration: Plate 15  WALL-PICTURES IN A THEBAN TOMB. _Pages_ 80, 81]    The beautiful alabaster coffin in which the mummy of King Sety was laid  is now in the Soane Museum, London. When it was discovered, nearly a  century ago, it was empty, and it was not till 1872 that some modern  tomb-robbers found the body of the King, along with other royal mummies,  hidden away in a deep pit among the cliffs. Now it lies in the museum at  Cairo, and you can see the face of this great King, its fine, proud  features not so very much changed, we can well believe, from what they  were when he reigned 3,200 years ago. In the same museum you can look  upon the faces of Tahutmes III., the greatest soldier of Egypt; of  Ramses II., the oppressor of the Israelites; and, perhaps most  interesting of all, of Merenptah, the Pharaoh who hardened his heart  when Moses pled with him to let the Hebrews go, and whose picked troops  were drowned in the Red Sea as they pursued their escaping slaves.    It is very strange to think that one can see the actual features and  forms on which the heroes of our Bible story looked in life. The reason  of such a thing is that the Egyptians believed that when a man died, his  soul, which passed to the life beyond, loved to return to its old home  on earth, and find again the body in which it once dwelt; and even,  perhaps, that the soul's existence in the other world depended in some  way on the preservation of the body. So they made the bodies of their  dead friends into what we call \"mummies,\" steeping them for many days in  pitch and spices till they were embalmed, and then wrapping them round  in fold upon fold of fine linen. So they have endured all these hundreds  of years, to be stored at last in a museum, and gazed upon by people who  live in lands which were savage wildernesses when Egypt was a great and  mighty Empire.          CHAPTER XIII    AN EGYPTIAN'S HEAVEN      In this chapter I want to tell you a little about what the Egyptians  thought of heaven--what it was, where it was, how people got there after  death, and what kind of a life they lived when they were there. They had  some very quaint and curious ideas about the heavens themselves. They  believed, for instance, that the blue sky overhead was something like a  great iron plate spread over the world, and supported at the four  corners, north, south, east, and west, by high mountains. The stars were  like little lamps, which hung down from this plate.

For what was  not done or taught by Holy Church must be of 'that wicked  One'--the cunning imitator.    In the twelfth century the Church was alarmed by the simultaneous  springing up of various sects, which, if too hastily claimed by  Protestantism as _Protestants_, in the modern sense, against  Catholic theology, were yet sufficiently hostile or dangerous to  engage the attention and to provoke the enmity of the pontiffs.  The fate of the Stedingers and others in Germany, of the  Paulicians in Northern France; of the Albigenses and Waldenses in  Southern Europe, is in accordance with this successful sort of  theological tactics. Many of the articles of indictment against  those outlaws of the Church and of society are extracted from the  primitive heresies, in particular from the doctrines of the  anti-Judaic and _spiritualising_ Gnostics, and their more than  fifty subdivided sects--Marcionites, Manicheans, &c. Gregory IV.  issued a bull in 1232 against the Stedingers, revolted from the  rule of the Archbishop of Bremen, where they are declared to be  accustomed to scorn the sacraments, hold communion with devils,  make representative images of wax, and consult with witches.[64]      [64] A second bull enters into details. On the reception of    a convert, a toad made its appearance, which was adored by    the assembled crowd. On sitting down to the banquet a black    cat comes upon the stage, double the size of an ordinary    dog, advancing backwards with up-turned tail. The neophytes,    one after another, kissed this feline demon, with due    solemnity, on the back. Walter Mapes has given an account of    the similar ceremonies of the _Publicans_ (Paulicians).    Heretical worship was of a most licentious as well as    disgusting kind. The religious meetings terminate always in    indiscriminate debauchery.    Alchymy, astrology, and kindred arts were closely allied to the  practice of witchcraft: the profession of medicine was little  better than the mixing of magical ointments, love-potions,  elixirs, not always of an innocent sort; and Sangrados were not  wanting in those days to trade upon the ignorance of their  patients.[65] Nor, unfortunately, are the genuine seekers after  truth who honestly applied to the study of nature exempt from the  charge of often an unconscious fraud. Monstrous notions mingled  with the more real results of their meritorious labours. Science  was in its infancy, or rather was still struggling to be freed  from the oppressive weight of speculative and theological  nonsense before emerging into existence. Many of the fancied  phenomena of witch-cases, like other physical or mental  eccentricities, have been explained by the progress of reason and  knowledge. Lycanthropy (the transformation of human beings into  wolves by sorcery), with the no less irrational belief in  demoniacal possession, the product of a diseased imagination and  brain, was one of the many results of mere ignorance of  physiology. In the seventeenth century lycanthropy was gravely  defended by doctors of medicine as well as of divinity, on the  authority of the story of Nebuchadnezzar, which proved undeniably  the possibility of such metamorphoses.      [65] Pliny (_Hist. Natur._ xxx.) 'observes,' as Gibbon    quotes him, 'that magic held mankind by the triple chain of    religion, of physic, and of astronomy.'    Cotemporary annalists record the extraordinary frenzy aggravated,  as it was, by the proceedings against the Templars, the signal of  witch persecutions throughout France. The historian of France  draws a frightful picture of the insecure condition of an  ignorantly prejudiced society. Accusations poured in; poisonings,  adulteries, forgeries, and, above all, charges of witchcraft,  which, indeed, entered as an ingredient into all causes, forming  their attraction and their horror. The judge shuddered on the  judgment seat when the proofs were brought before him in the  shape of philtres, amulets, frogs, black cats, and waxen images  stuck full of needles. Violent curiosity was blended at these  trials with the fierce joy of vengeance and a cast of fear. The  public mind could not be satiated with them: the more there were  burnt, the more there were brought to be burnt.[66] In 1398 the  Sorbonne, at the chancellor's suggestion, published 27 articles  against all sorts of sorcery, pictures of demons, and waxen  figures. Six years later a synod was specially convened at  Langres, and the pressing evil was anxiously deliberated at the  Council of Constance.      [66] Michelet, whose poetic-prose may appear hardly suitable    to the philosophic dignity of history, relating the fate of    two knights accused with a monk of having 'sinned' with the    king's daughter-in-law 'even on the holiest days,' and who    were castrated and flayed alive, truly enough infers that    'the pious confidence of the middle age which did not    mistrust the immuring of a great lady along with her knights    in the precincts of a castle, of a narrow tower; the    vassalage which imposed on young men as a feudal duty the    sweetest cares, was a dangerous trial to human nature.'    Conspicuous about this period, by their importance and iniquity,  are the cases of the Pucelle d'Orleans and the catastrophe of  Arras. Incited (it is a modern conviction) by a noble enthusiasm,  by her own ardent imagination, the Pucelle divested herself of  the natural modesty of her sex for the dress and arms of a  warrior; and 'her inexperienced mind, working day and night on  the favourite object, mistook the impulses of passion for  heavenly inspiration.' Reviewing the last scenes in the life of  that patriotic shepherdess, we hesitate whether to stigmatise  more the unscrupulous policy of the English authorities or the  base subservience of the Parliament of Paris. The English Regent  and the Cardinal of Winchester, unable to allege against their  prisoner (the saviour of her country, taken prisoner in a sally  from a besieged town, had been handed over by her countrymen to  the foreigner) any civil crime, were forced to disguise a  violation of justice and humanity in the pretence of religion;  and the Bishop of Beauvais presented a petition against her, as  an ecclesiastical subject, demanding to have her tried by an  ecclesiastical court for sorcery, impiety, idolatry, and magic.  The University of Paris acquiesced. Before this tribunal the  accused was brought, loaded with chains, and clothed in her  military dress. It was alleged that she had carried about a  standard consecrated by magical enchantments; that she had been  in the habit of attending at the witches' sabbath at a fountain  near the oak of Boulaincourt; that the demons had discovered to  her a magical sword consecrated in the Church of St. Catherine,  to which she owed her victories; that by means of sorcery she had  gained the confidence of Charles VIII. Jeanne d'Arc was convicted  of all these crimes, aggravated by _heresy_: her revelations were  declared to be inventions of the devil to delude the people.[67]      [67] Shakspeare brings the fiends upon the stage: their work    is done, and they now abandon the enchantress. In vain La    Pucelle invokes in her extremity--                  'Ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd          Out of the powerful regions under earth,          Help me this once, that France may get the field.          Oh, hold me not with silence over-long!           'Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,          I'll lop a member off, and give it you,          In earnest of a further benefit;          So you do condescend to help me now.            *       *       *       *       *            Cannot my body, nor blood-sacrifice,          Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?          Then take my soul; my body, soul, and all,          Before that England give the French the foil.          See! they forsake me.            *       *       *       *       *            My ancient incantations are too weak          And hell too strong for me to buckle with.'      But a worthier, if contradictory, origin is assigned for her    enthusiasm when she replies to the foul aspersion of her    taunting captors--           'Virtuous, and holy; chosen from above,          By inspiration of celestial grace,          To work exceeding miracles on earth,          I never had to do with wicked spirits.          But you--that are polluted with your lusts,          Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,          Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices--          Because you want the grace that others have,          You judge it straight a thing impossible          To compass wonders, but by help of devils.'    Her ecclesiastical judges then consigned their prisoner to the  civil power; and, finally, in the words of Hume, 'this admirable  heroine--to whom the more generous superstition of the ancients  would have erected altars--was, on pretence of heresy and magic,  delivered over alive to the flames; and expiated by that dreadful  punishment the signal services she had rendered to her prince and  to her native country.'[68]      [68] _History of England_, XX. Shakspeare (_Henry VI._ part    ii. act i.) has furnished us with the charms and    incantations employed about the same time in the case of the    Duchess of Gloucester. Mother Jourdain is the representative    witch-hag.    Without detracting from the real merit of the patriotic martyr,  it might be suspected that, besides her inflamed imagination, a  pious and pardonable collusion was resorted to as a last  desperate effort to rouse the energy of the troops or the hopes  of the people--a collusion similar to that of the celebrated  Constantinian Cross, or of the Holy Lance of Antioch.
