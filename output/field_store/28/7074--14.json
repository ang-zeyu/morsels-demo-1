The scandal became so widespread that the  conservative Spanish papers demanded the apprehension and punishment  of the gang-leader, Juan Rull, who was subsequently condemned to  death and executed.  The sensational evidence, brought to light  during the trial, forced Police Inspector Momento to exonerate  completely the Anarchists from any connection with the acts committed  during a long period.  This resulted in the dismissal of a number of  police officials, among them Inspector Tressols, who, in revenge,  disclosed the fact that behind the gang of police bomb throwers were  others of far higher position, who provided them with funds and  protected them.    This is one of the many striking examples of how Anarchist  conspiracies are manufactured.    That the American police can perjure themselves with the same ease,  that they are just as merciless, just as brutal and cunning as their  European colleagues, has been proven on more than one occasion.  We  need only recall the tragedy of the eleventh of November, 1887, known  as the Haymarket Riot.    No one who is at all familiar with the case can possibly doubt that  the Anarchists, judicially murdered in Chicago, died as victims of a  lying, bloodthirsty press and of a cruel police conspiracy.  Has not  Judge Gary himself said: \"Not because you have caused the Haymarket  bomb, but because you are Anarchists, you are on trial.\"    The impartial and thorough analysis by Governor Altgeld of that  blotch on the American escutcheon verified the brutal frankness of  Judge Gary.  It was this that induced Altgeld to pardon the three  Anarchists, thereby earning the lasting esteem of every liberty  loving man and woman in the world.    When we approach the tragedy of September sixth, 1901, we are  confronted by one of the most striking examples of how little social  theories are responsible for an act of political violence.  \"Leon  Czolgosz, an Anarchist, incited to commit the act by Emma Goldman.\"  To be sure, has she not incited violence even before her birth, and  will she not continue to do so beyond death?  Everything is possible  with the Anarchists.    Today, even, nine years after the tragedy, after it was proven a  hundred times that Emma Goldman had nothing to do with the event,  that no evidence whatsoever exists to indicate that Czolgosz ever  called himself an Anarchist, we are confronted with the same lie,  fabricated by the police and perpetuated by the press.  No living  soul ever heard Czolgosz make that statement, nor is there a single  written word to prove that the boy ever breathed the accusation.  Nothing but ignorance and insane hysteria, which have never yet been  able to solve the simplest problem of cause and effect.    The President of a free Republic killed!  What else can be the cause,  except that the ATTENTATER must have been insane, or that he was  incited to the act.    A free Republic!  How a myth will maintain itself, how it will  continue to deceive, to dupe, and blind even the comparatively  intelligent to its monstrous absurdities.  A free Republic!  And yet  within a little over thirty years a small band of parasites have  successfully robbed the American people, and trampled upon the  fundamental principles, laid down by the fathers of this country,  guaranteeing to every man, woman, and child \"life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.\"  For thirty years they have been increasing  their wealth and power at the expense of the vast mass of workers,  thereby enlarging the army of the unemployed, the hungry, homeless,  and friendless portion of humanity, who are tramping the country from  east to west, from north to south, in a vain search for work.  For  many years the home has been left to the care of the little ones,  while the parents are exhausting their life and strength for a mere  pittance.  For thirty years the sturdy sons of America have been  sacrificed on the battlefield of industrial war, and the daughters  outraged in corrupt factory surroundings.  For long and weary years  this process of undermining the nation's health, vigor, and pride,  without much protest from the disinherited and oppressed, has been  going on.  Maddened by success and victory, the money powers of this  \"free land of ours\" became more and more audacious in their  heartless, cruel efforts to compete with the rotten and decayed  European tyrannies for supremacy of power.    In vain did a lying press repudiate Leon Czolgosz as a foreigner.  The boy was a product of our own free American soil, that lulled him  to sleep with,         My country, 'tis of thee,       Sweet land of liberty.    Who can tell how many times this American child had gloried in the  celebration of the Fourth of July, or of Decoration Day, when he  faithfully honored the Nation's dead?  Who knows but that he, too,  was willing to \"fight for his country and die for her liberty,\" until  it dawned upon him that those he belonged to have no country, because  they have been robbed of all that they have produced; until he  realized that the liberty and independence of his youthful dreams  were but a farce.  Poor Leon Czolgosz, your crime consisted of too  sensitive a social consciousness.  Unlike your idealless and  brainless American brothers, your ideals soared above the belly and  the bank account.  No wonder you impressed the one human being among  all the infuriated mob at your trial--a newspaper woman--as a  visionary, totally oblivious to your surroundings.  Your large,  dreamy eyes must have beheld a new and glorious dawn.    Now, to a recent instance of police-manufactured Anarchist plots.  In that bloodstained city, Chicago, the life of Chief of Police  Shippy was attempted by a young man named Averbuch.  Immediately the  cry was sent to the four corners of the world that Averbuch was an  Anarchist, and that Anarchists were responsible for the act.  Everyone who was at all known to entertain Anarchist ideas was  closely watched, a number of people arrested, the library of an  Anarchist group confiscated, and all meetings made impossible.  It  goes without saying that, as on various previous occasions, I must  needs be held responsible for the act.  Evidently the American police  credit me with occult powers.  I did not know Averbuch; in fact, had  never before heard his name, and the only way I could have possibly  \"conspired\" with him was in my astral body.  But, then, the police  are not concerned with logic or justice.  What they seek is a target,  to mask their absolute ignorance of the cause, of the psychology of a  political act.  Was Averbuch an Anarchist?  There is no positive  proof of it.  He had been but three months in the country, did not  know the language, and, as far as I could ascertain, was quite  unknown to the Anarchists of Chicago.    What led to his act?  Averbuch, like most young Russian immigrants,  undoubtedly believed in the mythical liberty of America.  He received  his first baptism by the policeman's club during the brutal  dispersement of the unemployed parade.  He further experienced  American equality and opportunity in the vain efforts to find an  economic master.  In short, a three months' sojourn in the glorious  land brought him face to face with the fact that the disinherited are  in the same position the world over.  In his native land he probably  learned that necessity knows no law--there was no difference between  a Russian and an American policeman.    The question to the intelligent social student is not whether the  acts of Czolgosz or Averbuch were practical, any more than whether  the thunderstorm is practical.  The thing that will inevitably  impress itself on the thinking and feeling man and woman is that the  sight of brutal clubbing of innocent victims in a so-called free  Republic, and the degrading, soul-destroying economic struggle,  furnish the spark that kindles the dynamic force in the overwrought,  outraged souls of men like Czolgosz or Averbuch.  No amount of  persecution, of hounding, of repression, can stay this social  phenomenon.    But, it is often asked, have not acknowledged Anarchists committed  acts of violence?  Certainly they have, always however ready to  shoulder the responsibility.  My contention is that they were  impelled, not by the teachings of Anarchism, but by the tremendous  pressure of conditions, making life unbearable to their sensitive  natures.  Obviously, Anarchism, or any other social theory, making  man a conscious social unit, will act as a leaven for rebellion.  This is not a mere assertion, but a fact verified by all experience.  A close examination of the circumstances bearing upon this question  will further clarify my position.    Let us consider some of the most important Anarchist acts within the  last two decades.  Strange as it may seem, one of the most  significant deeds of political violence occurred here in America, in  connection with the Homestead strike of 1892.    During that memorable time the Carnegie Steel Company organized a  conspiracy to crush the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel  Workers.  Henry Clay Frick, then Chairman of the Company, was  intrusted with that democratic task.  He lost no time in carrying out  the policy of breaking the Union, the policy which he had so  successfully practiced during his reign of terror in the coke  regions.  Secretly, and while peace negotiations were being purposely  prolonged, Frick supervised the military preparations, the  fortification of the Homestead Steel Works, the erection of a high  board fence, capped with barbed wire and provided with loopholes for  sharpshooters.  And then, in the dead of night, he attempted to  smuggle his army of hired Pinkerton thugs into Homestead, which act  precipitated the terrible carnage of the steel workers.  Not content  with the death of eleven victims, killed in the Pinkerton skirmish,  Henry Clay Frick, good Christian and free American,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#14)"],[1,"or lowly we may be, to His throne, and ask with our  own lips for those blessings so needful for the soul. AElfric, in a letter  addressed to Sigwerd, prefixed to his Treatise on the Old and New  Testament, thus speaks of his biblical labors:    \"Abbot Elfricke greeteth friendly, Sigwerd at last Heolon. True it is I  tell thee that very wise is he who speaketh by his doings; and well  proceedeth he doth with God and the world who furnisheth himselfe with  good works. And very plaine it is in holy scripture, that holy men  employed in well doing were in this world held in good reputation, and as  saints now enjoy the kingdom of heaven, and the remembrance of them  continueth for ever, because of their consent with God and relying on  him, carelesse men who lead their life in all idleness and so end it, the  memory of them is forgotten in holy writ, saving that the Old Testament  records their ill deeds and how they were therefore comdemned. Thou hast  oft entreated me for English Scripture .... and when I was with thee  great mone thou madest that thou couldst get none of my writings. Now  will I that thou have at least this little, since knowledge is so  acceptable to thee, and thou wilt have it rather than be altogether  without my books...... God bestoweth sevenfold grace on mankind, (whereof  I have already written in another English Treatise,) as the prophet  Isaiah hath recorded in the book of his prophesie.\" In speaking of the  remaining books of the Pentateuch, he does so in a cursory manner, and  excuses himself because he had \"written thereof more at large.\" \"The book  which Moses wrote, called the book of Joshua, sheweth how he went with  the people of Israel unto Abraham's country, and how he won it, and how  the sun stood still while he got the victory, and how he divided the  land; this book also I turned into English for prince Ethelverd, wherein  a man may behold the great wonders of God really fulfilled.\" ......  \"After him known it is that there were in the land certaine judges over  Israel, who guided the people as it is written in the book of Judges  ..... of this whoso hath desire to hear further, may read it in that  English book which I translated concerning the same.\" ..... \"Of the book  of Kings, I have translated also some part into English,\" \"the book of  Esther, I briefly after my manner translated into English,\" and \"The  Widow Judith who overcame Holophernes, the Syrian General, hath her book  also, among these, concerning her own victory and _Englished according to  my skill for your example_, that ye men may also defend your country by  force of arms, against the invasion of a foreign host.\" \"Two books of  Machabeus, to the glory of God, I have turned also into English, and so  read them, you may if you please, for your instruction.\" And at the end  we find him again admonishing the scribes to use the pen with  faithfulness. \"Whosoever,\" says he, \"shall write out this book, let him  write it according to the copy, and for God's love correct it, that it be  not faulty, less he thereby be discredited, and I shent.\"[103]    This learned prelate died on the 16th of November, 1006, after a life  spent thus in the service of Christ and the cause of learning; by his  will he bequeathed to the Abbey of St. Alban's, besides some landed  possessions, his little library of books;[104] he was honorably buried at  Abingdon, but during the reign of Canute, his bones were removed to  Canterbury.    Passing on a few years, we come to that period when a new light shone  upon the lethargy of the Saxons; the learning and erudition which had  been fostering in the snug monasteries of Normandy, hitherto  silent--buried as it were--but yet fast growing to maturity, accompanied  the sword of the Norman duke, and added to the glory of the conquering  hero, by their splendid intellectual endowments. All this emulated and  roused the Saxons from their slumber; and, rubbing their laziness away,  they again grasped the pen with the full nerve and energy of their  nature; a reaction ensued, literature was respected, learning prospered,  and copious work flowed in upon the scribes; the crackling of parchment,  and the din of controversy bespoke the presence of this revival in the  cloisters of the English monasteries; books, the weapons spiritual of the  monks, libraries, the magazines of the church militant were preserved,  amassed, and at last deemed indispensable.[105] Such was the effect on  our national literature of that gushing in of the Norman conquerors, so  deeply imbued with learning, so polished, and withal so armed with  classical and patristic lore were they.    Foremost in the rank we find the learned Lanfranc, that patron of  literature, that indefatigable scribe and anxious book collector, who was  endowed with an erudition far more deep and comprehensive than any other  of his day. He was born at Pavia, in 1005, and received there the first  elements of his education;[106] he afterwards went to Bologna, and from  thence to Avranches, where he undertook the education of many celebrated  scholars of that century, and instructed them in sacred and secular  learning, _in sacris et secularibus erudivi literis_.[107] Whilst  proceeding on a journey to Rome he was attacked by some robbers, who  maltreated and left him almost dead; in this condition he was found by  some peasants who conveyed him to the monastery of Bec; the monks with  their usual hospitable charity tended and so assiduously nourished him in  his sickness, that on his recovery he became one of their fraternity. A  few years after, he was appointed prior and founded a school there, which  did immense service to literature and science; he also collected a great  library which was renowned and esteemed in his day,[108] and he increased  their value by a critical revisal of their text. He was well aware that  in works so voluminous as those of the fathers, the scribes through so  many generations could not be expected to observe an unanimous  infallibility; but knowing too that even the most essential doctrines of  the holy and catholic church were founded on patristical authority, he  was deeply impressed with the necessity of keeping their writings in all  their primitive integrity; an end so desirable, well repaid the  tediousness of the undertaking, and he cheerfully spent much time in  collecting and comparing codices, in studying their various readings or  erasing the spurious interpolations, engendered by the carelessness or  the pious frauds of monkish scribes.[109] He lavished his care in a  similar manner on the Bible: considering the far distant period from  which that holy volume has descended to us, it is astounding that the  vicissitudes, the perils, the darkness of near eighteen hundred years,  have failed to mar the divinity of that sacred book; not all the blunders  of nodding scribes could do it, not all the monkish interpolations, or  the cunning of sectarian pens could do it, for in all times the faithful  church of Christ watched over it with a jealous care, supplied each  erasure and expelled each false addition. Lanfranc was one of the most  vigilant of these Scripture guards, and his own industry blest his church  with the bible text, purified from the gross handmarks of human meddling.  I learn, from the Benedictines of St. Maur, that there is still preserved  in the Abbey of St. Martin de Secz, the first ten conferences of Cassian  corrected by the efficient hand of this great critical student, at the  end of the manuscript these words are written, \"_Hucusque ago Lanfrancus  correxi_.\"[110] The works of St. Ambrose, on which he bestowed similar  care, are preserved in the library of St. Vincent du Mans.[111]    When he was promoted to the See of Canterbury, he brought with him a  copious supply of books, and spread the influence of his learning over  the English monasteries; but with all the cares inseparably connected  with the dignity of Primate of England, he still found time to gratify  his bookloving propensities, and to continue his critical labors; indeed  he worked day and night in the service of the church, _servitio  Ecclesiae_, and in correcting the books which the scribes had  written.[112] From the profusion of his library he was enabled to lend  many volumes to the monks, so that by making transcripts, they might add  to their own stores--thus we know that he lent to Paulen, Abbot of St.  Albans, a great number, who kept his scribes hard at work transcribing  them, and built a scriptorium for the transaction of these pleasing  labors; but more of this hereafter.    Anselm, too, was a renowned and book-loving prelate, and if his pride and  haughtiness wrought warm dissensions and ruptures in the church, he often  stole away to forget them in the pages of his book. At an early age he  acquired this fondness for reading, and whilst engaged as a monkish  student, he applied his mind to the perusal of books with wonderful  perseverance, and when some favorite volume absorbed his attention, he  could scarce leave it night or day.[113] Industry so indefatigable  ensured a certain success, and he became eminent for his deep and  comprehensive learning; his epistles bear ample testimony to his  extensive reading and intimate acquaintance with the authors of  antiquity;[114] in one of his letters he praises a monk named Maurice,  for his success in study, who was learning _Virgil_ and some other old  writers, under Arnulph the grammarian.    All day long Anselm was occupied in giving wise counsel to those that  needed it; and a great part of the night _pars maxima noctis_ he spent in  correcting his darling volumes, and freeing them from the inaccuracies of  the scribes.[115] The oil in the lamp burnt low, still that bibliomaniac  studiously pursued his favorite avocation. So great was the love of  book-collecting engrafted into his mind, that he omitted no opportunity  of obtaining them--numerous"]]]
