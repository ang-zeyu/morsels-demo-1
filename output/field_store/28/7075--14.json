I suppose he wouldn't have anything to say  to you.\"    \"Maybe not,\" said Mickey.    \"It would be a good joke if he should lose his place and have to go back  to boot-blacking again.\"    \"I wish he would,\" said Micky, fervently. \"It 'ould cure him of puttin'  on airs.\"    \"If, for example, his employer should be convinced that he was a thief,  he would discharge him.\"    \"Do you know him, mister?\" asked Micky, looking up suddenly.    \"Yes.\"    \"Is he a friend of yours?\"    \"I like him about as well as you do,\" said Gilbert.    \"Done!\" said Micky, releasing the second foot.    \"Suppose you brush the other boot again. I'll pay you double. I want to  talk to you a little.\"    \"All right!\" said Micky, and he resumed operations.    The conversation that followed we do not propose to chronicle. The  results will appear hereafter. Enough that Gilbert and Micky departed  mutually satisfied, the latter the richer by five times his usual fee.          CHAPTER XII.    DICK FALLS INTO A TRAP.      One evening, when Dick and Fosdick returned from their respective  stores, a surprise awaited them.    \"The postman left some letters for you,\" said the servant, as she opened  the door to admit them.    \"Maybe they're from the tax-collectors,\" said Dick. \"That's the  misfortun' of being men of property. What was your tax last year,  Fosdick?\"    \"I don't remember such trifles,\" said Fosdick.    \"I don't think they was taxes,\" said the girl, seriously; \"they looked  as if they was from a young lady.\"    \"Very likely they are from Fosdick's wife,\" said Dick. \"She's  rusticatin' in the country for the benefit of her health.\"    \"Maybe they're from yours, Mr. Hunter,\" said the girl, laughing.    \"No,\" said Dick, gravely, \"I'm a disconsolate widower, which accounts  for my low spirits most of the time, and my poor appetite. Where are the  letters?\"    \"I left them on the bureau in your room,\" said the servant. \"They come  this afternoon at three o'clock.\"    Both Fosdick and Dick felt not a little curious as to who could have  written them letters, and hastened upstairs. Entering their chamber,  they saw two very neat little notes, in perfumed French envelopes, and  with the initial G in colors on the back. On opening them they read the  following in a neat, feminine, fine handwriting. As both were alike, it  will be sufficient to give Dick's.         \"Miss Ida Greyson presents her compliments to Mr. Richard Hunter,       and solicits the pleasure of his company on Thursday evening next,       at a little birthday party.         \"_No._ -- _West Twenty-Fourth Street._\"    \"We're getting fashionable,\" said Dick. \"I didn't use to attend many  parties when we lived in Mott Street and blacked boots for a livin'. I'm  afraid I shan't know how to behave.\"    \"I shall feel a little bashful,\" said Fosdick; \"but I suppose we've got  to begin some time.\"    \"Of course,\" said Dick. \"The important position we hold in society makes  it necessary. How'll I be able to hold levees when I'm mayor, if I don't  go into society now?\"    \"Very true,\" said Fosdick; \"I don't expect to occupy any such position;  but we ought to go in acknowledgment of Mr. Greyson's kindness.\"    Mr. Greyson was the teacher of the Sunday-school class of which both  Dick and Fosdick were members. His recommendation had procured Fosdick  his present place, and he had manifested his kindness in various ways.  Those who have read \"Ragged Dick\" will remember that he had a very  sprightly and engaging daughter of ten years of age, who seemed to have  taken an especial fancy to Dick. Being wealthy, his kindness had been of  great service to both boys, inspiring them with self-respect, and  encouraging them to persevere in their efforts to raise themselves to a  higher position.    The dinner-bell rang just as the boys had finished their discussion, and  they went down and took places at the table.    Soon Miss Peyton came sailing in, shaking her ringlets coquettishly. She  was proud of these ringlets, and was never tired of trying their  fascinations upon gentlemen. But somehow they had not succeeded in  winning a husband.    \"Good-evening, Mr. Hunter,\" said she. \"You look as if you had had good  news.\"    \"Do I?\" said Dick. \"Perhaps you can tell what it is.\"    \"I know how it came,\" said Miss Peyton, significantly.    \"Then I hope you won't keep me in suspense any longer than you can  help.\"    \"Perhaps you'd rather I wouldn't mention before company.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Dick. \"Don't have any regard to my feelin's. They're  tough, and can stand a good deal.\"    \"How do you like the letter G?\" asked Miss Peyton, slyly.    \"Very much,\" said Dick, \"as long as it behaves itself. What is your  favorite letter?\"    \"Don't think I'm going to tell you, Mr. Hunter. That was a pretty little  note, and in a young lady's hand too.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"Perhaps you'd like to see it.\"    \"You wouldn't show it to me on any account, I know.\"    \"You may see it if you like,\" said Dick.    \"May I, really? I should like to very much; but would the young lady  like it?\"    \"I don't think she'd mind. She's written one to my friend Fosdick just  like it.\"    Dick passed the invitation across the table.    \"It's very pretty indeed,\" said Miss Peyton. \"And is Miss Ida Greyson  very handsome?\"    \"I'm no judge of beauty,\" said Dick.    \"So she lives in West Twenty-Fourth Street. Is her father rich?\"    \"I don't know how rich,\" said Dick; \"but my impression is that his taxes  last year were more than mine.\"    \"I know now what your favorite letters are,\" said Miss Peyton. \"They are  I. G.\"    \"I. G. are very well as long as you don't put P. before them,\" said  Dick. \"Thank you for another cup of tea, Mrs. Browning.\"    \"I should think you'd need some tea after such a brilliant effort,  Hunter,\" said Mr. Clifton, from across the table.    \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"I find my brain gets exhausted every now and then by  my intellectual efforts. Aint you troubled that way?\"    \"Can't say I am. Don't you want to go out and try a game of billiards  this evening?\"    \"No, thank you. I've got to study.\"    \"I expect to see you a college professor some of these days.\"    \"I haven't made up my mind yet,\" said Dick. \"I'm open to an offer, as  the oyster remarked when he was placed on the table. If I can serve my  fellow-men best by bein' a college professor, and gettin' a big salary,  I'm willin' to sacrifice my private feelin's for the public good.\"    \"Do you agree with your friend, Mr. Fosdick?\" said Miss Peyton. \"Won't  you favor us with your views?\"    \"I have none worth mentioning,\" said Fosdick. \"I leave my friend to do  the talking, while I attend to the eating.\"    \"Mr. Hunter's remarks are very entertaining,\" said Miss Peyton.    \"Thank you,\" said Dick; \"but my friend prefers a different kind of  entertainment.\"    The boys rose from the table, and went up to their room to look over the  evening's lessons. They were quite pleased with their new teacher, whom  they found not only competent for his task, but interested in promoting  their progress. He was able to help them readily out of their  difficulties, and encouraged them to persevere. So they came to look  forward to their evening lessons not as tasks, but as pleasant  exercises.    \"It's strange,\" said Dick, one evening after the teacher had left them;  \"I used to enjoy goin' to the Old Bowery so much. I went two or three  times a week sometimes. Now I would a good deal rather stay at home and  study.\"    \"Then you didn't have a home, and the lighted theatre must have been  much pleasanter than the cold and cheerless streets.\"    \"Yes, that was it. I used to get so tired sometimes of having no home to  go to, and nobody to speak to that I cared about.\"    \"You'd hardly like to go back to the old life, Dick?\"    \"No, it would come pretty hard to me now. I didn't seem to mind it so  much then.\"    \"Because you had never known anything better.\"    \"No. It was a lucky day when I met you, Fosdick. I'd never have had the  patience to learn. Readin', or tryin' to read, always gave me the  headache.\"    \"You always leave off the last letter in such words as 'reading,' Dick.  You should be more careful, now that you associate with educated  persons.\"    \"I know it, Fosdick, but I'm so used to droppin'--I mean dropping--the g  that it comes natural. I will try to remember it. But about this  party,--shall we have to get new clothes?\"    \"No, we have each a nice suit, and we shan't be expected to dress in the  height of the fashion.\"    \"I wish it was over. I dread it.\"    \"So do I a little; but I think we shall enjoy it. Ida is a nice girl.\"    \"That's so. If I had a sister I'd like her to be like Ida.\"    \"Perhaps she'd like a brother like you. I notice she seems to fancy your  company.\"    \"I hope you're not jealous, Fosdick. You can be a brother to Miss  Peyton, you know.\"    Fosdick laughed. \"There's no chance for me there either,\" he said. \"She  evidently prefers you.\"    \"I'll adopt her for my aunt if it'll be gratifying to her feelings,\"  said Dick; \"but I aint partial to ringlets as a general thing.\"    It is well perhaps that Miss Peyton did not hear these remarks, as she  cherished the idea that both Fosdick and Dick were particularly pleased  with her.    A day or two afterwards Dick was walking leisurely through Chatham  Street, about half past one o'clock. He was allowed an hour, about noon,  to go out and get some lunch, and he was now on his way from the  restaurant which he usually frequented. As it was yet early, he paused  before a window to look at something which attracted his attention.  While standing here he became conscious of a commotion in his immediate  neighborhood. Then he felt a hand thrust into the side-pocket of his  coat, and instantly withdrawn. Looking up, he saw Micky Maguire dodging  round the corner. He put his hand into his pocket mechanically, and drew  out a pocket-book.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#14)"],[1," the  little railway, propels the coach at a rapid rate by means of the  invisible agent. One goes forth into the street, past wax figures of  armed and mounted mail-messengers in the Middle Ages, past the model  street mail-boxes and carriages which help to make so wonderful the  Berlin postal arrangements, in a maze at what may here be seen in a  single half-hour of the history of mail-carrying in all lands and  ages. The originator of this \"Post Museum\" is Dr. Stephan, the  inventor of the postal card and the chief promoter of the  International Postal Union. His is the \"power behind the throne\" which  has made the German postal system a marvel of efficiency, unsurpassed,  if not unrivalled, in the world.    Less known to travellers than many others far inferior in interest, is  the Hohenzollern Museum, occupying the Monbijou Palace in the heart of  Berlin. This palace, of so much interest to the readers of Carlyle's  \"Frederick the Great,\" has been transformed into a repository for the  personal belongings and memorials of the kings and queens of Prussia.  One or more rooms devoted to each sovereign in historical succession  make up a fascinating picture of the royal customs of the kingdom for  two hundred years. Our attention was called to this museum by an  English resident, but its interest far exceeded our expectations. Here  are the laces, jewels, and often the entire wardrobes of the  Hohenzollern queens, with their writing desks and tablets,  jewel-cases, embroidery, work-baskets, mirrors, beds, and other  furniture; and the kings have each their own apartment likewise,  tenanted by their \"counterfeit presentments\" in wax, sitting or  standing in the very clothes they wore, and surrounded by visible  mementos of the life they used to live. The glittering eyes and  mundane expression of Frederick William I., father of Frederick the  Great, give one a strange feeling, and the chairs and table of his  \"Tobacco College\" must have a vivid interest for every reader of  Carlyle's \"Frederick.\" But when we entered the rooms containing the  many mementos of the Great Frederick himself, from his effigy in the  cradle and his baby shoes, and threaded all the vicissitudes of that  strangely fascinating life by the help of its visible surroundings,  and finally stood before the glass case containing a mask of his dead  face and hand surrounded by its laurel wreath, the spell of the past  was at its height. It was a bright sunny afternoon, and the golden  light came in long slanting lines through windows opening on Monbijou  gardens, beautiful even in winter, and lay upon the tessellated floors  of the corridors in patterns of shining glory. The chat and laughter  of young companions floated from adjoining rooms, and the foot of the  guard fell softly in the marble halls. But a kind of awe born of that  wonderful past had taken possession of me. I was alone with the spirit  of the Great Monarch, and it was more than could be borne. We hurried  away from the spot, as when children we fled from fancied ghosts. To  one in search of a genuine sensation, we recommend the reading (with  judicious skipping) of Carlyle's \"Frederick the Great,\" and a visit,  alone or with a single companion, to the Hohenzollern Museum.    Upwards of twenty years ago, German trade was falling behind in the  best markets of the world, because the products of German industry  were largely poor in quality and deficient in artistic value. With the  Duke of Ratisbon, President of the Herrenhaus, as chairman of a  committee appointed to consider the subject, a few leading minds  combined in a movement which issued in the establishment of the  Industrial Art Museum. The Crown Prince and the Crown Princess were  much interested in the subject, and gave the plan their hearty  support. Less than ten years since, the fine new building in Zimmer  Strasse near Koeniggraetzer was opened on the birthday of the Crown  Princess, to receive the vast treasures accumulated, by gift, loan,  and purchase, for the permanent exhibition. A cursory visit, though  most interesting, is sometimes bewildering from the extent and variety  of the collection. The centre of the edifice consists of a large  court, roofed with glass and surrounded by two galleries. This is the  place reserved for loan exhibitions, and several of importance have  already been held here. One of the earlier was of some of the  treasures of the South Kensington Museum, loaned by Queen Victoria.  Opening upon these arcades are numerous halls on the lower floor,  devoted to the permanent exhibition. The classification of the objects  exhibited, if not loose, is very general, seeming to us inferior to  the method which makes the South Kensington a delight, whether one has  hours or months in which to visit it. On the ground floor of this  Berlin Museum are \"objects in the making of which fire is not used.\"  This includes domestic and ecclesiastical furniture of different  countries and historical periods, musical instruments, tapestries,  carvings in ivory and wood, and many other objects widely separated in  thought. A fine exhibit is made of articles in amber wrought by  workmen of rich old Dantzic, for which Baltic Germany furnishes the  raw material. The ancient Italian carved bridal-chests brought vividly  to mind our childhood's favorite story of Ginevra, by chance  imprisoned in such a chest on the day which was to have witnessed her  marriage.    The upper floor, with an arrangement similar to that of the lower,  shows \"objects in the manufacture of which fire is necessary.\" The  very extensive collection of pottery and porcelain was surpassed, in  our observation, only by that at Sevres; and there are many rare and  valuable specimens of work in glass and metals. The ancient municipal  silver service of the city of Lueneberg, bought at a cost of $165,000,  deserves the attention it attracts; and the work of German mediaeval  goldsmiths--particularly of the famous Augsburg artisans--is a  revelation of the possibilities of human handiwork. Stained glass, of  much historic and artistic value, fills the windows of the entire  building. The specimens of textile fabrics, in completeness and  extent, are matchless, and are so arranged as to afford the utmost  facility to students of the history of this important subject, as well  as great pleasure to the favored visitor who has the opportunity to  inspect them.    This \"Kuenstgewerbe Museum\" is open to the public without charge on  three days of the week, and for a small fee on the remaining days;  while its valuable industrial library may be freely consulted on four  week-day evenings. Its influence is already strongly felt along the  lines of trade and industry throughout the Empire.    The great Ethnographical Museum adjoining, on the corner of  Koeniggraetzer Strasse, has the kind and variety of objects usually  found in such exhibitions, including those connected with several  races of American Indians. The other departments were, to us, eclipsed  in interest by the Schliemann exhibition of Trojan remains on the  ground floor. Here we found, on the walls, framed pencil or India ink  sketches of the localities where the earlier excavations were made,  plans of the work, sections of the unearthed portions, and the  precious old Trojan antiquities themselves, deposited here for  inspection and safe keeping.    The Maerkische Museum, in the Fisch Markt, a centre of Old Berlin,  illustrates the history and the prehistoric times of the Mark of  Brandenburg, including an interesting department of curiosities from  the lake-dwellings and tumuli. There are also ancient coins and other  objects picked up at different times within the province. One of the  later treasures of this unique museum is the box from which the monk  Tetzel sold the indulgences which fanned into a flame the rising fires  of the Reformation.          VI.    THE GERMAN REICHSTAG AND THE PRUSSIAN PARLIAMENT.      The Reichstag, or Imperial Diet of the German Empire, was, during our  stay in Berlin, a focus for the eyes of all Europe and America. The  Government, professedly actuated by a fear of war, asked for an  appropriation, largely to increase the army annually for a term of  seven years. This House of Deputies, elected by the people and  numbering nearly four hundred members, contained a considerable  element of opposition to the Government. The debate over the Army Bill  brought Chancellor Bismarck up from his distant country-seat, where he  had spent several previous months, to a participation in the contest  which was anticipated on both sides with eagerness and solicitude.    The building on Leipziger Strasse, as severe in inner details as in  the sombre gray of its outer walls, was hastily constructed in 1871  for the accommodation of the newly consolidated German Empire, and has  long been inadequate to the need. A single gallery surrounds three  sides of the hall, and is occupied on the right by boxes for the  Imperial household, the diplomatic corps, and high officials. The left  is appropriated to English and American visitors; and the centre,  immediately above the desk of the presiding officer and the elevated  seats of the Chancellor and members of the Bundesrath, is alone left  for the general public. When the new building near the Thiergarten  shall be occupied, it is hoped that greatly improved acoustics and  ventilation may be secured, and the accommodations for visitors such  that it may not be said that there are Germans in Berlin who have for  years desired visitors' tickets of admission without having been able  to secure them.    By a singular good fortune, our tickets gave us seats for this debate  in full view of the leaders of each of the great parties. On the  first day the Prime Minister made his great speech, and on the second  day thereafter, Richter, the leader of the progressive party, took up  the speech point by point, and with bold and"]]]
