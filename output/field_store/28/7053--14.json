When the swamp is drained it means that the otter, the mink, and the  Wild Duck must go, but the meadowland that takes the place of the swamp  {127} provides for an increased number of other species of wild life.    [Illustration: Passenger Pigeons Are Now Extinct]    _Effect of Forest Devastation._--Only in a comparatively few cases has  bird life suffered from the destruction of forests.  In parts of the  Middle West the Woodpeckers have no doubt decreased in {128} numbers.  There are places where one may travel for many miles without seeing a  single grove in which these birds could live.    Passenger Pigeons as late as 1870 were frequently seen in enormous  flocks.  Their numbers during the periods of migration was one of the  greatest ornithological wonders of the world.  Now the birds are gone.  What is supposed to have been the last one died in captivity in the  Zoological Park of Cincinnati at 2 P. M. on the afternoon of September  1, 1914.  Despite the generally accepted statement that these birds  succumbed to the guns, snares, and nets of hunters, there is a second  cause which doubtless had its effect in hastening the disappearance of  the species.  The cutting away of vast forests where the birds were  accustomed to gather and feed on mast greatly restricted their feeding  range.  They collected in enormous colonies for the purpose of rearing  their young, and after the forests of the Northern States were so  largely destroyed the birds seem to have been driven far up into  Canada, quite {129} beyond their usual breeding range.  Here, as  Forbush suggests, the summer probably was not sufficiently long to  enable them to rear their young successfully.    [Illustration: Window \"Cafeteria,\" at home of Mrs. Granville Pike,  North Yakima, Washington.  The birds here seen at their lunch are the  Goldfinch, Housefinch, and Oregon Junco.]    The Ivory-billed Woodpecker, the largest member of the Woodpecker  family found in the United States, is now nearly extinct.  There are  some in the wilder regions of Florida, and a few in the swamps of upper  Louisiana, but nowhere does the bird exist in numbers.  It has been  thought by some naturalists that the reduction of the forest areas was  responsible for this bird's disappearance, but it is hard to believe  that this fact alone was sufficient to affect them so seriously, for  the birds live mainly in swamps, and in our Southern States there are  extensive lowland regions that remain practically untouched by the  axeman.  For some reason, however, the birds have been unable to  withstand the advance of civilization, and like the Paroquet, the  disappearance of which is almost equally difficult to explain, it will  soon be numbered with the lengthening list of species that have passed  away.    {130}    The Commercializing of Birds.--With the exceptions noted above the  birds that have noticeably decreased in numbers in North America are  those on whose heads a price has been set by the markets.  Let a demand  once arise for the bodies or the feathers of a species, and immediately  a war is begun upon it that, unless speedily checked, spells disaster  for the unfortunate bird.    _The Labrador Duck and Others._--A hundred years ago the Labrador Duck,  known to Audubon as the \"Pied Duck,\" was abundant in the waters of the  North Atlantic, and it was hunted and shot regularly in fall, winter,  and spring, along the coast of New England and New York.  Their  breeding grounds were chiefly on the islands and along the shores of  Labrador, as well as on the islands and mainland about the Gulf of St.  Lawrence.  Any one over forty years of age will remember how very  popular feather beds used to be.  In fact, there are those of us who  know from experience that in many rural sections the deep feather bed  is still regarded as the _piece de {131} resistance_ of the careful  householder's equipment.  There was a time when the domestic poultry of  New England did not furnish as great a supply of feathers as was  desired.  Furthermore, \"Eider down\" was recognized as the most  desirable of all feathers for certain domestic uses.    A hundred and fifty years ago New England sea-faring men frequently  fitted out vessels and sailed to the Labrador coast in summer on  \"feather-voyages.\"  The feathers sought were those of the Labrador Duck  and the Eider.  These adventurous bird pirates secured their booty  either by killing the birds or taking the down from the nests.  The  commercializing of the Labrador Duck meant its undoing.  The last one  known to have been taken was killed by a hunter near Long Island, New  York, in 1875.  Forty-two of these birds only are preserved in the  ornithological collections of the whole world.    Another species which succumbed to the persistent persecution of  mankind was the Great Cormorant that at one time was extremely abundant  in the {132} northern Pacific and Bering Sea.  They were killed for  food by Indians, whalers, and others who visited the regions where the  birds spend the summer.  The Great Cormorant has been extinct in those  waters since the year 1850.    Great Auks were once numbered literally by millions in the North  Atlantic.  They were flightless and exceedingly fat.  They were easily  killed with clubs on the breeding rookeries, and provided an acceptable  meat supply for fishermen and other toilers of the sea; also their  feathers were sought.  They were very common off Labrador and  Newfoundland.  Funk Island, especially, contained an enormous breeding  colony.    For years fishermen going to the Banks in early summer depended on Auks  for their meat supply.  The birds probably bred as far south as  Massachusetts, where it is known a great many were killed by Indians  during certain seasons of the year.  However, it was the white man who  brought ruin to this magnificent sea-fowl, for the savage Indians were  {133} too provident to exterminate any species of bird or animal.  The  Great Auk was last seen in America between 1830 and 1840, and the final  individual, so far as there is any positive record, was killed off  Iceland in 1841.  About eighty specimens of this bird, and seventy  eggs, are preserved in the Natural History collections of the world.    [Illustration: The Great Auk, Another Extinct Bird]    The Trumpeter Swan and the Whooping Crane are nearly extinct to-day.  Constant shooting and {134} the extensive settling of the prairies of  the Northwest have been the causes of their disappearance.    _Diminution of Other Species._--Of the fifty-five kinds of Wild Ducks,  Geese, and Swans commonly found in North America, there is probably not  one as numerous to-day as it was a hundred or even fifty years ago.  Why?  The markets where their bodies commanded a price of so much per  head have swallowed them up.  The shotgun has also played havoc with  the Prairie Chicken and the Sage Grouse.  Of the former possibly as  many as one thousand exist on the Heath Hen Reservation of Martha's  Vineyard, Massachusetts, a pitiful remnant of the eastern form of the  species.  Even in the Prairie States wide ranges of country that  formerly knew them by tens of thousands now know them no more.    We might go farther and note also the rapidly decreasing numbers of the  Sandhill Crane and the Limpkin of Florida.  They are being shot for  food.  The large White Egret, the Snowy Egret, and the Roseate  Spoonbill are found in lessening numbers each {135} year because they  have been commercialized.  There is a demand in the feather trade which  can be met only by the use of their plumage, and as no profitable means  has been devised for raising these birds in captivity the few remaining  wild ones must be sacrificed, for from the standpoint of the killers it  is better that a few men should become enriched by bird slaughter than  that many people should derive pleasure from the birds which add so  much beauty and interest to the landscape.    _Change of Nesting Habits._--The nesting habits of some birds have been  revolutionized by the coming of civilization to the American  wilderness.  The Swallow family provides three notable examples of  this.  The Cliff Swallow and Barn Swallow that formerly built their  nests on exposed cliffs now seek the shelter of barns and other  outbuildings for this purpose.  The open nest of the Barn Swallow is  usually found on the joists of hay barns and large stables and not  infrequently on similar supports of wide verandas.  The Cliff Swallow  builds its gourd-shaped {136} mud nest under the eaves and hence is  widely known as the Eaves Swallow.  No rest of any kind in the form of  a projecting beam is needed, as the bird skilfully fastens the mud to  the vertical side of the barn close up under the overhanging roof.  In  such a situation it is usually safe from all beating rains.  The Cliff  Swallow has exhibited wisdom to no mean extent in exchanging the more  or less exposed rocky ledge for the safety of sheltering eaves.  Swallows show a decided tendency to gather in colonies in the breeding  season.  Under the eaves of a warehouse on the cost of Maine I once  counted exactly one hundred nests of these birds, all of which appeared  to be inhabited.  Examination of another building less than seventy  feet away added thirty-seven occupied nests to the list.    The nesting site of the Purple Martin has likewise been changed in a  most radical fashion.  Originally these birds built their nests of  leaves, feathers, and grass, in hollow trees.  Here no doubt they were  often disturbed by weasels, squirrels, snakes, and {137} other  consumers of birds and their eggs.  Some of the southern Indians hung  gourds up on poles and the Martins learned to build their nests in  them.

THE PURITANS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY COMPANY AND THEIR GOVERNMENT,  COMMENCING IN 1629.      PART I.    FIRST SETTLEMENT--ROYAL CHARTER GRANTED.      English Puritanism, transferred from England to the head of  Massachusetts Bay in 1629, presents the same characteristics which it  developed in England. In Massachusetts it had no competitor; it  developed its principles and spirit without restraint; it was absolute  in power from 1629 to 1689, and during that sixty years it assumed  independence of the Government to which it owed its corporate existence;  it made it a penal crime for any emigrant to appeal to England against a  local decision of Courts or of Government; it permitted no oath of  allegiance to the King, nor the administration of the laws in his name;  it allowed no elective franchise to any Episcopalian, Presbyterian,  Baptist, Quaker, or Papist. Every non-member of the Congregational  Churches was compelled to pay taxes and bear all other Puritan burdens,  but was allowed no representation by franchise, much less by eligibility  for any office.    It has been seen that the \"_Pilgrim_ Fathers\" commenced their settlement  at New Plymouth in 1620--nine years before the \"_Puritan_ Fathers\"  commenced their settlement on the opposite side of Massachusetts Bay,  making Boston their ultimate seat of government. The Pilgrim Fathers and  their descendants were professedly congregational separatists from the  Church of England; they had fled by stealth, under severe sufferings,  from persecution in England to Holland, where they had resided eleven  years and upwards, and where they had learned the principles of  religious toleration and liberty--the fruit of Dutch Arminian advocacy  and suffering. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Company emigrated  directly from England, on leaving which they professed to be members of  the Church of England; their emigration commenced in 1628, the very year  that Charles the First, having quarrelled with and dissolved the last of  three Parliaments in less than four years, commenced his eleven years'  rule without a Parliament. During that eleven years a constant current  of emigration flowed from England to Massachusetts Bay, to the extent of  13,000, including no less than seventy clergymen of the Church of  England, and many men of rank, and wealth to the amount of some  L300,000. All these emigrants, or \"adventurers,\" as they were called,  left England with a stinging sense of royal and episcopal despotism, and  with a corresponding hatred of royalty and episcopacy, but with no  conception of the principles of religious toleration or liberty beyond  themselves.    During the eight years' interval between the settlement of the Pilgrims  at New Plymouth to that of the Puritans at Salem and Boston, trade had  largely increased between England and Massachusetts Bay,[22] and the  climate, fisheries, furs, timber, and other resources of northern New  England became well known, and objects of much interest in England.    King James had divided all that part of North America, 34 deg. and 45 deg. of  North latitude, into two grand divisions, bestowing the southern part  upon a London Company, and the northern part upon a Company formed in  Plymouth and Bristol. The Northern Company resolved to strengthen their  interests by obtaining a fresh grant from the King. A new patent was  issued reorganizing the Company as the Council for the Affairs of New  England, the corporate power of which was to reside at Plymouth, west of  England, under the title of the \"Grand Council of Plymouth,\" with a  grant of three hundred square miles in New England. The Company formed  projects on too large a scale, and did not succeed; but sold that  portion of its territory which constituted the first settlements of the  Massachusetts Bay Company to some merchants in the west of England, who  had successfully fished for cod and bartered for furs in the region of  Massachusetts Bay, and who thought that a plantation might be formed  there. Among the most active encouragers of this enterprise was the Rev.  John White, a clergyman of Dorchester, a maritime town, which had been  the source of much commercial adventure in America.[23] One special  object of Mr. White was to provide an asylum for the ministers who had  been deprived and silenced in England for nonconformity to the canons  and ceremonies imposed by Laud and his associates. Through Mr. White the  guarantees became acquainted with several persons of his religious  sympathies in London, who first associated with them, and afterwards  bought rights in their patent. Among these was Matthew Cradock, the  largest stockholder in the Company, who was appointed its first  president, with eighteen associates, including John Winthrop, Isaac  Johnson, Sir Richard Saltonstall, and other persons of \"like quality.\"  The chief object of these gentlemen in promoting a settlement in New  England was to provide a retreat where their co-religionists of the  Church of England could enjoy liberty in matters of religious worship  and discipline. But the proposed undertaking could not be prosecuted  with success without large means; in order to secure subscriptions for  which the commercial aspect of it had to be prominently presented.    The religious aspect of the enterprise was presented under the idea of  connecting and civilizing the idolatrous and savage Indian tribes of New  England.
