Back next day at the mouth of the Alatna, I was again impressed with the  eligibility of that spot as a mission site. It was but ten miles above  the present native village, and, with church and school established, the  whole population would sooner or later move to it. This gives  opportunity for regulating the building of cabins, and the advantage of  a new, clean start. Moreover, the Alatna River is the highway between  the Kobuk and the Koyukuk, and the Esquimaux coming over in increasing  numbers, would be served by a mission at this place as well as the  Indians. I foresaw two villages, perhaps, on the opposite sides of the  river--one clustered about the church and the school, the other a little  lower down--where these ancient hereditary enemies might live side by  side in peace and harmony under the firm yet gentle influence of the  church. So I staked a mission site, and set up notices claiming ground  for that purpose, almost opposite the mouth of the Alatna, which, in the  native tongue, is Allakaket or Allachaket.    [Sidenote: THE INLAND ESQUIMAUX]    There was some trail up the Alatna and we made fair headway on its  surface, stopping two nights at Kobuk huts. We are out of the Indian  country now, and shall see no more Indians until we are back on the  Yukon. The mode of life, the habits, the character of the races are very  different--the first Esquimau habitation we visited proclaiming it.  These inland Esquimaux, though some of the younger ones have never seen  salt water--our guide, Roxy, for one--are still essentially a salt-water  people. Their huts, even in the midst of trees, are half-underground  affairs, for they have not learned log-building; the windows are of  seal gut, and seal oil is a staple article of their diet. Their clothing  is also marine, their parkees of the hair-seal and their mukluks of the  giant seal. Communications are always kept up with the coast, and the  sea products required are brought across. The time for the movement of  the Kobuks back and forth was not quite yet, though we hoped we should  meet some parties and get the benefit of their trail. Just before we  left the Alatna River we stopped at Roxy's fish cache and got some green  fish, hewing them out of the frozen mass with the axe. The young man had  fished here the previous summer, had cached the fish caught too late to  dry in the sun, and they had remained where he left them for four or  five months. Most of them had begun to decay before they froze, but that  did not impair their value as dog food, though it rendered the cooking  of them a disagreeable proceeding to white nostrils. This caching of  food is a common thing amongst both natives and whites, and it is rarely  that a cache is violated except under great stress of hunger, when  violation is recognised as legitimate. Doughty, in his _Arabia Deserta_,  mentions the same custom amongst the Arabs; Sven Hedin amongst the  Tartars. Sparsely peopled waste countries have much the same customs all  over the world. Even the outer garb in the Oriental deserts has much  resemblance to our parkee; both burnoose and parkee are primarily  windbreaks, and it makes little difference whether the wind be charged  with snow or sand.    At midday on the 3d of February we left the Alatna River and took our  way across country for the Kobuk. We had now no trail at all save what  had been made a couple of months before by the only other party that had  crossed the portage this winter, and it was buried under fifteen or  sixteen inches of snow. There was quite a grade to be climbed to reach  the plateau over which our course lay, and the men, with rope over the  shoulder, had to help the dogs hauling at the sled. Indeed, over a good  deal of this portage, from time to time, the men had to do dog work, for  the country is rolling, one ridge succeeding another, and the loose,  deep snow made heavy and slow going. One man must go ahead breaking  trail, and that was generally my task, though when the route grew  doubtful and the indications too faint for white man's eye, Roxy took my  place and I took his gee pole, and slipped his rope around my chest.    Breaking trail would not be so laborious if one could wear the large  snow-shoes that are used for hunting. But the hunting shoe, though it  carries the man without fatigue, does not help the dogs. The small shoe  known as the trail shoe, packs the snow beneath it, and by the time the  trail breaker has gone forward, then back again, and then forward once  more, the snow is usually packed hard enough to give the dogs some  footing. Footing the dog must have or he cannot pull; a dog wallowing in  snow to his belly cannot exert much traction on the vehicle behind him.  The notion of snow-shoeing as a sport always seems strange to us on the  trail, for to us it is a laborious necessity and no sport at all. The  trail breaker thus goes over most of the ground thrice, and when he is  anxious at the same time to get a fairly accurate estimate by the  pedometer of the distance travelled, he must constantly remember to  upend the instrument in his pocket when he retraces his steps, and  restore it to its recording position when he attacks unbroken snow  again. Also he must take himself unawares, so to speak, from time to  time, and check the length of his stride with the tape measure and alter  the step index as the varying surfaces passed over require.  Conscientiously used, with due regard to its limitations, the pedometer  will give a fair approximation of the length of a journey, but a man can  no more tell how far he has gone by merely hanging a pedometer in his  pocket than he can tell the height above sea-level of an inland mountain  by merely carrying an aneroid barometer to the top.    [Sidenote: THE SUNRISE AND THE MOUNTAINS]    It was on this Alatna-Kobuk portage that we saw the most magnificent  sunrise any of us could remember. It had been cloudy for some days with  threat of snow which did not fall. We were camped in a little hollow  between two ridges, and I had been busy packing up the stuff in the tent  preparatory to the start, when I stepped out with a load of bedding in  my arms, right into the midst of the spectacle. It was simple, as the  greatest things are always simple, but so gorgeous and splendid that it  was startling. The whole southeastern sky was filled with great luminous  bands of alternate purple and crimson. At the horizon the bands were  deeper in tone and as they rose they grew lighter, but they maintained  an unmixed purity of contrasting colour throughout. I gazed at it until  the tent was struck and the dogs hitched and it was time to start, and  then I had to turn my back upon it, for our course lay due west, and I  was breaking trail. But on the crest of the rising ground ahead there  burst upon my delighted eyes a still more astonishing prospect. We were  come to the first near view of the Kobuk mountains, and the reflected  light of that gorgeous sunrise was caught by the flanks of a group of  wild and lofty snow peaks, and they stood up incandescent, with a vivid  colour that seemed to come through them as well as from them. To right  and left, mountains out of the direct path of that light gave a soft  dead mauve, but these favoured peaks, bathed from base to summit in  clear crimson effulgence, glowed like molten metal. It was not the  reflected light of the sun, but of the flaming sky, for even as I  looked, a swift change came over them. They passed through the tones of  red to lightest pink, not fading but brightening, and before my  companions reached me the sun's rays sprang upon the mountains from the  horizon, and they were golden.    It seems almost foolish to the writer and may well seem tedious to the  reader, to attempt in words the description of such scenes; yet so deep  is the impression they produce, and so large the place they take in the  memory, that to omit them would be to strike out much of the charm and  zest of these arctic journeys. Again and again in the years that have  passed, the recollection of that pomp of colour on the way to the Kobuk  has come suddenly upon me, and always with a bounding of the spirit. I  can shut my eyes now and see that incomparable sunrise; I can see again  that vision of mountains filling half the sky with their unimaginable  ardency, and I think that this world never presented nobler sight.  Surely for its pageantry of burning, living colour, for purity and depth  and intensity of tint, the Far North with its setting of snow surpasses  all other regions of the earth.    [Sidenote: TRAVELLING KOBUK LADS]    That same day we met a couple of Kobuk youths on their way to the  Koyukuk, and they gave us the greatest gift it was in the power of man  to give us--a trail! There is no finer illustration of the mutual  service of man to man than the meeting of parties going opposite ways  across the unbroken snows. Each is at once conferring and receiving the  greatest of favours, without loss to himself is heaping benefit on the  other; is, it may be--has often been--saving the other, and being  himself saved. No more hunting and peering for blazes, no more casting  about hither and thither when open stretches are crossed; no more three  times back and forth to beat the snow down--twenty miles a day instead  of ten or twelve--the boys' trail meant all that to us. And our trail  meant almost as much to them. So we were rejoiced to see them, sturdy  youths of sixteen or seventeen, making the journey all by themselves. My  heart goes out to these adventurous Kobuks, amiable, light-hearted,  industrious; keen hunters, following the mountain-sheep far up where the  Indian will not go; adepts in all the wilderness arts; heirs of the  uncharted arctic wastes, and occupying their heritage. If I were not a  white man I would far rather be one of these nomadic inland Esquimaux  than any other native I know of.

I know dat dey done  dat case I seed it wid my own eyes. Dey doctored lots of people an' our  folkses ain't neber had no doctor fer nothin' dat happen.    You wuz axin' 'bout de slave sales, an' I want ter tell you dat I has  seen some real sales an' I'se seed niggers, whole bunches of' em, gwin'  ter Richmond ter be sold. Dey wuz mostly chained, case dey wuz new ter  de boss, an' he doan know what ter 'spect. I'se seed some real sales in  Warrenton too, an' de mammies would be sold from deir chilluns an' dare  would be a whole heap o' cryin' an' mou'nin' 'bout hit. I tell you  folkses ain't lak dey uster be, 'specially niggers. Uster be when a  nigger cries he whoops an' groans an' hollers an' his whole body rocks,  an' dat am de way dey done sometime at de sales.    Speakin' 'bout haints: I'se seed a whole lot o' things, but de worst  dat eber happen wuz 'bout twenty years ago when a han'ts hand hit me  side o' de haid. I bet dat hand weighed a hundred pounds an' it wuz as  cold as ice. I ain't been able ter wuck fer seben days an' nights an' I  still can't turn my haid far ter de left as you sees.    I reckon 'bout de funniest thing 'bout our plantation wuz de  marryin'. A couple got married by sayin' dat dey wuz, but it couldn't  last fer longer dan five years. Dat wuz so iffen one of 'em got too  weakly ter have chilluns de other one could git him another wife or  husban'.    I 'members de day moughty well when de Yankees come. Massa Dick he  walked de floor an' cussed Sherman fer takin' his niggers away. All o'  de niggers lef', of course, an' me, I walked clean ter Raleigh ter find  out if I wuz really free, an' I couldn't unnerstan' half of it.    Well de first year I slept in folkses woodhouses an' barns an' in de  woods or any whar else I could find. I wucked hyar an' dar, but de  folkses' jist give me sompin' ter eat an' my clothes wuz in strings'  fore de spring o' de year.    Yo' axes me what I thinks of Massa Lincoln? Well, I thinks dat he wuz  doin' de wust thing dat he could ter turn all dem fool niggers loose  when dey ain't got no place ter go an' nothin' ter eat. Who helped us  out den? Hit wuzn't de Yankees, hit wuz de white folkses what wuz left  wid deir craps in de fiel's, an' wuz robbed by dem Yankees, ter boot. My  ole massa, fur instance, wuz robbed uv his fine hosses an' his feed  stuff an' all dem kaigs o' liquor what he done make hisself, sides his  money an' silver.    Slavery wuz a good thing den, but de world jist got better an'  outgrowed it.    EH          N. C. District: No. 2                   [320235]  Worker:         Mary A.

C.      I wus bawned in Union County, South Carolina on de plantation o' Doctor  Bogan, who owned both my mammy Issia, an' my pap Edwin. Dar wus six o'  us chilluns; Clara, Lula, Joe, Tux, Mack an' me.    I doan' member much 'bout slavery days 'cept dat my white folkses wus  good ter us. Dar wus a heap o' slaves, maybe a hundert an' fifty. I  'members dat we wucked hard, but we had plenty ter eat an' w'ar, eben  iffen we did w'ar wood shoes.    I kin barely recolleck 'fore de war dat I'se seed a heap o' cocks  fightin' in pits an' a heap o' horse racin'. When de marster winned he  'ud give us niggers a big dinner or a dance, but if he lost, oh!    My daddy wus gived ter de doctor when de doctor wus married an' dey  shore loved each other. One day marster, he comes in an' he sez dat de  Yankees am aimin' ter try ter take his niggers way from him, but dat dey  am gwine ter ketch hell while dey does hit. When he sez dat he starts  ter walkin' de flo'. 'I'se gwine ter leave yore missus in yore keer,  Edwin,' he sez.    But pa 'lows, 'Wid all respec' fer yore wife sar, she am a Yankee too,  an' I'd ruther go wid you ter de war. Please sar, massa, let me go wid  you ter fight dem Yanks.'    At fust massa 'fuses, den he sez, 'All right.' So off dey goes ter de  war, massa on a big hoss, an' my pap on a strong mule 'long wid de  blankets an' things.    Dey tells me dat ole massa got shot one night, an' dat pap grabs de gun  'fore hit hits de earth an' lets de Yanks have hit.    I 'members dat dem wus bad days fer South Carolina, we gived all o' de  food ter de soldiers, an' missus, eben do' she has got some Yankee folks  in de war, l'arns ter eat cabbages an' kush an' berries.    I 'members dat on de day of de surrender, leastways de day dat we hyard  'bout hit, up comes a Yankee an' axes ter see my missus. I is shakin', I  is dat skeerd, but I bucks up an' I tells him dat my missus doan want  ter see no blue coat.    He grins, an' tells me ter skedaddle, an' 'bout den my missus comes out  an' so help me iffen she doan hug dat dratted Yank. Atter awhile I  gathers dat he's her brother, but at fust I ain't seed no sense in her  cryin' an' sayin' 'thank God', over an' over.    Well sar, de massa an' pap what had gone off mad an' healthy an' ridin'  fine beastes comes back walkin' an' dey looked sick. Massa am white as  cotton, an' so help me, iffen my pap, who wuz black as sin, ain't pale  too.    Atter a few years I goes ter wuck in Spartanburg as a houseboy, den I  gits a job wid de Southern Railroad an' I goes ter Charlotte ter  night-watch de tracks.    I stays dar eighteen years, but one night I kills a white hobo who am  tryin' ter rob me o' my gol' watch an' chain, an' dey gives me eighteen  months. I'se been hyar six already. He wus a white man, an' jist a boy,  an' I is sorry, but I comes hyar anyhow.    I hyard a ole 'oman in Charlotte tell onct 'bout witchin' in slavery  times, dar in Mecklenburg County. She wus roun' ninety, so I reckon she  knows. She said dat iffen anybody wanted ter be a witch he would draw a  circle on de groun' jist at de aidge o' dark an' git in de circle an'  squat down.    Dar he had ter set an' talk ter de debil, an' he mus' say, 'I will have  nothin' ter do wid 'ligion, an' I wants you ter make me a witch.' Atter  day he mus' bile a black cat, a bat an' a bunch of herbs an' drink de  soup, den he wuz really a witch.    When you wanted ter witch somebody, she said dat you could take dat  stuff, jist a little bit of hit an' put hit under dat puson's doorsteps  an' dey'd be sick.    You could go thru' de key hole or down de chimney or through de chinks  in a log house, an' you could ride a puson jist lak ridin' a hoss. Dat  puson can keep you outen his house by layin' de broom 'fore de do' an'  puttin' a pin cushion full of pins side of de bed do', iffen he's a mind  to.    Dat puson can kill you too, by drawin' yore pitcher an' shootin' hit in  de haid or de heart too.    Dar's a heap o' ways ter tell fortunes dat she done tol' me but I'se  done forgot now 'cept coffee groun's an' a little of de others.

Dey tole us ole folks we need not put down our walkin'  sticks to git work cause dey jes' won't goin' to put us on.    Well, I had some tomatoes cooked widout any grease for my breakfast. I  had a loaf of bread yesterday, but I et it. I ain't got any check from  the ole age pension an' I have nothin' to eat an' I am hongry. I jes'  looks to God.
