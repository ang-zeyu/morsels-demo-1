Blois is the gateway of the chateaux country; a score of them are  within a day's compass by road or rail; but their delights are worthy  of a volume, so they are only suggested here.    The chateaux of Blois, Chambord, Cheverny, Amboise, Chaumont,  Chenonceaux, Loches, Azay le Rideau, Luynes, and Langeais, at any  rate, must be included in even a hurried itinerary, and so we paid a  hasty visit to them all in the order named, and renewed our  acquaintance with their artistic charms and their historical memories  of the days of Francois and the Renaissance. For the tourist the  chateaux country of the Loire has no beginning and no end. It is a  sort of circular track encompassing both banks of the Loire, and is,  moreover, a thing apart from any other topographical division of  France.    Its luxuriant life, its splendidly picturesque historical monuments,  and the appealing interest of its sunny landscape, throughout the  length and breadth of old Touraine, are unique pages from a volume of  historical and romantic lore which is unequalled elsewhere in all the  world.    The climate, too, combines most of the gentle influences of the  southland, with a certain briskness and clearness of atmosphere  usually found in the north.    By road the Loire valley forms a magnificent promenade; by rail,  even, one can keep in close and constant touch with its whole length;  while, if one has not the time or inclination to traverse its entire  course, there is always the delightful \"tour from town,\" by which one  can leave the Quai d'Orsay by the Orleans line at a comfortable  morning hour and, before lunch-time, be in the midst of the splendour  and plenty of Touraine and its chateaux.    We made our headquarters at Blois, and again at Tours, for three days  each, and we explored the chateaux country, and some other more  humble outlying regions, to our hearts' content.    Blois is tourist-ridden; its hotels are partly of the tourist orders,  and its shopkeepers will sell you \"American form\" shoes and \"best  English\" hats. It is really too bad, for the overpowering splendours  of the chateau, the quaint old Renaissance house-fronts, the streets  of stairs, and the exceedingly picturesque and lively congregation of  countryside peasants on a market-day would make it a delightful  artists' sketching-ground were one not crowded out by \"bounders\" in  bowler hats and others of the genus tripper.    The Hotel d'Angleterre et de Chambord is good, well-conducted, and  well-placed, but it is as unsympathetically disposed an hostelry as  one is likely to find. Just why this is so is inexplicable, unless it  be that it is a frankly tourist hotel.    At Tours we did much better. The praises of the Hotel de l'Univers  are many; they have been sung by most latter-day travellers from  Henry James down; and the Automobile Club de France has bestowed its  recommendation upon it--which it deserves. For all this one is not  wholly at his ease here. We remembered that on one occasion, when we  had descended before its hospitable doors, travel-worn and weary, we  had been pained to find a sort of full-dress dinner going on where we  expected to find an ordinary _table d'hote_. For this reason alone we  passed the hotel by, and hunted out the quaintly named Hotel du  Croissant, in a dimly lighted little back street, indicated by a  flaring crescent of electric lights over its _porte-cochere_.    [Illustration: In Touraine]    We drove our automobile more or less noisily inside the little  flagged courtyard, woke up two dozing cats, who were lying  full-length before us, and disturbed a round dozen of sleek French  commercial travellers at their evening meal.    They treated us remarkably well at Tours's Hotel du Croissant.  \"Follow the _commis-voyageur_ in France and dine well (and cheaply)\"  might readily be the motto of all travellers in France. The bountiful  fare, the local colour, the hearty greeting, and equally hearty  farewell of the _patronne_, and the geniality of the whole personnel  gave us an exceedingly good impression of the contrast between the  tourist hotel of Blois and the _maison bourgeois_ of Tours, always to  the advantage of the latter.    The banks of the Loire immediately below Tours grow the only grape in  France--perhaps in all the world--which is able to produce a  satisfactory substitute for champagne.    Vineyard after vineyard line the banks for miles on either side and  give great crops of the celebrated _vin mosseaux_, the most of which  finds its way to Paris, to be sold by second-rate dealers as the  \"vrai vin de champagne.\" There's no reason why it shouldn't be sold  on its own merits; it is quite good enough; but commerce bows down to  American millionaires, English dukes, and the German emperor, and the  king of wines of to-day must be labelled champagne.    From Tours to Niort is 170 kilometres, and we stopped not on the way  except to admire some particularly entrancing view, to buy gasoline  for the automobile, and for lunch at Poitiers.    The whole aspect of things was changing; there was a breath of the  south already in the air; and there was an unspeakable tendency on  the part of everybody to go to sleep after the midday meal.    We passed Chatellerault and its quaint old turreted and bastioned  bridge at just the hour of noon, and were tempted to stop, for we had  just heard of the latest thing in the way of a hotel which was  brand-new, with steam heat, and hot and cold water, electric lights,  baths, etc. Nothing was said about the bill of fare, though no doubt  it was equally excellent. The combination didn't appeal, however; we  were out after novelty and local colour, and so we rolled on and into  Poitiers's Hotel de l'Europe and lunched well in the most charmingly  cool garden-environed dining-room that it were possible to conceive.  We had made a wise choice, though on a hit-or-miss formula, and we  were content.    Here at least the dim echo of the rustle and bustle of Paris, which  drifts down the valley of the Loire from Orleans to the sea, was left  behind; a whole new chromatic scale was being built up. No one  hurried or rushed about, and one drank a \"_tilleuil_\" after _dejeuner_,  instead of coffee, with the result that he got sleepy forthwith.    There are five magnificent churches at Poitiers, dating from Roman  and mediaeval times, but we saw not one of them as we passed through  the town. Again we had decided we were out after local manners and  customs, and, for the moment, churches were not in the category of  our demands.    We had only faint glimmerings as to where Niort was, or what it stood  for, but we were bound thither for the night. We left Poitiers in  mid-afternoon, gaily enough, but within five kilometres we had  stopped dead. The sparking of course; nothing else would diagnose the  case! It took three hours of almost constant cranking of the unruly  iron monster before the automobile could be made to start again.    Once started, the automobile ran but fitfully the seventy-five  kilometres to Niort, the whole party, with fear and trembling,  scarcely daring to turn sidewise to regard the landscape, or take an  extra breath. There was no assistance to be had this side of Niort,  and should the sparking arrangements go back on us again, and we were  not able to start, there was no hope of being towed in at the back of  a sturdy farm-horse; the distance was too great. Once we thought we  had nearly lost it again, but before we had actually lost our  momentum the thing recovered itself, and we ran fearingly down the  broad avenue into Niort, and asked anxiously as to whether there  might be a _grand maison des automobiles_ in the town.    Indeed there was, and in the twinkling of an eye we had shunted our  poor lame duck into the courtyard of a workshop which gave employment  to something like seventy-five hands, all engaged in the manufacture  of automobiles which were exported to the ends of the earth.    Here was help surely. Nothing could be too great or too small for an  establishment like this to undertake, and so we left the machine with  an easy heart and hunted out the excellent Hotel de France--the best  hotel of its class between Paris and Bordeaux. We dined sumptuously  on all the good things of the north and the south, to say nothing of  fresh sardines from La Rochelle, not far distant, and we gave not a  thought to the automobile again that night, but strolled on the quay  by the little river Sevre-Niortaise, and watched the moon rise over  the old chateau donjon, and heard the rooks caw, and saw them circle  and swing around its battlement in a final night-call before they  went to rest. It was all very idyllic and peaceful, although Niort  is, as may be inferred, an important centre for many things.    We had planned to be on the road again by eight the next morning,  but, on arrival at the garage, or more correctly stated, the _usine_,  where we had left the automobile the night before, we found it the  centre of a curious group who were speculating--and had been since  six o'clock that morning--as to what might be the particular new  variety of disease that had attacked its vital parts so seriously  that it still refused to go.    It was twelve o'clock, high noon, before it was discovered--with the  aid of the electrician from the electric light works--that two tiny  ends of copper wire, inside the coil (which a Frenchman calls a  _bobine_), had become unsoldered, and only when by chance they  rattled into contact would the sparking arrangements work as they  ought.    This was something new for all concerned. None of us will be likely  to be caught that way again. The cost was most moderate. It was not  the automobile owner who paid for the experience this time, a thing  which absolutely could not have happened outside of France. Pretty  much the whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#14)"],[1,"of my friend offered  to conduct us to a quail's nest. Anything in the shape of a nest is  always welcome, it is such a mystery, such a centre of interest and  affection, and, if upon the ground, is usually something so dainty and  exquisite amid the natural wreckage and confusion. A ground nest seems  so exposed, too, that it always gives a little thrill of pleasurable  surprise to see the group of frail eggs resting there behind so slight a  barrier. I will walk a long distance any day just to see a song  sparrow's nest amid the stubble or under a tuft of grass. It is a jewel  in a rosette of jewels, with a frill of weeds or turf. A quail's nest I  had never seen, and to be shown one within the hunting-ground of this  murderous hawk would be a double pleasure. Such a quiet, secluded,  grass-grown highway as we moved along was itself a rare treat.  Sequestered was the word that the little valley suggested, and peace the  feeling the road evoked. The farmer, whose fields lay about us, half  grown with weeds and bushes, evidently did not make stir or noise enough  to disturb anything. Beside this rustic highway, bounded by old mossy  stone walls, and within a stone's throw of the farmer's barn, the quail  had made her nest. It was just under the edge of a prostrate thorn-bush.    \"The nest is right there,\" said the farmer, pausing within ten feet of  it, and pointing to the spot with his stick.    In a moment or two we could make out the mottled brown plumage of the  sitting bird. Then we approached her cautiously till we bent above her.    She never moved a feather.    Then I put my cane down in the brush behind her. We wanted to see the  eggs, yet did not want rudely to disturb the sitting hen.    She would not move.    Then I put down my hand within a few inches of her; still she kept her  place. Should we have to lift her off bodily?    Then the young lady put down her hand, probably the prettiest and the  whitest hand the quail had ever seen. At least it started her, and off  she sprang, uncovering such a crowded nest of eggs as I had never before  beheld. Twenty-one of them! a ring or disk of white like a china  tea-saucer. You could not help saying, How pretty! How cunning! like  baby hens' eggs, as if the bird were playing at sitting, as children  play at housekeeping.    If I had known how crowded her nest was, I should not have dared disturb  her, for fear she would break some of them. But not an egg suffered harm  by her sudden flight. And no harm came to the nest afterward. Every egg  hatched, I was told, and the little chicks, hardly bigger than  bumblebees, were led away by the mother into the fields.    In about a week I paid another visit to the hawk's nest. The eggs were  all hatched, and the mother bird was hovering near. I shall never forget  the curious expression of those young hawks sitting there on the ground.  The expression was not one of youth, but of extreme age. Such an  ancient, infirm look as they had,--the sharp, dark, and shrunken look  about the face and eyes, and their feeble, tottering motions! They sat  upon their elbows and the hind part of their bodies, and their pale,  withered legs and feet extended before them in the most helpless  fashion. Their angular bodies were covered with a pale yellowish down,  like that of a chicken; their heads had a plucked, seedy appearance; and  their long, strong, naked wings hung down by their sides till they  touched the ground: power and ferocity in the first rude draught, shorn  of everything but its sinister ugliness. Another curious thing was the  gradation of the young in size; they tapered down regularly from the  first to the fifth, as if there had been, as probably there was, an  interval of a day or two between the hatchings.    The two older ones showed some signs of fear on our approach, and one of  them threw himself upon his back, and put up his impotent legs, and  glared at us with open beak. The two smaller ones regarded us not at  all. Neither of the parent birds appeared during our stay.    When I visited the nest again, eight or ten days later, the birds were  much grown, but of as marked a difference in size as before, and with  the same look of extreme old age,--old age in men of the aquiline type,  nose and chin coming together, and eyes large and sunken. They now  glared upon us with a wild, savage look, and opened their beaks  threateningly.    The next week, when my friend visited the nest, the larger of the hawks  fought him savagely. But one of the brood, probably the last to hatch,  had made but little growth. It appeared to be on the point of  starvation. The mother hawk (for the male seemed to have disappeared)  had perhaps found her family too large for her, and was deliberately  allowing one of the number to perish; or did the larger and stronger  young devour all the food before the weaker member could obtain any?  Probably this was the case.    Arthur brought the feeble nestling away, and the same day my little boy  got it and brought it home, wrapped in a woolen rag. It was clearly a  starved bantling. It cried feebly but would not lift up its head.    We first poured some warm milk down its throat, which soon revived it,  so that it would swallow small bits of flesh. In a day or two we had it  eating ravenously, and its growth became noticeable. Its voice had the  sharp whistling character of that of its parents, and was stilled only  when the bird was asleep. We made a pen for it, about a yard square, in  one end of the study, covering the floor with several thicknesses of  newspapers; and here, upon a bit of brown woolen blanket for a nest, the  hawk waxed strong day by day. An uglier-looking pet, tested by all the  rules we usually apply to such things, would have been hard to find.  There he would sit upon his elbows, his helpless feet out in front of  him, his great featherless wings touching the floor, and shrilly cry for  more food. For a time we gave him water daily from a stylograph-pen  filler, but the water he evidently did not need or relish. Fresh meat,  and plenty of it, was his demand. And we soon discovered that he liked  game, such as mice, squirrels, birds, much better than butcher's meat.    Then began a lively campaign on the part of my little boy against all  the vermin and small game in the neighborhood, to keep the hawk  supplied. He trapped and he hunted, he enlisted his mates in his  service, he even robbed the cats to feed the hawk. His usefulness as a  boy of all work was seriously impaired. \"Where is J----?\" \"Gone after a  squirrel for his hawk.\" And often the day would be half gone before his  hunt was successful. The premises were very soon cleared of mice, and  the vicinity of chipmunks and squirrels. Farther and farther he was  compelled to hunt the surrounding farms and woods to keep up with the  demands of the hawk. By the time the hawk was ready to fly, it had  consumed twenty-one chipmunks, fourteen red squirrels, sixteen mice, and  twelve English sparrows, besides a great deal of butcher's meat.    His plumage very soon began to show itself, crowding off tufts of the  down. The quills on his great wings sprouted and grew apace. What a  ragged, uncanny appearance he presented! but his look of extreme age  gradually became modified. What a lover of the sunlight he was! We would  put him out upon the grass in the full blaze of the morning sun, and he  would spread his wings and bask in it with the most intense enjoyment.  In the nest the young must be exposed to the full power of the midday  sun during our first heated terms in June and July, the thermometer  often going up to ninety-three or ninety-five degrees, so that sunshine  seemed to be a need of his nature. He liked the rain equally well, and  when put out in a shower would sit down and take it as if every drop did  him good.    His legs developed nearly as slowly as his wings. He could not stand  steadily upon them till about ten days before he was ready to fly. The  talons were limp and feeble. When we came with food, he would hobble  along toward us like the worst kind of a cripple, drooping and moving  his wings, and treading upon his legs from the foot back to the elbow,  the foot remaining closed and useless. Like a baby learning to stand, he  made many trials before he succeeded. He would rise up on his trembling  legs only to fall back again.    One day, in the summer-house, I saw him for the first time stand for a  moment squarely upon his legs with the feet fully spread beneath them.  He looked about him as if the world suddenly wore a new aspect.    His plumage now grew quite rapidly. One red squirrel a day, chopped fine  with an axe, was his ration. He began to hold his game with his foot  while he tore it. The study was full of his shed down. His dark-brown  mottled plumage began to grow beautiful. The wings drooped a little, but  gradually he got control of them, and held them in place.    It was now the 20th of July, and the hawk was about five weeks old. In a  day or two he was walking or jumping about the grounds. He chose a  position under the edge of a Norway spruce, where he would sit for hours  dozing, or looking out upon the landscape. When we brought him game, he  would advance to meet us with wings slightly lifted, and uttering a  shrill cry. Toss him a mouse or sparrow, and he would seize it with one  foot and hop off to his cover, where he would bend above it, spread his  plumage, look this way and that, uttering all the time the most exultant  and satisfied chuckle.    About this time he began to practice striking with his talons, as an  Indian boy might begin practicing with his bow and arrow. He would  strike at a dry leaf in the grass, or at a fallen apple, or at some  imaginary object. He was learning the use of his weapons. His wings  also,--he seemed to feel them sprouting from his shoulders. He would  lift them straight up and hold them expanded, and they would seem to"]]]
