If the long rays were composed of the gas  or gases which constitute the inner corona, it is evident that they  ought to appear in these detached images. As to the nature of the forces  which are continually engaged in shooting out these enormously long  streamers, we have at present but little information. It is, however,  certain that the extensive atmospheric envelope round the sun, which  shows itself as the inner corona, must be extremely attenuated. Comets  have on several occasions been known to rush through this coronal  atmosphere without evincing the slightest appreciable diminution in  their speed from the resistance to which they were exposed.    We have accumulated by observation a great number of facts concerning  the sun, but when we try to draw from these facts conclusions as to the  physical constitution of that great body, it cannot be denied that the  difficulties seem to be very great indeed. We find that the best  authorities differ considerably in the opinions they entertain as to its  nature. We shall here set forth the principal conclusions as to which  there is little or no controversy.    We shall see in a following chapter that astronomers have been able to  determine the relative densities of the bodies in the solar system; in  other words, they have found the relation between the quantities of  matter contained in an equally large volume of each. It has thus been  ascertained that the average density of the sun is about a quarter that  of the earth. If we compare the weight of the sun with that of an  equally great globe of water, we find that the luminary would be barely  one and a half times as heavy as the water. Of course, the actual mass  of the sun is very enormous; it is no less than 330,000 times as great  as that of the earth. The solar material itself is, however, relatively  light, so that the sun is four times as big as it would have to be if,  while its weight remained the same, its density equalled that of the  earth. Bearing in mind this lightness of the sun, and also the  exceedingly high temperature which we know to prevail there, no other  conclusion seems possible than that the body of the sun must be in a  gaseous state. The conditions under which such gases exist in the sun  are, no doubt, altogether different from those with which we are  acquainted on the earth. At the surface of the sun the force of gravity  is more than twenty-seven times as great as it is on the earth. A person  who on the earth could just lift twenty-seven equal pieces of metal  would, if he were transferred to the sun, only be able to lift one of  the pieces at a time. The pressure of the gases below the surface must  therefore be very great, and it might be supposed that they would become  liquefied in consequence. It was, however, discovered by Andrews that so  long as a gas is kept at a temperature higher than a certain point,  known as the \"critical temperature\" (which is different for different  gases), the gas will not be turned into a liquid however great be the  pressure to which it is submitted. The temperature on the sun cannot be  lower than the critical temperatures of the gases there existing; so it  would seem that even the enormous pressure can hardly reduce the gases  in the great luminary to the liquid form.    Of the interior of the sun we can, of course, expect to learn little or  nothing. What we observe is the surface-layer, the so-called  photosphere, in which the cold of space produces the condensation of the  gases into those luminous clouds which we see in our drawings and  photographs as \"rice grains\" or \"willow leaves.\" It has been suggested  by Dr. Johnstone Stoney (and afterwards by Professor Hastings, of  Baltimore) that these luminous clouds are mainly composed of carbon with  those of the related elements silicon and boron, the boiling points of  which are much higher than those of other elements which might be  considered likely to form the photospheric clouds. The low atomic weight  of carbon must also have the effect of giving the molecules of this  element a very high velocity, and thereby enabling them to work their  way into the upper regions, where the temperature has so fallen that the  vapour becomes chilled into cloud. A necessary consequence of the rapid  cooling of these clouds, and the consequent radiation of heat on a  large scale, would be the formation of what we may perhaps describe as  smoke, which settles by degrees through the intervals between the clouds  (making these intervals appear darker) until it is again volatilised on  reaching a level of greater heat below the clouds. This same smoke is  probably the cause of the well-known fact that the solar limb is  considerably fainter than the middle of the disc. This seems to arise  from the greater absorption caused by the longer distance which a ray of  light from a point near the limb has to travel through this layer of  smoke before reaching the earth. It is shown that this absorption cannot  be attributed to a gaseous atmosphere, since this would have the effect  of producing more dark absorption lines in the spectrum. There would  thus be a marked difference between the solar spectrum from a part near  the middle of the disc and the spectrum from a part near the limb. This,  however, we do not find to be the case.    With regard to the nature of sun-spots, the idea first suggested by  Secchi and Lockyer, that they represent down rushes of cooler vapours  into the photosphere (or to its surface), seems on the whole to accord  best with the observed phenomena. We have already mentioned that the  spots are generally accompanied by faculae and eruptive prominences in  their immediate neighbourhood, but whether these eruptions are caused by  the downfall of the vapour which makes the photospheric matter \"splash  up\" in the vicinity, or whether the eruptions come first, and by  diminishing the upward pressure from below form a \"sink,\" into which  overlying cooler vapour descends, are problems as to which opinions are  still much divided.    A remarkable appendage to the sun, which extends to a distance very much  greater than that of the corona, produces the phenomenon of the zodiacal  light. A pearly glow is sometimes seen in the spring to spread over a  part of the sky in the vicinity of the point where the sun has  disappeared after sunset. The same spectacle may also be witnessed  before sunrise in the autumn, and it would seem as if the material  producing the zodiacal light, whatever it may be, had a lens-shaped  form with the sun in the centre. The nature of this object is still a  matter of uncertainty, but it is probably composed of a kind of dust, as  the faint spectrum it affords is of a continuous type. A view of the  zodiacal light is shown in Fig. 22.    In all directions the sun pours forth, with the most prodigal  liberality, its torrents of light and of heat. The earth can only grasp  the merest fraction, less than the 2,000,000,000th part of the whole.  Our fellow planets and the moon also intercept a trifle; but how small  is the portion of the mighty flood which they can utilise! The sip that  a flying swallow takes from a river is as far from exhausting the water  in the river as are the planets from using all the heat which streams  from the sun.    The sun's gracious beams supply the magic power that enables the corn to  grow and ripen. It is the heat of the sun which raises water from the  ocean in the form of vapour, and then sends down that vapour as rain to  refresh the earth and to fill the rivers which bear our ships down to  the ocean. It is the heat of the sun beating on the large continents  which gives rise to the breezes and winds that waft our vessels across  the deep; and when on a winter's evening we draw around the fire and  feel its invigorating rays, we are only enjoying sunbeams which shone on  the earth countless ages ago. The heat in those ancient sunbeams  developed the mighty vegetation of the coal period, and in the form of  coal that heat has slumbered for millions of years, till we now call it  again into activity. It is the power of the sun stored up in coal that  urges on our steam-engines. It is the light of the sun stored up in coal  that beams from every gaslight in our cities.    For the power to live and move, for the plenty with which we are  surrounded, for the beauty with which nature is adorned, we are  immediately indebted to one body in the countless hosts of space, and  that body is the sun.

In the night from the 2nd to the 3rd October, about  ten o'clock, he came down into the plain and attacked Sommieres from two  different points, setting fire to the houses. The inhabitants seizing  their arms, made a sortie, but Cavalier charged them at the head of the  Cavalry and forced them to retreat. Thereupon the governor, whose  garrison was too small to leave the shelter of the walls, turned his  guns on them and fired, less in the hope of inflicting injury on them  than in that of being heard by the neighbouring garrisons.    The Camisards recognising this danger, retired, but not before they had  burnt down the hotels of the Cheval-Blanc, the Croix-d'Or, the  Grand-Louis, and the Luxembourg, as well as a great number of other  houses, and the church and the presbytery of Saint-Amand.    Thence the Camisards proceeded to Cayla and Vauvert, into which they  entered, destroying the fortifications. There they provided themselves  abundantly with provisions for man and beast. In Vauvert, which was  almost entirely inhabited by his co-religionists, Cavalier assembled the  inhabitants in the market-place, and made them join with him in prayer  to God, that He would prevent the king from following evil counsel; he  also exhorted his brethren to be ready to sacrifice their goods and  their lives for the re-establishment of their religion, affirming that  the Holy Spirit had revealed to him that the arm of the Lord, which had  always come to their aid, was still stretched out over them.    Cavalier undertook these movements in the hope of interrupting the work  of destruction going on in Upper Cevennes; and partly obtained the  desired result; for M. de Julien received orders to come down into the  open country and disperse the Camisards.    The troops tried to fulfil this task, but, thanks to the knowledge that  the rebels had of the country, it was impossible to come up with them,  so that Fleshier, who was in the thick of the executions,  conflagrations, and massacres, but who still found time to write Latin  verse and gallant letters, said, in speaking of them, \"They were never  caught, and did all the damage they wished to do without let or  hindrance. We laid their mountains waste, and they laid waste our plain.  There are no more churches left in our dioceses, and not being able  either to plough or sow our lands, we have no revenues. We dread serious  revolt, and desire to avoid a religious civil war; so all our efforts  are relaxing, we let our arms fall without knowing why, and we are told,  'You must have patience; it is not possible to fight against phantoms.'\"  Nevertheless, from time to time, these phantoms became visible. Towards  the end of October, Cavalier came down to Uzes, carried off two  sentinels who were guarding the gates, and hearing the call to arms  within, shouted that he would await the governor of the city, M. de  Vergetot, near Lussan.    And indeed Cavalier, accompanied by his two lieutenants, Ravanel and  Catinat, took his way towards this little town, between Uzes and  Bargeac, which stands upon an eminence surrounded upon all sides by  cliffs, which serve it as ramparts and render it very difficult of  access. Having arrived within three gun-shots of Lussan, Cavalier sent  Ravanel to demand provisions from the inhabitants; but they, proud of  their natural ramparts, and believing their town impregnable, not only  refused to comply with the requisition, but fired several shots on the  envoy, one of which wounded in the arm a Camisard of the name of La  Grandeur, who had accompanied Ravanel. Ravanel withdrew, supporting his  wounded comrade, followed by shots and the hootings of the inhabitants.  When they rejoined Cavalier and made their report, the young commander  issued orders to his soldiers to make ready to take the town the next  morning; for, as night was already falling, he did not venture to start  in the dark. In the meantime the besieged sent post-haste to M. de  Vergetot to warn him of their situation; and resolving to defend  themselves as long as they could, while waiting for a response to their  message they set about barricading their gates, turned their scythes  into weapons, fastened large hooks on long poles, and collected all the  instruments they could find that could be used in attack or defence. As  to the Camisards, they encamped for the night near an old chateau called  Fan, about a gun-shot from Lussan.    At break of day loud shouts from the town told the Camisards that the  expected relief was in sight, and looking out they saw in the distance a  troop of soldiers advancing towards them; it was M. de Vergetat at the  head of his regiment, accompanied by forty Irish officers.    The Protestants prepared themselves, as usual, by reciting psalms and  prayers, notice without taking of the shouts and threats of any of the  townspeople, and having finished their invocations, they marched out to  meet the approaching column. The cavalry, commanded by Catinat, made a  detour, taking a sheltered way to an unguarded bridge over a small river  not far off, so as to outflank the royal forces, which they were to  attack in the rear as soon as Cavalier and Ravanel should have engaged  them in front.    M de Vergetot, on his side, continued to advance, so that the Calvinists  and the Catholics were soon face to face. The battle began on both sides  by a volley; but Cavalier having seen his cavalry emerging from a  neighbouring wood, and counting upon their assistance, charged the enemy  at the double quick. Catinat judging by the noise of the firing that his  presence was necessary, charged also at a gallop, falling on the flank  of the Catholics.    In this charge, one of M. de Vergetot's captains was killed by a bullet,  and the other by a sabre-cut, and the grenadiers falling into disorder,  first lost ground and then fled, pursued by Catinat and his horsemen,  who, seizing them by the hair, despatched them with their swords. Having  tried in vain to rally his men, M. de Vergetot, surrounded by a few  Irish, was forced in his turn to fly; he was hotly pursued, and on the  point of being taken, when by good luck he reached the height of Gamene,  with its walls of rock. Jumping off his horse, he entered the narrow  pathway which led to the top, and entrenched himself with about a  hundred men in this natural fort. Cavalier perceiving that further  pursuit would be dangerous, resolved to rest satisfied with his victory;  as he knew by his own experience that neither men nor horses had eaten  for eighteen hours, he gave the signal far retreat, and retired on  Seyne, where he hoped to find provisions.    This defeat mortified the royal forces very deeply, and they resolved to  take their revenge. Having learnt by their spies that on a certain night  in November Cavalier and his band intended to sleep on a mountain called  Nages, they surrounded the mountain during the night, so that at dawn  Cavalier found himself shut in on every side. As he wished to see with  his own eyes if the investment was complete, he ordered his troops to  fall into rank on the top of the mountain, giving the command to Ravanel  and Catinat, and with a pair of pistols in his belt and his carbine on  his shoulder, he glided from bush to bush and rock to rock, determined,  if any weak spot existed, to discover it; but the information he had  received was perfectly correct, every issue was guarded.    Cavalier now set off to rejoin his troops, passing through a ravine, but  he had hardly taken thirty steps when he found himself confronted by a  cornet and two dragoons who were lying in ambush. There was no time to  run away, and indeed such a thought never entered the young commander's  head; he walked straight up to them. On their side, the dragoons  advanced towards him, and the cornet covering him with his pistol,  called out, \"Halt! you are Cavalier; I know you. It is not possible for  you to escape; surrender at discretion.\" Cavalier's answer was to blow  out the cornet's brains with a shot from his carbine, then throwing it  behind him as of no further use, he drew his two pistols from his belt,  walked up to the two dragoons, shot them both dead, and rejoined his  comrades unwounded. These, who had believed him lost, welcomed him with  cheers.    But Cavalier had something else to do than to celebrate his return;  mounting his horse, he put himself at the head of his men, and fell upon  the royal troops with such impetuosity that they gave way at the first  onset. Then a strange incident occurred. About thirty women who had come  to the camp with provisions, carried away by their enthusiasm at the  sight of this success, threw themselves upon the enemy, fighting like  men. One young girl of about seventeen, Lucrese Guigon by name,  distinguished herself amongst the others by her great valour. Not  content with encouraging her brethren by the cry of \"The sword of the  Lord and of Gideon!\" she tore sabres from the hands of the dead dragoons  to despatch the dying. Catinat, followed by ten of his men, pursued the  flying troops as far as the plain of Calvisson. There they were able to  rally, thanks to the advance of the garrison to meet them.    Eighty dragoons lay dead on the field of battle, while Cavalier had only  lost five men.    As we shall see, Cavalier was not only a brave soldier and a skilful  captain, but also a just judge. A few days after the deed of arms which  we have just related, he learned that a horrible murder had been  committed by four Camisards, who had then retired into the forest of  Bouquet. He sent a detachment of twenty men with orders to arrest the  murderers and bring them before him. The following are the details of  the "]]]
