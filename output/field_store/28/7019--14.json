[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#14)"],[1," approves, and the custom grows.    Entertaining at one's club is governed by the rules of that particular  club.  When entertaining at tea rooms, or _cafes_, one has simply to  arrange with the superintendent or the head waiter, for tables or  private dining-room, for the date chosen; to choose the _menu_, and  order the decorations.  This done, the entertainers and their friends  have but to appear at the stated hour and play their respective roles  with care-free grace.  These dinners may be given by a bachelor, to a  mixed company, or to a bevy of the debutantes, with the co-operation of  a society matron or a married couple to chaperone the affair.  This is  a very pleasant way for a bachelor to make return for the social  attentions showered on himself.    This way of entertaining may be lavishly expensive, but it is not  necessarily so; all things considered, it may not greatly exceed the  cost of similar entertaining at home.  In this land of the free, any  one who will may give a tea room luncheon.  But the semi-publicity of  these functions invites criticism; and people of moderate income  discreetly forbear attempting anything too ambitious for their obvious  means.  Elegant simplicity is always good form.      The universal use of the telephone is another factor in the  modification of social customs.  Among familiar friends, the little  chat over the 'phone largely takes the place of the informal call.  Also, invitations to any but strictly formal functions are now sent by  telephone, if agreeable to both parties; though it is still considered  better to adhere to the more respectful written form if there is any  doubt about the new way being acceptable to the party of the second  part.  While I counsel conservatism in these changes, I am convinced  that the new dynasty of wire and wireless is destined to dominate us;  and as discovery continues and inventions multiply, the time is near  when _immediate communication_ will be had at long range; possibly  telepathy--who knows?  Or, possibly tele-photography with it--why not?  Then, the slow, laborious writing of messages will be as much out of  date as the super-annuated stage-coach.    But--not yet; we are still in the process of evolution.  It is still  safe to heed Pope's famous advice:      \"Be not the first by whom the new is tried,    Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.\"          \"THE STRANGER THAT IS WITHIN THY GATES\"    It is the duty of the host or hostess to give a polite and cheerful  welcome to the guest whom they have invited to cross their threshold.  During the time that she remains under their roof they have the  responsibility of making her comfortable, and as happy as possible.  To  do this, attention to details is of the greatest consequence.  It is  possible to give dinners, and _musicales_, and receptions for a guest,  and to introduce her to a choice circle of friends; to plan drives and  excursions for sight-seeing to points of interest; to bring out the  best preserves from the store-room, and put on the table all the  delicacies of the season; and yet something may be lacking.  A subtle  expression of discomfort may at times cloud the face of the guest, and  greatly disturb the anxious hostess, who redoubles her efforts to think  of something else in the way of entertainment and diversion.  If this  well-meaning hostess will accompany me to the guest-room while its  temporary occupant is reading on the \"front porch,\" perhaps I can point  out to her some things that will give a clue to the mystery.    The guest-room is large and airy, and \"well-furnished,\" as the phrase  goes, with a soft carpet prevailingly blue, and a prettily carved oaken  \"set.\"  The bed is covered with a lace counterpane over a blue silk  quilt, and downy pillows invite to slumber.  Curtains of blue silk and  white lace are draped at the windows; cushions, tidies, sachets,  gim-cracks of every description load the bureau, and lie around in  profusion; a pretty rug of fluffy fur is spread before a comfortable  couch, and a rocking-chair and foot-stool are in the cozy window  recess.  A small table with a vase of flowers upon it occupies one  space against the wall.  The wash-stand bears the regulation \"toilet  set,\" bowl and pitcher, soap-dish, etc., with the china jar set in the  corner.  Plenty of damask towels hang on the rack, and the \"splasher\"  is a marvel of needlework.  Well, is not this a pretty comfortable room?    It seems ungracious to answer nay; but truth compels me to say that it  proves to be a most _un_comfortable room, as managed.  Since the guest  arrived, this three-quart pitcher has been filled each morning with  cold water.  Beyond this, no offer of the aqueous element in any form  has been made.  The guest, accustomed at home to an abundance of hot  water, and the luxury of a bath daily--or oftener, at will--has been  suffering the greatest privation rather than trouble her hostess with a  request for something which is so evidently not thought of in this  house.  With soap that \"chaps,\" and a stiff nail-brush she has  painfully scrubbed her cold knuckles to remove the grime which several  days of imperfect ablution has rendered almost immovable--except as the  skin comes with it.  And as to her customary bath, she has substituted  so much of hasty sponging as chattering teeth will allow, finishing off  with a dry polish when prudence forbids further risk of a chill; and  she has completed her toilet with a sense of self-disgust, and a  dissatisfaction with her surroundings which makes her long for the day  set for the termination if this visit, which might have been so  pleasant, if she had been made physically comfortable.  When she goes  home she will answer, to the kind inquiries of her mother: \"Oh! yes; I  had a lovely time!--or that is, I should have had, if only I could have  had a _bath_!\"    Whether it is that some people do not care for bathing, and therefore  do not realize its necessity to the comfort of other people; or whether  they have an idea that a \"guest\" is a being who, while in that _role_,  needs none of the ordinary comforts of every-day life; or, whatever the  reason may be, this failure to provide bath facilities is one of the  most common and flagrant neglects of hospitality.    When the guest-room has no private bath attached, and it is  impracticable to offer the use of the family bath-room, a small tub of  zinc or granite ware should be included in the furnishing of the  guest-room, together with a square of thin oil-cloth to spread on the  carpet.  The guest should be informed that hot water is always in  readiness to be brought to her room whenever she requires it.  In  country houses having no \"modern conveniences,\" every kitchen stove may  have an ample boiler always filled with clean water, so that at all  times hot water may be available for bathing purposes.  It is  unpardonable to live without at least this much provision for an  essential condition of civilized life--\"the cleanliness that is next to  godliness.\"    In addition to the water supply, the guest-room should contain other  requisites for a comfortable toilet.  Presumably, every guest who comes  for a several-days' stay brings with her the small articles she will  need; but oversights are frequent in hurried packing, and the resources  of the guest-room should be equal to any such emergency, even though  only a part of the provision is required in any one case.  A neat,  close cabinet, with a closet beneath and shelves above, is a desirable  piece of furniture.  In the closet the bath-tub can be stored, and  bath-brushes, \"loofahs,\" and sponges can be hung up while the shelves  may hold a supply of toilet sundries; for example, a flask of bay rum,  and one of violet-water; a bottle of spirits of ammonia, a bottle of  alcohol, a spirit lamp and curling tongs, tooth-powder, rosewater, and  glycerine; a jar of fine cold-cream, hair-brush and combs, a  clothes-brush, a whisk broom, a reserve supply of soap--\"Ivory\" (if the  water is hard, this soap is superior for the bath) and fine castile,  and a delicately-scented soap of first quality.  The cheap \"scented\"  abominations should not be inflicted on a guest.    The dressing-table should have a supply of pins in variety, including  hairpins; a work-box, containing needles and thread, a thimble,  scissors, tape, shoe-buttons, etc.  A bottle of cologne and also of  some first-class \"triple extract\" should stand on the bureau.    With all this provided, one is not likely to lack any comfort for the  toilet; yet, with it all, the hostess should make her guest understand  that the motto is: \"If you don't see what you want, ask for it.\"  This  freedom will not be taken by a sensitive guest unless it is clearly  invited.  The self-complacent way in which a hostess sometimes ushers a  guest into the \"best room,\" and then leaves her to the mercy of what  she can find--or, rather, _cannot_ find--forestalls all requests for  additional supplies.  In the midst of all the satin and lace flummery,  it is pathetic to suffer in silence for the lack of a little beggarly  hot water.  And yet, such is the experience of many an \"honored guest.\"    Beside the toilet comforts, there are other things that may well be  added to the equipment of the guest-room.  One, in particular, is a  well-appointed little writing-desk, containing all the requisites for  letter-writing, including stamps.  Perhaps the guest has brought these  things with her, more likely she has forgotten them, and it may be a  matter of great convenience to her to find this little desk awaiting  her.  If there is a shelf above, a selection of standard and  entertaining books may be placed thereon.  The Bible, a book of Common  Prayer, a hymnal, may be included; a copy of Shakespeare, a dictionary,  some clever and interesting book, like _Curious Questions_, and a  volume or two of sketches and essays, ranging in style from Emerson to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#14)"],[1," put in Jessica.  \"You who are always giving other people treats.\"    \"Wait until you hear the plan, child, before you pass judgment,\"  answered Mrs. Gray. \"It's been too many years to count since I have had  a really, jolly Christmas,\" she continued. \"I have just sat here in this  quiet old house, and let the holidays roll over me without even noticing  them.\"    \"Now, Mrs. Gray,\" exclaimed Grace, \"the poor people in Oakdale would not  agree with you on that point. Only last Christmas I saw your carriage  stopping in front of the Flower Mission, and it was simply bursting with  presents.\"    \"Yes, yes, my dear. It is the easiest thing in the world to give  presents and not so much pleasure after all. What I want is some actual  fun, good Christmas cheer and plenty of young people. But I shall have  to be selfish if I'm to get it all, because it will mean that I'm to rob  mothers and fathers for a whole week of their children. Mr. and Mrs.  Harlowe will have to learn to do without you, Grace, for seven days and  nights. Your father, Jessica, must keep his own house. Nora, your  brothers and sister must not expect to see you at all while you belong  to me. As for my precious Anne, here, I should just like to steal her  away altogether from her mother. In fact, my dears, I am going to adopt  you for a whole week during the holidays and then--such larks!\"    And the charming old lady looked so gay and pretty that the girls all  laughed joyously.    \"Do you mean that you really want us to make you a visit, Mrs. Gray?\"    \"I do indeed. That is the exceedingly selfish wish I have been  entertaining for the last six weeks. I not only want it, but I have  arranged for it already. I have made secret calls, my dears, and mothers  and fathers, brothers and sisters are all most agreeable. You are to  come to me a week before Christmas and must settle yourselves exactly as  if you were my own children. I mean to punish any homesick girl severely  by giving her an overdose of chocolate drops. Families may be visited  once a day, if necessary, though I shall frown down upon too frequent  absences. But, young ladies, before we get any further, tell me what you  think of the plan?\"    The girls were almost speechless with amazement and pleasure. To visit  Mrs. Gray's beautiful home and live in a whirl of parties and funmaking  such as would be sure to follow was more than any of them had ever  dreamed of.    \"It's perfectly delightful, Mrs. Gray!\" they cried almost in one breath.    \"And we shall give the Christmas party together, my four daughters and  I, and we'll do exactly as we choose and invite whom we please.\"    \"Oh, oh!\" exclaimed the four young girls. \"Won't it be fun?\"    \"It will for me,\" said the little old lady. \"And I need to have a good  time. I am getting old before my time for lack of amusement. And now, my  lady-birds, who else shall we invite to the house party?\"    \"Who else?\" said Grace, somewhat crestfallen; for four intimate girl  chums are invariably jealous of admitting other girls to the charmed  circle.    \"Do you mean what other girls, Mrs. Gray?\" asked Jessica.    \"No, no, child; I mean what other boys, of course. Do you think I want  any more than my four nice freshmen to amuse me? But I don't think this  party would be complete without four fine fellows to look after us. Who  are the four nicest boys you know?\"    \"David,\" exclaimed all four voices in unison.    Mrs. Gray laughed.    \"There seems to be no difference of opinion on that score,\" she replied;  \"but is David the only boy in Oakdale?\"    \"He's the nicest one,\" said Anne, who could never forget how kind David  had been to her when his sister was her bitter enemy.    \"Reddy Brooks is nice, too,\" said Nora. \"He threw apples at some tramps  once, and saved us from being robbed.\"    \"Very good,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"Reddy Brooks shall certainly be invited to  the house party. I admire courage above all things.\"    \"Then there's 'Hippopotamus' Wingate,\" said Jessica.    \"Who?\" demanded Mrs. Gray.    \"His name is really 'Theophilus', but the boys have always called him  'Hippopotamus,' and now the name sticks to him and everybody forgets he  has any other.\"    \"Are you agreed on Hippopotamus, my adopted daughters?\" demanded Mrs.  Gray.    It was voted by acclamation, that Hippopotamus was agreeable to the  company.    \"And now, I have a fourth to propose,\" announced Mrs. Gray. \"I think I  should like to import my great-nephew, Tom Gray, from New York. He is a  little older than these boys, perhaps. Nineteen is his age, I think, and  I haven't seen him since he was a child; but he's obliged to be nice  because he bears the name of one beloved by all who knew him.\"    \"Whose name, Mrs. Gray?\" asked Nora.    \"That of my husband,\" said the old lady, softly. \"The nicest Tom Gray  this world has ever known.\" And she looked at a portrait over the  sideboard of a very handsome young man dressed in the uniform of an Army  officer.    \"He loved his country, my dears, and fought for it nobly. He was a  soldier and a gentleman,\" went on the old lady proudly, \"and I am sorry  he left no son to follow in his footsteps. He was a great hunter and  traveler, too. I used to tell him if he had not loved his family so  dearly, he would certainly have been a gypsy. He liked camping and  tramping, and used to wander off in Upton Woods for hours at a time. He  knew the names of all the trees and birds and animals that exist, I  believe. But he loved his home, too, and no woods had the power to draw  him away from it for long. I used to tell him he had brought a piece of  the forest and put it in our front yard, for he planted all those  beautiful trees you now see growing on my lawn, which my old gardener,  who has been with me since I was first married, cherishes as he would  his own children.\"    \"And is young Tom Gray like him, Mrs. Gray?\" interposed Grace.    \"I hope so, my dear,\" sighed the old lady. \"If he has inherited the  beautiful traits of his uncle, his wholesome tastes for the outdoors and  nature, he can't help being a fine fellow. But I have not seen my nephew  since he was a child. He has been living here and there all these years,  sometimes in America and sometimes in England. His mother and father are  both dead, and he has been brought up by his mother's unmarried sisters,  who are half English themselves. But he must be a nice boy, even if he  has only one drop of his uncle's blood in his veins.\"    The girls sighed and said nothing. It was touching and beautiful to see  the old lady's loyalty and devotion after all these years of loneliness;  for her husband had been dead since she was a young woman. Still Mrs.  Gray never brooded. She was always cheerful and happy in doing  kindnesses for other people.    \"If ever I marry,\" sentimental Jessica was thinking, \"I hope it will be  somebody like Mrs. Gray's husband.\"    \"I should like to have a brother like Tom Gray,\" observed Grace aloud.    \"Well,\" said Mrs. Gray, \"we shall have to wait and see what the new Tom  Gray is like. He may be utterly unlike _my_ Tom Gray.\"    And the old lady sighed.    \"We shall all have to get new party dresses,\" exclaimed Nora to change  the subject. \"I have been wanting one for an age and now I have a good  excuse.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" cried Grace enthusiastically. \"Now, at last, I shall be able  to get the blue silk mother promised I could have if at any time there  was an occasion worthy of it.\"    \"I'm going to ask papa to give me a lavender crepe for a Christmas  present,\" said Jessica.    \"O Mrs. Gray,\" continued Nora, \"we are going to have such fun Oakdale  can't hold us.\"    \"I think we should have a surprise for Mrs. Gray,\" announced Grace. \"She  is doing so much for us. O girls! I have an idea.\"    \"What!\" demanded the others breathlessly, including Mrs. Gray herself,  who was as full of curiosity as a young girl.    \"No, no,\" cried Grace, \"it wouldn't be a surprise if I gave it away. But  it's going to require a lot of work and planning to carry it out.\"    \"Is it big or little?\" asked the dainty old lady as eager as a child to  find out the secret.    \"It's rather small,\" answered Grace.    \"Fine or superfine?\"    \"Both,\" laughed Grace. \"But you'll not know till Christmas night; so  stifle your curiosity.\"    \"I suppose I must wait, but it's going to be very hard,\" replied Mrs.  Gray plaintively.    And so the party was arranged. Notes, written by Anne, were dispatched  to the four boys; plans were discussed for the week's amusements, and  the four girls finally started home in a state of great excitement to  look over their wardrobes and furbish up their party dresses.    Only Anne had looked somewhat dubious during the conversation. How could  she spend a week in a beautiful house, with parties every night and  company all the time, and nothing to wear but that hideous black silk?    \"Anne,\" called Mrs. Gray, as the young girl was about to close the front  door and follow the others down the steps. \"Wait a moment. I want to see  you.\" She led Anne into the big drawing room. \"Do you know that I am  greatly in your debt, my child?\" continued the old lady, as she drew  Anne down beside her on the sofa. \"I don't think I could ever possibly  repay you for the good you have done me this autumn. But I am going to  try, nevertheless, by making you a Christmas present before Christmas  arrives. Now, when I was your age, I preferred clothes to other things.  I think all young girls do; or, if they don't they are most unnatural.  Therefore, child, I have decided to pay off some of my indebtedness to  you by getting my dressmaker to make you some dresses, if it is  agreeable to you. Why, what is this! My little girl crying?\"    The tears were streaming down Anne's cheeks.    \"You mustn't cry, my own child,\" sobbed Mrs. Gray. \"For I always cry  when I see other people doing it, and it's very bad for my old eyes, you  know.\"    \"You are so good to me!\" said Anne. \"It makes "]]]
