CHAPTER VI.         _Galileo loses his favourite Daughter--He falls into a state of       melancholy and ill health--Is allowed to go to Florence for its       recovery in 1638--But is prevented from leaving his House or       receiving his Friends--His friend Castelli permitted to visit him       in the presence of an Officer of the Inquisition--He composes his       celebrated Dialogues on Local Motion--Discovers the Moon's       Libration--Loses the sight of one Eye--The other Eye attacked by       the same Disease--Is struck blind--Negociates with the Dutch       Government respecting his Method of finding the Longitude--He is       allowed free intercourse with his Friends--His Illness and Death in       1642--His Epitaph--His Social, Moral, and Scientific Character._      Although Galileo had now the happiness of rejoining his family under  their paternal roof, yet, like all sublunary blessings, it was but of  short duration. His favourite daughter Maria, who along with her sister  had joined the convent of St Matthew in the neighbourhood of Arcetri,  had looked forward to the arrival of her father with the most  affectionate anticipations. She hoped that her filial devotion might  form some compensation for the malignity of his enemies, and she eagerly  assumed the labour of reciting weekly the seven penitentiary psalms  which formed part of her father's sentence. These sacred duties,  however, were destined to terminate almost at the moment they were  begun. She was seized with a fatal illness in the same month in which  she rejoined her parent, and before the month of April she was no more.  This heavy blow, so suddenly struck, overwhelmed Galileo in the deepest  agony. Owing to the decline of his health, and the recurrence of his old  complaints, he was unable to oppose to this mental suffering the  constitutional energy of his mind. The bulwarks of his heart broke down,  and a flood of grief desolated his manly and powerful mind. He felt, as  he expressed it, that he was incessantly called by his daughter--his  pulse intermitted--his heart was agitated with unceasing  palpitations--his appetite entirely left him, and he considered his  dissolution so near at hand, that he would not permit his son Vicenzo to  set out upon a journey which he had contemplated.    From this state of melancholy and indisposition, Galileo slowly, though  partially, recovered, and, with the view of obtaining medical  assistance, he requested leave to go to Florence. His enemies, however,  refused this application, and he was given to understand that any  additional importunities would be visited with a more vigilant  surveillance. He remained, therefore, five years at Arcetri, from 1634  to 1638, without any remission of his confinement, and pursuing his  studies under the influence of a continued and general indisposition.    There is no reason to think that Galileo or his friends renewed their  application to the Church of Rome; but, in 1638, the Pope transmitted,  through the Inquisitor Fariano, his permission that he might remove to  Florence for the recovery of his health, on the condition that he should  present himself at the office of the Inquisitor to learn the terms upon  which this indulgence was granted. Galileo accepted of the kindness thus  unexpectedly proffered. But the conditions upon which it was given were  more severe than he expected. He was prohibited from leaving his house  or admitting his friends; and so sternly was this system pursued, that  he required a special order for attending mass during passion week.    The severity of this order was keenly felt by Galileo. While he remained  at Arcetri, his seclusion from the world would have been an object of  choice, if it had not been the decree of a tribunal; but to be debarred  from the conversation of his friends in Florence--in that city where his  genius had been idolised, and where his fame had become immortal, was an  aggravation of punishment which he was unable to bear. With his  accustomed kindness, the Grand Duke made a strong representation on the  subject to his ambassador at the Court of Rome. He stated that, from his  great age and infirmities, Galileo's career was near its close; that he  possessed many valuable ideas, which the world might lose if they were  not matured and conveyed to his friends; and that Galileo was anxious to  make these communications to Father Castelli, who was then a stipendiary  of the Court of Rome. The Grand Duke commanded his ambassador to see  Castelli on the subject--to urge him to obtain leave from the Pope to  spend a few months in Florence--and to supply him with money and every  thing that was necessary for his journey. Influenced by this kind and  liberal message, Castelli obtained an audience of the Pope, and  requested leave to pay a visit to Florence. Urban instantly suspected  the object of his journey; and, upon Castelli's acknowledging that he  could not possibly refrain from seeing Galileo, he received permission  to visit him in the company of an officer of the Inquisition. Castelli  accordingly went to Florence, and, a few months afterwards, Galileo was  ordered to return to Arcetri.    During Galileo's confinement at Sienna and Arcetri, between 1633 and  1638, his time was principally occupied in the composition of his  \"Dialogues on Local Motion,\" in which he treats of the strength and  cohesion of solid bodies, of the laws of uniform and accelerated  motions, of the motion of projectiles, and of the centre of gravity of  solids. This remarkable work, which was considered by its author as the  best of his productions, was printed by Louis Elzevir, at Amsterdam, and  dedicated to the Count de Noailles, the French ambassador at Rome.  Various attempts to have it printed in Germany had failed; and, in order  to save himself from the malignity of his enemies, he was obliged to  pretend that the edition published in Holland had been printed from a  MS. entrusted to the French ambassador.    Although Galileo had for a long time abandoned his astronomical studies,  yet his attention was directed, about the year 1636, to a curious  appearance in the lunar disc, which is known by the name of the moon's  libration. When we examine with a telescope the outline of the moon, we  observe that certain parts of her disc, which are seen at one time, are  invisible at another. This change or libration is of four different  kinds, viz. the diurnal libration, the libration in longitude, the  libration in latitude, and the spheroidal libration. Galileo discovered  the first of these kinds of libration, and appears to have had some  knowledge of the second; but the third was discovered by Hevelius, and  the fourth by Lagrange.    This curious discovery was the result of the last telescopic  observations of Galileo. Although his right eye had for some years lost  its power, yet his general vision was sufficiently perfect to enable him  to carry on his usual researches. In 1636, however, this affection of  his eye became more serious; and, in 1637, his left eye was attacked  with the same disease. His medical friends at first supposed that  cataracts were formed in the crystalline lens, and anticipated a cure  from the operation of couching. These hopes were fallacious. The disease  turned out to be in the cornea, and every attempt to restore its  transparency was fruitless. In a few months the white cloud covered the  whole aperture of the pupil, and Galileo became totally blind. This  sudden and unexpected calamity had almost overwhelmed Galileo and his  friends. In writing to a correspondent he exclaims, \"Alas! your dear  friend and servant has become totally and irreparably blind. These  heavens, this earth, this universe, which by wonderful observation I had  enlarged a thousand times beyond the belief of past ages, are henceforth  shrunk into the narrow space which I myself occupy. So it pleases God;  it shall, therefore, please me also.\" His friend, Father Castelli,  deplores the calamity in the same tone of pathetic sublimity:--\"The  noblest eye,\" says he, \"which nature ever made, is darkened; an eye so  privileged, and gifted with such rare powers, that it may truly be said  to have seen more than the eyes of all that are gone, and to have  opened the eyes of all that are to come.\"    Although Galileo had been thwarted in his attempt to introduce into the  Spanish marine his new method of finding the longitude at sea, yet he  never lost sight of an object to which he attached the highest  importance. As the formation of correct tables of the motion of  Jupiter's satellites was a necessary preliminary to its introduction, he  had occupied himself for twenty-four years in observations for this  purpose, and he had made considerable progress in this laborious task.  After the publication of his \"Dialogues on Motion,\" in 1636, he renewed  his attempts to bring his method into actual use. For this purpose he  addressed himself to Lorenzo Real, who had been the Dutch  Governor-General in India, and offered the free use of his method to the  States-General of Holland.[36] The Dutch government received this  proposal with an anxious desire to have it carried into effect. At the  instigation of Constantine Huygens, the father of the illustrious  Huygens, and the secretary to the Prince of Orange, they appointed  commissioners to communicate with Galileo; and while they transmitted  him a gold chain as a mark of their esteem, they at the same time  assured him, that if his plan should prove successful it should not pass  unrewarded. The commissioners entered into an active correspondence with  Galileo, and had even appointed one of their number to communicate  personally with him in Italy. Lest this, however, should excite the  jealousy of the court of Rome, Galileo objected to the arrangement, so  that the negociation was carried on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26014"],[0,"Practical Taxidermy (#14)"],[1,"ow. See Fig. 21.    Fig. 21--Stuffing Iron    This, I would point out to the non-professional reader, is a much more  satisfactory way of getting thoroughly efficient tools than going to  the expense of ordering a box of \"bird-stuffing implements,\" at a cost  of many pounds and finding one half of them unnecessary, and the other  half worthless.    CHAPTER IV.    PRESERVATIVE SOAPS, POWDERS, ETC.    HAVING skinned a zoological specimen, we require, as a matter of  course, to anoint the inside of the skin with some preservative, for  the purpose of arresting decomposition and general decay, and also  defending it from the ravages of insects for an indefinite period.  Many things will partially cure a skin; for instance, rubbing it with  dry earth and exposing it to the sun, as I have done with some success  when hunting abroad; chalk also will do, if nothing else can be  procured. I have at the present moment a raven's head cut off by a  rifle ball, cured only with chalk, and which is now, after a lapse of  twenty years, in as good a state of preservation as need be. Still we  require other aids than sun and chalk to properly preserve our  specimens, especially in our usually cold, damp climate; and if we ask  what is the sine qua non, a chorus of professional and amateur  taxidermists shout out, \"Arsenic, of course.\"    I propose to show the fallacy of this, being quite of the way of  thinking of Waterton, who says, \"It (arsenic) is dangerous to the  operator and inefficient as a preservative.\" I will, however, give  everyone a chance of doing exactly as he pleases by jotting down three  different recipes for arsenical soaps. The inventor of the first of  these appears to have been one Becoeur, of the now world-renowned  Metz. Becoeur appears to have flourished about the year 1770, and his  formula is still commonly used. It is compounded as follows:    No. 1.--Becoeur's Arsenical Soap.    Camphor,                         5 oz.    Salt of tartar,                     12 oz.    Powdered arsenic,                 2 lb.    Lime in powder (or powdered chalk),     4 oz.    White soap,                     2 lb.    Cut the soap into small slices as thin as possible, put them into a  pot over a gentle fire with very little water, stirring it often with  a wooden spoon; when dissolved, add the salts of tartar and powdered  chalk; take it off the fire, add the arsenic, and stir the whole  gently; lastly, put in the camphor, which must first be pounded in a  mortar with a little spirits of wine. When the whole is properly mixed  together it will have the consistence of paste. It may be preserved in  tin or earthenware pots, well closed and cautiously labelled. When  wanted for use it must be diluted with a little cold water to the  consistence of clear broth; the pot may be covered with a lid of  pasteboard, having a hole for the passage of the brush, by which the  liquor is applied. (There appears in this formula to be an error in  giving 12 oz. of Salts of tartar, which should, I think, be reduced to  2 oz.; also the proportion, of arsenic and soap is clearly excessive  with regard to the quantity of the lime or chalk.)    Swainson appears to have used a composition somewhat different from  the preceding. He describes it as follows:    No. 2.--Swainson's Arsenical Soap.    Arsenic,             1 oz.    Distilled water,         6 drms.    White soap,         1 oz    Camphor,             2 drms.    Carbonate of potash,     1 drm.    This mixture should be kept in small tin boxes; when it is to be used  moisten a camel-hair pencil with any kind of spirituous liquor, and  with it make a lather from the soap, which is to be applied to the  inner surface of all parts of the skin, and also to such bones as may  not be removed.    The next formula is of my own arrangement; I have used it, and have  found it quite equal to any of the other arsenical preparations, which  is not saying much for any of them.    No. 3.--Browne's Arsenical Soap.    Arsenic,                     1 lb    Distilled water                 6 drms    Soft soap,                     2 lb.    Whiting (or powdered chalk),         3 lb.    Camphor or tincture of musk,         2 oz.    Place the arsenic in an old saucepan (which is not to be used for any  other purpose whatever); put the whiting over it, next pour sufficient  water over it to make it into a thick paste, then add the soft soap,  stir the whole well together, add a little water, and place on the  fire to boil, adding from time to time water sufficient to render the  whole mass of the consistence of gruel. When it boils up it is  sufficiently well done; take it off the fire, and place outside in the  open air to cool, as the fumes, if given off in a close room, are  highly prejudicial to health. When nearly cold, stir in the camphor,  previously pounded to a fine powder by the addition of a few drops of  any spirit--spirits of wine, gin, rum, turpentine, etc. If musk is used  it is sufficient to stir it in the mass, or 1 oz. of pure carbolic  acid (previously melted) may be substituted for either the camphor or  musk.    The reason for stirring in the camphor, musk, or carbolic acid, when  the arsenical paste is nearly cold, is twofold--first, to prevent the  inhaling of the metallic fumes, which readily attack the lungs; and  secondly, to prevent the said fumes or heated air carrying off with it  the volatile essences of those drugs. The quantities given are  sufficient to fill two six-pound Australian meat tins, which form  capital receptacles for arsenical paste, and should be soldered up,  only to be opened as required for use. As this quantity is, however,  perhaps too much for the amateur, the proportions may be decreased,  and what is not in actual use had better be soldered up in the tins  just referred to, and which may be found very useful, besides, for  such purposes as paint pots, etc. Carefully label this preparation  \"Poison,\" and place it out of the reach of children.    I have given the foregoing formulae, not because I have the slightest  faith in any of them, but simply for the benefit, or otherwise, of  those persons who elect to use arsenical preparations in defiance of  the teachings of common sense, and in deference to the prevailing  notion that arsenic is the only poison extant which has extraordinary  preservative powers. This I flatly deny, after an experience of more  than five and twenty years. Let us dissect the evidence as to the  claim of arsenic to be considered as the antiseptic and preservative  agent par excellence.    Its advocates claim for it--First, that it dries and preserves all  flesh from decay better than anything else known; secondly, that if  the skin is well painted with arsenical soap no moth or maggot will be  found to touch it. This, then, is all is wanted--immunity from decay  and protection from insects. Now I maintain that arsenical mixtures  are not only most dangerous, but quite useless also for the purpose.    Arsenic is simply a drier of animal tissue to a certain extent, but so  are hundreds of other agents not so dangerous. It is also perfectly  useless as a scarecrow or poison to those betes noire of the  taxidermist, the larvae of the various clothes and fur eating moths of  the genus Tinea, or the larvae of Dermestes lardarius, murinus, and  other museum beetles. They simply laugh arsenic to scorn; indeed, I  believe, like the Styrian arsenic eaters, they fatten on it. I could  give many instances. Of course, when you point out to a brother  taxidermist--rival, I mean; there are no brothers in art--the fact  that somehow this arsenical paste does not work the wonders claimed  for it, he replies, \"Oh! ah! yes! that specimen, I now recollect, was  done by a very careless man I employed; he never half painted the  skin.\"    All nonsense! Men, as well as masters, lay the \"preservative\" on as  thickly as they can. Verbum sap.! A great outcry is being made at the  present day as to arsenical wall papers and ladies' dresses--very  properly so; but did it never strike any taxidermist--they must read  the papers some times, even if not scientific men--that if it was  dangerous to live in a room, the paper of which contains a barely  appreciable quantity of arsenic, it was also dangerous to work all day  in a shop amid hundreds of specimens actually reeking with arsenic,  and giving it off when dry, and when handled, in the form of dust?  Painted on the skin while wet is bad enough; but what shall we say to  those--well, we will not use harsh terms--who calmly tell you that  they always use dry arsenic. Incredible as the statement may appear to  the scientist, yet it is true that I have seen a man plunge his hand  in the most matter-of-fact way into a box containing dry arsenic, and  coolly proceed to dust it on a skin. What is the consequence of this  to the user of wet or dry arsenical preparations? Coughs, colds,  chronic bronchitis, soreness of the lips and nose, ugly ulcers,  brittleness of nails, and partial or complete paralysis. I knew a man  who formerly used dry arsenic, whose constitution was thoroughly  broken up by it. Again, an amateur of long standing called on me some  time since, paralyzed in one hand--the doctors could make nothing of  him. I said at once, \"You have been using quantities of arsenic, and  probably dry?\"    Much astonished, he said \"Yes;\" and he had never mentioned this fact  to his numerous doctors, who worked, of course, in the dark, when, by  a course of antidotes taken at first, he might have been saved.    Used alone, arsenical paste is worse than useless for animals, causing  them to \"sweat\" at once in certain places, and preventing your pulling  them about, as you must do if modelling; again, if used for fur, you  seldom or never can relax by that crucial test of a good preservative,  i.e,--plunging in water.    Yet one question to the advocates of arsenic. If it possesses the  chief advantage claimed for it, "]]]
