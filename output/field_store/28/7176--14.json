So far as we can tell, no agent is  likely to interfere with the gradual evolution caused by the tides,  which dynamical principles have disclosed to us. As the years roll on,  or perhaps, I should rather say, as thousands of years and millions of  years roll on, the day will continue to elongate, or the earth to  rotate more slowly on its axis. But countless ages must elapse before  another critical stage of the history shall be reached. It is needless  for me to ponder over the tedious process by which this interesting  epoch is reached. I shall rather sketch what the actual condition of  our system will be when that moment shall have arrived. The day will  then have expanded from the present familiar twenty-four hours up to a  day more than twice, more than five, even more than fifty times its  present duration. In round numbers, we may say that this great day  will occupy one thousand four hundred of our ordinary hours. To  realize the critical nature of the situation then arrived at, we must  follow the corresponding evolution through which the moon passes. From  its present distance of two hundred and forty thousand miles, the moon  will describe an ever-enlarging orbit; and as it does so the duration  of the month will also increase, until at last a point will be reached  when the month has become more than double its present length, and has  attained the particular value of one thousand four hundred hours. We  are specially to observe that this one-thousand four-hundred-hour  month will be exactly reached when the day has also expanded to one  thousand four hundred hours; and the essence of this critical  condition, which may be regarded as a significant point of tidal  evolution, is that the day and the month have again become equal. The  day and the month were equal at the beginning, the day and the month  will be equal at the end. Yet how wide is the difference between the  beginning and the end. The day or the month at the end is some  hundreds of times as long as the month or the day at the beginning.    I have already fully explained how, in any stage of the evolutionary  progress in which the day and the month became equal, the energy of  the system attained a maximum or a minimum value. At the beginning the  energy was a maximum; at the end the energy will be a minimum. The  most important consequences follow from this consideration. I have  already shown that a condition of maximum energy corresponded to  dynamic instability. Thus we saw that the earth-moon history could not  have commenced without the intervention of some influence other than  tides at the beginning. Now let us learn what the similar doctrine  has to tell us with regard to the end. The condition then arrived at  is one of dynamical stability; for suppose that the system were to  receive a slight alteration, by which the moon went out a little  further, and thus described a larger orbit, and so performed more than  its share of the moment of spin. Then the earth would have to do a  little less spinning, because, under all circumstances, the total  quantity of spin must be preserved unaltered. But the energy being at  a minimum, such a small displacement must of course produce a state of  things in which the energy would be increased. Or if we conceived the  moon to come in towards the earth, the moon would then contribute less  to the total moment of momentum. It would therefore be incumbent on  the earth to do more; and accordingly the velocity of the earth's  rotation would be augmented. But this arrangement also could only be  produced by the addition of some fresh energy to the system, because  the position from which the system is supposed to have been disturbed  is one of minimum energy.    No disturbance of the system from this final position is therefore  conceivable, unless some energy can be communicated to it. But this  will demonstrate the utter incompetency of the tides to shift the  system by a hair's breadth from this position; for it is of the  essence of the tides to waste energy by friction. And the  transformations of the system which the tides have caused are  invariably characterized by a decline of energy, the movements being  otherwise arranged so that the total moment of momentum shall be  preserved intact. Note, how far we were justified in speaking of this  condition as a final one. It is final so far as the lunar tides are  concerned; and were the system to be screened from all outer  interference, this accommodation between the earth and the moon would  be eternal.    There is indeed another way of demonstrating that a condition of the  system in which the day has assumed equality with the month must  necessarily be one of dynamical equilibrium. We have shown that the  energy which the tides demand is derived not from the mere fact that  there are high tides and low tides, but from the circumstance that  these tides do rise and fall; that in falling and rising they do  produce currents; and it is these currents which generate the friction  by which the earth's velocity is slowly abated, its energy wasted, and  no doubt ultimately dissipated as heat. If therefore we can make the  ebbing and the flowing of the tides to cease, then our argument will  disappear. Thus suppose, for the sake of illustration, that at a  moment when the tides happened to be at high water in the Thames, such  a change took place in the behaviour of the moon that the water always  remained full in the Thames, and at every other spot on the earth  remained fixed at the exact height which it possessed at this  particular moment. There would be no more tidal friction, and  therefore the system would cease to course through that series of  changes which the existence of tidal friction necessitates.    But if the tide is always to be full in the Thames, then the moon must  be always in the same position with respect to the meridian, that is,  the moon must always be fixed in the heavens over London. In fact, the  moon must then revolve around the earth just as fast as London  does--the month must have the same length as the day. The earth must  then show the same face constantly to the moon, just as the moon  always does show the same face towards the earth; the two globes will  in fact revolve as if they were connected with invisible bonds, which  united them into a single rigid body.    We need therefore feel no surprise at the cessation of the progress of  tidal evolution when the month and the day are equal, for then the  movement of moon-raised tides has ceased. No doubt the same may be  said of the state at the beginning of the history, when the day and  the month had the brief and equal duration of a few hours. While the  equality of the two periods lasted there could be no tides, and  therefore no progress in the direction of tidal evolution. There is,  however, the profound difference of stability and instability between  the two cases; the most insignificant disturbance of the system at the  initial stage was sufficient to precipitate the revolving moon from  its condition of dynamical equilibrium, and to start the course of  tidal evolution in full vigour. If, however, any trifling derangement  should take place in the last condition of the system, so that the  month and the day departed slightly from equality, there would  instantly be an ebbing and a flowing of the tides; and the friction  generated by these tides would operate to restore the equality because  this condition is one of dynamical stability.    It will thus be seen with what justice we can look forward to the day  and month each of fourteen hundred hours as a finale to the progress  of the luni-tidal evolution. Throughout the whole of this marvellous  series of changes it is always necessary to remember the one constant  and invariable element--the moment of momentum of the system which  tides cannot alter. Whatever else the friction can have done, however  fearful may have been the loss of energy by the system, the moment of  momentum which the system had at the beginning it preserves unto the  end. This it is which chiefly gives us the numerical data on which we  have to rely for the quantitative features of tidal evolution.    We have made so many demands in the course of these lectures on the  capacity of tidal friction to accomplish startling phenomena in the  evolution of the earth-moon system, that it is well for us to seek for  any evidence that may otherwise be obtainable as to the capacity of  tides for the accomplishment of gigantic operations. I do not say  that there is any doubt which requires to be dispelled by such  evidence, for as to the general outlines of the doctrine of tidal  evolution which has been here sketched out there can be no reasonable  ground for mistrust; but nevertheless it is always desirable to widen  our comprehension of any natural phenomena by observing collateral  facts. Now there is one branch of tidal action to which I have as yet  only in the most incidental way referred. We have been speaking of the  tides in the earth which are made to ebb and flow by the action of the  moon; we have now to consider the tides in the moon, which are there  excited by the action of the earth. For between these two bodies there  is a reciprocity of tidal-making energy--each of them is competent to  raise tides in the other. As the moon is so small in comparison with  the earth, and as the tides on the moon are of but little significance  in the progress of tidal evolution, it has been permissible for us to  omit them from our former discussion. But it is these tides on the  moon which will afford us a striking illustration of the competency of  tides for stupendous tasks. The moon presents a monument to show what  tides are able to accomplish.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--The Moon.]    I must first, however, explain a difficulty which is almost sure to  suggest itself when we speak of tides on the moon.
