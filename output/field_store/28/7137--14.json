Masticate the food until all taste has  disappeared, and then it will be found that the swallowing reflex  unconsciously absorbs the food, conscious swallowing, or at least, an  effort to swallow, not being called for.    It may take some while to get into the habit of thorough mastication  after having been accustomed to bolting food, but with a conscious  effort at the first, the habit is formed, and then the effort is no  longer a laborious exercise, but becomes perfectly natural and is  performed unconsciously.    This ought to be common knowledge. That such a subject is not considered  a necessary part of education is indeed lamentable, for the crass  ignorance that everywhere abounds upon the subject of nutrition and diet  is largely the cause of the frightful disease and debility so widespread  throughout the land, and, as a secondary evil of an enormous waste of  labour in the production and distribution of unneeded food. Were  everyone to live according to Nature, hygienically and modestly, health,  and all the happiness that comes with it, would become a national asset,  and as a result of the decreased consumption of food, more time would be  available for education, and the pursuit of all those arts which make  for the enlightenment and progress of humanity.    To become a convert to this new order, adopting non-animal food and  hygienic living, is not synonymous with monastical asceticism, as some  imagine. Meat eaters when first confronted with vegetarianism often  imagine their dietary is going to be restricted to a monotonous round of  carrots, turnips, cabbages, and the like; and if their ignorance  prevents them from arguing that it is impossible to maintain health and  strength on such foods, then it is very often objected that carrots and  cabbages are not liked, or would not be cared for _all_ the time. The  best way to answer this objection is to cite a few plain facts. From a  catalogue of a firm supplying vegetarian specialties, (and there are now  quite a number of such firms), most of the following information is  derived:    Of nuts there are twelve varieties, sold either shelled, ground, or in  shell. Many of these nuts are also mechanically prepared, and in some  cases combined, and made into butters, nut-meats, lard, suet, oil, etc.  The varieties of nut-butters are many, and the various combinations of  nuts and vegetables making potted savouries, add to a long list of  highly nutritious and palatable nut-foods. There are the pulses dried  and entire, or ground into flour, such as pea-, bean-, and lentil-flour.  There are the cereals, barley, corn, oats, rice, rye, wheat, etc., from  which the number of preparations made such as breakfast foods, bread,  biscuits, cakes, pastries, etc., is legion. (One firm advertises  twenty-three varieties of prepared breakfast foods made from cereals.)  Then there are the fruits, fresh, canned, and preserved, about  twenty-five varieties; green vegetables, fresh and canned, about  twenty-one varieties; and roots, about eleven varieties.    The difficulty is not that there is insufficient variety, but that the  variety is so large that there is danger of being tempted beyond the  limits dictated by the needs of the body. When, having had sufficient  to eat, there yet remain many highly palatable dishes untasted, one is  sometimes apt to gratify sense at the expense of health and  good-breeding, to say nothing of economy. Simplicity and purity in food  are essential to physical health as simplicity and purity in art are  essential to moral and intellectual progress. 'I may say,' says Dr.  Haig, 'that simple food of not more than two or three kinds at one meal  is another secret of health; and if this seems harsh to those whose day  is at present divided between anticipating their food and eating, I must  ask them to consider whether such a life is not the acme of selfish  shortsightedness. In case they should ever be at a loss what to do with  the time and money thus saved from feasting, I would point on the one  hand to the mass of unrelieved ignorance, sorrow, and suffering, and on  the other to the doors of literature and art, which stand open to those  fortunate enough to have time to enter them; and from none of these need  any turn aside for want of new Kingdoms to conquer.'    This question of feeding may, by superficial thinkers, be looked upon as  unimportant; yet it should not be forgotten that diet has much more to  do with health than is commonly realized, and health is intimately  connected with mental attitude, and oftentimes is at the foundation of  religious and moral development. 'Hypochondriacal crotchets' are often  the product of dyspepsia, and valetudinarianism and pessimism are not  unrarely found together. 'Alas,' says Carlyle, 'what is the loftiest  flight of genius, the finest frenzy that ever for moments united Heaven  with Earth, to the perennial never-failing joys of a digestive apparatus  thoroughly eupeptic?'    Our first duty is to learn to keep our body healthy. Naturally, we  sooner expect to see a noble character possess a beautiful form than one  disfigured by abuse and polluted by disease. We do not say that every  sick man is a villain, but we do say that men and women of high  character regard the body as an instrument for some high purpose, and  believe that it should be cared for and nourished according to its  natural requirements. In vegetarianism, _scientifically practised_, is a  cure, and better, a preventative, for many physical, mental, and moral  obliquities that trouble mankind, and if only a knowledge of this fact  were to grow and distil itself into the public mind and conscience,  there would be halcyon days in store for future generations, and much  that now envelops man in darkness and in sorrow, would be regarded as a  nightmare of the past.

The  passage in the archives runs as follows:--\"Memorandum, that in the year  1336, there was made a new window in Christ Church, Canterbury, that is to  say, in the chapel of the Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, upon which  there were expended the following sums:                                                         _L   s.   d._  \"Imprimis, for the workmanship, or labour of the      masons                                           21   17   9  Item, for the breaking down of the wall, where the      window now is                                     0   16   9  ----for lime and gravel                               1    0   0  ----for 20 cwt. of iron bought for said window        4    4   0  ----for the labour of the smiths                      3    5   4  ----for Caen stone bought for same                    5    0   0  ----for glass and the labour of the glaziers          6   13   4                                                       -----------                                          Total        42   17   2.\"    On the heads of the lights of this window were pendent bosses, like those  of the door in the choir-screen, which, as has been said, was also the  work of Prior de Estria. These bosses and the stones from which they were  suspended, have altogether disappeared, otherwise the internal tracery of  the window is in good preservation. \"The outside, however, is in a very  bad condition for the purpose of the antiquarian; for, apparently on  account of the decayed state of its surface, the tracery has undergone the  process of splitting, namely, the whole of the outer part has been faced  down to the glass, and fresh worked in Portland stone; Portland stone  mullions, or _monials_ as they are more properly called, have also been  supplied. And as this repair was executed at a period when this class of  architecture was ill understood, the mouldings were very badly wrought,  which, with the unfortunate colour and surface of the Portland stone, has  given the window a most ungenuine air. However, the interior is as good as  ever it was, and it is on account of its date, as well as for its beauty,  a most valuable example\" (Willis).    The insertion of the window in question probably had the effect of  weakening the walls of the chapel; at any rate they show signs of a  tendency to settle. Beneath it is the tomb of Archbishop Bradwardine, a  great scholar and divine, whose primacy only lasted three months. Opposite  to him lies Simon de Mepeham--archbishop from 1328 to 1333--whose tomb  forms the screen of the chapel. It is a black marble monument well worthy  of examination, with a double arcade and a richly decorated canopy; the  ornamentation has been greatly damaged, but the shattered remains show  traces of beautiful work. Mepeham's short primacy was brought to an  untimely end by the contumacy of Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter, who refused  to allow him to enter Exeter Cathedral, actually guarding the west door  with an armed force. The pope sided with the recalcitrant bishop, and  Mepeham died, according to Fuller, of a broken heart in consequence of  this humiliation.    #The Watching Chamber.#--Above the Chapel of St. Anselm is a small room,  which is reached by a staircase from the north-west corner. A window in  it commands a view into the cathedral, and from this circumstance it has  been inferred that a watcher was stationed here at night to protect the  priceless treasures of St. Thomas's shrine from pillage by marauders. Some  doubt has been thrown on this assumption, since the site of the shrine is  not fully seen from the window, but the room is still generally known as  the Watching Chamber. Probably the shrine was much more efficiently  guarded than by the presence of a solitary monk in a chamber, from which  even if he could see thieves he certainly could not arrest them; for we  know that \"on the occasion of fires the shrine was additionally guarded by  a troop of fierce ban-dogs\" (Stanley). It is also said that King John of  France was imprisoned in this chamber during his stay at Canterbury, but  this is most unlikely, seeing that he was treated by the Black Prince more  as a sovereign than as a captive.    [Illustration: SOME MOSAICS FROM THE FLOOR OF TRINITY CHAPEL.]    #Trinity Chapel.#--Passing further east, we ascend the flight of steps,  deeply worn by innumerable pilgrims, and enter the precincts of the  Trinity Chapel. All this part of the cathedral, from the choir-screen  to the corona, was rebuilt from the ground, specially with a view to its  receiving the shrine of St. Thomas. It is still, however, called by the  name of the Trinity Chapel, which previously occupied this site, and was  burnt down by the fire which destroyed Conrad's choir. In this chapel  Thomas a Becket celebrated his first mass after his installation as  archbishop, and his remains were laid for some time in the crypt below  it. This portion of the building was all carried out under the direction  of English William. Gervase relates that when William of Sens, after his  accident, \"perceiving that he derived no benefit from the physicians,  returned to his home in France,\" his successor, English William \"laid the  foundation for the enlargement of the church at the eastern part, because  a chapel of St. Thomas was to be built there; for this was the place  assigned to him; namely the Chapel of the Holy Trinity, where he  celebrated his first mass--where he was wont to prostrate himself with  tears and prayers, under whose crypt for so many years he was buried,  where God for his merits had performed so many miracles, where poor and  rich, kings and princes, had worshipped him, and whence the sound of his  praises had gone out into all lands.\" As to the extent to which the second  William was guided by the plans of his predecessor we have no means of  judging accurately. Certainly the general outline of this part of the  building must have been arranged by William of Sens, for the contraction  of the choir, in order to preserve the width of the ancient Trinity Chapel  had been carried out up to the clerestory before his retirement. Willis  deals with the subject at some length: \"Whether,\" he says, \"we are to  attribute to the French artist the lofty elevation of the pavement of  the new chapel, by which also so handsome a crypt is obtained below, must  remain doubtful. The bases of his columns, as well as those of the shafts  against the wall are hidden and smothered by the platform at the top of  these steps and by the side steps that lead to Becket's chapel. This looks  like an evidence of a change of plan, and induces me to believe that the  lofty crypt below may be considered as the unfettered composition of the  English architect.... The Trinity Chapel of the Englishman is under the  influence of the French work of which it is a continuation, and  accordingly the same mouldings are employed throughout, and the triforium  and clerestory are continued at the same level; but the greater level of  the pavement wholly alters the proportion of the piers to their arches,  and gives a new and original, and at the same time a very elegant  character to this part of the church compared with the work of the  Frenchman, of which, at first sight, it seems to be a mere continuation.  The triforium also of this Trinity Chapel differs from that of the choir,  in that its four pointed arches instead of being, like them, included  under two circular ones, are set in the form of an arcade of four arches,  of two orders of mouldings each. The mouldings are the same as in the  choir, but the effect of their arrangement is richer. Also in the  clerestory two windows are placed over each pier-arch, instead of the  single window of the choir. The mixture of the two forms of arches is  still carried on, for although the semicircular arch is banished from  the triforium, it is adopted for the pier-arches.    \"However, in the side-aisles of the Trinity chapel, and in the corona,  our English William appears to have freed himself almost as completely  from the shackles of imitation, as was possible. In the side-aisles the  mouldings of the ribs still remain the same, but their management in  connection with the side walls, and the combination of their slender  shafts with those of the twin lancet windows, here for the first time  introduced into the building, is very happy. Slender shafts of marble are  employed in profusion by William of Sens, and Gervase expressly includes  them in his list of characteristic novelties. But here we find them either  detached from the piers, or combined with them in such a manner as to  give a much greater lightness and elegance of effect than in the work of  the previous architect. This lightness of style is carried still farther  in the corona, where the slender shafts are carried round the walls, and  made principal supports to the pier-arches, over which is placed a light  triforium and a clerestory; and it must be remarked that all the arches in  this part of the building are of a single order of mouldings, instead of  two orders as in the pier-arches and triforium of the choir.\"    So much for the architectural details of the Trinity Chapel. To the  ordinary visitor its interest lies rather in the fact that it contained  Becket's shrine, and that we here see the curious old windows portraying  the sainted Archbishop's miracles, and what is, perhaps, most important of  all to many, #the tomb of Edward the Black Prince#. This monument is the  first feature that we notice as we enter by the south-west gate of the  chapel; it stands between the two first pillars, and by the side of the  site of the shrine. By the Prince's will he had left directions that"]]]
