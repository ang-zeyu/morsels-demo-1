For in case  bodies attract one another in proportion to the quantity of matter  contained in them, it can only be in proportion to the quantity of their  parts; and if this power is found in the whole, it is undoubtedly in the  half; in the quarters in the eighth part, and so on in _infinitum_.    This is attraction, the great spring by which all Nature is moved.  Sir  Isaac Newton, after having demonstrated the existence of this principle,  plainly foresaw that its very name would offend; and, therefore, this  philosopher, in more places than one of his books, gives the reader some  caution about it.  He bids him beware of confounding this name with what  the ancients called occult qualities, but to be satisfied with knowing  that there is in all bodies a central force, which acts to the utmost  limits of the universe, according to the invariable laws of mechanics.    It is surprising, after the solemn protestations Sir Isaac made, that  such eminent men as Mr. Sorin and Mr. de Fontenelle should have imputed  to this great philosopher the verbal and chimerical way of reasoning of  the Aristotelians; Mr. Sorin in the Memoirs of the Academy of 1709, and  Mr. de Fontenelle in the very eulogium of Sir Isaac Newton.    Most of the French (the learned and others) have repeated this reproach.  These are for ever crying out, \"Why did he not employ the word  _impulsion_, which is so well understood, rather than that of  _attraction_, which is unintelligible?\"    Sir Isaac might have answered these critics thus:--\"First, you have as  imperfect an idea of the word impulsion as of that of attraction; and in  case you cannot conceive how one body tends towards the centre of another  body, neither can you conceive by what power one body can impel another.    \"Secondly, I could not admit of impulsion; for to do this I must have  known that a celestial matter was the agent.  But so far from knowing  that there is any such matter, I have proved it to be merely imaginary.    \"Thirdly, I use the word attraction for no other reason but to express an  effect which I discovered in Nature--a certain and indisputable effect of  an unknown principle--a quality inherent in matter, the cause of which  persons of greater abilities than I can pretend to may, if they can, find  out.\"    \"What have you, then, taught us?\" will these people say further; \"and to  what purpose are so many calculations to tell us what you yourself do not  comprehend?\"    \"I have taught you,\" may Sir Isaac rejoin, \"that all bodies gravitate  towards one another in proportion to their quantity of matter; that these  central forces alone keep the planets and comets in their orbits, and  cause them to move in the proportion before set down.  I demonstrate to  you that it is impossible there should be any other cause which keeps the  planets in their orbits than that general phenomenon of gravity.  For  heavy bodies fall on the earth according to the proportion demonstrated  of central forces; and the planets finishing their course according to  these same proportions, in case there were another power that acted upon  all those bodies, it would either increase their velocity or change their  direction.  Now, not one of those bodies ever has a single degree of  motion or velocity, or has any direction but what is demonstrated to be  the effect of the central forces.  Consequently it is impossible there  should be any other principle.\"    Give me leave once more to introduce Sir Isaac speaking.  Shall he not be  allowed to say? \"My case and that of the ancients is very different.  These saw, for instance, water ascend in pumps, and said, 'The water  rises because it abhors a vacuum.'  But with regard to myself; I am in  the case of a man who should have first observed that water ascends in  pumps, but should leave others to explain the cause of this effect.  The  anatomist, who first declared that the motion of the arm is owing to the  contraction of the muscles, taught mankind an indisputable truth.  But  are they less obliged to him because he did not know the reason why the  muscles contract?  The cause of the elasticity of the air is unknown, but  he who first discovered this spring performed a very signal service to  natural philosophy.  The spring that I discovered was more hidden and  more universal, and for that very reason mankind ought to thank me the  more.  I have discovered a new property of matter--one of the secrets of  the Creator--and have calculated and discovered the effects of it.  After  this, shall people quarrel with me about the name I give it?\"    Vortices may be called an occult quality, because their existence was  never proved.  Attraction, on the contrary, is a real thing, because its  effects are demonstrated, and the proportions of it are calculated.  The  cause of this cause is among the _Arcana_ of the Almighty.       \"Precedes huc, et non amplius.\"    (Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.)        LETTER XVI.--ON SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S OPTICS      The philosophers of the last age found out a new universe; and a  circumstance which made its discovery more difficult was that no one had  so much as suspected its existence.  The most sage and judicious were of  opinion that it was a frantic rashness to dare so much as to imagine that  it was possible to guess the laws by which the celestial bodies move and  the manner how light acts.  Galileo, by his astronomical discoveries,  Kepler, by his calculation, Descartes (at least, in his dioptrics), and  Sir Isaac Newton, in all his works, severally saw the mechanism of the  springs of the world.  The geometricians have subjected infinity to the  laws of calculation.  The circulation of the blood in animals, and of the  sap in vegetables, have changed the face of Nature with regard to us.  A  new kind of existence has been given to bodies in the air-pump.  By the  assistance of telescopes bodies have been brought nearer to one another.  Finally, the several discoveries which Sir Isaac Newton has made on light  are equal to the boldest things which the curiosity of man could expect  after so many philosophical novelties.    Till Antonio de Dominis the rainbow was considered as an inexplicable  miracle.  This philosopher guessed that it was a necessary effect of the  sun and rain.  Descartes gained immortal fame by his mathematical  explication of this so natural a phenomenon.  He calculated the  reflections and refractions of light in drops of rain.  And his sagacity  on this occasion was at that time looked upon as next to divine.    But what would he have said had it been proved to him that he was  mistaken in the nature of light; that he had not the least reason to  maintain that it is a globular body?  That it is false to assert that  this matter, spreading itself through the whole, waits only to be  projected forward by the sun, in order to be put in action, in like  manner as a long staff acts at one end when pushed forward by the other.  That light is certainly darted by the sun; in fine, that light is  transmitted from the sun to the earth in about seven minutes, though a  cannonball, which were not to lose any of its velocity, could not go that  distance in less than twenty-five years.  How great would have been his  astonishment had he been told that light does not reflect directly by  impinging against the solid parts of bodies, that bodies are not  transparent when they have large pores, and that a man should arise who  would demonstrate all these paradoxes, and anatomise a single ray of  light with more dexterity than the ablest artist dissects a human body.  This man is come.  Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated to the eye, by the  bare assistance of the prism, that light is a composition of coloured  rays, which, being united, form white colour.  A single ray is by him  divided into seven, which all fall upon a piece of linen, or a sheet of  white paper, in their order, one above the other, and at unequal  distances.  The first is red, the second orange, the third yellow, the  fourth green, the fifth blue, the sixth indigo, the seventh a  violet-purple.  Each of these rays, transmitted afterwards by a hundred  other prisms, will never change the colour it bears; in like manner, as  gold, when completely purged from its dross, will never change afterwards  in the crucible.  As a superabundant proof that each of these elementary  rays has inherently in itself that which forms its colour to the eye,  take a small piece of yellow wood, for instance, and set it in the ray of  a red colour; this wood will instantly be tinged red.  But set it in the  ray of a green colour, it assumes a green colour, and so of all the rest.    From what cause, therefore, do colours arise in Nature?  It is nothing  but the disposition of bodies to reflect the rays of a certain order and  to absorb all the rest.    What, then, is this secret disposition?  Sir Isaac Newton demonstrates  that it is nothing more than the density of the small constituent  particles of which a body is composed.  And how is this reflection  performed?  It was supposed to arise from the rebounding of the rays, in  the same manner as a ball on the surface of a solid body.  But this is a  mistake, for Sir Isaac taught the astonished philosophers that bodies are  opaque for no other reason but because their pores are large, that light  reflects on our eyes from the very bosom of those pores, that the smaller  the pores of a body are the more such a body is transparent.  Thus paper,  which reflects the light when dry, transmits it when oiled, because the  oil, by filling its pores, makes them much smaller.    It is there that examining the vast porosity of bodies, every particle  having its pores, and every particle of those particles having its own,  he shows we are not certain that there is a cubic inch of solid matter in  the universe, so far are we from conceiving what matter is.

That figure was Newman's.    Since his conversion, Newman's life had been a long series of  misfortunes and disappointments. When he had left the Church of England,  he was its most distinguished, its most revered member, whose words,  however strange, were listened to with profound attention, and whose  opinions, however dubious, were followed in all their fluctuations with  an eager and indeed a trembling respect. He entered the Church of Rome,  and found himself forthwith an unimportant man. He was received at the  Papal Court with a politeness which only faintly concealed a total lack  of interest and understanding. His delicate mind, with its refinements,  its hesitations, its complexities--his soft, spectacled, Oxford manner,  with its half-effeminate diffidence-such things were ill calculated to  impress a throng of busy Cardinals and Bishops, whose days were spent  amid the practical details of ecclesiastical organisation, the  long-drawn involutions of papal diplomacy, and the delicious bickerings  of personal intrigue. And when, at last, he did succeed in making some  impression upon these surroundings, it was no better; it was worse. An  uneasy suspicion gradually arose; it began to dawn upon the Roman  authorities that Dr. Newman was a man of ideas. Was it possible that Dr.  Newman did not understand that ideas in Rome were, to say the least of  it, out of place? Apparently, he did not--nor was that all; not content  with having ideas, he positively seemed anxious to spread them. When  that was known, the politeness in high places was seen to be wearing  decidedly thin. His Holiness, who on Newman's arrival had graciously  expressed the wish to see him 'again and again', now, apparently, was  constantly engaged. At first Newman supposed that the growing coolness  was the result of misapprehension; his Italian was faulty, Latin was not  spoken at Rome, his writings had only appeared in garbled translations.  And even Englishmen had sometimes found his arguments difficult to  follow. He therefore determined to take the utmost care to make his  views quite clear; his opinions upon religious probability, his  distinction between demonstrative and circumstantial evidence, his  theory of the development of doctrine and the aspects of ideas--these  and many other matters, upon which he had written so much, he would now  explain in the simplest language. He would show that there was nothing  dangerous in what he held, that there was a passage in De Lugo which  supported him--that Perrone, by maintaining that the Immaculate  Conception could be defined, had implicitly admitted one of his main  positions, and that his language about Faith had been confused, quite  erroneously, with the fideism of M. Bautain.    Cardinal Barnabo, Cardinal Reisach, Cardinal Antonelli, looked at him  with their shrewd eyes and hard faces, while he poured into their ears  which, as he had already noticed with distress, were large and not too  clean--his careful disquisitions; but, it was all in vain--they had  clearly never read De Lugo or Perrone, and as for M. Bautain, they had  never heard of him. Newman, in despair, fell back upon St. Thomas  Aquinas; but, to his horror, he observed that St. Thomas himself did not  mean very much to the Cardinals. With a sinking heart, he realised at  last the painful truth: it was not the nature of his views, it was his  having views at all, that was objectionable. He had hoped to devote the  rest of his life to the teaching of Theology; but what sort of Theology  could he teach which would be acceptable to such superiors? He left  Rome, and settled down in Birmingham as the head of a small community of  Oratorians. He did not complain; it was God's will; it was better so. He  would watch and pray.    But God's will was not quite so simple as that. Was it right, after all,  that a man with Newman's intellectual gifts, his devoted ardour, his  personal celebrity, should sink away out of sight and use in the dim  recesses of the Oratory at Birmingham? If the call were to come to him  to take his talent out of the napkin, how could he refuse? And the call  did come. A Catholic University was being started in Ireland and Dr.  Cullen, the Archbishop of Armagh, begged Newman to become the Rector. At  first he hesitated, but when he learned that it was the Holy Father's  wish that he should take up the work, he could doubt no longer; the  offer was sent from Heaven. The difficulties before him were very great;  not only had a new University to be called up out of the void, but the  position was complicated by the presence of a rival institution--the  undenominational Queen's Colleges, founded by Peel a few years earlier  with the object of giving Irish Catholics facilities for University  education on the same terms as their fellow-countrymen. Yet Newman had  the highest hopes. He dreamt of something greater than a merely Irish  University--of a noble and flourishing centre of learning for the  Catholics of Ireland and England alike. And why should not his dream  come true? 'In the midst of our difficulties, he said, 'I have one  ground of hope, just one stay, but, as I think, a sufficient one, which  serves me in the stead of all other argument whatever. It is the  decision of the Holy See; St. Peter has spoken.'    The years that followed showed to what extent it was safe to depend upon  St. Peter. Unforeseen obstacles cropped up on every side. Newman's  energies were untiring, but so was the inertia of the Irish authorities.  On his appointment, he wrote to Dr. Cullen asking that arrangements  might be made for his reception in Dublin. Dr. Cullen did not reply.  Newman wrote again, but still there was no answer. Weeks passed, months  passed, years passed, and not a word, not a sign, came from Dr. Cullen.  At last, after dangling for more than two years in the uncertainties and  perplexities of so strange a situation, Newman was summoned to Dublin.  There he found nothing but disorder and discouragement. The laity took  no interest in the scheme; the clergy actively disliked it; Newman's  authority was disregarded. He appealed to Cardinal Wiseman, and then at  last a ray of hope dawned. The cardinal suggested that a bishopric  should be conferred upon him, to give him a status suitable to his  position; Dr. Cullen acquiesced, and Pius IX was all compliance.  'Manderemo a Newman la crocetta,' he said to Wiseman, smilingly drawing  his hands down each side of his neck to his breast, 'lo faremo vescovo  di Porfirio, o qualche luogo.' The news spread among Newman's friends,  and congratulations began to come in. But the official intimation seemed  to be unaccountably delayed; no crocetta came from Rome, and Cardinal  Wiseman never again referred to the matter. Newman was left to gather  that the secret representations of Dr. Cullen had brought about a change  of counsel in high quarters. His pride did not allow him to inquire  further; but one of his lady penitents, Miss Giberne, was less discreet.  'Holy Father,' she suddenly said to the Pope in an audience one day,  'why don't you make Father Newman a bishop?' Upon which the Holy Father  looked much confused and took a great deal of snuff.    For the next five years Newman, unaided and ignored, struggled  desperately, like a man in a bog, with the overmastering difficulties of  his task. His mind, whose native haunt was among the far aerial  boundaries of fancy and philosophy, was now clamped down under the  fetters of petty detail and fed upon the mean diet of compromise and  routine. He had to force himself to scrape together money, to write  articles for the students' Gazette, to make plans for medical  laboratories, to be ingratiating with the City Council; he was obliged  to spend months travelling through the remote regions of Ireland in the  company of extraordinary ecclesiastics and barbarous squireens. He was a  thoroughbred harnessed to a four-wheeled cab--and he knew it.  Eventually, he realised something else: he saw that the whole project of  a Catholic University had been evolved as a political and ecclesiastical  weapon against the Queen's Colleges of Peel, and that was all. As an  instrument of education, it was simply laughed at; and he himself had  been called in because his name would be a valuable asset in a party  game. When he understood that, he resigned his rectorship and returned  to the Oratory.    But, his tribulations were not yet over. It seemed to be God's will that  he should take part in a whole succession of schemes, which, no less  than the project of the Irish University, were to end in disillusionment  and failure. He was persuaded by Cardinal Wiseman to undertake the  editorship of a new English version of the Scriptures, which was to be a  monument of Catholic scholarship and an everlasting glory to Mother  Church. He made elaborate preparations; he collected subscriptions,  engaged contributors, and composed a long and learned prolegomena to the  work. It was all useless; Cardinal Wiseman began to think of other  things; and the scheme faded imperceptibly into thin air. Then a new  task was suggested to him: \"The Rambler\", a Catholic periodical, had  fallen on evil days; would Dr Newman come to the rescue, and accept the  editorship? This time he hesitated rather longer than usual; he had  burned his fingers so often--he must be specially careful now. 'I did  all I could to ascertain God's Will,' he said, and he came to the  conclusion that it was his duty to undertake the work. He did so, and  after two numbers had appeared, Dr. Ullathorne, the Bishop of  Birmingham, called upon him, and gently hinted that he had better leave  the paper alone. Its tone was not liked at Rome; it had contained an  article criticising St. Pius V, and, most serious of all, the orthodoxy  of one of Newman's own essays had appeared to be doubtful. "]]]
