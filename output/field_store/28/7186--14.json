I  move to amend by inserting _eleven_ o'clock.    Mr. EWING:--I think we had better let the hour of meeting remain where  our rules leave it. We shall find our labors severe enough if we  commence at twelve o'clock.    Mr. CRISFIELD:--I will accept the amendment of my colleague. Let the  time of meeting be eleven o'clock.    The motion of Mr. CRISFIELD as amended was agreed to without a  division.    Mr. CHASE:--I have a motion which I desire to make, and as I do not  wish to press it to a vote at the present time, I will move to lay it  on the table. But I wish to have it before the Conference. It is  apparent to me that we ought to pass it at some time, in order to give  members who may belong to delegations in which differences of opinion  exist, an opportunity of appearing on the record as they personally  wish to vote. I move to amend the first rule by inserting after the  word \"representing,\" the words, \"The yeas and nays of the delegates  from each State, on any question, shall be entered on the Journal when  it is desired by any delegate.\"    On motion of Mr. CHASE, the amendment was laid upon the table.    The PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the order of the  day, the question being upon the several reports presented by the  General Committee of one from each State.    The chair was taken, at the request of the PRESIDENT, by Mr.  ALEXANDER, of New Jersey.    Mr. BALDWIN:--I move to substitute the report presented by myself for  the report of the majority of the Committee. I will consent to strike  out that part of it which relates to--    Mr. TURNER:--Before the gentleman from Connecticut proceeds with his  argument I trust he will give way for the introduction of a  resolution. I am sure the time has come when we ought to pass such a  resolution as I now offer. I am unwilling to sit here longer unless  some means are taken to secure a report of our proceedings.    The PRESIDENT:--A resolution is not now in order.    Mr. TURNER:--I ask that the resolution may be read for the information  of the Conference, and also ask the leave of the Conference for its  introduction.    The resolution was read. It provided for the appointment of a  stenographer.    The question was taken, and upon a division the leave to introduce it  was refused.    Mr. BALDWIN:--I rise for the purpose of supporting my motion to  substitute the report presented by myself for that presented by the  majority of the committee. As I was about to remark, when the  resolution just disposed of was introduced, I will consent to strike  out all that portion of my report which precedes the words \"whereas  unhappy differences,\" &c., in order that the substitute offered may  conform more nearly in substance to the proposition of the majority.  It seems desirable on all hands that whatever we adopt here should be  presented to Congress; and if it receives the sanction of that body,  should be by it presented to the States for their approval. My report  when thus amended will be in a proper form for such a disposition.    My report, it will be noticed, is based mainly upon the action of the  Legislature of Kentucky. I have adopted those resolutions of Kentucky  as the basis of my recommendation, on account of the short time which  remains for any action at all, and because it appears to me that the  kind of proceeding indicated in them is best calculated to meet with  favor in the States which must approve any action taken here before it  can be made effectual.    The resolutions of Virginia, under which this Convention is called,  were adopted on the 19th of January last. The resolutions of Kentucky  to which I have referred were adopted on the 25th of the same month.  It is not only the necessary presumption that the latter were passed  with a full knowledge of the action of Virginia, but I understand from  their reading that they were adopted in consequence of the proposition  of the latter State. I am disposed to favor the line of policy  initiated in the resolutions of the State of Kentucky.    There are two ways of presenting amendments to the Constitution  provided in that instrument. By the first, by Congress whenever  two-thirds of both Houses shall deem such amendments necessary: or by  the second, the same body, upon the application of the Legislatures of  two-thirds of the States, may call a convention for the purpose of  proposing amendments. These two are the _only_ modes in which, under  that instrument, amendments can be proposed to the Constitution.  Either of these is adequate, and it was the manifest intention of its  framers to secure due consideration of any changes which might be  proposed to the fundamental law of our Government.    It is conceded on all hands that our action here will amount to  nothing, unless it meets the approval of Congress, and such proposals  of amendment as we shall agree upon are recommended by that body to  the States for adoption. The session of the present Congress is  drawing to a close. There remain only fifteen or sixteen days during  which it can transact business. Can any one suppose that in the  present state of the country, with the large number of important  measures before Congress and awaiting its action, any proposition of  real importance emanating from this Conference could be properly  considered by either House in this short time? I am assuming just now  that this is a Convention which has the right, under the Constitution  or by precedent, to make such propositions. But if we do not remember,  most certainly Congress will, that however respectable this body may  be, however large may be the constituency which it represents, it is,  after all, one which has no existence under, and is not recognized by  the Constitution. In a recent speech in the Senate, Judge COLLAMER, of  Vermont, one of the ablest lawyers in that body, has more than  intimated a doubt whether Congress could, under the Constitution,  entertain proposals of amendment presented to it by such a body as  this. But, waiving all technicalities, the substantial objection which  influences my mind is, that the course of action proposed by the  majority of the committee is contrary to the spirit of the  Constitution. When the people adopted that instrument and subjected  themselves to its operation, they intended and had a right to  understand that it should be amended only in the manner provided by  the Constitution itself. They did not intend that amendments should be  proposed under, or the existence of the Constitution endangered by any  extraneous pressure whatever. They wisely provided a way in which  amendments might be proposed, or rather two ways. Under either of  them, due examination and consideration was secured. They would not  have consented to any other way of proposing amendments. The General  Government, on the adoption of the Constitution, for all national  purposes, took the place of the State Governments. The people of the  United States from that time, in the language of a distinguished  Senator from Kentucky, owed a paramount allegiance to the General  Government, and a subordinate allegiance only to the State  Governments. Changes in the Constitution, then, can only be _properly_  made in the manner provided by the Constitution. Propositions for  changes in it must come from the people, or their representatives in  Congress. Any attempt to coerce Congress, or to influence its action  in a manner not provided by the Constitution, is a disregard of the  rights of the people.    Why are we assembled here to urge these amendments upon Congress? to  induce Congress to recommend them to the people for adoption? Are we  the representatives of the people of the United States? Are we acting  for them, and as their authorized agents, in this endeavor to press  amendments upon the attention of Congress? Because, if our action is  to have any effect at all, it must be to induce Congress to conform to  our wishes--to propose the very amendments which we prepare.    The members of the House of Representatives were elected by the  people. They were selected to perform, and they do perform, their  duties and functions under the obligations of their official oaths.  There is no question about their agency, or their right to act in the  premises. The Constitution makes them the agents of the people. The  Legislature of the State of Kentucky, well understanding and  appreciating the only true method in which constitutional amendments  should be proposed, with all the formality of a legislative act  approved by the Executive of that State, has applied to Congress for  the call of a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution  of the United States, and has requested the President to lay those  resolutions immediately before Congress. She wishes other States to  unite with her in the preparing and proposing of amendments to the  Constitution. This is the correct, the legal, the patriotic course.  This was what Kentucky had the right to ask, and this is all she has  asked.    Mr. BALDWIN here read the Kentucky resolutions, as follows:         _Resolutions recommending a call for a Convention of the       United States._         _Whereas_, The people of some of the States feel themselves       deeply aggrieved by the policy and measures which have been       adopted by some of the people of the other States; and       _whereas_ an amendment of the Constitution of the United       States is deemed indispensably necessary to secure them       against similar grievances in the future: Therefore,         _Resolved_, by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of       Kentucky, that application to Congress to call a Convention       for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United       States, pursuant to the fifth article thereof, be, and the       same is hereby, now made by this General Assembly of       Kentucky; and we hereby invite our sister States to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24562"],[0,"The Panjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir (#14)"],[1,"procera, N.O.  Asclepiadaceae), the _harmal_ (Peganum harmala, N.O. Rutaceae), and the  colocynth gourd (Citrullus colocynthis, N.O. Cucurbitaceae), which,  owing to the size of its roots, manages to flourish in the sands of  African and Indian deserts, grow abundantly. Common weeds of cultivation  are Fumaria parviflora, a near relation of the English fumitory, Silene  conoidea, and two Spergulas (Caryophyllaceae), and Sisymbrium Irio  (Cruciferae). A curious little Orchid, Zeuxine sulcata, is found growing  among the grass on canal banks. The American yellow poppy, Argemone  Mexicana, a noxious weed, has unfortunately established itself widely in  the Panjab plain. Two trees of the order Leguminosae, the _shisham_ or  _tali_ (Dalbergia Sissoo) and the _siris_ (Albizzia lebbek), are  commonly planted on Panjab roads. The true home of the former is in  river beds in the low hills or in ravines below the hills. But it is a  favourite tree on roads and near wells throughout the province, and  deservedly so, for it yields excellent timber. The _siris_ on the other  hand is an untidy useless tree. The _kikar_ might be planted as a  roadside tree to a greater extent. Several species of figs, especially  the _pipal_ (Ficus religiosa) and _bor_ or banian (Ficus Indica) are  popular trees.    ~Salt Range and North-West Plains.~---Our second region may be taken as  extending from the Pabbi hills on the east of the Jhelam in Gujrat to  our administrative boundary beyond the Indus, its southern limit being  the Salt Range. Here the flora is of a distinctly Mediterranean type.  Poppies are as familiar in Rawalpindi as they are in England or Italy,  and Hypecoum procumbens, a curious Italian plant of the same order, is  found in Attock. The abundance of Crucifers is also a Mediterranean  feature. Eruca sativa, the oil-seed known as _taramira_ or _jamian_,  which sows itself freely in waste land and may be found growing even on  railway tracks in the Rawalpindi division, is an Italian and Spanish  weed. Malcolmia strigosa, which spreads a reddish carpet over the  ground, and Malcolmia Africana are common Crucifers near Rawalpindi. The  latter is a Mediterranean species. The Salt Range genera Diplotaxis and  Moricandia are Italian, and the peculiar Notoceras Canariensis found in  Attock is also a native of the Canary Islands. Another order,  Boraginaceae, which is very prominent in the Mediterranean region, is  also important in the North-West Panjab, though the showier plants of  the order are wanting. One curious Borage, Arnebia Griffithii, seems to  be purely Asiatic. It has five brown spots on its petals, which fade and  disappear in the noonday sunshine. These are supposed to be drops of  sweat which fell from Muhammad's forehead, hence the plant is called  _paighambari phul_ or the prophet's flower. Among Composites Calendulas  and Carthamus oxyacantha or the _pohli_, a near relation of the  Carthamus which yields the saffron dye, are abundant. Both are common  Mediterranean genera. Silybum Marianum, a handsome thistle with large  leaves mottled with white, extends from Britain to Rawalpindi.  Interesting species are Tulipa stellata and Tulipa chrysantha. The  latter is a Salt Range plant, as is the crocus-like Merendera Persica,  and the yellow Iris Aitchisoni. A curious plant found in the same hills  is the cactus-like Boucerosia (N.O. Asclepiadaceae), recalling to  botanists the more familiar Stapelias of the same order. Another  leafless Asclepiad, Periploca aphylla, which extends westwards to Arabia  and Nubia and southwards to Sindh, is, like Boucerosia, a typical  xerophyte adapted to a very dry soil and atmosphere. The thorny Acacias,  A. eburnea and A. modesta (vern. _phulahi_), of the low bare hills of  the N.W. Panjab are also drought-resisting plants.    ~Submontane Region.~--The Submontane region consists of a broad belt below  the Siwaliks extending from the Jamna nearly to the Jhelam, and may be  said to include the districts of Ambala, Karnal (part), Hoshyarpur,  Kangra (part), Hazara (part), Jalandhar, Gurdaspur, Sialkot, Gujrat  (part). In its flora there is a strong infusion of Indo-Malayan  elements. An interesting member of it is the Butea frondosa, a small  tree of the order Leguminosae. It is known by several names, _dhak_,  _chichra_, _palah_, and _palas_. Putting out its large orange-red  flowers in April it ushers in the hot weather. It has a wide range from  Ceylon to Bengal, where it has given its name to the town of Dacca and  the battlefield of Plassy (Palasi). From Bengal it extends all the way  to Hazara. There can be no doubt that a large part of the submontane  region was once _dhak_ forest. Tracts in the north of Karnal--Chachra,  in Jalandhar--Dardhak, and in Gujrat--Palahi, have taken their names  from this tree. It coppices very freely, furnishes excellent firewood  and good timber for the wooden frames on which the masonry cylinders of  wells are reared, it exudes a valuable gum, its flowers yield a dye, and  the dry leaves are eaten by buffaloes. A tree commonly planted near  wells and villages in the submontane tract is the _dhrek_ (Melia  azedarach, N.O. Meliaceae), which is found as far west as Persia and is  often called by English people the Persian lilac. The _bahera_  (Terminalia belerica, N.O. Combretaceae), a much larger tree, is  Indo-Malayan. Common shrubs are the _marwan_ (Vitex negundo, N.O.  Verbenaceae), Plumbago Zeylanica (Plumbaginaceae), the _bansa_ or  _bhekar_ (Adhatoda vasica, N.O. Acanthaceae). The last is Indo-Malayan.  Among herbs Cassias, which do not occur in Europe, are common. The  curious cactus-like Euphorbia Royleana grows abundantly and is used for  making hedges.    ~Sub-Himalaya.~--A large part of the Sub-Himalayan region belongs to the  Siwaliks. The climate is fairly moist and subject to less extremes of  heat and cold than the regions described above. A strong infusion of  Indo-Malayan types is found and a noticeable feature is the large number  of flowering trees and shrubs. Such beautiful flowering trees as the  _simal_ or silk-cotton tree (Bombax Malabaricum, N.O. Malvaceae), the  _amaltas_ (Cassia fistula), Albizzia mollis and Albizzia stipulata,  Erythrina suberosa, Bauhinia purpurea and Bauhinia variegata, all  belonging to the order Leguminosae, are unknown in Europe, but common in  the Indo-Malayan region. This is true also of Oroxylum Indicum (N.O.  Bignoniaceae) with its remarkable long sword-like capsules, and of the  _kamila_ (Mallotus Philippinensis), which abounds in the low hills, but  may escape the traveller's notice as its flowers have no charm of form  or colour. He will in spring hardly fail to observe another Indo-Malayan  tree, the _dhawi_ (Woodfordia floribunda, N.O. Lythraceae) with its  bright red flowers. Shrubs with conspicuous flowers are also common,  among which may be noted species of Clematis, Capparis spinosa, Kydia  calycina, Mimosa rubicaulis, Hamiltonia suaveolens, Caryopteris  Wallichiana, and Nerium Oleander. The latter grows freely in sandy  torrent beds. Rhus cotinus, which reddens the hillsides in May, is a  native also of Syria, Italy, and Southern France. Other trees to be  noticed are a wild pear (Pyrus pashia), the olive (Olea cuspidata), the  _khair_ (Acacia catechu) useful to tanners, the _tun_ (Cedrela toona),  whose wood is often used for furniture, the _dhaman_ (Grewia  oppositifolia, N.O. Tiliaceae), and several species of fig. The most  valuable products however of the forests of the lower hills are the  _chir_ or _chil_ pine (Pinus longifolia), and a giant grass, the bamboo  (Dendrocalamus strictus), which attains a height of from 20 to 40 feet.  Shrubs which grow freely on stony hills are the _sanattha_ or _mendru_  (Dodonaea viscosa, N.O. Sapindaceae), which is a valuable protection  against denudation, as goats pass it by, the _garna_, which is a species  of Carissa, and Plectranthus rugosus. Climbers are common. The great  Hiptage madablota (N.O. Malpighiaceae), the Bauhinia Vahlii or elephant  creeper, and some species of the parasitic Loranthus, deserve mention,  also Acacia caesia, Pueraria tuberosa, Vallaris Heynei, Porana  paniculata, and several vines, especially Vitis lanata with its large  rusty leaves. Characteristic herbs are the sweet-scented Viola patrinii,  the slender milkwort; Polygala Abyssinica, a handsome pea, Vigna  vexillata, a borage, Trichodesma Indicum, a balsam, Impatiens balsamina,  familiar in English gardens, the beautiful delicate little blue  Evolvulus alsinoides, the showy purple convolvulus, Ipomaea hederacea,  and a curious lily, Gloriosa superba.    [Illustration: Fig. 20. Deodars and Hill Temple.]    ~Temperate Himalaya.~--The richest part of the temperate Himalayan flora  is probably in the 7500-10,000 zone. Above 10,000 feet sup-alpine  conditions begin, and at 12,000 feet tree growth becomes very scanty and  the flora is distinctly alpine. The _chir_ pine so common in  sub-Himalayan forests extends up to 6500 feet. At this height and 1000  feet lower the _ban_ oak (Quercus incana), grey on the lower side of the  leaf, which is so common at Simla, abounds. Where the _chil_ stops, the  _kail_ or blue pine (Pinus excelsa), after the _deodar_ the most  valuable product of Himalayan forests, begins. Its zone may be taken as  from 7000 to 9000 feet. To the same zone belong the _kelu_ or _deodar_  (Cedrus Libani), the glossy leaved _mohru_ oak (Quercus dilatata),  whose wood is used for making charcoal, and two small trees of the Heath  order, Rhododendron arborea and Pieris ovalifolia. The former in April  and May lightens up with its bright red flowers the sombre Simla  forests. The _kharshu_ or rusty-leaved oak (Quercus semecarpifolia)  affects a colder climate than its more beautiful glossy-leaved relation,  and may almost be considered sub-alpine. It is common on Hattu, and the  oaks there present a forlorn appearance after rain with funereal"]]]
