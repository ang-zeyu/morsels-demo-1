The storm of the  early night had passed over, and a faint light came into the room from  the waning moon. And then she saw the curtains move, and opened her  mouth to scream, but fear had paralysed her voice, and she lay staring  at the hangings, incapable of movement or sound. As she watched the  curtain she saw it move again, and a shape appeared faintly against the  gloomy background.    The spell was broken. She swung herself out of the opposite side of the  bed, and raced to the door, but the man was before her. Before she could  scream, a big hand gripped her throat and flung her back against the  rail of the bed.    Horrified she stared into the cruel face that leered down at her, and  felt the grip tighten. And then as she looked into the face she saw a  sudden grimace, and sensed the terror in his eyes. The hand relaxed; he  bubbled something thickly and fell sideways against the bed. And now she  saw. A man had come through the doorway, a tall man, with a fair beard  and eyes that danced with insane joy.    He came slowly toward her, wiping on his cuff the long-handled knife  that had sent her assailant to the floor.    He was mad. She knew it instinctively, and remembered in a hazy,  confused way, a paragraph she had read about an escaped lunatic. She  tried to dash past him to the open door, but he caught her in the crook  of his left arm, and pressed her to him, towering head and shoulders  over her.    \"You have no right to sit on a court martial, madam,\" he said with  uncanny politeness, and at that moment the light in the room was  switched on and Jaggs appeared in the doorway, his bearded lips parted  in an ugly grin, a long-barrelled pistol in his left hand.    \"Drop your knife,\" he said, \"or I'll drop you.\"    The mad doctor turned his head slowly and frowned at the intruder.    \"Good morning, General,\" he said calmly. \"You came in time,\" and he  threw the knife on to the ground. \"We will try her according to  regulations!\"          Chapter XV           A TRAGIC AFFAIR IN THE WEST END.         MAD DOCTOR WOUNDS A BURGLAR IN A SOCIETY WOMAN'S BEDROOM.         \"There was an extraordinary and tragic sequel to the escape of       Dr. Thun from Norwood Asylum, particulars of which appeared in       our early edition of yesterday. This morning at four o'clock,       in answer to a telephone call, Detective-Sergeant Miller,       accompanied by another officer, went to 84, Cavendish Mansions,       a flat occupied by Mrs. Meredith, and there found and took into       custody Dr. Algernon Thun, who had escaped from Norwood Asylum.       In the room was also found a man named Hoggins, a person well       known to the police. It appears that Hoggins had effected an       entrance into Mrs. Meredith's flat, descending from the roof by       means of a rope, making his way into the premises through the       window of Mrs. Meredith's bedroom. Whilst there he was detected       by Mrs. Meredith, who would undoubtedly have been murdered had       not Dr. Thun, who, in some mysterious manner, had gained       admission to the flat, intervened. In the struggle that       followed the doctor, who is suffering from the delusion of       persecution, severely wounded the man, who is not expected to       live. He then turned his attention to the lady. Happily an old       man who works at the flat, who was sleeping on the premises at       the time, was roused by the sound of the struggle, and       succeeded in releasing the lady from the maniacal grasp of the       intruder. The wounded burglar was removed to hospital and the       lunatic was taken to the police station and was afterwards sent       under a strong guard to the asylum from whence he had escaped.       He made a rambling statement to the police to the effect that       General Foch had assisted his escape and had directed him to       the home of his persecutors.\"    Jean Briggerland put down the paper and laughed.    \"It is nothing to snigger about,\" growled Briggerland savagely.    \"If I didn't laugh I should do something more emotional,\" said the girl  coolly. \"To think that that fool should go back and make the attempt  single-handed. I never imagined that.\"    \"Faire tells me that he's not expected to live,\" said Mr. Briggerland.  He rubbed his bald head irritably. \"I wonder if that lunatic is going  to talk?\"    \"What does it matter if he does?\" said the girl impatiently.    \"You said the other day----\" he began.    \"The other day it mattered, my dear father. To-day nothing matters very  much. I think we have got well out of it. I ignored all the lessons  which my textbook teaches when I entrusted work to other hands. Jaggs,\"  she said softly.    \"Eh?\" said the father.    \"I'm repeating a well-beloved name,\" she smiled and rose, folding her  serviette. \"I am going for a long run in the country. Would you like to  come? Mordon is very enthusiastic about the new car, the bill for which,  by the way, came in this morning. Have we any money?\"    \"A few thousands,\" said her father, rubbing his chin. \"Jean, we shall  have to sell something unless things brighten.\"    Jean's lips twitched, but she said nothing.    On her way to the open road she called at Cavendish Mansions, and was  neither surprised nor discomfited to discover that Jack Glover was  there.    \"My dear,\" she said, warmly clasping both the girl's hands in hers, \"I  was so shocked when I read the news! How terrible it must have been for  you.\"    Lydia was looking pale, and there were dark shadows under her eyes, but  she treated the matter cheerfully.    \"I've just been trying to explain to Mr. Glover what happened.  Unfortunately, the wonderful Jaggs is not here. He knows more about it  than I, for I collapsed in the most feminine way.\"    \"How did he get in--I mean this madman?\" asked the girl.    \"Through the door.\"    It was Jack who answered.    \"It is the last way in the world a lunatic would enter a flat, isn't it?  He came in with a key, and he was brought here by somebody who struck a  match to make sure it was the right number.\"    \"He might have struck the match himself,\" said Jean, \"but you're so  clever that you would not say a thing like that unless you had proof.\"    \"We found two matches in the hall outside,\" said Jack, \"and when Dr.  Thun was searched no matches were found on him, and I have since learnt  that, like most homicidal lunatics, he had a horror of fire in any form.  The doctor to whom I have been talking is absolutely sure that he would  not have struck the match himself. Oh, by the way, Miss Briggerland,  your father met this unfortunate man. I understand he paid a visit to  the asylum a few days ago?\"    \"Yes, he did,\" she answered without hesitation. \"He was talking about  him this morning. You see, father has been making a tour of the asylums.  He is writing a book about such things. Father was horrified when he  heard the man had escaped, because the doctor told him that he was a  particularly dangerous lunatic. But who would have imagined he would  have turned up here?\"    Her big, sad eyes were fixed on Jack as she shook her head in wonder.    \"If one had read that in a book one would never have believed it, would  one?\"    \"And the man Hoggins,\" said Jack, who did not share her wonder. \"He was  by way of being an acquaintance of yours, a member of your father's  club, wasn't he?\"    She knit her brows.    \"I don't remember the name, but if he is a very bad character,\" she said  with a little smile, \"I should say distinctly that he was a member of  father's club! Poor daddy, I don't think he will ever regenerate the  East End.\"    \"I don't think he will,\" agreed Jack heartily. \"The question is, whether  the East End will ever regenerate him.\"    A slow smile dawned on her face.    \"How unkind!\" she said, mockery in her eyes now. \"I wonder why you  dislike him so. He is so very harmless, really. My dear,\" she turned to  the girl with a gesture of helplessness. \"I am afraid that even in this  affair Mr. Glover is seeing my sinister influence!\"    \"You're the most un-sinister person I have ever met, Jean,\" laughed  Lydia, \"and Mr. Glover doesn't really think all these horrid things.\"    \"Doesn't he?\" said Jean softly, and Jack saw that she was shaking with  laughter.    There was a certain deadly humour in the situation which tickled him  too, and he grinned.    \"I wish to heaven you'd get married and settle down, Miss Briggerland,\"  he said incautiously.    It was her chance. She shook her head, the lips drooped, the eyes again  grew moist with the pain she could call to them at will.    \"I wish I could,\" she said in a tone a little above a whisper, \"but,  Jack, I could never marry you, never!\"    She left Jack Glover bereft of speech, totally incapable of arousing so  much as a moan.    Lydia, returning from escorting her visitor to the door, saw his  embarrassment and checked his impulsive explanation a little coldly.    \"I--I believed you when you said it wasn't true, Mr. Glover,\" she said,  and there was a reproach in her tone for which she hated herself  afterwards.          Chapter XVI      Lydia had promised to go to the theatre that night with Mrs.  Cole-Mortimer, and she was glad of the excuse to leave her tragic home.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer, who was not lavish in the matter of entertainments  that cost money, had a box, and although Lydia had seen the piece before  (it was in fact the very play she had attended to sketch dresses on the  night of her adventure) it was a relief to sit in silence, which her  hostess, with singular discretion, did not attempt to disturb.    It was during the last act that Mrs. Cole-Mortimer gave her an  invitation which she accepted joyfully.    \"I've got a house at Cap Martin,\" said Mrs. Cole-Mortimer. \"It is only a  tiny place, but I think you would rather like it.

(#14)"],[1,"d,  suitable for frames over 1-1/4 in. in thickness. The loose tongue-slip  is glued into the right-hand door frame.    Fig. 266 shows a shutting joint used to prevent permeation of dust to the  interior of a drawer. The drawer front is grooved and engages a  suitably-formed slip which is screwed to the bearer as indicated in the  illustration. Occasionally some difficulty is experienced when fitting  the slip to a narrow drawer, but this can always be overcome by putting  in the screws from the top of the bearer instead of from underneath.    [Illustration: Fig. 266.--Dust-proof Drawer, showing the Front grooved to  engage a Slip which is screwed to the Bearer Rail.]    Shutting joints which are required to be \"light-tight,\" such as those  used in photographic work, are generally formed by slightly grooving the  frame and inserting a strip of black velvet. The friction of the high  pile of the velvet prevents the filtration of light through the joint.    When making air-tight showcases, one of the best and simplest tests is to  place a lighted candle in the case and close all the doors; if the candle  goes out within three minutes you have accomplished your object.          THE DOVETAIL JOINT      Nothing definite is known as to the origin of dovetailing, but a quaint  and pleasing little story which is well worth repeating runs as follows:  A farmer had called in the local \"joyner\" to do sundry repairs at the  homestead. One day, whilst enjoying a humble meal, he sat watching some  doves as they hopped about the yard. Struck by the movement of their  wedge-shaped tails, it occurred to him to joint his timber by the  interlocking method; hence we have _dovetails_.    [Illustration: Fig. 267.--A Single Through Dovetail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 268.--Through Dovetails on Carcase Work (P, Pins; T,  Tails).]    THROUGH DOVETAILING.--One of the simplest forms of the dovetail joint is  shown in Fig. 267, where two pieces of timber are joined by the method  known as \"through\" dovetailing. This method is used in everyday practice  for joining the corners of frames, bracket trusses, and a hundred and one  other articles.    Figs. 268 and 269 show the method of through dovetailing as applied to  the making of boxes, plinths, and general carcase work; it is used in  positions where no objection can be taken to the end grain showing on  each side of the finished work. In the case of plinths and furniture  cornices the foundation frame is made of yellow pine or other cheap wood,  and the more expensive and rare timbers are glued and mitred around in  various thicknesses and shapes, thus saving the more costly material and  strengthening the construction by the method known as laminating. In many  cases all that is necessary is to veneer the face sides, thus covering  and hiding any unsightliness.    [Illustration: Fig. 269.--Dovetails for Boxes, etc.]    [Illustration: Fig. 270.--Lap-dovetailing for Drawers.]    LAP-DOVETAILING.--Fig. 270 is an example of lap-dovetailing, such as is  used where a drawer side joins with the drawer front. It is not  permissible to allow the end grain of the timber to show at the front of  a drawer, and this is why resort is had to the lap-dovetail. As the most  general use of the dovetail is for this and similar purposes, we shall  therefore deal fully with the methods of marking out and the making of  this class of joint.    ANGLES.--A most important point in the construction of a dovetail is to  avoid having the angles of the pins and tails too acute. An inclination  of one in eight is considered correct; no hard and fast rule need be  obeyed, but the variation should on no account be less than one in six.    [Illustration: Fig. 271.--How to obtain Correct Angles for Dovetail  Template.]    [Illustration: Fig. 272.--Squaring and use of Template.]    Fig. 271 shows a simple method to obtain the correct angle. Take a piece  of timber and plane up the face edge (A, B) true and straight; mark out a  line (C, D) at right angles to the face edge and space off 8 ins. as  shown; now measure a distance of 1 in. (D, E), and join E to point eight.  This will give the correct angle for the dovetails, and it may then be  transferred to the joiners' bevel. Many workers who are constantly on  dovetail work make a zinc template to the exact angle and keep it  specially for the purpose (Fig. 272).    SQUARING.--Another important point to remember is that the drawer sides  must be true and squared to an exact length and planed up to thickness;  otherwise the finished drawer will be in winding and out of truth.    To true and square the ends of drawer sides, drawer backs and drawer  front, a most useful little machine is the mitre trimmer; failing this,  excellent results can be obtained by using the shooting board.    [Illustration: Fig. 273.--Method of Marking with Cutting Gauge.]    GAUGING.--After squaring up the timber accurate gauging of the ends is  another important point. The gauge used should be a cutting gauge, so  that the line is incised about 1/32 in. in depth, thus effectually  cutting the cross fibres of the timber.    Fig. 273 shows the method of using the cutting gauge. The stock of the  gauge must be held well up to the end of the timber. The gauge is a most  difficult tool for the novice to use, and his trouble is generally caused  by holding it too flat. Tilt the gauge a little so that the thumbscrew  shown in the illustration goes nearer to the floor; the blade will then  not bite so keenly, and better results will be obtained. The dotted lines  indicate the positions which the dovetails will occupy when marked out.    The gauge is set a trifle less than the thickness of the drawer sides to  allow for the thickness of the steel cutter, and a gauge line is marked  on the inside of the front and all round the drawer back. The gauge is  now readjusted so as to leave a 1/4-in. lap on the front, and a line  marked on the ends of the front and all round the ends of the sides which  will engage the drawer front. A glance at Figs. 270 and 273 will make  this clear.    [Illustration: Fig. 274.--Removing the Waste Wood.]    The dovetail pins on drawer part and back are spaced out and marked on  the end with the aid of the joiners' bevel, the lines being then squared  down to the gauge line by the method shown at Fig. 272--that is, by  using the try-square and marking awl.    The drawer front is now put into the bench vice, and the pins are cut as  indicated in Fig. 274. The drawer back is treated in a similar manner,  but of course in this case it is not \"lap\" but \"through\" dovetailing, and  the saw kerf goes through the timber and down to the gauge line.    [Illustration: Fig. 275.--Cutting away the Half Dovetails.]    We now come to the point where it is necessary to remove the superfluous  material. Fig. 274 shows a method commonly adopted and known as sawing  out the waste; the saw is held at an angle and part of the inside portion  of the dovetail is cut away as shown. This is a good plan for the  amateur, because it shows him at the commencement of his chopping out  which will be the pin and which the tail.    [Illustration: Fig. 276.--Showing the Vertical and Horizontal Chisel  Operations in Lap-dovetailing. A: The Preliminary Roughing-out. B:  Vertical Chiselling; note that the first stab should be just outside the  Gauge Line. C: Marking the Horizontal Cut.]    Fig. 276 (A) shows another method that answers well for soft woods such  as pine, American whitewood and satin walnut. The drawer front is laid  flat on the bench after it has been sawn, and with a mallet and sharp  chisel the corner of the dovetail is knocked off as shown. This takes the  bulk of the material away and the dovetail is then pared out square in  the usual way. The illustration (Fig. 276) also shows how the chisel is  held for vertical paring (B) and for horizontal paring (C).    [Illustration: Fig. 277.--Roughing-out by Boring.]    [Illustration: Fig. 278.--Marking Pins on Drawer Side.]    A third method is shown at Fig. 277. With hard, curly timbers, such as  tobacco mahogany and satinwood, it is a laborious process to carefully  chop away the timber in small pieces, and to overcome this difficulty we  occasionally see the workman take a twist-bit and bore a series of holes  as shown. A great portion of the timber may then be split away by  inserting the chisel end-way into the grain, after which it is pared to a  finish.    As dovetailing is chiefly used for drawer making, it will be of interest  to give several illustrations of variations of the joint and its uses.    Fig. 278 indicates the method of marking the position of the holes in  the drawer side. When the paring out of the dovetails is completed the  drawer front is turned over on to the side as shown, and the position of  the recesses which will engage the pin portions are marked with the  marking awl as illustrated.    [Illustration: Fig. 279.--Marking by means of Saw Blade.]    [Illustration: Fig. 280.--Gauge Lines, Scores and Saw Cuts.]    [Illustration: Fig. 281.--Sawing the Drawer Side.]    [Illustration: Fig. 282.--Position of Chisel for Cutting Channel.]    The completed drawer back is marked on the sides in an exactly similar  manner.    Another method of marking through dovetails is shown at Fig 279. The side  is held in position on the end, and the dovetail saw is inserted and  drawn out of the saw kerf, thus leaving the exact mark on the  drawer-back.    Other workers prefer a pounce-bag instead of a saw. A pounce-bag consists  of a piece of fairly open woven muslin filled with a mixture of French  chalk and finely-powdered whiting; the muslin is tied up with a piece of  thin twine like the mouth of a flour sack. All that is necessary is to  place the timber in position and bang the bag on the top of the saw-cuts,  when sufficient powder will pass through the bag and down the saw kerf to  mark the exact positions of the lines.
