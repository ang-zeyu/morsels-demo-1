Very early there came two ship-loads of Dutch  Calvinists from New York, dissatisfied with the domineering of their  English victors. But more important than the rest was that sudden  outflow of French Huguenots, representing not only religious fidelity  and devotion, but all those personal and social virtues that most  strengthen the foundations of a state, which set westward upon the  revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. This, with the later influx  of the Scotch-Irish, profoundly marked the character of South Carolina.  The great names in her history are generally either French or Scotch.    It ought to have been plain to the proprietors, in their monstrous  conceit of political wisdom, that communities so constituted should have  been the last on which to impose the uniformity of an established  church. John Locke did see this, but was overruled. The Church of  England was established in name, but for long years had only this shadow  of existence. We need not, however, infer from the absence of organized  church and official clergy among the rude and turbulent pioneers of  North Carolina that the kingdom of God was not among them, even from the  beginning. But not until the year 1672 do we find manifestation of it  such as history can recognize. In that year came William Edmundson, \"the  voice of one crying in the wilderness,\" bringing his testimony of the  light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. The honest  man, who had not thought it reasonable in the Christians of  Massachusetts to be offended at one's sitting in the steeple-house with  his hat on, found it an evidence that \"they had little or no religion\"  when the rough woodsmen of Carolina beguiled the silent moments of the  Friends' devotions by smoking their pipes; and yet he declares that he  found them \"a tender people.\" Converts were won to the society, and a  quarterly meeting was established. Within a few months followed George  Fox, uttering his deep convictions in a voice of singular persuasiveness  and power, that reached the hearts of both high and low. And he too  declared that he had found the people \"generally tender and open,\" and  rejoiced to have made among them \"a little entrance for truth.\" The  church of Christ had been begun. As yet there had been neither baptism  nor sacramental supper; these outward and visible signs were absent; but  inward and spiritual grace was there, and the thing signified is greater  than the sign. The influence diffused itself like leaven. Within a  decade the society was extended through both the Carolinas and became  the principal form of organized Christianity. It was reckoned in 1710 to  include one seventh of the population of North Carolina.[65:1]    The attempt of a foreign proprietary government to establish by law the  church of an inconsiderable and not preeminently respectable minority  had little effect except to exasperate and alienate the settlers. Down  to the end of the seventeenth century the official church in North  Carolina gave no sign of life. In South Carolina almost twenty years  passed before it was represented by a single clergyman. The first  manifestation of church life seems to have been in the meetings on the  banks of the Cooper and the Santee, in which the French refugees  worshiped their fathers' God with the psalms of Marot and Beza.    But with the eighteenth century begins a better era for the English  church in the Carolinas. The story of the founding and the work of the  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, taken in  connection with its antecedents and its results, belongs to this  history, not only as showing the influence of European Christianity upon  America, but also as indicating the reaction of America upon Europe.    In an important sense the organization of religious societies which is  characteristic of modern Christendom is of American origin. The labors  of John Eliot among the Indians of New England stirred so deep an  interest in the hearts of English Christians that in 1649 an ordinance  was passed by the Long Parliament creating a corporation to be called  \"The President and Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New  England\"; and a general collection made under Cromwell's direction  produced nearly twelve thousand pounds, from the income of which  missionaries were maintained among some of the Northern tribes of  Indians. With the downfall of the Commonwealth the corporation became  defunct; but through the influence of the saintly Richard Baxter, whose  tender interest in the work of Eliot is witnessed by a touching passage  in his writings, the charter was revived in 1662, with Robert Boyle for  president and patron. It was largely through his generosity that Eliot  was enabled to publish his Indian Bible. This society, \"The New England  Company,\" as it is called, is still extant--the oldest of Protestant  missionary societies.[66:1]    It is to that Dr. Thomas Bray who returned in 1700 to England from his  thankless and discouraging work as commissary in Maryland of the Bishop  of London, that the Church of England owes a large debt of gratitude for  having taken away the reproach of her barrenness. Already his zeal had  laid the foundations on which was reared the Society for the Promotion  of Christian Knowledge. In 1701 he had the satisfaction of attending the  first meeting of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in  Foreign Parts, which for nearly three quarters of a century, sometimes  in the spirit of a narrow sectarianism, but not seldom in a more  excellent way, devoted its main strength to missions in the American  colonies. Its missionaries, men of a far different character from the  miserable incumbents of parishes in Maryland and Virginia, were among  the first preachers of the gospel in the Carolinas. Within the years  1702-40 there served under the commission of this society in North  Carolina nine missionaries, in South Carolina thirty-five.[67:1]    But the zeal of these good men was sorely encumbered with the armor of  Saul. Too much favorable legislation and patronizing from a foreign  proprietary government, too arrogant a tone of superiority on the part  of official friends, attempts to enforce conformity by imposing  disabilities on other sects--these were among the chief occasions of the  continual collision between the people and the colonial governments,  which culminated in the struggle for independence. By the time that  struggle began the established church in the Carolinas was ready to  vanish away.      FOOTNOTES:    [55:1] W. H. Browne, \"Maryland\" (in American Commonwealths), p. 18.    [57:1] This seems to be the whole explanation of the curious paradox  that the first experiment of religious liberty and equality before the  law among all Christian sects should have been made apparently under the  auspices of that denomination which alone at the present day continues  to maintain in theory that it is the duty of civil government to enforce  sound doctrine by pains and penalties. We would not grudge the amplest  recognition of Lord Baltimore's faith or magnanimity or political  wisdom; but we have failed to find evidence of his rising above the  plane of the smart real-estate speculator, willing to be all things to  all men, if so he might realize on his investments. Happily, he was  clear-sighted enough to perceive that his own interest was involved in  the liberty, contentment, and prosperity of his colonists.    Mr. E. D. Neill, who has excelled other writers in patient and exact  study of the original sources of this part of colonial history,  characterizes Cecilius, second Lord Baltimore, as \"one whose whole life  was passed in self-aggrandizement, first deserting Father White, then  Charles I., and making friends of Puritans and republicans to secure the  rentals of the province of Maryland, and never contributing a penny for  a church or school-house\" (\"English Colonization of America,\" p. 258).

When the Englishman Henry Hudson, in the Dutch East India Company's  ship, the \"Half-moon,\" in September, 1609, sailed up \"the River of  Mountains\" as far as the site of Albany, looking for the northwest  passage to China, the English settlement at Jamestown was in the third  year of its half-perishing existence. More than thirteen years were yet  to pass before the Pilgrims from England by way of Holland should make  their landing on Plymouth Rock.    But we are not at liberty to assign so early a date to the Dutch  settlement of New York, and still less to the church. There was a prompt  reaching out, on the part of the immensely enterprising Dutch merchants,  after the lucrative trade in peltries; there was a plying to and fro of  trading-vessels, and there were trading-posts established on Manhattan  Island and at the head of navigation on the Hudson, or North River, and  on the South River, or Delaware. Not until the great Dutch West India  Company had secured its monopoly of trade and perfected its  organization, in 1623, was there a beginning of colonization. In that  year a company of Walloons, or French-speaking Hollanders,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#14)"],[1,"ted. Bishop Barrington died in London, in his  ninety-third year.    #William Van Mildert# (1826-1836), Bishop of Llandaff, succeeded to  the see. During his episcopate, many important changes were made. The  Ecclesiastical Commission, appointed in 1833, to consider in what manner  the funds of the Church might be made more available for the purposes  for which they were intended, decided to give future bishops a fixed  yearly payment, and to reduce the number of canons from twelve to six.  On the appointment of a new bishop, the Palatinate was to be annexed by  the State. Thus Van Mildert was the last Count Palatine. Before these  changes came into force, however, the bishop and the dean and chapter  founded and endowed the university out of the revenues of the see, for  the use of which the bishop gave up the castle. Bishop Van Mildert was a  man of great charity, and though his income was immense, he died  comparatively poor. He died in February 1836, and was interred in the  chapel of the Nine Altars.    #Edward Maltby# (1836-1856), his successor, was translated from  Chichester, and held the see for twenty years, when, owing to advanced  age and increasing infirmity, he resigned in 1856.    #Charles Thomas Longley# (1856-1860), first Bishop of Ripon, was next  elected. He was a popular and much-beloved prelate. In 1860 he was  created Archbishop of York, and two years later was translated to  Canterbury.    #Hon. Henry Montague Villiers# (1860-1861) was translated from  Carlisle. A fine preacher, his episcopate was all too short. He died,  after much suffering, in 1861.    #Charles Baring# (1861-1878), Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol,  succeeded him. A man of unbounded charity and goodness, he won the  affection of all who knew him personally. He was compelled, through  illness, to resign the see in 1878, and did not long survive his  retirement.    #Joseph Barber Lightfoot# (1879-1889) was then elected to the see. A  man of scholarly attainments, he is still too well known and remembered  to need any detailed note. He came to Durham pledged to accomplish as  soon as possible the division of the diocese, which promise he carried  out by restoring the suppressed see of Hexham to Newcastle-on-Tyne. A  fine tomb to the memory of Dr Lightfoot has been placed on the north  side of the choir of the cathedral, and as a memorial of his episcopate  the mutilated chapter-house has been restored.    The present bishop is the #Right Rev. Brooke Foss Westcott, D.D.#           *       *       *       *       *    In this place may conveniently be given the rough draft of the  settlement of the see by King Henry VIII. at the Reformation. Although  departed from in many instances, it throws a curious light on the king's  intentions to keep up some semblance of a conventual institution with an  active educational purpose.
