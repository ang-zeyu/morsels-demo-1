A little later I was  awakened again by the same animal, or another, which I repelled as  before. At intervals during the rest of the night they visited me in  this way; my sleep was by short stages from one porcupine to another.    These animals are great gnawers. They seem to be specially fond of  gnawing any tool or object that has been touched or used by human hands.  They would probably have gnawed my shoes or lunch basket or staff had I  lain still. A settler at the foot of the mountain told me they used to  prove very annoying to him by getting into his cellar or woodshed at  night, and indulging their ruling passion by chewing upon his  tool-handles or pails or harness. \"Kick one of them outdoors,\" he said,  \"and in half an hour he is back again.\" In winter they usually live in  trees, gnawing the bark and feeding upon the inner layer. I have seen  large hemlocks quite denuded and killed in this way.          XII    THE OPOSSUM      A new track has appeared upon the snow in my neighborhood here on the  Hudson within the past few years. It is a strange track, and suggests  some small, deformed human hand. If the dwarfs or brownies we read of in  childhood were to walk abroad in winter, they might leave such an  imprint behind them as this.    This track, which we seldom see later than December, is made by the  opossum. This animal is evidently multiplying in the land, and is  extending its range northward. Ten years ago they were rarely found  here, and now they are very common. I hear that they are very abundant  and troublesome on parts of Long Island. The hind foot of the opossum  has a sort of thumb that opposes the other toes, and it is the imprint  of this member that looks so strange. The under side of the foot is as  naked as the human hand, and this adds to the novel look of the track in  the snow.    Late in the fall, my hired man set a trap in a hole in hopes of catching  a skunk, but instead he caught a possum by one of its fore feet. The  poor thing was badly crippled, and he kept it in a barrel for a couple  of weeks and fed it, to try and make amends for the injury he had done.  Then he gave it its freedom, though the injured foot had healed but  little.    Soon after he set his trap in the same hole, and to his annoyance caught  the possum again, this time by one of the hind feet. He brought the  quiet, uncomplaining creature to me by its prehensile tail, and asked me  what should be done with or for it. I concluded to make a hospital for  it in one corner of my study. I made it a nest behind a pile of  magazines, and fed and nursed it for several weeks. It never made a  sound, or showed the least uneasiness or sign of suffering, that I was  aware of, in all that time. By day it slept curled up in its nest. If  disturbed, it did not \"play possum,\" that is, did not feign sleep or  death, but opened its mouth and grinned up at you in a sort of comical,  idiotic way. At night it hobbled about the study, and ate the meat and  cake I had placed for it. Sometimes by day it would come out of the  corner and eat food under the lounge, eating very much after the manner  of a pig, though not so greedily. Indeed, all its motions were very  slow, like those of the skunk.    The skin of the opossum is said to be so fetid that a dog will not touch  it. A dog is always suspicious of an animal that shows no fear and makes  no attempt to get out of his way. This fetidness of the opossum is not  apparent to my sense.    After a while my patient began to be troublesome by climbing upon the  book-shelves and inspecting the books, so I concluded to discharge him  from the hospital. One night I carried him to the open door by his tail,  put him down upon the door-sill, and told him to go forth. He hesitated,  looked back into the warm room, then out into the winter night, then  thought of his maimed feet, and of traps in holes where unsuspecting  possums live, and could not reach a decision. \"Come,\" I said, \"I have  done all I can for you; go forth and shift for yourself.\" Slowly, like a  very old man, he climbed down out of the door and disappeared in the  darkness. I have no doubt he regained his freedom with a sigh. It is  highly probable that, if a trap is set in his way again, he will put his  foot in it as innocently as before.    [Illustration: OPOSSUM]    One day in March one of my neighbors brought to me a handful of young  possums, very young, sixteen of them, like newly born mice. The mother  had been picked up dead on the railroad, killed, as so often happens to  coons, foxes, muskrats, and woodchucks, by the night express. The young  were in her pouch, each clinging to its teat, dead. The young are  carried and nursed by the mothers in this curious pocket till they are  four or five weeks old, or of the size of large mice. After this she  frequently carries them about, clinging to various parts of her body,  some with their tails wound around hers.    The next winter, two or more possums and a skunk took up their quarters  under my study floor. It was not altogether a happy family. Just what  their disagreements were about, I do not know, but the skunk evidently  tried to roast the possums out. The possums stood it better than I  could. I came heartily to wish they were all roasted out. I was  beginning to devise ways and means, when I think the skunk took himself  off. After that, my only annoyance was from the quarreling of the  possums among themselves, and their ceaseless fussing around under  there, both day and night. At times they made sounds as if they were  scratching matches on the under side of the floor: then they seemed to  be remaking or shifting their beds from one side to the other. Sometimes  I think they snored in their sleep. One night, as I was going from the  house to the study, I heard a rustling in the dry leaves and grass,  beside the path. Lighting a match, I approached the spot, and found one  of the possums just setting out on his night's excursions. I stooped  down and stroked his head and scratched his back, but he did not move;  he only opened his mouth a little and looked silly.          XIII    WILD MICE      One of the prettiest and most abundant of our native mice is the deer  mouse, also called the white-footed mouse; a very beautiful creature,  nocturnal in his habits, with large ears, and large, fine eyes full of a  wild, harmless look. He is daintily marked, with white feet and a white  belly. When disturbed by day he is very easily captured, having none of  the cunning or viciousness of the common Old World mouse. He is found in  both fields and woods.    It is he who, high in the hollow trunk of some tree, lays by a store of  beech-nuts for winter use. Every nut is carefully shelled, and the  cavity that serves as storehouse lined with grass and leaves. The  wood-chopper frequently squanders this precious store. I have seen half  a peck taken from one tree, as clean and white as if put up by the most  delicate hands,--as they were. How long it must have taken the little  creature to collect this quantity, to hull them one by one, and convey  them up to his fifth-story chamber!    But the deer mice do not always carry their supplies home in this  manner; they often hide them in the nearest convenient place. I have  known them to carry a pint or more of hickory nuts and deposit them in a  pair of boots standing in the chamber of an outhouse. Near the  chestnut-trees they will fill little pocket-like depressions in the  ground with chestnuts; in a grain-field they carry the grain under  stones; under some cover beneath cherry-trees they collect great numbers  of cherry-pits. Hence, when cold weather comes, instead of staying at  home like the chipmunk, they gad about hither and thither looking up  their supplies. One may see their tracks on the snow everywhere in the  woods and fields and by the roadside. The advantage of this way of  living is that it leads to activity, and probably to sociability.    [Illustration: WHITE-FOOTED MOUSE]    One day, on my walk in the woods, I saw at one point the mice-tracks  unusually thick around a small sugar-maple. It was doubtless their  granary; they had beech-nuts stored there, I'll warrant. There were two  entrances to the cavity of the tree,--one at the base, and one seven or  eight feet up. At the upper one, which was only just of the size of a  mouse, a squirrel had been trying to break in. He had cut and chiseled  the solid wood to the depth of nearly an inch, and his chips strewed  the snow all about. He knew what was in there, and the mice knew that he  knew; hence their apparent consternation. They had rushed wildly about  over the snow, and, I doubt not, had given the piratical red squirrel a  piece of their minds. A few yards away the mice had a hole down into the  snow, which perhaps led to some snug den under the ground. Hither they  may have been slyly removing their stores while the squirrel was at work  with his back turned. One more night and he would effect an entrance:  what a good joke upon him if he found the cavity empty! These native  mice, I imagine, have to take many precautions to prevent their winter  stores being plundered by the squirrels, who live, as it were, from hand  to mouth.    The wild mice are fond of bees and of honey, and they apparently like  nothing better than to be allowed to take up their quarters in winter in  some vacant space in a hive of bees. A chamber just over the bees seems  to be preferred, as here they get the benefit of the warmth generated by  the insects. One very cold winter I wrapped up one of my hives with a  shawl. Before long I noticed that the shawl was beginning to have a very  torn and tattered appearance. On examination, I found that a native  mouse had established itself in the top of the hive, and had levied a  ruinous tax upon the shawl to make itself a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2439"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"those passions, and quicksighted rather than farsighted. He  wanted more power and more money. More power he could obtain only at  Rochester's expense; and the obvious way to obtain power at Rochester's  expense was to encourage the dislike which the King felt for Rochester's  moderate counsels. Money could be most easily and most largely obtained  from the court of Versailles; and Sunderland was eager to sell himself  to that court. He had no jovial generous vices. He cared little for wine  or for beauty: but he desired riches with an ungovernable and insatiable  desire. The passion for play raged in him without measure, and had not  been tamed by ruinous losses. His hereditary fortune was ample. He had  long filled lucrative posts, and had neglected no art which could make  them more lucrative: but his ill luck at the hazard table was such that  his estates were daily becoming more and more encumbered. In the hope of  extricating himself from his embarrassments, he betrayed to Barillon all  the schemes adverse to France which had been meditated in the English  cabinet, and hinted that a Secretary of State could in such times  render services for which it might be wise in Lewis to pay largely. The  Ambassador told his master that six thousand guineas was the smallest  gratification that could be offered to so important a minister. Lewis  consented to go as high as twenty-five thousand crowns, equivalent to  about five thousand six hundred pounds sterling. It was agreed that  Sunderland should receive this sum yearly, and that he should, in  return, exert all his influence to prevent the reassembling of the  Parliament. [59] He joined himself therefore to the Jesuitical cabal,  and made so dexterous an use of the influence of that cabal that he  was appointed to succeed Halifax in the high dignity of Lord President  without being required to resign the far more active and lucrative post  of Secretary. [60] He felt, however, that he could never hope to obtain  paramount influence in the court while he was supposed to belong to  the Established Church. All religions were the same to him. In private  circles, indeed, he was in the habit of talking with profane contempt of  the most sacred things. He therefore determined to let the King have the  delight and glory of effecting a conversion. Some management, however,  was necessary. No man is utterly without regard for the opinion of  his fellow creatures; and even Sunderland, though not very sensible to  shame, flinched from the infamy of public apostasy. He played his part  with rare adroitness. To the world he showed himself as a Protestant. In  the royal closet he assumed the character of an earnest inquirer after  truth, who was almost persuaded to declare himself a Roman Catholic, and  who, while waiting for fuller illumination, was disposed to render every  service in his power to the professors of the old faith. James, who  was never very discerning, and who in religious matters was absolutely  blind, suffered himself, notwithstanding all that he had seen of human  knavery, of the knavery of courtiers as a class, and of the knavery of  Sunderland in particular, to be duped into the belief that divine grace  had touched the most false and callous of human hearts. During many  months the wily minister continued to be regarded at court as a  promising catechumen, without exhibiting himself to the public in the  character of a renegade. [61]    He early suggested to the King the expediency of appointing a secret  committee of Roman Catholics to advise on all matters affecting the  interests of their religion. This committee met sometimes at Chiffinch's  lodgings, and sometimes at the official apartments of Sunderland,  who, though still nominally a Protestant, was admitted to all its  deliberations, and soon obtained a decided ascendency over the other  members. Every Friday the Jesuitical cabal dined with the Secretary. The  conversation at table was free; and the weaknesses of the prince whom  the confederates hoped to manage were not spared. To Petre Sunderland  promised a Cardinal's hat; to Castelmaine a splendid embassy to Rome;  to Dover a lucrative command in the Guards; and to Tyrconnel high  employment in Ireland. Thus hound together by the strongest ties of  interest, these men addressed themselves to the task of subverting the  Treasurer's power. [62]    There were two Protestant members of the cabinet who took no decided  part in the struggle. Jeffreys was at this time tortured by a cruel  internal malady which had been aggravated by intemperance. At a dinner  which a wealthy Alderman gave to some of the leading members of the  government, the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Chancellor were so drunk  that they stripped themselves almost stark naked, and were with  difficulty prevented from climbing up a signpost to drink His Majesty's  health. The pious Treasurer escaped with nothing but the scandal of the  debauch: but the Chancellor brought on a violent fit of his complaint.  His life was for some time thought to be in serious danger. James  expressed great uneasiness at the thought of losing a minister who  suited him so well, and said, with some truth, that the loss of such a  man could not be easily repaired. Jeffreys, when he became convalescent,  promised his support to both the contending parties, and waited to  see which of them would prove victorious. Some curious proofs of his  duplicity are still extant. It has been already said that the two French  agents who were then resident in London had divided the English court  between them. Bonrepaux was constantly with Rochester; and Barillon  lived with Sunderland. Lewis was informed in the same week by Bonrepaux  that the Chancellor was entirely with the Treasurer, and by Barillon  that the Chancellor was in league with the Secretary. [63]    Godolphin, cautious and taciturn, did his best to preserve neutrality.  His opinions and wishes were undoubtedly with Rochester; but his office  made it necessary for him to be in constant attendance on the Queen; and  he was naturally unwilling to be on bad terms with her. There is indeed  reason to believe that he regarded her with an attachment more  romantic than often finds place in the hearts of veteran statesmen;  and circumstances, which it is now necessary to relate, had thrown her  entirely into the hands of the Jesuitical cabal. [64]    The King, stern as was his temper and grave as was his deportment, was  scarcely less under the influence of female attractions than his  more lively and amiable brother had been. The beauty, indeed, which  distinguished the favourite ladies of Charles was not necessary to  James. Barbara Palmer, Eleanor Gwynn, and Louisa de Querouaille were  among the finest women of their time. James, when young, had surrendered  his liberty, descended below his rank, and incurred the displeasure of  his family for the coarse features of Anne Hyde. He had soon, to the  great diversion of the whole court, been drawn away from his plain  consort by a plainer mistress, Arabella Churchill. His second wife,  though twenty years younger than himself, and of no unpleasing face or  figure, had frequent reason to complain of his inconstancy. But of  all his illicit attachments the strongest was that which bound him to  Catharine Sedley.    This woman was the daughter of Sir Charles Sedley, one of the most  brilliant and profligate wits of the Restoration. The licentiousness of  his writings is not redeemed by much grace or vivacity; but the charms  of his conversation were acknowledged even by sober men who had no  esteem for his character. To sit near him at the theatre, and to hear  his criticisms on a new play, was regarded as a privilege. [65] Dryden  had done him the honour to make him a principal interlocutor in the  Dialogue on Dramatic Poesy. The morals of Sedley were such as, even in  that age, gave great scandal. He on one occasion, after a wild revel,  exhibited himself without a shred of clothing in the balcony of a  tavern near Covent Garden, and harangued the people who were passing in  language so indecent and profane that he was driven in by a shower of  brickbats, was prosecuted for a misdemeanour, was sentenced to a heavy  fine, and was reprimanded by the Court of King's Bench in the most  cutting terms. [66] His daughter had inherited his abilities and his  impudence. Personal charms she had none, with the exception of two  brilliant eyes, the lustre of which, to men of delicate taste, seemed  fierce and unfeminine. Her form was lean, her countenance haggard.  Charles, though he liked her conversation, laughed at her ugliness, and  said that the priests must have recommended her to his brother by way of  penance. She well knew that she was not handsome, and jested freely on  her own homeliness. Yet, with strange inconsistency, she loved to  adorn herself magnificently, and drew on herself much keen ridicule  by appearing in the theatre and the ring plastered, painted, clad in  Brussels lace, glittering with diamonds, and affecting all the graces of  eighteen. [67]    The nature of her influence over James is not easily to be explained. He  was no longer young. He was a religious man; at least he was willing  to make for his religion exertions and sacrifices from which the great  majority of those who are called religious men would shrink. It seems  strange that any attractions should have drawn him into a course of life  which he must have regarded as highly criminal; and in this case  none could understand where the attraction lay. Catharine herself was  astonished by the violence of his passion. \"It cannot be my beauty,\" she  said; \"for he must see that I have none; and it cannot be my wit, for he  has not enough to know that I have any.\"    At the moment of the King's accession a sense of the new responsibility  which lay on him made his mind for a time peculiarly open to religious  impressions. He formed and"]]]
