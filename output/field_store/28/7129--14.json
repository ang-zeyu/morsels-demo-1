'Good gracious,' he exclaims, 'I'm not going to  read stuff like that; I should get the hump for a week; give me something  cheerful.' And he picks up 'The Bauble,' by Mrs. Risquet Trashe.    And he is quite right. To anyone whose literature has consisted for years  of nothing but novels of the circulating library type, a sudden  application to the great writers would indeed be depressing. Is it  necessary, however, or indeed wise, that any man's mental pabulum should  consist entirely of novels? Nothing is further from my mind than to decry  the taste for novel-reading; for, wisely employed, novels can become one  of the joys of life. One can but agree with Miss Austen when she  inveighs, in 'Northanger Abbey,' against those who belittle the  productions of the novelist. But would she have been so emphatic had she  lived to witness the printing-presses spouting forth that frothy flood  which effervesces round the more serious writings of to-day? Would that  every novel we take up had the delightful 'genius, wit, and taste' of  Jane Austen to recommend it. How few and far between are the really good  novels that we read!    There can be no finer recreation for a tired mind than a good novel.  There is, however, one habit of reading which has become almost a social  evil; and that is the habit of reading newspapers which many indulge in,  morning, noon, and night. It is difficult to imagine anything more  calculated to destroy consecutive and considered thought than the  enormous variety of inconsequential topics that assails one every time  one opens a newspaper. The mind becomes completely fuddled with the  heterogeneous patchwork of entirely useless information. The only method  I have discovered by which one can acquire the important news and yet  retain the serenity of one's mind is that of having such news only as she  knows will be of use read out by one's wife at breakfast. And this does  not mean that the mental discomforts of the newspaper are relegated to  one's better-half, for women are usually interested in the smaller  details of everyday life.    No wonder that a large number of 'city men' live out their lives without  ever opening a book that is worth reading meditatively; for  newspaper-reading in course of time must completely undermine one's  mental stability. After a few years, a book that is not composed of  headlines, short chapters, small paragraphs and ejaculatory sentences, is  unreadable without mental effort. So that long before he is middle-aged  the city man has acquired the habit of 'glancing at' a news-sheet or  magazine whenever he has nothing to do for a few minutes: a kind of  reading that is about as advantageous to the mind as that which we  indulge in when fingering the antique periodicals in the dentist's  waiting-room. In later years he may or he may not overcome the repugnance  he has acquired to anything deep or 'solid' (by which he generally means  'unparagraphed'): but I venture to think that, having once taken the  plunge, there must be moments when he marvels at his foolishness in not  having entered, years before, the City of the golden streets.    Perhaps it is unwise to use the word 'education' in speaking of the  benefits to be derived from reading the great books, for to many people  the term is synonymous with 'school,' where one is obliged frequently to  do things against one's will. Good books, that is the books that 'live,'  are no mere education, they are steps up the path of civilisation itself.  They are just as necessary for the advancement of knowledge as are the  letters and numerals which we learnt at school. The greatest books of the  world do _not_ teach us; _they help us to teach ourselves_, a very  different matter. 'They are masters who instruct us without rod or  ferule,' wrote an early book-lover[24]; 'if you approach them they are  not asleep; if you inquire of them they do not withdraw themselves; they  never chide when you make mistakes; they never laugh if you are  ignorant.' And the books which would be available to him would be chiefly  the works of the Early Fathers, professedly books of moral instruction.  But the books of our library 'are so many faithful and serviceable  friends, gently teaching us everything through their persuasive and wise  experience.'[25]    And that is precisely the point. Good books do not instruct us so much as  they persuade us; so that we come to be of the same mind as the great man  who had deliberated and debated the matter so thoroughly for us.  Perchance we disagree and take a different standpoint. Then can one  almost see the spirit of the sage chuckling with delight at having found  someone with whom to cross swords. '_I have made him think, I have made  him think_,' he repeats gleefully; and, sure of his point, he delights in  having held our attention so intently as to cause us to debate the issue  with ourselves.    It were foolish, however, to suppose that _all_ the great books of the  world are at once suitable to every reader. Time, above all other  considerations, decides what we shall read; and the book which makes its  greatest impression upon one man at thirty will fail to appeal to his  neighbour till he be fifty or more. 'A man loves the meat in his youth  that he cannot endure in his age,' says Benedick, and the converse is  equally true. What a mistaken notion it is that puts into the hands of  boys such classics as 'The Pilgrim's Progress' and 'Don Quixote'; for  they are books which a knowledge of the world and of human nature alone  can enable us to appreciate to the full. Their very foundations are built  upon the rock of experience, every page exhibits the thoughts and deeds  of men. No wonder that nine boys out of ten grow up with a dislike of  Bunyan and all his works, and a contempt for the adventures of the  immortal Don. Generally, however, all recollection of Quixote, except  that he had a rotten old horse and charged some windmills, has  (mercifully) disappeared long before the reader has attained his  eighteenth year.    In later life, perhaps, we take up these books again, and are surprised  to find that they have completely changed. There is hardly an incident in  them that we remember, and we marvel how such and such a glorious passage  could possibly have escaped us before. Our book-hunter's experience must  have been that of many others. Long after his school-days were ended he  took up, for the first time, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.' How  wistfully he thought of the enjoyment that would have been his when at  school, had but some kind chance put into his hands this and similar  books in which boys, and real human boys, played the principal parts, not  strange outlandish men, the like of whom he had never met.    This unwise reading, this plunging, as it were, _in medias res_, is, I am  inclined to think, the reason why to so many men the library of great  authors is for ever locked. After a lengthy course of 'light' reading,  they take up, all at once, some such work as 'Bacon's Essays' or the  'Paradise Lost,' determined 'to give the classics a chance.' They wade  conscientiously through a good many pages, and then retire beaten, simply  because they have failed to recognise that in reading, as in every other  business, profession, craft, or pursuit, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. Who is  there, outside Olympus, that can master any of these at sight? It is only  by a continuous and continual course of reading that one comes at length  to appreciate these great masters. 'The proper appreciation of the great  books of the world is the reward of lifelong study. You must work up to  them, and unconsciously you will become trained to find great qualities  in what the world has decided is great.'[26]    'That's all very well,' says the newspaper-reader, taking the word  'study' in its first dictionary sense; 'but I, for one, haven't got  time--or inclination--for this lifelong application.' And yet, I reply,  you have both time and inclination to apply yourself assiduously to  newspapers, magazines, and suchlike reading. If you read at all, why not  read good healthy stuff, which will be of permanent use to you in your  journey through the world? Why devour garbage when rich meats are  constantly about you? 'To stuff our minds with what is simply trivial,  simply curious, or that which at best has but a low nutritive power, this  is to close our minds to what is solid and enlarging and spiritually  sustaining.'[27] Look at it which way you will, the man who purposely  neglects the great books deliberately closes the channels of knowledge  flowing to his brain, sentences himself to intellectual exile, bolts and  bars in his own face the only door which can lead him into the society of  the wisest and greatest men this world has known.    And what are the great books of the world? They are those which, from  their native excellences, have been approved by generations of wise men  as beneficial _for mankind_--not for their generation alone. Times change  and manners with them, but countless centuries are powerless to effect  the slightest change in man's essence. Do not the characters in the  oldest book in the world still live in our everyday life, and are not  they possessed of the very thoughts and reasonings that are our portion  to-day? Tastes may change vastly in even a short period, but it is only  fashion, the constant craving for something new:--        'Manners with fortunes, humours turn with climes,       Tenets with books, and principles with times.'    But the books which by common consent have been assigned places in the  library of the immortals can never be out of fashion: for they contain  the essences of human nature.    How then shall we start to make acquaintance with these classics? With  what books shall we begin, with what continue?

Would  it be thought strange if their thoughts wandered, or if the portraits of  the \"French Popes\" which hang about the Cathedral walls at Avignon,  show more worldly preoccupation than is becoming to the successors of  Saint Peter and Vicars of Christ?    Little indeed in the days of their residency did the Popes add to  Notre-Dame-des-Doms. A fragile, slender marvel of Gothic architecture,  the tomb of John XXII, was placed in the nave before the altar; and a  monument to Benedict XII was raised in the church. But their Holinesses  incited others in Avignon to good works so successfully that Rabelais  laughingly called it the \"Ringing city\" of churches, convents, and  monasteries. The bells of Saint-Pierre, Saint-Symphorien, Saint-Agricol,  Sainte-Claire, and Saint-Didier chimed with those of chapels and  religious foundations; the Grey Penitents, Black Penitents, and White  Penitents, priests, and nuns walked the streets, and Avignon grew truly  papal. Clement V and his successors proceeded to the safeguarding of  their temporal welfare in truly noble fashion; and scarcely fifty years  later they had become so well pleased with their new residence that the  magnificent Clement VI refused to leave in spite of the supplications of  Petrarch and Rienzi and a whole deputation of Romans.    During the reign of this Pontiff, the Papal Court became one of the  gayest in Christendom. Clement was frankly, joyously voluptuous; and his  life seems one moving pageant in which luxurious banquets, beautiful  women, and ecclesiastical pomps succeeded each other. The lovely  Countess of Turenne sold his preferments and benefices, the immense  treasure of John XXII was his, and he showered such benefits on a  grateful family that of the five Cardinals who accompanied his corpse  from Avignon, one was his brother, one his cousin, and three his  nephews; and that the Huguenots who violated his tomb at La-Chaise-Dieu,  should have used his skull as a wine-cup, seems an horrible, but not an  unfitting mockery. It was in vain that Petrarch hotly wrote, \"the Pope  keeps the Church of Jesus Christ in shameful exile.\" The desire for  return to Rome had passed.    Avignon was not an original nor a plenary possession of the Holy  Fathers, but \"the fairest inheritance of the Berengers,\" and it was from  that family that half of the city had to be wrested--or obtained. Now  the lords of Provence were Kings of Naples and Sicily, and therefore  vassals of the Holy See. For when the Normans took these Southern states  from the Greeks and thereby incurred the jealousy of all Italy, they had  warily placed themselves under the protection of the Pope and agreed to  hold their new possessions as a papal investiture. It happened at this  time that the vassal of the Pope in Naples and in Sicily was the  beauteous \"Reino Joanno,\" the heiress of Provence. What she was no  writer could describe in better words than these, \"with extreme beauty,  with youth that does not fade, red hair that holds the sunlight in its  tangles, a sweet voice, poetic gifts, regal peremptoriness, a Gallic  wit, genuine magnanimity, and rhapsodical piety, with strange indecorum  and bluntness of feeling under the extremes of splendour and misery,  just such a lovely, perverse, bewildering woman was she, great  granddaughter of Raymond-Berenger, fourth Count of Provence,--the pupil  of Boccaccio, the friend of Petrarch, the enemy of Saint Catherine of  Siena, the most dangerous and most dazzling woman of the XIV century. So  typically Provencal was this Queen's nature, that had she lived some  centuries later, she might have been Mirabeau's sister. The same  'terrible gift of familiarity,' the same talent of finding favour and  swaying popular assemblages, the same sensuousness, bold courage, and  great generosity were found in this early orphaned, thrice widowed  heiress of Provence. To this day, the memory of the Reino Joanno lives  in her native land, associated with numbers of towers and fortresses,  the style of whose architecture attests their origin under her reign. It  says much for her personal fascinations that far from being either  cursed or blamed she is still remembered and praised. The ruins of  Gremaud, Tour Drainmont, of Guillaumes, and a castle near Roccaspervera,  all bear her name: at Draguignan and Flagose, they tell you her canal  has supplied the town with water for generations: in the Esterels, the  peasants who got free grants of land, still invoke their benefactress.  At Saint-Vallier, she is blessed because she protected the hamlet near  the Siagne from the oppression of the Chapters of Grasse and Lerins. At  Aix and Avignon her fame is undying because she dispelled some  robber-bands; at Marseilles she is popular because she modified and  settled the jurisdiction of Viscounts and Bishops. Go up to Grasse and  in the big square where the trees throw a flickering shadow over the  street-traders, you will see built in a vaulted passage a flight of  stone steps, steps which every barefoot child will tell you belong to  the palace of 'La Reino Joanno.' Walls have been altered, gates have  disappeared, but down those time-worn steps once paced the liege lady of  Provence, the incomparable 'fair mischief' whose guilt ... must ever  remain one of the enigmas of history.\" This \"enigma\" has strange  analogies to one which has puzzled and impassioned the writers of many  generations, the mystery of that other \"fair mischief\" of a later  century, Mary Queen of Scots. Like Mary, Jeanne was accused of the  murder of her young husband, and being pressed by the vengeance of his  brother--no less a person than the King of Hungary,--she decided to  retreat to her native Provence and appeal to the Pope, her gallant and  not over-scrupulous suzerain. \"Jeanne landed at Ponchettes,\" continues  the writer who has so happily described her, \"and the consuls came to  assure her of their devotion. 'I come,' replied the heiress, whose wit  always suggested a happy phrase, 'to ask for your hearts and nothing but  your hearts.' As she did not allude to her debts, the populace threw up  their caps; the Prince de Monaco, just cured of his wound at Crecy,  placed his sword at her service; and the Baron de Benil, red-handed from  a cruel murder, besought her patronage which, perhaps from a  fellow-feeling, she promised with great alacrity. At Grasse she won all  hearts and made many more promises, and finally, arriving at Avignon,  she found Clement covetous of the city and well-disposed to her. Yet  morality obliged him to ask an explanation of her recent change of  husbands, and before three Cardinals, whom he appointed to be her  judges, the Queen pleaded her own cause. Not a blush tinged her cheek,  no tremor altered her melodious voice as she stood before the red-robed  Princes of the Church and narrated, in fluent Latin, the story of the  assassination of Andrew, the death of her child, and her marriage with  the murderer, Louis of Tarento, who stood by her side. The wily Pope  noted behind her the proud Provencal nobles, the Villeneuves and  d'Agoults, the de Baux and the Lescaris, who brought the fealty of the  hill-country, and who did not know that, having already sold her jewels  to the Jews, their fair Queen was covenanting with the Pope for Avignon.  The formal trial ended, the Pontiff solemnly declared the Queen to be  guiltless,--and she granted him the city for eighty thousand pieces of  gold.\"    [Illustration: \"THE GREAT PALACE.\"--AVIGNON.]    Clement enjoyed ownership in the same agreeable manner as his  predecessors, \"without the untying of purse-strings.\" Perhaps he used  the purse's contents for the more pressing claim of the great Palace of  which he built so large a part; perhaps he handed it, still filled, to  Innocent VI who built the famous fortifications of Avignon and protected  himself against the marauding \"White Companies,\" perhaps it was still  untouched when Bertrand du Guesclin and his Grand Company stood before  the gate and demanded \"benediction, absolution, and two hundred thousand  pounds.\" \"What!\" the Pope is said to have cried, \"must we give  absolution, which here in Avignon is paid for, and then give money  too--it is contrary to reason!\" Du Guesclin replied to the bearer of  these words, \"Here are many who care little for absolution, and much for  money,\"--and Urban yielded.    Gregory XI, the last of the \"French Popes,\" returned to Rome, and at his  death the \"Great Schism\" followed;--Clement VII, in Avignon, was  recognised by France, Spain, Scotland, Sicily, and Cyprus; Urban VI, in  Rome, by Italy, Austria, and England. The County Venaissin was ravaged  by wars and the pests that come in their train. At length the  Avignonnais, who had not enjoyed greater peace under their anointed  rulers than under worldling Counts, rose against Pierre de Luna, the  \"Anti-pope\" Benedict XIII, who fled. From that time no Pontiff entered  the gates, and the city was administered by papal legates. In later  days, in spite of the sacred character of its rulers and his own  undoubted orthodoxy, Louis XIV seized Avignon several times; and Louis  XV, in unfilial vengeance for the excommunication of the Duke of Parma,  took possession of the city. But it was not until after the beginning  of the French Revolution, in 1791, that the Avignonnais themselves  arose, chased the Vice-Legate of the Pope from the city, and appealed  for union with France; and it was at this period that the Chapel of  Sainte-Marthe, the Cloister, and the Chapter"]]]
