I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt's body may now be  removed. I suppose, doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which  wounded the lady?\"    \"A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done. But  there are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have been fired and  two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for.\"    \"So it would seem,\" said Holmes. \"Perhaps you can account also for the  bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?\"    He had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole  which had been drilled right through the lower window-sash about an inch  above the bottom.    \"By George!\" cried the inspector. \"How ever did you see that?\"    \"Because I looked for it.\"    \"Wonderful!\" said the country doctor. \"You are certainly right, sir.  Then a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have  been present. But who could that have been and how could he have got  away?\"    \"That is the problem which we are now about to solve,\" said Sherlock  Holmes. \"You remember, Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on  leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder I  remarked that the point was an extremely important one?\"    \"Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow you.\"    \"It suggested that at the time of the firing the window as well as the  door of the room had been open. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not  have been blown so rapidly through the house. A draught in the room was  necessary for that. Both door and window were only open for a very short  time, however.\"    \"How do you prove that?\"    \"Because the candle has not guttered.\"    \"Capital!\" cried the inspector. \"Capital!\"    \"Feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy  I conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who  stood outside this opening and fired through it. Any shot directed at  this person might hit the sash. I looked, and there, sure enough, was  the bullet mark!\"    \"But how came the window to be shut and fastened?\"    \"The woman's first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window. But,  halloa! what is this?\"    It was a lady's hand-bag which stood upon the study table--a trim little  hand-bag of crocodile-skin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned  the contents out. There were twenty fifty-pound notes of the Bank of  England, held together by an india-rubber band--nothing else.    \"This must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial,\" said Holmes,  as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector. \"It is now  necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet,  which has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from  inside the room. I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again. You  said, Mrs. King, that you were awakened by a LOUD explosion. When you  said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the  second one?\"    \"Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, and so it is hard to judge. But  it did seem very loud.\"    \"You don't think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the  same instant?\"    \"I am sure I couldn't say, sir.\"    \"I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather think, Inspector Martin,  that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will  kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden  has to offer.\"    A flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an  exclamation as we approached it. The flowers were trampled down, and the  soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. Large, masculine feet  they were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes. Holmes hunted about among  the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird. Then, with  a cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen  cylinder.    \"I thought so,\" said he; \"the revolver had an ejector, and here is the  third cartridge. I really think, Inspector Martin, that our case is  almost complete.\"    The country inspector's face had shown his intense amazement at the  rapid and masterful progress of Holmes's investigation. At first he  had shown some disposition to assert his own position; but now he was  overcome with admiration and ready to follow without question wherever  Holmes led.    \"Whom do you suspect?\" he asked.    \"I'll go into that later. There are several points in this problem which  I have not been able to explain to you yet. Now that I have got so far  I had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up  once and for all.\"    \"Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we get our man.\"    \"I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment  of action to enter into long and complex explanations. I have the  threads of this affair all in my hand. Even if this lady should never  recover consciousness we can still reconstruct the events of last night  and ensure that justice be done. First of all I wish to know whether  there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as 'Elrige's'?\"    The servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a  place. The stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that  a farmer of that name lived some miles off in the direction of East  Ruston.    \"Is it a lonely farm?\"    \"Very lonely, sir.\"    \"Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the  night?\"    \"Maybe not, sir.\"    Holmes thought for a little and then a curious smile played over his  face.    \"Saddle a horse, my lad,\" said he. \"I shall wish you to take a note to  Elrige's Farm.\"    He took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. With these  in front of him he worked for some time at the study-table. Finally he  handed a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands  of the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no  questions of any sort which might be put to him. I saw the outside of  the note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike  Holmes's usual precise hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney,  Elrige's Farm, East Ruston, Norfolk.    \"I think, inspector,\" Holmes remarked, \"that you would do well to  telegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you  may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county gaol.  The boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. If  there is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do well  to take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish,  and this investigation draws rapidly to a close.\"    When the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave  his instructions to the servants. If any visitor were to call asking for  Mrs. Hilton Cubitt no information should be given as to her condition,  but he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room. He impressed these  points upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way  into the drawing-room with the remark that the business was now out of  our hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until  we could see what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his  patients, and only the inspector and myself remained.    \"I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and  profitable manner,\" said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table  and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were  recorded the antics of the dancing men. \"As to you, friend Watson, I owe  you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain  so long unsatisfied. To you, inspector, the whole incident may appeal  as a remarkable professional study. I must tell you first of all the  interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations  which Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in Baker Street.\" He then  shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded. \"I  have here in front of me these singular productions, at which one  might smile had they not proved themselves to be the fore-runners of  so terrible a tragedy. I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret  writings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the  subject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers;  but I confess that this is entirely new to me. The object of those who  invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters  convey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random  sketches of children.    \"Having once recognised, however, that the symbols stood for letters,  and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret  writings, the solution was easy enough. The first message submitted to  me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say  with some confidence that the symbol XXX stood for E. As you are aware,  E is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it predominates  to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect  to find it most often. Out of fifteen symbols in the first message four  were the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as E. It is true  that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag and in some cases not,  but it was probable from the way in which the flags were distributed  that they were used to break the sentence up into words. I accepted this  as a hypothesis, and noted that E was represented by XXX.    \"But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of  the English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any  preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be  reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S,  H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#14)"],[1,"head till he saw the frog's back in the mud,  and then lunge at it like lightning. Generally he got his frog, and  through your glass you would see the unfortunate creature wriggling and  kicking his way into Quoskh's yellow beak. If the lunge missed, the  mother's keen eye followed the frog's frantic rush through the mud, with  a longer trail this time behind him, till he hid again; whereupon she  croaked the same youngster up for another try, and then the whole family  moved jerkily along, like a row of boys on stilts, to the next clump of  lily pads.    As the young grew older and stronger on their legs, I noticed the  rudiments, at least, of a curious habit of dancing, which seems to  belong to most of our long-legged wading birds. Sometimes, sitting  quietly in my canoe, I would see the young birds sail down in a long  slant to the shore. Immediately on alighting, before they gave any  thought to frogs or fish or carnal appetite, they would hop up and down,  balancing, swaying, spreading their wings, and hopping again round about  each other, as if bewitched. A few moments of this crazy performance,  and then they would stalk sedately along the shore, as if ashamed of  their ungainly levity; but at any moment the ecstasy might seize them  and they would hop again, as if they simply could not help it. This  occurred generally towards evening, when the birds had fed full and  were ready for play or for stretching their broad wings in preparation  for the long autumn flight.    Watching them, one evening, I remembered suddenly a curious scene that I  had stumbled upon when a boy. I had seen a great blue heron sail  croaking, croaking, into an arm of the big pond where I was catching  bullpouts, and crept down through dense woods to find out what he was  croaking about. Instead of one, I found eight or ten of the great birds  on an open shore, hopping ecstatically through some kind of a crazy  dance. A twig snapped as I crept nearer, and they scattered in instant  flight. It was September, and the instinct to flock and to migrate was  at work among them. When they came together for the first time some dim,  old remembrance of generations long gone by--the shreds of an ancient  instinct, whose meaning we can only guess at--had set them to dancing  wildly; though I doubted at the time whether they understood much what  they were doing.    [Illustration]    Perhaps I was wrong in this. Watching the young birds at their ungainly  hopping, the impulse to dance seemed uncontrollable; yet they were  immensely dignified about it at times; and again they appeared to get  some fun out of it--as much, perhaps, as we do out of some of our  peculiar dances, of which a visiting Chinaman once asked innocently:  \"Why don't you let your servants do it for you?\"    I have seen little green herons do the same thing in the woods at mating  time; and once, in the Zooelogical Gardens at Antwerp, I saw a  magnificent hopping performance by some giant cranes from Africa. Our  own sand-hill and whooping cranes are notorious dancers; and undoubtedly  it is more or less instinctive with all the tribes of the cranes and  herons, from the least to the greatest. But what the instinct  means--unless, like our own dancing, it is a pure bit of  pleasure-making, as crows play games and loons swim races--nobody can  tell.           *       *       *       *       *    Before the young were fully grown, and while yet they were following the  mother to learn the ways of frogging and fishing, a startling thing  occurred which made me ever afterwards look up to Quoskh with honest  admiration. I was still-fishing in the middle of the big lake, one late  afternoon, when Quoskh and her little ones sailed over the trees from  the beaver pond and lit on a grassy shore. A shallow little brook stole  into the lake there, and Mother Quoskh left her young to frog for  themselves, while she went fishing up the brook under the alders. I was  watching the young herons through my glass when I saw a sudden rush in  the tall grass near them. All three humped themselves, heron fashion, on  the instant. Two got away safely; the other had barely spread his wings  when a black animal leaped out of the grass for his neck and pulled him  down, flapping and croaking desperately.    I pulled up my killick on the instant and paddled over to see what was  going on, and what the creature was that had leaped out of the grass.  Before my paddle had swung a dozen strokes I saw the alders by the brook  open swiftly, and Mother Quoskh sailed out and drove like an arrow  straight at the struggling wing tips, which still flapped spasmodically  above the grass. Almost before her feet had dropped to a solid landing  she struck two fierce, blinding, downward blows of her great wings. Her  neck curved back and shot straight out, driving the keen six-inch bill  before it, quicker than ever a Roman arm drove its javelin. Above the  _lap-lap_ of my canoe I heard a savage cry of pain; the same black  animal leaped up out of the tangled grass, snapping for the neck; and a  desperate battle began, with short gasping croaks and snarls that made  caution unnecessary as I sped over to see who the robber was, and how  Quoskh was faring in the good fight.    The canoe shot up behind a point where, looking over the low bank, I had  the arena directly under my eye. The animal was a fisher--black-cat the  trappers call him--the most savage and powerful fighter of his size in  the whole world, I think. In the instant that I first saw him, quicker  than thought he had hurled himself twice at the towering bird's breast.  Each time he was met by a lightning blow in the face from Quoskh's  stiffened wing. His teeth ground the big quills to pulp; his claws tore  them into shreds; but he got no grip in the feathery mass, and he  slipped, clawing and snarling, into the grass, only to spring again like  a flash. Again the stiff wing blow; but this time his jump was higher;  one claw gripped the shoulder, tore its way through flying feathers to  the bone, while his weight dragged the big bird down. Then Quoskh  shortened her neck in a great curve. Like a snake it glided over the  edge of her own wing for two short, sharp down-thrusts of the deadly  javelin--so quick that my eye caught only the double yellow flash of it.  With a sharp screech the black-cat leaped away and whirled towards me  blindly. One eye was gone; an angry red welt showed just over the  other, telling how narrowly the second thrust had missed its mark.    A shiver ran over me as I remembered how nearly I had once come myself  to the black-cat's condition, and from the same keen weapon. I was a  small boy at the time, following a big, good-natured hunter that I met  in the woods, one day, from pure love of the wilds and for the glory of  carrying the game bag. He shot a great blue heron, which fell with a  broken wing into some soft mud and water grass. Carelessly he sent me to  fetch it, not caring to wet his own feet. As I ran up, the heron lay  resting quietly, his neck drawn back, his long keen bill pointing always  straight at my face. I had never seen so big a bird before, and bent  over him wondering at his long bill, admiring his intensely bright eye.    I did not know then--what I have since learned well--that you can always  tell when the rush or spring or blow of any beast or bird--or of any  man, for that matter--will surely come by watching the eye closely.  There is a fire that blazes in the eye before the blow comes, before  ever a muscle has stirred to do the brain's quick bidding. As I bent  over, fascinated by the keen, bright look of the wounded bird, and  reached down my hand to pick him up, there was a flash deep in the eye,  like the glint of sunshine from a mirror, and I dodged instinctively.  Well for me that I did so. Something shot by my face like lightning,  opening up a long red gash across my left temple from eye-brow to ear.  As I jumped I heard a careless laugh. \"Look out, Sonny, he may bite  you--Gosh! what a close call!\" And with a white, scared face, as he saw  the ugly wound that the heron's beak had opened, he dragged me away as  if there had been a bear in the water grass.    The black-cat had not yet received punishment enough. He is one of the  largest of the weasel family, and has a double measure of the weasel's  savageness and tenacity. He darted about the heron in a quick, nervous,  jumping circle, looking for an opening behind; while Quoskh lifted her  great torn wings as a shield and turned slowly on the defensive, so as  always to face the danger. A dozen times the fisher jumped, filling the  air with feathers; a dozen times the stiffened wings struck down to  intercept his spring, and every blow was followed by a swift javelin  thrust. Then, as the fisher crouched snarling in the grass, off his  guard for an instant, I saw Mother Quoskh take a sudden step forward,  her first offensive move--just as I had seen her twenty times at the  finish of a frog stalk--and her bill shot down with the whole power  of her long neck behind it. A harsh screech of pain followed the swift  blow; then the fisher wobbled away with blind, uncertain jumps towards  the shelter of the woods.    [Illustration: \"A DOZEN TIMES THE FISHER JUMPED, FILLING THE AIR WITH  FEATHERS\"]    And now, with her savage enemy in full flight, a fierce, hot anger  seemed to flare within the mother heron, burning out all the previous  cool, calculating defense. Her wings heaved aloft, as the soldiers of  old threw up their shields in the moment of victory; while her whole  frame seemed to swell with power, like a hero whose fight is won. She  darted after the fisher, first on the run, then with heavy wing beats,  till she headed him and with savage blows of pinion and beak drove him  back, seeing nothing, guided only by fear and instinct, towards the  water. For five minutes more she chevied him hither and yon through the"]]]
