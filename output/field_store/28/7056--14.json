For they  appeared to number seven or eight to every one of us, and moreover they  were all picked warriors in the very prime of life, brave, fierce,  determined fellows, every one of them, and well armed with spear,  shield, war-club, and, in some cases, a most formidable kind of battle-  axe.    \"Spread out right and left, and cut in wherever you can find room,\"  ordered the skipper as we plunged, stumbling and gasping, into the midst  of the fray.  And there was no difficulty in obeying this order; for,  narrow as the sand spit was, it was yet too wide for Mr Purchase and  the port watch to draw a close cordon across it; there were gaps of a  fathom or more in width between each of our men, and those gaps were  rapidly widening as some poor wretch went down, transfixed by a broad-  bladed spear, was clove to the shoulder by the terrific blow of an axe,  or had his brains dashed out by a war-club.  But as our contingent  arrived each man chose an enemy--there was no difficulty in doing that--  and pulled trigger upon him, generally bringing him down, for we were  too close to miss; after which it became literally a hand-to-hand fight,  some using their discharged muskets as clubs while others flung them  away and trusted to their cutlasses, and one or two at least--for I saw  them close alongside me--depended entirely upon the weapons with which  nature had provided them, first dealing an enemy a knock-out blow with  the clenched fist and then dispatching him with one of his own weapons.  As for me, I still had the brace of pistols and the cutlass with which I  had provided myself when setting-out upon our ill-starred boat  expedition up the river, and I made play as best I could with these,  bowling over a savage with each of my pistols and then whipping out my  cutlass.  For a time I did pretty well, I and those on either side of me  not only holding our ground but actually beginning to force the enemy  back; but at length a huge savage loomed up before me with his war-club  raised to strike.  My only chance seemed to be to get in a cut or a  thrust before the blow could fall, and I accordingly lunged out at his  great brawny chest.  But the fellow was keen-eyed and active as a cat;  he sprang to one side, avoiding my thrust, and at the same instant  brought down his club upon my blade with a force that shattered the  latter like glass and made my arm tingle to such an extent that for the  moment at least I was powerless in the right arm.  Then, quick as  thought, he swung up the huge club again, with the evident determination  to brain me.  Disarmed and defenceless, I did the on'y thing that was  possible, which was to spring at his great throat and grip it with my  left hand, pressing my thumb hard upon his wind-pipe.  But I was like a  child in his hands; he shook me off with scarcely an effort; and as I  went reeling backward I saw his club come sweeping down straight for the  top of my head.  At that precise instant something seemed to flash dully  before my eyes in a momentary gleam of starlight, a sharp _tchick_ came  to my ears, a few spots of what felt like hot rain spattered in my face,  and the great savage, his knees doubling beneath him, reeled backward  with a horrible groan and crashed to the sand, with Cupid's axe  quivering in his brain, while the club, flying from his relaxed grasp,  caught me on the left forearm, which I had instinctively flung up to  defend myself, snapping the bone like a carrot, and then whirling over  and catching me a blow upon the head that stretched me senseless.  But  before I fell I had become conscious that through the distracting noises  of the fight that raged around me I could hear the sound of renewed  firing spluttering out from the direction of the boats.    When my senses returned to me the day was apparently some three or four  hours old, for the shadows of certain objects upon which my eyes  happened to fall as I first opened them were, if anything, a trifle  shorter than the objects themselves, which was a sure indication that  the sun stood high in the heavens.  I was lying, with a number of other  people, in the large tent-like structure which the ward-room officers  had used on the preceding evening; and Hutchinson, the ship's surgeon,  was busily engaged in attending to the hurts of a seaman who lay not far  from me.    This was the first general impression that I gained of my surroundings  with the recovery of consciousness; the next was that my left arm, which  was throbbing and burning with a dull, aching pain from wrist to  shoulder, was firmly bound up and strapped tightly to my body, and that  my head, which also ached most abominably, was likewise swathed in  bandages.  I was parched with thirst, which was increased by the sound  of a man drinking eagerly at no great distance from me, and, turning my  head painfully in the direction of the sound, I saw Jack Keene, a  fellow-mid., administering drink out of a tin pannikin to a man whom I  presently recognised as Nugent, the master's mate, who, poor fellow,  seemed to be pretty near his last gasp.    \"Jack,\" I called feebly, \"you might bring me a drink presently, when you  have finished with Nugent, will you?  How are you feeling, Nugent?  Not  very badly hurt, I hope.\"    I saw Nugent's lips move, as though attempting to answer me, but no  sound came from them, while Keene, glancing towards me, shook his head  and laid his finger upon his lips as a sign, I took it, that I should  not attempt to engage the poor fellow in conversation.    \"All right, Fortescue,\" he said, in a low voice, \"I'll attend to you in  a brace of shakes.\"    He laid Nugent's head very gently back upon a jacket which had been  folded to serve as a pillow, and then, refilling the pannikin from a  bucket which stood close at hand, he came to me.    \"Feeling bad, old chap?\" he asked, as he raised my head and placed the  pannikin to my lips.  I emptied the pannikin before attempting to reply,  and then said--    \"Not so bad but that I might easily be a jolly sight worse.  Bring me  another drink, Jack, there's a good boy; that was like nectar.\"    \"Ah; glad you enjoyed it,\" was the reply.  \"But you'll have to wait a  spell for your next drink; Hutchinson's orders to me are that water is  to be administered to you fellows very sparingly, as it is drawn from  the river and is probably none too wholesome.  What are your hurts?\"    \"Broken arm and a cracked skull, so far as I know,\" I answered.  \"What's  the matter with poor Nugent?\"  I added, in a whisper.  \"He looks as  though he is about to slip his cable.\"    Jack nodded.  \"Yes, poor chap,\" he whispered.  \"No chance of his  weathering it.  Ripped open by one of those broad-bladed spears.  Can't  possibly recover.  Well, I must go and look after my other patients; I'm  acting surgeon's mate, you know.\"    \"Surgeon's mate!\"  I ejaculated.  \"Why, you surely don't mean to say  that Murdoch has been bowled over, too, do you?\"    \"No; not so bad as that,\" answered Jack.  \"He's away with the rest in  the boats.  The skipper's gone to pay a return visit to those fellows  who beat up our quarters last night.  And now I really must be off, you  know.  Go to sleep, if you can; it will do you all the good in the  world.\"    Go to sleep!  Yes, it was excellent advice, but I did not seem able to  follow it just then; the throbbing and aching of my arm and the racking  pain of my sore head were altogether against it, to say nothing of the  continuous groaning and moaning of the injured men round about me, and  the occasional sharp ejaculations of agony extorted from the unfortunate  individual who happened at the moment to be under the surgeon's hands.  So, instead, I looked about me and endeavoured to form some idea of the  extent of our casualties during the past night.  Judging from what I  saw, they must have been pretty heavy, for I counted twenty-three  wounded, including myself, and I realised that there might be others  elsewhere, for the tent in which we lay was full; there did not seem to  be room enough for another patient in it without undue crowding.  And  even supposing that we comprised the sum total of the wounded, there  must have been a large proportion of dead in so desperate an affair as  that of the past night.  I estimated that in so obstinately contested a  fight as that in which we had all sustained our injuries, and against  such tremendous odds as those which were opposed to us, there must have  been at least half as many dead as wounded, which would make our  casualties up to thirty-five; a very heavy percentage out of a crew  that, owing to various causes, was already, before this fresh  misfortune, growing short-handed.  When to these came to be added the  casualties sustained on the preceding day in the attack upon the  barracoon, it seemed to me that our new captain would have little more  than a mere handful of men available for service on this fresh  expedition upon which he had embarked--for I did not suppose that he had  gone off taking with him every sound man and leaving the camp and the  wounded entirely unprotected and exposed to a renewed attack by the  savages.    After about an hour's absence Jack came back to me again and gave me  another draught of water, which so greatly refreshed me that the  excitement and uneasiness under which I had been labouring since his  first visit gradually subsided, my aches and pains grew rather more  tolerable; my thoughts grew first more placid and then gradually more  disconnected, wandering away from the present into the past and to more  agreeable themes, my memory of past incidents became confused, and  finally I slept.    I must have slept some three or four hours; for when I awoke it was  undoubtedly afternoon; Hutchinson had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#14)"],[1,"groups--objects  of cognition, and acts of cognition. What is the subject of cognition?  Does it form a new group? By no means; it forms part of the first  group, of the object group; for it is something to be known.    Our second argument is one of fact. It consists in remembering that  which in practice we understand by the subject of cognition; or  rather, metaphorically we represent this subject to ourselves as an  organ--the eye that sees or the hand that touches--and we represent to  ourselves the relation subject-object in the shape of a material  relation between two distinct bodies which are separated by an  interval and between which some action is produced which unites them.  Or else, confusing the subject and the Ego, which are nevertheless two  different notions, we place the Ego in the consciousness of the  muscular effort struggling against something which resists. Or,  finally and still more frequently, we represent the subject to  ourselves by confusing it with our own personality; it is a part of  our biography, our name, our profession, our social status, our body,  our past life foreshortened, our character, or, in a word, our civil  personality, which becomes the subject of the relation subject-object.  We artificially endow this personality with the faculty of having  consciousness; and it results from this that the entity consciousness,  so difficult to define and to imagine, profits by all this factitious  addition and becomes a person, visible and even very large, in flesh  and bone, distinct from the object of cognition, and capable of living  a separate life.    It is not difficult to explain that all this clearness in the  representation of ideas is acquired by a falsification of the facts.  So sensorial a representation of consciousness is very unfaithful;  for our biography does not represent what we have called acts of  consciousness, but a large slice of our past experience--that is to  say, a synthesis of bygone sensations and images, a synthesis of  objects of consciousness; therefore a complete confusion between the  acts of consciousness and their objects. The formation of the  personality seems to me to have, above all, a legal and social  importance.[24] It is a peculiar grouping of states of consciousness  imposed by our relations with other individuals. But, metaphysically,  the subject thus understood is not distinguished from the object, and  there is nothing to add to our distinction between the object and the  act of consciousness.    Those who defend the existence of the subject point out that this  subject properly constitutes the Ego, and that the distinction of the  subject and the object corresponds to the distinction of the Ego and  non-Ego, and furnishes the separation between the physical and the  moral so long sought.    It is evidently very enticing to make of the Ego thus a primitive  notion of the consciousness; but this view of the Ego as opposed to  the non-Ego in no way corresponds to that of the mental and the  physical. The notion of the Ego is much larger, much more extensible,  than that of the mental; it is as encroaching as human pride, it  grasps in its conquering talons all that belongs to us; for we do not,  in life, make any great difference between what is _we_ and what is  _ours_--an insult to our dog, our dwelling, or our work wounds us as  much as an insult to ourselves. The possessive pronoun expresses both  possession and possessor. In fact, we consider our body as being  ourselves.    Here, then, are numbers of material things introducing themselves into  the category of mental things. If we wished to expel them and to  reduce the domain of the Ego to the domain of the mental, we could  only do so if we already possessed the criterion of what is  essentially mental. The notion of the Ego cannot therefore supply us  with this criterion.    Another opinion consists in making of the subject a spiritual  substance, of which the consciousness becomes a faculty. By substance  is understood an entity which possesses the two following principal  characteristics, unity and identity, this latter merging into unity,  for it is nothing else but the persistence of unity through the course  of time. Certain philosophers have asserted that through intuition we  can all establish that we are a spiritual substance. I am compelled to  reject this idea, because I think the expression _spiritual substance_  has no meaning; nothing but the sonorous value of six syllables. It  has also been supposed, that there exists a corporeal substance hidden  under the sensations, in which are implanted the qualities of bodies,  as the various organs of a flower are in its calyx. I will return  later to this conception of a material substance. That of a spiritual  substance cannot be defended, and the chief and fatal argument I urge  against it is, that we cannot represent it to our minds, we cannot  think it, and we cannot see in these words \"spiritual substance\" any  intelligible idea; for that which is mental is limited to \"that which  is of the consciousness.\" So soon as we endeavour to go beyond the  fact of having consciousness to imagine a particular state which must  be mental, one of two things happen; either we only grasp the void, or  else we construct a material and persistent object in which we  recognise psychical attributes. These are two conclusions which ought  to be rejected.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 23: This second method of expression, which I consider  inexact, is constantly found in DESCARTES. Different philosophers have  explicitly admitted that every act of cognition implies a relation  subject-object. This is one of the corner-stones of the neo-criticism  of RENOUVIER. He asserts that all representation is double-faced, and  that what is known to us presents itself in the character of both  representative and represented. He follows this up by describing  separately the phenomena and laws of the representative and of the  represented respectively.]    [Footnote 24: The preceding ten lines in the text I wrote after  reading a recent article of WILLIAM JAMES, who wishes to show that the  consciousness does not exist, but results simply from the relation or  the opposition raised between one part of our experience (the actual  experience, for instance, in the example of the perception of an  object) and another part, the remembrance of our person. But the  argument of JAMES goes too far; he is right in contesting the relation  subject-object, but not in contesting the existence of the  consciousness (W. JAMES: \"Does consciousness exist?\" in _J. of  Philosophy, &c._, Sept. 1904).]          CHAPTER VI    DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS--CATEGORIES OF THE UNDERSTANDING      It has often been said that the role of intelligence consists in  uniting or grasping the relations of things. An important question,  therefore, to put, is, if we know whereof these relations consist, and  what is the role of the mind in the establishment of a relation?    It now and then happens to us to perceive an isolated object, without  comparing it with any other, or endeavouring to find out whether it  differs from or resembles another, or presents with any other a  relation of cause to effect, or of sign to thing signified, or of  co-existence in time and space. Thus, I may see a red colour, and  occupy all the intellect at my disposal in the perception of this  colour, seeing nothing but it, and thinking of nothing but it.  Theoretically, this is not impossible to conceive, and, practically, I  ask myself if these isolated and solitary acts of consciousness do not  sometimes occur.    It certainly seems to me that I have noticed in myself moments of  intellectual tonelessness, when in the country, during the vacation,  I look at the ground, or the grass, without thinking of anything--or  at least, of anything but what I am looking at, and without comparing  my sensation with anything. I do not think we should admit in  principle, as do many philosophers, that \"we take no cognisance save  of relations.\" This is the _principle of relativity_, to which so much  attention has been given. Taken in this narrow sense, it seems to me  in no way imperative for our thoughts. We admit that it is very often  applied, but without feeling obliged to admit that it is of perpetual  and necessary application.    These reserves once made, it remains to remark, that the objects we  perceive very rarely present themselves in a state of perfect  isolation. On the contrary, they are brought near to other objects by  manifold relations of resemblance, of difference, or of connection in  time or space; and, further, they are compared with the ideas which  define them best. We do not have consciousness of an object, but of  the relations existing between several objects. Relation is the new  state produced by the fact that one perceives a plurality of objects,  and perceives them in a group.    Show me two colours in juxtaposition, and I do not see two colours  only, but, in addition, their resemblance in colour or value. Show me  two lines, and I do not see only their respective lengths but their  difference in length. Show me two points marked on a white sheet of  paper, and I do not see only the colour, form, and dimension of the  points, but their distance from each other. In our perceptions, as in  our conceptions, we have perpetually to do with the relations between  things. The more we reflect, the more we understand things, the more  clearly we see their relations; the multiplication of relations is the  measure of the depth of cognition.[25]    The nature of these relations is more difficult to ascertain than that  of objects. It seems to be more subtle. When two sounds make  themselves heard in succession, there is less difficulty in making the  nature of these two sounds understood than the nature of the fact that  one occurs before the other. It would appear that, in the"]]]
