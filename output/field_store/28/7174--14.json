Everything that Europe thinks, decides, and executes against  Islam spreads through those countries with the rapidity of lightning.  Caravans carry the news to the heart of China and to the equator, where  the tidings are commented upon in very singular fashion. Certain sparks  struck at our meetings and banquets kindle, little by little, menacing  flames. Hence, it would be an unpardonable legerity to close our eyes to  the dangers lurking beneath an apparent passivity. What the _Terdjuman_  of Crimea says between the lines is repeated by the Constantinople  _Ikdam_, and is commented on and exaggerated at Calcutta by _The Moslem  Chronicle_.    \"Of course, at present, the bond of Pan-Islamism is composed of tenuous  and dispersed strands. But Western aggression might easily unite those  strands into a solid whole, bringing about a general war\".[60]    In the decades which have elapsed since Vambery wrote those lines the  situation has become much more tense. Moslem resentment at European  dominance has increased, has been reinforced by nationalistic  aspirations almost unknown during the last century, and possesses  methods of highly efficient propaganda. For example, the Pan-Islamic  press, to which Vambery refers, has developed in truly extraordinary  fashion. In 1900 there were in the whole Islamic world not more than 200  propagandist journals. By 1906 there were 500, while in 1914 there were  well over 1000.[61] Moslems fully appreciate the post-office, the  railroad, and other modern methods of rapidly interchanging ideas.  \"Every Moslem country is in communication with every other Moslem  country: directly, by means of special emissaries, pilgrims, travellers,  traders, and postal exchanges; indirectly, by means of Mohammedan  newspapers, books, pamphlets, leaflets, and periodicals. I have met with  Cairo newspapers in Bagdad, Teheran, and Peshawar; Constantinople  newspapers in Basra and Bombay; Calcutta newspapers in Mohammerah,  Kerbela, and Port Said.\"[62] As for the professional Pan-Islamic  propagandists, more particularly those of the religious fraternities,  they swarm everywhere, rousing the fanaticism of the people: \"Travelling  under a thousand disguises--as merchants, preachers, students, doctors,  workmen, beggars, fakirs, mountebanks, pretended fools or rhapsodists,  these emissaries are everywhere well received by the Faithful and are  efficaciously protected against the suspicious investigations of the  European colonial authorities.\"[63]    Furthermore, there is to-day in the Moslem world a widespread  conviction, held by liberals and chauvinists alike (albeit for very  different reasons), that Islam is entering on a period of Renaissance  and renewed glory. Says Sir Theodore Morison: \"No Mohammedan believes  that Islamic civilization is dead or incapable of further development.  They recognize that it has fallen on evil days; that it has suffered  from an excessive veneration of the past, from prejudice and bigotry and  narrow scholasticism not unlike that which obscured European thought in  the Middle Ages; but they believe that Islam too is about to have its  Renaissance, that it is receiving from Western learning a stimulus which  will quicken it into fresh activity, and that the evidences of this new  life are everywhere manifest.\"[64]    Sir Theodore Morison describes the attitude of Moslem liberals. How  Pan-Islamists with anti-Western sentiments feel is well set forth by an  Egyptian, Yahya Siddyk, in his well-known book, _The Awakening of the  Islamic Peoples in the Fourteenth Century of the Hegira_.[65] The book  is doubly interesting because the author has a thorough Western  education, holding a law degree from the French university of Toulouse,  and is a judge on the Egyptian bench. Although, writing nearly a decade  before the cataclysm, Yahya Siddyk clearly foresaw the imminence of the  European War. \"Behold,\" he writes, \"these Great Powers ruining  themselves in terrifying armaments; measuring each other's strength with  defiant glances; menacing each other; contracting alliances which  continually break and which presage those terrible shocks which overturn  the world and cover it with ruins, fire, and blood! The future is God's,  and nothing is lasting save His Will.\"    Yahya Siddyk considers the Western world degenerate. \"Does this mean,\"  he asks, \"that Europe, our 'enlightened guide,' has already reached the  summit of its evolution? Has it already exhausted its vital force by two  or three centuries of hyperexertion? In other words: is it already  stricken with senility, and will it see itself soon obliged to yield its  civilizing role to other peoples less degenerate, less neurasthenic,  that is to say, younger, more robust, more healthy, than itself? In my  opinion, the present marks Europe's apogee, and its immoderate colonial  expansion means, not strength, but weakness. Despite the aureole of so  much grandeur, power, and glory, Europe is to-day more divided and more  fragile than ever, and ill conceals its malaise, its sufferings, and its  anguish. Its destiny is inexorably working out!...    \"The contact of Europe on the East has caused us both much good and much  evil: good, in the material and intellectual sense; evil, from the moral  and political point of view. Exhausted by long struggles, enervated by a  brilliant civilization, the Moslem peoples inevitably fell into a  malaise; but they are not stricken, they are not dead! These peoples,  conquered by the force of cannon, have not in the least lost their  unity, even under the oppressive regimes to which the Europeans have  long subjected them....    \"I have said that the European contact has been salutary to us from both  the material and intellectual point of view. What reforming Moslem  princes wished to impose by force on their Moslem subjects is to-day  realized a hundredfold. So great has been our progress in the last  twenty-five years in science, letters, and art that we may well hope to  be in all these things the equals of Europe in less than half a  century....    \"A new era opens for us with the fourteenth century of the Hegira, and  this happy century will mark our Renaissance and our great future! A new  breath animates the Mohammedan peoples of all races; all Moslems are  penetrated with the necessity of work and instruction! We all wish to  travel, do business, tempt fortune, brave dangers. There is in the East,  among the Mohammedans, a surprising activity, an animation, unknown  twenty-five years ago. There is to-day a real public opinion throughout  the East.\"    The author concludes: \"Let us hold firm, each for all, and let us hope,  hope, hope! We are fairly launched on the path of progress: let us  profit by it! It is Europe's very tyranny which has wrought our  transformation! It is our continued contact with Europe that favours our  evolution and inevitably hastens our revival! It is simply history  repeating itself; the Will of God fulfilling itself despite all  opposition and all resistance.... Europe's tutelage over Asiatics is  becoming more and more nominal--the gates of Asia are closing against  the European! Surely we glimpse before us a revolution without parallel  in the world's annals. A new age is at hand!\"    If this was the way Pan-Islamists were thinking in the opening years of  the century, it is clear that their views must have been confirmed and  intensified by the Great War.[66] The material power of the West was  thereby greatly reduced, while its prestige was equally sapped by the  character of the peace settlement and by the attendant disputes which  broke out among the victors. The mutual rivalries and jealousies of  England, France, Italy, and their satellites in the East have given  Moslems much food for hopeful thought, and have caused corresponding  disquietude in European minds. A French publicist recently admonished  his fellow Europeans that \"Islam does not recognize our colonial  frontiers,\" and added warningly, \"the great movement of Islamic union  inaugurated by Djemal-ed-Din el-Afghani is going on.\"[67]    The menacing temper of Islam is shown by the furious agitation which has  been going on for the last three years among India's 70,000,000 Moslems  against the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. This agitation is not  confined to India. It is general throughout Islam, and Sir Theodore  Morison does not overstate the case when he says: \"It is time the  British public realized the gravity of what is happening in the East.  The Mohammedan world is ablaze with anger from end to end at the  partition of Turkey. The outbreaks of violence in centres so far remote  as Kabul and Cairo are symptoms only of this widespread resentment. I  have been in close touch with Mohammedans of India for close upon thirty  years and I think it is my duty to warn the British public of the  passionate resentment which Moslems feel at the proposed dismemberment  of the Turkish Empire. The diplomats at Versailles apparently thought  that outside the Turkish homelands there is no sympathy for Turkey. This  is a disastrous blunder. You have but to meet the Mohammedan now in  London to realize the white heat to which their anger is rising. In  India itself the whole of the Mohammedan community from Peshawar to  Arcot is seething with passion upon this subject. Women inside the  Zenanas are weeping over it. Merchants who usually take no interest in  public affairs are leaving their shops and counting-houses to organize  remonstrances and petitions; even the mediaeval theologians of Deoband  and the Nadwatul-Ulama, whose detachment from the modern world is  proverbial, are coming from their cloisters to protest against the  destruction of Islam.\"[68]    Possibly the most serious aspect of the situation is that the Moslem  liberals are being driven into the camp of political Pan-Islamism.  Receptive though the liberals are to Western ideas, and averse "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#14)"],[1,"with White       Cotton Stockings & Leather heel'd Wooden Shoes.\"    Indian men often left their masters dishonestly dressed in their  masters' fine apparel, and even wearing beribboned flaxen wigs, which  must have been comic to a degree over their harsh, saturnine  countenances--\"as brown as any bun.\"    A limited substitute for Indian housemaids was found at an early day in  \"help,\" as it was called even then. Roger Williams, writing of his  daughter, said: \"She desires to spend some time in service & liked much  Mrs. Brenton who wanted.\" John Tinker, who himself was help, wrote thus  to John Winthrop; \"Help is scarce, hard to get, difficult to please,  uncertain, &c. Means runneth out and wages on & I cannot make choice of  my help.\" Children of well-to-do citizens thus worked in domestic  service. Members of the family of the rich Judge Sewall lived out as  help. The sons of Downing and of Hooke went with their kinsman, Governor  Winthrop, as servants. Sir Robert Crane also sent his cousin to the  governor as a farm-servant. In Andover an Abbott maiden lived as help  for years in the house of a Phillips. Children were bound out when but  eight years old. These neighborly forms of domestic assistance were  necessarily slow of growth and limited in extent, and negro slavery  appeared to the colonists a much more effectual and speedy way of  solving the difficulty; and the Indian war-prisoners, who proved such  poor and dangerous house-servants, seemed a convenient, cheap, and  God-sent means of exchange for \"Moores,\" as they were called, who were  far better servants. Emanuel Downing wrote in 1645 that he thought it  \"synne in us having power in our hand to suffer them (the Indians) to  mayntayne the worship of the devill,\" that they should be removed from  their pow-wows, and suggests the exchange for negroes, saying: \"I doe  not see how wee can thrive vntill wee into gett a stock of slaves  sufficient to doe all our business.\"    Downing had a personal interest in the gaining of Moors; for he had had  almost as much trouble in obtaining servants as he did in marrying off  his children. We find him and his wife writing to Winthrop for help,  buying Indians, sending home more than once to England for \"godlye  skylful paynstakeing girles,\" beseeching their neighbors to send them  servants \"of good caridg and godly conuersation;\" and at last buying  negroes, to try in every way to solve the vexed question.    Though the early planters came to New England to obtain and maintain  liberty, and \"bond slaverie, villinage,\" and other feudal servitudes  were prohibited under the ninety-first article of the Body of Liberties,  still they needed but this suggestion of Downing's to adopt quickly what  was then the universal and unquestioned practice of all Christian  nations--slavery. Josselyn found slaves on Noddle's Island in Boston  Harbor at his first visit, though they were not held in a Puritan  family. By 1687 a French refugee wrote home:         \"You may also here own Negroes and Negresses, there is not a house       in Boston however small may be its means, that has not one or       two.... Negroes cost from twenty to forty Pistoles.\"    In Connecticut the crime of man-stealing was made punishable by death;  and in 1646 the Massachusetts General Court awoke to the growing  condition of affairs and bore witness \"by the first Optunity, ag't the  hainous & crying sinn of man-stealing,\" and undertook to send back to  \"Gynny\" negroes who had been kidnapped by a slaver and brought to New  England, and to send a letter of explanation and apology with them.    Though in the beginning he refused to harbor or tolerate negro-stealers,  the Massachusetts Puritan of that day, enraged at the cruelty of the  savage red men, did not hesitate to sell Indian captives as slaves to  the West Indies. King Philip's wife and child were thus sold and there  died. Their story was told in scathing language by Edward Everett. In  1703 it was made legal to transport and sell in the Barbadoes all Indian  male captives under ten, and Indian women captives. Perhaps these  transactions quickly blunted whatever early feeling may have existed  against negro slavery, for soon the African slave-trade flourished in  New England as in Virginia, Newport being the New England centre of the  Guinea Trade. From 1707 to 1732 a tax of three guineas a head was  imposed in Rhode Island on each negro imported--on \"Guinea blackbirds.\"  It would be idle to dwell now on the cruelty of that horrid traffic, the  sufferings on board the slavers from lack of room, of food, of water,  of air. But three feet three, inches was allowed between decks for the  poor negro, who, accustomed to a free, out-of-door life, thus crouched  and sat through the passage. No wonder the loss of life was great. It  was chronicled in the newspapers and letters of the day in cold,  heartless language that plainly spoke the indifference of the public to  the trade and its awful consequences. I have never seen in any Southern  newspapers advertisements of negro sales that surpass in heartlessness  and viciousness the advertisements of our New England newspapers of the  eighteenth century. Negro children were advertised to be given away in  Boston, and were sold by the pound as was other merchandise. Samuel  Pewter advertised in the _Weekly Rehearsal_ in 1737 that he would sell  horses for ten shillings pay if the horse sale were accomplished, and  five shillings if he endeavored to sell and could not; and for negroes  \"_sixpence a pound_ on all he sells, and a reasonable price if he does  not sell.\"    Many letters still exist of advices from ship-owners to ship-captains,  advice as to the purchase, care, and choice of captives, \"to get one old  man for a Lingister; to worter ye Rum & sell by short mesuer &c. &c.\"  Negro-stealing by Americans continued till 1864, when a brig sailing  westward from Africa on that iniquitous errand, was lost at sea--a grim  ending to three centuries of incredible and unchristian cruelty.    The first anti-slavery tract published in America was written by Judge  Sewall in the year 1700--\"The Selling of Joseph.\" His timid protest but  little availed, though he persevered in his belief and his opposition to  the day of his death. Other colonists who were opposed to the traffic  were willing to buy slaves, that the poor heathen might be brought up in  a Christian land, be led away from their idols--Abraham and the  patriarchs were given as authorities in justification of thus doing. One  respectable Newport elder, who sent many a profitable venture to the  Gold Coast for \"black ivory,\" always gave pious thanks in meeting on the  Sunday after the safe arrival of a slaver, \"that a gracious overruling  Providence had been pleased to bring to this land of Freedom another  cargo of benighted heathen to enjoy the blessing of a Gospel  dispensation,\" and I suppose he fancied he had cheated his Maker, his  congregation, and himself into believing that there was some truth and  decency in the specious words that framed a lie in every clause. Many  ministers were slave owners; Daille--the French Huguenot, Dr. Hopkins,  Dr. Williams, Ezra Stiles, and Jonathan Edwards being noted examples.  The ministers from Eliot down were kind to the blacks, preaching special  sermons to them, and forming religious associations for them. A negro  school for reading, writing, and catechizing was established in Boston  in 1728.    Cotton Mather had a negro worth fifty pounds given him by his  congregation, and that \"most notorious benefactor,\" with his  never-ceasing \"essay to doe good,\" at once, in gratitude for the gift,  devoted the negro to God's service, and made many a noble resolve to  save, through God's grace, his bondsman's soul. It is painful to read at  a later date that he found his unregenerate slave \"horribly arrested by  spirits,\" by which he did not mean captured by the dreaded emissaries of  the devil who pervaded the air of Boston and Salem at that time, but  simply very drunk.    Slaves were more plentiful in Connecticut and Rhode Island than in  Massachusetts. Madam Knight gives a glimpse of Connecticut slave life in  1704, and of awkward table traits in both master and slave as well, when  she says that the negroes were too familiar, were permitted to sit at  the table with the master, and \"into the Dish goes the black Hoof as  freely as the white Hand.\" Hawthorne says of New England slaves:         \"They were not excluded from the domestic affections; in families       of middling rank, they had their places at the board; and when the       circle closed around the evening hearth its blaze glowed on their       dark shining faces, intermixed familiarly with their master's       children. It must have contributed to reconcile them to their lot,       that they saw white men and women imported from Europe as they had       been from Africa, and sold, though only for a term of years, yet as       actual slaves to the highest bidder.\"    In the main, New England slaves were not unhappy, for they were well  treated; and the race has the gift to be merry in the worst of  circumstances. Occasionally one would be brought to the northern land,  one of higher sensibilities, more sensitive affections, greater pride;  one who could not live a slave. Such a one was the haughty Congo Pomp,  who escaped to a swamp near Truro on Cape Cod--a swamp now called by his  name--and placing at the foot of a tree a jug of water and loaf of bread  to sustain him on his last long journey, hanged himself from the  low-hanging limbs, and thus obtained freedom. Such also was Parson  Williams's slave Cato in Longmeadow, Mass. He bore repeated whippings  for his high-spirited disobedience, \"for speaking out loud in meeting,  drinking too much cider, going on a rampage,\" and finally drowned  himself in a well.
