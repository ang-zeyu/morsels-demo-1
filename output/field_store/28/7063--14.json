The Great Calamity           MacFierce'un came to Whiskeyhurst      When summer days were hot,     And bided there wi' Jock McThirst,      A brawny brother Scot.     Gude Faith!  They made the whisky fly,      Like Highland chieftains true,     And when they'd drunk the beaker dry      They sang 'We are nae fou!'           'There is nae folk like oor ain folk,          Sae gallant and sae true.'         They sang the only Scottish joke          Which is, 'We are nae fou.'       Said bold McThirst, 'Let Saxons jaw      Aboot their great concerns,     But bonny Scotland beats them a',      The land o' cakes and Burns,     The land o' partridge, deer, and grouse,      Fill up your glass, I beg,     There's muckle whusky i' the house,      Forbye what's in the keg.'           And here a hearty laugh he laughed,          'Just come wi' me, I beg.'         MacFierce'un saw with pleasure daft          A fifty-gallon keg.       'Losh, man, that's grand,' MacFierce'un cried,      'Saw ever man the like,     Now, wi' the daylight, I maun ride      To meet a Southron tyke,     But I'll be back ere summer's gone,      So bide for me, I beg,     We'll make a grand assault upon      Yon deevil of a keg.'           .   .   .   .   .       MacFierce'un rode to Whiskeyhurst,      When summer days were gone,     And there he met with Jock McThirst      Was greetin' all alone.     'McThirst what gars ye look sae blank?      Have all yer wits gane daft?     Has that accursed Southron bank      Called up your overdraft?     Is all your grass burnt up wi' drouth?      Is wool and hides gone flat?'     McThirst replied, 'Gude friend, in truth,      'Tis muckle waur than that.'       'Has sair misfortune cursed your life      That you should weep sae free?     Is harm upon your bonny wife,      The children at your knee?     Is scaith upon your house and hame?'      McThirst upraised his head:     'My bairns hae done the deed of shame --      'Twere better they were dead.       'To think my bonny infant son      Should do the deed o' guilt --     _HE LET THE WHUSKEY SPIGOT RUN,      AND A' THE WHUSKEY'S SPILT!_'           .   .   .   .   .       Upon them both these words did bring      A solemn silence deep,     Gude faith, it is a fearsome thing      To see two strong men weep.          Come-by-Chance           As I pondered very weary o'er a volume long and dreary --     For the plot was void of interest -- 'twas the Postal Guide, in fact,     There I learnt the true location, distance, size, and population     Of each township, town, and village in the radius of the Act.       And I learnt that Puckawidgee stands beside the Murrumbidgee,     And that Booleroi and Bumble get their letters twice a year,     Also that the post inspector, when he visited Collector,     Closed the office up instanter, and re-opened Dungalear.       But my languid mood forsook me, when I found a name that took me,     Quite by chance I came across it -- 'Come-by-Chance' was what I read;     No location was assigned it, not a thing to help one find it,     Just an N which stood for northward, and the rest was all unsaid.       I shall leave my home, and forthward wander stoutly to the northward     Till I come by chance across it, and I'll straightway settle down,     For there can't be any hurry, nor the slightest cause for worry     Where the telegraph don't reach you nor the railways run to town.       And one's letters and exchanges come by chance across the ranges,     Where a wiry young Australian leads a pack-horse once a week,     And the good news grows by keeping, and you're spared the pain of weeping     Over bad news when the mailman drops the letters in the creek.       But I fear, and more's the pity, that there's really no such city,     For there's not a man can find it of the shrewdest folk I know,     'Come-by-chance', be sure it never means a land of fierce endeavour,     It is just the careless country where the dreamers only go.           .   .   .   .   .       Though we work and toil and hustle in our life of haste and bustle,     All that makes our life worth living comes unstriven for and free;     Man may weary and importune, but the fickle goddess Fortune     Deals him out his pain or pleasure, careless what his worth may be.       All the happy times entrancing, days of sport and nights of dancing,     Moonlit rides and stolen kisses, pouting lips and loving glance:     When you think of these be certain you have looked behind the curtain,     You have had the luck to linger just a while in 'Come-by-chance'.          Under the Shadow of Kiley's Hill           This is the place where they all were bred;      Some of the rafters are standing still;     Now they are scattered and lost and dead,     Every one from the old nest fled,      Out of the shadow of Kiley's Hill.       Better it is that they ne'er came back --      Changes and chances are quickly rung;     Now the old homestead is gone to rack,     Green is the grass on the well-worn track      Down by the gate where the roses clung.       Gone is the garden they kept with care;      Left to decay at its own sweet will,     Fruit trees and flower beds eaten bare,     Cattle and sheep where the roses were,      Under the shadow of Kiley's Hill.       Where are the children that throve and grew      In the old homestead in days gone by?     One is away on the far Barcoo     Watching his cattle the long year through,      Watching them starve in the droughts and die.       One in the town where all cares are rife,      Weary with troubles that cramp and kill,     Fain would be done with the restless strife,     Fain would go back to the old bush life,      Back to the shadow of Kiley's Hill.       One is away on the roving quest,      Seeking his share of the golden spoil,     Out in the wastes of the trackless west,     Wandering ever he gives the best      Of his years and strength to the hopeless toil.       What of the parents?  That unkept mound      Shows where they slumber united still;     Rough is their grave, but they sleep as sound     Out on the range as on holy ground,      Under the shadow of Kiley's Hill.          Jim Carew           Born of a thoroughbred English race,      Well proportioned and closely knit,     Neat of figure and handsome face,      Always ready and always fit,     Hard and wiry of limb and thew,     That was the ne'er-do-well Jim Carew.       One of the sons of the good old land --      Many a year since his like was known;     Never a game but he took command,      Never a sport but he held his own;     Gained at his college a triple blue --     Good as they make them was Jim Carew.       Came to grief -- was it card or horse?      Nobody asked and nobody cared;     Ship him away to the bush of course,      Ne'er-do-well fellows are easily spared;     Only of women a tolerable few     Sorrowed at parting with Jim Carew.       Gentleman Jim on the cattle camp,      Sitting his horse with an easy grace;     But the reckless living has left its stamp      In the deep drawn lines of that handsome face,     And a harder look in those eyes of blue:     Prompt at a quarrel is Jim Carew.       Billy the Lasher was out for gore --      Twelve-stone navvy with chest of hair,     When he opened out with a hungry roar      On a ten-stone man it was hardly fair;     But his wife was wise if his face she knew     By the time you were done with him, Jim Carew.       Gentleman Jim in the stockmen's hut      Works with them, toils with them, side by side;     As to his past -- well, his lips are shut.      'Gentleman once,' say his mates with pride;     And the wildest Cornstalk can ne'er outdo     In feats of recklessness, Jim Carew.       What should he live for?  A dull despair!      Drink is his master and drags him down,     Water of Lethe that drowns all care.      Gentleman Jim has a lot to drown,     And he reigns as king with a drunken crew,     Sinking to misery, Jim Carew.       Such is the end of the ne'er-do-well --      Jimmy the Boozer, all down at heel;     But he straightens up when he's asked to tell      His name and race, and a flash of steel     Still lightens up in those eyes of blue --     'I am, or -- no, I _WAS_ -- Jim Carew.'          The Swagman's Rest           We buried old Bob where the bloodwoods wave      At the foot of the Eaglehawk;     We fashioned a cross on the old man's grave,      For fear that his ghost might walk;     We carved his name on a bloodwood tree,      With the date of his sad decease,     And in place of 'Died from effects of spree',      We wrote 'May he rest in peace'.       For Bob was known on the Overland,      A regular old bush wag,     Tramping along in the dust and sand,      Humping his well-worn swag.     He would camp for days in the river-bed,      And loiter and 'fish for whales'.     'I'm into the swagman's yard,' he said,      'And I never shall find the rails.'       But he found the rails on that summer night      For a better place -- or worse,     As we watched by turns in the flickering light      With an old black gin for nurse.     The breeze came in with the scent of pine,      The river sounded clear,     When a change came on, and we saw the sign      That told us the end was near.       But he spoke in a cultured voice and low --      'I fancy they've \"sent the route\";     I once was an army man, you know,      Though now I'm a drunken brute;     But bury me out where the bloodwoods wave,      And if ever you're fairly stuck,     Just take and shovel me out of the grave      And, maybe, I'll bring you luck.       'For I've always heard --' here his voice fell weak,      His strength was well-nigh sped,     He gasped and struggled and tried to speak,      Then fell in a moment -- dead.

SAM BASS        Sam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home,    And at the age of seventeen young Sam began to roam.    Sam first came out to Texas a cowboy for to be,--    A kinder-hearted fellow you seldom ever see.      Sam used to deal in race stock, one called the Denton mare,    He matched her in scrub races, and took her to the Fair.    Sam used to coin the money and spent it just as free,    He always drank good whiskey wherever he might be.      Sam left the Collin's ranch in the merry month of May    With a herd of Texas cattle the Black Hills for to see,    Sold out in Custer City and then got on a spree,--    A harder set of cowboys you seldom ever see.      On their way back to Texas they robbed the U.P. train,    And then split up in couples and started out again.    Joe Collins and his partner were overtaken soon,    With all their hard-earned money they had to meet their doom.      Sam made it back to Texas all right side up with care;    Rode into the town of Denton with all his friends to share.    Sam's life was short in Texas; three robberies did he do,    He robbed all the passenger, mail, and express cars too.      Sam had four companions--four bold and daring lads--    They were Richardson, Jackson, Joe Collins, and Old Dad;    Four more bold and daring cowboys the rangers never knew,    They whipped the Texas rangers and ran the boys in blue.      Sam had another companion, called Arkansas for short,    Was shot by a Texas ranger by the name of Thomas Floyd;    Oh, Tom is a big six-footer and thinks he's mighty fly,    But I can tell you his racket,--he's a deadbeat on the sly.      Jim Murphy was arrested, and then released on bail;    He jumped his bond at Tyler and then took the train for       Terrell;    But Mayor Jones had posted Jim and that was all a stall,    'Twas only a plan to capture Sam before the coming fall.      Sam met his fate at Round Rock, July the twenty-first,    They pierced poor Sam with rifle balls and emptied out his purse.    Poor Sam he is a corpse and six foot under clay,    And Jackson's in the bushes trying to get away.      Jim had borrowed Sam's good gold and didn't want to pay,    The only shot he saw was to give poor Sam away.    He sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn,--    Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn.      And so he sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn,    Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn.    Perhaps he's got to heaven, there's none of us can say,    But if I'm right in my surmise he's gone the other way.        Sam Bass (Mus. Not.)        Sam Bass was born in In-di-an-a, It    was his na-tive home;   And at the age of    sev-en-teen, Young Sam be-gan to roam. Sam    first came out to Tex-as,   A cow-boy for to be; A    kind-er-heart-ed fel-low You sel-dom ev-er see.          THE ZEBRA DUN        We were camped on the plains at the head of the Cimarron    When along came a stranger and stopped to arger some.    He looked so very foolish that we began to look around,    We thought he was a greenhorn that had just 'scaped from town.      We asked if he had been to breakfast; he hadn't had a smear,    So we opened up the chuck-box and bade him have his share.    He took a cup of coffee and some biscuits and some beans,    And then began to talk and tell about foreign kings and queens,--      About the Spanish war and fighting on the seas    With guns as big as steers and ramrods big as trees,--    And about old Paul Jones, a mean, fighting son of a gun,    Who was the grittiest cuss that ever pulled a gun.      Such an educated feller his thoughts just came in herds,    He astonished all them cowboys with them jaw-breaking words.    He just kept on talking till he made the boys all sick,    And they began to look around just how to play a trick.      He said he had lost his job upon the Santa Fe    And was going across the plains to strike the 7-D.    He didn't say how come it, some trouble with the boss,    But said he'd like to borrow a nice fat saddle hoss.      This tickled all the boys to death, they laughed way down in their        sleeves,--    \"We will lend you a horse just as fresh and fat as you please.\"    Shorty grabbed a lariat and roped the Zebra Dun    And turned him over to the stranger and waited for the fun.      Old Dunny was a rocky outlaw that had grown so awful wild    That he could paw the white out of the moon every jump for a mile.    Old Dunny stood right still,--as if he didn't know,--    Until he was saddled and ready for to go.      When the stranger hit the saddle, old Dunny quit the earth    And traveled right straight up for all that he was worth.    A-pitching and a-squealing, a-having wall-eyed fits,    His hind feet perpendicular, his front ones in the bits.      We could see the tops of the mountains under Dunny every jump,    But the stranger he was growed there just like the camel's hump;    The stranger sat upon him and curled his black mustache    Just like a summer boarder waiting for his hash.      He thumped him in the shoulders and spurred him when he whirled,    To show them flunky punchers that he was the wolf of the world.    When the stranger had dismounted once more upon the ground,    We knew he was a thoroughbred and not a gent from town;      The boss who was standing round watching of the show,    Walked right up to the stranger and told him he needn't go,--    \"If you can use the lasso like you rode old Zebra Dun,    You are the man I've been looking for ever since the year one.\"      Oh, he could twirl the lariat and he didn't do it slow,    He could catch them fore feet nine out of ten for any kind of dough.    And when the herd stampeded he was always on the spot    And set them to nothing, like the boiling of a pot.      There's one thing and a shore thing I've learned since I've been born,    That every educated feller ain't a plumb greenhorn.          THE BUFFALO SKINNERS        Come all you jolly fellows and listen to my song,    There are not many verses, it will not detain you long;    It's concerning some young fellows who did agree to go    And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the buffalo.      It happened in Jacksboro in the spring of seventy-three,    A man by the name of Crego came stepping up to me,    Saying, \"How do you do, young fellow, and how would you like to go    And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the buffalo?\"      \"It's me being out of employment,\" this to Crego I did say,    \"This going out on the buffalo range depends upon the pay.    But if you will pay good wages and transportation too,    I think, sir, I will go with you to the range of the buffalo.\"      \"Yes, I will pay good wages, give transportation too,    Provided you will go with me and stay the summer through;    But if you should grow homesick, come back to Jacksboro,    I won't pay transportation from the range of the buffalo.\"      It's now our outfit was complete--seven able-bodied men,    With navy six and needle gun--our troubles did begin;    Our way it was a pleasant one, the route we had to go,    Until we crossed Pease River on the range of the buffalo.      It's now we've crossed Pease River, our troubles have begun.    The first damned tail I went to rip, Christ! how I cut my thumb!    While skinning the damned old stinkers our lives wasn't a show,    For the Indians watched to pick us off while skinning the buffalo.      He fed us on such sorry chuck I wished myself most dead,    It was old jerked beef, croton coffee, and sour bread.    Pease River's as salty as hell fire, the water I could        never go,--    O God! I wished I had never come to the range of the buffalo.      Our meat it was buffalo hump and iron wedge bread,    And all we had to sleep on was a buffalo robe for a bed;    The fleas and gray-backs worked on us, O boys, it was not slow,    I'll tell you there's no worse hell on earth than the range of the        buffalo.      Our hearts were cased with buffalo hocks, our souls were cased with        steel,    And the hardships of that summer would nearly make us reel.    While skinning the damned old stinkers our lives they had no show,    For the Indians waited to pick us off on the hills of Mexico.      The season being near over, old Crego he did say    The crowd had been extravagant, was in debt to him that day,--    We coaxed him and we begged him and still it was no go,--    We left old Crego's bones to bleach on the range of the buffalo.      Oh, it's now we've crossed Pease River and homeward we are        bound,    No more in that hell-fired country shall ever we be found.    Go home to our wives and sweethearts, tell others not to go,    For God's forsaken the buffalo range and the damned old buffalo.        Range of the Buffalo (Mus. Not.)        'Twas in the town of Jacksbo-ro, In eigh-teen eigh-ty-    three, When a man by the name of Cre-go... Came   "]]]
