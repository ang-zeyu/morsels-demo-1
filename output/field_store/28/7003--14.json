In sculptured           representations the scale device is dropped, and with it the           rigid regularity in the ordering of the pinions. Further, in           drawing the scales of the Triton, the artist has dropped usual           patterns and copied exactly a so-called bar-ornament which           decorates the cornice just over the pediment. Here again he           chooses one of the most common motives on vases. For the body           of the Echidna, on the other hand, it is the so-called           lattice-work pattern which represents the scale covering,--a           pattern employed in vases for the most varied purposes, and           found on the earliest Cypriote pottery. Even the roll of the           snake-bodies of Typhon seems to follow a conventional spiral           which we find on old Rhodian ware.             [Footnote 66: _Ibid._, No. 287.]    Page 41  The outlining and coloring of the figures is most interesting.           The poros stone of the reliefs is so soft that it could easily           be worked with a knife; so incised lines are constantly used,           and regular geometrical designs traced. Quite an assortment of           colors is employed: black, white, red, dark brown, apparent           green, and in the Typhon group, blue. It is very noticeable           that these reliefs, unlike the others which in general furnish           the closest analogies, the metopes of the temple at Selinous           and the pediment of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, have the           ground unpainted. This is distinctly after the manner of the           oldest Greek pottery and of archaic wall paintings. Herein they           resemble also another archaic pedimental relief, found near the           old temple of Dionysos at Athens, and representing just such a           procession of satyrs and mænads as appears so often on vases.             To give a local habitation to the class of pottery which most           nearly influenced the artist of these reliefs, is not easy.           Perhaps it is a reasonable conjecture to make it Kamiros of           Rhodes. Kamiros ware shows just such an admixture of oriental           and geometrical designs as characterizes our pediments. Strange           monsters of all kinds are represented there; while in the           reliefs before us a goodly number of such monsters are           translated to Greek soil.

THE FRIEZE OF THE CHORAGIC MONUMENT OF            LYSIKRATES AT ATHENS.[67]              [PLATE II-III.]               The small circular Corinthian edifice, called among the common           people the Lantern of Diogenes,[68] and erected, as we know           from the inscription[69] on the architrave, to commemorate a           choragic victory won by Lysikrates, son of Lysitheides, with a           boy-chorus of the tribe Akamantis, in the archonship of           Euainetos (B.C. 335/4), has long been one of the most familiar           of the lesser remains of ancient Athens. The monument was           originally crowned by the tripod which was the prize of the           successful chorus, and it doubtless was one of many buildings           of similar character along the famous \"Street of Tripods.\" [70]           It is the aim of this paper to show, that the earliest           publications of the sculptured reliefs on this monument have           given a faulty representation of them, owing to the           transposition of two sets of figures; that this mistake has           been repeated in most subsequent publications down to our day;           that inferences deduced therefrom have in so far been vitiated;           and that new instructive facts concerning Greek composition in           sculpture can be derived from a corrected rendering of the           original.             [Footnote 67: It is a pleasure to acknowledge my obligations to           the Director of the School, Dr. Waldstein, who has kindly           assisted me in the preparation of this paper by personal           suggestions.]             [Footnote 68: This does not exclude the tolerably well-attested           fact, that the name \"Lantern of Diogenes\" formerly belonged to           another similar building near by, which had disappeared by           1676.]             [Footnote 69: _C._ 1. _G._ 221.]             [Footnote 70: _Cf._ PAUS., I, 20, 1.]             Although we are not now concerned either with the subsequent           fortunes of the monument arid the story of its preservation, or  Page 43  with its architectural features and the various attempts which           have been made to restore the original design, it may be           convenient to recall briefly a few of the more important facts           pertaining to these questions. The Monument of Lysikrates first           became an object of antiquarian interest in 1669, when it was           purchased by the Capuchin monks, whose mission had succeeded           that of the Jesuits in 1658, and it was partially enclosed in           their _hospitium_.[71] The first attempt to explain its purpose           and meaning was made by a Prussian soldier, Johann Georg           Transfeldt, who, after escaping from slavery in the latter part           of 1674, fled to Athens, where he lived for more than a           year.[72] Transfeldt deciphered the inscription, but was unable           to decide whether the building was a \"_templum Demosthenis_\" or           a \"_Gymnasium a Lysicrate * * * exstructum propter juventutem           Atheniensem ex tribu Acamantia_.\" [73] Much more important for           the interpretation of the monument was the visit of Dr. Jacob           Spon of Lyons, who arrived at Athens early in the year 1676.           Spon also read the inscription,[74] and, from a comparison with           other similar inscriptions, determined the true purpose of           edifices of this class.[75] Finally the first volume of Stuart           and Revett's _Antiquities of Athens_, which appeared in 1762,           confirmed, corrected and extended Spon's results. Careful and           exhaustive drawings accompanied the description of the           monument.             In the latter part of the eighteenth and the early part of the           nineteenth century, Athens was visited by many strangers from           western Europe, and the hospitable convent of the Capuchins and           the enclosed \"Lantern,\" which at this time was used as a closet           for books, acquired some notoriety. Late in the year 1821,           however, during the occupation of Athens by the Turkish troops           under Omer Vrioni, the convent was accidentally burned, and its           most precious treasure was liberated, to be sure, but, as may           still be seen, sadly damaged by the fire, and what was still           more unfortunate, left unprotected and exposed to the           destructive mischief of Athenian street-arabs and their less           innocent elders.             [Footnote 71: SPON, _Voyage_, II, p. 244; LABORDE, _Athènes_,           I, p. 75 and note 2.]             [Footnote 72: MICHAELIS, _Mitth. Athen_., I, p. 103. ]             [Footnote 73: _Mitth. Athen._, I, p. 114.]             [Footnote 74: SPON, III, 2, p. 21 f. ]             [Footnote 75: SPON, II, p. 174.]             Aside from some slight repairs and the clearing away of           rubbish, the monument remained in this condition until 1867,  Page 44  when the French Minister at Athens, M. de Gobineau, acting on           behalf of his government, into whose possession the site of the           former monastery had fallen, employed the architect Boulanger           to make such restorations as were necessary to save the           monument from falling to pieces.[76] At the same time the last           remains of the old convent were removed, and some measures           taken to prevent further injury to the ruin. Repairs were again           being made under the direction of the French School at Athens,           when I left Greece, in April, 1892.             For the architectural study of the monument of Lysikrates           little has been done since Stuart's time. In the year 1845 and           in 1859, the architect Theoph. Hansen made a new series of           drawings from the monument, and upon them based a restoration           which differs somewhat from that of Stuart, especially in the           decoration of the roof. This work is discussed in the monograph           of Von Lützow.[77]             Confining our attention to the sculptures of the frieze, we           will examine certain inaccuracies of detail which have hitherto           prevailed in the treatment of this important landmark in the           history of decorative reliefs of the fourth century. The           frieze, carved in low relief upon a single block of marble,           runs continuously around the entire circumference of the           structure. Its height is only .012 m. (lower, rectangular           moulding) + .23 m. (between mouldings) + .015 m. (upper,           rounded moulding).[78] It is to be noticed that the figures           rest upon the lower moulding, while they are often (in fourteen           cases) carried to the top of the upper moulding.

Since the implosion of the USSR  in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away  from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet area. The  agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and  updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower  pace, but ahead of most of the rest of the CIS. Armenia is a food  importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The  ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated  region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the embargoes imposed by Azerbaijan and  Turkey contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By  1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious  IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth  rates in 1995-97. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to  privatize most small and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy  shortages Armenia suffered in recent years has been partially offset  by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor,  which in 1996 supplied about 40% of the country's energy needs,  according to the Armenian Government. Moreover, Armenia is expanding  its energy imports from Iran.    GDP: purchasing power parity-$9.5 billion (1997 est.)    GDP-real growth rate: 2.7% (1997 est.)
