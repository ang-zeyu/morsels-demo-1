[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#14)"],[1,"there, too, for all th'  Apaches out of Hades!\"    To the south another cloud of dust rapidly approached and the rider  scanned it closely, for it was directly in his path. As he watched it  he saw something wave and it was a sombrero! Shortly afterward a real  cowboy yell reached his ears. He grinned and slid another cartridge in  the greasy, smoking barrel of the Sharp's and fired again at the cloud  in his rear. Some few minutes later a whooping, bunched crowd of madly  riding cowboys thundered past him and he was recognized.    \"Hullo, Frenchy!\" yelled the nearest one. \"Comin' back?\"    \"Come on, McAllister!\" shouted another; \"we'll give 'em blazes!\" In  response the straining broncho suddenly stiffened, bunched and slid on  its haunches, wheeled and retraced its course. The rear cloud suddenly  scattered into many smaller ones and all swept off to the east. The  rescuing band overtook them and, several hours later, when seated around  a table in Tom Lee's saloon, Muddy Wells, a count was taken of them,  which was pleasing in its facts.    \"We was huntin' coyotes when we saw yu,\" said a smiling puncher who was  known as Salvation Carroll chiefly because he wasn't.    \"Yep! They've been stalkin' Tom's chickens,\" supplied Waffles, the  champion poker player of the outfit. Tom Lee's chickens could whip  anything of their kind for miles around and were reverenced accordingly.    \"Sho! Is that so?\" Asked Frenchy with mild incredulity, such a state of  affairs being deplorable.    \"She shore is!\" answered Tex Le Blanc, and then, as an afterthought, he  added, \"Where'd yu hit th' War-whoops?\"    \"'Bout four hours back. This here's th' second time I've headed for this  place--last time they chased me to Las Cruces.\"    \"That so?\" Asked Bigfoot Baker, a giant. \"Ain't they allus interferin',  now? Anyhow, they're better'n coyotes.\"    \"They was purty well heeled,\" suggested Tex, glancing at a bunch of  repeating Winchesters of late model which lay stacked in a corner.  \"Charley here said he thought they was from th' way yore cayuse looked,  didn't yu, Charley?\" Charley nodded and filled his pipe.    \"'Pears like a feller can't amble around much nowadays without havin' to  fight,\" grumbled Lefty Allen, who usually went out of his way hunting up  trouble.    \"We're goin' to th' Hills as soon as our cookie turns up,\" volunteered  Tenspot Davis, looking inquiringly at Frenchy. \"Heard any more news?\"    \"Nope. Same old story--lots of gold. Shucks, I've bit on so many of them  rumors that they don't feaze me no more. One man who don't know nothin'  about prospectin' goes an' stumbles over a fortune an' those who know it  from A to Izzard goes 'round pullin' in their belts.\"    \"We don't pull in no belts--we knows just where to look, don't we,  Tenspot?\" Remarked Tex, looking very wise.    \"Ya-as we do,\" answered Tenspot, \"if yu hasn't dreamed about it, we do.\"    \"Yu wait; I wasn't dreamin', none whatever,\" assured Tex.    \"I saw it!\"    \"Ya-as, I saw it too onct,\" replied Frenchy with sarcasm. \"Went and  lugged fifty pound of it all th' way to th' assay office--took me two  days! an' that there four-eyed cuss looks at it and snickers. Then  he takes me by di' arm an' leads me to th' window. 'See that pile, my  friend? That's all like yourn,' sez he. 'It's worth about one simoleon a  ton at th' coast. They use it for ballast.'\"    \"Aw! But this what I saw was gold!\" exploded Tex.    \"So was mine, for a while!\" laughed Frenchy, nodding to the bartender  for another round.    \"Well, we're tired of punchin' cows! Ride sixteen hours a day, year in  an' year out, an' what do we get? Fifty a month an' no chance to spend  it, an' grub that'd make a coyote sniffle! I'm for a vacation, an' if I  goes broke, why, I'll punch again!\" asserted Waffles, the foreman, thus  revealing the real purpose of the trip.    \"What'd yore boss say?\" Asked Frenchy.    \"Whoop! What didn't he say! Honest, I never thought he had it in him.  It was fine. He cussed an hour frontways an' then trailed back on a dead  gallop, with us a-laughin' fit to bust. Then he rustles for his gun an'  we rustles for town,\" answered Waffles, laughing at his remembrance of  it.    As Frenchy was about to reply his sombrero was snatched from his  head and disappeared. If he \"got mad\" he was to be regarded as not  sufficiently well acquainted for banter and he was at once in hot water;  if he took it good-naturedly he was one of the crowd in spirit; but in  either case he didn't get his hat without begging or fighting for  it. This was a recognized custom among the O-Bar-O outfit and was not  intended as an insult.    Frenchy grabbed at the empty air and arose. Punching Lefty playfully in  the ribs he passed his hands behind that person's back. Not finding the  lost head-gear he laughed and, tripping Lefty up, fell with him and,  reaching up on the table for his glass, poured the contents down Lefty's  back and arose.    \"Yu son-of-a-gun!\" indignantly wailed that unfortunate. \"Gee, it feels  funny,\" he added, grinning as he pulled the wet shirt away from his  spine.    \"Well, I've got to be amblin',\" said Frenchy, totally ignoring the  loss of his hat. \"Goin' down to Buckskin,\" he offered, and then asked,  \"When's yore cook comin'?\"    \"Day after to-morrow, if he don't get loaded,\" replied Tex.    \"Who is he?\"    \"A one-eyed Mexican--Quiensabe Antonio.\"    \"I used to know him. He's a heck of a cook. Dished up th' grub one  season when I was punchin' for th' Tin-Cup up in Montana,\" replied  Frenchy.    \"Oh, he kin cook now, all right.\" replied Waffles.    \"That's about all he can cook. Useter wash his knives in th' coffee pot  an' blow on di' tins. I chased him a mile one night for leavin' sand in  th' skillet. Yu can have him--I don't envy yu none whatever.    \"He don't sand no skillet when little Tenspot's around,\" assured that  person, slapping his holster. \"Does he, Lefty?\"    \"If he does, yu oughter be lynched,\" consoled Lefty.    \"Well, so long,\" remarked Frenchy, riding off to a small store, where he  bought a cheap sombrero.    Frenchy was a jack-of-all-trades, having been cow-puncher, prospector,  proprietor of a \"hotel\" in Albuquerque, foreman of a ranch, sheriff,  and at one time had played angel to a venturesome but poor show troupe.  Beside his versatility he was well known as the man who took the stage  through the Sioux country when no one else volunteered. He could shoot  with the best, but his one pride was the brand of poker he handed out.  Furthermore, he had never been known to take an unjust advantage over  any man and, on the contrary, had frequently voluntarily handicapped  himself to make the event more interesting. But he must not be classed  as being hampered with self-restraint.    His reasons for making this trip were two-fold: he wished to see Buck  Peters, the foreman of the Bar-20 outfit, as he and Buck had punched  cows together twenty years before and were firm friends; the other was  that he wished to get square with Hopalong Cassidy, who had decisively  cleaned him out the year before at poker. Hopalong played either  in great good luck or the contrary, while Frenchy played an even,  consistent game and usually left off richer than when he began, and this  decisive defeat bothered him more than he would admit, even to himself.    The round-up season was at hand and the Bar-20 was short of ropers, the  rumors of fresh gold discoveries in the Black Hills having drawn all the  more restless men north. The outfit also had a slight touch of the gold  fever, and only their peculiar loyalty to the ranch and the assurance  of the foreman that when the work was over he would accompany them, kept  them from joining the rush of those who desired sudden and much wealth  as the necessary preliminary of painting some cow town in all the \"bang  up\" style such an event would call for. Therefore they had been given  orders to secure the required assistance, and they intended to do so,  and were prepared to kidnap, if necessary, for the glamour of wealth and  the hilarity of the vacation made the hours falter in their speed.    As Frenchy leaned back in his chair in Cowan's saloon, Buckskin, early  the next morning, planning to get revenge on Hopalong and then to  recover his sombrero, he heard a medley of yells and whoops and soon the  door flew open before the strenuous and concentrated entry of a mass  of twisting and kicking arms and legs, which magically found their  respective owners and reverted to the established order of things.    When the alkali dust had thinned he saw seven cow-punchers sitting on  the prostrate form of another, who was earnestly engaged in trying to  push Johnny Nelson's head out in the street with one foot as he voiced  his lucid opinion of things in general and the seven in particular.  After Red Connors had been stabbed in the back several times by the  victim's energetic elbow he ran out of the room and presently returned  with a pleased expression and a sombrero full of water, his finger  plugging an old bullet hole in the crown.    \"Is he any better, Buck?\" Anxiously inquired the man with the reservoir.    \"About a dollar's worth,\" replied the foreman. \"Jest put a little right  here,\" he drawled as he pulled back the collar of the unfortunate's  shirt.    \"Ow! wow! WOW!\" wailed the recipient, heaving and straining. The  unengaged leg was suddenly wrested loose, and as it shot up and out  Billy Williams, with his pessimism aroused to a blue-ribbon pitch, sat  down forcibly in an adjacent part of the room, from where he lectured  between gasps on the follies of mankind and the attributes of army  mules.    Red tiptoed around the squirming bunch, looking for an opening, his  pleased expression now having added a grin.    \"Seems to be gittin' violent-like,\" he soliloquized, as he aimed a  stream at Hopalong's ear, which showed for a second as Pete Wilson  strove for a half-nelson, and he managed to include Johnny and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#14)"],[1," splendour;      Starry gems shone on it at the four corners,      Flashed from the shoulder-span five gleaming jewels.      Angels surrounded it, guarding it gladly.      Yet in its loveliness sad was that Cross to see,      For 'neath the gold and gems fast blood flowed from it,      Till it was all defiled with the dark drops.\"        _Dream of the Rood._    In this dream of Elene's the Cross spoke to her, and told her of the  sad fate which had made of that hapless tree the Cross on which the  Redeemer of mankind had released the souls of men from evil, on which  He had spread out His arms to embrace mankind, had bowed His head,  weary with the strife, and had given up His soul. All creation wept  that hour, for Christ was on the Cross.        \"Yet His friends came to him, left not His corpse alone,      Took down the Mighty King from His sharp sufferings--      Humbly I bowed myself down to the hands of men.      Sadly they laid Him down in His dark rock-hewn grave,      Sadly they sang for Him dirges for death-doomed ones,      Sadly they left Him there as His fair corpse grew cold.      We, the three Crosses, stood mournful in loneliness,      Till evil-thinking men felled us all three to ground,      Sank us deep into earth, sealed us from sight of man.\"        _Dream of the Rood._      She Undertakes the Quest    As Constantine had been guided by the heavenly vision of the True  Cross, so now Elene would journey to the land of the Jews and find the  reality of that Holy Cross. Her will and that of her son were one in  this matter, so that before long the whole city resounded with the  bustle and clamour of preparation, for Elene was to travel with the  pomp and retinue befitting the mother of the Emperor of Rome.        \"There by the Wendel Sea stood the wave-horses.      Proudly the plunging ships sought out the ocean path.      Line followed after line of the tall brine-ploughs.      Forth went the water-steeds o'er the sea-serpent's road      Bright shields on the bulwarks oft broke the foaming surge.      Ne'er saw I lady lead such a fair following!\"        _Elene._      She Comes to Judaea    Queen Elene had a prosperous voyage, and, after touching at the land  of the Greeks, reached in due time the country of Judaea, and so, with  good hope came to Jerusalem. There, in the emperor's name, she  summoned to an assembly all the oldest and wisest Jews, a congregation  of a thousand venerable rabbis, learned in all the books of the Law  and the Prophets and proud that they were the Chosen People in a world  of heathens, aliens from the True God. These she addressed at first  with a blending of flattery and reproach--flattery for the Chosen  People, reproach for their perversity of wickedness--and, finally,  peremptorily demanded an answer to any question she might ask of them.  The Jews withdrew and deliberated sadly whether they durst refuse the  request of so mighty a person as the emperor's mother, and, deciding  that they durst not, returned to the hall where Elene sat in splendour  on her throne and announced their readiness to reply to all her  questions. Elene, however, bade them first lessen their numbers. They  chose five hundred to reply for them, and on these she poured such  bitter reproaches that they at last exclaimed:        \"Lady, we learnt of yore laws of the Hebrew folk      Which all our fathers learnt from the true ark of God.      Lady, we know not now why thou thus blamest us;      How has the Jewish race done grievous wrong to thee?\"        _Elene._      She Cross-questions the Rabbis    Elene only replied: \"Go ye away, and choose out from among these five  hundred those whose wisdom is great enough to show them without delay  the answer to all things I require\"; and again they left her presence.  When they were alone, one of them, named Judas, said \"I know what  this queen requires: she will demand to know from us where the Cross  is concealed on which the Lord of the Christians was crucified; but if  we tell this secret I know well that the Jews will cease to bear rule  on the earth, and our holy scriptures will be forgotten. For my  grandfather Zacchaeus, as he lay dying, bade me confess the truth if  ever man should inquire concerning the Holy Tree; and when I asked how  our nation had failed to recognise the Holy and Just One, he told me  that he had always withdrawn himself from the evil deeds of his  generation, and their leaders had been blinded by their own  unrighteousness, and had slain the Lord of Glory. And he ended:        \"'Thus I and my father secretly held the Faith.      Now warn I thee, my son, speak not thou mockingly      Of the true Son of God reigning in glory:      For whom my Stephen died, and the Apostle Paul.'        _Elene._    \"Now,\" said Judas, \"since things are so, decide ye what we shall  reveal, or what conceal, if this queen asks us.\"      One Appointed to Answer her    The other elders replied: \"Do what seems to thee best, since thou  alone knowest this. Never have we heard of these strange secrets. Do  thou according to thy great wisdom.\"    While they still deliberated came the heralds with silver trumpets,  which they blew, proclaiming aloud:        \"The mighty Queen calls you, O men, to the Council,      That she may hear from you of your decision.      Great is the need ye have of all your wisdom.\"        _Elene._    Slowly and reluctantly the Jewish rabbis returned to the  council-chamber, and listened to Elene as she plied them with  questions about the ancient prophecies and the death of Christ; but to  all her inquiries they professed entire ignorance, until, in her  wrath, the queen threatened them with death by fire. Then they led  forward Judas, saying: \"He can reveal the mysteries of Fate, for he is  of noble race, the son of a prophet. He will tell thee truth, O Queen,  as thy soul loveth.\" Thus Elene let the other Jews go in peace, and  took Judas for a hostage.      She Threatens him    Now Elene greeted Judas and said:        \"Lo, thou perverse one, two things lie before thee,      Or death or life for thee: choose which thou wilt.\"        _Elene._    Judas replied to her, since he could not escape:        \"If the starved wanderer lost on the barren moors      Sees both a stone and bread, easily in his reach,      Which, O Queen, thinkest thou he will reject?\"        _Elene._    Thereupon Elene said: \"If thou wouldst dwell in heaven with the  angels, reveal to me where the True Cross lies hidden.\" Now Judas was  very sad, for his choice lay between death and the revealing of the  fateful secret, but he still tried to evade giving an answer,  protesting that too long a time had passed for the secret to be known.  Elene retorted that the Trojan War was a still more ancient story, and  yet was still well known; but Judas replied that men are bound to  remember the valiant deeds of nations; he himself had never even heard  the story of which she spoke. This obstinacy angered the queen  greatly, and she demanded to be taken at once to the hill of Calvary,  that she might purify it, for the sake of Him who died there; but  Judas only repeated:        \"I know not the place, nor aught of that field.\"        _Elene._    Queen Elene was yet more enraged by his stubborn denials, and  determined to obtain by force an answer to her questions. Calling her  servants, she bade them thrust Judas into a deep dry cistern, where he  lay, starving, bound hand and foot, for seven nights and days. On the  seventh day his stubborn spirit yielded, and Judas lifted up his voice  and called aloud, saying:        \"Now I beseech you all by the great God of heaven      That you will lift me up out of this misery.      I will tell all I know of that True Holy Cross,      Now I no longer can hide it for heavy pain.      Hunger has daunted me through all these dreary days.      Foolish was I of yore; late I confess it.\"        _Elene._      He Guides her to Calvary    The message was brought to Elene where she waited to hear tidings, and  she bade her servants lift the weakened Judas from the dark pit; then  they led him, half dead with hunger, out of the city to the hill of  Calvary. There Judas prayed to the God whom he now feared and  worshipped for a sign, some token to guide them in their search for  the Holy Cross. As he prayed a sweet-smelling vapour, curling upwards  like the incense-wreaths around the altar, rose to the skies from the  summit of the hill. The sign was manifest to all, and Judas gave  thanks to God for His great mercy; then, bidding the wondering  soldiers help him, he began to dig. By this time all men knew what  they sought, and each wished to uncover the holy relic, so that all  dug with great zeal, until, under twenty feet of earth, they  uncovered three crosses, so well preserved that they lay in the earth  just as the Jews had hidden them.      Three Crosses Found    Judas and all rejoiced greatly at this marvel, and, reverently raising  the three crosses, they bore them into the city, and laid them at the  feet of Queen Elene, whose first rapture of joy was speedily turned to  perplexity as she realised that she knew not which was that sacred  Cross on which the King of Angels had suffered. \"For,\" she said, \"two  thieves were crucified with him.\" But even Judas could not clear her  doubts.        \"Lo we have heard of this from all the holy books,      That there were with him two in His deep anguish.      They hung in death by Him; He was Himself the third.      Heaven was all darkened o'er at that dread moment.      Say, if thou rightly canst, which of these crosses      Is that blest Tree of Fate which bore the Heaven's King.\"        _Elene._    [Illustration: The Queen's dilemma]      A Miracle to Reveal our Saviour's Cross    Judas, however, suggested that the crosses should be carried to the  midst of the city, and that they should pray for another miracle to  reveal the truth.
