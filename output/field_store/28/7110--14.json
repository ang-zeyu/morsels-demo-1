In  both documents the property is described in the same words: \"All that  house, tenement or lodge commonly called the _Curtain_, and all that  parcel of ground and close, walled and enclosed with a brick wall on  the west and north parts, called also the _Curtain Close_.\" The lodge  here referred to, generally known as \"Curtain House,\" was on, or very  near, Holywell Lane;[123] the playhouse, as already stated, was  erected in the close near the Field.[124]    [Footnote 123: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 365.]    [Footnote 124: The Privy Council on March 10, 1601, refers to it as  \"The Curtaine in Moorefeildes\"; in ancient times, says Stow,  Moorefields extended to Holywell. See Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_,  I, 364.]    How long Sir William Allyn held the property, or why it reverted to  the Longe family, we do not know. But on March 18, 1582, we find  William Longe, the son of \"Maurice Longe, citizen and clothworker, of  London, deceased,\" selling the same property, described in the same  words, to one \"Thomas Harberte, citizen and girdler, of London.\" In  the meantime, of course, the playhouse had been erected, but no clear  or direct mention of the building is made in the deed of sale.  Possibly it was included in the conventionally worded phrase: \"and all  and singular other messuages, tenements, edifices, and buildings, with  all and singular their appurtenances, erected and builded upon the  said close called the Curtain.\"[125] Among the persons named as  holding tenures of the above-mentioned \"edifices and buildings\" in the  close was Henry Lanman. It seems not improbable, therefore, that the  Curtain, like the Theatre, was erected on leased ground.    [Footnote 125: Tomlins, _op. cit._, p. 31.]    It is impossible to give a connected history of the Curtain. Most of  the references to it that we now possess are invectives in early  puritanical writings, or bare mention, along with other playhouses, in  letters or ordinances of the Privy Council and the Lord Mayor. Such  references as these do not much help us in determining what companies  successively occupied the building, or what varying fortunes marked  its ownership and management. Yet a few scattered facts have sifted  down to us, and these I have arranged in chronological order.    On the afternoon of April 6, 1580, an earthquake, especially severe in  Holywell, shook the building during the performance of a play, and  greatly frightened the audience. Munday says merely: \"at the  playhouses the people came running forth, surprised with great  astonishment\";[126] but Stubbes, the Puritan, who saw in the event a  \"fearful judgment of God,\" writes with fervor: \"The like judgment  almost did the Lord show unto them a little before, being assembled at  their theatres to see their bawdy interludes and other trumperies  practised, for He caused the earth mightily to shake and quaver, as  though all would have fallen down; whereat the people, sore amazed,  some leapt down from the top of the turrets, pinnacles, and towers  where they stood, to the ground, whereof some had their legs broke,  some their arms, some their backs, some hurt one where, some another,  and many score crushed and bruised.\"[127]    [Footnote 126: _View of Sundry Examples_, 1580.]    [Footnote 127: _The Anatomy of Abuses_, ed. F.J. Furnivall, New  Shakspere Society, p. 180. For other descriptions of this earthquake  see Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 369.]    The disturbance at the Theatre and the Curtain in 1584, when one  Challes \"did turn upon the toe upon the belly of\" an apprentice  \"sleeping upon the grass\" in the Field near by, has been mentioned in  the preceding chapter. If the interpretation of the facts there given  is correct, Lord Arundel's Players were then occupying the Curtain.    In the winter of 1585 Lanman entered into his seven years' agreement  with Burbage and Brayne by which the Theatre and the Curtain were  placed under one management, and the profits shared \"in divident  between them.\" This agreement was faithfully kept by both parties, but  there is no evidence that after the expiration of the seven years, in  the winter of 1592, the affiliation was continued. What effect the  arrangement had upon the companies of players occupying the two  theatres we cannot now determine. To this period, however, I would  assign the appearance of the Queen's Men at the Curtain.[128]    [Footnote 128: _Tarlton's Jests_, ed. by J.O. Halliwell for the  Shakespeare Society (1844), p. 16. For a discussion see the preceding  chapter on the Theatre, p. 72.]    On July 28, 1597, as a result of the performance of Thomas Nashe's  _The Isle of Dogs_, by Pembroke's Men at the Swan,[129] the Privy  Council ordered the plucking down of \"the Curtain and the  Theatre.\"[130] The order, however, was not carried out, and in October  plays were allowed again as before.    [Footnote 129: For details see the chapter on the Swan.]    [Footnote 130: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVII, 313.]    At this time the Lord Chamberlain's men were at the Curtain, having  recently moved thither in consequence of the difficulties Cuthbert  Burbage was having with Gyles Alleyn over the Theatre property. During  the stay of the Chamberlain's Company, which numbered among its  members William Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, William Kempe (who had  succeeded Tarleton in popular favor as a clown), John Heminges, Thomas  Pope, and Augustine Phillips, the playhouse probably attained its  greatest distinction. Both Shakespeare and Jonson wrote plays for the  troupe; _Romeo and Juliet_, we are told, \"won Curtain plaudities,\" as  no doubt did many other of Shakespeare's early masterpieces; and  Jonson's _Every Man in His Humour_ created such enthusiasm here on its  first performance as to make its author famous.[131]    [Footnote 131: Marston, _The Scourge of Villainy_ (1598); Bullen, _The  Works of John Marston_, III, 372.]    In the summer of 1599 the Chamberlain's Men moved into their splendid  new home, the Globe, on the Bankside, and the Curtain thus abandoned  fell on hard times. Perhaps it was let occasionally to traveling  troupes; in Jeaffreson's _Middlesex County Records_, under the date of  March 11, 1600, is a notice of the arrest of one William Haukins  \"charged with a purse taken at a play at the Curtain.\" But shortly  after, in April, 1600, when Henslowe and Alleyn began to erect their  splendid new Fortune Playhouse, they were able to give the impression  to Tilney, the Master of the Revels, and to the Privy Council, that  the Curtain was to be torn down. Thus in the Council's warrant for the  building of the Fortune, dated April 8, 1600, we read that \"another  house is [to be] pulled down instead of it\";[132] and when the  Puritans later made vigorous protests against the erection of the  Fortune, the Council defended itself by stating that \"their Lordships  have been informed by Edmund Tilney, Esquire, Her Majesty's servant,  and Master of the Revels, that the house now in hand to be built by  the said Edward Alleyn is not intended to increase the number of the  playhouses, but to be instead of another, namely the Curtain, which is  either to be ruined and plucked down, or to be put to some other good  use.\"[133]    [Footnote 132: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 52.]    [Footnote 133: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 82.]    All this talk of the Curtain's being plucked down or devoted to other  uses suggests a contemplated change in the ownership or management of  the building. We do not know when Lanman died (in 1592 he described  himself as fifty-four years of age),[134] but we do know that at some  date prior to 1603 the Curtain had passed into the hands of a  syndicate. When this syndicate was organized, or who constituted its  members, we cannot say. Thomas Pope, in his will, dated July 22, 1603,  mentions his share \"of, in, and to all that playhouse, with the  appurtenances, called the Curtain\";[135] and John Underwood, in his  will, dated October 4, 1624, mentions his \"part or share ... in the  said playhouses called the Blackfriars, the Globe on the Bankside, and  the Curtain.\"[136] It may be significant that both Pope and Underwood  were sharers also in the Globe. Since, however, further information  is wanting, it is useless to speculate. We can only say that at some  time after the period of Lanman's sole proprietorship, the Curtain  passed into the hands of a group of sharers; and that after a  discussion in 1600 of demolishing the building or devoting it to other  uses, it entered upon a long and successful career.    [Footnote 134: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 148.]    [Footnote 135: J.P. Collier, _Lives of the Original Actors in  Shakespeare's Plays_, p. 127. In exactly the same words Pope disposed  of his share in the Globe.]    [Footnote 136: _Ibid._, p. 230.]    On May 10, 1601, \"the actors at the Curtain\"[137] gave serious offense  by representing on the stage persons \"of good desert and quality, that  are yet alive, under obscure manner, but yet in such sort as all the  hearers may take notice both of the matter and the persons that are  meant thereby.\" The Privy Council ordered the Justices of the Peace to  examine into the case and to punish the offenders.[138]    [Footnote 137: Possibly Derby's Men.]    [Footnote 138: See Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXXI, 346.]    Early in 1604 a draft of a royal patent for Queen Anne's Players--who  had hitherto been under the patronage of Worcester[139]--gives those  players permission to act \"within their now usual houses, called the  Curtain, and the Boar's Head.\"[140] On April 9, 1604, the Privy  Council authorized the three companies of players that had been taken  under royal patronage \"to exercise their plays in their several and  usual houses for that purpose, and no other, viz., the Globe,  scituate in Maiden Lane on the Bankside in the County of Surrey, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#14)"],[1," a bed. The others finally  faced the proposition and prepared, as best they could, their chosen  floor spaces for their beds.    All slept in their clothing, for we had no bedding and the night was  cold. The two men were banished to the outer air, where together they  smoked and talked of affairs of the day, while we women unbuttoned our  shoes, took out a few hairpins, cold-creamed our sunburned faces, and  then, between jokes, stories and giggling, we settled ourselves, with  much difficulty and hard snuggling, among our bags, raincoats, steamer  rugs and wraps on the rough board floor for the night.    Coming in later, the judge spread his borrowed fur robe upon the floor  beside his wife's cot, covered himself with one-half of the same,  chuckling as he did so.    \"I'm glad my bones are well cushioned with fat, and that I'm old and  tough and like this sort of thing. I say, wife, isn't it jolly?\" And the  portly and sunny old judge dropped off to sleep to keep me awake most of  the night by his snoring.    If I slept little that night I did not waste my time. My brain was busy  forming plans of action. It was not wise to have only one plan, for that  one might fail. Better to have several, and some one of these would  probably succeed. I felt a good deal of anxiety to know whether my  father or brother had or would come to Nome. If either or both of them  came I would have no further difficulty because I would work for and  with them, but if they did not come what was I to do?    I had little money. I would not go home. I would work. I was a good  cook, though I had never done such work except for our own home folks. I  knew that cooking was the kind of service most in demand in this country  from women, for my travels in Alaska the year before had taught me  that. I could teach music, and I could paint passably in water colors  and oils; in fact, I had been a teacher of all three, but in Alaska  these luxuries were not in demand. I could not expect to do anything in  these directions, for men and women had come to Nome for gold, expected  to get lots of it, and that quickly. They had no time for Beethoven's  sonatas or water color drawings.    It was now an urgent question of food, shelter and work with all, and  the man or woman who could the quickest devise ways and means, the one  who saw the needs of the time and place and was able to supply those  needs, was the one who could make the most money. Of course, being a  woman, I was unable to do beach mining as could a man, and as many men  expected to do. Those who brought large outfits and plenty of money with  them were immediately obliged to hire help, but it was generally a man's  help, like carpenter work, hauling and handling supplies or machinery,  making gold washers and sluice boxes, or digging out the gold in the  creeks. None of these could I do. On the steamer all these things had  been well talked over among ourselves, for others besides myself were  wondering which way they should turn when they found themselves in Nome.    As to there being any disgrace connected with work of any sort--it never  entered my head. From a child I had been taught that work was honorable,  and especially for a woman housework and cooking were respectable and  healthy service. So I had no pride whatever in the matter; it was only a  question of finding the work, and I did not doubt my ability to find it  somewhere.    On the voyage from San Francisco I had thought well of the three Swedish  women, and believed they would succeed in their proposed plan of  restaurant work. I said to myself that if I were obliged to seek work I  should like to be with them if possible; or, at least, with some of the  \"lucky Swedes,\" as the rich Anvil Creek mine owners were usually  designated. These miners all hired cooks for their camps, as they kept  large numbers of men at work day and night on the Anvil Creek claims,  the season being so short for placer mining in this country. Anvil Creek  was only four miles away and the \"Star Restaurant,\" as my friends had  already named their proposed eating-house, would be headquarters for all  the Scandinavians on Anvil and the entire district. For this reason, and  because the three had so many acquaintances who would bring them  patronage, and because their pleasant faces and agreeable manners always  made friends for them, I felt sure that they would be able to give me  work if they chose and I so desired. Then, too, there were the several  Dawson families of my acquaintance here, and I would find them; possibly  some of them might give me work if I asked them.    However, the first move to be made was to find our freight and baggage,  and a spot upon which to pitch our tents, and the sooner that was done  the better, as the test and cleanest camping places were fast being  appropriated by the newcomers hourly landing. It was not easy to find a  clean, dry spot for a tent, as I had found the day before that the  black, soggy soil was hardly free from frost a foot down, and this made  it everywhere marshy, as the water could not keep down nor run off where  it was level. Some one on the steamer who had been in Nome before had  advised us to pitch our tents on the \"Sandspit\" at the mouth of Snake  River, as that was the cleanest, driest and most healthful spot near  fresh water that we could find; and my mind was made up that it was to  the Sandspit I would go. Many had been the warnings from friends before  leaving home about drinking impure water, getting typhoid fever and  other deadly diseases, and without having any particular fear as to  these things I still earnestly desired a clean and healthful camping  place.    This, then, was the way I planned during most of the first night after  landing at Nome. If I slept it was towards morning, when I had become  accustomed to the regular and stentorian snores of the old judge; or  when, for a few moments, after turning in his sleep, his snorts and  wheezes had not yet reached their loudest pitch; and when my wishes had  shaped themselves so distinctly into plans for work that I felt relieved  and full of confidence, and so slept a little.    [Illustration: LIFE AT NOME.]    Next day I looked for my father. At the landing, on the streets, in the  stores, at all times I was on the lookout, though it was a difficult  matter to find any one in a crowd such as that in Nome. I saw several  acquaintances from Dawson the year before, and people from different  steamers that I knew, but not my father. At nine o'clock next morning  three of us started out to find the Sandspit, with, if possible, a good  camping spot to which we could take our freight as soon as it was  landed, and part of our number was detailed to stay at the landing while  we investigated. Down through the principal thoroughfare we pushed our  way, now on plank sidewalk, now in the middle of the street if the walks  were too crowded; but going to the west end of town till we came to  Snake River Bridge, where we crossed to the Sandspit. At the toll-gate  we easily passed, as all women were allowed to go over free, men only  being charged ten cents toll. Here we quickly found a clean, dry place  on the river bank a hundred feet below the bridge and two hundred feet  from the ocean, which we chose for our tents. Now arose the question,  would any one have any objection to our pitching our tents temporarily?  Seeing some men striking camp near by we asked them. They told us that  we could get permission, they thought, from an old captain near by on a  stranded boat, now being used as an eating-house, and to him we went. He  was not in.    Going back to the Sandspit, it was decided that I should remain upon  the spot, while my companions went back to the landing. I was to remain  there till some of them came back. This I did, sitting on a box in the  sunshine with my kodak, umbrella and lunch basket beside me for hours.  When madam returned, saying their search for their freight was still  unavailing, I left her in my place and again called upon the captain.    Calling the third time at his boat, I found him and secured his ready  permission to temporarily pitch our tents upon the sands, for he was an  Alderman with adjoining \"town lots,\" he told us.    By six o'clock that afternoon a part of madam's baggage and freight was  found, hauled by dog-team through town to the Sandspit and deposited  upon the ground. Then we bestirred ourselves to get a tent up in which  we could sleep, as I, for one, was determined not to be kept awake by  the judge's snores another night if I had to work till morning. The  others shared my feelings, and we worked like beavers till midnight. By  that time a small tent had been put up, boxes of bedding unpacked, as  well as cooking utensils, oil-stoves and foods, so that we could begin  cooking.    At the continuous daylight we were much pleased. Coming gradually into  it, as we had done on the steamer, we were prepared for it, but the  advantage of a continuous day to a busy, hustling camp like this one,  had not presented itself to us until we ourselves attempted to work half  the night; then we realized it fully. At nine in the evening a  beautiful twilight enveloped all, restful to nerves and eyes, but still  light enough to read by.    At ten o'clock it was lighter, and upon the placid waters of Snake  River, only fifteen feet away, lay quiet shadows cast from the opposite  side, clearly and beautifully reflected. A few small steamers lay  further down stream near the river's mouth, row boats were tied along  the edge of the water, and on the Sandspit below us was a camp of  Eskimos, their tiny canoes and larger skin boats being hauled upon shore  beside them for safety. At midnight the sun was almost shining, the air  was salt, fresh and clear, while the sky seemed to hang low and lovingly  above our heads.    After eating a midnight lunch of our own getting of bread and butter  with hot tea,"]]]
