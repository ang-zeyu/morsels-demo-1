The goddess smiled upon him with gentle  sympathy.    In the garden of her temple grew a tree with branches and twigs of  gold, and leaves as yellow as the little leaves of the silver birch  when the autumn sun kisses them as it sets. On this tree grew golden  apples, and Aphrodite plucked three of them and gave them to the youth  who had not feared to ask her to aid him to win the maid he loved.  How he was to use the apples she then told him, and, well content,  Milanion returned home.    Next day he spoke to Atalanta.    \"So far has victory been thine, Fairest on earth,\" he said, \"but so  far have thy little winged white feet had only the heavy-footed  laggards to outrun. Wilt have me run a race with thee? for assuredly I  shall win thee for my own.\"    And Milanion looked into the eyes of Atalanta with a smile as gay and  fearless as that with which a hero is wont to look in the eyes of his  fellow.    Look for look did the virgin huntress give him.    Then her cheeks grew red, as though the rosy-fingered dawn had touched  them, and the dawning of love came into her heart.    Even Meleager was not quite so goodly a youth as this. Not even  Meleager had been so wholly fearless.    \"Thou art tempted by the deathless gods,\" she said, but her long  lashes drooped on her cheek as she spoke. \"I pity you, Milanion, for  when thou dost race with me, the goal is assuredly the meadows of  asphodel near where sit Pluto and Persephone on their gloomy thrones.\"    But Milanion said, \"I am ready, Atalanta. Wilt race with me now?\" And  steadily he looked in her eyes until again they fell as though at last  they had found a conqueror.    Like two swallows that skim across a sunny sea, filled with the  joyousness of the coming of spring, Atalanta and Milanion started.  Scarcely did their feet seem to touch the solid earth, and all  those who stood by vowed that now, at length, was a race indeed, a  race worthy for the gods to behold.    [Illustration: SHE STOPPED, AND PICKED UP THE TREASURE]    But as they ran, almost abreast, so that none could tell which was the  gainer, Milanion obeyed the bidding of Aphrodite and let fall one of  the golden apples. Never before had Atalanta dreamed of such a  thing--an apple of glistening gold! She stopped, poised on one foot as  a flying bird poises for a moment on the wing, and picked up the  treasure. But Milanion had sped several paces ahead ere she was again  abreast of him, and even as she gained on him, he dropped the second  apple. Again Atalanta was tempted. Again she stopped, and again  Milanion shot ahead of her. Her breath came short and fast, as once  more she gained the ground that she had lost. But, yet a third time,  Milanion threw in her way one of the golden illusions of the gods.  And, yet again, Atalanta stooped to pick up the apple of gold.    Then a mighty shout from those who watched rent the air, and Atalanta,  half fearful, half ashamed, yet wholly happy, found herself running,  vanquished, into the arms of him who was indeed her conqueror. For not  only had Milanion won the race, but he had won the heart of the virgin  huntress, a heart once as cold and remote as the winter snow on the  peak of Mount Olympus.          ARACHNE      The hay that so short a time ago was long, lush grass, with fragrant  meadow-sweet and gold-eyed marguerites growing amongst it in the green  meadow-land by the river, is now dry hay--fragrant still, though dead,  and hidden from the sun's warm rays underneath the dark wooden rafters  of the barn. Occasionally a cat on a hunting foray comes into the barn  to look for mice, or to nestle cosily down into purring slumber. Now  and then a hen comes furtively tip-toeing through the open door and  makes for itself a secret nest in which to lay the eggs which it  subsequently heralds with such loud clucks of proud rejoicing as to  completely undo all its previous precautions. Sometimes children come  in, pursuing cat or hen, or merely to tumble each other over amongst  the soft hay which they leave in chaotic confusion, and when they have  gone away, a little more of the sky can be seen through the little  window in the roof, and through the wooden bars of the window lower  down. Yet, whatever other living creatures may come or go, by those  windows of the barn, and high up on its dark rafters, there is always  a living creature working, ceaselessly working. When, through the  skylight, the sun-god drives a golden sunbeam, and a long shaft of  dancing dust-atoms passes from the window to what was once a part of  the early summer's glory, the work of the unresting toiler is also to  be seen, for the window is hung with shimmering grey tapestries made  by Arachne, the spider, and from rafter to rafter her threads are  suspended with inimitable skill.    She was a nymph once, they say--the daughter of Idmon the dyer, of  Colophon, a city of Lydia. In all Lydia there was none who could weave  as wove the beautiful Arachne. To watch her card the wool of the  white-fleeced sheep until in her fingers it grew like the soft clouds  that hang round the hill tops, was pleasure enough to draw nymphs from  the golden river Pactolus and from the vineyards of Tymolus. And when  she drove her swift shuttle hither and thither, still it was joy to  watch her wondrous skill. Magical was the growth of the web, fine of  woof, that her darting fingers span, and yet more magical the  exquisite devices that she then wrought upon it. For birds and flowers  and butterflies and pictures of all the beautiful things on earth were  limned by Arachne, and old tales grew alive again under her creative  needle.    To Pallas Athene, goddess of craftsmen, came tidings that at Colophon  in Lydia lived a nymph whose skill rivalled that of the goddess  herself, and she, ever jealous for her own honour, took on herself the  form of a woman bent with age, and, leaning on her staff, joined the  little crowd that hung round Arachne as she plied her busy needle.  With white arms twined round each other the eager nymphs watched the  flowers spring up under her fingers, even as flowers spring from the  ground on the coming of Demeter, and Athene was fain to admire, while  she marvelled at the magic skill of the fair Arachne.    Gently she spoke to Arachne, and, with the persuasive words of a wise  old woman, warned her that she must not let her ambition soar too  high. Greater than all skilled craftswomen was the great goddess  Athene, and were Arachne, in impious vanity, to dream that one day she  might equal her, that were indeed a crime for any god to punish.    Glancing up for a moment from the picture whose perfect colours grew  fast under her slim fingers, Arachne fixed scornful eyes on the old  woman and gave a merry laugh.    \"Didst say _equal_ Athene? old mother,\" she said. \"In good sooth thy  dwelling must be with the goat-herds in the far-off hills and thou art  not a dweller in our city. Else hadst thou not spoken to Arachne of  _equalling_ the work of Athene; _excelling_ were the better word.\"    In anger Pallas Athene made answer.    \"Impious one!\" she said, \"to those who would make themselves higher  than the gods must ever come woe unutterable. Take heed what thou  sayest, for punishment will assuredly be thine.\"    Laughing still, Arachne made reply:    \"I fear not, Athene, nor does my heart shake at the gloomy warning of  a foolish old crone.\" And turning to the nymphs who, half afraid,  listened to her daring words, she said: \"Fair nymphs who watch me day  by day, well do ye know that I make no idle boast. My skill is as  great as that of Athene, and greater still it shall be. Let Athene try  a contest with me if she dare! Well do I know who will be the victor.\"    Then Athene cast off her disguise, and before the frightened nymphs  and the bold Arachne stood the radiant goddess with eyes that blazed  with anger and insulted pride.    \"Lo, Athene is come!\" she said, and nymphs and women fell on their  knees before her, humbly adoring. Arachne alone was unabashed. Her  cheeks showed how fast her heart was beating. From rosy red to white  went the colour in them, yet, in firm, low voice she spoke.    \"I have spoken truth,\" she said. \"Not woman, nor goddess, can do work  such as mine. Ready am I to abide by what I have said, and if I did  boast, by my boast I stand. If thou wilt deign, great goddess, to try  thy skill against the skill of the dyer's daughter and dost prove the  victor, behold me gladly willing to pay the penalty.\"    The eyes of Athene, the grey-eyed goddess, grew dark as the sea when a  thunder-cloud hangs over it and a mighty storm is coming. Not for one  moment did she delay, but took her place by the side of Arachne. On  the loom they stretched out two webs with a fine warp, and made them  fast on the beam.        \"The sley separates the warp, the woof is inserted in      the middle with sharp shuttles, which the fingers hurry      along, and, being drawn within the warp, the teeth      notched in the moving sley strike it. Both hasten on,      and girding up their garments to their breasts, they      move their skilful arms, their eagerness beguiling their      fatigue. There both the purple is being woven, which is      subjected to the Tyrian brazen vessel, and fine shades      of minute difference; just as the rainbow, with its      mighty arch, is wont to tint a long tract of sky by      means of the rays reflected by the shower; in which,      though a thousand different colours are shining, yet the      very transition eludes the eyes that look upon it....      There, too, the pliant gold is mixed with the threads.\"            Ovid.    Their canvases wrought, then did Athene and Arachne hasten to cover  them with pictures such as no skilled worker of tapestry has "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#14)"],[1,"was held in the  Theatre-Royal, then, as now, the only building in Dublin capable of  accommodating the vast number which alone could render such a  speculation remunerative. The theatre can hold two thousand six hundred  persons, all of whom may see and hear, whether in the boxes, pit, or  galleries. The arrangement was, to have oratorios kept distinct on  certain mornings, and miscellaneous concerts on the evenings of other  days. The concerts were crushers, but the first oratorio was decidedly a  break down. The committee became alarmed; the expenses were enormous,  and heavy liabilities stared them in the face. There was no time to be  lost, and at the second oratorio, duly announced, there stood Paganini,  in front of the orchestra, violin in hand, on an advanced platform,  overhanging the pit, not unlike orator Henley's tub, as immortalized by  the poet. Between the acts of the Messiah and the Creation, he fiddled  'the Witches at the Great Walnut Tree of Benevento,' with other equally  appropriate interpolations, to the ecstatic delight of applauding  thousands, who cared not a pin for Hadyn or Handel, but came to hear  Paganini alone; and to the no small scandal of the select few, who  thought the episode a little on the north side of consistency. But the  money was thereby forthcoming, every body was paid, the committee  escaped without damage, and a hazardous speculation, undertaken by a few  spirited individuals, was wound up with deserved success.    \"When the festival was over, the town empty, and a cannon-ball might  have fired down Sackville-street, without doing much injury, Paganini  was engaged by himself for a series of five performances in the theatre.  For this he received L1,143. His dividend on the first night's receipts  amounted to L330 (_horresco referens_)! without a shilling of outlay  incurred on his part. He had the lion's share with a vengeance, as the  manager cleared with difficulty L200. The terms he demanded and obtained  were a clear two-thirds of each night's receipts, twenty-five guineas  per night for the services of two auxiliaries, worth about as many  shillings, the full value allowed for every free ticket, and an express  stipulation that if he required a rehearsal on a dark morning, when  extra light might be indispensable, the expense of candles should not  fall on him--a contingency which by no possible contrivance could  involve a responsibility exceeding five or six shillings.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [23] A current is supposed to flow constantly from the Pacific through  the North-West Passage into the Atlantic.          A PEASANT DUCHESS.      The _Stamford Mercury_ gives an interesting account of the life and  fortunes of a young woman of that neighborhood who rose to a high  station by means of her personal attractions, and, after a checkered  life, died in Italy a few weeks ago. She was the daughter of John Peele,  a small farmer at Corringham, near Gainsborough, who eked out a somewhat  declining livelihood by dealing in horses, &c., having previously been  in better circumstances. Being an only daughter, and aware that she  possessed no small share of rustic charms, she resolved to try her  fortune in a higher sphere. She became a dressmaker in Gainsborough, and  resided subsequently in Hull, and it is said as housemaid in a good  family in London, where her attractions obtained for her the attentions  of a person of rank, to whom she afterwards averred she was married; and  she from that time occupied a position where her fortunes led her into  contact with some of the highest classes. A few years afterwards she  astonished her former companions by appearing with her carriage and  livery servants in the character of _chere amie_ to Mr. Fauntleroy, then  a flourishing banker in London. The riches of the banker were of a  doubtful character, however; some time afterward she was convicted of  forgery, and paid the penalty with his life. Affected by the ruin, but  not participating in the crime of Fauntleroy, she struggled bravely with  fate, and generally maintained a fair appearance in society both in  London and Paris. She shortly reappeared in her native county as Duchess  of Palata. At this time the fortunes of her family had reduced them to  be the occupants of a small cottage at Morton, and age rendering her  father incapable of active exertion, he filled the humble office of  rural postman. To her honor it should be recorded that she enabled her  parents to pass the remainder of their days in comfort. Six or seven  years ago she again visited her native place, a widow, his grace the  Duke of Palata having paid the debt of nature. Her mother she left at  Morton, paid the last duties to her father (somewhat ostentatiously),  and volunteered her assistance to promote the advancement of her female  relatives. Again, however, \"a change came o'er the spirit of her dream;\"  and some three or four years ago the public journals announced her  marriage to the son of an Irish clergyman of good family. In this  character, accompanied by her niece as _femme de chambre_, but not by  her husband, she once more visited Gainsborough and the scenes of her  youth; after making her mother an allowance, she again departed for  Italy, in good health; but death, which spares neither rank nor  character, has closed the \"last scene of all, in this strange eventful  history.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The author of the \"Nibelungenlied\" is unknown, and, whether it be the  work of one poet, of two, or twenty, is still a matter of doubt, among  German critics. That the Nibelungenlied has been extensively  interpolated, is, I believe, agreed on all hands; we may conclude as  much, from having reason to believe that it was handed down for some  time (how long, nobody knows for certain), by oral tradition, and what  effect such a state of things may have on popular poetry, we may readily  collect from what Bishop Percy and Sir Walter Scott have told us of the  variations in the old ballads of England and Scotland. Lachmann  attributes it to the thirteenth century.          Original Correspondence.          PARIS, DEC. 2, 1850.    FROM time immemorial, no one knows why (for the legends which recount  her history leave it doubtful whether she performed on any instrument),  St. Cecilia has been chosen by musicians as their patron saint; and the  musicians of Paris, on the approach of winter, always celebrate a mass,  in music, to her honor, and for the benefit of the distressed members of  their body. Not that they entertain any exaggerated idea of the  consoling powers of the musical art, or hope to relieve the positive  sufferings of poverty and destitution by any combination of sounds, no  matter how harmonious; but this festival being held in the church of St.  Eustache, the largest in Paris, and all lovers of music being so eager  to gain admission, that the immense aisles of this grand old pile (which  will contain five thousand persons), are always crowded to overflowing  on these occasions, every one paying a franc for his admission: the sum  thus gained, together with the collections taken up in the middle of the  service, by the committee of ladies chosen for that purpose (who go  round among the crowd, preceded by the beadle, and followed by two or  three attendant gentlemen, carrying a little embroidered bag of a  particular shape, used for that purpose, in which they receive the  contributions of the benevolent), constitute a fund, from which many an  unfortunate or superannuated brother of the tuneful craft obtains  relief.    This vast building, with its lofty arches, is admirably calculated for  the performance of grand religious compositions; the effect of the music  being enhanced by the aspect of the building, and the accessories of  sculpture, painting, and carving, which render this church one of the  richest in the capital.    To obtain places on any occasion of the kind, it is necessary to go an  hour or two in advance; and the gradual filling of the aisles is one of  the most curious scenes which a stranger can contemplate. As there are  no pews, each person, on entering, helps himself or herself to a chair,  which he holds aloft over the heads of his already seated neighbors, as  he slowly forces his way onward through their serried ranks, until he  espies some unappropriated gap into which he can insinuate his chair and  himself; the police and the beadles always taking care to keep a little  pathway, just large enough to squeeze through, open all through the  outer aisle that runs round the church. For the unfortunate people who  form the walls of this pathway, the process of filling is a severe  infliction; the uninterrupted stream of in-comers, forcing their way  along with a ruthless disregard of the shoulders of those between whom  they pass, is really, (especially when the in-comer happens to be a very  stout man, or a very fat lady, enveloped in an unusual quantity of  drapery,) almost overpowering. Every now and then the beadle comes  along, rapping his silver-headed cane on the pavement, and crying, \"Way,  there! keep out of the path!\" and escorting a party of privileged  individuals for whom seats have been reserved; and, as the beadle is  always tall and stout, and always forces his way through in defiance of  apparent impossibilities, a chorus of murmurs accompanies his progress.  The beadle is a very grand personage, and his appearance sufficiently  indicates this fact. He wears a cocked hat, covered with silver lace,  and decorated with nodding white plumes; a scarf of crimson velvet,  stiff with embroidery in silver thread, covers the upper part of his  person; black velvet smalls, fastened at the knee with silver buckles,  white silk stockings and gloves, and enormous buckles in his polished  shoes, complete his attire. He wears a massive silver chain round his  neck; and a sword hangs at his side to strike terror into the"]]]
