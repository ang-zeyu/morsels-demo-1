When I get the chance, I'll drop you a hint.\"    \"And now I must get this bag to my room without anyone seeing me,\" said  Fred.    \"Better let Spouter or Fatty carry it up,\" advised Jack. \"Then, if  Martell sees it, he won't know that it is your suitcase.\"    It was an easy matter to get Spouter to do what was required, although  he insisted upon knowing what was in the wind. When he was told, he,  too, laughed heartily.    \"It will serve Martell right,\" he said. \"I hope it worries him to  death.\"    As soon as the suitcase was safe in Fred's room, he sought out  Professor Brice, who was busy arranging the order of some classes.    \"I wish to report that I've got my suitcase back, Professor,\" said the  youth.    \"Ah, indeed!\" was the teacher's reply, and his face showed his relief.  \"I'm glad to know it. Did you--er--have any trouble?\"    \"Nothing that I care to mention--at least at this time,\" answered Fred.  \"If you don't mind, Professor, we'll drop the matter.\"    \"Oh, very well, Rover. Just as you please.\" The young professor looked  at Fred rather knowingly. \"Of course, if there is anything wrong, you  can report it later,\" he added hesitatingly.    \"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,\" answered the youth, and then bowed himself  out of the office. In the hallway he was joined by Andy.    \"Did he make you squeal?\" questioned the cousin quickly.    \"Not much!\" was the reply. \"He's a good sport. I guess he's been  through the mill himself.\"    Fred spent some time over the contents of the suitcase, brushing the  dirt from some of the articles and sorting the rest out to be cleaned  or laundered.    \"It's going to cost two or three dollars to fix this up,\" he declared  to Randy. \"I really ought to send the bill to Martell.\"    \"Well, just wait first and see if we get any fun out of this,\" answered  the joke-loving cousin.    As was to be expected, there was far from a full night's sleep coming  to the Rover boys that night. The quarters were strange to them, and  there was more or less noise throughout the school building, a bunch of  scholars coming in on a late train and not getting settled down until  after midnight. There was also something of horseplay, although the  majority of the cadets were too tired from their journeys to be very  active.    \"I suppose we'll have to stand some hazing and all that sort of thing  later on,\" remarked Jack before retiring.    About one o'clock the school seemed to settle down, and then one after  another the Rover boys fell asleep, not to awaken until the autumn sun  was showing well above the hills beyond Clearwater Lake.    \"This certainly is a splendid location,\" remarked Jack, as he went to  the open window, stretched himself, and filled his lungs with the fresh  morning air.    \"I don't wonder Colonel Colby picked this place out for a school,\"  answered Andy, who had come in. \"He couldn't have done better.\"    Not being accustomed to their surroundings, it took the Rovers a little  longer than usual to get washed and dressed. They were just finishing  their toilets when there came a light knock on Randy's door. He opened  it to find Walt Baxter standing there.    \"Nappy Martell just went downstairs, and I've fixed that matter up with  Ned Lowe,\" said Walt. \"Come on down if you want to see what takes  place.\"    He led the way, and all of the Rover boys followed at a safe distance.  They saw Walt enter one of the big living-rooms of the Hall, to one end  of which was attached the school library. Nappy Martell was at one of  the library tables glancing carelessly over a magazine. In the  living-room Walt was joined by Ned Lowe, and the pair walked up behind  Nappy.    \"Why, yes, it was the strangest thing I ever saw,\" said Walt to Ned in  a loud voice so that Nappy Martell could not help but hear. \"The fellow  seemed to come from a stack of cornstalks down in the cornfield.\"    \"It wasn't one of the cadets, was it?\" questioned Ned, innocently.    \"Oh, no. I think this fellow was some kind of a tramp--maybe some  fellow who had been sleeping under the stack all night. But what he was  doing with such a fine suitcase gets me.\"    \"That's right. Tramps don't generally have suitcases,\" returned the  other boy. \"Did he come toward the school?\"    \"No. He dug out the other way just as fast as he could go.\"    \"Poor fellow! maybe he was afraid if he came towards the school he  would be arrested. If he had a suitcase he couldn't have been just an  ordinary tramp. Maybe he was some working man looking for a job and  without the price of a night's lodging.\"    \"Perhaps, Ned. At the same time, I don't think Colonel Colby wants his  cornstalks used for a hotel,\" returned Walt; and then he and Ned walked  through the library and went outside on the campus.    During this conversation the Rover boys, hidden behind some open doors,  had watched Nappy Martell closely. They had seen that he had caught  what was being said and had immediately lost all interest in the  magazine he was perusing. His face took on a worried look, and he  glanced inquiringly after Walt and Ned. Then he threw down his magazine  and started to leave the room.    \"Come on, let us watch him,\" whispered Jack.    \"Yes. But keep out of his sight,\" returned Randy. \"We don't want this  joke spoiled.\"    Keeping well in the background, they saw Nappy Martell ascend the  stairs to his room. A moment later he came forth with his hat in his  hand.    \"I bet an oyster against a soda cracker he's going down to that  cornfield!\" cried Andy.    \"Right you are!\" answered Fred. \"Come on, let's follow him;\" and  rushing up to their own rooms the Rover boys donned their caps and  sweaters, for the day was unusually cool.    Nappy Martell left the Hall by a rear door, and the Rovers followed.  They saw the loudly dressed youth hurry toward the stable and then  disappear to the rear. Soon he was on the highway leading to the  cornfield.    \"There is no use of our following him, for he might see us and that  would spoil everything,\" said Randy. \"Let's wait here at the stable  until he comes back.\"    It did not take Nappy Martell long to reach the cornfield; and from a  distance the Rovers saw him rush around, first to one stack of  cornstalks and then to another. He was gone fully a quarter of an hour,  and came back looking decidedly worried.    \"He thinks some tramp got that suitcase and went off with it,\" said  Fred, grinning. \"Randy, that certainly was one great joke.\"    \"Don't say a word,\" answered Randy. \"Just let him keep on worrying for  a while. Maybe it will do him good.\"    As Martell passed the stable, the Rover boys stepped out of sight in  the building. They saw him re-enter the Hall, and then they took a  roundabout course which soon brought them to the campus, where they  joined Fatty and Ned.    \"It's certainly a good joke,\" was Fatty's comment. \"And any fellow who  would be mean enough to dirty a fellow's clothing like that ought to  suffer for it. Gee! I'll bet he's worried!\"    Of course, such a joke could not be kept entirely secret, and before  long it was spread among a good many of the cadets. But great care was  taken to keep it from Slugger Brown, Codfish and all the others  belonging to the Martell crowd.    \"And now to pay Martell back for his meanness!\" said Fred a little  later. \"This joke of Randy's is all right as far as it goes, but I  think I'm going to go him one better--that is, if I can get into  Martell's room.\"    \"All right, Fred. Anything you say goes,\" added Andy, quickly. \"Isn't  that so, Randy?\"    \"Sure thing!\"    \"Look here! You don't want to get into trouble,\" warned Jack.    \"There won't be much trouble about this,\" answered Fred. \"I am only  going to give Nappy Martell something to think about.\"          CHAPTER XII    LEARNING TO DRILL      While the Rover boys were talking matters over among themselves, Nappy  Martell had returned to his room, which was connected by a door with  that occupied by Slugger Brown.    \"What in thunder made you run off in such a hurry, Nappy?\" demanded the  other cadet somewhat surlily. \"You didn't answer that question I put to  you at all.\"    \"I had something else to think about,\" was the reply. \"It looks to me  as if I'm in hot water.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"Do you remember I told you that I placed that Fred Rover's suitcase  down under a stack in the cornfield?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I heard Walt Baxter telling Ned Lowe that he had seen a tramp  down in the cornfield running away from one of the stacks with a  suitcase in his hand; so I went down to the cornfield to find out if  the suitcase was still where I had hidden it. It was gone.\"    \"Whew!\" Slugger Brown gave a prolonged whistle. \"That certainly does  look bad. Did Baxter say where the tramp went?\"    \"He told Lowe that he had not come towards the Hall, but had gone off  in the opposite direction.\"    \"Then that looks as if the suitcase was gone for good.\"    \"So it does. And I don't know what I'm going to do about it,\" answered  Nappy Martell, gloomily. \"Of course, I didn't think the suitcase would  be stolen.\"    \"And the worst part of it is, the Rovers suspect you of having taken  it,\" was the comment of Slugger.    \"Yes. But they can't prove it,\" cried Nappy, quickly. \"That is, they  won't be able to do it unless you or Codfish give me away.\"    \"You know me well enough to know I won't say a word, Nappy. And as for  Codfish, just give him to understand if he opens his trap you'll fix  him for it.\"    A little while later Martell and Brown went below. In the lower hallway  they met Fred and some of the others.    \"Well, Martell, when are you going to return that suitcase?\" demanded  the youngest Rover.    \"I told you I haven't got your suitcase and don't know anything about  it,\" cried the loudly dressed youth. But at the same time his face grew  flushed and he could not look Fred in the eyes.    \""]]]
