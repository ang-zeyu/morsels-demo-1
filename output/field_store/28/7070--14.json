Considerable work was there done  upon it by Messrs. William Hill and Son in 1872, viz:        I. The pipes of Great and Choir stops were replanted, CC pipes over         the GG grooves, and the compass altered to CC to G throughout.       II. The following alterations were made in the Great organ:         Open Diapason (ii) extended from gamut G to CC.         Mixture replaced by new pipes where required.         New Trumpet inserted, and the old one transferred to Swell.      _Choir._ Dulciana (new) C (grooved).             Keraulophon (new) C (grooved).             Clarinet CC.      _Swell._ New soundboard (CC to G), swell-box and new action.             New Bourdon, 16 feet.             Cornet made into 12 and 15 feet.

All stops, except German Flute and Double Trumpet, carried               down to CC.      _Pedal._ Bourdon, new, 16 feet.             Open Diapason, 16 feet (compass arranged CCC to F thirty               notes).

Several alterations were then made in  the instrument to adapt it to its new position, and at the present time  the specification is as follows:        GREAT ORGAN, CC TO G.

He did not now keep his watch, nor take his \"trick at the helm,\"  except when he chose, and was altogether a privileged sort of a person,  or one of the \"idlers.\" His name was Jacobs, which afforded a pretext  for calling him \"Old Jack,\" with the sailor's fondness for that  Christian cognomen, which it is difficult to account for, unless because  Jonah and St. John were seafaring characters, and the Roman Catholic  holy clerk St. Nicholas was baptized \"Davy Jones,\" with sundry other  reasons good at sea. But Old Jack was, at any rate, the best hand for a  yarn in the Gloucester Indiaman, and had been once or twice called upon  to spin one to the ladies and gentlemen in the cuddy. It was partly  because of his inexhaustible fund of good humor, and partly from that  love of the sea which looked out through all that the old tar had seen  and undergone, and which made him still follow the bowsprit, although  able to live comfortably ashore. In his blue jacket, white canvas  trowsers edged with blue, and glazed hat, coming forward to the galley  to light his pipe, after serving the captain's tea of an evening, Old  Jack looked out over the bulwarks, sniffed the sharp sea-air, and stood  with his shirt-sleeve fluttering as he put his finger in his pipe, the  very embodiment of the scene--the model of a prime old salt who had  ceased to \"rough it,\" but could do so yet if needful.    \"Come, old ship!\" said the men near the windlass, as soon as Old Jack  came forward, \"give us a yarn, will ye?\"    \"Yarn!\" said Jack, smiling, \"what yarn, mates? 'Tis a fine night,  though, for that same--the clouds fly high, and she's balling off a good  ten knots sin' eight bells.\"    \"That she is, bo'--so give us a yarn now, like a reg'lar old A 1 as you  are!\" said one.    \"'Vast there, mate,\" said a man-o'-wars-man, winking to the  rest,--\"you're always a-cargo-puddling, Bill! D'ye think Old Jack  answers to any other hail nor the Queen's? I say, old three-decker in  or'nary, we all wants one o' your close-laid yarns this good night.  Whaling Jim here rubs his down with a thought over much o' the tar, an'  young Joe dips 'em in yallow varnish--so if you says Nay, why, we'll all  save our grog, and get drunk as soon as may be.\"    \"Well, well, mates,\" said Jack, endeavoring to conceal his flattered,  feelings, \"what is it to be, though?\"    \"Let's see,\" said the man-o'-war's-man--\"aye, give us the Green Hand!\"    \"Aye, aye, the Green Hand!\" exclaimed one and all. This \"Green Hand\" was  a story Old Jack had already related several times, but always with such  amusing variations, that it seemed on each repetition a new one--the  listeners testifying their satisfaction by growls of rough laughter, and  by the emphatic way in which, during a pause, they squirted their  tobacco-juice on the deck. What gave additional zest to this particular  yarn, too, was the fact of its hero being no less than the captain  himself, who was at this moment on the poop quarter-deck of the ship,  pointing out something to a group of ladies by the round-house--a tall,  handsome-looking man of about forty, with all the mingled gravity and  frank good humor of a sailor in his firm, weather-tinted countenance. To  have the power of secretly contrasting his present condition and manners  with those delineated by Old Jack's episode from the \"skipper's\"  previous biography, was the _acme_ of comic delight to these rude sons  of Neptune, and the narrator just hit this point.    \"Ye see,\" began he, \"tis about six an' twenty years gone since I was an  able seaman before the mast, in a small Indyman they called the Chester  Castle, lying at that time behind the Isle of Dogs, in sight of Grenidge  Hospital. She was full laden, but there was a strong breeze blowing up  that wouldn't let us get under weigh; and, besides, we waited for the  most part of our hands. I had sailed with the same ship two voyages  before; so,\" says the captain to me one day, \"Jacobs, there's a lady over  at Greenwich yonder wants to send her boy to sea in the ship--for a  sickening I s'pose. I am a going up to town myself,\" says he, \"so take  the quarter-boat and two of the boys and go ashore with this letter, and  see the young fool. From what I've heard,\" says the skipper, \"he's a  jackanapes as will give us more trouble than thanks. However, if you  find the lady's bent on it, why, she may send him aboard to-morrow if  she likes. Only we don't carry no young gentlemen; and if he slings his  hammock here, you must lick him into shape. I'll make a sailor of him or  a cabin-boy.\" \"Ay, ay, sir,\" says I, shoving the letter into my hat; so  in half an hour's time I knocks at the door of the lady's house, rigged  out in my best, and hands over the screed to a fat fellow with red  breeches and yallow swabs on his shoulders, like a captain of marines,  that looked frightened at my hail, for I thou't he'd been deaf by the  long spell he took before he opened the door. In five minutes I heard a  woman's voice ask at the footman if there was a sailor awaiting below.  \"Yes, marm,\" says he; and \"show him up,\" says she. Well, I gives a  scrape with my larboard foot, and a tug to my hair, when I gets to the  door of _such_ a fine room above decks, all full o' tables, an' chairs,  an' sofers, an' piangers, an' them sort o' highflying consarns. There  was a lady all in silks and satins on one of the sofers, dressed out  like a widow, with a pretty little girl as was playing music out of a  large book--and a picter of a man upon the wall, which I at once logged  it down for him she'd parted company from. \"Sarvint, ma'am,\" says I.  \"Come in, my good man,\" says the lady. \"You're a sailor?\" says  she--asking, like, to be sure if I warn't the cook's mate in dish-guise,  I fancy. \"Well, marm,\" I raps out, \"I make bould to say as I hopes I  am!\"--an' I catches a sight o' myself in a big looking-glass behind the  lady, as large as our sky-sail,--and, being a young fellow in them days,  thinks I, \"Blow me, if Betsy Brown asked me that now, I'd ask her if  _she_ was a _woman_!\" \"Well,\" says she, \"Captain Steel tells me in this  here letter, he's agoing to take my son.\" Now,\" says she, \"I'm sore  against it--couldn't you say some'at to turn his mind?\" \"The best way  for that, yer ladyship,\" says I, \"is to let him go, if it was only the  length of the Nore. The sea'll turn his stomack for him, marm,\" I says,  \"an' then we can send him home by a pilot.\" \"He wanted for to go into  the navy,\" says the lady again, \"but I couldn't think on that for a  moment, on account of this fearful war; an', after all, he'll be safer  in sailing at sea nor in the army or navy--don't you think so, my good  man?\" \"It's all you knows about it,\" thinks I; hows'ever, I said there  wasn't a doubt on it. \"Is Captain Steel a rash man?\" says she. \"How so,  marm?\" says I, some'at taken aback. \"I hope he does not sail at night,  or in storms, like too many of his profession, I'm afeard,\" says she; \"I  hope he always weighs the anchor in such cases, very careful.\" \"Oh, in  course,\" says I, not knowin', for the life of me, what she meant. I  didn't like to come the rig over the poor lady, seein' her so anxious  like; but it was no use, we was on such different tacks, ye see. \"O yes,  marm,\" I says, \"Captain Steel al'ays reefs taups'ls at sight of a squall  brewing to wind'rd; and we're as safe as a church, then, ye know, with a  man at the wheel as knows his duty.\" \"This relieves my mind,\" the lady  says, \"very much; but I couldn't think why she kept sniffing all the  time at her smelling bottle, as she wor agoin to faint. \"Don't take it  to heart so, yer ladyship,\" I says at last; \"I'll look after the young  gentleman till he finds his sea-legs.\" \"Thank you,\" says she; \"but, I  beg your pardon, would you be kind enough for to open the winder, and  look out if you see Edward? I think he's in the garding. I feel sich a  smell of pitch and tar!\" I hears her say to the girl; and says she to me  again, \"Do you see Edward there?--call to him, please.\" Accordingly, I  couldn't miss sight of three or four young slips alongside, for they  made plenty of noise--one of 'em on top of a water-barrel smoking a  cigar; another singing out inside of it for mercy; and the rest roaring  round about it, like so many Bedlamites. \"No wonder the young scamp  wants to go to sea,\" thinks I, \"he's got nothin' arthly to do but  mischief.\" \"Which is the young gentleman, marm?\" says I, lookin' back  into the room--\"Is it him with the cigar and the red skull-cap?\" \"Yes,\"  says the lady--\"call him up, please.\" \"Hallo!\" I sings out, and all runs  off but him on the barrel, and \"Hallo!\" says he. \"You're wanted on deck,  sir,\" I says; and in five minutes in comes my young gemman, as grave as  you please. \"Edward,\" says the mother, \"this is one of Captain Steel's  men.\" \"Is he going to take me?\" says the young fellow, with his hands in  his pockets. \"Well, sir,\" I says, \"'tis a very bad look-out, is the sea,  for them as don't like it. You'll be sorry ten times over you've left  sich a berth as this here afore you're down Channel.\" The young chap  looks me all over from clue to earing, and says he, \"My mother told you  to say that!\" \"No sir,\" says I, \"I says it on my own hook.\" \"Why did you  go yourself then?\" says he. \"I couldn't help it,\" answers I. \"Oh,\" says  the impertinent little devil, \"but you're only one of the common  sailors, ain't you?\" \"Split me, you little beggar?\""]]]
