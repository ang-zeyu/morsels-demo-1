LETTER I.         _On the opening of the Port of Agadeer, or Santa Cruz in Suse, and       of its Cession by the Emperor Muley Yezzid, to the Dutch._         TO JAMES WILLIS, ESQ.         (Late British Consul for Senegambia) Eversholt, near Woburn,       Bedfordshire.         Mogodor, 28th February, 1792.         The emperor has consented to the proposition of the Dutch       government, to open the port of Agadeer, or Santa Cruz, in the       province of Suse, to the commerce of that nation; and I have       finally resolved to establish a house there, so soon as the sultan       Yezzid's order respecting that port shall reach the hands of Alkaid       Aumer ben Daudy, the governor of this port. There are various       political intrigues in agitation, to deter me from going personally  56   to establish the commerce of this most desirable and long-neglected       port of Santa Cruz. The governor anticipates a considerable       diminution in the treasury of Mogodor; and the merchants of this       place anticipate a great diminution of the various articles of       produce of this fine country, seeing that the principal articles of       exportation from the empire of Marocco are produced in the province       of Suse, and in the neighbourhood of Santa Cruz.         The stream of commerce will, therefore, necessarily be converted       from Mogodor to Santa Cruz. The merchants of Fas also, who have       their establishments and connections at Timbuctoo, and in other       parts of Sudan, will resort to Santa Cruz in preference to Mogodor,       for all European articles calculated for the markets of Sudan, the       former port being in the neighbourhood of the desert, or Sahara,       and at a convenient distance from Akka in Lower Suse, the general       rendezvous of the akkaba, (or accumulated caravans,) destined for       the interior regions of Africa or Sudan. This akkaba starts       annually for Timbuctoo, consisting of 2000 or 3000 camels, loaded       with merchandise from Fas, Tetuan, Sallee, Mogodor, Marocco,       Tafilelt, Draha, and Terodant. The port of Santa Cruz is hence  57   aptly denominated _Beb Sudan_, i.e. the gate or entrance of Sudan.       The port of Santa Cruz was formerly farmed by the emperor[94] Muley       Ishmael, to some European power, for 50,000 dollars a-year, as I       have been informed; others say it was purchased of him by his own       Jewish subjects, for the purposes of trade. However this may have       been, no advantage was ever taken of the favourable opportunity       then offered, of opening and securing to Europe an extensive and       lucrative trade with the various countries of Sudan or Nigritia.         I can account for this omission only by supposing that the interior       of Africa was then less known than even it now is; and that the       merchants then established at Santa Cruz, had there sufficient       advantages in commerce to engage their attention, without examining       into this immense undiscovered mine of wealth!             [Footnote 94: Great-grandfather of Muley Soliman, the present           emperor, who is denominated Soliman ben Muhamed ben Abdallah           ben Ismael.]  58         LETTER II.         _The Author's arrival at Agadeer or Santa Cruz.--He opens the Port       to European Commerce.--His favourable Reception on landing       there.--Is saluted by the Battery.--Abolishes the degrading Custom       that had been exacted of the Christians, of descending from on       Horseback, and entering the Town on Foot, like the Jews.--Of a       Sanctuary at the Entrance of the Town, which had ever been       considered Holy Ground, and none but Muhamedans had ever before       been permitted to enter the Gates on Horseback._         TO THE SAME.         Santa Cruz, 7th March, 1792.         _The emperor's[95] letter ordering the port of Santa Cruz to be       opened to the Dutch_, having reached Mogodor, and having received       my instructions from Webster Blount, Esq. Dutch consul-general to       this empire, to act as agent for him at that port, until my       appointment be ratified and confirmed by the States General, of       which he informs me there is no doubt, I proceeded hither in the       Snell Zee Post, Dirk Morris, master; and after being becalmed off       (Affernie) Cape de Geer, I arrived here the third morning after my       departure from Mogodor. I sent my horses by land; and on our  59   approach to the shore, I discovered them approaching the mountain       on which Santa Cruz stands. Soon after we came to anchor in the       road, the boats came off, and the battery, which is situated about       half-way up the mountain on the western declivity, saluted me with       8 guns, (the Muhamedans always saluting with an even number.) This       compliment being unexpected, we were about half an hour preparing       to return it, when we saluted the battery with 9 guns. The captain       of the port received me with great courtesy, and was ordered by the       bashaw El Hayanie, governor of Santa Cruz, to pay the most       unqualified attention to my wishes. I landed amidst an immense       concourse of people, assembled on the beach to witness the       re-establishment of their port, most of whom were without shoes,       and very ill clad.             [Footnote 95: See specimens of Arabic epistolary           correspondence, Appendix, Letter 9th.]         The most hearty exclamations of joy and approbation were manifested       by the people when I landed; a merchant was come to establish, once       more, that commerce by which the fathers of the present generation       had prospered; and their sons appeared to know full well the       advantages that again awaited their industry, which for 30 years       had not been exercised. I mounted my horse on the beach, amidst the       general acclamations of the people, and ascended the mountain, on       the summit of which is the town. On my arrival at the gate, I was       courteously received by the bashaw's sons; who, however, informed  60   me that the entrance of Santa Cruz was ever considered holy ground,       and that Christians, during its former establishment, always       descended and entered the town on foot, intimating at the same time       that it was expected I should do the same. I had been before       cautioned by Mr. Gwyn, the British consul at Mogodor, not to       expostulate at this request, as it would certainly be required of       me to conform to ancient usages. But I knew too well the       disposition of the people, and the great desire that pervaded all       ranks to have the port established; I therefore turned my horse,       and told the bashaw's sons, that I was come, with the blessing of       God, to bring prosperity to the land, to make the poor rich, and to       improve the condition and multiply the conveniences of the opulent;       that I came to establish commerce for _their_ advantage, not for       mine; that it was indifferent to me whether I returned to Mogodor       or remained with them. The sons of the bashaw became alarmed, and       entreated me, with clasped hands, to wait till they should report       to the bashaw my words and observations. I consented, and soon       after they returned with their father's earnest request that I       should enter a-horseback: old customs, said the venerable old       bashaw when, immediately afterwards, I met him in the street; old       customs are abolished, enter and go out of this town a-horseback or       a-foot, we desire the prosperity of this port, and that its       commerce may flourish; _All the people of Suse hail you as their  61   deliverer, God has sent you to us to turn the desert into_ (jinen       afia) _a fruitful garden; come, and be welcome, and God be with       you._         I was conducted to the best house in the town, a house which       belonged to our predecessor, Mr. Grover; and I was informed, that       if any demur had been made by the bashaw respecting my entrance       through the sanctuary or holy ground, it might have caused an       immediate insurrection; so anxious and impatient were all ranks of       people for the new establishment of this eligible port of Suse.         The privilege thus established, of riding in and out of the town, I       continued; and I procured it immediately afterwards for all       Christians! even masters of ships and common sailors.  62         LETTER III.         _The Author makes a Commercial Road down the Mountain, to       facilitate the Shipment of Goods.--The Energy and Liberality of the       Natives, in working gratuitously at it.--Description of the       Portuguese Tower at Tildie.--Arab Repast there.--Natural Strength       of Santa Cruz, of the Town of Aguzem, and the Portuguese Spring and       Tank there.--Attempt of the Danes to land and build a       Fort.--Eligibility of the Situation of Santa Cruz, for a Commercial       Depot to Supply the whole of the Interior of North Africa with East       India and European Manufactures.--Propensity of the Natives to       Commerce and Industry, if Opportunity offered._         TO THE SAME.         Santa Cruz, 20th March, 1792.         The road up the mountain of Santa Cruz was so dangerous and       impassable, that I undertook to repair it; accordingly, I agreed       with a Shilluh to make it safe and convenient for transporting       goods for shipment; and such was the eager desire of the people for       the establishment of the port, that hundreds brought stones and       assisted gratuitously in the construction of this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],[0,"A Middle High German Primer (#14)"],[1," which originally had reduplicated  preterites. The present and past participle have the same stem-vowel;  and the preterite singular and plural have {ie}. In OHG. the verbs which  had {a, [a]} or {ei} in the present had {ia} (older {ea, [e]}) in the  preterite; and those which had {ou ([o])}, {uo} in the present had {io}  (older {eo}) in the preterite. But in MHG. the {ia} and {io} regularly  fell together in {ie} (Sec. 11, 3), so that all the preterites had {ie}.      bannen, _to banish_   bien    bienen    gebannen    halten, _to hold_     hielt   hielten   gehalten    sl[a]fen, _to sleep_    slief   sliefen   gesl[a]fen    hei[z]en, _to call_     hie[z]    hie[z]en    gehei[z]n    loufen, _to run_      lief    liefen    geloufen    ruofen, _to call_     rief    riefen    geruofen    And similarly {halsen}, _to embrace_, {salzen}, _to salt_, {spalten},  _to split_, {spannen}, _to span_, {vallen}, _to fall_, {valten}, _to  fold_, {wallen}, _to bubble_; {b[a]gen}, _to quarrel_, {bl[a]sen}, _to  blow_, {br[a]ten}, _to roast_, {l[a][z]en} (see also Sec. 99), _to let_,  _leave_, {r[a]ten}, _to advise_; {mei[z]en}, _to cut_, {scheiden}, _to  separate_, {sweifen}, _to rove_; {b[o][z]en}, _to strike_, {st[o][z]en},  _to push_, {houwen} (pret. {hiu} and {hie}, pl. {hiuwen}, {hiewen}),  _to hew_, {wuofen}, _to bewail_.      g[a]n, g[e]n, _to go_          gienc (gie)  giengen  (ge)gangen    h[a]hen (Sec. 29) }    h[a]n (Sec. 38)   }, _to hang_   hienc (hie)  hiengen  gehangen    v[a]hen (Sec. 29) }    v[a]n (Sec. 38)   }, _to catch_  vienc (vie)  viengen  gevangen    erren, ern, _to plough_    ier          ieren     gearn    On the interchange between {h} and {ng}, see Sec. 30; {erren}, {ern} from  older {*arjan}.      B. WEAK VERBS.    Sec. 88.    The OHG. weak verbs were divided into three great classes according as  the infinitive ended in {-en} from older {*-jan}, {-on}, or {-[e]n}.

Sec. 31, 3). The  former formed their preterite in {-ta}, and the latter in {-ita}; and  similarly in the inflected form of the past participle. In MHG. all the  unaccented vowels {i, e}, {a, o}, {u, [i]}, {[e], [o]} regularly fell together  in {e} (Sec. 7), so that the old distinction between the endings of the  three classes of verbs was to a great extent obliterated. The OHG. verbs  with a short stem-syllable belonging to Classes II and III came in MHG.  to be inflected entirely like sub-division (_b_) of Class I; and those  with a long stem-syllable mostly came to be inflected like sub-division  (_a_) of Class I, see Secs. 9,2, 92.    Owing to all the OHG. unaccented vowels being weakened to {e} the MHG.  endings are:--                          Sing.                   Plur.    Pres. Indic.:   -e, -es(t), -et        -en, -et, -ent      \"    Subj.:   -e, -es(t), -e         -en, -et, -en      Pret.

Final {-n} in the first pers. sing. of the pres. indicative of the old  Classes II and III remained in early MHG., but during the MHG. period  the first person was remodelled after the analogy of Class I.      NOTE.--Old forms with {[)o]} ({u}) for later {e} occasionally occur in    verbs originally belonging to the OHG. Class II; and in like manner    {[)i]} for {e} in the pret. subjunctive.      Sec. 89.    The MHG. weak verbs are divided into two classes, according as the  preterite is formed in {-te} or {-ete} (see however Sec. 40). The inflexion  of the present is the same in both classes.      CLASS I.    Sec. 90.    To this class belong (1) verbs which have old long stem-syllables. Those  having a mutated vowel in the present have the corresponding unmutated  vowel in the preterite. The {i} which would have caused umlaut in the  preterite disappeared in the prehistoric period of the language. The  past participle generally has two forms: one with a mutated vowel, and  the other without it, properly from the old inflected form which did not  have umlaut. (2) Verbs having a short stem-vowel followed by a single  consonant ({l, r}), and trisyllabic verbs containing an {l, n}, or {r}  in the second syllable, as {zeln}, older {zellen} (Sec. 31,3), _to count_,  pret. {zelte} beside {zalte}, p.p. {gezelt} beside {gezalt}; {nern}, _to  rescue_, pret. {nerte} (OHG. {nerita}), p.p. {genert}; and similarly  {doln} (OHG. {dol[o]n}), _to tolerate_, {seln}, _to hand over_, {spiln},  _to play_, {weln}, _to choose_; {wern}, _to defend_; {wandeln} (OHG.  {wantal[o]n}), _to change_, pret. {wandelte}; {vordern} (OHG. {fordar[o]n}),  _to further_, pret. {vorderte}; {s[e:]genen} (OHG. {s[e:]gan[o]n}), _to bless_,  pret. {s[e:]gente}.
