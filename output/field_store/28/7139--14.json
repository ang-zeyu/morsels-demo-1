[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#14)"],[1,"great epic ascribed to Valmiki,  a poet who in course of time has passed from the realm of history into  that of myth, like many other Hindus. The poem, as it has come down to  us, contains seven books, which relate the following tale. Dasa-ratha,  King of Ayodhya (now Ajodhya, near Faizabad), of the dynasty which  claimed descent from the Sun-god, had no son, and therefore held the  great _Asva-medha_, or horse-sacrifice, as a result of which he  obtained four sons, Rama by his queen Kausalya, Bharata by Kaikeyi,  and Lakshmana and Satrughna by Sumitra. Rama, the eldest, was also  pre-eminent for strength, bravery, and noble qualities of soul.  Visiting in his early youth the court of Janaka, king of Videha, Rama  was able to shoot an arrow from Janaka's bow, which no other man could  bend, and as a reward he received as wife the princess Sita, whom  Janaka had found in a furrow of his fields and brought up as his own  daughter. So far the first book, or Bala-kanda. The second book, or  Ayodhya-kanda, relates how Queen Kaikeyi induced Dasa-ratha, sorely  against his will, to banish Rama to the forests in order that her son  Bharata might succeed to the throne; and the Aranya-kanda then  describes how Rama, accompanied by his wife Sita and his faithful  brother Lakshmana, dwelt in the forest for a time, until the demon  King Ravana of Lanka, by means of a trick, carried off Sita to his  city. The Kishkindha-kanda tells of Rama's pursuit of Ravana and his  coming to Kishkindha, the city of Sugriva, the king of the apes, who  joined him as an ally in his expedition; and the Sundara-kanda  describes the march of their armies to Lanka, which is identified with  Ceylon, and their crossing over the straits. Then comes the  Yuddha-kanda, which narrates the war with Ravana, his death in battle,  the restoration of Sita, the return of Rama and Sita to Ayodhya, and  the crowning of Rama in place of Dasa-ratha, who had died of grief  during his exile. Finally comes the Uttara-kanda, which relates that  Rama, hearing some of the people of Ayodhya spitefully casting  aspersions on the virtue of Sita during her imprisonment in the palace  of Ravana, gave way to foolish jealousy and banished her to the  hermitage of Valmiki, where she gave birth to twin sons, Kusa and  Lava; when these boys had grown up, Valmiki taught them the Ramayana  and sent them to sing it at the court of Rama, who on hearing it sent  for Sita, who came to him accompanied by Valmiki, who assured him of  her purity; and then Sita swore to it on oath, calling upon her mother  the Earth-goddess to bear witness; and the Earth-goddess received her  back into her bosom, leaving Rama bereaved, until after many days he  was translated to heaven.    Such is the tale of Rama as told in the Valmiki-ramayana--a clean,  wholesome story of chivalry, love, and adventure. But clearly the  Valmiki-ramayana is not the work of a single hand. We can trace in it  at least two strata. Books II.-VI. contain the older stratum; the rest  is the addition of a later poet or series of poets, who have also  inserted some padding into the earlier books. This older stratum, the  nucleus of the epic, gives us a picture of heroic society in India at  a very early date, probably not very long after the age of the  Upanishads; perhaps we shall not be far wrong if we say it was  composed some time before the fourth century B.C. In it Rama is simply  a hero, miraculous in strength and goodness, but nevertheless wholly  human; but in the later stratum--Books I. and VII. and the occasional  insertions in the other books--conditions are changed, and Rama  appears as a god on earth, a partial incarnation of Vishnu, exactly as  in the Bhagavad-gita and other later parts of the Mahabharata the hero  Krishna has become an incarnation of Vishnu also. The parallel may  even be traced further. Krishna stands to Arjuna in very much the same  relation as Rama to his brother Lakshmana--a greater and a lesser  hero, growing into an incarnate god and his chief follower. This is  thoroughly in harmony with Hindu ideas, which regularly conceive the  teacher as accompanied by his disciple and abhor the notion of a voice  crying in the wilderness; indeed we may almost venture to suspect that  this symmetry in the epics is not altogether uninfluenced by this  ideal. This, however, is a detail: the main point to observe is that  Rama was originally a local hero of the Solar dynasty, a legendary  king of Ayodhya, and as the Puranas give him a full pedigree, there is  no good reason to doubt that he really existed \"once upon a time.\" But  the story with which he is associated in the Ramayana is puzzling. Is  it a pure romance? Or is it a glorified version of some real  adventures? Or can it be an old tale, perhaps dating from the early  dawn of human history, readapted and fitted on to the person of an  historical Rama? The first of these hypotheses seems unlikely, though  by no means impossible. The second suggestion has found much favour.  Many have believed that the story of the expedition of Rama and his  army of apes to Lanka represents a movement of the Aryan invaders from  the North towards the South; and this is supported to some extent by  Indian tradition, which has located most of the places mentioned in  the Ramayana, and in particular has identified Lanka with Ceylon. In  support of this one may point to the Iliad of Homer, which has a  somewhat similar theme, the rape and recovery of Helen by the armies  of the Achaeans, the basis of which is the historical fact of an  expedition against Troy and the destruction of that city. But there  are serious difficulties in the way of accepting this analogy, the  most serious of all being the indubitable fact that there is not a  tittle of evidence to show that such an expedition was ever made by  the Aryans. True, there were waves of emigration from Aryan centres  southward in early times; but those that travelled as far as Ceylon  went by sea, either from the coasts of Bengal or Orissa or Bombay.  Besides, the expedition of Rama is obviously fabulous, for his army  was composed not of Aryans but of apes. All things considered, there  seems to be most plausibility in the third hypothesis[30]. Certainly  Rama was a local hero of Ayodhya, and probably he was once a real  king; so it is likely enough that an old saga (or sagas) attached  itself early to his memory. And as his fame spread abroad, principally  on the wings of Valmiki's poem, the honours of semi-divinity began to  be paid to him in many places beyond his native land, and about the  beginning of our era he was recognised as an incarnation of Vishnu  sent to establish a reign of righteousness in the world. In Southern  India this cult of Rama, like that of Krishna, has for the most part  remained subordinate to the worship of Vishnu, though the Vaishnava  church there has from early times recognised the divinity of both of  them as embodiments of the Almighty. But its great home is the North,  where millions worship Rama with passionate and all-absorbing love.    [Footnote 30: I regret that I cannot accept the ingenious hypothesis  lately put forward by Rai Saheb Dineshchandra Sen in his _Bengali  Ramayanas_. The story of the Dasaratha-jataka seems to me to be a  garbled and bowdlerised snippet cut off from a possibly pre-Valmikian  version of the old Rama-saga; the rest of the theory appears to be  quite mistaken.]      III. SOME LATER PREACHERS    With all its attractions and success, the new Krishnaism did not  everywhere overgrow the older stock upon which it had been engrafted.  There were many places in which the early worship of Vishnu and  Vasudeva remained almost unchanged. The new legends of Krishna's  childhood might indeed be accepted in these centres of conservatism,  but they made little difference in the spirit and form of the worship,  which continued to follow the ancient order. In some of them the  Bhagavad-gita, Narayaniya, and other epic doctrinals still remained  the standard texts, which theologians connected with the ancient  Upanishads and the Brahma-sutra summarising the latter; in other  centres there arose, beginning perhaps about the seventh century A.D.,  a series of Samhitas, or manuals of doctrine and practice for the  Pancharatra[31] sect, which, though in essentials agreeing with the  Narayaniya, taught a different theory of cosmogony and introduced the  worship of the goddess Sri or Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, as the  agency or energy through which the Supreme Being becomes active in  finite existence; and in yet other places other texts were followed,  such as those of the Vaikhanasa school. This worship of  Vishnu-Vasudeva on the ancient lines was peculiarly vigorous among the  representatives of Aryan culture in the South, who had introduced the  cults of Vishnu and Siva with the rest of the Aryan pantheon into the  midst of Dravidian animism. Hinduism, transplanted into the Dravidian  area, has there remained more conservative than anywhere else, and has  clung firmly to its ancient traditions. There is nothing of Dravidian  origin in the South Indian worship of Vishnu and Siva; they are  entirely Aryan importations. But they have become thoroughly  assimilated in their southern home, and each of them has produced a  huge mass of fine devotional literature in the vernaculars. In the  Tamil country the church of Vishnu boasts of the Nal-ayira-prabandham,  a collection of Tamil psalms numbering about 4,000 stanzas composed by  twelve poets called Alvars, which were collected about 1000 A.D.;  and the worship of 'Siva is equally well expressed in the Tiru-murai,  compiled about the twelfth century, of which one section, the Devaram,  was put together about the same time as the Nal-ayira-prabandham. Both  the Tiru-murai and the Nal-ayira-prabandham breathe the same spirit of  ecstatic devotion as the Bhagavata-purana; they are the utterances of  wandering "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#14)"],[1,"have chosen. The  headman proclaimed that his will coincided with the will of the  native teacher. They wanted a church built that would compare  favorably with churches erected under the auspices of other  native teachers and other headmen.    'The contributions came in plentifully, sylvan or grassy. People  who never come to church, heathens who do not seem much overjoyed  with the Gospel, gave just as handsomely as Church officers. No  one was paid. The church is cheap and big, and the headman and  native teacher are both unhealthily contented.'    'Well, what's the matter?' said Manners; 'it's the way we do  these little things in Africa. White men don't build churches  from base to spire on ideal principles exactly, do they. Bishop?'    'At least we haven't had a cafe chantant lately,' the Bishop  said.    'Well, don't you be too sure one isn't going on in some outlying  parish while we sit here. As it happens, I know of one advertised  for next month.'    'Be sure of your facts,' said the Bishop.    'Anyhow, before you came, plenty of the society lash used to be  applied to get church-building doles out of Europeans. Moreover,  if you look into it, generally you'll find things at Missions  much as you find them here. These gloriously \"given\" Mission  churches on Mission lands that the home magazine ecstasizes over  are not given so very freely, to say the least of it. They are  put up by a sort of social pressure immensely effective,'  Topready broke in.    'They say most of the churches this side of the river are built  the one way and I don't like the one way. Archdeacon Maynard used  to advocate the one way, and impress it on his missionaries black  and white. It was he who started the church-rate and debarred  defaulters from Easter Communion. I've stopped that, and I want  to stop the one way.'    The Bishop groaned. 'Archdeacon Maynard's a vice-president of the  Free and Open Churchmen in England. I heard him speak eloquently,  if a little floridly, on the right of the poor to the House of  God.'    Manners chuckled. 'England's some way off,' he said.    Topready spoke from his heart. 'I don't like it. I told the  people that the proper way was for Christians and philo-Christians  to build accordingly as they could spare money and time. But they  said that they were too few. I answered \"Then let them wait in the old  church awhile.\" They said they wanted a new church this year, and that  the heathen should be called to help the faithful as in other places.  They said they ought to have a kraal levy as other places did it saved  a great deal of trouble.  They thought me mad, I think. Azariah, the  teacher, practically told me so.'    The Bishop lit his pipe again.    'We'll think about it,' he said. 'The consecration is fixed for  the day after to-morrow, is it not? It was to be christened Holy  Innocents' Church on Childermas Day, was it not? Will you have it  consecrated on the Eve instead, Saint John's Night? Time Sunset.'    Topready started. 'Rather late, is it not?' he asked.    It was a great concourse that lined the hillside on the morrow  when the sun was going down. The Bishop had spoken that morning  in the old plain church of how he wished them to observe certain  days of prayer and thanksgiving.    He asked them to keep a festival of flocks on Saint Agnes' Day.    He asked them to keep a festival of herds on Saint Luke's Day.    He asked them to keep the feasts of Loaf-Mass in August and  Wood-Mass in September as feasts of Harvest and Forestry.    He asked them to keep a thanksgiving for summer after Christmas  on the night of Saint John, if they and their priest thought  good.    He spoke of how the heathen had worshipped the sun in the grey  northern lands. Then Christians better taught had thanked Christ,  the Light of the World, for the glory of the sun, and lighted  their joy-fires to a better purpose.    Doubtless, some in this land long ago, not only at Zimbabwe, but  on many hills and high places, had honored the strong sun of the  South. He asked them as Christians to be glad for that same sun's  blessings at Christmas time. It seemed to him good for those who  wished it (he gave no law) for those to light their bonfires  to-night and to thank God not only for the summer, but for the Sun  of righteousness. He himself had a mind to light a fire on that  Saint John's Night to the glory of God.    Topready looked thoughtful after church. 'If I adopt your  calendar loyally as far as may be, do you see your way to help me  against the system?' he asked of a sudden. His grey-blue eyes  were full of fight.    The Bishop nodded. He talked with him quietly a little while.    'The pact is made, then?' said Topready. 'No, I don't think we  have sold our convictions, either of us. I don't feel penitent  about my side of the bargain.'    'I feel it's a holy alliance,' said the Bishop, and his face  glowed. 'People will keep this night, and remember what was done  on it, may be, long after we are forgotten.'    That sunset a mighty crowd was there among the rocks. Much dead  wood had been brought. Fathers, mothers, and children in costumes  that ranged from skins to European fashions shouldered or headed  their faggots.' A grim thought obsessed the Bishop as he watched  them. These people, so quiet and yielding as to the selling of  sacrament, and levying of church vote how easily they might be  swayed to more sinister reminiscences of the Middle Ages! If he  and Topready and Azariah and the headman enjoined it, what would  save certain aged heathen neighbors from an auto-da-fe for  alleged witchcraft one of these nights? Were not some of those  old scenes at the stake much like this scene before him? Did not  country people come together much as these, with dark impassive  faces and bundles of firewood? Did not they listen and listen so,  until the time came to pile faggots to the glory of God?    He stood on a rock and looked down on the faces. Topready stood  close beneath him looking cheerful, the native teacher was near  looking dubious, next to him stood the headman with his white  beard, looking amused. Around them the crowd poised and posed  itself among the rocks with innate grace and imposing silence.  Even the babies in the goatskins were quiet.    The Bishop spoke of alms-giving. He said he did not like their  plan of raising a house for Christ. Let people who loved Christ  build churches if they wished to, but let them build churches  according to their power to give! Let them not seek the labor or  money of others, careless how it came! Rather let them worship in  the old and the small, than build a new and great church anyhow!  He, their Bishop, wished to buy their new church from them,  paying back those who had helped to build, giving to each his  due. He asked them, would they sell this church to him, to do  with it as seemed to him good? If, when they built, they had  made, as it were, a false start, let them start again, and this  time so run that they might obtain the Promises of Christ. Would  they sell their church to him?    He waited for an answer.    There was a hush. The eyes that watched him seemed almost  overwhelming in their vigilance.    His eyes went wistfully off to the sky in front of him. What  beaches of gold and weed-tangles of rose-color those were to the  north-west the way of England.    Suddenly the silence was broken.    Azariah spoke out bravely. He had heard the words of his  herdsman, and he knew that he had' gone astray, even like a lost  bull. As for this thatched cattle-byre that they had built, let  him who asked for it have it! Was it not his own?    One after another spoke. Their speeches all had the same import  let the church be handed over to him that asked.    A roar of acclamation worth many speeches went up from the  hill-side Then the Bishop asked those who carried faggots to follow  him to the consecration. His shepherd's staff went before him. An  earthen vessel smoked with incense in front of that again. He  followed up the steep path in his shining robes. Behind him came  blazing grass torches, and behind them again wood-carriers. When  they reached the hill's crown there was some delay in the  gathering dusk. They were stacking the wood for the sacrifice. At  last Topready turned to his chief with a happy face. All was  prepared. The Bishop's voice rang out in one sonorous prayer of  oblation. Then someone handed him a grass torch and he kindled  the thatch above the altar. The church that misbegotten innocent  flamed up toward heaven amber and grey and crimson under the  stars.        EIGHT-EIGHT IN LAVENDER        Andrew Vine came out to Africa this year as a pilgrim, and was  disappointed. He did not go about his pilgrimage in the right way  to my thinking. For to begin with, on his own confession, he put  himself in the hands of a born organizer, who was making up a  party of fellow-travelers.    Of course they were provided with first-class tickets for the  boat, and enjoyed for sixteen days and more, in a same and narrow  scene, an amplitude of the luxuries they were used to, and tired  of. Then, dogged by a diet befitting that state to which it had  pleased Providence to call them, they rode the Great North Road  for some days in a northern express. Vine said that the Victoria  Falls were all right, but that their surroundings were, many of  them, perversely wrong. It was so very stale, the hotel business,  with the moonlight river excursions and the Livingstone trips,  far too much sleeked and smoothed by foresight, and tamed by  taking of thought. If one had only traveled up with pack donkeys,  provisioned with leathery meat and leathery damper! For Vine had  known better times in Africa. He had known pioneer adventures in  his headstrong youth but had fallen out of his Column after three  crowded months. Tempted of fever, he had made a great refusal.  And now in this year, twenty-four years after, the sense of"]]]
