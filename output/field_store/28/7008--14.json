Jesus chose the latter of the two courses, and we may well imagine  that it was not at Golgotha that he had the first occasion to cry out,  \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do!\"    In the case of Jesus, the whole paradoxical thought of his being the  vicarious sin-offering and world redeemer can best be understood as the  solution, proposed in the Deutero-Isaiah, of the question which had  occupied Job--to wit: Why must the innocent suffer? If the maimed in  body refuse to consider himself as forsaken by his God, as a sinner  punished for some guilt of which he is unconscious, he cannot but assume  that there is such a thing as a vocation to suffering, and believe in  the inscrutable plan of salvation in which his own life and sufferings  are called upon to play some part. Nothing but this conviction of being  thus elected can afford him the desired compensation for his depressed  and hampered ego.    A repressed nature of this type will, in seeking such a compensation,  escape from the harsh reality into the realm of dreams. This is the  basis of what the physician recognizes in hysteria, and in the mental  disease termed \"Dementia Praecox.\" The glorious daydreams of the  millennium, the time of bliss when all strife and all hate will  disappear from the earth, when all the crooked will be made straight,  find their best explanation in this peculiarity. They console the  suffering and heavy-laden for the bitter reality which, in the light of  the old messianic prophecies, appears only as a nightmare, promptly to  be chased away by the dawn of a new day, a new, a perfect era. The  Davidic Jesus, in spite or rather because of his servile form, feels  that he is himself the secret incognito king of that wonderful realm,  the monarch whom God some time in the future, nay, right here and before  the passing of the present generation, will transform while at the same  time \"revealing\" his kingdom.    It is but natural that in the mental development of such individuals  they should seek to be great, glorious, and to achieve the supernatural,  since they, themselves, are denied the ordinary satisfactions. If, in  addition, such individuals believe that they have had a divine call, if  the disability of the body so preys on the mind that the sensitive  structure gives way to delusions, then there results an aberration from  the normal and usual processes of thought,--to be sure not the rabid,  violent form of mental disease, but yet a deviation from the normal  manner of thinking. Such was the case with the Prophet Jesus.    Afflicted in body but endowed with a sensitive mind, exposed to an  unusual environment of seething unrest and political ferment, and firmly  convinced in the current fancies regarding the approaching destruction  of the world, the conquest of the Evil Power, and the Reign of God,  Jesus became the subject of a delusion that he was the only true Messiah  who had been presaged by the prophets of old.    The greatest difficulty encountered in every attempt to present the life  and work of Jesus according to the evidence of his own words preserved  in the sources is the sharp, irreconcilable contradiction between the  so-called \"fire and sword\" sayings on the one side, and the beatitudes  on the peacemakers and the meek, the prohibition to kill, to be angry,  to resist wrong, and the command to love one's enemy, contained in the  Sermon on the Mount, on the other.    In the early period of his messianic career, the period of the Sermon on  the Mount, Jesus was a thorough quietist. But if we realize that the  delusion that he was \"The Messiah\" had entered his mind so vehemently  that he firmly believed that the end of the world was imminent, and that  it was his duty to save as many as possible, we can understand his  acquiescence to the violence which followed.    Moreover, he was clearly forced to the fatal road by the idea that he  must set on foot a movement of hundreds of thousands, the picture of the  exodus from Egypt with the fantastic figures given in the Old Testament.  The Messianic rising he was to initiate could not be regarded as  realized if he left the country with a band of some hundred elect. If he  wished, however, to put at least two-fifths of the population in motion,  the method of sending out messengers had proved altogether  unsatisfactory. He must try the effect of his own words in a place  where, and at a time when, he was sure to reach the greatest multitude  of his people. That could only be in Jerusalem, at the time of the great  pilgrimage at the feast of the Passover. Moreover, the desired result  could only be obtained of course if he openly proclaimed himself to be  the Messiah.    Then it was that the Prophet of quiet reversed his words and armed his  disciples. Jesus was fully aware of the illegality of this arming of his  disciples and of his own direction to purchase a weapon; none the less,  he saw no escape from this bitter necessity. The prediction of the  prophet must be fulfilled, according to which the righteous servant of  the Lord must be numbered among the lawless transgressors. True it is  that he did not lead the revolt himself, but tarried with his disciples  at the Last Supper at a house near by the fighting. When he becomes  aware that his secret hiding place on the Mount of Olives has been  betrayed, Jesus hopes for a miracle from God up to the last. Captured,  he is led away to the palace of the high priest's family on the Mount of  Olives, where, while Jesus is questioned by the high priest, Peter,  unrecognized, warms himself at the fire in the courtyard and thrice  denies his master. He was then taken to the Roman governor's  court-martial, where sentence was passed and he was led off to the place  of execution and there deserted by all his followers except a few  Galilean women. Then was heard the last despairing cry of the desolate,  dying martyr, \"My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?\"    Thus ended the career of this deformed Prophet with the sensitive  deluded mind; a martyr who attempted only to effect reforms amongst his  own people, in his own small locality.      MOSES    With regard to the life, the deeds, and the words of the Prophet Moses  we have no history; only myth and legend. The existence of Moses is not  demonstrated by the Biblical books which are falsely ascribed to him,  yet we cannot be certain that such a character did not exist. In any  event, we must judge his character from the writings ascribed to him.    The legend of the child cast upon the waters is to be found in the  folklore of all nations. This legend, concerning Moses, relates that one  day Pharaoh's daughter, while bathing with her maids in the Nile, found  a Hebrew child exposed on the waters in obedience to a new decree. She  adopted the boy, gave him an Egyptian name, and brought him up in her  palace as a prince. She had him educated and the fair inference is that  he was schooled in the culture of the Egyptians. The royal lady made of  the Hebrew slave-child an Egyptian gentleman.    Yet, although his face was shaved, and outwardly he appeared to be an  Egyptian, at heart he remained a Hebrew. One day, when he was grown,  Moses went slumming among his own people to look at their burdens, and  he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew. He was so overcome by passion at  this scene that he killed the man on the spot. The crime became known,  there was a hue and cry raised, and the king had a search made for Moses  with the intention of slaying him. With all hope of a career in Egypt  ended, Moses escaped to the Peninsula of Sinai, and entered the family  of an Arab sheik.    The Peninsula of Sinai lies clasped between two arms of the Red Sea. It  is a wilderness of mountains covered with a thin, almost transparent  coating of vegetation which serves as pasture to the Bedouin flocks.  Among the hills that crown the high plateau there is one which at the  time of Moses was called the \"Mount of God.\" It was holy ground to the  Egyptians, and also to the Arabs, who ascended as pilgrims and drew off  their sandals when they reached the top. Now is it strange that Sinai  should have excited reverence and dread? It is indeed a weird land. Vast  and stern stand the mountains, with their five granite peaks pointing to  the sky. Avalanches like those of the Alps, but of sand, not of snow,  rush down their naked sides with a clear tinkling sound. A peculiar  property resides in the air, the human voice can be heard at a  surprising distance and swells out into a reverberating roar, and  sometimes there rises from among the hills a dull booming sound like the  distant firing of heavy guns.    Let us attempt to realize what Moses must have felt when he was driven  out of Egypt into such a harsh and rugged land. Imagine this man, the  adopted son of a royal personage, who was accustomed to all the splendor  of the Egyptian court, to the busy turmoil of the streets of the  metropolis, to reclining in a carpeted gondola or staying with a noble  at his country house. In a moment all is changed. He dwells in a tent,  alone on the mountain side, a shepherd with a crook in his hand. He is  married to the daughter of a barbarian; his career is at an end.    He realizes that never again will he enter that palace where once he was  received with honor, where now his name is uttered only with contempt.  Never again will he discourse with grave and learned men in his favorite  haunts, and never again will he see the people of his tribe whom he  loves and for whom he endures this miserable fate. They will suffer but  he will not help them; they will mourn, but he will not hear them. In  his dreams he hears and sees them. He hears the whistling of the lash  and the convulsive sobs and groans. He sees the poor slaves toiling in  the fields and sees the daughters of Israel carried off to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#14)"],[1,"quarterly\"...    \"From--from\"...    \"From me!\" said Mr. Gianapolis, smiling radiantly. \"Now, I know you  are going to accept; that is understood between us. I will give you the  address--Palace Mansions, Westminster--at which you must apply; and I  will tell you what little services will be required from you in return  for this additional emolument.\"    Mr. Soames hurriedly finished his second cocktail. Mr. Gianapolis, in  true sporting fashion, kept pace with him and repeated the order.    \"You will take charge of the mail!\" he whispered softly, one irregular  eye following the movements of the barmaid, and the other fixed almost  fiercely upon the face of Soames. \"At certain times--of which you will  be notified in advance--Mrs. Leroux will pay visits to Paris. At such  times, all letters addressed to her, or re-addressed to her, will not  be posted! You will ring me up when such letters come into your  possession--they must ALL come into your possession!--and I will arrange  to meet you, say at the corner of Victoria Street, to receive them. You  understand?\"    Mr. Soames understood, and thus far found his plastic conscience  marching in step with his inclinations.    \"Then,\" resumed Gianapolis, \"prior to her departure on these occasions,  Mrs. Leroux will hand you a parcel. This also you will bring to me at  the place arranged. Do you find anything onerous in these conditions?\"    \"Not at all,\" muttered Soames, a trifle unsteadily; \"it seems all  right\"--the cocktails were beginning to speak now, and his voice was a  duet--\"simply perfectly all right--all square.\"    \"Good!\" said Mr. Gianapolis with his radiant smile; and the gaze of  his left eye, crossing that of its neighbor, observed the entrance of a  stranger into the bar. He drew his stool closer and lowered his voice:    \"Mrs. Leroux,\" he continued, \"will be in your confidence. Mr. Leroux and  every one else--EVERY ONE else--must not suspect the arrangement\"...    \"Certainly--I quite understand\"...    \"Mrs. Leroux will engage you this afternoon--her husband is a mere  cipher in the household--and you will commence your duties on Monday.  Later in the week, Wednesday or Thursday, we will meet by appointment,  and discuss further details.\"    \"Where can I see you?\"    \"Ring up this number: 18642 East, and ask for Mr. King. No! don't  write it down; remember it! I will come to the telephone, and arrange a  meeting.\"    Shortly after this, then, the interview concluded; and later in the  afternoon of that day Mr. Soames presented himself at Palace Mansions.    He was received by Mrs. Leroux--a pretty woman with a pathetically weak  mouth. She had fair hair, not very abundant, and large eyes; which,  since they exhibited the unusual phenomenon, in a blonde, of long dark  lashes (Mr. Soames judged their blackness to be natural), would have  been beautiful had they not been of too light a color, too small in the  pupils, and utterly expressionless. Indeed, her whole face lacked  color, as did her personality, and the exquisite tea-gown which she  wore conveyed that odd impression of slovenliness, which is often an  indication of secret vice. She was quite young and indisputably pretty,  but this malproprete, together with a certain aimlessness of manner,  struck an incongruous note; for essentially she was of a type which for  its complement needs vivacity.    Mr. Soames, a man of experience, scented an intrigue and a neglectful  husband. Since he was engaged on the spot without reference to the  invisible Leroux, he was immediately confirmed in the latter part of  his surmise. He departed well satisfied with his affairs, and with  the promise of the future, over which Mr. Gianapolis, the cherubic,  radiantly presided.          XIII    THE DRAFT ON PARIS      For close upon a month Soames performed the duties imposed upon him  in the household of Henry Leroux. He was unable to discover, despite  a careful course of inquiry from the cook and the housemaid, that Mrs.  Leroux frequently absented herself. But the servants were newly engaged,  for the flat in Palace Mansions had only recently been leased by the  Leroux. He gathered that they had formerly lived much abroad, and that  their marriage had taken place in Paris. Mrs. Leroux had been to visit  a friend in the French capital once, he understood, since the housemaid  had been in her employ.    The mistress (said the housemaid) did not care twopence-ha'penny for her  husband; she had married him for his money, and for nothing else. She  had had an earlier love (declared the cook) and was pining away to a  mere shadow because of her painful memories. During the last six months  (the period of the cook's service) Mrs. Leroux had altered out of all  recognition. The cook was of opinion that she drank secretly.    Of Mr. Leroux, Soames formed the poorest opinion. He counted him a  spiritless being, whose world was bounded by his book-shelves, and whose  wife would be a fool if she did not avail herself of the liberty which  his neglect invited her to enjoy. Soames felt himself, not a snake in  the grass, but a benefactor--a friend in need--a champion come to the  defense of an unhappy and persecuted woman.    He wondered when an opportunity should arise which would enable him  to commence his chivalrous operations; almost daily he anticipated  instructions to the effect that Mrs. Leroux would be leaving for Paris  immediately. But the days glided by and the weeks glided by, without  anything occurring to break the monotony of the Leroux household.    Mr. Soames sought an opportunity to express his respectful readiness to  Mrs. Leroux; but the lady was rarely visible outside her own apartments  until late in the day, when she would be engaged in preparing for  the serious business of the evening: one night a dance, another, a  bridge-party; so it went. Mr. Leroux rarely joined her upon these  festive expeditions, but clung to his study like Diogenes to his tub.    Great was Mr. Soames' contempt; bitter were the reproaches of the cook;  dark were the predictions of the housemaid.    At last, however, Soames, feeling himself neglected, seized an  opportunity which offered to cement the secret bond (the TOO secret  bond) existing between himself and the mistress of the house.    Meeting her one afternoon in the lobby, which she was crossing on the  way from her bedroom to the drawing-room, he stood aside to let her  pass, whispering:    \"At your service, whenever you are ready, madam!\"    It was a non-committal remark, which, if she chose to keep up the  comedy, he could explain away by claiming it to refer to the summoning  of the car from the garage--for Mrs. Leroux was driving out that  afternoon.    She did not endeavor to evade the occult meaning of the words, however.  In the wearily dreamy manner which, when first he had seen her, had  aroused Soames' respectful interest, she raised her thin hand to her  hair, slowly pressing it back from her brow, and directed her big eyes  vacantly upon him.    \"Yes, Soames,\" she said (her voice had a faraway quality in keeping with  the rest of her personality), \"Mr. King speaks well of you. But please  do not refer again to\"--she glanced in a manner at once furtive and  sorrowful, in the direction of the study-door--\"to the ... little  arrangement of\"...    She passed on, with the slow, gliding gait, which, together with her  fragility, sometimes lent her an almost phantomesque appearance.    This was comforting, in its degree; since it proved that the smiling  Gianapolis had in no way misled him (Soames). But as a man of business,  Mr. Soames was not fully satisfied. He selected an evening when Mrs.  Leroux was absent--and indeed she was absent almost every evening, for  Leroux entertained but little. The cook and the housemaid were absent,  also; therefore, to all intents and purposes, Soames had the flat to  himself; since Henry Leroux counted in that establishment, not as an  entity, but rather as a necessary, if unornamental, portion of the  fittings.    Standing in the lobby, Soames raised the telephone receiver, and having  paused with closed eyes preparing the exact form of words in which he  should address his invisible employer, he gave the number: East 18642.    Following a brief delay:--    \"Yes,\" came a nasal voice, \"who is it?\"    \"Soames! I want to speak to Mr. King!\"    The words apparently surprised the man at the other end of the wire, for  he hesitated ere inquiring:--    \"What did you say your name was?\"    \"Soames--Luke Soames.\"    \"Hold on!\"    Soames, with closed eyes, and holding the receiver to his ear, silently  rehearsed again the exact wording of his speech. Then:--    \"Hullo!\" came another voice--\"is that Mr. Soames?\"    \"Yes! Is that Mr. Gianapolis speaking?\"    \"It is, my dear Soames!\" replied the sing-song voice; and Soames,  closing his eyes again, had before him a mental picture of the radiantly  smiling Greek.    \"Yes, my dear Soames,\" continued Gianapolis; \"here I am. I hope you are  quite well--perfectly well?\"    \"I am perfectly well, thank you; but as a man of business, it has  occurred to me that failing a proper agreement--which in this case I  know would be impossible--a trifling advance on the first quarter's\"...    \"On your salary, my dear Soames! On your salary? Payment for the first  quarter shall be made to you to-morrow, my dear Soames! Why ever did you  not express the wish before? Certainly, certainly!\"...    \"Will it be sent to me?\"    \"My dear fellow! How absurd you are! Can you get out to-morrow evening  about nine o'clock?\"    \"Yes, easily.\"    \"Then I will meet you at the corner of Victoria Street, by the hotel,  and hand you your first quarter's salary. Will that be satisfactory?\"    \"Perfectly,\" said Soames, his small eyes sparkling with avarice. \"Most  decidedly, Mr. Gianapolis. Many thanks.\"...    \"And by the way,\" continued the other, \"it is rather fortunate that you  rang me up this evening, because it "]]]
