Solam nam perfidus ille    te colere, arcanos etiam tibi credere sensus;    sola viri mollis aditus et tempora noras.    I, soror, atque hostem supplex adfare superbum:    non ego cum Danais Troianam exscindere gentem    Aulide iuravi, classemve ad Pergama misi,    nec patris Anchisae cineres Manisve revelli,    cur mea dicta neget duras demittere in auris.    Quo ruit?  Extremum hoc miserae det munus amanti:    exspectet facilemque fugam ventosque ferentis.    Non iam coniugium antiquum, quod prodidit, oro,    nec pulcro ut Latio careat regnumque relinquat:    tempus inane peto, requiem spatiumque furori,    dum mea me victam doceat fortuna dolere.    Extremam hanc oro veniam---miserere sororis---    quam mihi cum dederit, cumulatam morte remittam.'      Talibus orabat, talisque miserrima fletus    fertque refertque soror:  sed nullis ille movetur    fletibus, aut voces ullas tractabilis audit;    fata obstant, placidasque viri deus obstruit auris.    Ac, velut annoso validam cum robore quercum    Alpini Boreae nunc hinc nunc flatibus illinc    eruere inter se certant; it stridor, et altae    consternunt terram concusso stipite frondes;    ipsa haeret scopulis, et, quantum vertice ad auras    aetherias, tantum radice in Tartara tendit:    haud secus adsiduis hinc atque hinc vocibus heros    tunditur, et magno persentit pectore curas;    mens immota manet; lacrimae volvuntur inanes.      Tum vero infelix fatis exterrita Dido    mortem orat; taedet caeli convexa tueri.    Quo magis inceptum peragat lucemque relinquat,    vidit, turicremis cum dona imponeret aris,    horrendum dictu, latices nigrescere sacros,    fusaque in obscenum se vertere vina cruorem.    Hoc visum nulli, non ipsi effata sorori.    Praeterea fuit in tectis de marmore templum    coniugis antiqui, miro quod honore colebat,    velleribus niveis et festa fronde revinctum:    hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis    visa viri, nox cum terras obscura teneret;    solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo    saepe queri et longas in fletum ducere voces;    multaque praeterea vatum praedicta priorum    terribili monitu horrificant.  Agit ipse furentem    in somnis ferus Aeneas; semperque relinqui    sola sibi, semper longam incomitata videtur    ire viam, et Tyrios deserta quaerere terra.    Eumenidum veluti demens videt agmina Pentheus,    et solem geminum et duplicis se ostendere Thebas;    aut Agamemnonius scaenis agitatus Orestes    armatam facibus matrem et serpentibus atris    cum fugit, ultricesque sedent in limine Dirae.      Ergo ubi concepit furias evicta dolore    decrevitque mori, tempus secum ipsa modumque    exigit, et, maestam dictis adgressa sororem,    consilium voltu tegit, ac spem fronte serenat:    'Inveni, germana, viam---gratare sorori---    quae mihi reddat eum, vel eo me solvat amantem.    Oceani finem iuxta solemque cadentem    ultimus Aethiopum locus est, ubi maxumus Atlas    axem humero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum:    hinc mihi Massylae gentis monstrata sacerdos,    Hesperidum templi custos, epulasque draconi    quae dabat, et sacros servabat in arbore ramos,    spargens umida mella soporiferumque papaver.    Haec se carminibus promittit solvere mentes    quas velit, ast aliis duras immittere curas,    sistere aquam fluviis, et vertere sidera retro;    nocturnosque movet Manis:  mugire videbis    sub pedibus terram, et descendere montibus ornos.    Testor, cara, deos et te, germana, tuumque    dulce caput, magicas invitam accingier artes.    Tu secreta pyram tecto interiore sub auras    erige, et arma viri, thalamo quae fixa reliquit    impius, exuviasque omnis, lectumque iugalem,    quo perii, superimponas:  abolere nefandi    cuncta viri monumenta iuvat, monstratque sacerdos.'    Haec effata silet; pallor simul occupat ora.    Non tamen Anna novis praetexere funera sacris    germanam credit, nec tantos mente furores    concipit, aut graviora timet, quam morte Sychaei:    ergo iussa parat.      At regina, pyra penetrali in sede sub auras    erecta ingenti taedis atque ilice secta,    intenditque locum sertis, et fronde coronat    funerea; super exuvias ensemque relictum    effigiemque toro locat, haud ignara futuri.    Stant arae circum, et crines effusa sacerdos    ter centum tonat ore deos, Erebumque Chaosque,    tergeminamque Hecaten, tria virginis ora Dianae.    Sparserat et latices simulatos fontis Averni,    falcibus et messae ad lunam quaeruntur aenis    pubentes herbae nigri cum lacte veneni;    quaeritur et nascentis equi de fronte revolsus    et matri praereptus amor.    Ipsa mola manibusque piis altaria iuxta,    unum exuta pedem vinclis, in veste recincta,    testatur moritura deos et conscia fati    sidera; tum, si quod non aequo foedere amantes    curae numen habet iustumque memorque, precatur.      Nox erat, et placidum carpebant fessa soporem    corpora per terras, silvaeque et saeva quierant    aequora:  cum medio volvuntur sidera lapsu,    cum tacet omnis ager, pecudes pictaeque volucres,    quaeque lacus late liquidos, quaeque aspera dumis    rura tenent, somno positae sub nocte silenti    [lenibant curas, et corda oblita laborum].    At non infelix animi Phoenissa, nec umquam    Solvitur in somnos, oculisve aut pectore noctem    accipit:  ingeminant curae, rursusque resurgens    saevit amor, magnoque irarum fluctuat aestu.    Sic adeo insistit, secumque ita corde volutat:    'En, quid ago?  Rursusne procos inrisa priores    experiar, Nomadumque petam conubia supplex,    quos ego sim totiens iam dedignata maritos?    Iliacas igitur classes atque ultima Teucrum    iussa sequar?  Quiane auxilio iuvat ante levatos,    et bene apud memores veteris stat gratia facti?    Quis me autem, fac velle, sinet, ratibusve superbis    invisam accipiet?  Nescis heu, perdita, necdum    Laomedonteae sentis periuria gentis?    Quid tum, sola fuga nautas comitabor ovantes,    an Tyriis omnique manu stipata meorum    inferar, et, quos Sidonia vix urbe revelli,    rursus agam pelago, et ventis dare vela iubebo?    Quin morere, ut merita es, ferroque averte dolorem.    Tu lacrimis evicta meis, tu prima furentem    his, germana, malis oneras atque obicis hosti.    Non licuit thalami expertem sine crimine vitam    degere, more ferae, tales nec tangere curas!    Non servata fides cineri promissa Sychaeo!'      Tantos illa suo rumpebat pectore questus.    Aeneas celsa in puppi, iam certus eundi,    carpebat somnos, rebus iam rite paratis.    Huic se forma dei voltu redeuntis eodem    obtulit in somnis, rursusque ita visa monere est---    omnia Mercurio similis, vocemque coloremque    et crinis flavos et membra decora iuventa:    'Nate dea, potes hoc sub casu ducere somnos,    nec, quae te circum stent deinde pericula, cernis,    demens, nec Zephyros audis spirare secundos?    Illa dolos dirumque nefas in pectore versat,    certa mori, varioque irarum fluctuat aestu.    Non fugis hinc praeceps, dum praecipitare potestas?    Iam mare turbari trabibus, saevasque videbis    conlucere faces, iam fervere litora flammis,    si te his attigerit terris Aurora morantem.    Heia age, rumpe moras.  Varium et mutabile semper    femina.'  Sic fatus, nocti se immiscuit atrae.      Tum vero Aeneas, subitis exterritus umbris,    corripit e somno corpus, sociosque fatigat:    'Praecipites vigilate, viri, et considite transtris;    solvite vela citi.  Deus aethere missus ab alto    festinare fugam tortosque incidere funes    ecce iterum stimulat.  Sequimur te, sancte deorum,    quisquis es, imperioque iterum paremus ovantes.    Adsis o placidusque iuves, et sidera caelo    dextra feras.'  Dixit, vaginaque eripit ensem    fulmineum, strictoque ferit retinacula ferro.    Idem omnes simul ardor habet, rapiuntque ruuntque;    litora deseruere; latet sub classibus aequor;    adnixi torquent spumas et caerula verrunt.      Et iam prima novo spargebat lumine terras    Tithoni croceum linquens Aurora cubile.    Regina e speculis ut primum albescere lucem    vidit, et aequatis classem procedere velis,    litoraque et vacuos sensit sine remige portus,    terque quaterque manu pectus percussa decorum,    flaventesque abscissa comas, 'Pro Iuppiter, ibit    hic' ait 'et nostris inluserit advena regnis?    Non arma expedient, totaque ex urbe sequentur,    deripientque rates alii navalibus?  Ite,    ferte citi flammas, date vela, impellite remos!---    Quid loquor, aut ubi sum?  Quae mentem insania mutat?    Infelix Dido, nunc te facta impia tangunt.    Tum decuit, cum sceptra dabas.---En dextra fidesque,    quem secum patrios aiunt portare Penates,    quem subiisse umeris confectum aetate parentem!    Non potui abreptum divellere corpus, et undis    spargere?  Non socios, non ipsum absumere ferro    Ascanium, patriisque epulandum ponere mensis?---    Verum anceps pugnae fuerat fortuna:---fuisset.    Quem metui moritura?

The Bretons are brave soldiers and good sailors; their disposition is  hasty and violent, and even ferocious in anger. When the people of Nantes  rose up in rebellion against Duke Francis, his brother-in-law, the Comte  du Foix, sent to pacify them, said to him on his return from his mission,  \"J'aimerais mieux etre prince d'un million de sangliers que de tel peuple  que sont vos Bretons\"--Brittany has always been the theatre of great  virtues and great crimes.    On Sunday we went to the Welsh Baptist Chapel, to hear Mr. Jenkins preach  in the Breton language. He has been there thirty years zealously labouring  among the peasants, to convert whom he was sent by the Welsh Baptist  Missionary Society. From his thorough knowledge of the French and Breton  languages, he is eminently fitted for the task. He travels about the  surrounding country preaching, and establishing schools, and has revised  the Breton(9) translation of the New Testament for the Society, and  circulated, by means of colporteurs, from eight to nine thousand Bibles,  besides above 100,000 tracts. The task of acquiring the Breton language is  less difficult for a Welshman, for the similarity between them is so great  that the two people are able to make themselves understood to each other.  The labours of Mr. Jenkins have lately awakened the attention of the  Breton Roman Catholic clergy, who have publicly denounced him from their  altars, but without causing him to slacken in the good work he has  undertaken. Persecuted by a tyrannical priesthood, who hold dominion over  a peasantry bigoted in proportion to their ignorance, his position is one  of difficulty and danger; but he goes on with undrooping energy, convinced  that, though the progress is slow, the good seed has not been sown in  vain, and will, in due time, bear fruit, though those who first sowed it  may have passed away. There were about a dozen Bretons at the evening  service; they seemed to be constantly going in and out, as if unable to  keep up their attention to so long a service. There are also English  Protestant chapels at Morlaix and Quimper, and French at Brest and  Lorient.    We saw a christening in the cathedral, of a child about eighteen months  old; the mother wore a wonderful conical cap of lace.    A few houses from our hotel a ball was going on, given every week for the  workpeople of the town. The clatter of their iron-pointed wooden shoes  seemed quite to drown the music.    Next day we walked to the Fontaine des Anglais, so-called from the  slaughter of a body of English at that place. Jealous of the prosperity of  Morlaix, Henry VIII. sent a fleet up the river to attack the place, and  the commander, being informed by a spy of the absence of the chief nobles  at Guingamp, and of the townsmen at the fair of Pontivy, landed with a  force which entered Morlaix, burnt it, and returned laden with booty to  their boats. Six or seven hundred men, who were intoxicated, fell asleep  in the wood, where they were attacked by the nobles, who had hastened from  Guingamp to the assistance of the town, and were all massacred. The  neighbouring fountain, said to have been tinged with the invaders' blood,  received in memory of the event the name of \"Fontaine des Anglais.\" It was  on this occasion the town of Morlaix added to its arms, a lion (emblem of  vigilance), encountering a two-headed leopard (for England), with the  punning motto, \"S'ils te mordent, mors-les\" (Morlaix).    Emile Souvestre, author of 'Le Foyer Breton,' and 'Les Derniers Bretons,'  the ablest portrayer of Breton manners, customs, and superstitions, was a  native of Morlaix; he died in the Protestant Communion, 1854.    We were recommended to sail down the Morlaix River to its mouth, as the  scenery is very picturesque, but we had not time to effect it. The great  beauty of Brittany generally consists in its river scenery, the Rance, to  Dinan; the rivers of Quimper and Quimperle; the Aven, Elorn, and Blavet,  are all highly picturesque and worth visiting. Our next drive was to St.  Pol de Leon, partly along the bank of the river, passing under the church  of Notre Dame-de-la-Salzette and the convent below of St. Francois. The  tall steeples of St. Pol are seen at a great distance, and looking behind  is the best view of the Mene-Bre, an insulated conical mountain, one of  the Mene-Arre chain, situated near the station of Belle-Isle-Begard. A  chain of mountains runs through the Cotes-du-Nord, and, at the western end  of the department, forks off into two branches which traverse the whole of  Finistere,--the Mene-Arre, or northern chain, and the Montagnes Noires, or  southern.    St. Pol looks like a town of the Middle Ages. \"The holy city,\" as it is  called by the Leonnais, one of the four bishoprics(10) into which Brittany  was divided, comprising the modern districts of Morlaix and Brest. The  Pays de Leon is remarkable for the number of its religious monuments, its  fine churches, its bone-houses, calvaries, way-side crosses, and shrines.  Crosses are set up in every direction, and of every description, from the  plain unpretending simple cross of wood or stone, to the huge crosses  flaunting in green paint, with tears of gold--specimens of the taste of the  maire or priest of the district. No Breton passes the sacred symbol  without kneeling to salute it, and making the sign of the cross--evidence  that the piety of those who first raised them has not degenerated in their  posterity. The country is rich and varied. The Leonnais is tallest of all  the Breton race; his dress is generally black or blue, with a coloured  scarf round his waist, his hair is worn very long, and his broad-brimmed  hat has a silver buckle.  He is grave, of a calm confiding faith, which  nothing can shake or alter, and of intense religious feeling.  The church  is the place of meeting, where all his business is transacted, all his  aspirations centered. Throughout Brittany the priesthood are low and  ignorant. Like the Irish, the Breton farmer's great ambition is to make  his son a priest. In no part of France are they more uneducated than in  Brittany.    St. Pol is still and melancholy, the grass grows in the streets, the city  looks as if it had not awakened since its palmy days of the fourteenth  century. Its churches, calvaries, cemeteries, all silent as death--                     \"A deep, still pool in the ocean of life.\"    Its lively neighbour, Morlaix, offers a strange contrast: its inhabitants  may well say they are three hundred years in advance of St. Pol.    The pride of St. Pol de Leon is the church of Notre Dame-de-Creizker. Its  steeple, nearly 400 feet high, was said by Vauban to be the boldest piece  of architecture he ever beheld. It is built in the centre of the church,  entirely of granite, cut in the shape of tiles and open work, to within  eighty feet from the base. According to the legend, on the spot where the  church now stands, there lived in the time of St. Genevroc, a young girl,  whom the saint found, when passing her house on the fete of our Lady,  employed at her needle. He reproached her gently with her impiety, yet she  went on sewing, saying \"she required food on Sundays as well as on work  days.\" But the girl has hardly finished speaking, when all her body became  cold and motionless as a stone. She was completely paralysed. Asking  pardon of St. Genevroc, he made the sign of the cross upon each of her  limbs, and the power of motion returned. Grateful for her recovery, she  gave to the saint, her house, which was situated in the middle of the town  (as its name implies), as a site for his church. It is said to have been  built by an English architect, invited to Brittany by Mary Plantagenet,  daughter of Edward III., and first wife of Duke John IV.(11)    The axis of the nave is inclined to the left, a mystic allusion to the  position of the head of the expiring Saviour on the cross. _Et inclinato  capite, emise spiritum_, \"And He bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\"  The north porch of the Creizker is beautifully sculptured with leaves of  the mallow, the vine, and mulberry. It was all under repair when we saw  it.    [Illustration: 22. The Creizker.]    The cathedral has two fine towers with spires, and a magnificent rose  window of the fifteenth century in the south transept, with, above, the  \"fenetre d'excommunication.\" The fine porch, lightly and delicately  sculptured, is surmounted by a balustrade, whence the episcopal  benediction was given. Over the high altar is a large wooden crosier,  gilt, from which to suspend the ciborium, similar to that we saw in the  cathedral of Dol. A black marble slab, at the foot of the steps of the  high altar, marks the grave of St. Pol de Leon, who died 570. St. Pol, the  patron bishop and founder of the cathedral, was one of the clergy of Great  Britain who emigrated to Brittany in the sixth century; he landed in the  island of Ouessant, and passed on to the country of Leon, where he founded  a monastery. The island of Batz was, at that time, infested by an enormous  dragon, sixty feet long; the saint, accompanied by a warrior, entered the  cavern of the monster, tied his stole round its neck, and gave him to his  companion to lead, St. Pol following, beating him with his stick, till  they arrived at the extremity of the island, when he took off the stole,  and commanded the dragon to throw itself in the sea, an order the animal  immediately obeyed. St. Pol is always represented with the dragon by his  side, the stole round its neck. We were shown a little bell, said to have  belonged to the"]]]
