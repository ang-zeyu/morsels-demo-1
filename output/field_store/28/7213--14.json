Although I speak of reason, I am fully aware that reason alone will  not suffice. Old prisoners do not willingly leave their cells. We  shall see whether the youth whom we need are at our command--the  youth, who irresistibly draw on the old, carry them forward on strong  arms, and transform rational motives into enthusiasm.          _II. The Jewish Question_      No one can deny the gravity of the situation of the Jews. Wherever  they live in perceptible numbers, they are more or less persecuted.  Their equality before the law, granted by statute, has become  practically a dead letter. They are debarred from filling even  moderately high positions, either in the army, or in any public or  private capacity. And attempts are made to thrust them out of business  also: \"Don't buy from Jews!\"    Attacks in Parliaments, in assemblies, in the press, in the pulpit, in  the street, on journeys--for example, their exclusion from certain  hotels--even in places of recreation, become daily more numerous. The  forms of persecutions varying according to the countries and social  circles in which they occur. In Russia, imposts are levied on Jewish  villages; in Rumania, a few persons are put to death; in Germany, they  get a good beating occasionally; in Austria, Anti-Semites exercise  terrorism over all public life; in Algeria, there are travelling  agitators; in Paris, the Jews are shut out of the so-called best  social circles and excluded from clubs. Shades of anti-Jewish feeling  are innumerable. But this is not to be an attempt to make out a  doleful category of Jewish hardships.    I do not intend to arouse sympathetic emotions on our behalf. That  would be foolish, futile, and undignified proceeding. I shall content  myself with putting the following questions to the Jews: Is it not  true that, in countries where we live in perceptible numbers, the  position of Jewish lawyers, doctors, technicians, teachers, and  employees of all descriptions becomes daily more intolerable? Is it  not true, that the Jewish middle classes are seriously threatened? Is  it not true, that the passions of the mob are incited against our  wealthy people? Is it not true, that our poor endure greater  sufferings than any other proletariat? I think that this external  pressure makes itself felt everywhere. In our economically upper  classes it causes discomfort, in our middle classes continual and  grave anxieties, in our lower classes absolute despair.    Everything tends, in fact, to one and the same conclusion, which is  clearly enunciated in that classic Berlin phrase: \"_Juden Raus!_\" (Out  with the Jews!)    I shall now put the Question in the briefest possible form: Are we to  \"get out\" now and where to?    Or, may we yet remain? And, how long?    Let us first settle the point of staying where we are. Can we hope for  better days, can we possess our souls in patience, can we wait in  pious resignation till the princes and peoples of this earth are more  mercifully disposed towards us? I say that we cannot hope for a change  in the current of feeling. And why not? Even if we were as near to the  hearts of princes as are their other subjects, they could not protect  us. They would only feel popular hatred by showing us too much favor.  By \"too much,\" I really mean less than is claimed as a right by every  ordinary citizen, or by every race. The nations in whose midst Jews  live are all either covertly or openly Anti-Semitic.    The common people have not, and indeed cannot have, any historic  comprehension. They do not know that the sins of the Middle Ages are  now being visited on the nations of Europe. We are what the Ghetto  made us. We have attained pre-eminence in finance, because mediaeval  conditions drove us to it. The same process is now being repeated. We  are again being forced into finance, now it is the stock exchange, by  being kept out of other branches of economic activity. Being on the  stock exchange, we are consequently exposed afresh to contempt. At the  same time we continue to produce an abundance of mediocre intellects  who find no outlet, and this endangers our social position as much as  does our increasing wealth. Educated Jews without means are now  rapidly becoming Socialists. Hence we are certain to suffer very  severely in the struggle between classes, because we stand in the most  exposed position in the camps of both Socialists and capitalists.      PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT A SOLUTION    The artificial means heretofore employed to overcome the troubles of  Jews have been either too petty--such as attempts at colonization--or  attempts to convert the Jews into peasants in their present homes.    What is achieved by transporting a few thousand Jews to another  country? Either they come to grief at once, or prosper, and then their  prosperity creates Anti-Semitism. We have already discussed these  attempts to divert poor Jews to fresh districts. This diversion is  clearly inadequate and futile, if it does not actually defeat its own  ends; for it merely protracts and postpones a solution, and perhaps  even aggravates difficulties.    Whoever would attempt to convert the Jew into a husbandman would be  making an extraordinary mistake. For a peasant is in a historical  category, as proved by his costume which in some countries he has worn  for centuries; and by his tools, which are identical with those used  by his earliest forefathers. His plough is unchanged; he carries the  seed in his apron; mows with the historical scythe, and threshes with  the time-honored flail. But we know that all this can be done by  machinery. The agrarian question is only a question of machinery.  America must conquer Europe, in the same way as large landed  possessions absorb small ones. The peasant is consequently a type  which is in course of extinction. Whenever he is artificially  preserved, it is done on account of the political interests which he  is intended to serve. It is absurd, and indeed impossible, to make  modern peasants on the old pattern. No one is wealthy or powerful  enough to make civilization take a single retrograde step. The mere  preservation of obsolete institutions is a task severe enough to  require the enforcement of all the despotic measures of an  autocratically governed State.    Are we, therefore, to credit Jews who are intelligent with a desire to  become peasants of the old type? One might just as well say to them:  \"Here is a cross-bow: now go to war!\" What? With a cross-bow, while  the others have rifles and long range guns? Under these circumstances  the Jews are perfectly justified in refusing to stir when people try  to make peasants of them. A cross-bow is a beautiful weapon, which  inspires me with mournful feelings when I have time to devote to them.  But it belongs by rights to a museum.    Now, there certainly are districts to which desperate Jews go out, or  at any rate, are willing to go out and till the soil. And a little  observation shows that these districts--such as the enclave of Hesse  in Germany, and some provinces in Russia--these very districts are the  principal seats of Anti-Semitism.    For the world's reformers, who send the Jews to the plough, forget a  very important person, who has a great deal to say on the matter. This  person is the agriculturist, and the agriculturist is also perfectly  justified. For the tax on land, the risks attached to crops, the  pressure of large proprietors who cheapen labor, and American  competition in particular, combine to make his life hard enough.  Besides, the duties on corn cannot go on increasing indefinitely. Nor  can the manufacturer be allowed to starve; his political influence is,  in fact, in the ascendant, and he must therefore be treated with  additional consideration.    All these difficulties are well known, therefore I refer to them only  cursorily. I merely wanted to indicate clearly how futile had been  past attempts--most of them well intentioned--to solve the Jewish  Question. Neither a diversion of the stream, nor an artificial  depression of the intellectual level of our proletariat, will overcome  the difficulty. The supposed infallible expedient of assimilation has  already been dealt with.    We cannot get the better of Anti-Semitism by any of these methods. It  cannot die out so long as its causes are not removed. Are they  removable?      CAUSES OF ANTI-SEMITISM    We shall not again touch on those causes which are a result of  temperament, prejudice and narrow views, but shall here restrict  ourselves to political and economical causes alone. Modern  Anti-Semitism is not to be confounded with the religious persecution  of the Jews of former times. It does occasionally take a religious  bias in some countries, but the main current of the aggressive  movement has now changed. In the principal countries where  Anti-Semitism prevails, it does so as a result of the emancipation of  the Jews. When civilized nations awoke to the inhumanity of  discriminatory legislation and enfranchised us, our enfranchisement  came too late. It was no longer possible to remove our disabilities in  our old homes. For we had, curiously enough, developed while in the  Ghetto into a bourgeois people, and we stepped out of it only to enter  into fierce competition with the middle classes. Hence, our  emancipation set us suddenly within this middle-class circle, where we  have a double pressure to sustain, from within and from without. The  Christian bourgeoisie would not be unwilling to cast us as a sacrifice  to Socialism, though that would not greatly improve matters.    At the same time, the equal rights of Jews before the law cannot be  withdrawn where they have once been conceded. Not only because their  withdrawal would be opposed to the spirit of our age, but also because  it would immediately drive all Jews, rich and poor alike, into the  ranks of subversive "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#14)"],[1," whether the cat's behaviour is due to some  mental fact called \"knowledge,\" or displays a merely bodily habit. Our  habitual knowledge is not always in our minds, but is called up by the  appropriate stimuli. If we are asked \"What is the capital of France?\"  we answer \"Paris,\" because of past experience; the past experience is as  essential as the present question in the causation of our response. Thus  all our habitual knowledge consists of acquired habits, and comes under  the head of mnemic phenomena.    (b) IMAGES.--I shall have much to say about images in a later lecture;  for the present I am merely concerned with them in so far as they are  \"copies\" of past sensations. When you hear New York spoken of, some  image probably comes into your mind, either of the place itself (if you  have been there), or of some picture of it (if you have not). The image  is due to your past experience, as well as to the present stimulus of  the words \"New York.\" Similarly, the images you have in dreams are  all dependent upon your past experience, as well as upon the present  stimulus to dreaming. It is generally believed that all images, in their  simpler parts, are copies of sensations; if so, their mnemic character  is evident. This is important, not only on its own account, but also  because, as we shall see later, images play an essential part in what is  called \"thinking.\"    (c) ASSOCIATION.--The broad fact of association, on the mental side, is  that when we experience something which we have experienced before,  it tends to call up the context of the former experience. The smell of  peat-smoke recalling a former scene is an instance which we discussed a  moment ago. This is obviously a mnemic phenomenon. There is also a more  purely physical association, which is indistinguishable from physical  habit. This is the kind studied by Mr. Thorndike in animals, where a  certain stimulus is associated with a certain act. This is the sort  which is taught to soldiers in drilling, for example. In such a case  there need not be anything mental, but merely a habit of the body.  There is no essential distinction between association and habit, and the  observations which we made concerning habit as a mnemic phenomenon are  equally applicable to association.    (d) NON-SENSATIONAL ELEMENTS IN PERCEPTION.--When we perceive any object  of a familiar kind, much of what appears subjectively to be immediately  given is really derived from past experience. When we see an object, say  a penny, we seem to be aware of its \"real\" shape we have the impression  of something circular, not of something elliptical. In learning to draw,  it is necessary to acquire the art of representing things according  to the sensation, not according to the perception. And the visual  appearance is filled out with feeling of what the object would be like  to touch, and so on. This filling out and supplying of the \"real\" shape  and so on consists of the most usual correlates of the sensational core  in our perception. It may happen that, in the particular case, the real  correlates are unusual; for example, if what we are seeing is a  carpet made to look like tiles. If so, the non-sensational part of our  perception will be illusory, i.e. it will supply qualities which the  object in question does not in fact have. But as a rule objects do  have the qualities added by perception, which is to be expected,  since experience of what is usual is the cause of the addition. If our  experience had been different, we should not fill out sensation in  the same way, except in so far as the filling out is instinctive,  not acquired. It would seem that, in man, all that makes up space  perception, including the correlation of sight and touch and so on, is  almost entirely acquired. In that case there is a large mnemic element  in all the common perceptions by means of which we handle common  objects. And, to take another kind of instance, imagine what our  astonishment would be if we were to hear a cat bark or a dog mew. This  emotion would be dependent upon past experience, and would therefore be  a mnemic phenomenon according to the definition.    (e) MEMORY AS KNOWLEDGE.--The kind of memory of which I am now speaking  is definite knowledge of some past event in one's own experience.  From time to time we remember things that have happened to us, because  something in the present reminds us of them. Exactly the same present  fact would not call up the same memory if our past experience had been  different. Thus our remembering is caused by--    (1) The present stimulus,    (2) The past occurrence.    It is therefore a mnemic phenomenon according to our definition. A  definition of \"mnemic phenomena\" which did not include memory would,  of course, be a bad one. The point of the definition is not that it  includes memory, but that it includes it as one of a class of phenomena  which embrace all that is characteristic in the subject matter of  psychology.    (f) EXPERIENCE.--The word \"experience\" is often used very vaguely.  James, as we saw, uses it to cover the whole primal stuff of the world,  but this usage seems objection able, since, in a purely physical world,  things would happen without there being any experience. It is only  mnemic phenomena that embody experience. We may say that an animal  \"experiences\" an occurrence when this occurrence modifies the animal's  subsequent behaviour, i.e. when it is the mnemic portion of the cause of  future occurrences in the animal's life. The burnt child that fears the  fire has \"experienced\" the fire, whereas a stick that has been thrown on  and taken off again has not \"experienced\" anything, since it offers  no more resistance than before to being thrown on. The essence of  \"experience\" is the modification of behaviour produced by what is  experienced. We might, in fact, define one chain of experience, or one  biography, as a series of occurrences linked by mnemic causation. I  think it is this characteristic, more than any other, that distinguishes  sciences dealing with living organisms from physics.    The best writer on mnemic phenomena known to me is Richard Semon, the  fundamental part of whose theory I shall endeavour to summarize before  going further:    When an organism, either animal or plant, is subjected to a stimulus,  producing in it some state of excitement, the removal of the stimulus  allows it to return to a condition of equilibrium. But the new state  of equilibrium is different from the old, as may be seen by the changed  capacity for reaction. The state of equilibrium before the stimulus may  be called the \"primary indifference-state\"; that after the cessation  of the stimulus, the \"secondary indifference-state.\" We define the  \"engraphic effect\" of a stimulus as the effect in making a difference  between the primary and secondary indifference-states, and this  difference itself we define as the \"engram\" due to the stimulus. \"Mnemic  phenomena\" are defined as those due to engrams; in animals, they are  specially associated with the nervous system, but not exclusively, even  in man.    When two stimuli occur together, one of them, occurring afterwards,  may call out the reaction for the other also. We call this an \"ekphoric  influence,\" and stimuli having this character are called \"ekphoric  stimuli.\" In such a case we call the engrams of the two stimuli  \"associated.\" All simultaneously generated engrams are associated; there  is also association of successively aroused engrams, though this is  reducible to simultaneous association. In fact, it is not an isolated  stimulus that leaves an engram, but the totality of the stimuli at any  moment; consequently any portion of this totality tends, if it recurs,  to arouse the whole reaction which was aroused before. Semon holds that  engrams can be inherited, and that an animal's innate habits may be due  to the experience of its ancestors; on this subject he refers to Samuel  Butler.    Semon formulates two \"mnemic principles.\" The first, or \"Law of  Engraphy,\" is as follows: \"All simultaneous excitements in an organism  form a connected simultaneous excitement-complex, which as such works  engraphically, i.e. leaves behind a connected engram-complex, which  in so far forms a whole\" (\"Die mnemischen Empfindungen,\" p. 146).  The second mnemic principle, or \"Law of Ekphory,\" is as follows:  \"The partial return of the energetic situation which formerly worked  engraphically operates ekphorically on a simultaneous engram-complex\"  (ib., p. 173). These two laws together represent in part a hypothesis  (the engram), and in part an observable fact. The observable fact is  that, when a certain complex of stimuli has originally caused a certain  complex of reactions, the recurrence of part of the stimuli tends to  cause the recurrence of the whole of the reactions.    Semon's applications of his fundamental ideas in various directions are  interesting and ingenious. Some of them will concern us later, but for  the present it is the fundamental character of mnemic phenomena that is  in question.    Concerning the nature of an engram, Semon confesses that at present it  is impossible to say more than that it must consist in some material  alteration in the body of the organism (\"Die mnemischen Empfindungen,\"  p. 376). It is, in fact, hypothetical, invoked for theoretical uses, and  not an outcome of direct observation. No doubt physiology, especially  the disturbances of memory through lesions in the brain, affords grounds  for this hypothesis; nevertheless it does remain a hypothesis, the  validity of which will be discussed at the end of this lecture.    I am inclined to think that, in the present state of physiology, the  introduction of the engram does not serve to simplify the account of  mnemic phenomena. We can, I think, formulate the known laws of such  phenomena in terms, wholly, of observable facts, by recognizing  provisionally what we may call \"mnemic"]]]
