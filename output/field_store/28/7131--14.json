Through the pillars of the Shamiana we could see lines of white helmets  of troops, and beyond them the crowds of natives in bright dresses,  banked against the houses and in groups in the trees, a kaleidoscope of  colour. Past this came a whirl of Indian cavalry with glittering sabres,  and the Prince and Princess came on to the dais--more brightly dressed  than they were in Oxford Street three weeks ago, the Prince in a white  naval uniform with a little gold and a white helmet, an uncommonly  becoming dress though so simple; the Princess in the palest pink with a  suggestion of darker pink showing through, and a deep rose between hat  and hair. A tubby native in frock coat and brown face and little pink  turban held a mushroom golden umbrella near the Prince and Princess, not  over them, it really was not needed for there were clouds, and the light  was just pleasant. The Prince then \"laid\" the stone--that is, some  natives slackened the tackle, and it came down all square--and he and  the Princess talked to the Personages in attendance and various City  Dignitaries. First, I should have said, the Prince read a speech which  seemed to me to cover the ground admirably. I forget what he said now,  but you could hear every word. He had notes, but I think he spoke by  heart. I made a careful picture of it all; red decorations, green grass,  Prince and Princess, and the golden umbrella, but it is gone, lost--gone  where pins go, I suppose.    You should have heard the people cheering, and seen the running to and  fro of crowds to catch a glimpse of the great Raj as he drove away! In a  minute the great place was all on the move, Rajahs getting into their  carriages and dashing off with their guards riding before and behind,  and smaller Rajahs with seedier carriages and only bare-footed footmen  jumping up behind.    Everyone was happy and interested, and what a bustle and movement there  was! The banging of the guns on the men-of-war began again as the  motley, fascinatingly interesting crowd, cavalry outriders, Sikhs,  Parsees, Gourkas, Hindoos, and Mussulmen, sped away down to the Apollo  Bundar to see the Prince go off to the flagship. H. and I went with the  tide, a jolly cheery medley of coloured races, waddling, trotting,  running, the whole crowd cut in two by the Royal Scots marching through  them, their pipers playing the \"Glendaruil Highlanders.\" Sandies and  Donalds and natives of India, but all subjects of the great Raj: and all  got down together to the Bundar to see the Royal embarkation. Next we  met G. and Mrs H. driving as fast as possible through the crowd to still  another function, at the Town Hall, where the British Princess met the  women of all India in their splendour, and woman's world met woman's  world for the world's good. I'd fain have seen the tall, fair, Saxon  surrounded by devoted Eastern subjects! All I did see was some of the  preparations--red cloth being laid in acres up to a stately  Parthenon--but from various accounts I have heard from ladies who were  present, this must have been one of the most extraordinary and gorgeous  functions the world has ever seen.    The Princess, in robes and creations that chilled words, walked  ankle-deep in white flower petals and golden clippings, pearls rained,  and on all sides were grouped the most beautiful Eastern ladies in most  exquisite silks of every tint of the rainbow, with diamonds, pearls, and  emeralds and trailing draperies, skirts, and soft veils, and silken  trousers; sweet scents and sounds there were too, in this Oriental dream  of heaven, and everything showed to the utmost advantage in the mellow  trembling light that fell from two thousand five hundred candles, and  one hundred and ninety-nine glittering and bejewelled candelabra. And in  the middle, there was a golden throne of bejewelled peacocks, and  punkahs and umbrellas of gold and rose--a dream of beauty--and not one  man in the whole show!    The Apollo Bundar, as everyone who has been in India knows, is a  projecting part of the esplanade below the Taj Hotel. Here Royalties are  in the habit of landing and embarking. On the centre has been built  something in the nature of a triumphal arch with eastern arches and  minarets at its four corners with golden domes. It is all white, and  between it and the pavilion at the landing stairs a great awning, or  Shamiana is stretched, of broad red and white striped cloth. Everywhere  are waving flags from golden spears, and little palms and shrubs in  green tubs are arranged on either side of the Shamiana; and the effect  is quite pretty; but considering the historic importance of the occasion  and the natural suitability of the surroundings for a Royal landing, the  conception and arrangement of spectacular effect was astoundingly  poor--and it must be admitted it is a mistake to hide the principal  actors at the most telling point of a momentous event with bunting and  shrubs in pots, or both! The actual landing, the stepping on shore,  should have been pictorial and visible to the thousands of spectators.  Instead of this, the Royal personages, the moment they stepped ashore,  were conducted into this tent, to listen to written speeches! What an  occasion for a great spectacular effect lost for ever!    When we got down to the Bundar the Sikh cavalry had dismounted and stood  at their horses' heads; their dark blue and dark rose uniforms and  turbans made a foil to the brilliant dresses of the crowd.    After witnessing the departure of the Prince, we sat a breathing space  on the lawn at the Yacht Club and watched the day fading, \"Evening  falling, shadows rising,\" and the ladies dresses growing faint in  colour, as the background of the Bay and the white men-of-war became  less distinct; the golden evening light crept up the lateen sails in  front of us and left them all grey, and the moon rose beyond the Bay,  and the club lamps were lit, and the guns began to play--vivid flashes  of flame; and a roar round the fleet, straight in our faces, and again  far over to Elephanta, yellow flashes in the violet twilight, and the  Prince came ashore.    The cavalry and their lances at once follow his carriage; they are  silhouetted against the last of gold in the west, flicker across the  lamps of the Bundar, and rattle away into the shadows of the streets.  There is the noise of many horses feet and harness, and the last of the  guns from the fleet. Then the night is quiet again and hot as ever, and  there's nothing left of the glare and noise of the day, only the glowing  lamps on some of the buildings, and the subdued hum of the talk of the  moving thousands, and the whispering sound of their bare feet in the  dust. The Eastern crowd is distinctly impressed and very much  compressed; they will now spend the rest of the evening gazing at the  Bombay public buildings that are being lit all over with little oil  lamps.    And this was but a small part of the day for us, the best was to come in  the damp, hot night.          CHAPTER IX      [Illustration: (With apologies to the Indian Surveys.)]    Dined at our hostlerie; in every direction vistas of uniforms, ladies'  dresses, maharajahs, rajahs, turbans, and jewels, the marble pillars and  the arches of blue night over the bay for background.    Then we got away in a bustle of hundreds of other carriages and  gharries, all bound for Government House. We started a little late; you  may have observed that with ladies you are apt to be late for social  functions, but rarely miss a train! H. and I drove ahead with soothing  cigars, and the ladies came close behind.    On our left we passed the R.H. Artillery Camp, rows of tents frosted  with moonlight against the southern sea, some had lamps glowing inside;  and further on we passed their lines of picketted horses, with silent  native syces squatted on the sand at their feet.    ... The dust hangs heavily from the gharries in front of us as we drive  north round the Back Bay, which we are told is very beautiful, and like  the Bay of Naples in the daytime; what we see on this warm night is a  smooth, dark sea, which gives an infrequent soft surge on the shore, a  few boats lie up on the moonlit sand and figures lie asleep in their  shadows, and others sit round little fires. Dark palm stems and banyan  trees are between us and the sea, and to our right are fern-clad rocks  and trees in night green shade, rising steeply to where we can  distinguish white walls and lights of villas of the wealthy Bombay  natives.    We pass the Parsis' Towers of Silence, where vultures entomb the dead,  and inhale for a long part of the road the smoke of burning wood and  Hindoos--an outrageous experience. The road rises gradually and gets  narrower as we leave the shore, and the procession of carriages goes  slower. On either side are low white walls and villas and heavy foliage.  Coloured lamps are hung in every direction, and their mellow lights  blend pleasantly with the moonlight and shadows, and shine through the  flags that hang without movement, and light up ropes of flowers and  ribands with gold inscriptions of welcome, that stretch from tree to  tree across the road. You read on them in golden letters, \"Tell papa how  happy we are under British Rule,\" and on the walls, sitting or lying at  length, and in the trees are bronze-coloured natives in white clothes,  or in the buff, silently watching the procession of carriages, and they  do look as contented as can be; and so would we be too, if we had to get  into their evening undress instead of hard shirts and broad cloth on  such a damp, hot night. It is November and ought to be cool, but this  year everyone says it is just October as regards temperature and  moisture, and October, they say, is"]]]
