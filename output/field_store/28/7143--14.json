Before I left Jamaica for Navy Bay, as narrated in the last chapter,  war had been declared against Russia, and we were all anxiously  expecting news of a descent upon the Crimea. Now, no sooner had I  heard of war somewhere, than I longed to witness it; and when I was  told that many of the regiments I had known so well in Jamaica had  left England for the scene of action, the desire to join them became  stronger than ever. I used to stand for hours in silent thought before  an old map of the world, in a little corner of which some one had  chalked a red cross, to enable me to distinguish where the Crimea was;  and as I traced the route thither, all difficulties would vanish. But  when I came to talk over the project with my friends, the best scheme  I could devise seemed so wild and improbable, that I was fain to  resign my hopes for a time, and so started for Navy Bay.    But all the way to England, from Navy Bay, I was turning my old wish  over and over in my mind; and when I found myself in London, in the  autumn of 1854, just after the battle of Alma had been fought, and my  old friends were fairly before the walls of Sebastopol, how to join  them there took up far more of my thoughts than that visionary  gold-mining speculation on the river Palmilla, which seemed so  feasible to us in New Granada, but was considered so wild and  unprofitable a speculation in London. And, as time wore on, the  inclination to join my old friends of the 97th, 48th, and other  regiments, battling with worse foes than yellow fever or cholera, took  such exclusive possession of my mind, that I threw over the gold  speculation altogether, and devoted all my energies to my new scheme.    Heaven knows it was visionary enough! I had no friends who could help  me in such a project--nay, who would understand why I desired to go,  and what I desired to do when I got there. My funds, although they  might, carefully husbanded, carry me over the three thousand miles,  and land me at Balaclava, would not support me there long; while to  persuade the public that an unknown Creole woman would be useful to  their army before Sebastopol was too improbable an achievement to be  thought of for an instant. Circumstances, however, assisted me.    As the winter wore on, came hints from various quarters of  mismanagement, want, and suffering in the Crimea; and after the  battles of Balaclava and Inkermann, and the fearful storm of the 14th  of November, the worst anticipations were realized. Then we knew that  the hospitals were full to suffocation, that scarcity and exposure  were the fate of all in the camp, and that the brave fellows for whom  any of us at home would have split our last shilling, and shared our  last meal, were dying thousands of miles away from the active sympathy  of their fellow-countrymen. Fast and thick upon the news of Inkermann,  fought by a handful of fasting and enfeebled men against eight times  their number of picked Russians, brought fresh and animated to the  contest, and while all England was reeling beneath the shock of that  fearful victory, came the sad news that hundreds were dying whom the  Russian shot and sword had spared, and that the hospitals of Scutari  were utterly unable to shelter, or their inadequate staff to attend  to, the ship-loads of sick and wounded which were sent to them across  the stormy Black Sea.    But directly England knew the worst, she set about repairing her past  neglect. In every household busy fingers were working for the poor  soldier--money flowed in golden streams wherever need was--and  Christian ladies, mindful of the sublime example, \"I was sick, and ye  visited me,\" hastened to volunteer their services by those sick-beds  which only women know how to soothe and bless.    Need I be ashamed to confess that I shared in the general enthusiasm,  and longed more than ever to carry my busy (and the reader will not  hesitate to add experienced) fingers where the sword or bullet had  been busiest, and pestilence most rife. I had seen much of sorrow and  death elsewhere, but they had never daunted me; and if I could feel  happy binding up the wounds of quarrelsome Americans and treacherous  Spaniards, what delight should I not experience if I could be useful  to my own \"sons,\" suffering for a cause it was so glorious to fight  and bleed for! I never stayed to discuss probabilities, or enter into  conjectures as to my chances of reaching the scene of action. I made  up my mind that if the army wanted nurses, they would be glad of me,  and with all the ardour of my nature, which ever carried me where  inclination prompted, I decided that I _would_ go to the Crimea; and  go I did, as all the world knows.    Of course, had it not been for my old strong-mindedness (which has  nothing to do with obstinacy, and is in no way related to it--the best  term I can think of to express it being \"judicious decisiveness\"), I  should have given up the scheme a score of times in as many days; so  regularly did each successive day give birth to a fresh set of rebuffs  and disappointments. I shall make no excuse to my readers for giving  them a pretty full history of my struggles to become a Crimean  _heroine_!    My first idea (and knowing that I was well fitted for the work, and  would be the right woman in the right place, the reader can fancy my  audacity) was to apply to the War Office for the post of hospital  nurse. Among the diseases which I understood were most prevalent in  the Crimea were cholera, diarrhoea, and dysentery, all of them more  or less known in tropical climates; and with which, as the reader will  remember, my Panama experience had made me tolerably familiar. Now, no  one will accuse me of presumption, if I say that I thought (and so it  afterwards proved) that my knowledge of these human ills would not  only render my services as a nurse more valuable, but would enable me  to be of use to the overworked doctors. That others thought so too, I  took with me ample testimony. I cannot resist the temptation of  giving my readers one of the testimonials I had, it seems so eminently  practical and to the point:--        \"I became acquainted with Mrs. Seacole through the      instrumentality of T. B. Cowan, Esq., H. B. M. Consul at      Colon, on the Isthmus of Panama, and have had many      opportunities of witnessing her professional zeal and      ability in the treatment of aggravated forms of tropical      diseases.        \"I am myself personally much indebted for her      indefatigable kindness and skill at a time when I am apt      to believe the advice of a practitioner qualified in the      North would have little availed.        \"Her peculiar fitness, in a constitutional point of      view, for the duties of a medical attendant, needs no      comment.            (Signed) \"A. G. M.,                \"Late Medical Officer, West Granada                  Gold-mining Company.\"    So I made long and unwearied application at the War Office, in  blissful ignorance of the labour and time I was throwing away. I have  reason to believe that I considerably interfered with the repose of  sundry messengers, and disturbed, to an alarming degree, the official  gravity of some nice gentlemanly young fellows, who were working out  their salaries in an easy, off-hand way. But my ridiculous endeavours  to gain an interview with the Secretary-at-War of course failed, and  glad at last to oblige a distracted messenger, I transferred my  attentions to the Quartermaster-General's department. Here I saw  another gentleman, who listened to me with a great deal of polite  enjoyment, and--his amusement ended--hinted, had I not better apply  to the Medical Department; and accordingly I attached myself to their  quarters with the same unwearying ardour. But, of course, I grew tired  at last, and then I changed my plans.    Now, I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who  would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the  Crimea and nurse her \"sons\" there, suffering from cholera,  diarrhoea, and a host of lesser ills. In my country, where people  know our use, it would have been different; but here it was natural  enough--although I had references, and other voices spoke for me--that  they should laugh, good-naturedly enough, at my offer. War, I know, is  a serious game, but sometimes very humble actors are of great use in  it, and if the reader, when he comes in time to peruse the evidence of  those who had to do with the Sebastopol drama, of my share in it, will  turn back to this chapter, he will confess perhaps that, after all,  the impulse which led me to the War Department was not unnatural.    My new scheme was, I candidly confess, worse devised than the one  which had failed. Miss Nightingale had left England for the Crimea,  but other nurses were still to follow, and my new plan was simply to  offer myself to Mrs. H---- as a recruit. Feeling that I was one of the  very women they most wanted, experienced and fond of the work, I  jumped at once to the conclusion that they would gladly enrol me in  their number. To go to Cox's, the army agents, who were most obliging  to me, and obtain the Secretary-at-War's private address, did not take  long; and that done, I laid the same pertinacious siege to his great  house in ---- Square, as I had previously done to his place of  business.    Many a long hour did I wait in his great hall, while scores passed in  and out; many of them looking curiously at me. The flunkeys, noble  creatures! marvelled exceedingly at the yellow woman whom no excuses  could get rid of, nor impertinence dismay, and showed me very clearly  that they resented my persisting in remaining there in mute appeal  from their sovereign will. At last I gave that up, after a message  from Mrs. H. that the full complement of nurses had been secured, and  that my offer could not be entertained. Once again I tried, and had an  interview"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#14)"],[1,"parallel between Corneille  and Racine:--         Corneille subjects us to his characters and to his ideas; Racine       accommodates himself to ours. The one paints men as they ought to       be; the other paints them as they are. There is more in the former       of what one admires, and of what one ought even to imitate; there       is more in the latter of what one observes in others, or of what       one experiences in one's self. The one inspires, astonishes,       masters, instructs; the other pleases, moves, touches, penetrates.       Whatever there is most beautiful, most noble, most imperial, in the       reason is made use of by the former; by the latter, whatever is       most seductive and most delicate in passion. You find in the       former, maxims, rules, and precepts; in the latter, taste and       sentiment. You are more absorbed in the plays of Corneille; you are       more shaken and more softened in those of Racine. Corneille is more       moral; Racine, more natural. The one appears to make Sophocles his       model; the other owes more to Euripides.    * * *    Less than half a century after La Rochefoucauld and La Bruyere had shown  the way, Vauvenargues followed in a similar style of authorship,  promising almost to rival the fame of his two predecessors. This writer,  during his brief life (he died at thirty-two), produced one not  inconsiderable literary work more integral and regular in form,  entitled, \"Introduction to the Knowledge of the Human Mind\"; but it is  his disconnected thoughts and observations chiefly that continue to  preserve his name.    Luc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues, though nobly born, was poor.  His health was frail. He did not receive a good education in his youth.  Indeed, he was still in his youth when he went to the wars. His culture  always remained narrow. He did not know Greek and Latin, when to know  Greek and Latin was, as it were, the whole of scholarship. To crown his  accidental disqualifications for literary work, he fell a victim to the  small-pox, which left him wrecked in body. This occurred almost  immediately after he abandoned a military career which had been fruitful  to him of hardship, but not of promotion. In spite of all that was thus  against him, Vauvenargues, in those years, few and evil, that were his,  thought finely and justly enough to earn for himself a lasting place in  the literary history of his nation. He was in the eighteenth century of  France, without being of it. You have to separate him in thought from  the infidels and the \"philosophers\" of his time. He belongs in spirit to  an earlier age. His moral and intellectual kindred was with such as  Pascal, far more than with such as Voltaire. Vauvenargues is, however, a  writer for the few, instead of for the many. His fame is high, but it is  not wide. Historically, he forms a stepping-stone of transition to a  somewhat similar nineteenth-century name, that of Joubert. A very few  sentences of his will suffice to indicate to our readers the quality of  Vauvenargues. Self-evidently, the following antithesis drawn by him  between Corneille and Racine is subtly and ingeniously thought, as well  as very happily expressed--this, whatever may be considered to be its  aptness in point of literary appreciation:--         Corneille's heroes often say great things without inspiring them;       Racine's inspire them without saying them.    Here is a good saying:--         It is a great sign of mediocrity always to be moderate in praising.    There is worldly wisdom also here:--         He who knows how to turn his prodigalities to good account,       practises a large and noble economy.    Virgil's \"They are able, because they seem to themselves to be able,\" is  recalled by this:--         The consciousness of our strength makes our strength greater.    So much for Vauvenargues.          VI.    LA FONTAINE.    1621-1695.      La Fontaine enjoys a unique fame. He has absolutely \"no fellow in the  firmament\" of literature. He is the only fabulist, of any age or any  nation, that, on the score simply of his fables, is admitted to be poet  as well as fabulist. There is perhaps no other literary name whatever  among the French, by long proof more secure, than is La Fontaine's, of  universal and of immortal renown. Such a fame is, of course, not the  most resplendent in the world; but to have been the first, and to remain  thus far the only, writer of fables enjoying recognition as true  poetry,--this surely is an achievement entitling La Fontaine to  monumental mention in any sketch, however summary, of French literature.    Jean de La Fontaine was humbly born, at Chateau-Thierry in Champagne.  His early education was sadly neglected. At twenty years of age he was  still phenomenally ignorant. About this time, being now better situated,  he developed a taste for the classics and for poetry. With La Fontaine  the man, it is the sadly familiar French story of debauched manners in  life and in literary production. We cannot acquit him, but we are to  condemn him only in common with the most of his age and of his nation.  As the world goes, La Fontaine was a \"good fellow,\" never lacking  friends. These were held fast in loyalty to the poet, not so much by any  sterling worth of character felt in him, as by an exhaustless,  easy-going good-nature, that, despite his social insipidity, made La  Fontaine the most acceptable of every-day companions. It would be easy  to repeat many stories illustrative of this personal quality in La  Fontaine, while to tell a single story illustrative of any lofty trait  in his character would he perhaps impossible. Still, La Fontaine seemed  not ungrateful for the benefits he received from others; and gratitude,  no commonplace virtue, let us accordingly reckon to the credit of a man  in general so slenderly equipped with positive claims to admiring  personal regard. The mirror of _bonhomie_ (easy-hearted  good-fellowship), he always was. Indeed, that significant, almost  untranslatable, French word might have been coined to fit La Fontaine's  case. On his amiable side--a full hemisphere or more of the man--it sums  him up completely. Twenty years long, this mirror of _bonhomie_ was  domiciliated, like a pet animal, under the hospitable roof of the  celebrated Madame de la Sabliere. There was truth as well as humor  implied in what she said one day: \"I have sent away all my domestics; I  have kept only my dog, my cat, and La Fontaine.\"    But La Fontaine had that in him which kept the friendship of serious  men. Moliere, a grave, even melancholy spirit, however gay in his  comedies; Boileau and Racine, decorous both of them, at least in  manners,--constituted, together with La Fontaine, a kind of private  \"Academy,\" existing on a diminutive scale, which was not without its  important influence on French letters. La Fontaine seems to have been a  sort of Goldsmith in this club of wits, the butt of many pleasantries  from his colleagues, called out by his habit of absent-mindedness. St.  Augustine was one night the subject of an elaborate eulogy, which La  Fontaine lost the benefit of, through a reverie of his own indulged  meantime on a quite different character. Catching, however, at the name,  La Fontaine, as he came to himself for a moment, betrayed the secret of  his absent thoughts by asking, \"Do you think St. Augustine had as much  wit as Rabelais?\"--\"Take care, Monsieur La Fontaine: you have put one of  your stockings on wrong side out,\"--he had actually done so,--was the  only answer vouchsafed to his question. The speaker in this case was a  doctor of the Sorbonne (brother to Boileau), present as guest. The story  is told of La Fontaine, that egged on to groundless jealousy of his  wife,--a wife whom he never really loved, and whom he soon would finally  abandon,--he challenged a military friend of his to combat with swords.  The friend was amazed, and, amazed, reluctantly fought with La Fontaine,  whom he easily put at his mercy. \"Now, what is this for?\" he demanded.  \"The public says you visit my house for my wife's sake, not for mine,\"  said La Fontaine. \"Then I never will come again.\" \"Far from it,\"  responds La Fontaine, seizing his friend's hand. \"I have satisfied the  public. Now you must come to my house every day, or I will fight you  again.\" The two went back in company, and breakfasted together in mutual  good humor.    A trait or two more, and there will have been enough of the man La  Fontaine. It is said that when, on the death of Madame de la Sabliere,  La Fontaine was homeless, he was met on the street by a friend, who  exclaimed, \"I was looking for you; come to my house, and live with me!\"  \"I was on the way there,\" La Fontaine characteristically replied. At  seventy, La Fontaine went through a process of \"conversion,\" so called,  in which he professed repentance of his sins. On the genuineness of this  inward experience of La Fontaine, it is not for a fellow-creature of  his, especially at this distance of time, to pronounce. When he died,  at seventy-three, Fenelon could say of him (in Latin), \"La Fontaine is  no more! He is no more; and with him have gone the playful jokes, the  merry laugh, the artless graces, and the sweet Muses!\"    La Fontaine's earliest works were _Contes_, so styled; that is, stories,  tales, or romances. These are in character such that the subsequent  happy change in manners, if not in morals, has made them  unreadable,--for their indecency. We need concern ourselves only with  the Fables, for it is on these that La Fontaine's fame securely rests.  The basis of story in them was not generally original with La Fontaine.  He took whatever fittest came to his hand. With much modesty, he  attributed all to AEsop and Phaedrus. But invention of his own is not  altogether wanting to his books of fables. Still, it is chiefly the  consummate artful artlessness of the form that constitutes the  individual merit "]]]
