These unhappy members of a  class, to one of which the tenderest words that Jesus ever spake were  uttered, left in a few weeks, absolutely driven away by public opinion.  The disappointed gamblers sold the house to its present proprietor for  a few hundred dollars.    Mr. B., the landlord of the Empire, was a Western farmer who with his  wife crossed the plains about two years ago. Immediately on his arrival  he settled at a mining station, where he remained until last spring,  when he removed to Rich Bar. Mrs. B. is a gentle and amiable looking  woman, about twenty-five years of age. She is an example of the  terrible wear and tear to the complexion in crossing the plains, hers  having become, through exposure at that time, of a dark and permanent  yellow, anything but becoming. I will give you a key to her character,  which will exhibit it better than weeks of description. She took a  nursing babe, eight months old, from her bosom, and left it with two  other children, almost infants, to cross the plains in search of gold!  When I arrived she was cooking supper for some half a dozen people,  while her really pretty boy, who lay kicking furiously in his  champagne-basket cradle, and screaming with a six-months-old-baby  power, had, that day, completed just two weeks of his earthly  pilgrimage. The inconvenience which she suffered during what George  Sand calls \"the sublime martyrdom of maternity\" would appal the wife of  the humblest pauper of a New England village. Another woman, also from  the West, was with her at the time of her infant's birth, but scarcely  had the \"latest-found\" given the first characteristic shriek of its  debut upon the stage of life, when this person herself was taken  seriously ill, and was obliged to return to her own cabin, leaving the  poor exhausted mother entirely alone! Her husband lay seriously sick  himself at the time, and of course could offer her no assistance. A  miner, who lived in the house, and hoarded himself, carried her some  bread and tea in the morning and evening, and that was all the care she  had. Two days after its birth, she made a desperate effort, and, by  easy stages of ten minutes at a time, contrived to get poor baby washed  and dressed, after a fashion. He is an astonishingly large and strong  child, holds his head up like a six-monther, and has but one  failing,--a too evident and officious desire to inform everybody, far  and near, at all hours of the night and day, that his lungs are in a  perfectly sound and healthy condition,--a piece of intelligence which,  though very gratifying, is rather inconvenient if one happens to be  particularly sleepy.    Besides Mrs. B., there are three other women on the Bar. One is called  \"the Indiana girl,\" from the name of her pa's hotel, though it must be  confessed that the sweet name of _girl_ seems sadly incongruous when  applied to such a gigantic piece of humanity. I have a great desire to  see her, which will probably not be gratified, as she leaves in a few  days for the valley. But, at any rate, I can say that I have _heard_  her. The far-off roll of her mighty voice, booming through two closed  doors and a long entry, added greatly to the severe attack of nervous  headache under which I was suffering when she called. This gentle  creature wears the thickest kind of miner's boots, and has the dainty  habit of wiping the dishes on her apron! Last spring she _walked_ to  this place, and packed fifty pounds of flour on her back down that  awful hill, the snow being five feet deep at the time.    Mr. and Mrs. B., who have three pretty children, reside in a log cabin  at the entrance of the village. One of the little girls was in the  barroom to-day, and her sweet and birdlike voice brought tearfully, and  yet joyfully, to my memory \"Tearsoul,\" \"Leilie,\" and \"Lile Katie.\"    Mrs. B., who is as small as \"the Indiana girl\" is large (indeed, I have  been confidently informed that she weighs but sixty-eight pounds),  keeps, with her husband, the \"Miners' Home.\" (Mem.--The lady tends  bar.) _Voila_, my dear, the female population of my new home.

Letter _the_ Third    LIFE _and_ FORTUNE _at the_ BAR-DIGGINGS    RICH BAR, EAST BRANCH _of the_ NORTH FORK _of_ FEATHER RIVER,    _September_ 20, 1851.      I intend, to-day, dear M., to be as disagreeably statistical and as  praiseworthily matter-of-factish as the most dogged utilitarian could  desire. I shall give you a full, true, and particular account of the  discovery, rise, and progress of this place, with a religious adherence  to _dates_ which will rather astonish your unmathematical mind. But let  me first describe the spot as it looked to my wondering and  unaccustomed eyes. Remember, I had never seen a mining district before,  and had just left San Francisco, amid whose flashy-looking shops and  showy houses the most of my time had been spent since my arrival in the  Golden State. Of course, to me, the _coup d'oeil_ of Rich Bar was  charmingly fresh and original. Imagine a tiny valley about eight  hundred yards in length, and perhaps thirty in width, (it was measured  for my especial information,) apparently hemmed in by lofty hills,  almost perpendicular, draperied to their very summits with beautiful  fir-trees, the blue-bosomed Plumas (or Feather River, I suppose I must  call it) undulating along their base,--and you have as good an idea as  I can give you of the _local_ of Barra Rica, as the Spaniards so  prettily term it.    In almost any of the numerous books written upon California, no doubt  you will be able to find a most scientific description of the origin of  these bars. I must acknowledge with shame that my ideas on the subject  are distressingly vague. I could never appreciate the poetry or the  humor of making one's wrists ache by knocking to pieces gloomy-looking  stones, or in dirtying one's fingers by analyzing soils, in a vain  attempt to fathom the osteology or anatomy of our beloved earth, though  my heart is thrillingly alive to the faintest shade of color and the  infinite variety of styles in which she delights to robe her  ever-changeful and ever-beautiful _surface_. In my unscientific mind,  the _formations_ are without form, and void; and you might as well talk  Chinese to me, as to embroider your conversation with the terms  \"hornblende,\" \"mica,\" \"limestone,\" \"slate,\" \"granite,\" and \"quartz\" in  a hopeless attempt to enlighten me as to their merits. The dutiful  diligence with which I attended course after course of lectures on  geology, by America's greatest illustrator of that subject, arose  rather from my affectionate reverence for our beloved Dr. H., and the  fascinating charm which his glorious mind throws round every subject  which it condescends to illuminate, than to any interest in the dry  science itself. It is therefore with a most humiliating consciousness  of my geological deficiencies that I offer you the only explanation  which I have been able to obtain from those most learned in such  matters here. I gather from their remarks, that these bars are formed  by deposits of earth rolling down from the mountains, crowding the  river aside and occupying a portion of its deserted bed. If my  definition is unsatisfactory, I can but refer you to some of the  aforesaid works upon California.    Through the middle of Rich Bar runs the street, thickly planted with  about forty tenements, among which figure round tents, square tents,  plank hovels, log cabins, etc., the residences varying in elegance and  convenience from the palatial splendor of \"The Empire\" down to a \"local  habitation\" formed of pine boughs and covered with old calico shirts.    To-day I visited the \"office,\" the only one on the river. I had heard  so much about it from others, as well as from F., that I really _did_  expect something extra. When I entered this imposing place the shock to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#14)"],[1,"would desist. But then, as the dudish young man continued to  gaze at the girl, trying his best to catch her eye, he whispered  something to Fred, and then rose to his feet.    \"All right, Jack, I'm with you if you want any help,\" returned Fred  promptly.    Without hesitation, Jack approached the table at which Brown and  Martell sat eating their soup, and placed himself close to the  latter's side.    \"Now listen to me, Nappy Martell,\" he said in a low but distinct  voice, meant only for the dudish youth. \"You keep your eyes to  yourself and leave my sister and my cousin alone. If you don't, I'll  smash you one in the face that will put you in the hospital. Now  remember--I won't give you another warning!\" And having thus spoken,  Jack turned on his heel and went back to his own table.    Nappy Martell flushed up and an angry retort arose to his lips. Then,  however, he became pale and not a word escaped him.    \"What was that he said, Nappy?\" demanded Slugger in a whisper.    \"I--I'll tell you afterwards,\" stammered Martell. \"He's mighty  fresh--that fellow!\"    \"Did he threaten you?\"    \"I guess he wants to start a row,\" grumbled Nappy. \"But I don't want  any fight in front of those girls.\"    \"Those Rovers are getting too fresh to live,\" was Slugger's comment.  \"Some day we'll have to get after 'em and polish 'em off.\"    \"We can't get after 'em any too quick to suit me,\" answered his crony.    After that Nappy confined his gaze to his chum and to the lunch set  before him. Never once did he allow his eyes to rove over to the table  opposite. Jack had spoken with an intensity that showed his  earnestness, and for once Nappy Martell was completely subdued.    \"Those Rovers are getting to be a regular bunch of rough-necks,\" he  growled, after he and his crony had finished a somewhat hurried meal  and gone back to the smoking car.    \"Did he want to fight you?\" queried Slugger.    \"That's what he had in mind to do--as if I would want to fight before  that crowd of people! Why, we would all have been arrested!\"    Jack's meal had been spoiled for him, but he did not let the others  know this. He, however, kept his eyes on Brown and Martell until they  left the dining car. Then he breathed a sigh of relief.    \"Gee! I'm glad they're gone,\" was Fred's comment.    \"You're no more glad than I am,\" answered his cousin. \"I'll teach him  to stare at my sister! For two pins I'd have wiped up the floor with  him!\"    \"I wish I'd have gotten the chance,\" put in Andy, from across the  aisle. \"Wouldn't I like to have peppered up their food good for them!\"    In due course of time the young Rovers reached the Grand Central  Terminal at Forty-Second Street, in New York City. They had sent a  telegram, announcing their coming, and found Mrs. Dick Rover and Mrs.  Sam Rover awaiting them, each with a touring car.    \"Well, I see you got in on time,\" said Mrs. Dick Rover, after the  greetings were over. \"I thought on account of so many soldiers being  sent to the various camps, the train might be late.\"    \"We saw some soldiers on the way,\" answered her daughter.    \"And we also saw some freight cars carrying cannon,\" put in Mary.    \"This war is going to make a great change all around,\" declared Mrs.  Sam Rover. And then she added to her daughter: \"What do you think  about your father going to the front?\"    \"It's just what I expected,\" answered Mary promptly. \"He's a real  patriot--dad is!\"    \"You are right. But I hate awfully to see him go away,\" sighed the  mother.    The young folks were soon seated in the two automobiles, and their  handbags were disposed of in the tonneau. Then the cars were started  up, and they were soon whirling away over to Broadway and Riverside  Drive, and then to the comfortable mansions occupied by the three  Rover families.    It was still rather early in the afternoon, but Sam Rover had already  come uptown from his office and was there to greet his son and  daughter and the others.    \"It's great news, Dad!\" cried Fred, shaking him warmly by the hand,  while Mary clung around his neck and kissed him.    \"Oh, I'm going to be real proud of you!\" said the daughter.    A little later Dick Rover arrived, and Jack shook hands with a warmth  that was most unusual. When Martha kissed her father a curious lump  arose in her throat, and her eyes grew misty.    \"I suppose it's all right, Dad,\" she whispered in his ear. \"But, oh! I  do hope you'll come back all right.\" And she clung to him in a way  that spoke volumes.    \"Of course I'll come back all right, Martha,\" said Dick Rover  confidently. \"And for all you know, your dad will come back a major or  a colonel, or maybe a brigadier general.\"    \"Oh, I don't care about that! All I want is for you to come back safe  and sound!\"    \"Your father will be up in a little while,\" announced Dick Rover to  the twins. \"He had a meeting to attend in reference to the next  Liberty Loan. He's a tremendously busy man these days.\"    \"But Uncle Dick! he wanted to go to the front just as well as you did,  didn't he?\" questioned Randy eagerly.    \"Of course he wanted to go,\" was the ready response. \"But we couldn't  all go, you know. Somebody had to stay behind to look after our  business interests in Wall Street.\"    \"But--but couldn't you hire somebody else to run the business for  you?\" questioned Andy. Now that he and his brother were face to face  with the fact that their Uncle Dick and their Uncle Sam were going  into the army, it did not look right at all to them to have their  father left behind.    \"We thought something of that, but we really couldn't see how it could  be done. You see, we have a great many important deals under way, and  if those transactions are not looked after carefully, we might stand  to lose a great deal of money.\"    \"I don't care--if dad wanted to go to the front, he should have had  the chance to go!\" burst out Randy.    \"I declare, Randy, you'll be as hard to manage in this affair as your  father was,\" said Dick Rover, with a faint smile.    \"Was he really hard to manage?\" queried Andy eagerly.    \"He sure was! We had to talk to him for several days before he would  agree to remain behind. He told us once that the whole business could  go to pot.\"    \"Hurrah for dad! That's the way I knew he'd act!\" burst out the boy.    \"If I was him I'd let the business go to pot!\" declared Randy. \"What  good will your old business be if those Germans win this war and start  in to rule everything? For all you know, they'll come right over to  New York and take your whole business away from you.\"    \"Well, that might possibly happen,\" put in Sam Rover seriously.  \"Although I don't think it is very probable.\"    Knowing that the young folks were usually very hungry when they got  home and that they always enjoyed home cooking, their mothers had  prepared quite a spread for them. Mrs. Tom Rover had gone downtown to  meet her husband, and now she came back in a flutter of excitement.    \"Hello, Ma! Where is Dad?\" questioned Randy, as he ran up and gave her  a hug and a kiss, followed by his twin.    \"He's downtown, up to his ears in that Liberty Loan business,\"  answered Mrs. Tom Rover. \"Oh, dear! I never saw such a busy man! Half  a dozen men are coming in and going out all the time, wanting to know  what to do next and asking him if he won't make another speech here,  there, or somewhere else. They want him to talk at two Liberty Loan  meetings to-night and one Liberty Loan meeting and a Red Cross meeting  to-morrow afternoon.\"    \"Isn't he coming home at all?\" questioned both of the twins in a  breath.    \"Oh, yes. He'll be here in a little while. But he won't be able to  stay long,\" returned the mother.    When Tom Rover arrived he looked rather tired out, but he greeted all  the boys with a smile and gave each of the girls the kiss he knew they  were expecting.    \"Oh, I'm in it neck deep,\" he answered, in reply to his sons'  questions. \"They must think I can talk just like a coffee-grinder  grinds out coffee. And the nerve of some of them!\" he continued. \"Here  they have asked me to go somewhere uptown and meet a lot of bankers  and tell them how some of the work on the Liberty Loan is to be done!  As if those bankers don't know as much about it as I do, and maybe  more!\"    \"You've bought some of the bonds yourself, haven't you, Dad?\"  questioned Randy.    \"Yes, Son--twenty thousand dollars' worth, and The Rover Company, as a  company, has taken twice that amount.\"    \"And my father has taken twenty thousand dollars' worth, too,\" said  Mary.    \"And so has mine,\" added Martha.    \"All told, I think we're doing pretty well by Uncle Sam!\" cried Jack.  \"Just the same, Uncle Tom, I think it's a shame that they are going to  make you stay behind to run the business.\"    \"I won't stay behind if things get much warmer!\" burst out Tom Rover  suddenly. \"I'll put somebody in my place and grab a gun and go after  those Huns.\"    \"Hurrah! that's the way to talk,\" cried Andy enthusiastically.    \"Would you really, Dad?\" burst out Randy, his eyes shining.    \"Do you want me to go, Son?\" demanded the father, catching him by the  shoulder.    \"Of course I do! I don't think you ought to stay behind with Uncle  Dick and Uncle Sam going.\"    \"It doesn't seem right,\" added his twin.    \"And it isn't right! But what am I going to do?\" asked their father  somewhat helplessly. \"We've all our money locked up in our various  business deals. Those deals have got to be looked after. Who is going  to do it if we all go away?\"    \"Oh, you can get somebody!\"    \"This getting somebody that you can trust absolutely is not so easy,\"  answered Tom Rover. \"I did think of getting one gentleman we know  very well--a Mr. Allen Charter, who graduated from Brill College a  year after your uncles and I were admitted to the institution. Mr.  Charter is a very fine business man, and understands the deals we are  in perfectly.\"    \"Well, then, why didn't you get Mr. Allen"]]]
