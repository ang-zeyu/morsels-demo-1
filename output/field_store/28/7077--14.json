She had grown  enormously in the last few months--\"grown out of all conscience\", said  Beatrice, who sighed ruefully over boots too small and skirts too  short--and she had become so pale and lanky and angular in the process  that Winnie unfeelingly compared her to a plant raised in a cellar.  Her unlucky hands and feet seemed bigger than ever, and more inclined  to fidget and shuffle, and to her bad habit of wrinkling up her  forehead she had added a nervous blink of her eyes.    \"Winnie Gascoyne is charming,\" confided Miss Douglas to a fellow  mistress, \"and Lesbia is about the loveliest child I've ever seen. I  can't imagine why Gwen should vary from pretty to plain continually.  But she does.\"    Unfortunately, Gwen's temper suffered in exact proportion to her  increased inches. She was snappy at school and snarly at home,  difficult to please, and ready to take offence at everything. Probably  a week's rest in bed, on a feeding diet and a good tonic, was what her  tired body and irritable nerves required, but nobody had the hardihood  to make such a suggestion. Except in cases of dire necessity, the  Gascoynes did not indulge in the luxury of medical advice or chemist's  bills, so Gwen perforce did without a doctor, and the medicine he  would most undoubtedly have prescribed for her. So far from thinking  of rest, she was making plans sufficient to fill five holidays instead  of one; even she herself laughed sometimes at the largeness of her  projects compared with the brief month in which she was to carry them  out.    Meantime the two days of the dramatic performances had arrived. The  Seniors always had the first afternoon and the Juniors the second, the  audience being composed of the rest of the school together with the  mistresses. The outside public was not invited, as the little plays  were only intended to be acted among the girls themselves. The Sixth  naturally led off, and Gwen quaked as she sat with her Form in front  of the heavy red curtains. She was afraid an unpleasant surprise  awaited her comrades, and she wondered how they would take it. Exactly  what she expected happened. The bell rang, the curtains were drawn  aside to reveal--alas, alas, for the Fifth!--a very excellently got up  trial scene from the _Merchant of Venice_. Bessie Manners, the head of  the school, was a majestic Portia in a handsome scarlet robe; Winnie  made an attractive Nerissa; while all the other characters were  arrayed in slightly more sumptuous costumes than Elspeth and Hilda had  been able to collect.    A shudder of cold horror ran through the unfortunate Fifth, the  dramatic representatives of which listened with a kind of fascination  to their own speeches, tripped off lightly and easily by their  Seniors. It was more particularly galling as all realized that the  whole thing was on a rather higher scale than theirs; it was better  staged, much prompter, the actions were more appropriate, and the  players less stiff and self-conscious, to say nothing of the superior  dresses. In gloomy resignation they sat the scene out, and had the  magnanimity to applaud heartily at the end. Then came the crisis.    \"We can't possibly give the very same thing all over again,\" whispered  Hilda to Elspeth. \"We shall just have to announce that ours is 'off'.\"    Deeply humiliated and disgusted, the Fifth retired to its own  classroom to discuss the untoward event.    \"It's too sickening--when I'd borrowed the wig on purpose!\" wailed  Hilda. \"You can't think how I had to pester Dad to lend it.\"    \"And my Bassanio doublet and tights were made at a dressmaker's!\"  lamented Louise Mawson.    \"Who'd have thought of the Sixth choosing that very scene?\"    \"Well, I tried to persuade you to take something else instead,\"  declared Gwen, offering Job's comfort to the disappointed ones.    \"Gwen Gascoyne, I verily believe you knew all the time what the Sixth  were going to have.\"    \"You must have known when your sister was in it.\"    \"I wasn't sure, but I had an inkling,\" confessed Gwen.    \"Then why didn't you tell?\" howled the girls in chorus.    \"Why? Because it didn't seem fair. Winnie hadn't said a word--I only  guessed. You know we're all supposed to keep our own secrets.\"    \"In this case you ought to have warned us properly. It was too bad to  let us rehearse all that time, and get all the costumes together--for  this!\"    \"We've made ourselves ridiculous, and it's your fault entirely.\"    \"Couldn't you act it here, just among ourselves?\" suggested Gwen  humbly; but her proposal was squashed by an indignant and scornful  majority.    \"Act it here indeed! Who'd care to do that, I wonder? Don't be so  idiotic. You've spoilt our performance, Gwen Gascoyne, when you might  have saved it. Why couldn't you stay in the Lower School? You haven't  sense enough to be a Senior.\"    It was not a very satisfactory ending to a first term, even though  Gwen had done better in the exams than she expected, so that her place  in her new Form was well assured. She still felt an outcast, and as  she shut her desk for the last time on breaking-up day, she gave a  sigh of intense relief to think that she was going to enjoy a whole  month's freedom from the society of her classmates.    Home at present was the _summum bonum_ of her wishes. She almost  danced along the road from school, and behaved so jubilantly in the  bus that Winnie had to interfere, and give her a hint to restrain her  hilarity before the other passengers. She rushed into the Parsonage  like a cyclone, and flung her satchel under the bookcase.    \"There! That's done with! Hurrah! No more horrid, hateful, scrambly,  early breakfasts, and tramping off through the mud. Every day's a  Saturday, and I'm just going to have a glorious time.\"    \"There's plenty for you to do,\" said Beatrice, fishing out the satchel  and putting it tidily away on Gwen's special shelf. \"I haven't  finished those texts I was making for the church yet, and--\"    \"Oh, wow! Don't set me to work too soon! I've a heap of things of my  own that want doing first. Winnie is far cleverer at cutting texts  than I am.\"    \"She's more to be depended upon, certainly,\" said Beatrice dryly.    Each member of the family was mysteriously occupied with special  secrets. There were still five days before Christmas, time for an  energetic person to get through a great deal, and Gwen hoped to  accomplish wonders. She was in a sad quandary about her Christmas  gifts. Her savings box, which ought to have contained over fifteen  shillings, only held a threepennybit and two halfpennies; and she  shook her head dismally as she reviewed her pauper condition.    \"I must make presents, that's the long and short of it,\" she told  herself. \"They can't be handsome ones. And, oh dear! they'll all think  me so horribly stingy and mean. Well, they'll have to, for I can't  explain! It's absolutely sickening, but it's inevitable.\"    So Gwen shut herself up in her bedroom, locked out the injured Lesbia,  who had plans of her own which she wished to pursue in privacy, put on  a thick jacket and a pair of mittens to keep herself warm, and set to  work bravely. It is rather hard to make bricks without straw, and her  supply of materials, mostly purloined from Beatrice's piece-box, was  decidedly scanty. She held a review of the articles when she had  finished, and screwed up her face over them in expressive  dissatisfaction.    \"They're a shabby little lot, that's flat!\" she decided.    She turned them over disconsolately--the needle-book for Beatrice, not  too tidily sewn; the blotter for Winnie, with its brown paper cover,  hastily painted with a spray of roses, and its one sheet of blotting  paper begged from Father's writing-table; the pincushion for Lesbia,  trimmed with a piece of washed ribbon; and the two postcard albums for  Basil and Giles, made out of pieces of cardboard with slits cut in the  corners.    \"I can afford to spend the threepennybit on Father and Martin,\" she  thought; \"but I must leave the halfpennies to rattle in my box, so  that it doesn't sound empty.\"    The village shop did not offer a very large selection of goods for an  expenditure of threepence. Gwen was almost at her wits' end what to  choose, and finally came away with a cake of oatmeal soap and a large  red chalk pencil. Walking back up the village she met Beatrice.    \"I've just been to see the Casses,\" said the latter. \"They're in awful  trouble. Thomas Cass has sprained his wrist and can't go out in his  boat, and Mrs. Cass is in bed with bronchitis. Johnnie's running about  with his toes all through his boots, and says he can't come to church  or Sunday School because he hasn't another pair.\"    \"Haven't you an old pair of Lesbia's or Stumps's?\" suggested Gwen.    \"Not one. We sold them all at the Rummage Sale.\"    \"Then he'll have to go barefoot, I suppose.\"    \"I was wondering,\" said Beatrice tentatively, \"if we could manage to  get him a pair ourselves. Winnie would give something, I'm sure, and  so would I, and so would Father.\"    Gwen was silent.    \"I thought perhaps as you'd rescued him you might feel interested in  him, and you'd care--\"    Beatrice did not finish the sentence, but looked at her sister  hopefully.    Gwen stared at the ground and went very red, but she said nothing, and  Beatrice, after waiting a moment, turned away and entered the post  office.    \"Of all absolute frauds, I feel the meanest!\" groaned Gwen. \"Beatrice  will think me a perfect miser, hoarding up my money and not willing to  spend a farthing on anybody! If she only knew the bankruptcy of my  box! Was any wretched girl ever in such a fix? Oh! Gwen Gascoyne,  you've got yourself into an atrocious mess altogether, and I don't see  how you're ever going to climb out of it.\"    Gwen's one sheet anchor of hope, to which she clung in a kind of  desperation, was the thought of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#14)"],[1," Finnian at Moville, and under another of the same name at  Clonard. In 546 he founded the monastery of Derry, and in 553 that of  Durrow. The belief that he had caused the bloody battle of Culdremhne  led to his excommunication and exile from his native land, and,  accompanied by twelve disciples, he left Ireland and sailed for the  Western Islands, settling ultimately at Iona, where he and his  companions began their work among the heathen Picts. The legend of his  perpetual exile seems to be a fable, and Dr. Skene adds, \"His real  motive for undertaking this mission seems therefore to have been partly  religious and partly political. He was one of the twelve apostles of  Ireland who had emerged from the school of Finnian of Clonard, and he no  doubt shared the missionary spirit which so deeply characterised the  monastic Church of Ireland at that period. He was also closely  connected through his grandmother with the line of the Dalriadic kings,  and, as an Irishman, must have been interested in the maintenance of the  Irish colony in the west of Scotland. Separated from him by the Irish  Channel was the great pagan nation of the Northern Picts, who, under a  powerful king, had just inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Scots of  Dalriada, and threatened their expulsion from the country; and, while  his missionary zeal impelled him to attempt the conversion of the Picts,  he must have felt that, if he succeeded in winning a pagan people to the  religion of Christ, he would at the same time rescue the Irish colony of  Dalriada from a great danger, and render them an important service by  establishing peaceable relations between them and their greatly more  numerous and powerful neighbours, and replacing them in the more secure  possession of the western districts they had colonised.\"[190] It was in  563, and at the age of forty-two, that he settled at Iona and commenced  his mission-work by founding his monastery[191] there. He met there \"two  bishops,\" who came to receive his submission from him, but \"God now  revealed to Columcille that they were not true bishops, whereupon they  left the island to him, when he told of them their history.\" They were,  thinks Dr. Skene, the remains of that anomalous church of seven bishops  which here, as elsewhere, preceded the monastic church, while Columba  appears to have refused to recognise them as such, and the island was  abandoned to him. Possessed as he was with the soul of a poet, and  susceptible to the impressive in nature, Columba could not have chosen a  finer spot than Iona for his work, or one where he could better combine  with missionary activity a life of purity and self-denial. Tradition  says he landed at the bay now known as Port-a-churaich, and proceeded  to found the monastery and establish the church which was ultimately to  embrace in its jurisdiction the whole of Scotland north of the Firths of  Forth and Clyde, to be for a century and a half the national church of  Scotland, and to give to the Angles of Northumbria the same form of  Christianity for a period of thirty years. The buildings that now remain  are of much later date, but it may be inferred that in its constitution,  spirit, and work the Columban Church was not isolated, but was in  reality a mission from the Irish Church, formed an integral part of it,  and never lost its connection with it. The principal buildings were  constructed of wood and wattles, and were originally (1) a monastery  with a small court, on one side of which was the church, with a small  side chamber, on a second side the guest-chamber, on the third a  refectory, and on the fourth dwellings of the monks; a little way off on  the highest part of the ground were (2) the cell of St. Columba, where  he sat and read or wrote during the day, and slept at night on the bare  ground with a stone for his pillow; and (3) various subsidiary  buildings, including a kiln, a mill, a barn, all surrounded by a rampart  or rath. Not far off was a sequestered hollow (Cabhan cuildeach) to  which Columba retired for solitary prayer. The mill has left its traces  in the small stream to the north of the present cathedral ruins, and  remains of old causeways may be traced from the landing places of  Port-na-martir, Port-Ronan, and Port-na-muintir. All the early  buildings, except the kiln, were of wood; the guest-chamber was wattled,  Columba's cell was made of planks, and the church was of oak. The  members of the community were termed brethren, and were addressed by  Columba as familia or chosen monks. They consisted of three classes: (1)  the older brethren, who devoted themselves to the religious services of  the church, and to reading and transcribing the Scriptures; (2) the  younger and stronger working brothers, who devoted themselves to  agriculture and the service of the monastery; (3) the alumni or youth,  who were under instruction. The dress of the monks consisted of a white  tunica or undergarment, over which they wore a camilla, consisting of a  body and hood made of wool, and of the natural colour of the material.  When working or travelling their feet were shod with sandals; they took  a solemn monastic vow on bended knees in the oratorium, were tonsured  from ear to ear--the fore part of the head being made bare, and the hair  allowed to grow only on the back part of the head. The church of Iona  was monastic, and in it we find neither a territorial episcopacy nor a  presbyterian parity. The bishops were under the monastic rule, and were,  in respect of jurisdiction, subject to the abbot, even though a  presbyter, as the head of the monastery; the privilege of the episcopate  was not interfered with.[192] The monastery was described as a  \"gloriosum caenobium.\"    Columba made Iona his centre of activity, but his labours were not  confined to it. He travelled with his companions and preached the Gospel  as far north as Inverness, where King Brude was converted. He also  preached among the Southern Picts, and a church was built at Abernethy  by King Gartnaidh, as an outcome of his mission and as a memorial of his  labours. He was also a far-seeing statesman, and succeeded in  reconciling the feuds of the Northern and Southern Picts, and in making  the two kingdoms one. His life was spent in missionary activity and  beneficent service, and he died at Iona. The day before his death he  \"ascended the hill that overlooketh the monastery, and stood for some  little time on its summit, and as he stood there with both hands  uplifted, he blessed his monastery, saying, 'Small and mean though this  place is, yet it shall be held in great and unusual honour, not only by  Scotic kings and people, but also by the rulers of foreign and barbarous  nations, and by their subjects; the saints also, even of other churches,  shall regard it with no common reverence.'\" On the following day, at  nocturnal vigils, he went into the church, and knelt down in prayer  beside the altar, and \"his attendant Diormit, who more slowly followed  him, saw from a distance that the whole interior of the church was  filled with a heavenly light in the direction of the saint,\" which, as  he drew near, quickly disappeared. \"Feeling his way in the darkness, as  the brethren had not yet brought in the lights, he found the saint lying  before the altar,\" and all the monks coming in, Columba moved his hand  to give them his benediction, and died 9th June 597, while \"the whole  church resounded with loud lamentations of grief.\" He left behind him an  imperishable memory in the hearts of the people converted by him to the  Christian faith, and in the national church which he so splendidly  helped to build up. He wrote an Altus, and is said to have copied 300  books with his own hand. He was buried at Iona.    After Columba's death, the monastery of Iona appears to have been the  acknowledged head of all the monasteries and churches which his mission  had founded in Scotland, as well as of those previously founded by him  in Ireland. It was a centre of light and life, but the monks were not  permitted to pursue their work unmolested. The monastery was burned and  plundered by the sea-pirates in 795, 798, and 802; in 806 sixty-eight of  the community were ruthlessly slain. The monks remaining were filled  with fear, and before 807 the relics of St. Columba were carried away to  Ireland, and enshrined at Kells. In 818 they were brought back, and the  monastery at Iona was rebuilt with stone. The Danes, however, granted  little respite, and in 878 the relics were again removed, and were  probably placed first at Dunkeld and afterwards at Abernethy,[193] where  the primacy was successively established, and a memorial of which exists  in the Abernethy round tower. The plundering continued at intervals, and  the buildings were more or less ruinous till about 1074, when Queen  Margaret \"restored the monastery, ... rebuilt it, and furnished it with  monks, with an endowment for performing the Lord's work.\" \"One of the  present buildings,\" said the late Duke of Argyll--\"the least and the  most inconspicuous, but the most venerable of them all--St. Odhrain's  Chapel, may possibly be the same building which Queen Margaret of  Scotland is known to have erected in memory of the saint, and dedicated  to one of the most famous of his companions. But Queen Margaret died in  A.D. 1092, and therefore any building which she erected must date very  nearly five hundred years after Columba's death; that is to say, the  most ancient building which exists upon Iona must be separated in age  from Columba's time by as many centuries as those which now separate us  from Edward III. But St. Odhrain's Chapel has this great interest--that  in all probability it marks the site of the still humbler church of wood  and wattles in which Columba worshipped.\"[194] Shortly afterwards the  island passed into the possession of Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway,  and in 1099 the old order culminated in"]]]
