And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in  the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and  the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her.    \"Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,\" she cried, and hung around the Queen's  neck as if she would never let go.    \"Now,\" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for  them, \"I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not  make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer  comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the  tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I  say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if  ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a  happy old woman.\"    Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said  the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One  of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand;  but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin  and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good  education.    And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day  always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and  kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and  some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the  world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the  griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time,  from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming,  creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except  the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and  in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in  triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl,  bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her  dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who  had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken  their wise young heads and said: \"'Bout ship!\" and gone discreetly home  to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms.    But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the  years went by.    Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your  slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who  was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and  keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as  you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince.    Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world--and it knows  when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the  farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear.    And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out  over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far  away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: \"What light  is that?\"    Then the skipper said: \"All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing  near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked  in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me,  and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from  the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my  father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his  great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess,  fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance,  so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is  only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real.\"    So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he  sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time  the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine  Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper  asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone  over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till  daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to  dread.    But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the  pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of  black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and  on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven  days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you  give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the  first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman  Kings.    What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes  that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide  went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened,  but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day  before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had  thoughtfully brought with him.    [Illustration: \"The Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools.\"  _See page 88._]    So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And  when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like  water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put  his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow  sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait.    By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and  busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge  overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with  golden hair and a green gown--and he went out to meet her.    \"I've come to save you,\" he said. \"How darling and beautiful you are!\"    \"You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,\" said the Princess,  smiling and giving him both her hands.    He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.    \"So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,\"  he said.    \"But what about the dragon and the griffin?\" asked the Princess.    \"Dear me,\" said Nigel. \"I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill  them?\"    \"Don't be a silly boy,\" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown  up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many  years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. \"You  haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!\"    \"Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?\"    \"Why, yes,\" said the Princess, \"but only once in twenty-four hours, and  then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The  griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for  five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the  day before.\"    \"What time does he sleep today?\" asked Nigel.    \"At eleven,\" said the Princess.    \"Ah,\" said Nigel, \"can you do sums?\"    \"No,\" said the Princess sadly. \"I was never good at them.\"    \"Then I must,\" said Nigel. \"I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me  very unhappy. It'll take me days and days.\"    \"Don't begin yet,\" said the Princess. \"You'll have plenty of time to be  unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself.\"    So he did. And then she told him all about herself.    \"I know I've been here a long time,\" she said, \"but I don't know what  Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my  wedding day. And the griffin does the housework--his wings are so  convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does  the cooking--he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and  though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day,  because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve,  and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready.\"    Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and  a snorting sound. \"It's the dragon,\" said the Princess hurriedly.  \"Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done.\" And she ran away and  left him to his arithmetic.    Now, the sum was this: \"If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down  once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier  every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does  it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in  the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls  asleep?\"    It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute  because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your  lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work  out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by  practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by  rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by  compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried  it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples  in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the  sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry,  by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an  answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he  could not feel sure which answer was right.    And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it  is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#14)"],[1,"s, and told him  what to do. Away went the Blue-jay to the mountain at the top of which  was the Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo making thunder in his throat. The Blue-jay  flew up to his ear, and said: \"Pooh, Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo, you don't call  that a big noise! You should hear Niagara; then you would never twitter  again.\"    The Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo was so mad at hearing his big wonderful song  called a twitter, that he said: \"Niagara, Niagara! I'm sick of hearing  about Niagara. I will go and silence Niagara with my voice.\" So he flew  to Niagara while the Blue-jay snickered and followed to see the fun.    Now when Niagara Falls was made the Great Spirit said to it, \"Flow on  for ever.\" That last word of the Great Spirit it took up as it rushed  on, and never ceases to thunder out \"For ever! For ever! For ever!\"    When they came to Niagara the mighty cataract, the Blue-jay said, \"Now,  Gitchee, you can beat that I am sure.\" So Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo began  bawling to drown the noise of it, but could not make himself heard.    \"Wa-wa-wa,\" said the Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo, with great effort and only for  a few heart beats.    \"_For ever, For ever, For ever_,\" thundered the river, steadily, easily,  ceaselessly.    \"Wa-wa-wa--!\" shrieked Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo; but his voice was so utterly  lost that he could not hear it himself, and he began to feel small, and  smaller; and as he began to feel small, a strange thing happened--he  began to get small and smaller, until he was no bigger than a Sparrow;  and his voice, instead of being like a great cataract, became like the  dropping of water, just a little            Tink-tank-tink,          Tink-tank-tink.    And this is why the Indians give to this smallest of the Owls the name  of \"The Water-dropping Bird,\" who was once the greatest of all  creatures, but is now shrunk to be the littlest of the Owls, because he  became proud and forgot the Great Spirit.      TALE 44    The Wood-witch and the Bog-nuts    Once upon a time there was a rich boy, who knew all about the city, and  nothing about the woods. He went for an outing into the wilderness, and  got lost. He wandered all day until he was very tired and hungry. The  sun was low when he came to a little pathway. He followed it, and it led  to a small log cabin. When he knocked, an old woman opened the door. He  said, \"Please, Ma'am, I am lost and very hungry, will you give me  something to eat?\"    [Illustration: The Wood-witch and the Bog-nuts]    The old woman looked sharply at his clothes, and knew that he was  rich, so she said: \"Poor people are wise, they can take care of  themselves in the woods. They don't get lost. But you rich people are  fools, and I wish you would go away.\"    \"I will, if you'll give me something to eat,\" he answered.    Then the old woman said: \"Listen, foolish rich boy, in the woods beside  you right now is a friend who feeds the poor people, maybe she will feed  you. She is tall and slim, her eyes are brownish purple and her hair is  green, and by this you may know her--she has five fingers on one hand  and seven on the other. Her house is in the brier thicket; she climbs to  the roof and stands there all day waving her hands, and shouting out in  wood-talk, 'There are cocoanuts in my cellar.'    \"Now go and find her, maybe she will feed you. She always feeds us poor  folks,\" and the witch slammed the door.    The boy was puzzled. As he stood in doubt, there was a loud noise, and  his friends arrived. They brought him the food and comfort that he  needed.    Then he said: \"I wish to know what that old wood-witch meant by the lady  with the purple eyes and green hair.\" So he went again to the log cabin  and knocked.    When the old woman came, and saw a lot of people about, she was  frightened for she knew she had been unkind. But the boy said: \"Now  Granny, you needn't be afraid, I want you to show me the friend that has  seven fingers and a cellar full of cocoanuts.\"    \"I'll show you, if you promise to do me no harm,\" she answered.    \"Of course, I'll promise,\" replied the boy.    Then Granny Wood-witch went hobbling to the nearest thicket and cackled  out loud, as she pointed out a trailing vine that had sometimes five  leaflets on a stalk and sometimes seven. \"See, see, that's the lady.  See seven fingers on that hand and five on this. Now follow her feet  down and dig in the ground.\"    They dug and found strings of lovely brown nuts as big as walnuts.    \"See, see,\" chuckled the wood-witch. \"See the cocoanuts in the cellar.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Go forth and look for it, ye Woodcrafters. You will find it throughout  Eastern America on the edge of every wood. Its flower is like a  purple-brown sweet-pea, and is in bloom all summer long. Follow down its  vine, dig out a few of the potatoes or nuts, and try them, raw, boiled,  or if ye wish to eat them as Indian Cake, clean them, cut them in  slices, dry till hard, pound them up into meal, and make a cake the same  as you would of oatmeal.    The wild things love them, the Indians love them, and this was the bread  of the wood-witch. The books call it Bog Potato and Ground Nuts. It is  the third secret of the woods.      TALE 45    The Mud-dauber Wasp    If you look under the roof of any wooden barn in Eastern America you are  likely to see the nest of the common Mud-wasp.    [Illustration: The Mud-dauber Wasp (life size)]    If you look on warm sunny days along the edge of some mud puddle you are  sure to see a curious steel-blue wasp, with a very thin waist, working  away at a lump of mud. She seems to be breathing hard with her body, as  she works with her yellow legs, but she finally goes off laden with a  gob of mud. This is the Mud-wasp at work, building a strong mud-nest for  her family. The nest is the one we have seen hung under the roof of  the shed, always put where no rain can reach it.    In the drawing are two of these nests.    Once the cradle is ready, the mother Wasp goes spider-hunting. Whenever  she can find a spider, she pounces on it, and with her sting, she stabs  it in the body, so as to paralyze it, but not kill it. Then she carries  it to the mud cell and packs it in, at the far end. Many spiders are  caught and preserved this way, for they do not usually die though they  cannot move.    When the cell is full, the Wasp lays an egg on the last spider, and  seals up the opening with a mud lid.    Very soon the egg hatches out a little white grub which begins on the  spider next to him, eating the legs first, and the body last, so as to  keep it alive as long as possible, though of course the spider has no  feeling. Then he eats the next spider, and the next, growing as he eats,  until he nearly fills the cell, and the spiders are all eaten up.    Now the grub goes to sleep, and next spring comes out as a full-grown  Mud-wasp to do exactly as the mother did, though it never saw that  Mother or had a lesson from any one in the many strange things it must  do to live.    I went into my boat-house to-day, November 20, 1919, to get a mud nest  for this drawing. There were 86 on the roof; some of them with 20 or 30  cells, and besides there was a lot of paper nests by other Wasps. The  nest I took had two cells, one open and empty, and the other with a mud  lid on tight. This held a long, shiny brown transparent case, in which  was a white grub much too small for the big coat he was wearing. The  grub was sound asleep, and would have come out next spring, as a big  steel-blue Mud-wasp had I let him alone. But there are plenty of  Mud-wasps so I fed him to the Chicadees, which likely is what Mother  Carey would have done.    [Illustration: The Cicada and the Katydid (life size)]      TALE 46    The Cicada and the Katydid    Once upon a time, long, long ago, the birds whose job it was to make the  woods merry with their songs, decided to go on strike. They said, \"We  have sung all day, all springtime, and half way through the summer, but  now we are moulting, the weather is frightfully hot; we need a rest, and  we are going to stop singing, to take a holiday.\"    Then Dame Nature, who is sometimes called the All-mother, or Mother  Carey, said: \"Dear me, this will never do! No songbirds, woods silent  all through the dog-days. Now who will be strike-breakers and volunteer  to supply the music till the birds get once more in a good humour?\"    Then up at that question got a long-winged insect like a big fly, and a  long-legged insect like a green grasshopper, and both said at once, \"I  will.\" Amid low murmurs of \"Scab! Scab!\" from many of the Wood-birds.    \"You. I forgot that you two had any voices at all!\" said Mother Carey.    Then the long-winged creature, whose name is Cicada, began, \"True, my  voice isn't much, but I have invented a most successful musical  Castanet. Listen!\"    Then he began an extraordinary racket like an alarm clock, a threshing  machine, and a buzz-saw all going together. He filled the grove with his  noise, and set all the woodfolk laughing with his funny performance.  Though, of course, he didn't mean to be funny; he thought it was fine.    Then as the Cicada ceased, Mother Carey said to the Green Hopper, whose  name was Katy, \"Now, Katy, what can you do?\"    \"I do not brag of my voice, dear Mother,\" said she, \"but I am a  thrilling performer on the violin.\"    Then she humped herself up over a green fiddle that she had under her  cloak, and nearly deafened them with its hoarse screechings.    There was no doubt that these two could make as much noise as a wood  full of birds; both were eager to take sole charge, and a bitter dispute  arose as to whose idea it was first.    But Mother Carey settled it by dividing the time. \"You,\" she said to  Cicada, \"can take charge of the music by day, and you,\" she said to the  Green one, \"must take it up at sundown in place of the nightingale, and  keep it up, till the night breaks, and both of you continue till the  frost comes, or until"]]]
