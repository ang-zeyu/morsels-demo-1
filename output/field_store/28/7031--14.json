I was  riding with a couple of servants and some horses to the Caspian shore  from the interior of Persia, and encamped one evening at a village in  the Elburz Mountains. The caravanserai was notorious for its vermin, so  I preferred to make myself comfortable in a garden with fruit trees and  poplars, protected by a wall five feet high and without any gates. We  had to climb over the wall in order to get in. I had a saddle for a  pillow and lay wrapped in a felt rug and a cloak. The remains of my  supper, bread, honey, and apples, stood on my two small leather trunks.  When it grew dark my men went off to the village and I rolled myself up  and went to sleep.    Two hours later I was awakened by a scratching noise at the trunks and  sat up to listen, but could hear nothing but the murmur of a small brook  close at hand. The darkness was intense, only a little starlight passing  faintly through the foliage. So I went to sleep again. A little later I  was roused once more by the same noise, and heard a tearing and tugging  at the straps. Then I jumped up and distinguished half a dozen jackals  disappearing like shadows among the poplars. There was no more sleep for  me that night. It was all I could do to keep the importunate beasts at a  distance. If I kept quiet for a minute they were up again, tearing the  leathern straps, and would not make off until I struck a box with my  riding whip. They soon became accustomed even to this and drew back only  a few steps. Then I remembered the apples, and as soon as the jackals  crept up again, I threw one of them with all my strength into the ruck,  and used them as missiles till the last apple had disappeared into the  darkness. Most of my shots were misses, for I only once heard a howl  from one of the impudent animals.    The night seemed endless, but at length the day dawned between the  poplars, and the jackals jumped quietly over the wall. Then I should  have liked some breakfast, but there was not a bit of the supper left;  the jackals had taken it all. However, I had a sound sleep instead. I  heard afterwards that the jackals in that country are so vicious that  two or three of them will attack a man, so in future I always had my  servants sleeping near me.    While speaking of jackals we must not forget the hyaena, for this animal  is one of the denizens of the desert, though it is of another genus. The  hyaena is a singular animal, neither dog nor cat, but a mixture of both  and larger than either. It is of a dirty greyish-brown colour with black  stripes or patches, has a rounded head with black muzzle and eyes, and  short hind legs, so that the bristly back slopes downwards. It prowls  about for food at night, and in western Persia comes down from its  hiding-places in the mountains to the caravan roads in quest of fallen  asses, horses and camels. If corpses are not buried deep enough it  scratches them up from beneath the tombstones, for it lives almost  exclusively on dead and corrupted flesh.    Thus the four-footed inhabitants of the desert prowl around the  outskirts of Tebbes and share the country with panthers, wild asses and  graceful elegant gazelles. Tebbes itself lies lonely and forgotten like  an island in the ocean.    The principal caravan road connecting the oasis with the outer world  runs north-eastwards to the holy town of Meshed, whither many pilgrims  flock. From Meshed it is only a few days' journey through a mountainous  tract to the frontier between Persia and Russian Asia. There lie  Transcaspia, Samarcand, Bukhara, Turkestan, and the Kirghiz Steppe. This  road would take us out of our way to India, but while we halt at Tebbes  I can tell you something about the country it passes through.          V    ON THE KIRGHIZ STEPPE (1893-5)      INTO ASIA FROM ORENBURG    I started my journey across the Kirghiz Steppe in November, 1893, from  Orenburg on the Ural River, which for some distance forms the boundary  between Asia and Europe. I travelled in a stout _tarantass_, the common  means of conveyance on Russian country roads; it consists of a sort of a  box on two bars between the wheel axles, with a hood but no seat. The  bottom is filled with hay, on which are spread a mat, cushions and  pillows, furs and felt rugs, for the cold is intense. There are  ninety-nine stages and changes of horses between Orenburg and Tashkent,  the capital of Russian Turkestan. At the post-houses nothing can be got  but tea, so provisions for nineteen days had to be taken with us, as  well as sawn wood, rope and tools in case anything should break, and a  large pot of cart-grease to keep the wheels cool. My boxes and trunks  are wrapped in bast-matting and secured with strong ropes to the  driver's box and behind the _tarantass_. It takes time to get everything  ready, and it is late in the afternoon before the first team of three  post-horses is led out and harnessed to the vehicle. I take my largest  fur coat and pack myself in among the cushions and felt rugs. The  carriage is open in front and the whirling snow which sweeps round the  corners flies straight into my face. The driver takes his seat on the  box, shouts shrilly and cracks his whip, and we dash along the streets  of Orenburg in the snow and twilight to the lively jingle of the bells.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING JOURNEY FROM ORENBURG TO THE PAMIR (pp. 55-71).]    The lights come to an end and the night is intensely dark when we come  out to the high-road leading into Asia. The bells worn by the middle  horse on a necklace round his neck ring in frequent beats. This horse  always goes at a trot, being harnessed between the shafts with a high  wooden arch above his neck, but the two outside horses go at a canter.  The horses are accustomed to this pace and action, and a rapidly moving  team is a fine sight. After three hours a yellow light is seen through  the swirling snow, and the team dashes into a yard and comes to a halt  at the steps of a house. As I have been already tossed about a good  deal, I am glad to jump out and get a glass of tea. The horses are  taken into the stable, and a fresh team is led out to take their place  in the still warm harness.    The _samovar_, or Russian tea-urn, is boiling in the great room. While I  am drinking my first glass of tea the stamping and rattle is heard of  two other teams which roll into the yard. It is the post; and the  courier enters covered with snow and with icicles on his beard. He is a  good fellow, and we become acquainted at once and travel together to  Orsk. He has travelled for twenty years with the mails between the two  towns and must have covered altogether a distance as far as from the  earth to the moon and six thousand miles besides.    My new driver now appears and calls out \"The _troika_[8] is ready.\" Then  I pack myself in again among the cushions and rugs and off we speed once  more through the darkness and snow.    After forty-eight hours we are in Orsk, which also stands on the Ural  River; and when we leave this town with fresh horses and steer  southwards we are on Asiatic ground, in the vast Kirghiz Steppe, which  extends from Irkutsk to the Caspian Sea, from the Ural River to the  Syr-darya.[9] It is extremely flat and looks like a frozen sea. Day  after day we drive southwards, the horses ready to run away; there is  nothing to drive over, no ditches to fall into, no stones to carry away  a wheel. The hoofs hammer on the hard ground, the wheels creak, I and my  things are shaken and thrown about in the carriage, the coachman plants  his feet firmly against the foot-board lest he should tumble off, and on  we go over the flat dreary steppe. As we drive on day and night the  _tarantass_ seems always to be in the centre of the same unbroken  landscape, always at the same distance from the horizon.    Here live the Kirghizes, a fine race of graziers and horsemen. They  support themselves by their large flocks of sheep, and also own numerous  horses and camels, as well as cattle. Therefore they are dependent on  the grass of the steppe, and wander like other nomads from pasture to  pasture. When their flocks have eaten up the grass at one place, they  roll up their black tents, pack all their belongings on camels and  migrate to another spot. They are a freeborn, manly people and love the  boundless steppe. Life in the open air and on the level country, which  affords grazing to their flocks, has sharpened their intellect to a  wonderful degree. They never forget a place they have once seen. If the  steppe plants grow closer or thinner, if the ground shows the slightest  inequality, if there is grey or black gravel of different  coarseness--all these details serve as marks of recognition. When we  rest a minute halfway between two post-houses to let the horses breathe,  the Kirghiz driver turns round and says, \"Yonder rides a Kirghiz on a  dappled mare.\" Yet on directing my field-glass towards the indicated  spot, I can only see a small dot, and cannot distinguish what it is.    The stations on our road are usually small solid wooden houses with two  lamp-posts at the door and a white board, on which are written the  distances to the next stations in each direction. In some places there  is no house at all but only a black Kirghiz tent, and instead of a  stable fences of sticks and reeds afford the horses shelter. At one such  station three camels are harnessed to the _tarantass_, and the clumsy  animals waddle along so that their humps bob and roll on their backs.  The reason for this change is that we are now on the shore of the Sea of  Aral, where the soft yielding drifts make it impossible for horses to  draw the _tarantass_. The two rivers, the Syr-darya (or Jaxartes) and  the Amu-darya (or Oxus), which rise in the Pamir, flow into the Sea of  Aral. The Cossacks carry on a profitable sturgeon fishery in this lake,  which in area "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#14)"],[1,"took no notice while the dog and the boy  passed by them. At one door Nello paused and looked wistfully within;  his grandfather had done many a kindly turn in neighbour's service to  the people who dwelt there.    \"Would you give Patrasche a crust?\" he said, timidly. \"He is old, and he  has had nothing since last forenoon.\"    The woman shut the door hastily, murmuring some vague saying about wheat  and rye being very dear that season. The boy and the dog went on again  wearily; they asked no more.    By slow and painful ways they reached Antwerp as the chimes tolled ten.    \"If I had anything about me I could sell to get him bread!\" thought  Nello; but he had nothing except the wisp of linen and serge that  covered him, and his pair of wooden shoes.    Patrasche understood, and nestled his nose into the lad's hand as though  to pray him not to be disquieted for any woe or want of his.    The winner of the drawing prize was to be proclaimed at noon, and to the  public building where he had left his treasure Nello made his way. On  the steps and in the entrance-hall there was a crowd of youths,--some of  his age, some older, all with parents or relatives or friends. His heart  was sick with fear as he went among them holding Patrasche close to him.  The great bells of the city clashed out the hour of noon with brazen  clamour. The doors of the inner hall were opened; the eager, panting  throng rushed in. It was known that the selected picture would be raised  above the rest upon a wooden dais.    A mist obscured Nello's sight, his head swam, his limbs almost failed  him. When his vision cleared he saw the drawing raised on high; it was  not his own! A slow, sonorous voice was proclaiming aloud that victory  had been adjudged to Stephen Kiesslinger, born in the burg of Antwerp,  son of a wharfinger in that town.    When Nello recovered his consciousness he was lying on the stones  without, and Patrasche was trying with every art he knew to call him  back to life. In the distance a throng of the youths of Antwerp were  shouting around their successful comrade, and escorting him with  acclamations to his home upon the quay.    The boy staggered to his feet and drew the dog into his embrace. \"It is  all over, dear Patrasche,\" he murmured--\"all over!\"    He rallied himself as best he could, for he was weak from fasting, and  retraced his steps to the village. Patrasche paced by his side with his  head drooping and his old limbs feeble from hunger and sorrow.    The snow was falling fast; a keen hurricane blew from the north; it  was bitter as death on the plains. It took them long to traverse the  familiar path, and the bells were sounding four of the clock as they  approached the hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused, arrested by a scent in  the snow, scratched, whined, and drew out with his teeth a small case of  brown leather. He held it up to Nello in the darkness. Where they were  there stood a little Calvary, and a lamp burned dully under the cross;  the boy mechanically turned the case to the light; on it was the name of  Baas Cogez, and within it were notes for two thousand francs.    The sight roused the lad a little from his stupor. He thrust it in his  shirt, and stroked Patrasche and drew him onward. The dog looked up  wistfully in his face.    Nello made straight for the mill-house, and went to the house door and  struck on its panels. The miller's wife opened it weeping, with little  Alois clinging close to her skirts. \"Is it thee, thou poor lad?\" she  said kindly, through her tears. \"Get thee gone ere the Baas see thee.  We are in sore trouble to-night. He is out seeking for a power of money  that he has let fall riding homeward, and in this snow he never will  find it; and God knows it will go nigh to ruin us. It is Heaven's own  judgment for the things we have done to thee.\"    Nello put the note-case in her hand and called Patrasche within the  house. \"Patrasche found the money to-night,\" he said quickly. \"Tell Baas  Cogez so; I think he will not deny the dog shelter and food in his old  age. Keep him from pursuing me, and I pray of you to be good to him.\"    Ere either woman or dog knew what he meant he had stooped and kissed  Patrasche, then closed the door hurriedly, and disappeared in the gloom  of the fast-falling night.    The woman and the child stood speechless with joy and fear; Patrasche  vainly spent the fury of his anguish against the iron-bound oak of the  barred house door. They did not dare unbar the door and let him forth;  they tried all they could to solace him. They brought him sweet cakes  and juicy meats; they tempted him with the best they had; they tried to  lure him to abide by the warmth of the hearth; but it was of no avail.  Patrasche refused to be comforted or to stir from the barred portal.    It was six o'clock when from an opposite entrance the miller at last  came, jaded and broken, into his wife's presence. \"It is lost forever,\"  he said, with an ashen cheek and a quiver in his stern voice. \"We have  looked with lanterns everywhere; it is gone--the little maiden's portion  and all!\"    His wife put the money into his hand, and told him how it had come to  her. The strong man sank trembling into a seat and covered his face,  ashamed and almost afraid. \"I have been cruel to the lad,\" he muttered  at length; \"I deserved not to have good at his hands.\"    Little Alois, taking courage, crept close to her father and nestled  against him her fair curly head. \"Nello may come here again, father?\"  she whispered. \"He may come to-morrow as he used to do?\"    The miller pressed her in his arms; his hard, sunburnt face was very  pale and his mouth trembled. \"Surely, surely,\" he answered his child.  \"He shall bide here on Christmas Day, and any other day he will. God  helping me, I will make amends to the boy--I will make amends.\"    Little Alois kissed him in gratitude and joy; then slid from his knees  and ran to where the dog kept watch by the door. \"And to-night I may  feast Patrasche?\" she cried in a child's thoughtless glee.    Her father bent his head gravely: \"Ay, ay! let the dog have the best;\"  for the stern old man was moved and shaken to his heart's depths.    It was Christmas eve, and the mill-house was filled with oak logs and  squares of turf, with cream and honey, with meat and bread, and the  rafters were hung with wreaths of evergreen, and the Calvary and the  cuckoo clock looked out from a mass of holly. There were little paper  lanterns, too, for Alois, and toys of various fashions and sweetmeats  in bright-pictured papers. There were light and warmth and abundance  everywhere, and the child would fain have made the dog a guest honoured  and feasted.    But Patrasche would neither lie in the warmth nor share in the cheer.  Famished he was and very cold, but without Nello he would partake  neither of comfort nor food. Against all temptation he was proof, and  close against the door he leaned always, watching only for a means of  escape.    \"He wants the lad,\" said Baas Cogez. \"Good dog! good dog! I will go over  to the lad the first thing at day-dawn.\" For no one but Patrasche knew  that Nello had left the hut, and no one but Patrasche divined that Nello  had gone to face starvation and misery alone.    The mill kitchen was very warm; great logs crackled and flamed on the  hearth; neighbours came in for a glass of wine and a slice of the fat  goose baking for supper. Alois, gleeful and sure of her playmate back  on the morrow, bounded and sang and tossed back her yellow hair. Baas  Cogez, in the fulness of his heart, smiled on her through moistened  eyes, and spoke of the way in which he would befriend her favourite  companion; the house-mother sat with calm, contented face at the  spinning-wheel; the cuckoo in the clock chirped mirthful hours. Amidst  it all Patrasche was bidden with a thousand words of welcome to tarry  there a cherished guest. But neither peace nor plenty could allure him  where Nello was not.    When the supper smoked on the board, and the voices were loudest  and gladdest, and the Christ-child brought choicest gifts to Alois,  Patrasche, watching always an occasion, glided out when the door was  unlatched by a careless new-comer, and, as swiftly as his weak and tired  limbs would bear him sped over the snow in the bitter, black night. He  had only one thought--to follow Nello. A human friend might have paused  for the pleasant meal, the cheery warmth, the cosey slumber; but that  was not the friendship of Patrasche. He remembered a bygone time, when  an old man and a little child had found him sick unto death in the  wayside ditch.    Snow had fallen freshly all the evening long; it was now nearly ten; the  trail of the boy's footsteps was almost obliterated. It took Patrasche  long to discover any scent. When at last he found it, it was lost again  quickly, and lost and recovered, and again lost and again recovered, a  hundred times or more.    The night was very wild. The lamps under the wayside crosses were blown  out; the roads were sheets of ice; the impenetrable darkness hid every  trace of habitations; there was no living thing abroad. All the cattle  were housed, and in all the huts and homesteads men and women rejoiced  and feasted. There was only Patrasche out in the cruel cold--old and  famished and full of pain, but with the strength and the patience of a  great love to sustain him in his search.    The trail of Nello's steps, faint and obscure as it was under the new  snow, went straightly along the accustomed tracks into Antwerp. It was  past midnight when Patrasche traced it over the boundaries of the town  and into the narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets. It was all quite dark in  the town, save where some light gleamed ruddily through the crevices  of house shutters, or some group went homeward with lanterns chanting  drinking-songs. The streets were all white with ice; the high walls and  roofs loomed black against them."]]]
