S.    Maitreya, take the necklace and go to Vasantasena. Tell her in  my name that we have gambled away the golden casket, forgetting  that it was not our own, that we trust she will accept this  necklace in its place.    _Maitreya._ But you must not give away this necklace, the pride of  the four seas, for that cheap thing that was stolen before we had  a bite or a drink out of it.    _Charudatta._ Not so, my friend.        She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;      The price of confidence has no less measure.                 29    Friend, I conjure you by this gesture, not to return until you have  delivered it into her hands. Vardhamanaka, do you speedily        Fill up the opening with the selfsame bricks;        Thus will I thwart the process of the law,      For the blemish of so great a scandal sticks.                30    And, friend Maitreya, you must show your pride by not speaking  too despondently.    _Maitreya._ How can a poor man help speaking despondently?    _Charudatta._ Poor I am not, my friend. For I have a wife        Whose love outlasts my wealthy day;        In thee a friend through good and ill;      And truth that naught could take away:        Ah, this the poor man lacketh still.

Here is my mistress. She is gazing at a picture and is talking  with Madanika. I will go to her. [_She walks about. Then enter  Vasantasena as described, and Madanika._]    _Vasantasena._ Madanika girl, is this portrait really like Charudatta?    _Madanika._ Very like.    _Vasantasena._ How do you know?    _Madanika._ Because my mistress' eyes are fastened so lovingly  upon it.    _Vasantasena._ Madanika girl, do you say this because courtezan  courtesy demands it?    _Madanika._ But mistress, is the courtesy of a girl who lives in a  courtezan's house, necessarily false?    _Vasantasena._ Girl, courtezans meet so many kinds of men that  they do learn a false courtesy.    _Madanika._ But when the eyes of my mistress find such delight in  a thing, and her heart too, what need is there to ask the reason?    _Vasantasena._ But I should not like to have my friends laugh at me.    _Madanika._ You need not be afraid. Women understand women.    _Maid._ [_Approaching._] Mistress, your mother sends word that a  covered cart is waiting at the side-door, and that you are to take  a drive.    _Vasantasena._ Tell me, is it Charudatta who invites me?    _Maid._ Mistress, the man who sent ornaments worth ten thousand  gold-pieces with the cart--    [58.6. S.    _Vasantasena._ Is who?    _Maid._ Is the king's brother-in-law, Sansthanaka.    _Vasantasena._ [_Indignantly._] Go! and never come again on such  an errand.    _Maid._ Do not be angry, mistress. I was only sent with the message.    _Vasantasena._ But it is the message which makes me angry.    _Maid._ But what shall I tell your mother?    _Vasantasena._ Tell my mother never to send me another such  message, unless she wishes to kill me.    _Maid._ As you will. [_Exit._]       [_<Enter Sharvilaka._]    _Sharv._        Blame for my sin I laid upon the night;        I conquered sleep and watchmen of the king;      But darkness wanes, and in the sun's clear light        My light is like the moon's--a faded thing.                1    And again:        Whoever cast at me a passing look,        Or neared me, anxious, as they quickly ran,      All such my laden soul for foes mistook;        For sin it was wherein man's fear began.                   2    Well, it was for Madanika's sake that I did the deed of sin.        I paid no heed to any one who talked with serving-men;        The houses ruled by women-folk--these I avoided most;      And when policemen seemed to have me almost in their ken,        I stood stock-still and acted just exactly like a post.      A hundred such manoeuvres did I constantly essay,      And by such means succeeded in turning night to day.         3    [_He walks about._]    _Vasantasena._ Girl, lay this picture on my sofa and come back at  once with a fan.    _Madanika._ Yes, mistress.               [_Exit with the picture._    _Sharvilaka._ This is Vasantasena's house. I will enter. [_He does so._]    P. 101.11]    I wonder where I can find Madanika. [_Enter Madanika with the  fan. Sharvilaka discovers her._] Ah, it is Madanika.        Surpassing Madana[50] himself in charm,        She seems the bride of Love, in human guise;      Even while my heart the flames of passion harm,        She brings a sandal[51] coolness to my eyes.               4    Madanika!    _Madanika._ [_Discovers Sharvilaka._] Oh, oh, oh, Sharvilaka! I am so  glad, Sharvilaka. Where have you been?    _Sharvilaka._ I will tell you. [_They gaze at each other passionately._]    _Vasantasena._ How Madanika lingers! I wonder where she is. [_She  looks through a bull's-eye window._] Why, there she stands, talking  with a man. Her loving glance does not waver, and she gazes as  if she would drink him in. I imagine he must be the man who  wishes to make her free. Well, let her stay, let her stay. Never interrupt  anybody's happiness. I will not call her.    _Madanika._ Tell me, Sharvilaka. [_Sharvilaka looks about him uneasily._]  What is it, Sharvilaka? You seem uneasy.    _Sharvilaka._ I will tell you a secret. Are we alone?    _Madanika._ Of course we are.    _Vasantasena._ What! a deep secret? I will not listen.    _Sharvilaka._ Tell me, Madanika. Will Vasantasena take a price for  your freedom?    _Vasantasena._ The conversation has to do with me? Then I will  hide behind this window and listen.    _Madanika._ I asked my mistress about it, Sharvilaka, and she said  that if she could have _her_ way, she would free all her servants for  nothing. But Sharvilaka, where did you find such a fortune that  you can think of buying my freedom from my mistress?    _Sharvilaka._        A victim to my pauper plight,        And your sweet love to win,      For you, my timid maid, last night        I did the deed of sin.                                     5    [60.16. S.    _Vasantasena._ His face is tranquil. It would be troubled, if he had  sinned.    _Madanika._ Oh, Sharvilaka! For a mere nothing--for a woman--you  have risked both things!    _Sharvilaka._ What things?    _Madanika._ Your life and your character.    _Sharvilaka._ My foolish girl, fortune favors the brave.    _Madanika._ Oh, Sharvilaka! Your character was without a stain.  You didn't do anything _very_ bad, did you, when for my sake you  did the deed of sin?    _Sharv._        The gems that magnify a woman's charm,      As flowers the creeping plant, I do not harm.      I do not rob the Brahman of his pelf,      Nor seize the sacrificial gold myself.      I do not steal the baby from the nurse,      Simply because I need to fill my purse.      Even as a thief, I strive with main and might      For just distinction 'twixt the wrong and right.             6    And so you may tell Vasantasena this:        These ornaments were made for you to don,        Or so it seems to me;      But as you love me, never put them on        Where other folks may see.                                 7    _Madanika._ But Sharvilaka, ornaments that nobody may see, and  a courtezan--the two things do not hang together. Give me the  jewels. I want to see them.    _Sharvilaka._ Here they are. [_He gives them to her with some uneasiness._]    _Madanika._ [_Examining the jewels._] It seems to me I have seen  these before. Tell me. Where did you get them?    P. 104.15]    _Sharvilaka._ What does that matter to you, Madanika? Take them.    _Madanika._ [_Angrily._] If you can't trust me, why do you wish to  buy my freedom?    _Sharvilaka._ Well, this morning I heard in the merchants' quarter  that the merchant Charudatta--    [_Vasantasena and Madanika swoon._]    _Sharvilaka._ Madanika! Come to yourself! Why is it that now        Your figure seems to melt in limp despair,      Your eyes are wildly rolling here and there?      That when I come, sweet girl, to make you free,      You fall to trembling, not to pitying me?                    8    _Madanika._ [_Coming to herself._] O you reckless man! When you  did what you ought not to have done for my sake, you didn't kill  anybody or hurt anybody in that house?    _Sharvilaka._ Madanika, Sharvilaka does not strike a terrified man  or a man asleep. I did not kill anybody nor hurt anybody.    _Madanika._ Really?    _Sharvilaka._ Really.    _Vasantasena._ [_Recovering consciousness._] Ah, I breathe again.    _Madanika._ Thank heaven!    _Sharvilaka._ [_Jealously._] What does this \"Thank heaven\" mean,  Madanika?        I sinned for you, when love had made me pine,        Although my house was good since time began;      Love took my virtue, but my pride is mine.        _You_ call me friend and love another man?                 9    [_Meaningly._]        A noble youth is like a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],[0,"The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#14)"],[1," other hands.  He took to himself whatever blame he  could, and dwelt as little as possible on the plot that had been laid to  get him to Gurley, and on the means which had been used to keep him when  once there.  He finished up with a very warm and pathetic appeal for Tom  Drift.    \"Don't, please, expel Tom Drift,\" he said, in all the boldness of  generosity; \"he was led on by the others, sir, and he's punished badly  enough as it is.  Oh! sir, if you'd seen his mother cry, when she only  spoke of him, you couldn't do it.\"    \"You must leave that to me,\" said the doctor sternly, \"I hope I shall do  nothing that is unjust or unkind.  And now go to bed, and thank God for  the care He has taken of you to-day.\"    And Charlie went.    Tom Drift was not expelled.  For weeks he lay ill, and during that time  no nurse was more devoted, and no companion more constant, than Charlie  Newcome.  A friendship sprang up between the two, strangely in contrast  with the old footing on which they had stood.  No longer was Tom the  vain, hectoring patron, but the docile penitent, over whose spirit  Charlie's character began from that time to exercise an influence which,  if in the time to come it could always have worked as it did now, would  have gone far to save Tom Drift from many a bitter fall and experience.    When Tom, a week before the Christmas holidays, left the sick-room and  took his place once more in his class, Gus, Margetson, and Shadbolt were  no longer inmates of Randlebury School.        CHAPTER TEN.    HOW I CHANGED HANDS AND QUITTED RANDLEBURY.    And now, dear reader, we must take a leap together of three years.  For  remember, I am not setting myself to record the life of any one person,  or the events which happened at any one place.  I am writing my own  life--or those parts of it which are most memorable--and therefore it  behoves me not to dwell unduly on times and scenes in which I was not  personally interested.    I had a very close connection with the events that rendered Charlie's  first term at school so exciting, but after that, for three years, I  pursued the even tenor of my way, performing some twenty-six thousand  two hundred and eighty revolutions, unmarked by any incident, either in  my own life or that of my master worthy of notice.    By the end of those three years, however, things were greatly changed at  Randlebury.  Charlie, not far from his sixteenth birthday, was now a  tall, broad-shouldered fellow, lording it in the Upper Fifth, and the  hero of the cricket field of which he himself had once been a cadet.  In  face he was not greatly altered.  Still the old curly head and bright  eyes.  He _was_ noticed occasionally to stroke his chin abstractedly;  and some envious detractors went so far as to rumour that, in the lowest  recesses of his trunk he had a razor, wherewith on divers occasions, in  dread secret, he operated with slashing effect.  Be this as it might,  Charlie was growing up.  He had a fag of his own, who alternately quaked  and rejoiced beneath his eye; he wore a fearful and wonderful stick-up  collar on Sundays, and, above all, he treated me with a careless  indifference which contrasted wonderfully with his former enthusiasm,  and betokened only too significantly the advance of years on his young  head.    True, he wound me up regularly; but he often left me half the day under  his pillow; and though once in a fit of artistic zeal he set himself to  hew out a C.N. in startling characters on my back, with the point of a  bodkin, he never polished me now as he was once wont to do.    All this was painful to me, especially the operation with the bodkin,  but I still rejoiced to call him master, and to know that though years  had changed his looks, and sobered his childish exuberance, the same  true heart still beat close to mine, and remained still as warm and  guileless as when little Charlie Newcome, with me in his pocket, first  put his foot forth into the world.    There were two besides myself who could bear witness at the end of these  three years that time had not changed the boy's heart.  These two, I  need hardly say, were Tom Drift and Jim Halliday.    To Tom, Charlie had become increasingly a friend of the true kind.  Ever  since the day at Gurley races, the influence of the younger boy had  grown and overshadowed the elder, confirming his unstable resolutions,  animating his sluggish mind with worthy ambitions, and giving to his  pliant character a tone coloured by his own honesty and uprightness.  Just as a pilot will safely steer the ship amid shoals and rocks out  into the deeper waters, so Charlie, by his quiet influence, had given  Tom's life a new direction towards honour and usefulness.    Once, and once only, during those three years had he shown a disposition  to hark back on his old discreditable ways, and that was the result of a  casual meeting with Gus one summer during the holidays, with whom, he  afterwards confessed to Charlie, he was induced to forget for a time his  better resolutions in the snares of a billiard-room.  But the  backsliding was repented of almost as soon as committed, and, to  Charlie's anxious eyes, appeared to leave behind no bad result.    Jim was the same downright outspoken boy as ever.  He had yielded,  surlily at first, to the admission of Tom Drift into the confidence and  friendship of himself and his chum, but by degrees, moved by Charlie's  example, he had become more hearty, and now these three boys were the  firmest friends in Randlebury.    One day, as Charlie was sitting in his study attempting, with many  groans, to make sense out of a very obscure passage in Cicero, his fag  entered and said,--    \"Newcome, there's a parcel for you down at Trotter's.\"    \"Why didn't you bring it up, you young muff?\" inquired his lord.    \"Because it's got to be signed for, and he wouldn't let me do that for  you.\"    \"Like your cheek to think of such a thing.  What's it like?\"    \"Oh, it's in a little box.  I say, Newcome, shall we go and get it?\"    \"I can't go at present; it'll wait, I suppose,\" said Charlie, with the  air of a man who was daily in the habit of receiving little boxes by the  carrier.    But for all that he could not wholly conceal his curiosity.    \"What size box?\" he asked presently.    \"About the size of a good big pill-box.\"    \"All that?  I dare say I can fetch that up by myself,\" said Charlie.    Size of a large pill-box!  It could not be anything so very important  after all.  So he turned again to his Cicero, and sent the fag about his  business.    Presently, however, that youth returned with a letter for Charlie.  It  ran thus:      \"Dear Young Scamp,      \"People always say bachelor uncles are fools, and I think they are    right.  I've sent you a proof of my folly in a little box, which ought    to reach you about the same time as this letter.  You've done nothing    to deserve a present from me, and a box on the ears would be much    better bestowed.  Never mind.  Take care of this little gift for me,    in memory of the jolly Christmas you and I last spent together, and    when you are not kicking up a row with your cronies at Randlebury or    have nothing better to do, think of your affectionate      \"Uncle Ralph.\"    Much to the fag's astonishment, Charlie, having perused this letter,  slammed up Cicero, and seizing the cap from off his (the fag's) head, as  being most ready to hand, dashed out of school in the direction of the  village.    \"Trot!\" he exclaimed, as he reached the establishment of that familiar  merchant, \"hand up that little box, you old villain!  Do you hear?\"    The long-suffering Trotter, to whom this address was comparatively  polite in its phraseology, was not long in producing the parcel, in  acknowledgment of which Charlie gave his sign manual in lordly  characters upon the receipt; and then, burning with impatience, yet  trying hard to appear unconcerned, walked swiftly back to the school.    The fag was hanging about his study, scarcely less curious than himself.    \"Hook it!\" cried his master, putting the parcel down on the table and  taking out his penknife to cut the string.    Still the inquisitive fag lingered.  Whereupon Charlie, taking him  kindly yet firmly by the collar of his coat, conveyed him to the open  window, whence he gently dropped him a distance of six feet to the  earth.    Privacy being thus secured, he turned again to his parcel and opened it.  Imagine his delight and my agony when there came to light a splendid  gold watch and chain!  I turned faint with jealousy, and when a second  glance showed me that the interloper was no other than the identical  gold repeater whom I had known and dreaded in my infancy, I was ready to  break my mainspring with vexation.  To me the surprise had brought  nothing but foreboding and despair, and already I felt myself discarded  for my rival; but to Charlie it brought a rapture of delight which  expressed itself in a whoop which could be heard half over the school.    \"What on earth's the row?\" said a head looking in at the door; \"caught  cold, or what?\"    \"Come here, Jim, this moment; look at this!\"    And Jim came and looked, and as he looked his eyes sparkled with  admiration.    \"My eye, Charlie, what a beauty!\" said he, taking up the treasure in his  hand.  His thumb happened to touch the spring on the handle, and  instantly there came a low melodious note from inside the repeater--One,  two, three, and then a double tinkle twice repeated.    \"That's striking,\" observed Jim, who was occasionally guilty of a pun.  \"Why, it's a repeater!\"    \"So it is!  Did you ever know such a brick as that uncle of mine?\"    \"It's a pity your people can't think of anything else but watches for  presents.  Why, what a donkey you made of yourself about that silver  turnip when you first had it!  Don't you remember?  What's to become of  it, by the by?\"    \"How do I know?  I say, Jim, this one wasn't got for nothing.\"  "]]]
