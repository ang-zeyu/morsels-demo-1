Also when I am going home?\" Heidi inquired, confused with  joy.    \"Certainly, forever!\" the grandmama assured her. \"Tomorrow we shall  begin to read it.\"    \"But Heidi, you must not go home; no, not for many years,\" Clara  exclaimed, \"especially when grandmama goes away. You must stay with  me.\"    Heidi still looked at her book before going to bed that night, and  this book became her dearest treasure. She would look at the beautiful  pictures and read all the stories aloud to Clara. Grandmama would  quietly listen and explain something here and there, making it more  beautiful than before. Heidi loved the pictures with the shepherd best  of all; they told the story of the prodigal son, and the child would  read and re-read it till she nearly knew it all by heart. Since Heidi  had learned to read and possessed the book, the days seemed to fly,  and the time had come near that the grandmama had fixed for her  departure.          XI    HEIDI GAINS IN SOME RESPECTS AND LOSES IN OTHERS      The grandmama sent for Heidi every day after dinner, while Clara was  resting and Miss Rottenmeier disappeared into her room. She talked to  Heidi and amused her in various ways, showing her how to make clothes  for pretty little dolls that she had brought. Unconsciously Heidi had  learned to sew, and made now the sweetest dresses and coats for the  little people out of lovely materials the grandmama would give her.  Often Heidi would read to the old lady, for the oftener she read over  the stories the dearer they became to her. The child lived everything  through with the people in the tales and was always happy to be with  them again. But she never looked really cheerful and her eyes never  sparkled merrily as before.    In the last week of Mrs. Sesemann's stay, Heidi was called again to  the old lady's room. The child entered with her beloved book under her  arm. Mrs. Sesemann drew Heidi close to her, and laying the book aside,  she said: \"Come, child, and tell me why you are so sad. Do you still  have the same sorrow?\"    \"Yes,\" Heidi replied.    \"Did you confide it to Our Lord?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you pray to Him every day that He may make you happy again and  take your affliction away?\"    \"Oh no, I don't pray any more.\"    \"What do I hear, Heidi? Why don't you pray?\"    \"It does not help, for God has not listened. I don't wonder,\" she  added, \"for if all the people in Frankfurt pray every night, He cannot  listen to them all. I am sure He has not heard me.\"    \"Really? Why are you so sure?\"    \"Because I have prayed for the same thing many, many weeks and God has  not done what I have asked Him to.\"    \"That is not the way, Heidi. You see, God in heaven is a good Father  to all of us, who knows what we need better than we do. When something  we ask for is not very good for us, He gives us something much better,  if we confide in Him and do not lose confidence in His love. I am sure  what you asked for was not very good for you just now; He has heard  you, for He can hear the prayers of all the people in the world at the  same time, because He is God Almighty and not a mortal like us. He  heard your prayers and said to Himself: 'Yes, Heidi shall get what she  is praying for in time.' Now, while God was looking down on you to  hear your prayers, you lost confidence and went away from Him. If God  does not hear your prayers any more, He will forget you also and let  you go. Don't you want to go back to Him, Heidi, and ask His  forgiveness? Pray to Him every day, and hope in Him, that He may bring  cheer and happiness to you.\"    Heidi had listened attentively; she had unbounded confidence in the  old lady, whose words had made a deep impression on her. Full of  repentance, she said: \"I shall go at once and ask Our Father to pardon  me. I shall never forget Him any more!\"    \"That's right, Heidi; I am sure He will help you in time, if you only  trust in Him,\" the grandmother consoled her. Heidi went to her room  now and prayed earnestly to God that He would forgive her and fulfill  her wish.    The day of departure had come, but Mrs. Sesemann arranged everything  in such a way that the children hardly realized she was actually  going. Still everything was empty and quiet when she had gone, and the  children hardly knew how to pass their time.    Next day, Heidi came to Clara in the afternoon and said: \"Can I  always, always read to you now, Clara?\"    Clara assented, and Heidi began. But she did not get very far, for the  story she was reading told of a grandmother's death. Suddenly she  cried aloud: \"Oh, now grandmother is dead!\" and wept in the most  pitiful fashion. Whatever Heidi read always seemed real to her, and  now she thought it was her own grandmother at home. Louder and louder  she sobbed: \"Now poor grandmother is dead and I can never see her any  more; and she never got one single roll!\"    Clara attempted to explain the mistake, but Heidi was too much upset.  She pictured to herself how terrible it would be if her dear old  grandfather would die too while she was far away. How quiet and empty  it would be in the hut, and how lonely she would be!    Miss Rottenmeier had overheard the scene, and approaching the sobbing  child she said impatiently: \"Adelheid, now you have screamed enough.  If I hear you again giving way to yourself in such a noisy fashion, I  shall take your book away forever!\"    Heidi turned pale at that, for the book was her greatest treasure.  Quickly drying her tears, she choked down her sobs. After that Heidi  never cried again; often she could hardly repress her sobs and was  obliged to make the strangest faces to keep herself from crying out.  Clara often looked at her, full of surprise, but Miss Rottenmeier did  not notice them and found no occasion to carry out her threat.  However, the poor child got more cheerless every day, and looked so  thin and pale that Sebastian became worried. He tried to encourage her  at table to help herself to all the good dishes, but listlessly she  would let them pass and hardly touch them. In the evening she would  cry quietly, her heart bursting with longing to go home.    Thus the time passed by. Heidi never knew if it was summer or winter,  for the walls opposite never changed. They drove out very seldom, for  Clara was only able to go a short distance. They never saw anything  else than streets, houses and busy people; no grass, no fir-trees and  no mountains. Heidi struggled constantly against her sorrow, but in  vain. Autumn and winter had passed, and Heidi knew that the time was  coming when Peter would go up the Alp with his goats, where the  flowers were glistening in the sunshine and the mountains were all  afire. She would sit down in a corner of her room and put both hands  before her eyes, not to see the glaring sunshine on the opposite wall.  There she would remain, eating her heart away with longing, till Clara  would call for her to come.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: THERE SHE WOULD REMAIN, EATING HER HEART AWAY WITH  LONGING]          XII    THE SESEMANN HOUSE IS HAUNTED      For several days Miss Rottenmeier had been wandering silently about  the house. When she went from room to room or along the corridors, she  would often glance back as if she were afraid that somebody was  following her. If she had to go to the upper floor, where the gorgeous  guest-rooms were, or to the lower story, where the big ball-room was  situated, she always told Tinette to come with her. The strange thing  was, that none of the servants dared to go anywhere alone and always  found an excuse to ask each other's company, which requests were  always granted. The cook, who had been in the house for many years,  would often shake her head and mutter: \"That I should live to see  this!\"    Something strange and weird was happening in the house. Every  morning, when the servants came down-stairs, they found the front door  wide open. At first everybody had thought that the house must have  been robbed, but nothing was missing. Every morning it was the same,  despite the double locks that were put on the door. At last John and  Sebastian, taking courage, prepared themselves to watch through a  night to see who was the ghost. Armed and provided with some  strengthening liquor, they repaired to a room down-stairs. First they  talked, but soon, getting sleepy, they leaned silently back in their  chairs. When the clock from the old church tower struck one, Sebastian  awoke and roused his comrade, which was no easy matter. At last,  however, John was wide awake, and together they went out into the  hall. The same moment a strong wind put out the light that John held  in his hand. Rushing back, he nearly upset Sebastian, who stood behind  him, and pulling the butler back into the room, he locked the door in  furious haste. When the light was lit again, Sebastian noticed that  John was deadly pale and trembling like an aspen leaf. Sebastian, not  having seen anything, asked anxiously: \"What is the matter? What did  you see?\"    \"The door was open and a white form was on the stairs; it went up and  was gone in a moment,\" gasped John. Cold shivers ran down the butler's  back. They sat without moving till the morning came, and then,  shutting the door, they went upstairs to report to the housekeeper  what they had seen. The lady, who was waiting eagerly, heard the tale  and immediately sat down to write to Mr. Sesemann. She told him that  fright had paralyzed her fingers and that terrible things were  happening in the house. Then followed a tale of the appearance of the  ghost. Mr. Sesemann replied that he could not leave his business, and  advised Miss Rottenmeier to ask his mother to come to stay with them,  for Mrs. Sesemann would easily despatch the ghost. Miss Rottenmeier  was offended with the tone of the letter, which did not seem to take  her account seriously. Mrs. Sesemann also replied that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#14)"],[1,"then.    The overseer on our place was a large tall, black man. We had plenty  poor white neighbors. They was one of our biggest troubles. They'd  allus look in our window and door all the time.    I saw slaves sold. I can see that old block now. My cousin Eliza was a  pretty girl, really good looking. Her master was her father. When the  girls in the big house had beaux coming to see 'em, they'd ask, \"Who  is that pretty gal?\" So they decided to git rid of her right away. The  day they sold her will allus be remembered. They stripped her to be  bid off and looked at. I wasn't allowed to stand in the crowd. I was  laying down under a fig brush. The man that bought Eliza was from New  York. The Negroes had made up nuff money to buy her off theyself, but  they wouldn't let that happen. There was a man bidding for her who was  a Swedeland. He allus bid for the good looking cullud gals and bought  'em for his own use. He ask the man from New York, \"Whut you gonna do  with her when you git 'er?\" The man from New York said, \"None of your  damn business, but you ain't got money nuff to buy 'er.\" When the man  from New York had done bought her, he said, \"Eliza, you are free from  now on.\" She left and went to New York with him. Mama and Eliza both  cried when she was being showed off, and master told 'em to shet up  before he knocked they brains out.    Iffen you didn't do nothing wrong, they whipped you now and then  anyhow. I called a boy Johnny once and he took me 'hind the garden and  poured it on me and made me call him master. It was from then on I  started to fear the white man. I come to think of him as a bear.  Sometimes fellows would be a little late making it in and they got  whipped with a cow-hide. The same man whut whipped me to make me call  him master, well, he whipped my mamma. He tied her to a tree and beat  her unmerciful and cut her tender parts. I don't know why he tied her  to that tree.    The first time you was caught trying to read or write, you was whipped  with a cow-hide, the next time with a cat-o-nine tails and the third  time they cut the first jint offen your forefinger. They was very  severe. You most allus got 30 and 9 lashes.    They carried news from one plantation by whut they call relay. Iffen  you was caught, they whipped you till you said, \"Oh, pray Master!\" One  day a man gitting whipped was saying \"Oh pray master, Lord have  mercy!\" They'd say \"Keep whipping that nigger Goddamn him.\" He was  whipped till he said, \"Oh pray Master, I gotta nuff.\" Then they said,  \"Let him up now, 'cause he's praying to the right man.\"    My father was the preacher and an educated man. You know the sermon  they give him to preach?--Servant, Obey Your Master. Our favorite  baptizing hymn was On Jordan's Stormy Bank I Stand. My favorite song  is Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen.    Oh, them patrollers! They had a chief and he git'em together and iffen  they caught you without a pass and sometimes with a pass, they'd beat  you. But iffen you had a pass, they had to answer to the law. One old  master had two slaves, brothers, on his place. They was both  preachers. Mitchell was a hardshell Baptist and Andrew was a  Missionary Baptist. One day the patroller chief was rambling thoo' the  place and found some letters writ to Mitchell and Andrew. He went to  the master and said, \"Did you know you had some niggers that could  read and write?\" Master said, \"No, but I might have, who do you  'spect?\" The patroller answered, \"Mitchell and Andrew.\" The old master  said, \"I never knowed Andrew to tell me a lie 'bout nothing!\"    Mitchell was called first and asked could he read and write. He was  scared stiff. He said, \"Naw-sir.\" Andrew was called and asked. He  said, \"Yes-sir.\" He was asked iffen Mitchell could. He said, \"Sho',  better'n me.\" The master told John Arnold, the patroller chief, not to  bother 'em. He gloried in they spunk. When the old master died, he  left all of his niggers a home apiece. We had Ku Klux Klans till the  government sent Federal officers out and put a stop to their ravaging  and sent 'em to Sing Sing.    Doing the war my father was carpenter. His young master come to him  'cause he was a preacher and asked him must he go to the front and my  father told him not to go 'cause he wouldn't make it. He went on jest  the same and when he come back my father had to tote him in the house  'cause he had one leg tore off. The Yankees come thoo', ramshacked  houses, leave poor horses and take fat ones and turn the poor ones in  the corn they left. They took everthing they could. They cussed  niggers who dodged 'em for being fools and make 'em show 'em  everything they knowed whar was.    Our old master was mighty old and him and the women folks cried when  we was freed. He told us we was free as he was.    I come to Oklahoma in 1906. I come out of that riot in 1906. Some  fellow knocked up a colored woman or something and we waded right in  and believe me we made Atlanta a fit place to live in. It is one of  the best cities in America.    I married Miss Emmaline Witt. I carried her to the preacher one of the  coldest nights I ever rid. I have three chillun and don't know how  many grandchillun. My chillun is one a nurse, one in Arizona for his  health and the other doing first one thing and another.    I think Abraham Lincoln was the greatest human being ever been on  earth 'cepting the Apostle Paul. Who any better'n a man who liberated  4,000,000 Negroes? Some said he wasn't a Christian, but he told some  friends once, \"I'm going to leave you and may never see you again (and  he didn't) so I'm going to take the Divine Spirit with me and leave it  with you.\"    Jeff Davis was as bloody as he could be. I don't lak him a'tall. But  you know good things come from enemies. I don't even admire George  Washington. White men from the south that will help the Negro is far  and few between. Booker T. Washington was a great man. He made some  blunders and mistakes, but he was a great man. He is the father of  industrial education and you know that sho' is a great thing.    The white folks was ignorant. You know the better you prepare yourself  the better you act. Iffen they had put some sense in our heads 'stead  of sticks on our heads, we'ud been better off and more benefit to 'em.    I had something from within that made me fear God and taught me how to  pray. People say God don't hear sinners pray, but he do. Everybody  ought to be Christians so not to be lost.    I work in real estate and can do a lot of work. I don't use no  crutches and no cane and walk all the time, never hardly ride. I come  in at 1 and 2 o'clock a. m. and get up between 8 and 9 a. m. 'cept  Sundays, I get up at 7 or 8 a. m. so I can be ready to go to Sunday  School. I cook for my own self all the time too. I am a Baptist and a  member of Tabernacle Baptist Church. I am a trustee in my church too.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves  [Date stamp: AUG 19 1937]    JOANNA DRAPER  Age 83 yrs.  Tulsa, Okla.      Most folks can't remember many things happened to 'em when they only  eight years old, but one of my biggest tribulations come about dat  time and I never will forget it! That was when I was took away from my  own mammy and pappy and sent off and bound out to another man, way off  two-three hundred miles away from whar I live. And dat's the last time  I ever see either one of them, or any my own kinfolks!    Whar I was born was at Hazelhurst, Mississippi. Jest a little piece  east of Hazelhurst, close to the Pearl River, and that place was a  kind of new plantation what my Master, Dr. Alexander, bought when he  moved into Mississippi from up in Virginia awhile before the War.    They said my mammy brings me down to Mississippi, and I was born jest  right after she got there. My mammy's name was Margaret, and she was  born under the Ramson's, back in Tennessee. She belonged to Dave  Ramson, and his pappy had come to Tennessee to settle on war land, and  he had knowed Dr. Alexander's people back in Virginia too. My pappy's  name was Addison, and he always belonged to Dr. Alexander. Old doctor  bought my mammy 'cause my pappy liked her. Old doctor live in  Tennessee a little while before he go on down in Mississippi.    Old doctor's wife named Dinah, and she sho' was a good woman, but I  don't remember about old doctor much. He was away all the time, it  seem like.    When I is about six year old they take me into the Big House to learn  to be a house woman, and they show me how to cook and clean up and  take care of babies. That Big House wasn't very fine, but it was  mighty big and cool, and made out of logs with a big hall, but it  didn't have no long gallery like most the houses around there had.    They was lots of big trees in the yard, and most the ground was new  ground 'round that place, 'cause the old Doctor jest started to done  farming on it when I was took away, but he had some more places not so  far away, over towards the river that was old ground and made big  crops for him. I went to one of the places one time, but they wasn't  nobody on 'em but niggers and a white overseer. I don't know how many  niggers old Doctor had, but Master John Deeson say he had about a  hundred.    At old Doctor's house I didn't have to work very hard. Jest had to  help the cooks and peel the potatoes and pick the guineas and chickens  and do things like that. Sometime I had to watch the baby. He was a  little boy, and they would bring him into the kitchen for me to watch.  I had to git up way before daylight and make the fire in the kitchen  fireplace and bring in some fresh water, and go get the milk what been  down in the spring all night, and do things like that until breakfast  ready. Old Master and old Mistress come in the big hall to eat in the  summer, and I stand behind them and shoo off the flies.    Old doctor didn't have no spinning and weaving niggers 'cause he say  they don't do enough work and he buy all "]]]
