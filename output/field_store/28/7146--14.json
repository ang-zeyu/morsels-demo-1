[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#14)"],[1,"3), which may be placed horizontally in any part of the  field except in fesse or at the chief of the Shield, is about one-fifth  of the field (or sometimes less) in depth. A single bar very rarely  occurs in blazon. Examples:--_Or, two bars gu._,--for DE HARECOURT, No.  81: _Az., two bars dancettée or_,--for DE RIVERES: _Or, two bars gu., in  chief three torteaux_,--for WAKE, No. 82. The Diminutive of the Bar is  the _Barrulet_, one-half of its width. When they are disposed in  couples, Barrulets are _Bars Gemelles_, these not being so deep as the  barrulet: thus, No. 83,--for DE HUNTERCUMBE,--_Erm., two bars gemelles  gu._ (H. 3). A Fesse or Bar, when placed between two similar figures  narrower than barrulets, is said to be _cotised_ by them; or, to be  \"doubly cotised,\" when placed between two bars gemelles: thus, for DE LA  MERE, No. 84,--_Or, a fesse doubly cotised_ (or, _between two bars  gemelles_) _az._ (E. 2). An _even_ number of bars alternately of a metal  (or a fur) and a colour form the varied field which is to be blazoned  \"_barry_,\" the number of the bars in every case to be specified--as,  \"_barry of six_,\" \"_barry of eight_,\" &c. If the number of bars exceeds  _eight_ (some writers say _ten_), it is \"_barrulée_\" or \"_barruly_\"; and  in this case it is not necessary that the number of the bars should be  specified, the word _barrulée_ being used alone, or the expression  \"_barrulée sans nombre_\" to denote a considerable number, but not a  fixed number of bars--the number, however, always to be _even_. But this  is a modern refinement of blazon to which little if any attention was  paid in early days. It is to be observed that while the bars, whatever  their number, if they are blazoned as bars, are to be treated as if they  were executed in relief upon the field of a Shield, a Shield that is  barry or barrulée has its field formed by bars which are all in the same  plane. Examples:--_Barry of six or and gu._, for FITZ ALAN of Bedale,  No. 85: _Barry of six arg. and az._, for DE GREY: _Barry of eight or and  az._,--for DE PENBRUGGE (all H. 3): _Barrulée arg. and az., an orle of  martlets gu._,--for DE VALENCE, Earl of PEMBROKE, No. 86; in this  example _ten_ bars are represented, but in the noble enamelled shield of  the first De Valence (A.D. 1296) preserved in Westminster Abbey, the  bars are _twenty-eight_ in number. Charges, not \"in fesse\" or \"in  chief,\" that are disposed horizontally across the field are  \"_bar-wise_.\"      [Illustration: No. 85.--Fitzalan of Bedale.]      [Illustration: No. 86.--De Valence.]      [Illustration: No. 87.--Erskine.]      [Illustration: No. 88.--Grandison.]    THE PALE.--Like the Fesse, this Ordinary occupies rather less than a  central third of the field, but it is _vertical_ in its position instead  of horizontal. No. 87, for ERSKINE, is--_Arg., a pale sa._ Its  Diminutives, the _Pallet_ and the _Endorse_, severally one-half and  one-fourth of its width, may be placed vertically in any part of the  field. A Pale between two Endorses is \"_endorsed_\" but the term  _cotised_ is also employed with this meaning. An _even_ number of  Pallets of a metal (or a fur) and a colour set alternately, form the  varied field to be blazoned \"_paly_,\" the number of the Pallets (which  lie all in the same plane) always to be specified: thus--_Paly of six  arg. and az., on a bend gu. three eaglets displayed or_, for GRANDISON,  No. 88 (H. 3) Charges that are disposed one above another in a vertical  row are \"in pale.\" This is the arrangement of the three golden lions of  England.    The CROSS (H. 3), formed from a combination of a Fesse with a Pale, in  its simplest form is set erect in the centre of the field, and it  extends to the border-lines of the Shield. If at any time it may be  necessary or apparently desirable specially to set forth in the  blazoning of a Shield, that a Cross charged upon it does thus extend to  the border-lines, such a Cross is blazoned as a \"_Cross throughout_.\"  No. 1, _Arg., a Cross gu._, the armorial ensign of ST. GEORGE, the  special Patron Saint of England, may be blazoned as \"_A Cross of St.  George_.\" Of this Cross, the great symbol of the Christian Faith,  Spenser says--      \"And on his brest a bloodie Cross he bore,    The deare remembrance of his dying Lord....    Upon his Shield the like was also scored.\"      _Faerie Queen_, I. i. 2.      [Illustration: No. 89.--Cross fimbriated.]      [Illustration: No. 90.--Cross pointed.]    A Cross having a narrow border lying in the same plane with itself, is  \"fimbriated,\" such a border being a \"_fimbriation_\": thus, No. 89, _Az.,  a cross gu., fimbriated arg._, represents the Cross of St. George in our  National \"Union Jack.\" A Cross having its four extremities cut off  square, so that it does not extend in any direction to the border-lines  of the shield, is \"_couped_\" or \"_humettée_\". If the extremities of a  Cross are cut off to points, it is \"_pointed_,\" as in No. 90. If its  central area is entirely removed, so that but little more than its  outlines remain, it is \"_voided_,\" or (H. 3) \"_a false Cross_\" (\"faux  croix\"): when its four limbs are _equal_ in length, it is a \"_Greek  Cross_,\" as No. 91: when the limbs are _unequal_, the lower limb or  shaft being longer than the other three, as in No. 92, it is a \"_Latin  Cross_\" or a \"long cross\": but neither of these two last terms are used  regarding the plain cross throughout, notwithstanding that differences  in the shape of the shield may materially alter the proportion of the  limbs. If a cross be formed of a shaft and two horizontal limbs only  (like the letter T), as in No. 93, it is a \"_Tau Cross_,\" or \"_Cross  Tau_\": if it is pierced at the intersection of the limbs, and the entire  central area be voided, it is said to be \"_pierced quarterly_.\" A Latin  Cross on steps, is \"_on Degrees_,\" and it is distinguished as a \"Calvary  Cross.\" Charges having a cruciform arrangement are \"_in Cross_.\"      [Illustration: No. 91.]      [Illustration: No. 92.]      [Illustration: No. 93.]      [Illustration: No. 94.--Quadrate.]      [Illustration: No. 95.--Patriarchal.]      [Illustration: No. 96.--Fourchée.]      [Illustration: No. 97.--Cross Moline: Arms of De Molines.]      [Illustration: No. 98.--Cross Recercelée: Arms of Bishop Anthony Bec.]      [Illustration: No. 99.--Cross Patonce: Arms of William de Vesci.]      [Illustration: No. 100.--Fleurie.]      [Illustration: No. 101.--Fleurettée.]      [Illustration: No. 102.--Pommée.]    The CROSS:--its HERALDIC VARIETIES. The Cross-symbol appears in English  Heraldry under very many varieties and modifications of form and  condition, some of them of great beauty. The following engraved  representations of the various examples are so explicit, that  descriptions of them are unnecessary. The Cross _Quadrate_, No. 94. The  Cross _Patriarchal_, No. 95. The Cross _Fourchée_, No. 96. The Cross  _Moline_, represented charged upon the Shield attributed to the SAXON  KINGS OF ENGLAND, No. 23: this same shield--_Az., a Cross moline or_, is  borne by DE MOLINES or MOLYNEUX, No. 97. The Cross _Cercelée_ or  _Recercelée_ (H. 3),--_Gu., a Cross recercelée erm._, No. 98, for  ANTHONY BEC, Bishop of DURHAM. The Cross _Patonce_ (H. 3),--_Gu.,  a Cross patonce arg._, No. 99, from the Seal of WM. DE VESCI, A.D. 1220.  The Cross _Fleury_, No. 100, should be compared carefully with Nos. 97  and 99, the Crosses _Moline_ and _Patonce_. The Cross _Fleurettée_, No.  101. The Cross _Pommée_, No. 102. The Cross _Botonée_ or _Treflée_, No.  103. The Cross _Crosslet_, or _Crosslet crossed_, No. 104. The term  \"_Crosslet_\" is strictly applicable to any Cross on a very small scale:  but it is usually applied to denote a Cross that is crossed as in No.  104. Small Crosses Botonée are occasionally used as these  \"Crosses-Crosslets,\"--as at Warwick in the arms of the BEAUCHAMPS, the  Earls of WARWICK. Crosslets are frequently blazoned _semée_ over the  field of a Shield, in which case the special term _crusilly_ is often  used; and, in smaller numbers, they also are favourite Charges. No. 105  is the Cross _Clechée_ or _Urdée_.      [Illustration: No. 103.--Botonée.]      [Illustration: No. 104.--Crosslet.]      [Illustration: No. 105.--Clechée.]      [Illustration: No. 106.--Patée.]      [Illustration: No. 107.--Maltese.]      [Illustration: No. 108.--Potent.]      [Illustration: No. 109.--Avellane.]      [Illustration: No. 110.--Botonée Fitchée.]    The Cross _Patée_ or _Formée_ is represented in No. 106. No. 107 is the  \"_Cross of eight Points_,\" or the _Maltese_ Cross: this example is drawn  from the portrait of PHILLIPPE DE VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM, elected  forty-third Grand Master of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, A.D.  1521; this picture is in the possession of the Earl of Clarendon, K.G.  The Cross _Potent_, No. 108. The Cross _Avellane_, No. 109. The  _Crossed-Crosslet_, and the Crosses _Patée_, _Botonée_, and _Potent_,  are also drawn having their shaft elongated and _pointed at the base_:  in this form they are severally blazoned as a \"_Crossed-Crosslet  Fitchée_\" (or _fitched_), a \"_Cross Patée Fitchée_,\" &c.,--a Cross, that  is, \"_fixable_\" in the ground; No. 110 is an example of a Cross _Botonée  Fitchée_. Several of these varieties of the heraldic Cross occur but  rarely; and there are other somewhat fanciful varieties so little in  use, as to render any description of them unnecessary. The student of  mediæval monumental antiquities will not fail to observe a certain  degree of resemblance between some of the Crosses of Heraldry, and those  that are incised and sculptured on sepulchral slabs.

Lee (#14)"],[1,"T. J. Jackson, commanding, etc., Swift Run Gap,  Virginia.    \"'General: I have had the honour to receive your letter of yesterday's  date. From the reports that reach me that are entitled to credit, the  force of the enemy opposite Fredericksburg is represented as too large  to admit of any diminution whatever of our army in that vicinity at  present, as it might not only invite an attack on Richmond, but jeopard  the safety of the army in the Peninsula. I regret, therefore, that your  request to have five thousand men sent from that army to reinforce you  cannot be complied with. Can you not draw enough from the command of  General Edward Johnson to warrant you in attacking Banks? The last  return received from that army show a present force of upward of  thirty-five hundred, which, it is hoped, has since increased by recruits  and returned furloughs. As he does not appear to be pressed, it is  suggested that a portion of his force might be temporarily removed from  its present position and made available for the movement in question. A  decisive and successful blow at Banks's column would be fraught with  the happiest results, and I deeply regret my inability to send you the  reinforcements you ask. If, however, you think the combined forces of  Generals Ewell and Johnson, with your own, inadequate for the move,  General Ewell might, with the assistance of General Anderson's army near  Fredericksburg, strike at McDowell's army between that city and Acquia,  with much promise of success; provided you feel sufficiently strong  alone to hold Banks in check.    \"'Very truly yours,    \"'R. E. Lee.'    \"The reader will observe that this letter bears the date 'April 29,  1862.' On May 5th or 6th, General Jackson formed a junction between his  own command and that of General Edward Johnson; on May 8th, he defeated  Milroy at McDowell. Soon thereafter, the command of General Ewell was  united to that already under Jackson, and on the 25th of the same month  Banks was defeated and put to flight. Other incidents might be cited to  illustrate this branch of the important service rendered at this period  by General Lee. The line of earthworks around the city of Richmond, and  other preparations for resisting an attack, testified to the immense  care and labour bestowed upon the defense of the capital, so seriously  threatened by the army of General McClellan.\"    On May 31st, the battle of Seven Pines was fought, and General Joseph  E. Johnston, commanding the Confederate Army, was severely wounded. The  next day, by order of the President, General Lee took command of the  Army of Northern Virginia.    The day after the battle of Cold Harbor, during the \"Seven Days\"  fighting around Richmond, was the first time I met my father after I  had joined General Jackson. The tremendous work Stonewall's men had  performed, including the rapid march from the Valley of Virginia, the  short rations, the bad water, and the great heat, had begun to tell  upon us, and I was pretty well worn out. On this particular morning, my  battery had not moved from its bivouac ground of the previous night, but  was parked in an open field all ready, waiting orders. Most of the men  were lying down, many sleeping, myself among the latter number. To get  some shade and to be out of the way, I had crawled under a caisson,  and was busy making up many lost hours of rest. Suddenly I was rudely  awakened by a comrade, prodding me with a sponge-staff as I had failed  to be aroused by his call, and was told to get up and come out, that  some one wished to see me. Half awake, I staggered out, and found myself  face to face with General Lee and his staff. Their fresh uniforms,  bright equipments and well-groomed horses contrasted so forcibly with  the war-worn appearance of our command that I was completely dazed. It  took me a moment or two to realise what it all meant, but when I saw my  father's loving eyes and smile it became clear to me that he had ridden  by to see if I was safe and to ask how I was getting along. I remember  well how curiously those with him gazed at me, and I am sure that it  must have struck them as very odd that such a dirty, ragged, unkempt  youth could have been the son of this grand-looking victorious  commander.    I was introduced recently to a gentleman, now living in Washington, who,  when he found out my name, said he had met me once before and that it  was on this occasion. At that time he was a member of the Tenth Virginia  Infantry, Jackson's Division, and was camped near our battery. Seeing  General Lee and staff approach, he, with others, drew near to have a  look at them, and thus witnessed the meeting between father and son. He  also said that he had often told of this incident as illustrating the  peculiar composition of our army.    After McClellan's change of base to Harrison's Landing on James River,  the army lay inactive around Richmond. I had a short furlough on account  of sickness, and saw my father; also my mother and sisters, who were  then living in Richmond. He was the same loving father to us all, as  kind and thoughtful of my mother, who as an invalid, and of us, his  children, as if our comfort and happiness were all he had to care for.  His great victory did not elate him, so far as one could see. In a  letter of July 9th, to my mother, he says:    \"...I have returned to my old quarters and am filled with gratitude  to our Heavenly Father for all the mercies He has extended to us. Our  success has not been so great or complete as we could have desired, but  God knows what is best for us. Our enemy met with a heavy loss, from  which it must take him some time to recover, before he can recommence  his operations....\"    The honourable Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederate  States, says of General Lee:    \"What I had seen General lee to be at first--child-like in simplicity  and unselfish in his character--he remained, unspoiled by praise and by  success.\"    He was the same in victory or defeat, always calm and contained.  Jackson, having had a short rest, was now moved up to Gordonsville. I  rejoined my command and went with him, supplied with new clothes and a  fresh stock of health. In a letter to his three daughters who were in  North Carolina, dated Richmond, July 18, 1862, he writes describing my  condition:    \"Rob came out to see me one afternoon. He had been much worn down by his  marching and fighting, and had gone to his mamma to get a little rest.  He was thin but well, but, not being able to get a clean shirt, has not  gone to see Miss Norvell. He has rejoined his company and gone off with  General Jackson, as good as new again, I hope, inasmuch as your mother  thought, by means of a bath and a profusion of soap, she had cleansed  the outward man considerably, and replenished his lost wardrobe.\"    From Gordonsville we were moved on to Orange County, and then commenced  that series of manoeuvres by the Army of Northern Virginia, beginning  with the battle of Cedar Mountain and ending with second Manassas.    When I again saw my father, he rode at the head of Longstreet's men on  the field of Manassas, and we of Jackson's corps, hard pressed for  two days, welcomed him and the divisions which followed him with great  cheers. Two rifle-guns from our battery had been detached and sent  to join Longstreet's advance artillery, under General Stephen D. Lee,  moving into action on our right. I was \"Number 1\" at one of these guns.  We advanced rapidly, from hill to hill, firing as fast as we could,  trying to keep ahead of our gallant comrades, just arrived. As we  were ordered to cease firing from the last position we took, and the  breathless cannoneers were leaning on their guns, General Lee and staff  galloped up, and from this point of vantage scanned the movements of the  enemy and of our forces. The general reined in \"Traveller\" close by my  gun, not fifteen feet from me. I looked at them all some few minutes,  and then went up and spoke to Captain Mason of the staff, who had  not the slightest idea who I was. When he found me out he was greatly  amused, and introduced me to several others whom I already knew. My  appearance was even less prepossessing that when I had met my father at  Cold Harbour, for I had been marching night and day for four days, with  no opportunity to wash myself or my clothes; my face and hands were  blackened with powder-sweat, and the few garments I had on were ragged  and stained with the red soil of that section. When the General, after  a moment or two, dropped his glass to his side, and turned to his staff,  Captain Mason said:    \"General, here is some one who wants to speak to you.\"    The General, seeing a much-begrimed artillery-man, sponge-staff in hand,  said:    \"Well, my many, what can I do for you?\" I replied:    \"Why, General, don't you know me?\" and he, of course, at once recognised  me, and was very much amused at my appearance and most glad to see that  I was safe and well.    We, of the ranks, used to have our opinions on all subjects. The armies,  their generals, and their manoeuvres were freely discussed. If there was  one point on which the entire army was unanimous--I speak of the rank  and file--it was that we were not in the least afraid of General Pope,  but were perfectly sure of whipping him whenever we could meet him. The  passages I quote here from two of General Lee's letters indicate that  this feeling may possibly have extended to our officers. In a letter to  my mother, from near Richmond, dated July 28, 1862, he says:    \"...When you write to Rob, tell him to catch Pope for me, and also bring  in his cousin, Louis Marshall, who, I am told, is on his staff. I could  forgive the latter's fighting against us, but not his joining Pope.\"    And again:    \"...Johnny Lee [his nephew] saw Louis Marshall after Jackson's last  battle, who asked him kindly after his old uncle, and said his mother  was well.
