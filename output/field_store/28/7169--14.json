For  what said the poet?--              Divorce, friend! Re-wed thee! The spring draweth near,[68]            And a wife's but an almanac--good for the year.    If your royal father say anything to you, refer him to what he himself  does.\"    Reassured by these words, Vajramukut bade his friend a cordial  good-night and sought his cot, where he slept soundly, despite the  emotions of the last few hours. The next day passed somewhat slowly. In  the evening, when accompanying his master to the palace, the minister's  son gave him the following directions.    \"Our object, dear my lord, is how to obtain possession of the princess.  Take, then, this trident, and hide it carefully when you see her show  the greatest love and affection. Conceal what has happened, and when  she, wondering at your calmness, asks about me, tell her that last night  I was weary and out of health, that illness prevented my eating her  sweetmeats, but that I shall eat them for supper to-night. When she goes  to sleep, then, taking off her jewels and striking her left leg with the  trident, instantly come away to me. But should she lie awake, rub upon  your thumb a little of this--do not fear, it is only a powder of  grubs fed on verdigris--and apply it to her nostrils. It would make an  elephant senseless, so be careful how you approach it to your own face.\"    Vajramukut embraced his friend, and passed safely through the palace  gate. He found Padmavati awaiting him; she fell upon his bosom and  looked into his eyes, and deceived herself, as clever women will do.  Overpowered by her joy and satisfaction, she now felt certain that  her lover was hers eternally, and that her treachery had not been  discovered; so the beautiful princess fell into a deep sleep.    Then Vajramukut lost no time in doing as the minister's son had advised,  and slipped out of the room, carrying off Padmavati's jewels and  ornaments. His counsellor having inspected them, took up a sack and made  signs to his master to follow him. Leaving the horses and baggage at  the nurse's house, they walked to a burning-place outside the city. The  minister's son there buried his dress, together with that of the prince,  and drew from the sack the costume of a religious ascetic: he assumed  this himself, and gave to his companion that of a disciple. Then quoth  the guru (spiritual preceptor) to his chela (pupil), \"Go, youth, to the  bazar, and sell these jewels, remembering to let half the jewellers in  the place see the things, and if any one lay hold of thee, bring him to  me.\"    Upon which, as day had dawned, Vajramukut carried the princess's  ornaments to the market, and entering the nearest goldsmith's shop,  offered to sell them, and asked what they were worth. As your majesty  well knows, gardeners, tailors, and goldsmiths are proverbially  dishonest, and this man was no exception to the rule. He looked at the  pupil's face and wondered, because he had brought articles whose value  he did not appear to know. A thought struck him that he might make a  bargain which would fill his coffers, so he offered about a thousandth  part of the price. This the pupil rejected, because he wished the affair  to go further. Then the goldsmith, seeing him about to depart, sprang up  and stood in the door way, threatening to call the officers of justice  if the young man refused to give up the valuables which he said had  lately been stolen from his shop. As the pupil only laughed at this,  the goldsmith thought seriously of executing his threat, hesitating only  because he knew that the officers of justice would gain more than he  could by that proceeding. As he was still in doubt a shadow darkened  his shop, and in entered the chief jeweller of the city. The moment the  ornaments were shown to him he recognized them, and said, \"These jewels  belong to Raja Dantawat's daughter; I know them well, as I set them only  a few months ago!\" Then he turned to the disciple, who still held the  valuables in his hand, and cried, \"Tell me truly whence you received  them?\"    While they were thus talking, a crowd of ten or twenty persons had  collected, and at length the report reached the superintendent of the  archers. He sent a soldier to bring before him the pupil, the goldsmith,  and the chief jeweller, together with the ornaments. And when all were  in the hall of justice, he looked at the jewels and said to the young  man, \"Tell me truly, whence have you obtained these?\"    \"My spiritual preceptor,\" said Vajramukut, pretending great fear, \"who  is now worshipping in the cemetery outside the town, gave me these white  stones, with an order to sell them. How know I whence he obtained them?  Dismiss me, my lord, for I am an innocent man.\"    \"Let the ascetic be sent for,\" commanded the kotwal.[69] Then, having  taken both of them, along with the jewels, into the presence of King  Dantawat, he related the whole circumstances.    \"Master,\" said the king on hearing the statement, \"whence have you  obtained these jewels?\"    The spiritual preceptor, before deigning an answer, pulled from under  his arm the hide of a black antelope, which he spread out and smoothed  deliberately before using it as an asan.[70] He then began to finger a  rosary of beads each as large as an egg, and after spending nearly an  hour in mutterings and in rollings of the head, he looked fixedly at the  Raja, and repined:    \"By Shiva! great king, they are mine own. On the fourteenth of the dark  half of the moon at night, I had gone into a place where dead bodies are  burned, for the purpose of accomplishing a witch's incantation. After  long and toilsome labour she appeared, but her demeanour was so unruly  that I was forced to chastise her. I struck her with this, my trident,  on the left leg, if memory serves me. As she continued to be refractory,  in order to punish her I took off all her jewels and clothes, and told  her to go where she pleased. Even this had little effect upon her--never  have I looked upon so perverse a witch. In this way the jewels came into  my possession.\"    Raja Dantawat was stunned by these words. He begged the ascetic not  to leave the palace for a while, and forthwith walked into the private  apartments of the women. Happening first to meet the queen dowager,  he said to her, \"Go, without losing a minute, O my mother, and look at  Padmavati's left leg, and see if there is a mark or not, and what sort  of a mark!\" Presently she returned, and coming to the king said, \"Son,  I find thy daughter lying upon her bed, and complaining that she has met  with an accident; and indeed Padmavati must be in great pain. I found  that some sharp instrument with three points had wounded her. The girl  says that a nail hurt her, but I never yet heard of a nail making  three holes. However, we must all hasten, or there will be erysipelas,  tumefaction, gangrene, mortification, amputation, and perhaps death  in the house,\" concluded the old queen, hurrying away in the pleasing  anticipation of these ghastly consequences.    For a moment King Dantawat's heart was ready to break. But he was  accustomed to master his feelings; he speedily applied the reins of  reflection to the wild steed of passion. He thought to himself, \"the  affairs of one's household, the intentions of one's heart, and whatever  one's losses may be, should not be disclosed to any one. Since Padmavati  is a witch, she is no longer my daughter. I will verily go forth and  consult the spiritual preceptor.\"    With these words the king went outside, where the guru was still sitting  upon his black hide, making marks with his trident on the floor. Having  requested that the pupil might be sent away, and having cleared the  room, he said to the jogi, \"O holy man! what punishment for the heinous  crime of witchcraft is awarded to a woman in the Dharma-Shastra [71]?\"    \"Great king!\" replied the devotee, \"in the Dharma Shastra it is thus  written: 'If a Brahman, a cow, a woman, a child, or any other person  whatsoever who may be dependent on us, should be guilty of a perfidious  act, their punishment is that they be banished the country.' However  much they may deserve death, we must not spill their blood, as  Lakshmi[72] flies in horror from the deed.\"    Hearing these words the Raja dismissed the guru with many thanks and  large presents. He waited till nightfall and then ordered a band of  trusty men to seize Padmavati without alarming the household, and to  carry her into a distant jungle full of fiends, tigers, and bears, and  there to abandon her.    In the meantime, the ascetic and his pupil hurrying to the cemetery  resumed their proper dresses; they then went to the old nurse's house,  rewarded her hospitality till she wept bitterly, girt on their weapons,  and mounting their horses, followed the party which issued from the gate  of King Dantawat's palace. And it may easily be believed that they found  little difficulty in persuading the poor girl to exchange her chance in  the wild jungle for the prospect of becoming Vajramukut's wife--lawfully  wedded at Benares. She did not even ask if she was to have a rival in  the house,--a question which women, you know, never neglect to put  under usual circumstances. After some days the two pilgrims of one love  arrived at the house of their fathers, and to all, both great and small,  excess in joy came.    \"Now, Raja Vikram!\" said the Baital, \"you have not spoken much;  doubtless you are engrossed by the interest of a story wherein a man  beats a woman at her own weapon--deceit."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#14)"],[1,"brass will buy me a new pan.'    No! She has willingly accepted a responsibility. It is her duty to bear  it loyally, faithfully, uncomplainingly to the end.    Let us sum up with the maxim, that the husband should be the senior, but  that the difference of age should not be more than ten years.      WHAT SHOULD BE HIS TEMPERAMENT?    It is often hard to make out what doctors mean by _temperaments_. It is  supposed that our mental and physical characters depend somehow on the  predominance of some organ or system which controls the rest. Thus a  person who is nervous, quick, sensitive to impressions, is said to have  a _nervous_ temperament; one who is stout, full-blooded, red-faced, has  a _sanguine_ temperament; a thin, dark-featured, reticent person, is of  a _bilious_ temperament; while a pale, fat, sluggish nature, is called  _phlegmatic_, or _lymphatic._    In a general way these distinctions are valuable, but they will not bear  very exact applications. They reveal in outline the constitution of mind  and body; and what is to our present purpose, they are of more than  usual importance in the question of selecting a husband.    Nature, hating incongruity, yet loves variety. She preserves the limits  of species, but within those limits she seeks fidelity to one type.  Therefore it is that in marriage a person inclines strongly to one of a  different temperament--to a person quite unlike himself.    So true is this, that a Frenchman of genius, Bernardin de St. Pierre,  vouches for this anecdote of himself. He was in a strange city, visiting  a friend whom he had not seen for years. The friend's sister was of that  age when women are most susceptible. She was tall, a blonde, deliberate  in motion, with blue eyes and fair hair. In a jesting way, St. Pierre,  who had never seen her before, and knew nothing of her personal life,  said,--    'Mademoiselle, you have many admirers. Shall I describe him on whom you  look with most favor?'    The lady challenged him to do so.    'He is short in stature, of dark complexion, dark hair and eyes, slight  in figure, active and nervous in all his movements.'    The lady blushed to her eyes, and cast a glance of anger at her brother,  who, she thought, had betrayed her secret. But no! St. Pierre's only  informant was his deep knowledge of the human heart.    This instinct is founded upon the truth that the perfect temperament is  that happily balanced one which holds all the organs in equilibrium,--in  which no one rules, where all are developed in proportion. Nature ever  strives to realize this ideal. She instills in the nervous temperament a  preference for the lymphatic; in the sanguine, a liking for the bilious  constitution. The offspring should combine the excellencies of both, the  defects of neither. We do well to heed her admonitions here, and to bear  in mind that those matches which combine opposite temperaments, are, as  a rule, the most fortunate.      THE MORAL AND MENTAL CHARACTER.    Very few words are necessary here. We have already said we speak as  physicians, not as moralists. But there are some false and dangerous  ideas abroad, which it is our duty as physicians to combat.    None is more false, none more dangerous, than that embodied in the  proverb, 'A reformed rake makes the best husband.' What is a rake? A man  who has deceived and destroyed trusting virtue,--a man who has entered  the service of the devil to undermine and poison that happiness in  marriage, which all religion and science are at such pains to cultivate.  We know him well in our capacity as physicians. He comes to us  constantly the prey to loathsome diseases, the results of his vicious  life; which diseases he will communicate to his wife, for they are  contagious, and to his children, for they are hereditary; and which no  reform can purge from his system, for they are ineradicable.    Is this the man a pure woman should take to her arms? Here repentance  avails nothing. We have witnessed the agony unspeakable which  overwhelmed a father when he saw his children suffering under horrible  and disgusting diseases, the penalty of his early sins.    Very few men of profligate lives escape these diseases. They are  alarmingly prevalent among the 'fast' youths of our cities. And some  forms of them are incurable by any effort of skill. Even the approach of  such men should be shunned,--their company avoided.    A physician in central Pennsylvania lately had this experience: A young  lady of unblemished character asked his advice for a troublesome  affection of the skin. He examined it, and to his horror recognised a  form of one of the loathsome diseases which curse only the vilest or the  most unfortunate of her sex. Yet he could not suspect this girl. On  inquiry, he found that she had a small but painful sore on her lip,  which she first noticed a few days after being at a picnic with a young  man. Just as he was bidding her good-night, he had kissed her on the  lips.    At once everything was clear. This young man was a patient of the  physician. He was a victim to this vile disease, and even his kiss was  enough to convey it.    The history of the sixteenth century contains the account of an Italian  duke, who on one occasion was forced by his ruler to reconcile himself  with an enemy. Knowing he could not escape obedience, he protested the  most cheerful willingness, and in the presence of the king embraced his  enemy, and even kissed him on the lips. It was but another means of  satisfying his hatred. For he well knew that his kiss would taint his  enemy's blood with the same poison that was undermining his own life.    How cautious, therefore, should a woman be in granting the most innocent  liberties! How solicitous should she be to associate with the purest  men!    Would that we could say that these dangerous and loathsome diseases are  rare! But, alas! daily professional experience forbids us to offer this  consolation. Every physician in our large cities, and even in smaller  towns, knows that they are fearfully prevalent.    We have been consulted by wives, pure, innocent women, for complaints  which they themselves, and sometimes their children, suffered from, the  nature of which we dared not tell them, but which pointed with fatal  finger to the unfaithfulness of the husband. How utterly was their  domestic happiness wrecked when they discovered the cause of their  constant ill-health!    Nor are such occurrences confined to the humbler walks of life. There,  perhaps, less than in any other do they occur. It is in the wealthy, the  luxurious, the self-indulgent class that they are found.    Are we asked how such a dreadful fate can be averted?    There are, indeed, certain signs and marks which such diseases leave  with which physicians are conversant. As if nature intended them as  warnings, they are imprinted on the most visible and public parts of the  body. The skin, the hair, the nose, the voice, the lines on the face,  often divulge to the trained observer, more indubitably than the  confessional, a lewd and sensual life.    Such signs, however, can only be properly estimated by the medical  counselor, and it would be useless to rehearse them here. Those women  who would have a sure guide in choosing a man to be their husband, have  they not Moses and the prophets? What is more, have they not Christ and  the apostles? Rest assured that the man who scoffs at Christianity, who  neglects its precepts and violates its laws, runs a terrible risk of  bringing upon himself, his wife, and his children, the vengeance of  nature, which knows justice but not mercy. Rest assured that the man who  respects the maxims of that religion, and abstains from all uncleanness,  is the only man who is worthy the full and confiding love of an  honorable woman.      THE SYMBOLISM OF THE HUMAN BODY.    Philosophers say that every idle word which is spoken continues to  vibrate in the air through all infinity. So it is with the passions and  the thoughts. Each impresses on the body some indelible mark, and a long  continuance of similar thoughts leaves a visible imprint.    Under the names of phrenology, physiognomy, palmistry, and others,  attempts have been made at divers times to lay down fixed principles by  which we could judge of men by their outsides; but only vague results  have been obtained. A learned German author, of high repute in exact  science, has gone a different way to work. He has studied the body as a  whole, and sought with the eye of an anatomist how different avocations,  passions, temperaments, habits, mould and fashion the external parts of  man. His results are embraced in a curious volume which he entitles _The  Symbolism of the Human Body_. We shall borrow some hints from it,  germane to our present theme.    As to size, large-bodied and large-boned men possess greater energy, a  more masculine character, but often less persistence, and are usually  devoid of the more delicate emotions. Fat people are good-tempered, but  indolent; thin people, full of life, but irascible.    The neck is a significant part of the body. View it from in front, and  it discloses the physical constitution. There are the conduits of the  food and the air; there, the great blood-vessels pass to the head, and  its base is modified by their form as they pass from the heart. When  broad and full, it denotes a vigorous physical life,--a plethoric  constitution. A distinguished teacher of midwifery, Professor Pajot of  Paris, says that when he sees one of those necks full in front, like  that of Marie Antoinette, as shown in her portraits, he prepares himself  to combat childbed convulsions. That queen, it is well-known, nearly  perished with them.    The back of the neck contains the vertebral column, and is close to the  brain. It reveals the mental constitution. The short round neck of the  prize-fighter betrays his craft. The slender, arched, and graceful neck  of the well-pro"]]]
