[Music]    With my Strings of small Wire lo I come,    And a Cittern made of Wood;  And a Song altho' you are Deaf and Dumb,    May be heard and understood.      _Dumb, dumb_----    Oh! take Pity on me, my Dear,    Me thy Slave, and me thy Vassal,  And be not Cruel, as it were,    Like to some strong and well built old Castle.      _Dumb, dumb_----    Lest as thou passest along the Street,    Braver every Day and braver;  Every one that does thee meet,    Will say there goes a Woman-shaver.      _Dumb, dumb_----    And again will think fit,    And to say they will determine;  There goes she that with Tongue killed Clip-Chops,    As a Man with his Thumbs kill Vermine.      _Dumb, dumb_----    For if thou dost then, farewel Pelf,    Farewel _Bridget_, for I vow I'll:  Either in my Bason hang my self,    Or drown me in my Towel,      _Dumb, dumb_----          _A_ BALLAD, _made by a Gentleman in_ Ireland, _who could not have  Access to a Lady whom he went to visit, because the Maid the Night  before had over-laid her pretty Bitch. To the Tune of_, O Hone, O  Hone.      [Music]    Oh! let no Eyes be dry,    _Oh Hone, Oh Hone_,  But let's lament and cry,    _Oh Hone, O Hone_,  We're quite undone almost,  For _Daphne_ on this Coast,  Has yielded up the Ghost,    _Oh Hone, O Hone_.    _Daphne_ my dearest Bitch,    _Oh Hone, O Hone_,  Who did all Dogs bewitch,    _Oh Hone_, &c.  Was by a careless Maid,  Pox take her for a Jade,  In the Night over-laid,    _Oh Hone_, &c.    Oh may she never more    _Oh Hone_, &c.  Sleep quietly, but snore,    _Oh Hone_, &c.  May never Irish Lad,  Sue for her Maiden-head,  Until it stinks I Gad,    _Oh Hone_, &c.    Oh may she never keep    _Oh Hone, Oh Hone_;  Her Water in her Sleep,    _Oh Hone, Oh Hone_:  May never Pence nor Pounds,  Come more within the Bounds,  Of her Pocket Ad-sounds,    _Oh Hone, Oh Hone_.          DAMON _forsaken. Set by Mr._ WROTH.      [Music]    When that young _Damon_ bless'd my Heart,    And in soft Words did move;  How did I hug the pleasing Dart,    And thank'd the God of Love:  _Cupid_, said I, my best lov'd Lamb,    That in my Bosom lives:  To thee, for kindling this dear Flame,    To thee, kind God, I'll give.    But prying Friends o'er-heard my Vow,    And murmur'd in my Ear;  _Damon_ hath neither Flocks nor Plough,    Girl what thou dost beware:  They us'd so long their cursed Art,    And damn'd deluding sham;  That I agreed with them to part,    Nor offer'd up my Lamb.    _Cupid_ ask'd for his Offering,    'Cause I refus'd to pay;  He took my _Damon_ on his Wing,    And carry'd him quite away:  Pitch'd him before _Olinda's_ Charms,    Those Wonders of the Plain;  Commanding her into her Arms,    To take the dearest Swain.    The envy'd Nymph, soon, soon obey'd,    And bore away the Prize;  'Tis well she did, for had she stay'd,    I'd snatch'd him from her Eyes:  My Lamb was with gay Garlands dress'd,    The Pile prepar'd to burn;  Hoping that if the God appeas'd,  My _Damon_ might return.    But oh! in vain he's gone, he's gone,    _Phillis_ he can't be thine;  I by Obedience am undone,    Was ever Fate like mine:  _Olinda_ do, try all thy Charms,    Yet I will have a part;  For whilst you have him in your Arms,    I'll have him in my Heart.          _The Apparition to the Jilted Lover. Set by Mr._ WROTH.      [Music]    Think wretched Mortal, think no more,    How to prolong thy Breath:  For thee there are no Joys in store,    But in a welcome Death:  Then seek to lay thee under Ground,    The Grave cures all Despair;  And healeth every bitter Wound,    Giv'n by th' ungrateful Fair.    How cou'dst thou Faith in Woman think,    Women are _Syrens_ all;  And when Men in Loves Ocean sink,    Take Pride to see 'em fall:  Women were never real yet,    But always truth despise:  Constant to nothing but Deceit,    False Oaths and flattering Lies.    Ah! _Coridon_ bid Life adieu,    The Gods will thee prefer;  Their Gates are open'd wide for you,    But bolted against her:  Do thou be true, you vow'd to Love,    _Phillis_ or Death you'll have;  Now since the Nymph doth perjured prove,    Be just unto the Grave.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    Heaven first created Woman to be Kind,    Both to be belov'd, and for to Love;  If you contradict what Heav'n has design'd,    You'll be contemn'd by all the Pow'rs above:  Then no more dispute me, for I am rashly bent,    To subject your Beauty    To kind Nature's Duty,  Let me than salute you by Consent.    Arguments and fair Intreats did I use,    But with her Consent could not prevail;  She the Blessing modestly would still refuse,    Seeming for to slight my amorous Tale:  Sometimes she would cry Sir, prithee Dear be good,    Oh Sir, pray Sir, why Sir?    Pray now, nay now, fye Sir,  I would sooner die Sir, than be rude.    I began to treat her then another way,    Modestly I melted with a Kiss;  She then blushing look'd like the rising Day,    Fitting for me to attempt the Bliss:  I gave her a fall Sir, she began to tear,    Crying she would call Sir,    As loud as she could baul Sir,  But is prov'd as false, Sir, as she's Fair.          RALPH'S _going to the Wars._      [Music]    To the Wars I must alass,    Though I do not like the Game,  For I hold him to be an Ass,    That will lose his Life for Fame:  _For these Guns are such pestilent things,    To pat a Pellet in ones Brow;  Four vurlongs off ch've heard zome zay,    Ch'ill kill a Man he knows not how._    When the Bow, Bill, Zword and Dagger,    Were us'd all in vighting;  Ch've heard my Father swear and swagger,    That it was but a Flea-biting:  _But these Guns_, &c.    Ise would vight with the best of our Parish,    And play at Whisters with _Mary_;  Cou'd thump the Vootball, yerk the Morrie,    And box at Visticuffs with any:  _But these Guns_, &c.    Varewel _Dick_, _Tom_, _Ralph_ and _Hugh_,    My Maypoles make all heretofore;  Varewel _Doll_, _Kate_, _Zis_ and _Zue_,    For I shall never zee you more:  _For these Guns are such pestilent things,    To pat a Pellet in ones Brow;  Four vurlongs off ch've heard zome zay,    Ch'ill kill a Man he knows not how._          _A_ SONG _in Praise of Punch._      [Music]    Come fill up the Bowl with the Liquor that fine is,    And much more Divine is,  Than now a-days Wine is, with all their Art,    None here can controul:  The Vintner despising, tho' Brandy be rising,    'Tis Punch that must chear the Heart:  The Lovers complaining, 'twill cure in a trice,  And _Caelia_ disdaining, shall cease to be nice,    _Come fill up the Bowl_, &c.    Thus soon you'll discover, the cheat of each Lover,  When free from all Care you'll quickly find,  As Nature intended 'em willing and kind:    _Come fill up the Bowl_, &c.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    Bonny _Peggy Ramsey_ that any Man may see,  And bonny was her Face, with a fair freckel'd Eye,  Neat is her Body made, and she hath good Skill,  And square is her Wethergig made like a Mill:    _With a hey trolodel, hey trolodel, hey trolodel lill,_    _Bonny_ Peggy Ramsey _she gives weel her Mill._    _Peggy_ to the Mill is gone to grind a Bowl of Mault,  The Mill it wanted Water, and was not that a fault;  Up she pull'd her Petticoats and piss'd into the Dam,  For six Days and seven Nights she made the Mill to gang;    _With a hey_, &c.    Some call her _Peggy_, and some call her _Jean_,  But some calls her Midsummer, but they all are mista'en;  For _Peggy_ is a bonny Lass, and grinds well her Mill,  For she will be Occupied when others they lay still:    _With a hey_, &c.    _Peg_, thee and Ise grin a poke, and we to War will leanes,  Ise lay thee flat upon thy Back and then lay to the steanes;  Ise make hopper titter totter, haud the Mouth as still,  When twa sit, and eane stand, merrily grind the Mill:    _With a hey_, &c.    Up goes the Clap, and in goes the Corn,  Betwixt twa rough steans _Peggy_ not to learn;  With a Dam full of Water that she holdeth still,  To pour upon the Clap for burning of the Mill:    _With a hey_, &c.    Up she pull'd the Dam sure and let the Water in,  The Wheel went about, and the Mill began to grind:  The spindle it was hardy, and the steanes were they well pickt,  And the Meal fell in the Mill Trough, and ye may all come lick:    _With a hey trolodel, hey trolodel, hey trolodel lill,_    _Bonny_ Peggy Ramsey _she gives weel her Mill._          _A_ SONG.    _Writ by the Famous Mr._ NAT. LEE.    _Philander_ and _Sylvia_, a gentle soft Pair,  Whose business was loving, and kissing their Care;  In a sweet smelling Grove went smiling along,  'Till the Youth gave a vent to his Heart with his Tongue:  Ah _Sylvia_! said he, (and sigh'd when he spoke)  Your cruel resolves will you never revoke?  No never, she said, how never, he cry'd,  'Tis the Damn'd that shall only that Sentence abide.    She turn'd her about to look all around,  Then blush'd, and her pretty Eyes cast on the Ground;  She kiss'd his warm Cheeks, then play'd with his Neck,  And urg'd that his Reason his Passion would check:  Ah _Philander_! she said, 'tis a dangerous Bliss,  Ah! never ask more and I'll give thee a Kiss;  How never? he cry'd, then shiver'd all o'er,  No never, she said, then tripp'd to a Bower.    She stopp'd at the Wicket, he cry'd let me in,  She answer'd, I wou'd if it were not a sin;  Heav'n sees, and the Gods will chastise the poor Head  Of _Philander_ for this; straight Trembling he said,  Heav'n sees, I confess, but no Tell-tales are there,  She kiss'd him and cry'd, you're an Atheist my Dear;  And shou'd you prove false I should never endure:  How never? he cry'd, and straight down he threw her.    Her delicate Body he clasp'd in his Arms,  He kiss'd her, he press'd her, heap'd charms upon charms;  He cry'd shall I now? no never, she said,  Your Will you shall never enjoy till I'm dead:  Then as if she were dead, she slept and lay still,  Yet even in Death bequeath'd him a smile:  Which embolden'd the Youth his Charms to apply,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],[0,"Ten Years Later (#14)"],[1," the mainmast of the ship.    \"The duke has not acquired a steady footing yet,\" said the queen-mother,  in French, \"and that may possibly be his reason for wishing to find  himself on firm land again.\"    The young man overheard this remark, turned suddenly pale, and, letting  his hands fall in great discouragement by his side, drew aside, mingling  in one sigh his old affection and his new hatreds. The admiral, however,  without taking any further notice of the duke's ill-humor, led the  princesses into the quarter-deck cabin, where dinner had been served  with a magnificence worthy in every respect of his guests. The admiral  seated himself at the right hand of the princess, and placed the Comte  de Guiche on her left. This was the place Buckingham usually occupied;  and when he entered the cabin, how profound was his unhappiness to see  himself banished by etiquette from the presence of his sovereign, to a  position inferior to that which, by rank, he was entitled to. De Guiche,  on the other hand, paler still perhaps from happiness, than his rival  was from anger, seated himself tremblingly next to the princess, whose  silken robe, as it lightly touched him, caused a tremor of mingled  regret and happiness to pass through his whole frame. The repast  finished, Buckingham darted forward to hand Madame Henrietta from the  table; but this time it was De Guiche's turn to give the duke a lesson.  \"Have the goodness, my lord, from this moment,\" said he, \"not to  interpose between her royal highness and myself. From this moment,  indeed, her royal highness belongs to France, and when she deigns to  honor me by touching my hand it is the hand of Monsieur, the brother of  the king of France, she touches.\"    And saying this, he presented his hand to Madame Henrietta with such  marked deference, and at the same time with a nobleness of mien so  intrepid, that a murmur of admiration rose from the English, whilst  a groan of despair escaped from Buckingham's lips. Raoul, who loved,  comprehended it all. He fixed upon his friend one of those profound  looks which a bosom friend or mother can alone extend, either as  protector or guardian, over the one who is about to stray from the right  path. Towards two o'clock in the afternoon the sun shone forth anew, the  wind subsided, the sea became smooth as a crystal mirror, and the fog,  which had shrouded the coast, disappeared like a veil withdrawn before  it. The smiling hills of France appeared in full view, with their  numerous white houses rendered more conspicuous by the bright green of  the trees or the clear blue sky.        Chapter X. The Tents.    The admiral, as we have seen, was determined to pay no further attention  to Buckingham's threatening glances and fits of passion. In fact, from  the moment they quitted England, he had gradually accustomed himself to  his behavior. De Guiche had not yet in any way remarked the animosity  which appeared to influence that young nobleman against him, but he  felt, instinctively, that there could be no sympathy between himself and  the favorite of Charles II. The queen-mother, with greater experience  and calmer judgment, perceived the exact position of affairs, and, as  she discerned its danger, was prepared to meet it, whenever the proper  moment should arrive. Quiet had been everywhere restored, except in  Buckingham's heart; he, in his impatience, addressed himself to the  princess, in a low tone of voice: \"For Heaven's sake, madame, I implore  you to hasten your disembarkation. Do you not perceive how that insolent  Duke of Norfolk is killing me with his attentions and devotions to you?\"    Henrietta heard this remark; she smiled, and without turning her head  towards him, but giving only to the tone of her voice that inflection of  gentle reproach, and languid impertinence, which women and princesses so  well know how to assume, she murmured, \"I have already hinted, my lord,  that you must have taken leave of your senses.\"    Not a single detail escaped Raoul's attention; he heard both  Buckingham's entreaty and the princess's reply; he remarked Buckingham  retire, heard his deep sigh, and saw him pass a hand over his face. He  understood everything, and trembled as he reflected on the position  of affairs, and the state of the minds of those about him. At last the  admiral, with studied delay, gave the last orders for the departure of  the boats. Buckingham heard the directions given with such an exhibition  of delight that a stranger would really imagine the young man's reason  was affected. As the Duke of Norfolk gave his commands, a large boat or  barge, decked with flags, and capable of holding about twenty rowers and  fifteen passengers, was slowly lowered from the side of the admiral's  vessel. The barge was carpeted with velvet and decorated with coverings  embroidered with the arms of England, and with garlands of flowers; for,  at that time, ornamentation was by no means forgotten in these political  pageants. No sooner was this really royal boat afloat, and the rowers  with oars uplifted, awaiting, like soldiers presenting arms, the  embarkation of the princess, than Buckingham ran forward to the ladder  in order to take his place. His progress was, however, arrested by the  queen. \"My lord,\" she said, \"it is hardly becoming that you should allow  my daughter and myself to land without having previously ascertained  that our apartments are properly prepared. I beg your lordship to be  good enough to precede us ashore, and to give directions that everything  be in proper order on our arrival.\"    This was a fresh disappointment for the duke, and, still more so, since  it was so unexpected. He hesitated, colored violently, but could not  reply. He had thought he might be able to keep near Madame during the  passage to the shore, and, by this means, to enjoy to the very last  moment the brief period fortune still reserved for him. The order,  however, was explicit; and the admiral, who heard it given, immediately  called out, \"Launch the ship's gig.\" His directions were executed with  that celerity which distinguishes every maneuver on board a man-of-war.    Buckingham, in utter hopelessness, cast a look of despair at the  princess, of supplication towards the queen, and directed a glance full  of anger towards the admiral. The princess pretended not to notice him,  while the queen turned aside her head, and the admiral laughed outright,  at the sound of which Buckingham seemed ready to spring upon him. The  queen-mother rose, and with a tone of authority said, \"Pray set off,  sir.\"    The young duke hesitated, looked around him, and with a last effort,  half-choked by contending emotions, said, \"And you, gentlemen, M. de  Guiche and M. de Bragelonne, do not you accompany me?\"    De Guiche bowed and said, \"Both M. de Bragelonne and myself await her  majesty's orders; whatever the commands she imposes on us, we shall obey  them.\" Saying this, he looked towards the princess, who cast down her  eyes.    \"Your grace will remember,\" said the queen, \"that M. de Guiche is here  to represent Monsieur; it is he who will do the honors of France, as  you have done those of England; his presence cannot be dispensed with;  besides, we owe him this slight favor for the courage he displayed in  venturing to seek us in such a terrible stress of weather.\"    Buckingham opened his lips, as if he were about to speak, but, whether  thoughts or expressions failed him, not a syllable escaped them, and  turning away, as though out of his mind, he leapt from the vessel into  the boat. The sailors were just in time to catch hold of him to steady  themselves; for his weight and the rebound had almost upset the boat.    \"His grace cannot be in his senses,\" said the admiral aloud to Raoul.    \"I am uneasy on the Duke's account,\" replied Bragelonne.    While the boat was advancing towards the shore, the duke kept his eyes  immovably fixed on the admiral's ship, like a miser torn away from his  coffers, or a mother separated from her child, about to be lead away  to death. No one, however, acknowledged his signals, his frowns, or his  pitiful gestures. In very anguish of mind, he sank down in the boat,  burying his hands in his hair, whilst the boat, impelled by the  exertions of the merry sailors, flew over the waves. On his arrival he  was in such a state of apathy, that, had he not been received at the  harbor by the messenger whom he had directed to precede him, he would  hardly have had strength to ask his way. Having once, however, reached  the house which had been set apart for him, he shut himself up, like  Achilles in his tent. The barge bearing the princess quitted the  admiral's vessel at the very moment Buckingham landed. It was followed  by another boat filled with officers, courtiers, and zealous friends.  Great numbers of the inhabitants of Le Havre, having embarked in  fishing-cobles and boats of every description, set off to meet the royal  barge. The cannon from the forts fired salutes, which were returned by  the flagship and the two other vessels, and the flashes from the  open mouths of the cannon floated in white fumes over the waves, and  disappeared in the clear blue sky.    The princess landed at the decorated quay. Bands of gay music greeted  her arrival, and accompanied her every step she took. During the time  she was passing through the center of town, and treading beneath her  delicate feet the richest carpets and the gayest flowers, which had been  strewn upon the ground, De Guiche and Raoul, escaping from their English  friends, hurried through the town and hastened rapidly towards the place  intended for the residence of Madame.    \"Let us hurry forward,\" said Raoul to De Guiche, \"for if I read  Buckingham's character aright, he will create some disturbance, when he  learns the result of our deliberations of yesterday.\"    \"Never fear,\" said De Guiche, \"De Wardes is there, who is determination  itself,"]]]
