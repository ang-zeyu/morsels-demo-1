Three happy children in a darkened room!      What do they gaze on with wide-open eyes?      A dense, dense forest, where no sunbeam pries,      And in its centre a cleared spot.--There bloom      Gigantic flowers on creepers that embrace      Tall trees; there, in a quiet lucid lake      The white swans glide; there, \"whirring from the brake,\"      The peacock springs; there, herds of wild deer race;      There, patches gleam with yellow waving grain;      There, blue smoke from strange altars rises light,      There, dwells in peace, the poet-anchorite.      But who is this fair lady? Not in vain      She weeps,--for lo! at every tear she sheds      Tears from three pairs of young eyes fall amain,      And bowed in sorrow are the three young heads.      It is an old, old story, and the lay      Which has evoked sad Sita from the past      Is by a mother sung.... 'Tis hushed at last      And melts the picture from their sight away,      Yet shall they dream of it until the day!      When shall those children by their mother's side      Gather, ah me! as erst at eventide?          MISCELLANEOUS POEMS.          NEAR HASTINGS.          Near Hastings, on the shingle-beach,        We loitered at the time      When ripens on the wall the peach,        The autumn's lovely prime.      Far off,--the sea and sky seemed blent,        The day was wholly done,      The distant town its murmurs sent,        Strangers,--we were alone.        We wandered slow; sick, weary, faint,        Then one of us sat down,      No nature hers, to make complaint;--        The shadows deepened brown.      A lady past,--she was not young,        But oh! her gentle face      No painter-poet ever sung,        Or saw such saintlike grace.        She past us,--then she came again,        Observing at a glance      That we were strangers; one, in pain,--        Then asked,--Were we from France?      We talked awhile,--some roses red        That seemed as wet with tears,      She gave my sister, and she said,        \"God bless you both, my dears!\"        Sweet were the roses,--sweet and full,        And large as lotus flowers      That in our own wide tanks we cull        To deck our Indian bowers.      But sweeter was the love that gave        Those flowers to one unknown,      I think that He who came to save        The gift a debt will own.        The lady's name I do not know,        Her face no more may see,      But yet, oh yet I love her so!        Blest, happy, may she be!      Her memory will not depart,        Though grief my years should shade,      Still bloom her roses in my heart!        And they shall never fade!          FRANCE.    1870.          Not dead,--oh no,--she cannot die!        Only a swoon, from loss of blood!      Levite England passes her by,      Help, Samaritan! None is nigh;        Who shall stanch me this sanguine flood?        Range the brown hair, it blinds her eyne,        Dash cold water over her face!      Drowned in her blood, she makes no sign,      Give her a draught of generous wine.        None heed, none hear, to do this grace.        Head of the human column, thus        Ever in swoon wilt thou remain?      Thought, Freedom, Truth, quenched ominous,      Whence then shall Hope arise for us,        Plunged in the darkness all again!        No, she stirs!--There's a fire in her glance,        Ware, oh ware of that broken sword!      What, dare ye for an hour's mischance,      Gather around her, jeering France,        Attila's own exultant horde?        Lo, she stands up,--stands up e'en now,        Strong once more for the battle-fray,      Gleams bright the star, that from her brow      Lightens the world. Bow, nations, bow,        Let her again lead on the way!          THE TREE OF LIFE.          Broad daylight, with a sense of weariness!      Mine eyes were closed, but I was not asleep,      My hand was in my father's, and I felt      His presence near me. Thus we often past      In silence, hour by hour. What was the need      Of interchanging words when every thought      That in our hearts arose, was known to each,      And every pulse kept time? Suddenly there shone      A strange light, and the scene as sudden changed.      I was awake:--It was an open plain      Illimitable,--stretching, stretching--oh, so far!      And o'er it that strange light,--a glorious light      Like that the stars shed over fields of snow      In a clear, cloudless, frosty winter night,      Only intenser in its brilliance calm.      And in the midst of that vast plain, I saw,      For I was wide awake,--it was no dream,      A tree with spreading branches and with leaves      Of divers kinds,--dead silver and live gold,      Shimmering in radiance that no words may tell!      Beside the tree an Angel stood; he plucked      A few small sprays, and bound them round my head.      Oh, the delicious touch of those strange leaves!      No longer throbbed my brows, no more I felt      The fever in my limbs--\"And oh,\" I cried,      \"Bind too my father's forehead with these leaves.\"      One leaf the Angel took and therewith touched      His forehead, and then gently whispered \"Nay!\"      Never, oh never had I seen a face      More beautiful than that Angel's, or more full      Of holy pity and of love divine.      Wondering I looked awhile,--then, all at once      Opened my tear-dimmed eyes--When lo! the light      Was gone--the light as of the stars when snow      Lies deep upon the ground. No more, no more,      Was seen the Angel's face. I only found      My father watching patient by my bed,      And holding in his own, close-prest, my hand.          ON THE FLY-LEAF OF ERCKMANN-CHATRIAN'S NOVEL ENTITLED \"MADAME THERESE.\"          Wavered the foremost soldiers,--then fell back.      Fallen was their leader, and loomed right before      The sullen Prussian cannon, grim and black,      With lighted matches waving. Now, once more,      Patriots and veterans!--Ah! 'Tis in vain!      Back they recoil, though bravest of the brave;      No human troops may stand that murderous rain;      But who is this--that rushes to a grave?        It is a woman,--slender, tall, and brown!      She snatches up the standard as it falls,--      In her hot haste tumbles her dark hair down,      And to the drummer-boy aloud she calls      To beat the charge; then forwards on the _pont_      They dash together;--who could bear to see      A woman and a child, thus Death confront,      Nor burn to follow them to victory?        I read the story and my heart beats fast!      Well might all Europe quail before thee, France,      Battling against oppression! Years have past,      Yet of that time men speak with moistened glance.      _Va-nu-pieds!_ When rose high your Marseillaise      Man knew his rights to earth's remotest bound,      And tyrants trembled. Yours alone the praise!      Ah, had a Washington but then been found!          SONNET.--BAUGMAREE.          A sea of foliage girds our garden round,        But not a sea of dull unvaried green,        Sharp contrasts of all colours here are seen;      The light-green graceful tamarinds abound      Amid the mangoe clumps of green profound,        And palms arise, like pillars gray, between;        And o'er the quiet pools the seemuls lean,      Red,--red, and startling like a trumpet's sound.      But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges        Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon      Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes        Into a cup of silver. One might swoon          Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze          On a primeval Eden, in amaze.          SONNET.--THE LOTUS.          Love came to Flora asking for a flower        That would of flowers be undisputed queen,        The lily and the rose, long, long had been      Rivals for that high honour. Bards of power      Had sung their claims. \"The rose can never tower        Like the pale lily with her Juno mien\"--        \"But is the lily lovelier?\" Thus between      Flower-factions rang the strife in Psyche's bower.      \"Give me a flower delicious as the rose        And stately as the lily in her pride\"--      \"But of what colour?\"--\"Rose-red,\" Love first chose,        Then prayed,--\"No, lily-white,--or, both provide;\"        And Flora gave the lotus, \"rose-red\" dyed,      And \"lily-white,\"--the queenliest flower that blows.          OUR CASUARINA TREE.          Like a huge Python, winding round and round        The rugged trunk, indented deep with scars        Up to its very summit near the stars,      A creeper climbs, in whose embraces bound        No other tree could live. But gallantly      The giant wears the scarf, and flowers are hung      In crimson clusters all the boughs among,        Whereon all day are gathered bird and bee;      And oft at nights the garden overflows      With one sweet song that seems to have no close,      Sung darkling from our tree, while men repose.        When first my casement is wide open thrown        At dawn, my eyes delighted on it rest;        Sometimes, and most in winter,--on its crest      A grey baboon sits statue-like alone        Watching the sunrise; while on lower boughs      His puny offspring leap about and play;      And far and near kokilas hail the day;        And to their pastures wend our sleepy cows;      And in the shadow, on the broad tank cast      By that hoar tree, so beautiful and vast,      The water-lilies spring, like snow enmassed.        But not because of its magnificence        Dear is the Casuarina to my soul:        Beneath it we have played; though years may roll,      O sweet companions, loved with love intense,        For your sakes, shall the tree be ever dear!      Blent with your images, it shall arise      In memory, till the hot tears blind mine eyes!        What is that dirge-like murmur that I hear      Like the sea breaking on a shingle-beach?

A little  black wax will join the eyelids to the glass eyes if they have shrunk  away and the inside of the nostrils should be coated with a little pink.  Bare skin on the end of the nose should be varnished.          CHAPTER XV.    MOUNTING LARGE ANIMALS ENTIRE.      Though at one time nearly all animals were mounted by the soft body or  stuffing method as described in the previous chapter, very few of the  larger ones are so treated now. An adequate frame is built in a body of  the proper size and proportions, the surface of which reproduces those  muscles lying next the skin. The skin, well pared down and poisoned, is  sewed, pinned and glued to this surface.    In the small specimen clay was used next the skin in places to perfect  the modelling, but such amounts would be required for a large animal as  to affect the durability of the skin. Clay and plaster being in a dry  state very absorbent, will eventually rob of all oily matter any skin in  contact with them. Such skins will crack, split and finally disintegrate  as thoroughly as those having an excess of fat adhering to them.    To prevent this a layer of some glue composition or paper is used just  beneath the skin. As an example in this mode of mounting a black bear  would answer nicely. If the leg bones are attached to the skin they may  be unjointed at the toes and laid aside while the skin is well shaved  down on its entire inner surface. A thoroughly flexible skin is entirely  at the command of the taxidermist, one stiff or hard cannot be placed or  kept in place at will.    After beaming, splitting the lips and nose cartilage, pocketing the ears  and sewing up cuts and tears, the skin is dropped in the pickle. An  outline sketch is made with chalk on the shop floor and on this the  bones of the legs are arranged. A stiff wire bent along the back of each  set of leg bones will guide us in bending the iron rods used as  supports. These should be from 5/16 to 1/2 inch in diameter, threaded  and fitted with two nuts at the lower end and eighteen inches or so  longer than the leg bones themselves.    Of this extra length, enough is allowed below the feet to fasten to the  pedestal, the balance is bent in a right angle from the end of the upper  leg bone. At the distance of the hip joint from the central line of the  body it is bent again parallel with the back board; for a hind leg. The  front leg rods are bent in the same way at the joining of the shoulder  blade with the humerus or upper bone of the front leg. You will readily  see the desirability of preserving at least one set each of the hind and  front leg bones. In such case the missing bones can be roughly blocked  out of wood to the proper dimensions, while if none are saved you will  have to do the same depending on the skin for measurements.    [Illustration: FRAME FOR BEAR MANIKIN.]    The end of the rods lying along the back should be bent again in a V  shape to prevent their turning when fastened to it. The location of the  hip and shoulder joints are marked on one side of the back board, the  rods for that side laid in place and fastened by drilling holes each  side of them and passing loops of stout wire through and twisting them  tightly on the other side with heavy pliers. The rods for the other side  are fastened in the same manner, in fact they may be fastened with the  same wires, but it will be stronger if the fastenings are separate. The  leg bones are bound fast to the rods with wire or twine.    Holding the back board in the vise by the middle the leg rods with bone  attached are adjusted to the position of the finished specimen. The  threaded ends which project below the feet are bent straight down.    A rough pedestal of boards on 2x4 cleats at each end, is made, the frame  placed on it and marking where the rods will enter, bore suitable holes  to receive them. One nut is turned up each rod a short distance and  after inserting in the holes in the pedestal the others are screwed up  tightly from below.    Our frame now stands alone and rigid and should be viewed from all sides  to correct any errors. It should not be too high, front or rear, and  also having the back-board perfectly vertical or plumb. Insert two  pieces of rod in the opening at the back of the skull and fasten them  there by mixing enough plaster of paris and water to fill the cavity, to  the consistency of molasses and pouring it in around them.    The ends of the rods should be bent or roughened to prevent them  slipping out after the plaster has set. A surplus of plaster can be  placed around the articulation of the jaws, at the same time holding  them in place. These neck rods are to run beside and be fastened to the  back-board as the legs were.    Let one remain straight and fasten it loosely so it may be drawn in and  out the loops until the proper length of neck is formed, then tighten  them and fasten the other rod also. Before fastening these try the skin  over the frame, making sure it will cover in all directions. A tail wire  stapled to the top of the back-board completes the frame.    [Illustration: BOLTING LEG RODS TO STAND.]    If two good sized rectangular holes are cut in the back-board just in  front of the hind legs and behind the shoulders they will be useful  later in shaping the body by sewing back and forth with a mattress  needle and cord. Drive a row of lath nails into the top and bottom edges  of the back-board about half their length at 2 inch intervals. They will  enable you to build up first one side, then the other of the body by  winding down excelsior with wrapping cord. These nails are driven fully  in when the winding is finished.    The limbs also are built up by using the same material. Do not build up  any part to a perfect fit yet, however, as we must leave room for a  shell of paper 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Depressions in body and limbs are  reproduced by sewing from side to side or drawing down with nails.    The neck and skull are built up in much the same way and the skin  fitting loosely, the manikin is surfaced up with a coat of soft  modelling clay well rubbed in with a small trowel. The paper coating is  to be applied while the clay is still damp so a large specimen must be  partly covered with a damp cloth to prevent it drying out prematurely.    The paper for this purpose should be of some soft easily pulped variety;  common building paper is good and may be torn in pieces of various size,  soaked in water 15 minutes, then squeezed out and coated on both sides  with paste. This is applied to the surface of the figure, the edges  overlapping slightly, until completely covered. Use paper of a different  color for each alternate coat to insure its completion. Five or six  coats will be sufficient when it may be left to dry, after which treat  it to a good coat of shellac.    The skin is withdrawn from the pickle, rinsed in soda solution, put  through the benzine and meal drying and coated on the entire inner  surface with preservative. Glue coated ear forms are slipped into place  and fastened by long stitches back and forth through the ears. The feet  and bases of ears are filled with papier mache pulp and the surface of  the manikin coated with liquid glue.    Now the skin is put on the form to stay, fastening down the central line  of the back with wire brads and drawn together at the junction of legs  and body with stout stitches. The legs are sewn up first and the opening  cut of the body last. A surplus of skin may be worked out and  distributed with the point of an awl, while it may be pulled and  stretched to cover a shortage in another point without changing the  animal's form in the least.    The ears are pinned in place and their bases distended by tow pressed in  with stuffers. Pointed wires thrust through the openings of the ears  into the skull will hold them in place until dry.    The nose, lips and around the eyes are correctly placed, filling  slightly between the skin and paper if necessary, use plenty of common  pins to hold the skin in place. They are either drawn or cut off flush  in short-haired skins when dry, but in one like the bear they may be  driven to the head and left so.    Any places not inclined to stay put may be clamped down with strips of  cardboard pinned on. The glass eyes should be placed now before setting  away to dry, which will require some time.    When dry any bare patches of skin will have a dead appearance and  require painting with oil colors thinned with turpentine to reduce the  gloss. The end of the nose and lips are touched with varnish to produce  the natural moist appearance.    If mounted with open mouth this is modelled in paper and wax coated as  already described. The fur which should have been nicely combed after  mounting will need another brushing and the animal is ready for removal  to a permanent mount or pedestal. Some little judgment can be displayed  in this selection as a poor, rough mounting will detract from the  appearance of the best work while a specimen far below the average will  pass muster with tasteful and suitable surroundings. The same principles  will apply with some exceptions in mounting about all large animals.    Some of the most ponderous have a hollow wooden frame made to reduce the  bulk of filling required; this is covered with wooden strips or lath and  this in turn with a layer of fibrous material.    Supporting rods more than 1/2 inch in diameter must have both ends  threaded and be connected with the back-board by iron squares. These  consist of a rectangular piece of iron, bent at right angles and drilled  with a number of holes in both flanges. One set of these is for screwing  to the back-board while the others are of a size to receive the upper  end of the leg rod. By changing these from one hole to another it is  possible to vary the distance somewhat"]]]
