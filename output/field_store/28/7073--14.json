My father  said that he thought he was a good and holy man, and full of the  Spirit of God. He did works of great power, too; but bore himself  meekly, like any other man. My father always regards him as a  prophet; and said that he grieved, when he heard that he had been  put to death at Jerusalem. If he were a prophet, what he said about  the destruction of Jerusalem should have weight with us.\"    \"All who heard him agreed that he was a good man,\" Joab assented.  \"I have never known one of those who heard him say otherwise, and  maybe he was a prophet. Certainly, he called upon the people to  repent and turn from their sins and, had they done as he taught  them, these evils might not have fallen upon us, and God would  doubtless have been ready to aid his people, as of old.    \"However, it is too late to think about it, now. We want all our  thoughts for the matter we have in hand. We have done all that we  can to put this town into a state of defense and, methinks, if the  Romans ever penetrate through these mountains and forests, they  will see that they have a task which will tax all their powers,  before they take Jotapata.\"    The position of the town was, indeed, immensely strong. It stood on  the summit of a lofty mass of rock which, on three sides, fell  abruptly down into the deep and almost impassable ravines which  surrounded it. On the north side, alone, where the ridge sloped  more gradually down, it could be approached. The town extended part  of the way down this declivity and, at its foot, Josephus had built  a strong wall. On all sides were lofty mountains, covered with  thick forests; and the town could not be seen by an enemy, until  they were close at hand.    As soon as Vespasian had arrived at Ptolemais (on the site of which  city stands the modern Acre) he was met by a deputation from  Sepphoris. That city had only been prevented from declaring for the  Romans by the exertions of Josephus, and the knowledge that all  Galilee would follow him to attack it, should it revolt. But as  soon as Vespasian arrived at Ptolemais, which was scarce twenty  miles away, they sent deputies with their submission to him;  begging that a force might be sent, to defend them against any  attack by the Jews.    Vespasian received them with courtesy; and sent Placidus, with a  thousand horse and six thousand foot, to the city. The infantry  took up their quarters in the town; but the horsemen made raids  over the plains, burning the villages, slaying all the men capable  of bearing arms, and carrying off the rest of the population as  slaves.    The day after the conversation between Joab and John, a man brought  the news to Jotapata that Placidus was marching against it.  Josephus at once ordered the fighting men to assemble and, marching  out, placed them in ambuscade, in the mountains, on the road by  which the Romans would approach.    As soon as the latter had fairly entered the pass, the Jews sprang  to their feet, and hurled their javelins and shot their arrows  among them. The Romans, in vain, endeavored to reach their  assailants; and numbers were wounded, as they tried to climb the  heights, but few were killed--for they were so completely covered,  by their armor and shields, that the Jewish missiles, thrown from a  distance, seldom inflicted mortal wounds. They were, however,  unable to make their way further; and Placidus was obliged to  retire to Sepphoris, having failed, signally, in gaining the credit  he had hoped for, from the capture of the strongest of the Jewish  strongholds in Upper Galilee.    The Jews, on their part, were greatly inspirited by the success of  their first encounter with the Romans; and returned, rejoicing, to  their stronghold.    All being ready at Jotapata, Josephus--with a considerable number  of the fighting men--proceeded to Garis, not far from Sepphoris,  where the army had assembled. But no sooner had the news arrived,  that the great army of Vespasian was in movement, than they  dispersed in all directions; and Josephus was left with a mere  handful of followers, with whom he fled to Tiberias. Thence he  wrote earnest letters to Jerusalem; saying that, unless a strong  army was fitted out and put in the field, it was useless to attempt  to fight the Romans; and that it would be wiser to come to terms  with them, than to maintain a useless resistance, which would bring  destruction upon the nation. He remained a short time, only, at  Tiberias; and thence hurried up with his followers to Jotapata,  which he reached on the 14th of May.    Vespasian marched first to Gadara--which was undefended, the  fighting men having all gone to Jotapata--but, although no  resistance was offered, Vespasian put all the males to the sword;  and burned the town and all the villages in the neighborhood, and  then advanced against Jotapata. For four days, the pioneers of the  Roman army had labored incessantly--cutting a road through the  forests, filling up ravines, and clearing away obstacles--and, on  the fifth day, the road was constructed close up to Jotapata.    On the 14th of May, Placidus and Ebutius were sent forward by  Vespasian, with a thousand horse, to surround the town and cut off  all possibility of escape. On the following day Vespasian himself,  with his whole army, arrived there. The defenders of Jotapata could  scarcely believe their eyes when they saw the long, heavy  column--with all its baggage, and siege engines--marching along a  straight and level road, where they had believed that it would be  next to impossible for even the infantry of the enemy to make their  way. If this marvel had been accomplished in five days, what hope  was there that the city would be able to withstand this force,  which had so readily triumphed over the defenses of nature?        Chapter 5: The Siege Of Jotapata.      \"Well, Joab, what do you think, now?\" John said, as he stood on the  wall with his older companion, watching the seemingly endless  column of the enemy. \"It seems to me that we are caught here, like  rats in a trap, and that we should have done better, a thousand  times, in maintaining our freedom of movement among the mountains.  It is one thing to cut a road; it would be another to clear off all  the forests from the Anti-Libanus and, so long as there was a  forest to shelter us, the Romans could never have overtaken us.  Here, there is nothing to do but to die.\"    \"That is so, John. I own that the counsel you urged would have been  wiser than this. Here are all the best fighting men in Galilee,  shut up without hope of succor, or of mercy. Well, lad, we can at  least teach the Romans the lesson that the Jews know how to die;  and the capture of this mountain town will cost them as much as  they reckoned would suffice for the conquest of the whole country.  Jotapata may save Jerusalem, yet.\"    John was no coward, and was prepared to fight to the last; but he  was young, and the love of life was strong within. He thought of  his old father and mother, who had no children but him; of his  pretty Mary--far away now, he hoped, on the slopes of Mount  Hermon--and of the grief that his death would cause to them; and he  resolved that, although he would do his duty, he would strain every  nerve to preserve the life so dear to them.    He had no longer any duties to perform, other than those common to  all able to bear arms. When the Romans attacked, his place would be  near Josephus or, were a sally ordered, he would issue out with the  general; but until then, his time was his own. There was no mission  to be performed, now, no fear of plots against the life of the  general; therefore, he was free to wander where he liked. Save the  newly erected wall, across the neck of rock below the town, there  were no defenses; for it was deemed impossible for man to climb the  cliffs that fell, sheer down, at every other point.    John strolled quietly round the town; stopping, now and then, to  look over the low wall that bordered the precipice--erected solely  to prevent children from falling over. The depth was very great;  and it seemed to him that there could be no escape, anywhere, save  on that side which was now blocked by the wall--and which would,  ere long, be trebly blocked by the Romans.    The town was crowded. At ordinary times, it might contain near  three or four thousand inhabitants; now, over twenty-five thousand  had gathered there. Of these, more than half were men; but many had  brought their wives and children with them. Every vacant foot of  ground was taken up. The inhabitants shared their homes with the  strangers, but the accommodation was altogether insufficient; and  the greater part of the newcomers had erected little tents, and  shelters, of cloths or blankets.    In the upper part of the town there were, at present, comparatively  few people about; for the greater part had gone to the slope,  whence they watched, with terror and dismay, the great Roman column  as it poured down, in an unbroken line, hour after hour. The news  of the destruction which had fallen on Gadara had been brought in,  by fugitives; and all knew that, although no resistance had been  offered there, every male had been put to death, and the women  taken captives.    There was naught, then, to be gained by surrender; even had anyone  dared to propose it. As for victory, over such a host as that which  was marching to the assault, none could hope for it. For, hold out  as they might, and repel every assault on the wall, there was an  enemy within which would conquer them.    For Jotapata possessed no wells. The water had, daily, to be  fetched by the women from the stream in the ravine and, although  stores of grain had been collected, sufficient to last for many  months, the supply of water stored up in cisterns would scarce  suffice to supply the multitudes gathered on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21615"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 1 (#14)"],[1,"whose lives were devoted to this purpose, Poggio the  Florentine stands distinguished; but he complains that his zeal was not  assisted by the great. He found under a heap of rubbish in a decayed  coffer, in a tower belonging to the monastery of St. Gallo, the work of  Quintilian. He is indignant at its forlorn situation; at least, he  cries, it should have been preserved in the library of the monks; but I  found it _in teterrimo quodam et obscuro carcere_--and to his great joy  drew it out of its grave! The monks have been complimented as the  preservers of literature, but by facts, like the present, their real  affection may be doubted.    The most valuable copy of Tacitus, of whom so much is wanting, was  likewise discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. It is a curious  circumstance in literary history, that we should owe Tacitus to this  single copy; for the Roman emperor of that name had copies of the works  of his illustrious ancestor placed in all the libraries of the empire,  and every year had ten copies transcribed; but the Roman libraries seem  to have been all destroyed, and the imperial protection availed nothing  against the teeth of time.    The original manuscript of Justinian's Pandects was discovered by the  Pisans, when they took a city in Calabria; that vast code of laws had  been in a manner unknown from the time of that emperor. This curious  book was brought to Pisa; and when Pisa was taken by the Florentines,  was transferred to Florence, where it is still preserved.    It sometimes happened that manuscripts were discovered in the last  agonies of existence. Papirius Masson found, in the house of a  bookbinder of Lyons, the works of Agobard; the mechanic was on the point  of using the manuscripts to line the covers of his books.[15] A page of  the second decade of Livy, it is said, was found by a man of letters in  the parchment of his battledore, while he was amusing himself in the  country. He hastened to the maker of the battledore--but arrived too  late! The man had finished the last page of Livy--about a week before.    Many works have undoubtedly perished in this manuscript state. By a  petition of Dr. Dee to Queen Mary, in the Cotton library, it appears  that Cicero's treatise _De Republica_ was once extant in this country.  Huet observes that Petronius was probably entire in the days of John of  Salisbury, who quotes fragments, not now to be found in the remains of  the Roman bard. Raimond Soranzo, a lawyer in the papal court, possessed  two books of Cicero \"on Glory,\" which he presented to Petrarch, who lent  them to a poor aged man of letters, formerly his preceptor. Urged by  extreme want, the old man pawned them, and returning home died suddenly  without having revealed where he had left them. They have never been  recovered. Petrarch speaks of them with ecstasy, and tells us that he  had studied them perpetually. Two centuries afterwards, this treatise on  Glory by Cicero was mentioned in a catalogue of books bequeathed to a  monastery of nuns, but when inquired after was missing. It was supposed  that Petrus Alcyonius, physician to that household, purloined it, and  after transcribing as much of it as he could into his own writings, had  destroyed the original. Alcyonius, in his book _De Exilio_, the critics  observed, had many splendid passages which stood isolated in his work,  and were quite above his genius. The beggar, or in this case the thief,  was detected by mending his rags with patches of purple and gold.    In this age of manuscript, there is reason to believe, that when a man  of letters accidentally obtained an unknown work, he did not make the  fairest use of it, but cautiously concealed it from his contemporaries.  Leonard Aretino, a distinguished scholar at the dawn of modern  literature, having found a Greek manuscript of Procopius _De Bello  Gothico_, translated it into Latin, and published the work; but  concealing the author's name, it passed as his own, till another  manuscript of the same work being dug out of its grave, the fraud of  Aretino was apparent. Barbosa, a bishop of Ugento, in 1649, has printed  among his works a treatise, obtained by one of his domestics bringing in  a fish rolled in a leaf of written paper, which his curiosity led him to  examine. He was sufficiently interested to run out and search the fish  market, till he found the manuscript out of which it had been torn. He  published it, under the title _De Officio Episcopi_. Machiavelli acted  more adroitly in a similar case; a manuscript of the Apophthegms of the  Ancients by Plutarch having fallen into his hands, he selected those  which pleased him, and put them into the mouth of his hero Castrucio  Castricani.    In more recent times, we might collect many curious anecdotes concerning  manuscripts. Sir Robert Cotton one day at his tailor's discovered that  the man was holding in his hand, ready to cut up for measures--an  original Magna Charta, with all its appendages of seals and signatures.  This anecdote is told by Colomies, who long resided in this country; and  an original Magna Charta is preserved in the Cottonian library  exhibiting marks of dilapidation.    Cardinal Granvelle[16] left behind him several chests filled with a  prodigious quantity of letters written in different languages,  commented, noted, and underlined by his own hand. These curious  manuscripts, after his death, were left in a garret to the mercy of the  rain and the rats. Five or six of these chests the steward sold to the  grocers. It was then that a discovery was made of this treasure. Several  learned men occupied themselves in collecting sufficient of these  literary relics to form eighty thick folios, consisting of original  letters by all the crowned heads in Europe, with instructions for  ambassadors, and other state-papers.    A valuable secret history by Sir George Mackenzie, the king's advocate  in Scotland, was rescued from a mass of waste paper sold to a grocer,  who had the good sense to discriminate it, and communicated this curious  memorial to Dr. M'Crie. The original, in the handwriting of its author,  has been deposited in the Advocate's Library. There is an hiatus, which  contained the history of six years. This work excited inquiry after the  rest of the MSS., which were found to be nothing more than the sweepings  of an attorney's office.    Montaigne's Journal of his Travels into Italy has been but recently  published. A prebendary of Perigord, travelling through this province to  make researches relative to its history, arrived at the ancient  _chateau_ of Montaigne, in possession of a descendant of this great man.  He inquired for the archives, if there had been any. He was shown an old  worm-eaten coffer, which had long held papers untouched by the incurious  generations of Montaigne. Stifled in clouds of dust, he drew out the  original manuscript of the travels of Montaigne. Two-thirds of the work  are in the handwriting of Montaigne, and the rest is written by a  servant, who always speaks of his master in the third person. But he  must have written what Montaigne dictated, as the expressions and the  egotisms are all Montaigne's. The bad writing and orthography made it  almost unintelligible. They confirmed Montaigne's own observation, that  he was very negligent in the correction of his works.    Our ancestors were great hiders of manuscripts: Dr. Dee's singular MSS.  were found in the secret drawer of a chest, which had passed through  many hands undiscovered; and that vast collection of state-papers of  Thurloe's, the secretary of Cromwell, which formed about seventy volumes  in the original manuscripts, accidentally fell out of the false ceiling  of some chambers in Lincoln's-Inn.    A considerable portion of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's Letters I  discovered in the hands of an attorney: family-papers are often  consigned to offices of lawyers, where many valuable manuscripts are  buried. Posthumous publications of this kind are too frequently made  from sordid motives: discernment and taste would only be detrimental to  the views of bulky publishers.[17]      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 13: This important political treatise was discovered in the  year 1823, by Angelo Maii, in the library of the Vatican. A treatise on  the Psalms covered it. This second treatise was written in the clear,  minute character of the middle ages, but beneath it Maii saw distinct  traces of the larger letters of the work of Cicero; and to the infinite  joy of the learned succeeded in restoring to the world one of the most  important works of the great orator.]    [Footnote 14: \"Many bishops and abbots began to consider learning as  pernicious to true piety, and confounded illiberal ignorance with  Christian simplicity,\" says Warton. The study of Pagan authors was  declared to inculcate Paganism; the same sort of reasoning led others to  say that the reading of the Scriptures would infallibly change the  readers to Jews; it is amusing to look back on these vain efforts to  stop the effect of the printing-press.]    [Footnote 15: Agobard was Archbishop of Lyons, and one of the most  learned men of the ninth century. He was born in 779; raised to the  prelacy in 816, from which he was expelled by Louis le Debonnaire for  espousing the cause of his son Lothaire; he fled to Italy, but was  restored to his see in 838, dying in 840, when the Church canonized him.  He was a strenuous Churchman, but with enlightened views; and his style  as an author is remarkable alike for its clearness and perfect  simplicity. His works were unknown until discovered in the manner  narrated above, and were published by the discoverer at Paris in 1603,  the originals being bequeathed to the Royal Library at his death. On  examination, several errors were found in this edition, and a new one  was published in 1662, to which another treatise by Agobard was added.]    [Footnote 16: The celebrated minister of Philip II."]]]
