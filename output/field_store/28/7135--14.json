First, the isinglass is to be tightly packed into a bottle with a wide  neck, then add the water, and let the isinglass soak it up.  Afterwards pour in the acetic acid, and keep the mixture near 100 deg.C.  for an hour or two on the water bath--or rather in it.  The total  volume of acetic acid and water should not be more than about half of  the volume of isinglass when the latter is pressed into the bottle as  tightly as possible.    The proper consistency of the cement may be ascertained by lifting a  drop out of the bottle and allowing it to cool on a sheet of glass.  In ten minutes it ought not to be more than slightly sticky, and the  mass in the bottle, after standing a few hours cold, should not be  sticky at all, and should yield, jelly-like, to the pressure of the  finger to only a slight degree.  If the glue is too weak, more  isinglass may be added (without any preliminary soaking).    A person making the mixture for the first time almost always gets it  too weak.  It is difficult to give exact proportions by weight, as  isinglass and gelatine (which may replace it) differ greatly in  quality.  This cement is applied like glue, and will cement nearly  anything as well as glass.  Of course, as much cement as possible must  be squeezed out of any joint where it is employed.  The addition of  gums, as recommended in some books, is unnecessary.    Ordinary glue will serve perfectly for cementing glass to wood.    \"Chipped glass\" ware is, I understand, made by painting clean glass  with glue.  As the glue dries and breaks by contraction, it chips off  the surface of the glass.  I have never seen this done.  In nearly all  cases where alcohol is not to be employed very strong joints may be  made by shellac.  Orange shellac is stronger than the \"bleached\"  variety.    A sine qua non is that the glass be hot enough to melt the shellac.  The best way is to heat the glass surfaces and rub on the shellac from  a bit of flake;  the glass should not be so hot as to discolour the  shellac appreciably, or its valuable properties will be partly  destroyed.  Both glass surfaces being thus prepared, and the shellac  being quite fluid on both, they may be brought together and clamped  tightly together till cool.  Shellac that has been overheated, or  dissolved in alcohol, or bleached, is of little use as compared with  the pale orange flaky product.  Dark flakes have probably been  overheated during the preliminary refining.    For many purposes a cement is required capable of resisting carbon  bisulphide.  This is easily made by adding a little treacle (say 20  per cent) to ordinary glue.  Since the mixture of glue and treacle  does not keep, i.e.  it cannot be satisfactorily melted up again after  once it has set, no more should be made up than will be wanted at the  time.  If the glue be thick, glass boxes for carbon disulphide may be  easily put together, even though the edges of the glass strips are not  quite smooth, for, unlike most cements, this mixture remains tough,  and is fairly strong in itself.    I have found by experiment that most fixed and, to a less degree,  essential oils have little or no solvent action on shellac, and I  suspect that the same remark applies to the treacle-glue mixture, but  I have not tried.  Turpenes act on shellac slightly, but mineral oils  apparently not at all.  The tests on which these statements are based  were continued for about two years, during which time kerosene and  mineral oils had no observable effect on shellac--fastened  galvanometer mirrors.    Sec. 49.  Fusing Electrodes into Glass.    This art has greatly improved since the introduction of the  incandescent lamp; however, up to the present, platinum seems to  remain the only substance capable of giving a certainly air-tight  result.  I have not tried the aluminium-alumina method.    Many years ago it was the fashion to surround the platinum wire with a  drop of white enamel glass in order to cause better adhesion between  it and the ordinary glass.  [Footnote: Hittorf and Geissler (Pogg.  Ann.  1864, Sec. 35;  English translation, Phys.  Soc.  London, p.  138)  found that it was impossible to make air-tight joints between platinum  and hard potash glass, but that soft lead glass could be used with  success as a cement.]  However, in the case of flint glass, if one may  judge from incandescent lamps, this is not essential--a fact which  entirely coincides with my own experience.    On the other hand, when sealing electrodes into German glass I have  often used a drop of enamel with perfect results, though this is not  always done in Germany.  In all cases, however, in which electrodes  have to be sealed in--especially when they are liable to heat--I  recommend flint glass, and in this have the support of Mr. Rain (The  Incandescent Lamp and its Manufacture, p.  131).  The exact details  for the preparation of eudiometer tubes are given by Faraday (Chemical  Manipulation, Sec. 1200).    In view of what has preceded, however, I will content myself with the  following notes.  Make the hole through which the wire is to protrude  only slightly larger than the wire itself, and be sure that the latter  is clean.  Allow the glass to cool sufficiently not to stick to the  wire when the latter is pushed in.  Be sure that, on heating, the  glass does not get reduced, and that it flows up to the wire all  round;  pull and push the wire a little with a pair of pincers, to  ensure this.    It is not a bad plan to get the glass exceedingly fluid round the  wire--even if the lump has to be blown out a little afterwards--as it  cools.  The seal should finally be well annealed in asbestos, but  first by gradually moving it into the hot air in front of the flame.    It was observed by Professor J.  J.  Thomson and the author some years  ago (Proc.  Roy.  Soc.  40.  331.  1886) that when very violent  discharges are taken through lightly sealed-in electrodes in  lead-glass tubes--say from a large battery of Leyden jars--gas  appears to be carried into the tube over and above that naturally  given off by the platinum, and this without there being any apparent  want of perfection in the seal.  This observation has since been  confirmed by others.  Consequently in experiments on violent  discharges in vacuo where certainty is required as to the exclusion of  air, the seals should be protected by a guard tube or cap containing  mercury; this must, of course, be put in hot and clean, on hot and  clean glass, and in special cases should be boiled in situ.    A well-known German physicist (Warburg, I think) recommends putting  the seals under water, but I cannot think that this is a good plan,  for if air can get in, why not water?  which has its surface tension  in its favour.  The same reasoning prevents my recommending a layer of  sulphuric acid above the mercury-a method used for securing  air-tightness in \"mercury joints\" by Mr. Gimingham, Proc.  R.  S.  1874.    Further protection may be attained for many purposes by coating the  platinum wire with a sheath of glass, say half an inch long, fused to  the platinum wire to a depth of one-twentieth of an inch all round.    In some cases the electrodes must be expected to get very hot, for  instance, when it is desired to platinise mirrors by the device of  Professor Wright of Yale.  In this and similar cases I have met with  great success by using \"barometer\" tubes of about one-twelfth of an  inch bore, and with walls, say, one-tenth of an inch thick.  [Footnote: \"Barometer\" tube is merely very thick-walled glass tubing,  and makes particularly bad barometers, which are sold as weather  glasses.]    This tube is drawn down to a long point--say an inch long by  one-eighth of an inch external diameter, and the wire is fused in for  a length, say, of three-quarters of an inch, but only in the narrow  drawn--down part of the tube.  At different times I have tried four  such seals, and though the electrodes were red hot for hours, I have  never had an accident--of course they were well annealed.    Fig.  37.    For directions as to the making of high vacuum tubes, see the section  dealing with that matter.    Sec. 50.  As economy of platinum is often of importance, the following  little art will save money and trouble.  Platinum is easily caused to  join most firmly to copper--with which, I presume, it alloys--by the  following method.  Hold the platinum wire against the copper wire, end  to end, at the tip of the reducing flame of a typical blowpipe--or  anywhere--preferably in the \"reducing\" part of the oxygas flame;  in  a moment the metals will fuse together at the point of contact, when  they may be withdrawn.    Such a joint is very strong and wholly satisfactory, much better than  a soldered joint.  If the work is not carried out successfully so that  a considerable drop of copper-platinum alloy accumulates, cut it off  and start again.  The essence of success is speed, so that the copper  does not get \"burned.\" If any considerable quantity of alloy is formed  it dissolves the copper, and weakens it, so that we have first the  platinum wire, then a bead of alloy, and then a copper wire fused into  the bead, but so thin just outside the latter that the joint has no  mechanical strength.    Sec. 51.  The Art of making Air-light Joints.    Lamp-manufacturers and others have long since learned that when glass  is in question not only are fused joints made as easily as others, but  that they afford the only reliable form of joint.  An experimenter who  uses flint glass, has a little experience, an oxygas blow-pipe and a  blowing apparatus, will prefer to make his joints in this way, simply  from the ease with which it may be done.  When it comes to making a  tight joint between glass and other substances the problem is by no  means so easy.  Thus Mr. Griffiths (Phil.  Trans.  1893, p.  380)  failed to make air-tight joints by cementing glass"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22790"],[0,"The accomplisht cook (#14)"],[1,"water, put into the  broth some large mace and some sweet herbs bound up in a bundle,  a little rosemary, tyme, winter-savory, salt, and sweet marjoram,  bind them up very hard; and put in some raisins of the sun, some  good pruens, currans, and marigold-flowers; boil it up to an  indifferent thickness, and serve it on fine sippets; garnish the  dish with fruit and marigold-flowers, mace, lemon, and boil'd  marrow.
