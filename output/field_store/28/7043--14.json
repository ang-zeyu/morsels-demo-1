Even if it came to a spanking it was  only a farce. Grandma generally interposed a pillow between the palm  of her hand and the area of moral stimulation.    The real disciplinarian in our family was my father. Present or  absent, it was fear of his displeasure that kept us in the straight  and narrow path. In the minds of us children he was as much  represented, when away from home, by the strap hanging on the wall as  by his portrait which stood on a parlor table, in a gorgeous frame  adorned with little shells. Almost everybody's father had a strap, but  our father's strap was more formidable than the ordinary. For one  thing, it was more painful to encounter personally, because it was not  a simple strap, but a bunch of fine long strips, clinging as rubber.  My father called it noodles; and while his facetiousness was lost on  us children, the superior sting of his instrument was entirely  effective.    In his leisure, my father found means of instructing us other than by  the strap. He took us walking and driving, answered our questions, and  taught us many little things that our playmates were not taught.  From distant parts of the country he had imported little tricks of  speech and conduct, which we learned readily enough; for we were  always a teachable lot. Our pretty manners were very much admired, so  that we became used to being held up as models to children less  polite. Guests at our table praised our deportment, when, at the end  of a meal, we kissed the hands of father and mother and thanked them  for food. Envious mothers of rowdy children used to sneer, \"Those  grandchildren of Raphael the Russian are quite the aristocrats.\"        [Illustration: MY FATHER'S PORTRAIT]    And yet, off the stage, we had our little quarrels and tempests,  especially I. I really and truly cannot remember a time when Fetchke  was naughty, but I was oftener in trouble than out of it. I need not  go into details. I only need to recall how often, on going to bed, I  used to lie silently rehearsing the day's misdeeds, my sister  refraining from talk out of sympathy. As I always came to the  conclusion that I wanted to reform, I emerged from my reflections with  this solemn formula: \"Fetchke, let us be good.\" And my generosity in  including my sister in my plans for salvation was equalled by her  magnanimity in assuming part of my degradation. She always replied, in  aspiration as eager as mine, \"Yes, Mashke, let us be good.\"    My mother had less to do than any one with our early training, because  she was confined to the store. When she came home at night, with her  pockets full of goodies for us, she was too hungry for our love to  listen to tales against us, too tired from work to discipline us. It  was only on Sabbaths and holidays that she had a chance to get  acquainted with us, and we all looked forward to these days of  enjoined rest.    On Friday afternoons my parents came home early, to wash and dress and  remove from their persons every sign of labor. The great keys of the  store were put away out of sight; the money bag was hidden in the  featherbeds. My father put on his best coat and silk skull-cap; my  mother replaced the cotton kerchief by the well-brushed wig. We  children bustled around our parents, asking favors in the name of the  Sabbath--\"Mama, let Fetchke and me wear our new shoes, in honor of  Sabbath\"; or \"Papa, will you take us to-morrow across the bridge? You  said you would, on Sabbath.\" And while we adorned ourselves in our  best, my grandmother superintended the sealing of the oven, the maids  washed the sweat from their faces, and the dvornik scraped his feet at  the door.    My father and brother went to the synagogue, while we women and girls  assembled in the living-room for candle prayer. The table gleamed with  spotless linen and china. At my father's place lay the Sabbath loaf,  covered over with a crocheted doily; and beside it stood the wine  flask and _kiddush_ cup of gold or silver. At the opposite end of the  table was a long row of brass candlesticks, polished to perfection,  with the heavy silver candlesticks in a shorter row in front; for my  mother and grandmother were very pious, and each used a number of  candles; while Fetchke and I and the maids had one apiece.    After the candle prayer the women generally read in some book of  devotion, while we children amused ourselves in the quietest manner,  till the men returned from synagogue. \"Good Sabbath!\" my father  called, as he entered; and \"Good Sabbath! Good Sabbath!\" we wished him  in return. If he brought with him a Sabbath guest from the synagogue,  some poor man without a home, the stranger was welcomed and invited  in, and placed in the seat of honor, next to my father.    We all stood around the table while _kiddush_, or the blessing over  the wine, was said, and if a child whispered or nudged another my  father reproved him with a stern look, and began again from the  beginning. But as soon as he had cut the consecrated loaf, and  distributed the slices, we were at liberty to talk and ask questions,  unless a guest was present, when we maintained a polite silence.    Of one Sabbath guest we were always sure, even if no destitute Jew  accompanied my father from the synagogue. Yakub the choreman partook  of the festival with us. He slept on a bunk built over the entrance  door, and reached by means of a rude flight of steps. There he liked  to roll on his straw and rags, whenever he was not busy, or felt  especially lazy. On Friday evenings he climbed to his roost very  early, before the family assembled for supper, and waited for his cue,  which was the breaking-out of table talk after the blessing of the  bread. Then Yakub began to clear his throat and kept on working at it  until my father called to him to come down and have a glass of vodka.  Sometimes my father pretended not to hear him, and we smiled at one  another around the table, while Yakub's throat grew worse and worse,  and he began to cough and mutter and rustle in his straw. Then my  father let him come down, and he shuffled in, and stood clutching his  cap with both hands, while my father poured him a brimming glass of  whiskey. This Yakub dedicated to all our healths, and tossed off to  his own comfort. If he got a slice of boiled fish after his glassful,  he gulped it down as a chicken gulps worms, smacked his lips  explosively, and wiped his fingers on his unkempt locks. Then,  thanking his master and mistress, and scraping and bowing, he backed  out of the room and ascended to his roost once more; and in less time  than it takes to write his name, the simple fellow was asleep, and  snoring the snore of the just.    On Sabbath morning almost everybody went to synagogue, and those who  did not, read their prayers and devotions at home. Dinner, at midday,  was a pleasant and leisurely meal in our house. Between courses my  father led us in singing our favorite songs, sometimes Hebrew,  sometimes Yiddish, sometimes Russian, or some of the songs without  words for which the Hasidim were famous. In the afternoon we went  visiting, or else we took long walks out of town, where the fields  sprouted and the orchards waited to bloom. If we stayed at home, we  were not without company. Neighbors dropped in for a glass of tea.  Uncles and cousins came, and perhaps my brother's rebbe, to examine  his pupil in the hearing of the family. And wherever we spent the day,  the talk was pleasant, the faces were cheerful, and the joy of Sabbath  pervaded everything.    The festivals were observed with all due pomp and circumstance in our  house. Passover was beautiful with shining new things all through the  house; _Purim_ was gay with feasting and presents and the jolly  mummers; _Succoth_ was a poem lived in a green arbor; New-Year  thrilled our hearts with its symbols and promises; and the Day of  Atonement moved even the laughing children to a longing for  consecration. The year, in our pious house, was an endless song in  many cantos of joy, lamentation, aspiration, and rhapsody.    We children, while we regretted the passing of a festival, found  plenty to content us in the common days of the week. We had  everything we needed, and almost everything we wanted. We were  welcomed everywhere, petted and praised, abroad as well as at home. I  suppose no little girls with whom we played had a more comfortable  sense of being well-off than Fetchke and I. \"Raphael the Russian's  grandchildren\" people called us, as if referring to the quarterings in  our shield. It was very pleasant to wear fine clothes, to have kopecks  to spend at the fruit stalls, and to be pointed at admiringly. Some of  the little girls we went with were richer than we, but after all one's  mother can wear only one pair of earrings at a time, and our mother  had beautiful gold ones that hung down on her neck.    As we grew older, my parents gave us more than physical comfort and  social standing to rejoice in. They gave us, or set out to give us,  education, which was less common than gold earrings in Polotzk. For  the ideal of a modern education was the priceless ware that my father  brought back with him from his travels in distant parts. His travels,  indeed, had been the making of my father. He had gone away from  Polotzk, in the first place, as a man unfit for the life he led, out  of harmony with his surroundings, at odds with his neighbors. Never  heartily devoted to the religious ideals of the Hebrew scholar, he was  more and more a dissenter as he matured, but he hardly knew what he  wanted to embrace in place of the ideals he rejected. The rigid scheme  of orthodox Jewish life in the Pale offered no opening to any other  mode of life. But in the large cities in the east and south he  discovered a new world, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#14)"],[1,"of the great  slave-owners; and it cannot be explained except psychologically. The  Catholic type of Christianity was not merely an element, it was a  climate; and in that climate the slave would not grow. I have already  suggested, touching that transformation of the Roman Empire which was  the background of all these centuries, how a mystical view of man's  dignity must have this effect. A table that walked and talked, or a  stool that flew with wings out of window, would be about as workable a  thing as an immortal chattel. But though here as everywhere the spirit  explains the processes, and the processes cannot even plausibly explain  the spirit, these processes involve two very practical points, without  which we cannot understand how this great popular civilization was  created--or how it was destroyed.    What we call the manors were originally the _villae_ of the pagan  lords, each with its population of slaves. Under this process, however  it be explained, what had occurred was the diminishment of the lords'  claim to the whole profit of a slave estate, by which it became a claim  to the profit of part of it, and dwindled at last to certain dues or  customary payments to the lord, having paid which the slave could enjoy  not only the use of the land but the profit of it. It must be remembered  that over a great part, and especially very important parts, of the  whole territory, the lords were abbots, magistrates elected by a  mystical communism and themselves often of peasant birth. Men not only  obtained a fair amount of justice under their care, but a fair amount of  freedom even from their carelessness. But two details of the development  are very vital. First, as has been hinted elsewhere, the slave was long  in the intermediate status of a serf. This meant that while the land was  entitled to the services of the man, he was equally entitled to the  support of the land. He could not be evicted; he could not even, in the  modern fashion, have his rent raised. At the beginning it was merely  that the slave was owned, but at least he could not be disowned. At the  end he had really become a small landlord, merely because it was not the  lord that owned him, but the land. It is hardly unsafe to suggest that  in this (by one of the paradoxes of this extraordinary period) the very  fixity of serfdom was a service to freedom. The new peasant inherited  something of the stability of the slave. He did not come to life in a  competitive scramble where everybody was trying to snatch his freedom  from him. He found himself among neighbours who already regarded his  presence as normal and his frontiers as natural frontiers, and among  whom all-powerful customs crushed all experiments in competition. By a  trick or overturn no romancer has dared to put in a tale, this prisoner  had become the governor of his own prison. For a little time it was  almost true that an Englishman's house was his castle, because it had  been built strong enough to be his dungeon.    The other notable element was this: that when the produce of the land  began by custom to be cut up and only partially transmitted to the lord,  the remainder was generally subdivided into two types of property. One  the serfs enjoyed severally, in private patches, while the other they  enjoyed in common, and generally in common with the lord. Thus arose the  momentously important mediaeval institutions of the Common Land, owned  side by side with private land. It was an alternative and a refuge. The  mediaevals, except when they were monks, were none of them Communists;  but they were all, as it were, potential Communists. It is typical of  the dark and dehumanized picture now drawn of the period that our  romances constantly describe a broken man as falling back on the forests  and the outlaw's den, but never describe him as falling back on the  common land, which was a much more common incident. Mediaevalism  believed in mending its broken men; and as the idea existed in the  communal life for monks, it existed in the communal land for peasants.  It was their great green hospital, their free and airy workhouse. A  Common was not a naked and negative thing like the scrub or heath we  call a Common on the edges of the suburbs. It was a reserve of wealth  like a reserve of grain in a barn; it was deliberately kept back as a  balance, as we talk of a balance at the bank. Now these provisions for a  healthier distribution of property would by themselves show any man of  imagination that a real moral effort had been made towards social  justice; that it could not have been mere evolutionary accident that  slowly turned the slave into a serf, and the serf into a peasant  proprietor. But if anybody still thinks that mere blind luck, without  any groping for the light, had somehow brought about the peasant  condition in place of the agrarian slave estate, he has only to turn to  what was happening in all the other callings and affairs of humanity.  Then he will cease to doubt. For he will find the same mediaeval men busy  upon a social scheme which points as plainly in effect to pity and a  craving for equality. And it is a system which could no more be produced  by accident than one of their cathedrals could be built by an  earthquake.    Most work beyond the primary work of agriculture was guarded by the  egalitarian vigilance of the Guilds. It is hard to find any term to  measure the distance between this system and modern society; one can  only approach it first by the faint traces it has left. Our daily life  is littered with a debris of the Middle Ages, especially of dead words  which no longer carry their meaning. I have already suggested one  example. We hardly call up the picture of a return to Christian  Communism whenever we mention Wimbledon Common. This truth descends to  such trifles as the titles which we write on letters and postcards. The  puzzling and truncated monosyllable \"Esq.\" is a pathetic relic of a  remote evolution from chivalry to snobbery. No two historic things could  well be more different than an esquire and a squire. The first was above  all things an incomplete and probationary position--the tadpole of  knighthood; the second is above all things a complete and assured  position--the status of the owners and rulers of rural England  throughout recent centuries. Our esquires did not win their estates till  they had given up any particular fancy for winning their spurs. Esquire  does not mean squire, and esq. does not mean anything. But it remains on  our letters a little wriggle in pen and ink and an indecipherable  hieroglyph twisted by the strange turns of our history, which have  turned a military discipline into a pacific oligarchy, and that into a  mere plutocracy at last. And there are similar historic riddles to be  unpicked in the similar forms of social address. There is something  singularly forlorn about the modern word \"Mister.\" Even in sound it has  a simpering feebleness which marks the shrivelling of the strong word  from which it came. Nor, indeed, is the symbol of the mere sound  inaccurate. I remember seeing a German story of Samson in which he bore  the unassuming name of Simson, which surely shows Samson very much  shorn. There is something of the same dismal _diminuendo_ in the  evolution of a Master into a Mister.    The very vital importance of the word \"Master\" is this. A Guild was,  very broadly speaking, a Trade Union in which every man was his own  employer. That is, a man could not work at any trade unless he would  join the league and accept the laws of that trade; but he worked in his  own shop with his own tools, and the whole profit went to himself. But  the word \"employer\" marks a modern deficiency which makes the modern use  of the word \"master\" quite inexact. A master meant something quite other  and greater than a \"boss.\" It meant a master of the work, where it now  means only a master of the workmen. It is an elementary character of  Capitalism that a shipowner need not know the right end of a ship, or a  landowner have even seen the landscape, that the owner of a goldmine may  be interested in nothing but old pewter, or the owner of a railway  travel exclusively in balloons. He may be a more successful capitalist  if he has a hobby of his own business; he is often a more successful  capitalist if he has the sense to leave it to a manager; but  economically he can control the business because he is a capitalist,  not because he has any kind of hobby or any kind of sense. The highest  grade in the Guild system was a Master, and it meant a mastery of the  business. To take the term created by the colleges in the same epoch,  all the mediaeval bosses were Masters of Arts. The other grades were the  journeyman and the apprentice; but like the corresponding degrees at the  universities, they were grades through which every common man could  pass. They were not social classes; they were degrees and not castes.  This is the whole point of the recurrent romance about the apprentice  marrying his master's daughter. The master would not be surprised at  such a thing, any more than an M.A. would swell with aristocratic  indignation when his daughter married a B.A.    When we pass from the strictly educational hierarchy to the strictly  egalitarian ideal, we find again that the remains of the thing to-day  are so distorted and disconnected as to be comic. There are City  Companies which inherit the coats of arms and the immense relative  wealth of the old Guilds, and inherit nothing else. Even what is good  about them is not what was good about the Guilds. In one case we shall  find something like a Worshipful Company of Bricklayers, in which, it is  unnecessary to say, there is not a single bricklayer or anybody who has  ever known a bricklayer, but in which the senior partners of a few big  businesses in the City, with a few faded military men with a taste in  cookery, tell each other in after-din"]]]
