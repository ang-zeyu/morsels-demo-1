And the weather in those days nearly always permitted!    Most of the entries in her diary she made in this fair spot, alone,  but for the sympathetic presence of her big black dog. The morning  solitude was amply atoned for by the dozens of young friends who  joined the \"fruit parties\" every afternoon, filling the air with their  gay voices and wholesome, happy laughter.        [Illustration: THE SIX WILLOWS, HARMONY.]    Four or five young men and a bevy of beautiful young girls were  amongst the most constant visitors at Harmony. The girls, often  referred to in Hansie's diary as the \"Four Graces,\" were certainly the  most exquisite specimens of budding womanhood in Pretoria.    There was Consuelo, tall and slender, our languid \"Spanish beauty,\"  with her rich brown hair and slumbrous dark-brown eyes; there was our  little Marguerite, fresh and fair as the flower after which she was  named, an opening marguerite in the dewy daintiness of life's first  summer morning; there was Annie, spoilt and wilful but undoubtedly the  fairest of them all; and then there was her sister Sara, Hansie's  favourite, with a girlish charm impossible to describe. Her creamy  white complexion, her lovely soft brown eyes, her winning smile and  tender voice--what could be more delightful than to sit and watch her  as she moved and spoke with rare, unconscious grace, clad in a snowy  dress of fine white muslin!    One sweet summer morn, a Sabbath, if I remember correctly, when the  air was filled with the fragrance of innumerable buds and blossoms,  Hansie sat in the accustomed spot, with her diary on her lap. She was  not writing then, but, with a slip of paper in her hands and a gleam  of mischief in her eyes, she was repeating with evident enjoyment a  few catching lines.    \"Oh, Carlo, this is lovely! I must learn these verses and recite them  to the girls when they come this afternoon! Listen, Carlo.\"      FROM KITCHENER TO SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR    _Sunday_        I am taking measures once for all to clear my reputation;      I swear to give de Wet a fall that means annihilation.    _Monday_        A brilliant action by Brabant, the enemy has fled,      Their loss was something dreadful; ours--one single Kaffir dead.    _Tuesday_        De Wet is short of food-stuffs, his ammunition's done,      His horses are all dying, and he's only got one gun.    _Wednesday_        The cordon draws in round de Wet; he now has little room,      He only can escape one way--by road to Potchefstroom.    _Thursday_        De Wet is now caged like a rat, he's fairly in a box,      Around him grouped are Clements, Clery, Methuen, French, and Knox.    _Friday_        An unfortunate event occurred--I report it with regret,      A convoy with five hundred men was captured by de Wet.    _Saturday_        A Kaffir runner says he saw de Wet's men trekking west,      With ammunition for two years, and food supply the best.    _Saturday (later)_        A loyal farmer told our Scouts de Wet was riding east,      Each man, beside the horse he rode, was leading a spare beast.    Carlo wagged his tail sympathetically.           *       *       *       *       *    Overhead the sky was of the deepest, richest sapphire blue, paling  away to the horizon to the most delicate tints, against which the  distant hills showed up in bold relief.    \"Gentleman Jim,\" one of the native servants, was evidently enjoying  his Sunday too, for he loitered in the garden, plucking up a weed here  and there and watching the bees at work, the busy bees who know of no  day of rest.    \"Bring me some grapes, please, Jim,\" Hansie called out to him.    \"Yes, little missie,\" with alacrity. \"What you like? Them black ones  or them white ones?\"    \"Some of both.\"    He walked briskly to the house to fetch a basket and disappeared into  the vineyard, returning shortly with a plentiful supply of luscious  grapes.    \"Thank you, Jim. Enough for a week!\" Hansie laughed, and he looked  pleased as he went off in the direction of the river.    A few moments later, half concealed by the shrubs and rank grass with  which the lower part of Harmony was overrun, Hansie noticed two  stooping figures in khaki, moving forward cautiously and then making  sudden dashes at some object, invisible to the girl. She watched them  intently, wondering who the intruders were and what their game could  be, until they came so near that she was able to distinguish what it  was they nourished in their hands. Butterfly nets!    A pair of harmless Tommies, spending their Sunday morning in catching  butterflies and the other insects of which there abounded so large a  variety at that time of the year.    They did not catch sight of the girl until Carlo sprang up barking  furiously, and then they started back in consternation and surprise.    \"Lie down, Carlo,\" Hansie commanded sharply. \"Good morning,\" to the  men.    \"Good morning, miss,\" respectfully; \"I hope we are not intrudin'.\"    \"Certainly not. Are you catching butterflies? Show me what you have  got.\"    The men produced their spoil with pride.    \"Will you have some grapes?\" Hansie asked, handing the basket to one  of them, who helped himself gratefully and then passed it on to his  comrade. The latter, evidently not of a very sociable disposition,  took a bunch and walked off in pursuit of more butterflies.    The first soldier, however, squatted down on the ground at some little  distance from the girl and began to talk, as he ate the grapes with  great relish. At this point Carlo raised himself with the utmost  deliberation, yawned, stretched himself, and sauntering (I cannot call  it anything except _sauntering_) slowly towards his mistress, laid his  full length on the ground between her and the Tommy. Then he went  sound asleep to all appearances, but his mistress observed that when  the soldier made the slightest movement, the dog's ears twitched or an  eyelid quivered.    Slowly eating his grapes, the man glanced curiously at the book on  Hansie's lap.    \"Are you sketchin', miss?\" he asked.    \"No; writing.\"    \"Poetry?\"    There was no answer.    \"I am one of Lord Kitchener's body-guard,\" he went on presently. \"We  are encamped near Berea Park on the other side of your fence. We were  in Middelburg last week and I saw one of the Boer Generals, General  Botha.\"    Hansie's heart bounded. She looked at the man incredulously.    \"Indeed! How was that possible?\"    \"Quite simple, miss. Lord Kitchener invited the General into town to  have an interview with him. His brother--I think his name is  Christian--came with him. I acted as their orderly.\"    \"Tell me more, tell me everything,\" the girl's voice shook with  ill-controlled emotion.    \"There were five or six other men with them. They arrived at about  nine in the morning and stayed until half-past four that afternoon.  They had lunch with Lord Kitchener. A fine man the General is, well  set up, big and broad-shouldered.\"    \"Yes, I know.\" Hansie _could not_ withhold those words.    \"You know!\" he exclaimed in great surprise. \"Do _you_ know General  Botha?\"    \"Yes, indeed. And what is more, he is _my_ General.\"    The soldier looked at her in ludicrous amazement.    \"Are you a Boer? You don't look like one, and I never heard any one  speak better English.\"    \"I don't know whether what you are saying is meant as a compliment to  me, but I don't like being told that I don't look like a Boer, and I  certainly would not be pleased if you took me for an Englishwoman.\"    The poor Tommy looked troubled and muttered something about \"no  offence meant, I am sure.\"    \"Now please go on and tell me more about the General. Did you hear  anything of what he said to Lord Kitchener?\"    \"Nothing, miss, except when he went away. They shook hands very  hearty-like and the General said, 'Good-bye; I hope you will have good  luck.' That was all.\"    \"Good luck! What do you think he could have meant?\"    \"We don't know, miss, but we think he meant good luck in Natal, for  Lord Kitchener went yesterday and I hear there is some talk of peace.\"    Hansie sat silent for a long time, turning these things over in her  mind.    \"But what is all this accursed war about, miss? We soldiers know  nothing except that we have to fight when we are ordered to do so.\"    \"Of course you know nothing. An English soldier is nothing but a  fighting machine, not allowed to think or act for himself. Discipline  is a grand thing, but Heaven protect a man from the discipline of the  British army. The war? I will tell you if you want to know. The war is  a cruel and unjust attempt to rob us of our rich and independent land,  and England is the tool in base and unscrupulous hands. You suffer  too, I know, and all my heart goes out in sympathy to the bereaved and  broken-hearted Englishwomen across the seas. Their only comfort is  their firm belief that their heroes died a noble death for freedom and  justice. Did they but know the truth! They died to satisfy the lust  for gain and greed of gold of mining magnates on the Rand.\"    \"Suffer, miss! As long as I live I will not forget that march from the  colony, through Bloemfontein to Pretoria. Fighting nearly every day  and marching at least thirty miles a day, on _one biscuit_. There was  no water to be had! Will you believe that for three days not a drop of  water passed my lips? And I heard the other fellows say, not once, but  a thousand times, 'Would to God that a bullet find me before night!'  Our tongues were hanging from our mouths and our lips were  cracked----\"    \"Stop!\" Hansie cried, putting her hands to her ears. \"I do not want to  hear another word. These things cannot be helped, and your officers  suffered too!\"    \"The officers! When at last the water-carts came, we had to stand  aside and watch while bucketsful were being carried into the tents for  their _baths_!\"    There was silence again.    \"If I were an English"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#14)"],[1,"brutal and selfish, and  it was as natural that Esther should loathe him, as that she should  love Edward. Abhorred and circumvented as he was, old master, having the  power, very easily took revenge. I happened to see this exhibition of  his rage and cruelty toward Esther. The time selected was singular. It  was early in the morning, when all besides was still, and before any of  the family, in the house or kitchen, had left their beds. I saw but few  of the shocking preliminaries, for the cruel work had begun before I  awoke. I was probably awakened by the shrieks and piteous cries of poor  Esther. My sleeping place was on the floor of a little, rough closet,  which opened into the kitchen; and through the cracks of its unplaned  boards, I could distinctly see and hear what was going on, without being  seen by old master. Esther's wrists were firmly tied, and the twisted  rope was fastened to a strong staple in a heavy wooden joist above, near  the fireplace. Here she stood, on a bench, her arms tightly drawn over  her breast. Her back and shoulders were bare to the waist. Behind her  stood old master, with cowskin in hand, preparing his barbarous work  with all manner of harsh, coarse, and tantalizing epithets. The screams  of his victim were most piercing. He was cruelly deliberate, and  protracted the torture, as one who was delighted with the scene. Again  and again he drew the hateful whip through his hand, adjusting it with  a view of dealing the most pain-giving blow. Poor Esther had never yet  been severely whipped, and her shoulders{68} were plump and tender.  Each blow, vigorously laid on, brought screams as well as blood. _\"Have  mercy; Oh! have mercy\"_ she cried; \"_I won't do so no more;\"_ but her  piercing cries seemed only to increase his fury. His answers to them are  too coarse and blasphemous to be produced here. The whole scene, with  all its attendants, was revolting and shocking, to the last degree; and  when the motives of this brutal castigation are considered,--language  has no power to convey a just sense of its awful criminality. After  laying on some thirty or forty stripes, old master untied his suffering  victim, and let her get down. She could scarcely stand, when untied.  From my heart I pitied her, and--child though I was--the outrage kindled  in me a feeling far from peaceful; but I was hushed, terrified, stunned,  and could do nothing, and the fate of Esther might be mine next. The  scene here described was often repeated in the case of poor Esther, and  her life, as I knew it, was one of wretchedness.          CHAPTER VI. _Treatment of Slaves on Lloyd's Plantation_    EARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY--PRESENTIMENT OF ONE DAY BEING A  FREEMAN--COMBAT BETWEEN AN OVERSEER AND A SLAVEWOMAN--THE ADVANTAGES  OF RESISTANCE--ALLOWANCE DAY ON THE HOME PLANTATION--THE SINGING  OF SLAVES--AN EXPLANATION--THE SLAVES FOOD AND CLOTHING--NAKED  CHILDREN--LIFE IN THE QUARTER--DEPRIVATION OF SLEEP--NURSING CHILDREN  CARRIED TO THE FIELD--DESCRIPTION OF THE COWSKIN--THE ASH-CAKE--MANNER  OF MAKING IT--THE DINNER HOUR--THE CONTRAST.      The heart-rending incidents, related in the foregoing chapter, led me,  thus early, to inquire into the nature and history of slavery. _Why am I  a slave? Why are some people slaves, and others masters? Was there ever  a time this was not so? How did the relation commence?_ These were  the perplexing questions which began now to claim my thoughts, and to  exercise the weak powers of my mind, for I was still but a child,  and knew less than children of the same age in the free states. As my  questions concerning these things were only put to children a little  older, and little better informed than myself, I was not rapid in  reaching a solid footing. By some means I learned from these inquiries  that _\"God, up in the sky,\"_ made every body; and that he made _white_  people to be masters and mistresses, and _black_ people to be slaves.  This did not satisfy me, nor lessen my interest in the subject. I was  told, too, that God was good, and that He knew what was best for me, and  best for everybody. This was less satisfactory than the first statement;  because it came, point blank, against all my{70} notions of goodness.  It was not good to let old master cut the flesh off Esther, and make her  cry so. Besides, how did people know that God made black people to be  slaves? Did they go up in the sky and learn it? or, did He come down and  tell them so? All was dark here. It was some relief to my hard  notions of the goodness of God, that, although he made white men to be  slaveholders, he did not make them to be _bad_ slaveholders, and that,  in due time, he would punish the bad slaveholders; that he would, when  they died, send them to the bad place, where they would be \"burnt up.\"  Nevertheless, I could not reconcile the relation of slavery with my  crude notions of goodness.    Then, too, I found that there were puzzling exceptions to this theory  of slavery on both sides, and in the middle. I knew of blacks who were  _not_ slaves; I knew of whites who were _not_ slaveholders; and I knew  of persons who were _nearly_ white, who were slaves. _Color_, therefore,  was a very unsatisfactory basis for slavery.    Once, however, engaged in the inquiry, I was not very long in finding  out the true solution of the matter. It was not _color_, but _crime_,  not _God_, but _man_, that afforded the true explanation of the  existence of slavery; nor was I long in finding out another important  truth, viz: what man can make, man can unmake. The appalling darkness  faded away, and I was master of the subject. There were slaves here,  direct from Guinea; and there were many who could say that their fathers  and mothers were stolen from Africa--forced from their homes, and  compelled to serve as slaves. This, to me, was knowledge; but it was  a kind of knowledge which filled me with a burning hatred of slavery,  increased my suffering, and left me without the means of breaking away  from my bondage. Yet it was knowledge quite worth possessing. I could  not have been more than seven or eight years old, when I began to make  this subject my study. It was with me in the woods and fields; along the  shore of the river, and wherever my boyish wanderings led me; and though  I was, at that time,{71 EARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY} quite ignorant  of the existence of the free states, I distinctly remember being, _even  then_, most strongly impressed with the idea of being a freeman some  day. This cheering assurance was an inborn dream of my human nature a  constant menace to slavery--and one which all the powers of slavery were  unable to silence or extinguish.    Up to the time of the brutal flogging of my Aunt Esther--for she was  my own aunt--and the horrid plight in which I had seen my cousin from  Tuckahoe, who had been so badly beaten by the cruel Mr. Plummer, my  attention had not been called, especially, to the gross features of  slavery. I had, of course, heard of whippings and of savage _rencontres_  between overseers and slaves, but I had always been out of the way at  the times and places of their occurrence. My plays and sports, most of  the time, took me from the corn and tobacco fields, where the great body  of the hands were at work, and where scenes of cruelty were enacted and  witnessed. But, after the whipping of Aunt Esther, I saw many cases of  the same shocking nature, not only in my master's house, but on Col.  Lloyd's plantation. One of the first which I saw, and which greatly  agitated me, was the whipping of a woman belonging to Col. Lloyd, named  Nelly. The offense alleged against Nelly, was one of the commonest and  most indefinite in the whole catalogue of offenses usually laid to the  charge of slaves, viz: \"impudence.\" This may mean almost anything, or  nothing at all, just according to the caprice of the master or overseer,  at the moment. But, whatever it is, or is not, if it gets the name  of \"impudence,\" the party charged with it is sure of a flogging. This  offense may be committed in various ways; in the tone of an answer; in  answering at all; in not answering; in the expression of countenance; in  the motion of the head; in the gait, manner and bearing of the slave.  In the case under consideration, I can easily believe that, according to  all slaveholding standards, here was a genuine instance of impudence.  In Nelly there were all the necessary conditions for committing the  offense. She was{72} a bright mulatto, the recognized wife of a favorite  \"hand\" on board Col. Lloyd's sloop, and the mother of five sprightly  children. She was a vigorous and spirited woman, and one of the most  likely, on the plantation, to be guilty of impudence. My attention was  called to the scene, by the noise, curses and screams that proceeded  from it; and, on going a little in that direction, I came upon the  parties engaged in the skirmish. Mr. Siever, the overseer, had hold  of Nelly, when I caught sight of them; he was endeavoring to drag her  toward a tree, which endeavor Nelly was sternly resisting; but to  no purpose, except to retard the progress of the overseer's plans.  Nelly--as I have said--was the mother of five children; three of them  were present, and though quite small (from seven to ten years old, I  should think) they gallantly came to their mother's defense, and gave  the overseer an excellent pelting with stones. One of the little fellows  ran up, seized the overseer by the leg and bit him; but the monster was  too busily engaged with Nelly, to pay any attention to the assaults of  the children. There were numerous bloody marks on Mr. Sevier's face,  when I first saw him, and they increased as the struggle went on. The  imprints of Nelly's fingers were visible, and I was glad to see them.  Amidst the wild screams of the children--\"_Let my mammy go\"--\"let my  mammy go_\"--there escaped, from between the teeth of the bullet-headed  overseer, a"]]]
