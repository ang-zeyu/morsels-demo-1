Iulius Caesar  and C. Marcius Figulus to the consulship, I had an addition to my family  in the shape of a baby boy. Terentia doing well.    Why such a time without a letter from you? I have already written to you  fully about my circumstances. At this present time I am considering  whether to undertake the defence of my fellow candidate, Catiline.[55]  We have a jury to our minds with full consent of the prosecutor. I hope  that if he is acquitted he will be more closely united with me in the  conduct of our canvass; but if the result be otherwise I shall bear it  with resignation. Your early return is of great importance to me, for  there is a very strong idea prevailing that some intimate friends of  yours, persons of high rank, will be opposed to my election. To win me  their favour I see that I shall want you very much. Wherefore be sure to  be in Rome in January, as you have agreed to be.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: B.C. 62. Coss., D. Iunius Silanus, L. Licinius Murena.]         We have no letters to or from Cicero in the years B.C. 64 and       63,[56] partly, no doubt, because Atticus was in Rome a great deal       during these years. We take up the correspondence, therefore, after       an interval of two years, which in many respects were the most       important in Cicero's life. In B.C. 64 he attained his chief       ambition by being elected to the consulship, but we have little       trace of his public actions that year, only the fragments of one       speech remaining, in defence of Q. Gallius on a charge of       _ambitus_. The animus of the popular party, however, is shewn by       the prosecution of some surviving partisans of Sulla on charges of       homicide, among them Catiline, who by some means escaped conviction       (Dio, xxxvii. 10). In the year of the consulship (B.C. 63) some of       Cicero's most important speeches were delivered. The three on the       agrarian proposals of Rullus present him to us for the first time       as discussing an important question of home politics, the disposal       of the _ager publicus_, a question which had become again prominent       owing to the great additions made to it by the confiscations of       Sulla. He also defended C. Rabirius, prosecuted by Iulius Caesar for       the murder of Saturninus as long ago as B.C. 100, and later in the       year defended Murena on a charge of _ambitus_. Finally, the three       Catilinarian speeches illustrate the event which coloured the whole       of Cicero's life. In B.C. 62 his brother Quintus was praetor and       Cicero defended in his court P. Sulla, accused of complicity with       Catiline. On the 29th of December (B.C. 63) the tribune Q. Caecilius       Metellus Nepos prevented Cicero from making a speech when laying       down his consulship, and went on to propose summoning Pompey to       Rome, \"to protect the lives of the citizens.\" This led to scenes of       violence, and Metellus fled to Pompey, who reached Italy late in       the year B.C. 62 from the East.    [Footnote 55: Asconius assigns this to the accusation of embezzlement in  Africa. But that seems to have been tried in the previous year, or  earlier in this year. The new impeachment threatened seems to have been  connected with his crimes in the proscriptions of Sulla (Dio, xxxvii,  10). Cicero may have thought of defending him on a charge relating to so  distant a period, just as he did Rabirius on the charge of murdering  Saturninus (B.C. 100), though he had regarded his guilt in the case of  extortion in Africa as glaring.]    [Footnote 56: The essay on the duties of a candidate attributed to  Quintus is hardly a letter, and there is some doubt as to its  authenticity. I have therefore relegated it to an appendix.]          XII (F V, 7)    TO CN. POMPEIUS MAGNUS    ROME    _M. Tullius Cicero, son of Marcus, greets Cn. Pompeius, son of Cneius,  Imperator._      [Sidenote: B.C. 62. AET. 44]    If you and the army are well I shall be glad. From your official  despatch I have, in common with everyone else, received the liveliest  satisfaction; for you have given us that strong hope of peace, of which,  in sole reliance on you, I was assuring everyone. But I must inform you  that your old enemies--now posing as your friends--have received a  stunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in the high  hopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly depressed. Though your  private letter to me contained a somewhat slight expression of your  affection, yet I can assure you it gave me pleasure: for there is  nothing in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in the  consciousness of serving my friends; and if on any occasion I do not  meet with an adequate return, I am not at all sorry to have the balance  of kindness in my favour. Of this I feel no doubt--even if my  extraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to unite you to me--that  the interests of the state will certainly effect a mutual attachment and  coalition between us. To let you know, however, what I missed in your  letter I will write with the candour which my own disposition and our  common friendship demand. I did expect _some_ congratulation in your  letter on my achievements, for the sake at once of the ties between us  and of the Republic. This I presume to have been omitted by you from a  fear of hurting anyone's feelings. But let me tell you that what I did  for the salvation of the country is approved by the judgment and  testimony of the whole world. You are a much greater man than Africanus,  but I am not much inferior to Laelius either; and when you come home you  will recognize that I have acted with such prudence and spirit, that  you will not be ashamed of being coupled with me in politics as well as  in private friendship.          XIII (F V, I)    Q. METELLUS CELER TO CICERO    CISALPINE GAUL    _Q. Metellus Celer, son of Quintus, proconsul, greets M. Tullius  Cicero._[57]      [Sidenote: B.C. 62. AET. 44]    If you are well I am glad. I had thought, considering our mutual regard  and the reconciliation effected between us, that I was not likely to be  held up to ridicule in my absence, nor my brother attacked by you in his  civil existence and property for the sake of a mere word. If his own  high character was not a sufficient protection to him, yet either the  position of our family, or my own loyal conduct to you and the Republic,  ought to have been sufficient to support him. As it is, I see that he  has been ruined and I abandoned by the last people in the world who  ought to have done so. I am accordingly in sorrow and wearing mourning  dress, while actually in command of a province and army and conducting a  war. And seeing that your conduct in this affair has neither been  reasonable nor in accordance with the milder methods of old times, you  must not be surprised if you live to repent it. I did not expect to find  you so fickle towards me and mine. For myself, meanwhile, neither family  sorrow nor ill-treatment by any individual shall withdraw me from the  service of the state.    [Footnote 57: Q. Metellus Celer had been praetor in B.C. 63 and was now  (B.C. 62), as proconsul in Gallia Cisalpina, engaged against the remains  of the Catilinarian conspiracy. Meanwhile his brother (or cousin) Q.  Caecilius Metellus Nepos, a tribune, after trying in vain to bring Cicero  to trial for the execution of the conspirators, at last proposed to  summon Pompey to Rome to prevent danger to the lives of citizens. This  attempt led to riots and contests with Cato, and Nepos finally fled from  Rome to Pompey. By leaving Rome he broke the law as to the tribunes, and  the senate declared his office vacant, and this letter would even seem  to shew that the senate declared him a public enemy. This letter of  remonstrance is peremptory, if not insolent, in tone, and the reader  will observe that the formal sentences, dropped in more familiar  letters, are carefully used.]          XIV (F V, 2)    TO Q. METELLUS (IN CISALPINE GAUL)    ROME    _M. Tullius, son of Marcus, to Q. Metellus Celer, son of Quintus,  proconsul, wishes health._      [Sidenote: B.C. 62, AET. 44]    If you and the army are well I shall be glad. You say in your letter  that you \"thought, considering our mutual regard and the reconciliation  effected between us, that you were not likely to be held up to ridicule  by me.\" To what you refer I do not clearly understand, but I suspect  that you have been informed that, while arguing in the senate that there  were many who were annoyed at my having saved the state, I said that  your relations, whose wishes you had been unable to withstand, had  induced you to pass over in silence what you had made up your mind you  ought to say in the senate in my praise. But while saying so I also  added this--that the duty of supporting the Republic had been so divided  between us that I was defending the city from internal treachery and the  crime of its own citizens, you Italy from armed enemies and covert  conspiracy;[58] yet that this association in a task so noble and so  glorious had been imperilled by your relations, who, while you had been  complimented by me in the fullest and most laudatory terms, had been  afraid of any display of mutual regard on your part being put to my  credit. As this sentence betrayed how much I had looked forward to your  speech, and how mistaken I had been in that expectation, my speech  caused some amusement, and was received with a moderate amount of  laughter; but the laugh was not against you, it was rather at my  mistake, and at the open and _naive_ confession of my eagerness to be  commended by you.

THE TIMID ARE FRIGHTENED, THE  DANGEROUS KILLED, AND OTHERS PHOTOGRAPHED. MOVING PICTURES OF A RHINO  CHARGE      Down on the Tana River the rhinos are more common than in any  other known section of Africa. In two weeks we saw over one  hundred--perhaps two hundred--of them--so many, in fact, that one of the  chief diversions of the day was to count rhinos. One day we counted  twenty-six, another day nineteen, and by the time we left the district  rhinos had become such fixtures in the landscape as to cause only casual  comment. Perhaps there were some repeaters, ones that were counted  twice, but even allowing for that there were still some left. We saw big  ones and little ones, old ones and young ones, and middle-aged ones;  ones with long ears, short horns, double horns, and single horns; black  ones and red ones--in fact, all the kinds of rhinos that are resident in  British East Africa. One had an ear gone and another had a crook in his  tail. If we had stayed another week we might have got out a Tana River  Rhino Directory, with addresses and tree numbers. We studied them fore  and aft, from in front of trees and from behind them, from close range  and long range, over our shoulders, and through our cameras, every way  whereby a conscientious lover of life and nature can study a prominent  member of the Mammalia. We called the place Rhino Park because the  country looks like a beautiful park studded with splendid trees and  dotted with rhinos.    [Drawing: _A Morning Walk on the Tana River_]    When I went to Africa I was equipped with the following fund of  knowledge concerning the rhinoceros: First, that he is familiarly called  \"rhino\" by the daring hunters who have written about him; second, that  he is a member of the Perissodactyl family, whose sole representatives  are the horse, the rhino, and the tapir; third, that he savagely charges  human beings who write books about their thrilling adventures in Africa,  and, finally, that he looks like a hang-over from the pterodactyl age.  The books and magazine stories that have come out since Mr. Roosevelt  made African hunting the vogue invariably describe the rhino as being  one of the most dangerous of African animals. A charging rhino, a  wounded lion, a cape buffalo, and a frenzied elephant are the four  terrors of the African hunters. All other forms of danger are slight  compared with these, and I was full to the guards with a vast and  fearful respect for the rhino. I fancied myself spinning around like a  pinwheel with the horn of a rhino as a pivot, and the thought had little  to commend itself to a lover of longevity--such as myself, for instance.    [Photograph: A Comfortable Hammock of Zebra Skin]    [Photograph: Mrs. Akeley and Her Tana River Monkey]    After going to Africa and meeting some of the best members of the rhino  set I was able to form some conclusions of my own, chief of which is the  belief that he is dangerous only if he hits you. As long as you can keep  out of his reach you are in no great danger except from the thorns.    The prevailing estimate of the rhino is that he is an inoffensive  creature who likes to bask under the shade of a tree and watch the years  go parading by. His thick skin and fierce armament of horns seem to make  of him a relic of some long-forgotten age--the last survivor of the time  when mammoths and dinosauruses roamed the manless waste and time was  counted in geological terms instead of days and minutes. His eyes are  dimmed and he sees nothing beyond a few yards away, but his hearing and  sense of smell are keen, and he sniffs danger from afar in case danger  happens to be to windward of him. His sensitive nose is always alert for  foreign and, therefore, suspicious odors, and when he smells the blood  of an Englishman, or even an American, his tail goes up in anger, he  sniffs and snorts and races around in a circle while he locates the  direction where the danger lies--and then, look out. A blind, furious  rush which only a well-sped bullet can prevent causing the untimely end  of whatever happens to be in the way. That is the popular estimate of  the rhino.    [Drawing: _Popular Conception of Rhino_]    Here are some of the conclusions I have formed: If the hunter carefully  approaches the rhino from the leeward he may often come within a few  yards of the animal and might easily shoot him in a leisurely way. The  rhino can see only at close range and can smell only when the wind blows  the scent to him. Consequently he would be defenseless and at the mercy  of the hunter if it were not for one thing. Nature, in her wisdom, has  sent the little rhino bird to act as a sentinel for the great pachyderm.  These little birds live on the back of the rhino and, as recompense for  their vigilance, are permitted to partake of such ticks and insects as  inhabit the hide of their host. Whenever danger, or, in other words,  whenever a hunter tries to approach their own particular rhino from any  direction, windward, leeward, or any other way, the ever alert and  watchful rhino birds sound a tocsin of warning. The rhino pricks up his  ears and begins to show signs of taking notice. He doesn't know where or  what the danger may be, but he knows the C.Q.D. code of danger signals  as delivered to him from the outposts on his back and hastens to get  busy in an effort to locate the foe. As a general thing the little  birds, on sight of danger, begin a wild chatter, rising from the back of  the rhino and flying in an opposite direction from the danger. Then they  return, light on the rhino's back, and repeat, often several times, the  operation of flying away from the danger. If the rhino is a wise rhino  he learns from the birds which is the safe way to go and soon trots  swiftly off. In a measure the habits of the rhino bird are as  interesting as those of the rhino itself, and as an example of the weak  protecting the strong, the Damon and Pythias relationship between bird  and beast is without parallel in the animal kingdom.    [Drawing: _Before and After the Rhino Birds Give the Alarm_]    The rhino is a peaceful animal. He browses on herbs and shrubs and  dwells in friendly relationship with the rest of the animal kingdom.  Perhaps once or twice a day he ambles down to some favorite drinking  place for a drink, but the rest of the time he grazes along a hillside  or stands or lies sleepily under a tree. At such times as the latter he  may be approached quite near without much danger. Each day he also goes  to a favorite wallowing place, where he rolls in the red dirt and  emerges from this dirt bath a dull red rhino. In the rhino country  dozens of these red dirt rolling places may be found, each one trampled  smooth for an area of fifteen or twenty feet in evidence of the great  number of times it has been used by one or more rhinos. This dirt bath  is a defensive measure against the hordes of ticks that infest the  rhino. It is a subject for wonder that the six or eight tick birds do  not keep the rhino free of ticks, and it has even been argued by some  naturalists that the rhino bird does not eat ticks, but merely uses the  rhino as a convenient resting-place. Also perhaps they enjoy the ride.  We had planned to get a rhino bird and perform an autopsy on him in  order to analyze his contents, but did not do so.    [Photograph: The Ford of Tana River]    [Photograph: The Baby Rhino]    After the rhino has taken his dirt wallow, and looks fine in his new red  coat, he then slowly and painstakingly proceeds to kill time during the  rest of the day. If danger threatens he becomes exceedingly nervous and  excited. His anxiety is quite acute. In vain he tries to locate the  danger, rushing one way for a few yards, then the other way, and finally  all ways at once. His tail is up and he is snorting like a steam engine.  When he rushes toward you in this attitude it looks very much as though  he were charging you with the purpose of trampling you to flinders. As a  matter of fact, or, rather, opinion, he is merely trying to locate where  you are in order that he may run the other way. He looks terrifying, but  in reality is probably badly terrified himself. He would give a good  deal to know which way to run, and finally becomes so excited and  nervous that he starts frantically in some direction, hoping for the  best. If this rush happens to be in your direction you call it a charge  from an infuriated rhino; if not, you say that he looked nasty and was  about to charge, but finally ran away in another direction. In most  rhino charges it is my opinion that the rhino is too rattled to know  what he is doing, and, instead of charging maliciously, he is merely  trying to get away as fast as possible. And in such cases the hunter  blazes away at him, wounds him, and the rhino blindly charges the flash.    [Drawing: _Trying to Provoke a Charge_]    It was our wish to get moving pictures of a rhino charge. Mr. Akeley had  a machine and our plan of action was simple. We would first locate the  rhino, usually somnolent under a thorn tree or browsing soberly out in  the open. We would then get to the leeward of him and slowly advance the  machine; Mr. Akeley in the middle and Stephenson and I on each side with  our double-barreled cordite rifles. In case the charge became too  serious to escape we hoped to be able to turn him or kill the rhino with  our four bullets. If we were unsuccessful in doing so--well, we had to  manage the situation by jumping.    Our first experience was most thrilling, chiefly because we expected a  charge. We thought all rhinos charged, as per the magazine articles, and  so "]]]
