The graft is such cases may be  said to inclose the stock in a tube of its own substance, leaving the  stock unaffected otherwise. The variegated shoot in this case was in  reality derived from the downward growth of the graft and not from the  original stock, which was not therefore contaminated by the graft. In  cases where the stock is of much slower growth than the graft, or the  graft is inserted upon a stock of some other species, the descending  cambium does not inclose the stock, but makes layers of wood on the stem  of the graft, which thus, as is frequently seen, overgrows the stock,  sometimes to such an extent as to make it unsightly. Nobody ever saw an  apple shoot from a crab stock, a pear from a quince stock, or a peach  shoot from a plum stock. This is one of the arguments in favor of the  view that cambium also rises from the roots.    Again, to show that the stock is not affected by the graft, or the graft  by the stock, except as to root power, let any person graft a white beet  upon a red beet, or contrariwise, when about the size of a goosequill,  and when they have attained their full growth, by dividing the beet  lengthwise he will find the line of demarkation between the colors  perfectly distinct, neither of them running into the other.    The theory that leaf variegation is a disease has been held by many  distinguished botanists and is in nowise new. But this theory has been  controverted, and we think successfully, by other botanists, and it is  not now accepted by the more advanced vegetable physiologists. There are  now so many acute and industrious students and observers in every  department of science, and the accumulation of facts is so rapid and so  great, that very many of the older theories are being set aside as not  in accord with the newly discovered facts. A student brought up in  institutions where the old theories are inculcated has afterward to  spend half his time in unlearning what he had been previously taught,  and the other half in studying the new facts brought to his notice and  testing the theories promulgated by men of science. Botanical science  does not wholly consist in the classification and nomenclature of  plants, but largely consists in a knowledge of vegetable anatomy and  physiology, and these require much study and some knowledge of other  sciences, such as chemistry, meteorology, geology, etc. Without such  general knowledge it is difficult to form a harmonious theory in regard  to any of the phenomena of plant life.           *       *       *       *       *          VANILLA, CINNAMON, COCOANUT.      The following interesting facts concerning the cultivation of the above  products in the island of Ceylon, were given in Mr. H. B. Brady's recent  address before the British Pharmaceutical Conference at Swansea:    The vanilla plant is trained on poles placed about twelve or eighteen  inches apart--one planter has a line of plants about three miles in  length. Like the cardamom, it yields fruit after three years, and then  continues producing its pods for an indefinite period.    The cinnamon (_Cinnamomum zeylanicum_) is, as its name indicates, a  native of Ceylon. It is cultivated on a light sandy soil about three  miles from the sea, on the southwest coast of the island, from Negumbo  to Matura. In its cultivated state it becomes really productive after  the sixth year, and continues from forty to sixty years. The  superintendent of the largest estate in this neighborhood stated that  there were not less than fifteen varieties of cinnamon, sufficiently  distinct in flavor to be easily recognized. The production of the best  so injures the plants that it does not pay to cut this at any price  under 4s. 6d. to 5s. per lb. The estate alluded to above yields from  30,000 to 40,000 lb. per annum; a uniform rate of 41/2 d. per lb. of  finished bark is paid for the labor. Cinnamon oil is produced from this  bark by distillation; the mode is very primitive and wasteful. About 40  lb. of bark, previously macerated in water, form one charge for the  still, which is heated over a fire made of the spent bark of a previous  distillation. Each charge of bark yields about three ounces of oil, and  two charges are worked daily in each still.    The cultivation of the cocoanut tree and the production of the valuable  cocoanut oil are two important Cingalese occupations. These trees, it  appears, do not grow with any luxuriance at a distance from human  dwellings, a fact which may perhaps be accounted for by the benefit they  derive from the smoke inseparable from the fires in human habitations.  The cultivation of cocoanuts would seem to be decidedly profitable, as  some 4,000 nuts per year are yielded by each acre, the selling price  being L3 per thousand, while the cost of cultivation is about L2 per  acre. In extracting the oil, the white pulp is removed and dried,  roughly powdered, and pressed in similar machinery to the linseed oil  crushing mills of this country. The dried pulp yields about 63 per cent  by weight of limpid, colorless oil, which in our climate forms the white  mass so well known in pharmacy.           *       *       *       *       *          LEARNING TO TIE KNOTS.      A correspondent suggests that it would be a handy accomplishment for  schoolboys to be proficient in the handling, splicing, hitching, and  knotting of ropes. He suggests the propriety of having the art taught in  our public schools. A common jackknife and a few pieces of clothes line  are the main appliances needed to impart the instruction with. He  concludes it would not only be of use in ordinary daily life, but  especially to those who handle merchandise and machinery. Any one, he  adds, who has noticed the clumsy haphazard manner in which boxes and  goods are tied for hoisting or for loading upon trucks, will appreciate  the advantage of practical instruction in this direction. Probably a  good plan, he further suggests, would be to have one schoolboy taught  first by the master, and then let the pupil teach the other boys. Our  correspondent thinks most boys would consider it a nice pastime to  practice during recess and at the dinner hour, so that no time would be  taken from study or recitation time.           *       *       *       *       *          DECISIONS RELATING TO PATENTS.      Supreme Court of the United States    PEARCE _vs._ MULFORD _et al._    Appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern  District of New York.    1. Reissued patent No. 5,774 to Shubael Cottle, February 24, 1874, for  improvement in chains for necklaces, declared void, the first claim, if  not for want of novelty, for want of patentability, and the second for  want of novelty.    2. Neither the tubing, nor the open spiral link formed of tubing, nor  the process of making either the open or the closed link, nor the  junction of closed and open spiral links in a chain, was invented by the  patentee.    3. All improvement is not invention and entitled to protection as such.  Thus to entitle it it must be the product of some exercise of the  inventive faculties, and it must involve something more than what is  obvious to persons skilled in the art to which it relates.    The decree of the circuit court is therefore reversed, and it is ordered  that the bill be dismissed.      BY THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS.    DICKSON vs. KINSMAN.--INTERFERENCE.--TELEPHONE.    The subject matter of the interference is defined in the preliminary  declaration thereof as follows:    The combination in one instrument of a transmitting telephone and a  receiving telephone, so arranged that when the mouthpiece of the  speaking or transmitting telephone is applied to the mouth of a person,  the orifice of the receiving telephone will be applied to his ear.    1. While it is true that the unsupported allegations of an inventor,  that he conceived an invention at a certain date, are not sufficient to  establish such fact, the testimony of a party that he constructed and  used a device at a certain time is admissible.    2. Abandonment is an ill-favored finding, which cannot be presumed, but  must be conclusively proven.    The decision of the Board of Examiners-in-Chief is reversed, and  priority awarded to Dickson.           *       *       *       *       *          CHARACTERISTICS OF ARCTIC WINTER.      Lieutenant Schwatka, whose recent return from a successful expedition in  search of the remains of Sir John Fanklin's ill-fated company, combats  the prevalent opinion that the Arctic winter, especially in the higher  latitudes, is a period of dreary darkness.    In latitude 83 deg. 20' 20\" N., the highest point ever reached by man, there  are four hours and forty-two minutes of twilight on December 22, the  shortest day in the year, in the northern hemisphere. In latitude 82 deg.  27' N., the highest point where white men have wintered, there are six  hours and two minutes in the shortest day; and latitude 84 deg. 32' N., 172  geographical miles nearer the North Pole than Markham reached, and 328  geographical miles from that point, must yet be attained before the true  Plutonic zone, or that one in which there is no twilight whatsoever,  even upon the shortest day of the year, can be said to have been entered  by man. Of course, about the beginning and ending of this twilight, it  is very feeble and easily extinguished by even the slightest mists, but  nevertheless it exists, and is quite appreciable on clear cold days, or  nights, properly speaking. The North Pole itself is only shrouded in  perfect blackness from November 13 to January 29, a period of  seventy-seven days. Supposing that the sun has set (supposing a  circumpolar sea or body of water unlimited to vision) on September 24,  not to rise until March 18, for that particular point, giving a period  of about fifty days of uniformly varying twilight, the pole has about  188 days of continuous daylight, 100 days of varying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#14)"],[1,"they had all been about  catholic emancipation, but she did not see that so much had come of it  as yet. The college scout declared himself much troubled for the king's  conscience, observing that if we make an oath at baptism, we ought to  hold by it. 'The bed-makers,' Gladstone writes home, 'seem to continue  in a great fright, and mine was asking me this morning whether it would  not be a very good thing if we were to give them [the Irish] a king and  a parliament of their own, and so to have no more to do with them. The  old egg-woman is no whit easier, and wonders how Mr. Peel, who was  always such a well-behaved man here, can be so foolish as to think of  letting in the Roman catholics.' The unthinking and the ignorant of all  classes were much alike. Arthur Hallam went to see _King John_ in 1827,  and he tells his friend how the lines about the Italian priest (Act III.  Sc. 1) provoked rounds of clapping, while a gentleman in the next box  cried out at the top of his voice, 'Bravo! Bravo! No Pope!' The same  correspondent told Gladstone of the father of a common Eton friend, who  had challenged him with the overwhelming question, 'Could I say that any  papist had ever at any time done any good to the world?' A still  stormier conflict than even the emancipation of the catholics was now to  shake Oxford and the country to the depths, before Mr. Gladstone took  his degree.                                         II                               OXFORD FRIENDSHIPS    His friendships at Oxford Mr. Gladstone did not consider to have been as  a rule very intimate. Principal among them were Frederick Rogers, long  afterwards Lord Blachford; Doyle; Gaskell; Bruce, afterwards Lord Elgin;  Charles Canning, afterwards Lord Canning; the two Denisons; Lord  Lincoln. These had all been his friends at Eton. Among new acquisitions  to the circle of his intimates at one time or another of his Oxford  life, were the two Aclands, Thomas and Arthur; Hamilton, afterwards  Bishop of Salisbury; Phillimore, destined to close and life-long  friendship; F. D. Maurice, then of Exeter College, a name destined to  stir so many minds in the coming generation. Of Maurice, Arthur Hallam  had written to Gladstone (June 1830) exhorting him to cultivate his  acquaintance. 'I know many,' says Hallam, 'whom Maurice has moulded like  a second nature, and these too, men eminent for intellectual power, to  whom the presence of a commanding spirit would in all other cases be a  signal rather for rivalry than reverential acknowledgment.' 'I knew  Maurice well,' says Mr. Gladstone in one of his notes of reminiscence,  'had heard superlative accounts of him from Cambridge, and really strove  hard to make them all realities to myself. One Sunday morning we walked  to Marsh Baldon to hear Mr. Porter, the incumbent, a calvinist  independent of the _clique_, and a man of remarkable power as we both  thought. I think he and other friends did me good, but I got little  solid meat from him, as I found him difficult to catch and still more  difficult to hold.'    Sidney Herbert, afterwards so dear to him, now at Oriel, here first  became an acquaintance. Manning, though they both read with the same  tutor, and one succeeded the other as president of the Union, he did not  at this time know well. The lists of his guests at wines and breakfasts  do not even contain the name of James Hope; indeed, Mr. Gladstone tells  us that he certainly was not more than an acquaintance. In the account  of intimates is the unexpected name of Tupper, who, in days to come,  acquired for a time a grander reputation than he deserved by his  _Proverbial Philosophy_, and on whom the public by and by avenged its  own foolishness by severer doses of mockery than he had earned.[39] The  friend who seems most to have affected him in the deepest things was  Anstice, whom he describes to his father (June 4, 1830) as 'a very  clever man, and more than a clever man, a man of excellent principle and  of perfect self-command, and of great industry. If any circumstances  could confer upon me the inestimable blessing of fixed habits and  unremitting industry, these [the example of such a man] will be they.'  The diary tells how, in August (1830), Mr. Gladstone conversed with  Anstice in a walk from Oxford to Cuddesdon on subjects of the highest  importance. 'Thoughts then first sprang up in my soul (obvious as they  may appear to many) which may powerfully influence my destiny. O for a  light from on high! I have no power, none, to discern the right path for  myself.' They afterwards had long talks together, 'about that awful  subject which has lately almost engrossed my mind.' Another  day--'Conversation of an hour and a half with Anstice on practical  religion, particularly as regards our own situation. I bless and praise  God for his presence here.' 'Long talk with Anstice; would I were more  worthy to be his companion.' 'Conversation with Anstice; he talked much  with Saunders on the motive of actions, contending for the love of God,  _not_ selfishness even in its most refined form.'[40]                          EVANGELICAL IN RELIGION    In the matter of his own school of religion, Mr. Gladstone was always  certain that Oxford in his undergraduate days had no part in turning him  from an evangelical into a high churchman. The tone and dialect of his  diary and letters at the time show how just this impression was. We find  him in 1830 expressing his satisfaction that a number of Hannah More's  tracts have been put on the list of the Christian Knowledge Society. In  1831 he bitterly deplores such ecclesiastical appointments as those of  Sydney Smith and Dr. Maltby, 'both of them, I believe, regular  latitudinarians.' He remembered his shock at Butler's laudation of  Nature. He was scandalised by a sermon in which Calvin was placed upon  the same level among heresiarchs as Socinus and other like aliens from  gospel truth. He was delighted (March 1830) with a university sermon  against Milman's _History of the Jews_, and hopes it may be useful as an  antidote, 'for Milman, though I do think without intentions directly  evil, does go far enough to be justly called a bane. For instance, he  says that had Moses never existed, the Hebrew nation would have remained  a degraded pariah tribe or been lost in the mass of the Egyptian  population--and this notwithstanding the promise.' In all his letters in  the period from Eton to the end of Oxford and later, a language noble  and exalted even in these youthful days is not seldom copiously streaked  with a vein that, to eyes not trained to evangelical light and to minds  not tolerant of the expansion that comes to religious natures in the  days of adolescence, may seem unpleasantly strained and excessive. The  fashion of such words undergoes transfiguration as the epochs pass. Yet  in all their fashions, even the crudest, they deserve much tenderness.  He consults a clergyman (1829) on the practice of prayer meetings in  his rooms. His correspondent answers, that as the wicked have their  orgies and meet to gamble and to drink, so they that fear the Lord  should speak often to one another concerning Him; that prayer meetings  are not for the cultivation or exhibition of gifts, nor to enable noisy  and forward young men to pose as leaders of a school of prophets; but if  a few young men of like tastes feel the withering influence of mere  scholastic learning, and the necessity of mutual stimulation and  refreshment, then such prayer meetings would be a safe and natural  remedy. The student's attention to all religious observances was close  and unbroken, the most living part of his existence.    The movement that was to convulse the church had not yet begun. 'You may  smile,' Mr. Gladstone said long after, 'when told that when I was at  Oxford, Dr. Hampden was regarded as a model of orthodoxy; that Dr.  Newman was eyed with suspicion as a low churchman, and Dr. Pusey as  leaning to rationalism.' What Mr. Gladstone afterwards described as a  steady, clear, but dry anglican orthodoxy bore sway, 'and frowned this  way or that, on the first indication of any tendency to diverge from the  beaten path.'[41] He hears Whately preach a controversial sermon (1831)  just after he had been made Archbishop of Dublin. 'Doubtless he is a man  of much power and many excellences, but his anti-sabbatical doctrine is,  I fear, as mischievous as it is unsound.' A sermon of Keble's at St.  Mary's prompts the uneasy question, 'Are all Mr. Keble's opinions those  of scripture and the church? Of his life and heart and practice, none  could doubt, all would admire.' A good sermon is mentioned from Blanco  White, that strange and forlorn figure of whom in later life Mr.  Gladstone wrote an interesting account, not conclusive in argument, but  assuredly not wanting in either delicacy or generosity.[42] 'Dr. Pusey  was very kind to me when I was an undergraduate at Oxford,' he says, but  what their relations were I know not. 'I knew and respected both Bishop  Lloyd and Dr. Pusey,' he says, 'but neither of them attempted to  exercise the smallest influence over my religious opinions.' With Newman  he seems to have been brought into contact hardly at all.[43] Newman  and one of the Wilberforces came to dine at Cuddesdon one day, and, on a  later occasion, he and another fellow of Oriel were at a dinner with Mr.  Gladstone at the table of his friend Philip Pusey. Two or three of his  sermons are mentioned. One of them (March 7, 1831) contained 'much  singular, not to say objectionable matter, if one may so speak of so  good a man.' Of another,--'heard Newman preach a good sermon on those  who made excuse' (Sept. 25, 1831). Of the generality of university  sermons, he accepted the observation of his friend Anstice,--'Depend  upon it, such sermons as those can never convert a single person.' On  some Sundays he hears two of these discourses in the morning and"]]]
