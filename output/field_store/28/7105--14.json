Because you deni'd this suit to me, and gave 't    To such a creature.      PESCARA.             Do you know what it was?    It was Antonio's land; not forfeited    By course of law, but ravish'd from his throat    By the cardinal's entreaty.  It were not fit    I should bestow so main a piece of wrong    Upon my friend; 'tis a gratification    Only due to a strumpet, for it is injustice.    Shall I sprinkle the pure blood of innocents    To make those followers I call my friends    Look ruddier upon me?  I am glad    This land, ta'en from the owner by such wrong,    Returns again unto so foul an use    As salary for his lust.  Learn, good Delio,    To ask noble things of me, and you shall find    I 'll be a noble giver.      DELIO.                   You instruct me well.      ANTONIO.

'Tis a noble old fellow.      DELIO.  What course do you mean to take, Antonio?      ANTONIO.  This night I mean to venture all my fortune,    Which is no more than a poor ling'ring life,    To the cardinal's worst of malice.  I have got    Private access to his chamber; and intend    To visit him about the mid of night,    As once his brother did our noble duchess.    It may be that the sudden apprehension    Of danger,--for I 'll go in mine own shape,--    When he shall see it fraight[123] with love and duty,    May draw the poison out of him, and work    A friendly reconcilement.  If it fail,    Yet it shall rid me of this infamous calling;    For better fall once than be ever falling.      DELIO.

If 't please your lordship; but he 's instantly    To take the air here in the gallery    By my direction.      PESCARA.          Pray thee, what 's his disease?      DOCTOR.  A very pestilent disease, my lord,    They call lycanthropia.      PESCARA.                 What 's that?    I need a dictionary to 't.      DOCTOR.                     I 'll tell you.    In those that are possess'd with 't there o'erflows    Such melancholy humour they imagine    Themselves to be transformed into wolves;    Steal forth to church-yards in the dead of night,    And dig dead bodies up:  as two nights since    One met the duke 'bout midnight in a lane    Behind Saint Mark's church, with the leg of a man    Upon his shoulder; and he howl'd fearfully;    Said he was a wolf, only the difference    Was, a wolf's skin was hairy on the outside,    His on the inside; bade them take their swords,    Rip up his flesh, and try.  Straight I was sent for,    And, having minister'd to him, found his grace    Very well recover'd.      PESCARA.  I am glad on 't.      DOCTOR.                     Yet not without some fear    Of a relapse.

'Tis your shadow.      FERDINAND.  Stay it; let it not haunt me.      MALATESTI.  Impossible, if you move, and the sun shine.      FERDINAND.  I will throttle it.         [Throws himself down on his shadow.]      MALATESTI.  O, my lord, you are angry with nothing.      FERDINAND.  You are a fool:  how is 't possible I should catch    my shadow, unless I fall upon 't?  When I go to hell, I mean    to carry a bribe; for, look you, good gifts evermore make way    for the worst persons.      PESCARA.  Rise, good my lord.      FERDINAND.  I am studying the art of patience.      PESCARA.  'Tis a noble virtue.      FERDINAND.

Now let me come to him.--Are you mad, my lord? are you out    of your princely wits?      FERDINAND.              What 's he?      PESCARA.                             Your doctor.      FERDINAND.  Let me have his beard saw'd off, and his eye-brows    fil'd more civil.      DOCTOR.  I must do mad tricks with him, for that 's the only way    on 't.--I have brought your grace a salamander's skin to keep    you from sun-burning.      FERDINAND.  I have cruel sore eyes.      DOCTOR.  The white of a cockatrix's[126] egg is present remedy.      FERDINAND.  Let it be a new-laid one, you were best.    Hide me from him:  physicians are like kings,--    They brook no contradiction.      DOCTOR.  Now he begins to fear me:  now let me alone with him.      CARDINAL.  How now! put off your gown!      DOCTOR.  Let me have some forty urinals filled with rosewater:    he and I 'll go pelt one another with them.--Now he begins to fear    me.--Can you fetch a frisk,[127] sir?--Let him go, let him go, upon    my peril:  I find by his eye he stands in awe of me; I 'll make him    as tame as a dormouse.      FERDINAND.  Can you fetch your frisks, sir!--I will stamp him into    a cullis,[128] flay off his skin to cover one of the anatomies[129]    this rogue hath set i' th' cold yonder in Barber-Chirurgeon's-hall.    --Hence, hence! you are all of you like beasts for sacrifice.

Knows your grace    What accident hath brought unto the prince    This strange distraction?      CARDINAL.  [Aside.] I must feign somewhat.--Thus they say it grew.    You have heard it rumour'd, for these many years    None of our family dies but there is seen    The shape of an old woman, which is given    By tradition to us to have been murder'd    By her nephews for her riches.  Such a figure    One night, as the prince sat up late at 's book,    Appear'd to him; when crying out for help,    The gentleman of 's chamber found his grace    All on a cold sweat, alter'd much in face    And language:  since which apparition,    He hath grown worse and worse, and I much fear    He cannot live.

Still more necessary is it that a similar  course should be taken by the British South Africa Company and by the  Imperial Government, in whose territories there still survive more of  the great beasts. It is to be hoped that even the lion and some of the  rare lynxes will ultimately receive consideration. Noxious as they are,  it would be a pity to see them wholly exterminated. When I was in India,  in the year 1888, I was told that there were only seven lions then left  in that vast area, all of them well cared for. The work of slaughter  ought to be checked in South Africa before the number gets quite so low  as this, and though there may be difficulties in restraining the natives  from killing the big game, it must be remembered that as regards many  animals it is the European rather than the native, who is the chief  agent of destruction.    The predatory creatures which are now most harmful to the farmer are  the baboons, which infest rocky districts and kill the lambs in such  great numbers that the Cape government offers bounties for their  slaughter. But no large animal does mischief for a moment comparable to  that of the two insect plagues which vex the eastern half of the  country, the white ants and the locusts. Of these I shall have something  to say later.          CHAPTER IV    VEGETATION      The flora of South Africa is extremely rich, showing a number of genera,  and of species which, in proportion to its area, exceeds the number  found in most other parts of the world. But whether this wealth is due  to the diversity of physical conditions which the country presents, or  rather to geological causes, that is, to the fact that there may at some  remote period have been land connections with other regions which have  facilitated the immigration of plants from various sides, is a matter on  which science cannot yet pronounce, for both the geology and the flora  of the whole African continent have been very imperfectly examined. It  is, however, worth remarking that there are marked affinities between  the general character of the flora of the south-western corner of South  Africa and that of the flora of south-western Australia, and similar  affinities between the flora of south-eastern and tropical Africa and  the flora of India, while the relations to South America are fewer and  much less marked. This fact would seem to point to the great antiquity  of the South Atlantic Ocean.    To give in such a book as this even the scantiest account of the plants  of South Africa would obviously be impossible. All I propose is to  convey some slight impression of the part which its vegetation, and  particularly its trees, play in the landscape and in the economic  conditions of the country. Even this I can do but imperfectly, because,  like most travellers, I passed through large districts in the dry  season, when three-fourths of the herbaceous plants are out of flower.    No part of the country is richer in beautiful flowers than the immediate  neighbourhood of Cape Town. This extreme south-western corner of Africa  has a climate of the south temperate zone; that is to say, it has a real  summer and a real winter, and gets most of its rain in winter, whereas  the rest of South Africa has only a wet season and a dry season, the  latter coming in winter. So, too, this corner round Cape Town has a  vegetation characteristically its own, and differing markedly from that  of the arid Karroo regions to the north, and that of the warm  subtropical regions in the east of the Colony and in Natal. It is here  that the plants flourish which Europeans and Americans first came to  know and which are still to them the most familiar examples of the South  African flora. Heaths, for instance, of which there are said to be no  less than three hundred and fifty species in this small district, some  of extraordinary beauty and brilliance, are scarcely found outside of  it. I saw two or three species on the high peaks of Basutoland, and  believe some occur as far north as the tropic on the tops of the  Quathlamba Range; but in the lower grounds, and even on the plateau of  the Karroo they are absent. The general aspect of the vegetation on the  Karroo, and eastward over the plateau into Bechuanaland and the  Transvaal, is to the traveller's eye monotonous--a fact due to the  general uniformity of the geological formations and the general dryness  of the surface. In Natal and in Mashonaland types different from those  of either the Cape or the Karroo appear, and I have never seen a more  beautiful and varied alpine flora than on a lofty summit of Basutoland  which I ascended in early summer. But even in Mashonaland, and in  Matabililand still more, the herbaceous plants make, at least in the  dry season, comparatively little show. I found the number of conspicuous  species less than I had expected, and the diversity of types from the  types that prevail in the southern part of the plateau (in Bechuanaland  and the Orange Free State) less marked. This is doubtless due to the  general similarity of the conditions that prevail over the plateau.  Everywhere the same hot days and cold nights, everywhere the same  dryness.    However, I must avoid details, especially details which would be  interesting only to a botanist, and be content with a few words on those  more conspicuous features of the vegetation which the traveller notes,  and which go to make up his general impression of the country.    Speaking broadly, South Africa is a bare country, and this is the more  remarkable because it is a new country, where man has not had time to  work much destruction. There are ancient forests along the south coast  of Cape Colony and Natal, the best of which are (in the former colony)  now carefully preserved and administered by a Forest Department of  Government. Such is the great Knysna forest, where elephants still roam  wild. But even in these forests few trees exceed fifty or sixty feet in  height, the tallest being the so-called yellow-wood, and the most useful  the sneeze-wood. On the slopes of the hills above Graham's Town and King  William's Town one finds (besides real forests here and there) immense  masses of dense scrub, or \"bush,\" usually from four to eight feet in  height, sometimes with patches of the prickly-pear, an invader from  America, and a formidable one; for its spines hurt the cattle and make  passage by men a troublesome business. It was this dense, low scrub  which constituted the great difficulty of British troops in the fierce  and protracted Kafir wars of fifty years ago; for the ground which the  scrub covers was impassable except by narrow and tortuous paths known  only to the natives, and it afforded them admirable places for ambush  and for retreat. Nowadays a large part of the bush-covered land is used  for ostrich-farms, and it is, indeed, fit for little else. The scrub is  mostly dry, while the larger forests are comparatively damp, and often  beautiful with flowering trees, small tree-ferns, and flexile climbers.  But the trees are not lofty enough to give any of that dignity which a  European forest, say in England or Germany or Norway, often possesses,  and as the native kinds are mostly evergreens, their leaves have  comparatively little variety of tint. One of the most graceful is the  curious silver-tree, so called from the whitish sheen of one side of its  leaves, which grows abundantly on the slopes of Table Mountain, but is  found hardly anywhere else in the Colony.    If this is the character of the woods within reach of the coast rains,  much more conspicuous is the want of trees and the poorness of those  scattered here and there on the great interior plateau. In the desert  region, that is to say, the Karroo, the northern part of Cape Colony to  the Orange River, western Bechuanaland, and the German territories of  Namaqualand and Damaraland, there are hardly any trees, except small,  thorny mimosas (they are really acacias, the commonest being _Acacia  horrida_), whose scanty, light-green foliage casts little shade. On the  higher mountains, where there is a little more moisture, a few other  shrubs or small trees may be found, and sometimes beside a watercourse,  where a stream runs during the rains, the eye is refreshed by a few  slender willows; but speaking generally, this huge desert, one-third of  South Africa, contains nothing but low bushes, few of which are fit even  for fuel. Farther east, where the rainfall is heavier, the trees, though  still small, are more frequent and less thorny. Parts of the great plain  round Kimberley were tolerably well wooded thirty years ago, but the  trees have all been cut down to make mine props or for fire-wood. North  of Mafeking the rolling flats and low hills of Bechuanaland are pretty  fairly wooded, and so to a less degree are the adjoining parts of the  Transvaal and Matabililand. The road going north from Mafeking passes  through some three hundred miles of such woodlands, but a less beautiful  or interesting woodland I have never seen. The trees are mostly the  thorny mimosas I have mentioned. None exceed thirty, few reach  twenty-five, feet. Though they grow loosely scattered, the space between  them is either bare or occupied by low and very prickly bushes. The  ground is parched, and one can get no shade, except by standing close  under a trunk somewhat thicker than its neighbours. Still farther north  the timber is hardly larger, though the general aspect of the woods is  improved by the more frequent occurrence of flowering trees, some  sweet-scented, with glossy leaves and small white flowers, some with  gorgeous clusters of blossoms. Three are particularly handsome. One,  usually called the Kafir-boom, has large flowers of a brilliant crimson.  Another (_Lonchocarpus speciosus_[4]), for which no English name seems  to exist, shows lovely pendulous flowers of a bluish lilac, resembling  in colour"]]]
