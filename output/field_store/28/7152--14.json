This was a great insult, for none but wicked women were forbidden to  appear; and, as Hipparchus had thus publicly disgraced the girl, her  brother was very angry.    His friend, Aristogiton, was as angry as he; and the two young men,  consulting together, decided that as long as these men ruled, the  Athenians would be treated badly, and that it would be well to get rid  of them soon.          XXXVIII. DEATH OF THE CONSPIRATORS.      Harmodius and Aristogiton, having decided to get rid of the tyrants,  told their plans to a few of their friends. Secret meetings were held at  the house of a brave lady called Le-ae'na (\"the lioness\"), who was the  only woman in the plot.    As the Athenians were in the habit of attending the feast in armor, the  young men waited until then to carry out their plans. They mingled with  the crowd, found a good place near the tyrants, and all at once drew  their swords from their scabbards and attacked their enemies.    Harmodius was so quick that he managed to kill Hipparchus; but, before  his companions could join and protect him, he was cut down by the  tyrants' guards.    Aristogiton, his friend, rushed forward to save him, but was made  prisoner, and dragged before Hippias, who bade him tell the names of his  companions. The young man at first refused to speak; but after a while,  pretending to yield, he named some of the tyrants' friends who were  helping him oppress the Athenians.    The tyrant, in dismay, sent for the accused, and had them and  Aristogiton killed without trial. When he found out his mistake, he  again tried to learn the names of the real conspirators. He knew that  Harmodius and Aristogiton had often visited Leaena: so he had her  imprisoned and tortured, to make her tell the names of the conspirators,  because he wanted to kill them all as he had killed Aristogiton.    The brave woman, knowing that the lives of several young men depended  upon her, and that a single word might cause their death, resolved not  to utter a sound. In spite of the most awful tortures, she therefore  kept her mouth tightly closed; and when she was finally set free, they  found that she had bitten off her tongue for fear of betraying her  friends.    Poor Leaena did not live long after this; and when she died, she was  buried in a beautiful tomb, over which her friends put the image of a  lioness without a tongue, to remind the people of her courage.    The Athenians were very sorry for her death, and mourned the brave  youths Harmodius and Aristogiton for a long time; but the tyranny of the  son of Pisistratus daily grew more cruel and disagreeable.          XXXIX. HIPPIAS DRIVEN OUT OF ATHENS.      Four years passed thus, and the Athenians were hoping that the time  would soon come when they could get rid of Hippias. They were only too  glad, therefore, when they at last found a way to drive him out of the  town.    [Illustration: Delphi.]    You must remember how Megacles had killed the men who came out of  Athene's temple clinging to the cord they had fastened to her statue.  Megacles, as you know, had been banished from Athens with all his family  (the Alcmaeonidae) on account of this crime, but he had always hoped to be  allowed to return.    Meanwhile the beautiful temple at Delphi had been burned to the ground,  and the people were very anxious to rebuild it. They therefore voted a  certain sum of money for this purpose; and, as the Alcmaeonidae offered  to do the work for the least pay, the contract was given to them.    The Alcmaeonidae faithfully carried out the plans, and used the money;  but, instead of building the temple of brick, they made it of pure white  marble, paying for the more costly material themselves.    The priests of Delphi were so pleased with the handsome new building,  and with the generosity of the builders, that they were eager to do them  a good turn. So, knowing that the Alcmaeonidae wanted to get back to  Athens, they told the Spartans who came to consult the oracle, that  Hippias should be driven away, and the Alcmaeonidae allowed to return to  their native city.    As the people believed all the oracle said, the Spartans armed at once,  and, helped by the Alcmaeonidae, began to make war against the Athenians.  By a clever trick, they soon managed to capture the family of Hippias,  and they refused to set them free unless the tyrant left Athens forever.    Thus forced to give in, Hippias left Athens, and withdrew with his  family to Asia Minor. Here he spent all his time in trying to persuade  the different cities to make war against Athens, offering to lead their  armies, for he still hoped to regain his lost power.    The Athenians, delighted at the expulsion of the Pis-is-trat'i-dae, as  the driving-away of Hippias and his family is called in history, now  dared to make statues in honor of their favorites Harmodius and  Aristogiton, and openly expressed their regret that these brave young  men had not lived to see their native city free.    Many songs were composed to celebrate the patriotism of the two  friends; and these were sung on all public occasions, to encourage other  youths to follow their example, lead good and virtuous lives, and be  ready at any time to die, if need be, for the sake of their native land.    Leaena, too, received much praise, for the Athenian women never forgot  how bravely she had endured torture rather than betray the men who had  trusted her.    The Alcmaeonidae, having thus found their way back into the city, now  began to play an important part in the government; and Clis'the-nes,  their leader, urged the Athenians to obey again the laws which had been  made by Solon.    These were slightly changed, however, so as to give more power to the  people; and the government thus became more democratic than ever. Then,  too, Clisthenes said that there should always be ten Athenian generals  who should hold supreme command each for a day in turn.    He also made a law, to the effect that no man should be driven out of  the city unless there were six thousand votes in favor of his exile.  These votes were given in a strange way.    When a man was so generally disliked that his departure seemed best, all  the Athenians assembled in the market place. Then each voter received a  shell (Greek, _ostrakon_), and dropped it into a place made for that  purpose. All in favor of banishment wrote upon their shells the name of  the man they wished to exile. The others left theirs blank.    When all the votes had thus been cast, the shells were carefully  counted, and, if six thousand bore the name of the same man, he was  driven out of the city, or ostracized, as it was called from the name of  the shell, for ten years.          XL. THE GREAT KING.      Hippias, the exiled tyrant of Athens, as we have already seen, had taken  up his abode in Asia Minor, where he made several unsuccessful attempts  to regain his power.    The Greek cities were not ready to help him, however, so he tried to get  another ally. Now, the greatest ruler in Asia Minor was Da-ri'us, the  king who won his throne by the aid of his horse and groom, as you will  see in ancient history.    He was a powerful monarch,--so powerful that the Greeks, who had built  cities all along the coast of Asia Minor, in the country called Ionia,  never spoke of him except as \"The Great King.\"    Darius' kingdom was so large that it was quite impossible for one person  to govern it without help. He therefore divided it into satrapies, or  provinces, each of which was under the care of a satrap, or governor.  These men received their orders from the king, saw that they were obeyed  in all the territory under their care, and kept Darius informed of all  that was going on.    The Great King generally dwelt at Ec-bat'a-na, a city surrounded by  seven walls, each painted in a different but very bright color. Inside  the seventh and last wall stood the palace and treasure house, which was  fairly overflowing with gold and precious stones.    As there were armed soldiers at every gate in the seven walls, only the  people to whom the king was willing to grant an audience could enter.    Now, although so secluded, Darius knew perfectly well all that was  happening in every part of his kingdom, and even in the neighboring  states; for his satraps sent him messengers daily to report all the  news, and he had many paid spies, whose duty it was to tell him all they  knew.    He was therefore one of the first Eastern rulers who heard of the revolt  of the Athenians; and soon after this he learned that Hippias had come  to Asia, and was trying to induce the Greek cities to make war against  the Athenians.    When Hippias arrived at Ecbatana in search of aid, he could not  immediately see the king, but was obliged to send in a message written  on a waxen tablet. This passed from hand to hand, and finally reached  Darius, who, recognizing the name at the bottom of the request,  graciously said that he would receive the exiled tyrant of Athens.          XLI. HIPPIAS VISITS DARIUS.      Hippias was led by one of the officers of the king's household past all  the guards, who respectfully made way for him, and was brought into the  most magnificent dwelling he had ever seen. All the walls were covered  with silken hangings of the richest dyes, and the furniture sparkled  with gold and precious stones.    After passing through many rooms, where he saw richly dressed courtiers,  and guards with jeweled weapons, Hippias was finally brought into a  great audience chamber, at one end of which hung a heavy curtain of  royal purple.    Here all the courtiers knelt, bending over to touch the floor with their  foreheads, in token of homage to The Great King. The officer now bade  Hippias do likewise; and when the Athenian raised his head, after  reluctantly going through this performance, he saw that the curtain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#14)"],[1,"for my neighbour's shanty, which I could see about  three mile off, an', in a hour or so, I wur at his door.

It was that singular trait in the character of predatory  animals, as the cougar, when under circumstances of danger.  On such  occasions fear seems to influence them so much as to completely subdue  their ferocity, and they will not molest other animals sharing the  common danger, even when the latter are their natural and habitual prey.  Nearly every one of us had observed this at some time or other; and the  old naturalist, as well as the hunter-guides, related many incidents  confirming the strange fact.  Humboldt speaks of an instance observed by  him on the Orinoco, where the fierce jaguar and some other creatures  were seen quietly and peacefully floating together on the same log--all  more or less frightened at their situation!    Ike's story had very much interested the doctor, who rewarded him with a  \"nip\" from the pewter flask; and, indeed, on this occasion the flask was  passed round, as the day had been one of unusual interest.  The killing  of a cougar is a rare adventure, even in the wildest haunts of the  backwoods' country.        CHAPTER NINE.    THE MUSQUASH.    Our next day's march was unenlivened by any particular incident.  We had  left behind us the heavy timber, and again travelled through the \"oak  openings.\"  Not an animal was started during the whole day, and the only  one seen was a muskrat that took to the water of a small creek and  escaped.  This occurred at the spot where we had halted for our  night-camp, and after the tents were pitched, several of the party went  \"rat-hunting.\"  The burrow of a family of these curious little animals  was discovered in the bank, and an attempt was made to dig them out, but  without success.  The family proved to be \"not at home.\"    The incident, however, brought the muskrat on the _tapis_.    The \"muskrat\" of the States is the musquash of the fur-traders (_Fiber  sibethicus_).  He is called muskrat, from his resemblance to the common  rat, combined with the musky odour which he emits from glands situated  near the anus.  Musquash is said to be an Indian appellative--a strange  coincidence, as the word, \"musk\" is of Arabic origin, and \"musquash\"  would seem a compound of the French _musque_, as the early Canadian  fur-traders were French, or of French descent, and fixed the  nomenclature of most of the fur-bearing animals of that region.  Naturalists have used the name of \"Musk Beaver\" on account of the many  points of resemblance which this animal bears to the true beaver  (_Castor fiber_).  Indeed, they seem to be of the same genus, and so  Linnaeus classed them; but later systematists have separated them, for  the purpose, I should fancy, not of simplifying science, but of creating  the impression that they themselves were very profound observers.    The teeth--those great friends of the closet naturalist, which help him  to whole pages of speculation--have enabled him to separate the beaver  from the musquash, although the whole history and habits of these  creatures prove them to be congeners, as much as a mastiff is the  congener of a greyhound--indeed, far more.  So like are they in a  general sense, that the Indians call them \"cousins.\"    In form the muskrat differs but little from the beaver.  It is a thick,  rounded, and flat-looking animal, with blunt nose, short ears almost  buried in the fur, stiff whiskers like a cat, short legs and neck, small  dark eyes, and sharply-clawed feet.  The hinder ones are longest, and  are half-webbed.  Those of the beaver are full-webbed.    There is a curious fact in connection with the tails of these two  animals.  Both are almost naked of hair, and covered with \"scales,\" and  both are flat.  The tail of the beaver, and the uses it makes of this  appendage, are things known to every one.  Every one has read of its  trowel-shape and use, its great breadth, thickness, and weight, and its  resemblance to a cricket-bat.  The tail of the muskrat is also naked,  covered with scales, and compressed or flattened; but instead of being  horizontally so, as with the beaver, it is the reverse; and the thin  edges are in a vertical plane.  The tail of the former, moreover, is not  of the trowel-shape, but tapers like that of the common rat.  Indeed,  its resemblance to the house-rat is so great as to render it a somewhat  disagreeable object to look upon.    Tail and all, the muskrat is about twenty inches in length; and its body  is about half as big as that of a beaver.  It possesses a strange power  of contracting its body, so as to make it appear about half its natural  size, and to enable it to pass through a chink that animals of much  smaller dimensions could not enter.    Its colour is reddish-brown above, and light-ash underneath.  There are  eccentricities, however, in this respect.  Specimens have been found  quite black, as also mixed and pure white.  The fur is a soft, thick  down, resembling that of the beaver, but not quite so fine.  There are  long rigid hairs, red-coloured, that overtop the fur; and these are also  sparely scattered over the tail.    The habits of the muskrat are singular--perhaps not less so than those  of his \"cousin\" the beaver, when you strip the history of the latter of  its many exaggerations.  Indeed the former animal, in the domesticated  state, exhibits much greater intelligence than the latter.    Like the beaver, it is a water animal, and is only found where water  exists; never among the dry hills.  Its \"range\" extends over the whole  continent of North America, wherever \"grass grows and water runs.\"  It  is most probable it is an inhabitant of the Southern Continent, but the  natural history of that country is still but half told.    Unlike the beaver, the race of the muskrat is not likely soon to become  extinct.  The beaver is now found in America, only in the remotest parts  of the uninhabited wilderness.  Although formerly an inhabitant of the  Atlantic States, his presence there is now unknown; or, if occasionally  met with, it is no longer in the beaver dam, with its cluster of social  domes, but only as a solitary creature, a \"terrier beaver,\"  ill-featured, shaggy in coat, and stunted in growth.    The muskrat, on the contrary, still frequents the settlements.  There is  hardly a creek, pond, or watercourse, without one or more families  having an abode upon its banks.  Part of the year the muskrat is a  social animal; at other seasons it is solitary.  The male differs but  little from the female, though he is somewhat larger, and better furred.    In early spring commences the season of his loves.  His musky odour is  then strongest, and quite perceptible in the neighbourhood of his haunt.  He takes a wife, to whom he is for ever after faithful; and it is  believed the connection continues to exist during life.  After the  \"honeymoon\" a burrow is made in the bank of a stream or pond; usually in  some solitary and secure spot by the roots of a tree, and always in such  a situation that the rising of the water cannot reach the nest which is  constructed within.  The entrance to this burrow is frequently under  water, so that it is difficult to discover it.  The nest within is a bed  of moss or soft grasses.  In this the female brings forth five or six  \"cubs,\" which she nourishes with great care, training them to her own  habits.  The male takes no part in their education; but during this  period absents himself, and wanders about alone.  In autumn the cubs are  nearly full-grown, and able to \"take care of themselves.\"  The \"old  father\" now joins the family party, and all together proceed to the  erection of winter quarters.  They forsake the \"home of their nativity,\"  and build a very different sort of a habitation.  The favourite site for  their new house, is a swamp not likely to freeze to the bottom, and if  with a stream running through it, all the better.  By the side of this  stream, or often on a little islet in the midst, they construct a  dome-shaped pile, hollow within, and very much like the house of the  beaver.  The materials used are grass and mud, the latter being obtained  at the bottom of the swamp or stream.  The entrance to this house is  subterranean, and consists of one or more galleries debouching under the  water.  In situations where there is danger of inundation, the floor of  the interior is raised higher, and frequently terraces are made to admit  of a dry seat, in "]]]
