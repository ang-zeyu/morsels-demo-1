[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#14)"],[1," a fearful thing it would be for a man who  has enjoyed that blessing to lose it altogether, if that were possible;  to be told, \"You must not pray!  God will not hear your prayers!  From  henceforth you must have no communion with the Most High!\"  The thought  has just occurred to me as I have been speaking of this our first night  on our new location.    We, of course, gave water to our sheep and penned them carefully before  lying down to rest.  We knew that we had not so many enemies to guard  against as there are in many countries; but still there were some.  First, there were dingoes, or native dogs, who play the part of wolves  as well as foxes, in Australia, by attacking sheepfolds and poultry  yards: they were certain in an out-station to visit us.  Then we were  told there were natives who might very likely come in the night to steal  a fat sheep, or to attack us if they could find us unprepared; and  lastly, there were some bush-rangers already abroad--ruffians who had  escaped from road-gangs, and not being able to return to the settlement,  lived a wild, desperate life in the bush, and procured their stores by  plundering drays coming up from Port Jackson, or out-stations where they  thought anything was to be got.  However, as none had been heard of for  some time, we had no apprehensions about them.    We were too strong a party to invite attack, and only a very hungry, and  therefore desperate man, would think of molesting us.  Still, it was  prudent for one to remain on watch.  Charley White took the first watch,  as he had done at sea.  Peter was to take the second.  I heard Charley  call him up, but not feeling disposed to sleep myself, I told him to  rest on, as I knew that he was very tired, and that I would look out  instead.  I took a gun in my hand, and walked round and round our little  camp.  There was no moon, but the stars were very bright, proving the  clearness of the atmosphere.  Now and then I stopped and gazed up at  them, admiring their beauty, and thinking how greatly increased must be  our powers of comprehension before we should understand all about them.  I must have been standing thus silent and quiet for some time, when,  casting my eyes down on the earth, I thought I saw an object moving  slowly among some brushwood or scrub at a little distance.  I stood  still a minute longer, and just as I was moving the creature came out of  the scrub.  It was a dingo, I had little doubt of that; I was on the  point of lifting my gun to my shoulder to fire, when probably seeing me,  it ran quickly back.  I instantly went after it, hoping to get a fair  shot at the other side of the scrub, which was but a small patch of  underwood.  I felt sure that he would go through it, and followed.  I  worked my way along--no difficult matter where the scrub is open, as it  generally is out here--and once more caught sight of the creature  stealing cautiously away at no great distance.  They are cunning beasts,  those dingoes.  Often I have knocked one over, and left him for dead,  when after a little time, turning round, I have seen him stealing off;  but the moment he saw that he was observed, dropping down and looking as  dead as before.  I was sure that I should hit the dingo and prevent him  coming again to visit our sheep; so I raised my gun to fire.  At that  instant I received a blow on the side of my head, which would have  brought me to the ground had its strength not been broken by a bough.  My hand was on the trigger, and I fired my gun.  A man stood before me,  and closing, attempted to wrench the weapon out of my hand.  I had too  firm a hold of it, however, for I was a stronger man than he.  He was  active though, and tried all sorts of ways to get the better of me.  Finding that he could not succeed, he uttered several coos--a sound  heard a long way in the bush, and just then coming into use among the  settlers.  Again he closed with me, so that I could not strike him with  my gun, while he tried with his legs to trip me up.  I thought that it  was now high time for me to cry out; so I shouted at the top of my  voice, as loud as if I was hailing a ship at sea in a gale of wind.  It  rather astonished my friend, I suspect; especially when I dropped my  gun, and seizing him in my arms, lifted him off the ground.  He begged  me to let him go.  \"No, no,\" I answered, \"you wanted to rob me; but you  find that you have caught a Tartar, and I shall not release you till you  give an account of yourself.\"  The cooing had been heard by the man's  companions, for just as I had mastered him, two men appeared coming out  of the wood which covered the hill under which we had camped.  My  assailant saw them, and began to struggle to free himself from me; but  starvation and rough living had weakened him.  Still it was hard work to  get him along while he struggled in the hope that his comrades would  come to his assistance.  They were getting very near indeed, when I  heard a shout close to me, and as the bush-rangers were darting towards  me, Charley, Peter, the other boys, and Dick Nailor came rushing up from  the other side.    The two bush-rangers took to flight, leaving their companion in our  power.    \"You have got the better of me, I must own!\" he exclaimed.  \"Perhaps you  will not believe me when I say that all I wanted was your gun and  ammunition.  If I had got that I might have demanded some food, for I am  starving, but I did not wish to harm you or any one else.\"    \"A curious way you took to prove that, by trying to knock me down,\" I  answered, as Dick Nailor relieved me of the charge of the man, by taking  hold of his collar and one arm and forcing him onwards.    \"Come along with us to our camp, and we shall learn more about you.\"    The man said nothing in return, and he felt that in the grasp of the  giant resistance was useless.    We quickly reached the camp, where we found Bob Hunt trying to comfort  my wife and daughters, who had been much alarmed at hearing the shot  fired and finding me absent.    By the light of the lantern held to the prisoner's face we saw that he  was pale and haggard, that his hair was long and uncombed, and that a  razor had not touched his chin or lips for many a day; while his clothes  were rudely patched, and even thus hardly hung together.  Thus we could  not but believe the account he gave of his hunger and suffering--indeed,  I had heard that most of the men who had taken to the bush soon died of  starvation, or were killed by the blacks.    We quickly put some biscuits and cheese before our prisoner.  He ate of  it ravenously, giving way occasionally to an hysterical laugh.  His eyes  sparkled when I gave him some rum and water.  I saw that he required a  stimulant, and I would not allow him to take any more solid food.  Compassion for the poor wretch predominated above any other feeling.    It was useless to inquire what circumstances had brought him to that  condition.  Sin was the cause of it, of course; but he required help,  and, in spite of his attack on me, I felt that it ought to be given him.    While he was eating, it struck me that I was well acquainted with his  countenance.    After looking again and again, I felt nearly sure that I was right,  strange as it seemed; and grateful I was that I had not in our struggle  taken his life or injured him.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    OUR PRISONER.    We kept a strict watch over our wretched prisoner.  For his own sake I  did not wish him to escape, and, far from having an intention of  delivering him up to justice, my earnest desire was to try and reclaim  him.  I think that, under the circumstances, I should have acted as I  did had he been an indifferent person; but I felt sure, from the  peculiarity of his features, that he was the youngest son of my kind old  patron and friend, Mr Wells.  Often in his childhood had he sat on my  knee when I came home from sea, and often he had listened attentively to  the accounts of my adventures.  He was a pretty, interesting little  fellow.  As he grew up he altered very much; became disobedient to his  parents, and ultimately growing wilder and wilder, went, as the  expression is, to the bad.  For some years I had not even heard of him.    Worn out with fatigue, our prisoner slept on till after the sun was up,  and we were busy in marking out the ground for our slate hut, and making  preparations for cutting down the nearest trees with which to build it.  More than once I looked at his countenance while he slept, and called my  wife to look at him.  We were both convinced that my surmise was  correct.    On awaking at last he gazed round with an astonished, puzzled look, and  sighed deeply.  I happened to be near, and went up to him.    \"Arthur!\"  I said, gently, \"what brought you here?\"    \"What!--Who are you?--How do you know me?\" he exclaimed, springing to  his feet.  \"I'll answer you though--my own folly and vice and sin.  I am  in your power.  I did not wish to take your life, but I hoped to get  your gun and then to force you to give me and my mates food--that was  all.  You may, however, take me into camp and deliver me up to the  governor and his men; if they hang me at once I shall be grateful to  you, for I am weary of this life.  I am a mere slave to my mates; they  would murder me in an instant if I should become burdensome to them;  and, bad as I am, they are so much worse that I can even now have no  fellowship with them.\"    Thus the unhappy man ran on, eagerly discharging, as it were, at once  his long pent-up feelings and thoughts.  For weeks and months he had  been wandering about, nearly starved, and ill-treated and despised by  his companions in crime.  And this man had been in the rank of a  gentleman, and had been educated as one, and had once felt as one!  I  know to a certainty that there are numbers of such wandering about the  world, and others who have died miserably,--outcasts from their friends  and, more terrible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#14)"],[1,"fo' he make his skuse en  start fer ter go.    \"'You better Stay en take a snack wid me, Brer Fox,' sez Brer  Rabbit, sezee.

Brer Rabbit, he hail 'im:    \"'Howdy, Brer B'ar!'    \"Brer B'ar, he look 'roun en bimeby he see Brer Rabbit swingin'  fum de saplin', en he holler out:    \"'Heyo, Brer Rabbit! How you come on dis mawnin'?'    \"'Much oblije, I'm middlin', Brer B'ar,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"Den Brer B'ar, he ax Brer Rabbit w'at he doin' up dar in de  elements, en Brer Rabbit, he up'n say he makin' dollar minnit.

MR. BEAR CATCHES OLD MR. BULL-FROG    \"WELL, Uncle Remus,\" said the little boy, counting to see if he  hadn't lost a marble somewhere, \"the Bear didn't catch the Rabbit  after all, did he?\"    \"Now you talkin', honey,\" replied the old man, his earnest face  breaking up into little eddies of smiles--\"now you talkin' sho.  'Tain't bin proned inter no Brer B'ar fer ter kotch Brer Rabbit.  Hit sorter like settin' a mule fer ter trap a hummin'-bird.

Brer B'ar drap his axe, he did, en crope up, en retch out wid his  paw, en scoop ole Brer Bull-frog in des dis away.\" Here the old  man used his hand ladle-fashion, by way of illustration. \"He  scoop 'im in, en dar he wuz. W'en Brer B'ar got his clampers on  'im good, he sot down en talk at 'im.    \"'Howdy, Brer Bull-frog, howdy! En how yo fambly? I hope dey er  well, Brer Bull-frog, kaze dis day you got some bizness wid me  w'at'll las' you a mighty long time.'    \"Brer Bull-frog, he dunner w'at ter say.

When he git dar  he lay Brer Bullfrog down on de rock, en Brer Bull-frog make like  he lookin' 'roun' fer his folks. Den Brer B'ar, he draw long  breff en pick up his axe. Den he spit in his han's en draw back  en come down on de rock--pow!\"    \"'Did he kill the Frog, Uncle Remus?\" asked the little boy, as  the old man paused to scoop up a thimbleful of glowing embers in  his pipe.    \"'Deed, en dat he didn't, honey. 'Twix' de time w'en Brer B'ar  raise up wid his axe en w'en he come down wid it, ole Brer  Bull-frog he lipt up en dove down in de mill-pon', kerblink-  kerblunk!

RABBIT LOST HIS FINE BUSHY TAIL    \"ONE time,\" said Uncle Remus, sighing heavily and settling  himself back in his seat with an air of melancholy resignation--  \"one time Brer Rabbit wuz gwine 'long down de road shakin' his  big bushy tail, en feelin' des ez scrumpshus ez a bee-martin wid  a fresh bug.\" Here the old man paused and glanced at the little  boy, but it was evident that the youngster had become so  accustomed to the marvelous developments of"]]]
