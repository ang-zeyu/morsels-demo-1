A certain similarity may be observed  between those belonging to the same natural family, the seeds of all the  cereal grains, for instance, containing in round numbers two per cent of  inorganic matters. Leguminous seeds (peas and beans) contain about three  per cent, while in rape-seed, linseed, and the other oily seeds, it  reaches four per cent. In the stems and straws less uniformity exists,  but with the exception of a few extreme cases, the quantity of ash in  general approaches pretty closely to five per cent. Still more  diversified results are obtained from the entire plants; but this  diversity is probably much more apparent than real, and must be, in part  at least, dependent on the proportion existing between the stem and  leaves, for the leaves are peculiarly rich in ash, and a leafy plant  must necessarily yield a higher total percentage of ash, although, if  stems and leaves were separately examined, they might not show so  conspicuous a difference.    The leaves surpass all other parts of plants, in the proportion of  inorganic constituents they contain, the table showing that in some  instances, as in the maple and Jerusalem artichoke, they exceed  one-fourth of the whole weight of the dry matter. In other leaves, and  more especially in those of the coniferae, the proportion is much  smaller. Taking the average of all the analyses hitherto made, it  appears that leaves contain about thirteen per cent of ash, but the  variations on either side are so large that little value is to be  attached to it except as an indication of the general abundance of  mineral matters.    In roots and tubers the variations are less, and all, except the potato  and the turnip, contain about seven per cent of ash.    The smallest proportion of mineral matter is found in wood. In one case  only does the proportion reach five per cent, while the average scarcely  exceeds one, and in the fir the quantity amounts to no more than one  six-hundredth of the dry matter. In the bark the quantity is much  larger, and may be stated at seven per cent.    The general proportion of ash found in different parts of plants is  given in round numbers in the subjoined table:--    Wood                1  Seeds               3  Stems and straws    5  Roots and tubers    7  Bark                7  Leaves             13    The differences in the quantity of ash contained in different parts of  plants are obviously intended to serve a useful purpose, and it is  interesting to observe that the wood which is destined to remain for a  long period, sometimes for several centuries, a part of the plant,  contains the smallest proportion, and it is not improbable that what it  does contain is really due, not to the actual woody matter itself, but  to the sap which permeates its vessels. By this arrangement but a small  proportion of these important mineral matters, which the soil supplies  in very limited quantity, is locked up within the plant, and those which  are absorbed, after circulating through it, and fulfilling their  allotted functions, are accumulated in the leaves, and annually returned  to the soil.    The different proportions of mineral matters contained in the individual  organs of plants is most strikingly illustrated when parallel  experiments are made on the same species; but the number of instances in  which a sufficiently extensive series of analyses has been made to show  this, is comparatively limited, and is confined to the oat, the  orange-tree, and the horse chesnut--each of which has formed the subject  of a very elaborate investigation. The following table gives the results  obtained on the oat:--    +-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+-------+------+  |             | Hopetoun  | Hopetoun| Potato    | Black | Sandy |      |  |             | Oats,     | Oats,   | Oats,     | Oats, | Oats, | Mean.|  |             | North-    | Fife-   | North-    | Edin- | Fife- |      |  |             | umberland.| shire.  | umberland.| burgh.| shire.|      |  +-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+-------+------+  | Grain       |    2.14   |  1.81   |    2.22   |  2.11 |  1.76 |  2.00|  | Husk        |    6.47   |  6.03   |    6.99   |  8.24 |  6.03 |  6.75|  | Chaff       |   16.53   | 17.23   |   15.59   | 19.19 | 18.97 | 16.06|  | Leaves      |    8.44   |  7.19   |   14.59   | 10.29 | 15.92 | 10.88|  | Upper part  |           |         |           |       |       |      |  |   of straw  |    4.95   |  5.44   |    9.22   |  8.25 | 11.0  |  7.77|  | Middle part |           |         |           |       |       |      |  |   of straw  |    6.11   |  5.23   |    7.41   |  6.53 |  9.01 |  6.66|  | Lower part  |           |         |           |       |       |      |  |   of straw  |    5.33   |  5.18   |    9.76   |  7.11 |  7.30 |  6.93|  +-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+-------+------+    The specimens of oats on which these analyses were made were from  different districts of country, grown on soils of different quality, and  were, further, of different varieties; and yet they show, on the whole,  a remarkable similarity in the proportion of ash in each part, and  indicate that there is a normal quantity belonging to it. Such a series  of analyses also affords the most convincing proof that the inorganic  matters cannot be fortuitous, and merely absorbed from the soil along  with their organic food, as the old chemists supposed, because, in that  case, they ought to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire  plant, and not accumulated in particular proportions in each individual  organ.    Not only does the proportion of ash vary in the different parts of a  plant, but even in the same part it is greatly influenced by its period  of growth. The laws which regulate these variations are very imperfectly  known, but in general it is observed that during the period of active  growth the quantity of ash is largest. Thus, it has been found that in  early spring the wood of the young shoots of the horse-chesnut contains  9.9 per cent of ash. In autumn this has diminished to 3.4, and the last  year's twigs contain only 1.1 per cent, while in the old wood the  quantity does not exceed 0.5. Saussure has also observed that the  quantity of ash diminishes in certain plants when the seed has ripened.  Thus, he found that the percentages of ash, before flowering, and after  seeding, were as follows:--                   Before flowering.  With ripe seed.

But that he contemplated an invasion of  the Transvaal by a handful of policemen is absurd. If he did, why should  he instantly take the strongest steps to render the invasion abortive?  What could he possibly do to make things miscarry which he did not do?  And if he were conscious of being in the power of Mr. Rhodes, how would  he dare to oppose with such vigour that gentleman's pet scheme? The very  facts and the very telegrams upon which critics rely to prove Mr.  Chamberlain's complicity will really, when looked at with unprejudiced  eyes, most clearly show his entire independence. Thus when Rhodes, or  Harris in Rhodes's name, telegraphs, 'Inform Chamberlain that I shall  get through all right if he will support me, but he must not send cable  like he sent to the High Commissioner,' and again, 'Unless you can make  Chamberlain instruct the High Commissioner to proceed at once to  Johannesburg the whole position is lost,' is it not perfectly obvious  that there has been no understanding of any sort, and that the  conspirators are attempting to force the Colonial Secretary's hand?  Again, critics make much of the fact that shortly before the raid Mr.  Chamberlain sold to the Chartered Company the strip of land from which  the raid started, and that he made a hard bargain, exacting as much as  200,000_l._ for it. Surely the perversion of an argument could hardly go  further, for if Mr. Chamberlain were in their confidence and in favour  of their plan it is certain that he would have given them easy and not  difficult terms for the land for which they asked. The supposition that  Mr. Chamberlain was the tool of Rhodes in declaring war, presupposes  that Mr. Chamberlain could impose his will without question upon a  Cabinet which contained Lord Salisbury, Lord Lansdowne, Arthur Balfour,  Hicks-Beach, and the other ministers. Such a supposition is too  monstrous to discuss.    2. _That it is a capitalists' war, engineered by company promoters and  Jews._--After the Jameson Raid a large body of the public held this  view, and it was this which to a great extent tied the hands of the  Government, and stopped them from taking that strong line which might  have prevented the accumulation of those huge armaments which could only  be intended for use against ourselves. It took years to finally  dissipate the idea, but how thoroughly it has been dissipated in the  public mind is best shown by the patient fortitude with which our people  have borne the long and weary struggle in which few families in the land  have not lost either a friend or a relative. The complaisance of the  British public towards capitalists goes no further than giving them  their strict legal rights--and certainly does not extend to pouring out  money and blood like water for their support. Such a supposition is  absurd, nor can any reason be given why a body of high-minded and  honourable British gentlemen like the Cabinet should sacrifice their  country for the sake of a number of cosmopolitan financiers, most of  whom are German Jews. The tax which will eventually be placed upon the  Transvaal mining industry, in order to help to pay for the war, will in  itself prove that the capitalists have no great voice in the councils of  the nation. We know now that the leading capitalists in Johannesburg  were the very men who most strenuously resisted an agitation which might  lead to war. This seems natural enough when one considers how much  capitalists had at stake, and how much to lose by war. The agitation for  the franchise and other rights was a _bona-fide_ liberal agitation,  started by poor men, employes and miners, who intended to live in the  country, not in Park Lane. The capitalists were the very last to be  drawn into it. When I say capitalists I mean the capitalists with  British sympathies, for there is indeed much to be said in favour of the  war being a capitalists' war, in that it was largely caused by the  anti-British attitude and advice of the South African Netherlands  Company, the Dynamite Monopoly, and other leeches which drained the  country. To them a free and honest government meant ruin, and they  strained every nerve, even to paying bogus English agitators, in order  to hinder the cause of reform. Their attitude undoubtedly had something  to do with stiffening the backs of the Boers and so preventing  concessions.    3. _That Britain wanted the gold mines._--No possible accusation is more  popular or more widely believed upon the Continent, and yet none could  be more ridiculous when it is examined. The gold mines are private  companies, with shares held by private shareholders, German and French,  as well as British. Whether the British or the Boer flag flew over the  country would not alienate a single share from any holder, nor would the  wealth of Britain be in any way greater. She will be the poorer by the  vast expense of the war, and it is unlikely that more than one-third of  this expenditure can be covered by taxation of the profits of the gold  mines. Apart from this limited contribution towards the war, how is  Britain the richer because her flag flies over the Rand? The Transvaal  will be a self-governing colony, like all other British colonies, with  its own finance minister, its own budget, its own taxes, even its own  power of imposing duties upon British merchandise. They will pay a  British governor 10,000_l._, and he will be expected to spend 15,000_l._  _We_ know all this because it is part of our British system, but it is  not familiar to those nations who look upon colonies as sources of  direct revenue to the mother country. It is the most general, and at the  same time the most untenable, of all Continental comments upon the war.  The second Transvaal war was the logical sequel of the first, and the  first was fought before gold was discovered in the country.    4. _That it was a monarchy against a republic._--This argument  undoubtedly had weight with those true republics like the United States,  France, and Switzerland, where people who were ignorant of the facts  were led away by mere names. As a matter of fact Great Britain and the  British colonies are among the most democratic communities in the  world. They preserve, partly from sentiment, partly for political  convenience, a hereditary chief, but the will of the people is decisive  upon all questions, and every man by his vote helps to mould the destiny  of the State. There is practically universal suffrage, and the highest  offices of the State are within reach of any citizen who is competent to  attain them. On the other hand, the Transvaal is an oligarchy, not a  democracy, where half the inhabitants claim to be upon an entirely  different footing from the other half. This rule represents the  ascendency of one race over the other, such an ascendency as existed in  Ireland in the eighteenth century. Technically the one country is a  republic and the other a monarchy, but in truth the empire stood for  liberty and the republic for tyranny, race ascendency, corruption,  taxation without representation, and all that is most opposed to the  broader conception of freedom.    5. _That it was a strong nation attacking a weak one._--That appeal to  sentiment and to the sporting instincts of the human race must always be  a powerful one. But in this instance it is entirely misapplied. The  preparation for war, the ultimatum, the invasion, and the first shedding  of blood, all came from the nation which the result has shown to be the  weaker. The reason why this smaller nation attacked so audaciously was  that they knew perfectly well that they were at the time far the  stronger power in South Africa, and all their information led them to  believe that they would continue to be so even when Britain had put  forth all her strength. It certainly seemed that they were justified in  this belief. The chief military critics of the Continent had declared  that 100,000 men was the outside figure which Britain could place in the  field. Against these they knew that without any rising of their kinsmen  in the Cape they could place fifty or sixty thousand men, and their  military history had unfortunately led them to believe that such a force  of Boers, operating under their own conditions with their own horses in  their own country, was far superior to this number of British soldiers.  They knew how excellent was their artillery, and how complete their  preparations. A dozen extracts could be given to show how confident they  were of success, from Blignant's letter with his fears that Chamberlain  would do them out of the war, to Esselen's boast that he would not wash  until he reached the sea. What they did not foresee, and what put out  their plans, was that indignant wave of public opinion throughout the  British Empire which increased threefold--as it would, if necessary,  have increased tenfold--the strength of the army and so enabled it to  beat down the Boer resistance. When war was declared, and for a very  long time afterwards, it was the Boers who were the strong power and the  British who were the weak one, and any sympathy given on the other  understanding was sympathy misapplied. From that time onwards the war  had to take its course, and the British had no choice but to push it to  its end.    6. _That the British refused to arbitrate._--This has been repeated _ad  nauseam_, but the allegation will not bear investigation. There are some  subjects which can be settled by arbitration, and all those Great  Britain freely consented to treat in this fashion, before a tribunal  which should be limited to Great Britain and South Africa. Such a  tribunal would by no means be necessarily drawn from judges who were  committed to one side or the other. There were many men whose moderation  and discretion both sides would admit. Such a man, for example,"]]]
