The controversy has been resumed lately  by Professor Luigi Pigorini in a paper still unpublished which was  read at the sitting of the German Institute, December 17, 1890; and by  Professor Otto Richter in his pamphlet _Die aelteste Wohnstaette des  roemischen Volks_, Berlin, 1891.    In view of the ignorance of ancient writers on this subject, and the  almost absurd definitions they give of the word, we had come to the  conclusion that the altar had been removed or concealed by Augustus,  when he built the Temple of Apollo and the Portico of the Danaids, in  28 B. C. A remarkable inscription discovered September 20, 1890 (to  which I shall refer at length later), by mentioning the Roma Quadrata  as existing A. D. 204, shows that our opinion was wrong, and that the  old altar, the most venerable monument of Roman history, had survived  the vicissitudes of time, and the transformation of the Palatine from  the cradle of the city into the palace of the Caesars.    In December, 1869, when the nuns of the Visitation were laying the  foundations of a new wing of their convent on the area of the Temple  of Apollo,[44] I saw a line of square pilasters at the depth of  forty-one feet below the pavement of the Portico of the Danaids, and  in the centre of the line a heap of stones, either of tufa or  peperino, roughly squared. It is more than probable that, in 1869, I  did not think of the Roma Quadrata, and of its connection with those  remains, so deeply buried in the heart of the hill; but I am sure that  a careful investigation of that sacred spot would lead to very  important results.      THE ARA OF AIUS LOCUTIUS. In 1820, while excavations were proceeding  near the western corner of the Palatine (at the spot marked No. 7, on  the plan, page 106, of \"Ancient Rome\"), an altar was discovered, of  archaic type, inscribed with the following dedication: \"Sacred to a  Divinity, whether male or female. Caius Sextius Calvinus, son of  Caius, praetor, has restored this altar by decree of the Senate.\"  Nibby and Mommsen believe Calvinus to be the magistrate mentioned  twice by Cicero as a candidate against Glaucias in the contest for the  praetorship of 125 B. C. They also identify the altar as (a  restoration of) the one raised behind the Temple of Vesta, in the  \"lower New Street,\" in memory of the mysterious voice announcing the  invasion of the Gauls, in the stillness of the night, and warning the  citizens to strengthen the walls of their city. The voice was  attributed to a local Genius, whom the people named Aius Loquens or  Locutius. As a rule, the priests refrained from mentioning in public  prayers the name and sex of new and slightly known divinities,  especially of local Genii, to which they objected for two reasons:  first, because there was danger of vitiating the ceremony by a false  invocation; secondly, because it was prudent not to reveal the true  name of these tutelary gods to the enemy of the commonwealth, lest in  case of war or siege he could force them to abandon the defence of  that special place, by mysterious and violent rites. The formula _si  deus si dea_, \"whether god or goddess,\" is a consequence of this  superstition; its use is not uncommon on ancient altars; Servius  describes a shield dedicated on the Capitol to the Genius of Rome,  with the inscription: GENIO URBIS ROMAE SIVE MAS SIVE FEMINA, \"to the  tutelary Genius of the city of Rome, whether masculine or feminine.\"  The Palatine altar, of which I give an illustration, cannot fail to  impress the student, on account of its connection with one of the  leading events in history, the capture and burning of Rome by the  Gauls, 390 B. C.    [Illustration: Ara of Aius Locutius on the Palatine.]      THE ARA DITIS ET PROSERPINAE. On the 20th of September, 1890, the  workmen employed in the construction of the main sewer on the left  bank of the Tiber, between the Ponte S. Angelo and the church of S.  Giovanni dei Fiorentini, found a mediaeval wall, built of materials  collected at random from the neighboring ruins. Among them were  fragments of one or more inscriptions which described the celebrations  of the _Ludi Saeculares_ under the Empire. By the end of the day,  seventeen pieces had been recovered, seven of which belonged to the  records of the games celebrated under Augustus, in the year 17 B. C.,  the others to those celebrated under Septimius Severus and Caracalla,  in the year 204 A. D. Later researches led to the discovery of  ninety-six other fragments, making a total of one hundred and  thirteen, of which eight are of the time of Augustus, two of the time  of Domitian, and the rest date from Severus.    [Illustration: Pillar commemorating the _Ludi Saeculares_.]    The fragments of the year 17 B. C., fitted together, make a block  three metres high, containing one hundred and sixty-eight minutely  inscribed lines. This monument, now exhibited in the Baths of  Diocletian, was in the form of a square pillar enclosed by a  projecting frame, with base and capital of the Tuscan order, and it  measured, when entire, four metres in height. I believe that there is  no inscription among the thirty thousand collected in volume vi. of  the \"Corpus\" which makes a more profound impression on the mind, or  appeals more to the imagination than this official report of a state  ceremony which took place over nineteen hundred years ago, and was  attended by the most illustrious men of the age.    The origin of the saecular games seems to be this: In the early days of  Rome the northwest section of the Campus Martius, bordering on the  Tiber, was conspicuous for traces of volcanic activity. There was a  pool here called Tarentum or Terentum, fed by hot sulphur springs, the  efficiency of which is attested by the cure of Volesus, the Sabine,  and his family, described by Valerius Maximus. Heavy vapors hung over  the springs, and tongues of flame were seen issuing from the cracks of  the earth. The locality became known by the name of the fiery field  (_campus ignifer_), and its relationship with the infernal realms was  soon an established fact in folk-lore. An altar to the infernal gods  was erected on the borders of the pool, and games were held  periodically in honor of Dis and Proserpina, the victims being a black  bull and a black cow. Tradition attributed this arrangement of time  and ceremony to Volesus himself, who, grateful for the recovery of his  three children, offered sacrifices to Dis and Proserpina, spread  _lectisternia_, or reclining couches, for the gods, with tables and  viands before them, and celebrated games for three nights, one for  each child which had been restored to health. In the republican epoch  they were called _Ludi Tarentini_, from the name of the pool, and were  celebrated for the purpose of averting from the state the recurrence  of some great calamity by which it had been afflicted. These  calamities being contingencies which no man could foresee, it is  evident that the celebration of the _Ludi Tarentini_ was in no way  connected with definite cycles of time, such as the _saeculum_.    Not long after Augustus had assumed the supreme power, the  _Quindecemviri sacris faciundis_ (a college of priests to whom the  direction of these games had been intrusted from time immemorial)  announced that it was the will of the gods that the _Ludi Saeculares_  should be performed, and misrepresenting and distorting events and  dates, tried to prove that the festival had been held regularly at  intervals of 110 years, which was supposed to be the length of a  _saeculum_. The games of which the Quindecemviri made this assertion  were the Tarentini, instituted for quite a different purpose, but  their suggestion was too pleasing to Augustus and the people to be  despised. Setting aside all disputes about chronology and tradition,  the celebration was appointed for the summer of the year 17 B. C.    [Illustration: Plan and section of the Altar of Dis and Proserpina.]    What was the exact location of the sulphur springs, the Tarentum, and  the altar of the infernal gods? I have reason to regard the discovery  of the Altar of Dis and Proserpina as the most satisfactory I have  made, especially because I made it, if I may so express myself, when  away from Rome on a long leave of absence. It took place in the winter  of 1886-87, during my visit to America. At that time the work of  opening and draining the Corso Vittorio Emanuele had just reached a  place which was considered _terra incognita_ by the topographers, and  indicated by a blank spot in the archaeological maps of the city. I  mean the district between the Vallicella (la Chiesa Nuova, the Palazzo  Cesarini, etc.) and the banks of the Tiber near S. Giovanni dei  Fiorentini. The reports spoke vaguely about the discovery of five or  six parallel walls, built of blocks of peperino, of marble steps in  the centre of this singular monument, of gates with marble posts and  architraves, leading to the spaces between the six parallel walls, and  finally, of a column with foliage carved upon its surface. On my  return to Rome, in the spring of 1887, every trace of the monument had  disappeared under the embankment of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele. I  questioned foremen and workmen, I consulted the notebooks of the  contractors, every day I visited the excavations which were still in  progress, on each side of the Corso, for building the Cavalletti and  Bassi palaces, and lastly, I examined the \"column with foliage carved  upon its surface,\" which in the mean time had been removed to the  courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitol. This marble  fragment, the only one saved from the excavations, gave me the clue to  the mystery. It was not a column, it was a _pulvinus_, or volute, of a  colossal marble altar, worthy of being compared, in size and  perfection of work, with the Altar of Peace discovered under the  Palazzo Fiano,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],[0,"The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#14)"],[1,"  the Rover boys in a crafty, speculative way.    \"He has got it in for us,\" said Tom, but how much Tad Sobber \"had it in\"  for the Rovers was still to be learned.    The boys had not forgotten about the proposed feast, and it was arranged  that it should come off in the dormitory occupied by the Rovers and some  others on the following Tuesday night as soon as all the lights were  out. Word was passed around quietly, and the Rover boys thought that  only their intimate friends knew of what was going on, but they were  mistaken.    By pure accident Nick Pell overheard Larry Colby and Fred Garrison  speaking of the feast. It had been arranged that Larry and Fred should  contribute a big raisin cake and the two boys were wondering how they  could get it from the bake shop in Cedarville and up to the dormitory  without being seen.    \"Never mind, we'll manage it somehow, if we have to use a rope,\" said  Larry.    \"They are going to have a spread,\" said Nick Pell, running up to Tad  Sobber with the story. \"We ought to tell Captain Putnam and spoil things  for them.\"    \"That won't do us any good, Nick,\" answered the bully. \"The captain  thinks too much of the Rovers--he wouldn't punish them much, especially  as this is their last term here. I'll think up something else. I want to  do something to 'em that they will remember as long as they live.\"    \"You seem to be extra bitter against the Rovers since you got back from  Ithaca,\" said Pell, curiously.    \"Am I? Well, I have good cause to be bitter,\" growled Tad Sobber. \"Just  let me put on my thinking cap, and I'll fix 'em, and don't you forget  it!\"    That night the bully asked for permission to go to Cedarville on  important business. He went alone, and once in the town hurried directly  to the museum already mentioned. The proprietor had done little or no  business in the village and was about to move to another place.    When Tad Sobber returned to Putnam Hall he carried under his arm a heavy  pasteboard box which he carried with great care. This box he hid away in  a corner of the barn, among some loose hay.    \"I'm ready to fix the Rovers now,\" he told Nick Pell. \"Keep your mouth  shut but your eyes wide open.\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Just wait and see.\"    At the appointed time the Rovers and their chums assembled in the  dormitory for the feast. A large quantity of good things had been  procured, including chicken sandwiches, cake, oranges and lemonade. Tom  had even had a dealer in Cedarville pack him up several bricks of  ice-cream, and these now rested in some cracked ice in a washbowl.    \"Say, but this is a touch of old times,\" said Sam. \"Do you remember the  first feast we had here, when Mumps got scared to death?\"    \"Indeed I do!\" cried one of the other students. \"Here's to the good old  times!\" and he raised his glass of lemonade to his lips.    In a short while the feast was in full swing. There was a hall monitor  supposed to be on guard, but Tom had bought him off with a slice of  cake, some candy and an orange, and he was keeping himself in a front  hallway, where he could not hear what was going on.    \"If it wasn't for the noise, we might have a song,\" said Sam. \"As it is,  I move Songbird recite 'Mary Had a Little Cow,' or something equally  elevating.\"    \"I can give you an original bit of verse which I have entitled, 'When  the Blossoms Fill the Orchard, Molly Dear,'\" answered the doggerel  maker.    \"Gracious, that sounds like a new nine-cent piece of sheet music,\"  murmured Dick.    \"Can't you whistle it?\" suggested Tom. \"It may sound better.\"    \"Play it out on a fine-tooth comb,\" suggested Larry.    \"Who is ready for ice-cream?\" asked Tom, after a general laugh had  ensued. \"This isn't going to keep hard forever.\"    All were ready, and the bricks were cut, the pieces laid on tiny wooden  plates which had been provided, and passed around. Then came more cake  and fruit.    In the midst of the jollification there came a sudden and unexpected  knock on the door.    \"Who can that be?\" whispered several in alarm.    \"Put out the lights!\" said Tom. \"Those who don't belong here get under  the beds.\" And he began to get the evidences of the feast out of sight,  Dick and Sam assisting him.    With quaking hearts the merry-makers waited for the knock to be  repeated, and waited to hear the sound of Captain Putnam's voice or that  of the first assistant teacher.    \"Bartlett might have warned us,\" whispered Fred. Bartlett was the  monitor who had been bribed.    No other knock came on the door, nor did anybody demand admittance. The  boys waited for several seconds, each holding his breath in anxiety.    \"Who can it be?\" asked Sam of his oldest brother.    \"I suppose I might as well go and see,\" said Dick. \"Maybe some of the  other fellows are up to some tricks.\"    With caution he approached the hall door and opened it. Only a dim light  was burning, and for the instant he could see nothing. Then he caught  sight of a white object on the floor and picked it up. It was a  pasteboard box, tied with a strong string.    \"This must be some kind of a joke,\" he said, and came back into the  dormitory with the box in his hands. \"Light up and let me see what this  is.\"    The lights were lit and several of the boys began to eat the stuff that  had been swept out of sight. They all gazed curiously at the pasteboard  box.    \"Here's a card on the top,\" said Dick, and commenced to read it. The  inscription was as follows:         _To the Rover Boys From Their Friends, Dora, Grace and Nellie._         _Keep it a secret among you and your chums at the feast._    \"How in the world did they know we were going to have a feast?\"  questioned Sam.    \"And how did they manage to smuggle the box into the Hall?\" asked Larry.    \"Open it and see what's inside, Dick,\" came from Tom. \"I'll wager they  have sent us something good.\"    \"Maybe it's a loaf cake,\" said Fred.    \"Oder a pudding,\" broke in Hans. \"I lof chocolate puddings, yah!\"    \"You can't pack a pudding in a box very well,\" commented Songbird.    Holding the box in one hand, Dick undid the string and threw off the  cover.    The next instant he let out a yell of horror and Tom, who was near by,  did likewise and fell over a chair in his fright.    For out of the box glided a real, live snake, fully three feet long, and  with beady and dangerous looking eyes!    [Illustration: FROM OUT OF THE BOX GLIDED A REAL, LIVE SNAKE.]          CHAPTER XVI    THE HUNT FOR A SNAKE      \"It's a snake!\"    \"And it's alive!\"    \"Look out, or he'll bite you!\"    \"There he goes on the floor!\"    These and a number of other cries rang through the dormitory as the  cadets saw the contents of the box. Several tried to back away, and Hans  pitched over Tom and both went in a heap.    \"Ton't you let dot snake bite me!\" roared the German youth.    \"Maybe he's poisonous!\" came from Larry. He had sought safety by leaping  on a bed.    Slowly the snake had lifted itself from the box, to glare at several of  the boys. Then its cold, beady eyes were fixed on Dick and it uttered a  vicious hiss. This was more than the eldest Rover could stand and he let  box and snake drop in a hurry. The snake glided out of sight under a  bed.    \"This is a joke right enough,\" murmured Sam. \"Wonder who played it?\"    \"Do you think the girls would send a snake?\" queried Larry.    \"Of course not,\" answered Tom, who had scrambled up. \"This is the work  of some enemy.\"    \"Look out! The snake is getting busy!\" screamed Sam, and he was right;  the reptile had left the shelter of the bed and was darting across the  room, in the direction of Songbird.    The would-be poet did not stop to argue with his snakeship, but letting  out a wild yell leaped to the top of a small stand which stood in a  corner. The stand was frail and down it went with a crash, the wreckage  catching the snake on the tail. It whipped around and made a lunge at  Songbird's foot, but the youth was too nimble and leaped on the bed.    \"We've got to kill that snake,\" observed Dick, after the reptile had  disappeared for a moment under a washstand. \"If we don't----\"    Crash! It was a plate which Sam shied at the snake, as its head showed  for a moment. Then down went a shower of shoes, brushes, plates, and a  cake of soap. But the snake was not seriously hurt. It hissed viciously  and darted from one side of the dormitory to the other, and made all the  boys climb up on the furniture.    \"This racket will wake up everybody in the school,\" said Dick, and he  was right. The boys had hardly time to get the most of the evidence of  the feast out of the way when they heard a knock on the door.    \"Look out there!\" yelled Tom. \"Don't open that door if you value your  life!\"    \"What's the matter?\" came in George Strong's voice.    \"A snake!\" answered Dick, and then went on in a whisper: \"Quick, boys,  get the rest of the stuff out of the way!\"    His chums understood, and the remains of the feast were swept under bed  covers in a jiffy.    \"Did you say there was a snake in there?\" demanded the teacher.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Sam. \"He's right close to the door now.\" And what he  said was true.    Thinking the youngest Rover might be fooling, the first assistant  teacher opened the door cautiously and peered into the dormitory. Then  he, too, let out a cry of alarm, for the snake darted forward and made  as if to bite him in the foot. Not to be caught he fell back, leaving  the door open about a foot. Through this opening the snake glided and  disappeared in the semi-dark hallway.    By this time Putnam Hall was in an uproar, and boys were pouring into  the hallways demanding to know if there was a fire or a robbery. Soon  Captain Putnam appeared, wrapped in a dressing robe and wearing  slippers.    \"Beware, all of you!\" cried George Strong. \"It's a snake and it is loose  in this hallway somewhere.\"    \"A snake!\" ejaculated the master of Putnam Hall. \"Where did it come  from?\"    \"It"]]]
