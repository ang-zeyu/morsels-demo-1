In his own mind, as he had already  demonstrated to the King, no doubt existed that, if the Greeks attacked  the Bulgars, they had every chance of crushing them and even of taking  their capital.  But there was that General Staff by whose opinions the  King set such store.  They objected Servia's inability to contribute,  as she was bound by her Military Convention to do, 150,000 combatants.  Therefore, in order to meet this objection, he said: \"Don't you think  we might ask the English and the French whether they could not furnish  150,000 combatants of their own?\"    \"Certainly,\" replied the King; \"but they must send Metropolitan  (European) troops, not Colonials.\"    By his own account, M. Venizelos did not take this as meaning that the  King had agreed, if the English and the French supplied these  reinforcements, to depart from neutrality.  He left Tatoi with a clear  perception of the divergence between their respective points of view:  while they both concurred in the need of instant mobilization, one was  for a defensive and the other for an offensive policy; but, as soon  appeared, not without hopes of converting his sovereign by some means  or other.    A busy, ambitious child of fortune never lets the grass grow under his  feet:    \"I returned to the Ministry at 7 p.m.,\" goes on the curious record,  \"and telephoned to the Entente Ministers to come and see me quickly.  When they came, I informed them that a mobilization Order was being  signed at that very moment and would be published that evening; but for  our further course I needed to know if the Powers were disposed to make  good the 150,000 combatants whom Servia was obliged by our Treaty to  contribute for joint action against Bulgaria.  They promised to  telegraph, and immediately dispatched an extra urgent telegram, adding  that they would let me know the answer.  This happened at about 8 p.m.,  and at 8.15 there arrived M. Mercati (the Marshal of the Court) with a  message from the King, asking me not to make this _demarche_ to the  Entente.  I replied that the _demarche_ had already been made.\" [8]    {56}    Forty-eight hours later arrived the Entente Powers' answer, that they  would send to Salonica the 150,000 men asked for.  M. Venizelos, on  communicating this answer to the King, was requested by him to tell the  Entente Ministers that, so long as Bulgaria did not attack Servia, and  consequently the question of Greece going to Servia's assistance did  not arise, no troops should be sent, as their landing on Greek soil  would constitute a violation of Greek neutrality.  M. Venizelos tells  us that he communicated the King's wish to the Entente Ministers, who  telegraphed it to their Governments.    King Constantine, it would seem, was left under the impression that the  affair had ended; and the general belief was that the policy of  neutrality still held good; when suddenly the report came that Allied  troops were on their way to Salonica and that Greece was expected to  assist in their landing.    The news would have astonished the Greeks in any circumstances; but the  circumstances in which it reached them were of a nature to heighten  astonishment into alarm.  Just then (28 September) Sir Edward Grey  stated in the House of Commons, amid loud applause, \"Not only is there  no hostility in this country to Bulgaria, but there is traditionally a  warm feeling of sympathy;\" and he reiterated the Balkan policy of the  Entente--a Balkan {57} agreement on the basis of territorial  concessions.  The inference which the Greeks drew from this coincidence  was that the Entente Powers were sending troops to despoil them on  behalf of the Bulgars--that they intended to bid for Bulgaria's  friendship at the twelfth hour by forcibly seizing the parts of  Macedonia which they had endeavoured in vain to persuade Greece to  yield.[9]    M. Venizelos himself carried the report to the King, inveighing, it is  said, intemperately against the Allies: \"I will protest with the  greatest energy,\" he cried, trembling with anger.  \"I will protest  against this unqualifiable violation of our soil.\"    \"Certainly,\" replied the King, \"you must protest very energetically.\"  [10]    {58}    And M. Venizelos hurried off to his office and drew up the following  telegram, which, now printed for the first time, reveals many things:    \"A grave misunderstanding threatens to develop between Greece and the  Entente Powers on the subject of the despatch of international troops  through Salonica to Servia.  When I suggested the dispatch of 150,000  men destined to complete the Servian contingents in case of a common  struggle against Bulgaria, I did not ask this succour for Greece, but  for Servia in order to remove the objection raised against our  Alliance, said to have become null by Servia's inability to fulfil her  engagement.  By accepting in principle to proceed to such dispatch the  Powers rendered above all a service to Servia and to their own cause in  the East.  Likewise, I had clearly specified that, so long as Greece  was neutral, the landing of international troops at Salonica could not  have our official adhesion.  Our neutrality imposed upon us to protest  for form's sake; after which matters would go on as at Moudros.\" [11]    {59}    \"It remained for us to take all the necessary measures for facilitating  the landing and the direct passage to Servia of the international  troops, combining these operations with the needs of our own  mobilization.  The Minister of Communications was to go at once to  Salonica with a number of engineers to arrange on the spot these  technical matters, very complicated from the paucity of means of  transport in Macedonia.  It was understood that, before any dispatch of  troops to Salonica, we should have twenty-four hours' notice.    \"Things were at this point, when the Military Governor of Salonica--on  Wednesday--received a visit from the French Consul, the Commander of a  French man-of-war, and two French officers from the Dardanelles, who  told him that, in pursuance of a pretended understanding between the  Premier and the French Minister, they were going to start  reconnaissance work for the landing of French troops and the defence of  Salonica against enemy submarines.  Furthermore, on Thursday there  arrived at Salonica General Hamilton with his Staff and notified the  Governor that the Allies were going to occupy part of the town and  port, and put them in a state of defence with a view to a landing of  troops.  General Moschopoulos, very firmly though very politely,  declared to them that, without orders from his Government, it would be  his painful duty to oppose any seizure of national territory.    \"Such a misunderstanding inspires us with the liveliest alarm, for the  contemplated landing has not yet been definitely accepted, and after  being accepted it cannot be carried out, (1) without a preliminary  protest for form's sake, which the British Government has informed us  it does not want;[12] (2) without the absolute maintenance of the  powers of our authorities, who alone would decide the measures for the  use of the port and railways in such a manner as not to compromise the  transport and concentration of our own armies.\"    {60}    \"Moreover, the great emotion caused in the public by the recent speech  of Sir Edward Grey compels the Royal Government to demand from the  Entente Powers certain preliminary assurances.  While people here  expected to see the Powers, after the Bulgarian mobilization, proceed  to decisive acts, and at the very least to a declaration that the  territorial promises made to Bulgaria in August would be cancelled if  within a very short time she did not agree to co-operate with the  Entente, they were stupefied to see that to the most evident proof of  Bulgarian duplicity and disloyalty they replied by redoubling their  solicitude and goodwill.  Sir Edward Grey's speech, followed closely by  the visits made without notice at Salonica by the representatives of  the French and British Staffs, gives birth to the fear that certain  Entente Powers may harbour the design of using the troops which would  be sent to Servia as the fittest instrument for giving practical effect  to the territorial ambitions of the Bulgars in Macedonia.  Well or ill  founded, this fear exercises over people in Greece, and we have reason  to believe in Servia also, a demoralizing effect and threatens to  compromise the success of our mobilization.    \"The Royal Government finds itself confronted with a situation created  much against its will, which imposes upon it the duty, in order to calm  as soon as possible the alarms of the people now in arms, of asking the  Powers to dispel the fears inspired by their attitude towards Bulgaria  by declaring, if possible, that the offers made to her are henceforth  null, and that the eventual dispatch of international troops to Servia  would in no case be turned to the detriment of the territorial  integrity of Greece and Servia.  Only formal assurances in this sense  could justify in the eyes of Greek public opinion the Government which,  while protesting for form's sake, would agree to facilitate the landing  at Salonica and the passage across its territory of international  troops destined for Servia.    \"Please speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the sense of this  telegram.\" [13]    From the tenor of this interesting document we gather that, while fully  aware of the King's attitude, M. Venizelos {61} went on negotiating  with the Allies for immediate action; and that the Allies proceeded to  act before any agreement had been reached.  To judge by its tone, M.  Venizelos seems to have been annoyed at the Allies' haste as at an  unwarrantable attempt to commit him irretrievably without heeding his  conditions or waiting for his definite consent: so grave a breach of  propriety could not but pain him.  But,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#14)"],[1," the same  action, except that she is here sitting. This is the third study I  have seen for this figure--I have one myself, and the third was in the  possession of the late Mr. Blackwood. In the drawing which he made for  this picture, which I have, she is likewise sitting; in the picture,  she is on her legs, but leaning forward. It appears extraordinary that  Rembrandt should have taken so much pains, and have made at last so  very ugly and ill-favoured a figure; but his attention was principally  directed to the colouring and effect, in which it must be acknowledged  he has attained the highest degree of excellence.\" The small picture  in the National Gallery is a study of the same figure. Colour was the  ruling principle with Rembrandt, the Alpha and Omega, in the same way  that Richard Wilson designated the three qualifications for landscape  painting, as contained in one--viz., _breadth_. The tones of colour with  which Rembrandt clothed his subjects are always in the highest degree  appropriate and conducive to the sentiment, whether within the \"solemn  temples,\" or the personification of some great supernatural event. As  most of his historical subjects are from Sacred Writ, he never loses  sight of those qualities which take them out of the page of every-day  occurrences. I shall mention two, though one is sufficient for a  master-key to them all. In the picture of \"The Adoration of the Magi  and Kings,\" in the Queen's Collection, the solemnity is carried to the  utmost extent, like the mysterious leaf of a sybil's book; the only  light shed over the scene seems to descend from the lurid rays of the  star that stood over the place of the nativity, and guided them to the  spot. To acquire the greatest breadth, he has placed the Virgin and  child in the corner of the picture, and low down at the base, with the  same feeling that impelled Shakspere, in his Constance, to utter, \"Here  is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.\" The presentation of incense  and precious perfumes, of diadems and jewels, by crowned heads and  venerable magi, not only removes the attendants to the background, but  even Joseph is represented as wrapt in thought, and viewing from the  shade the solemnity of the scene. The whole colouring of this work is in  accordance with this feeling--subdued, except in the smallest portions  of each hue, and these shine out like sparkling of jewels in a dark  recess.    The other work I would particularize is, \"The Salutation of the Virgin,\"  in the collection of the Marquis of Westminster. This picture, though  of small dimensions, yet exemplifies the peculiarity of Rembrandt's mode  of treatment. Being less decided in the chiaro-scuro and tone of colour  than the Wise Men's Offering, it is more difficult to describe; this  also arises from the exquisite weaving in of the hot and cold colours.  Having had it under my eye for a couple of months, I can easily recall  it on the least effort of the memory; but to bring it before the  spectator who has not seen it, and by no other art than the medium of  words, is as difficult as it would be to bring an harmonious arrangement  of music by a different means--one must be seen and the other heard to  render an explanation evident, which even then can only be understood  by connoisseurs in painting and music. I must therefore avail myself of  technicalities, which may seem out of place, where we are investigating  the general hue of the picture. It is divided into hot and cold colours,  which are brought in contact in the centre--Elizabeth being clothed in  red and yellow, the Virgin in blue, white, and cool grey. The hot colour  is carried across by the red sleeve of Elizabeth, and part of her  yellow shawl, and descends to the petticoat of a Negress who is removing  the grey mantle from the Virgin, and is further extended by a few  warm-coloured stones and touches in the pavement. The cool colour is  carried past the warm tone of Zacharias and the porch above him by means  of a grey green pillar, a peacock, and a few touches of cool colour on a  bush at one corner of the warm side of the picture. The general tone of  the work is of a low, deep hue, so that even the cool tints are not cold  or raw, but a deep-toned brightness pervades the whole. Through the dark  grey sky, that seems to descend to overshadow the group, a gleam of  light darts upon the scene, as a connecting link between heaven and  earth, and giving force and truth to the expression of Elizabeth, when  she pronounces the words, \"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is  the fruit of thy womb.\" The light that shoots through the gloom has  roused a pea-hen and chicks, who shake off their sleep as if it was the  dawn of day.    This is a very imperfect description, but will, nevertheless, serve  to show the fine feeling and deep intent of the genius of Rembrandt.  To extend this investigation further would be perhaps superfluous,  did we not know that, even in our own time, doubts are entertained of  the proper introduction of pictorial arrangements of chiaro-scuro and  colour; but the grand style, like all other modes of portraying a work,  must be made subservient to affecting the feelings of the spectator. I  shall only bring two pictures in contrast to elucidate this principle  still further--\"The Burning of the Books at Ephesus,\" by Sebastian  Bourdon; and \"The Martyrdom of St. Lawrence,\" by Titian. As Bourdon has  been considered the French Raffaelle, it is but fair that he should be  taken as a follower of that school, devoted to composition and correct  drawing, to the absence of all inferior qualities; the consequence is,  he has represented the scene in mid-day, where the flames are red  without extending their influence to surrounding objects; consequently,  they are not luminous, nor conveying the idea of destruction. Titian,  on the contrary, has chosen the darkness of night to represent the  horrors of the martyrdom--the red burning light of the living coal  conveys a tenfold force to the torments of the saint, and the very  reality of the colour gives a corresponding truth to the scene, which  takes it completely out of the regions of apocrypha, and stamps it with  the character of Holy Writ. The descent of the cool light from heaven  upon the scorching body of St. Lawrence is like a rush of water to  counteract his sufferings, and give him a confidence in his future  reward, which the spectator fully enters into. These are the triumphs  that appropriate chiaro-scuro and colour achieve for their introduction  into historical works.    That we may more clearly perceive the rank which Rembrandt holds as a  colourist, I shall endeavour to investigate the peculiar qualities that  characterise the several manners of Titian, Rembrandt, and Reynolds--the  one living before, the other after our artist, and of course confining  the investigation to portraiture alone. I have selected Titian in  preference to Vandyke, not that I consider him, in this branch,  superior; on the contrary, I agree with Sir Joshua, in mentioning  Vandyke as the greatest portrait painter that ever existed, all things  considered--but I wish to confine myself exclusively to colour, and  in this branch it is evident that these three great artists are more  similar in their works than any other painters; but Titian, by the  concurrent testimony of his contemporaries and all succeeding judges  upon the subject, is the highest authority on the great leading  principles of colour. Besides, his works are in many instances uninjured  by the rough usage of uneducated men. With regard to the works of  Rembrandt, which are in comparison as of yesterday, many of them remain  in the same frames and on the same walls on which they were first hung.  The works of Reynolds, though of a more recent date, have suffered more,  not from the ruthless hand of the picture-cleaner, but from his making  use of more perishable materials. Still, from the variety of his  vehicles, changed from an anxiety to get a nearer approach to the look  and appearance of nature, many of his pictures are sufficiently perfect  to build an investigation upon. Previous to the appearance of Giorgione  and Titian, this branch of the art differed but little from the  treatment the several heads received in historical pictures generally;  only with this exception, that when introduced as the component parts  of a work where a story had to be told, they were imbued with action  and expression; but when treated as simple portraiture, the higher  qualities were left out, and a quiet map of the face, to use a familiar  expression, was all that was desired to be transferred to the canvas.  Neither did the head receive that superiority over every other  subordinate part of the work which science and a long line of celebrated  examples seem now so imperatively to demand.    In drawing a comparison between the three great portrait painters, it  is necessary, in the first instance, to refer to the several characters  of their models, or sitters. The nobility of Venice were, at the time  of Titian, men of long descent, dignified, and holding high rank in  a city at that time the emporium of the merchandize of the East, and  distributors of rich manufactures to the whole of civilized Europe;  hence that \"senatorial dignity\" which characterises his works, and  the style and richness of costume so necessary to grandeur, and the  historical air in his portraits. His sitters also possessed countenance  and figure well calculated to engender and support the noblest character  of painting. The sitters of Reynolds, notwithstanding the pomatumed  pyramids of the female hair, or the stiff, formal curls of the male,  which set every attempt to beautify the features at defiance, either  by extension of the forms or harmonizing the several parts of the  countenance, (serious obstacles to pictorial beauty,) were still in  possession of that bland and fascinating look"]]]
