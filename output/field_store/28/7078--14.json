Then she dyed her nails and the  palms of her hands dark-red with another substance named henna.  The  first of these takes about a week to remove, and the last can be got rid  of only by the growth of the nail.  Agnes was not aware of this, else  she might have objected.  They finished up the adornment of the face by  sticking it all over with gold spangles.    \"Now you look lovely,\" said Zooloo--with her eyes--stepping back and  surveying her as a painter might his _chef-d'oeuvre_.    \"Do I?  How nice!\" replied Agnes.    Then the whole party broke into a chorus of laughter, and running to a  wardrobe tumbled out a mass of richly embroidered garments--in silk,  satin, muslin, damask, fine linen, and gold, that would have stocked at  least half a dozen European families with charading material for life.    From this heap were selected and put on a lovely pair of fair linen  drawers, of that baggy kind peculiar to Algerine ladies; also an  exquisite little caftan, or sleeveless jacket, of scarlet cloth, so  covered with gold lace that scarcely any of the scarlet was visible;  likewise a perfect gem of a cap of gold, not bigger than Agnes's own  hand, which Fatma put on in a coquettish style, very much to one side of  the head; saying, (with her eyes), as she did so, and laughing heartily  the while--    \"You're not married yet, of course?\"    To which Agnes replied, also with her eyes, innocently--    \"No, not yet, but I hope to be soon.\"  Whereupon the whole party laughed  immoderately and said, each one with her eyes--    \"There can't be the smallest doubt whatever upon _that_ point!\"    At this point they were interrupted by the entrance of Hanyfa, but that  lady, far from damping their ardour, took particular pleasure in  assisting.  By her advice they cut off a good deal more of the flaxen  hair, and deepened the dye on the eyebrows, nails, and palms.  Gradually, however, Hanyfa drew the negress Zooloo from the scene of  action, and entered into a very earnest conversation in whispers, quite  unheeded by the riotous youngsters.  There seemed to be a pretty good  understanding between these unusually intelligent females, if one might  judge from the nods and winks and knowing smiles which passed between  them; but their confabulation was cut short by the completion of the  toilet.    Many other things of rare value and beauty, which we cannot afford space  to mention, were put upon Agnes, and then she was led by the hand into  the presence of her mamma!    To say that Mrs Langley was dumbfounded is but a feeble way of  expressing the state of her mind.  Although a lady of great moral  courage, and accustomed from infancy to self-control, she felt, on first  beholding her timid little daughter, strongly disposed to seize Fatma by  the hair of the head, and use her as a bludgeon wherewith to fell her  Algerine mother; but, remembering the dignity of her position as, in  some sort, a reflected representative of the British Empire in these  parts, and also recalling to mind the aptitude of Algerine gentlemen to  tie up in sacks and drown obstreperous Algerine ladies, she restrained  herself, bit her lips, and said nothing.    Fortunately at that moment it became necessary to conduct the bride to  her future lord's apartment, which, for the time, was in another part of  the same mansion.    To the cry of \"Lai! lai! lella!\" which was meant to express great joy,  and was always raised at Moorish weddings, the guests conducted poor  Zara to her \"fate.\"    That evening Hanyfa sat at the feet of her lord, Sidi Hamet, and watched  the curls of smoke which, arising from the bowl of his magnificent  hookah, rolled like cannon-wreaths from beneath his frowning and no less  magnificent moustache.    \"Zooloo is a smart girl,\" said Hamet, referring to something that had  just been said.    \"She is,\" assented Hanyfa.    \"You are sure she cannot have misunderstood?\" asked Hamet.    \"Quite sure.  Dressed as a boy, she lay close to their feet at the time  in an angle of the wall near the Djama Djedid, and overheard every word  distinctly.\"    \"Good,\" said the Aga of cavalry, venting a sigh of relief, which  propelled a miniature gunshot half-way across the room; \"that enables me  to decide the course which I shall pursue, and gives us a little  breathing-time before entering on the final act of the play.\"        CHAPTER TEN.    SHOWS WHAT LESSONS WERE TAUGHT IN THE BAGNIO, AND DESCRIBES A BRAVE DASH  FOR FREEDOM.    Bacri, the chief of the Jews, proved as good as his word.    By means of a golden lever he moved some one, who moved some one else,  who moved the Dey to make certain inquiries about the slaves in the  Bagnio, which resulted in his making the discovery that Lucien Rimini  was a first-rate linguist and an excellent scribe.    Immediately he was commanded to fill the office of scrivano to the Dey--  that post being vacant in consequence of the previous secretary having  given his master some offence, for which he had had his head cut off.    But Lucien's elevation did not necessarily improve the condition of his  father and brother.  The Dey cared only for those slaves who made  themselves useful to him; their relations he utterly ignored, unless  they succeeded in gaining his regard.  The Sicilians had too much  common-sense to expect any great immediate advantage from the change,  nevertheless, the slight hope which had been aroused by this event  enabled the two who were left in the Bagnio to endure their lot with  greater fortitude and resignation.  As for Lucien, he resolved to win  the Dey's esteem in order to be able to influence him in favour of his  father and brother.    \"We must learn to submit, my son,\" said Francisco, one evening, while he  and Mariano were finishing the last crumbs of the black bread which  constituted their morning and evening meals.    \"I admit it, father,\" said Mariano, with a long-drawn sigh.  \"Bacri was  right; but it's not easy to bear.  For myself, I think I could stand  their insults and their lash better if they would only spare you, but  when I see the villains strike you as they did to-day--oh, father!\"--  Mariano flushed and clenched his hands--\"it makes me so wild that I feel  as though the blood would burst my veins.  You cannot wonder that I find  it impossible to submit.\"    \"God bless you, boy,\" said Francisco, laying his hand on the youth's  shoulder; \"I understand your feelings--nevertheless it were well that  you learned to restrain them, for rebellion only works evil.  You saw  what was the consequence of your attacking the man who struck me  to-day--you got knocked down and bastinadoed, and I--\"    Francisco paused.    \"Yes, go on, father, I know what you mean.\"    \"Well, I would not hurt your feelings by mentioning it--as you say, you  know what I mean.\"    \"You mean,\" said Mariano, \"that in consequence of my violence they gave  you an additional flogging.  True, father, true; and _that_ is the one  thing that will now enable me to suffer in silence.\"    At this point in the conversation they were interrupted by a deep groan  from a young man in the cell opposite, which was prolonged into an  appalling cry.    Most of the slaves in the foul den had finished their meagre meal and  lain down on the hard floors to seek, in heavy slumber, the repose which  was essential to fit them for the toils of the coming day.    Some of them awoke and raised themselves on their elbows, but sank back  again on seeing that nothing particular had occurred.  A few who had  been rendered callous by their sufferings did not take the trouble to  move, but Francisco and Mariano rose and hastened to the man, supposing  him to have fallen into a fit.  Mariano moved with difficulty owing to  the chains, upwards of sixty pounds weight, which he wore as a  punishment for his recent violence.    \"Go--go back to your rest,\" said the man, who lay with clenched teeth  and hands, as Francisco kneeled beside him, \"there is nothing the matter  with me.\"    \"Nay, friend, you are mistaken,\" said Francisco, taking his hand kindly;  \"your look, and that perspiration on your brow, tell me that something  is the matter with you.  Let me call our jailer, and--\"    \"Call our jailer!\" exclaimed the young man, with a fierce laugh; \"d'you  think that he'd take any notice of a sick slave?  No, when we get sick  we are driven out to work till we get well.  If we don't get well, we  are left to die.\"    \"Surely, surely not!\" said Francisco.    \"Surely not!\" repeated the young man.  \"Look; look there!\"    He pointed as he spoke to the old man who lay on his back at full length  in the recess next to his own.    \"See.  He is a free man now!  I knew he was to be released to-night.  I  have seen many and many a one set free thus since I came here.\"    Francisco was horrified, on going to the place where the old man lay, to  find that he was dead.  He had observed him tottering and looking very  feeble at his work in the stone-quarries that day, but in his own misery  had forgotten him since returning to the Bagnio.    \"Too true!\" he said, returning to the young man; \"his troubles are  indeed ended; but tell me what is it that ails thyself.\"    \"'Tis memory,\" said the young man, raising himself on his elbow, and  gazing sadly into Francisco's face.  \"Your conversation to-night for a  moment aroused memories which I have long sought to stifle.--Lad,\" he  said, laying a hand impressively on Mariano's arm, \"take the advice that  Bacri gave you.  I was once as you are.  I came here--years ago--with a  father like thine; but he was an older and a feebler man.  Like you, I  fought against our fate with the ferocity of a wild beast, and they  tortured me until my life hung by a thread, for I could not endure to  see the old man beaten.  As you said just now, `you cannot wonder that I  found it impossible to submit,' but they taught me to submit.  Oh! they  are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#14)"],[1,"men  with whom I have chummed in years gone by would have said that it was  chance which led me to South America.  I never could agree with them on  this point.  The word `chance' fitly describes the conditions sometimes  existing between man and man, and is used in Scripture in the parable of  the Good Samaritan, but there can be no such thing as chance with the  Almighty.  I must have been led or guided here.    \"At all events, hither I came, and wandered about for some years, with  that aimless indifference to the future which is but too characteristic  of youth--content to eat and sleep and toil, so that I might enjoy life,  and get plenty of excitement!  I went to Peru first, and of course I  joined in the fights that were so frequently stirred up between that  country and its neighbour, Chili.  A very little of that, however,  sufficed.  The brutal ferocity of the soldiery with whom I was mixed up,  and their fearful disregard of age, sex, infirmity, or helpless  childhood during war disgusted me so much that I finally cut the army,  and took to hunting and doing a little trade between the countries lying  on the east and west sides of the Andes.  It was while thus engaged that  I became acquainted with your good father, Senhor Armstrong, who has  more than once helped me over financial difficulties and set me on my  legs.    \"At last came the grand crisis of my life.  One evening when travelling  over the pampas of La Plata, I, with a dozen Gauchos, arrived at a  post-house where we meant to put up for the night.  On coming in sight  of it we saw that something was wrong, for there were a number of  Indians fighting about the door.  On seeing us they made off; but one,  who was in the house struggling with the postmaster, did not observe the  flight of his comrades, or could not get clear of his enemy.  We all  went madly after the savages.  As I was about to pass the door of the  house, I heard a woman shriek.  The Gauchos paid no attention, but  passed on.  I glanced inside, and saw the Indian in the act of cutting a  man's throat, while a girl strove wildly to prevent him.  You may be  sure I was inside in a moment, and I brained the savage with the butt of  a pistol.  But it was too late.  The knife had already done its work,  and the poor man only lived long enough to bless his daughter, who,  covered with her father's blood, sank fainting on the floor.  It was my  first meeting with Mariquita!    \"Around her,\" continued Pedro, in deepening tones, \"lay her mother and  two brothers--all slaughtered.  I will not describe the harrowing scene.  I tried to comfort the poor girl, and we took her on with us to the  next post, where the postmaster's wife attended to her.    \"On seeing her next morning I felt that my life's happiness or sorrow  lay in her hands.  She was innocence, simplicity, beauty, combined.  With artless gratitude she grasped and kissed my hand, regarding me, she  said, as her deliverer, and one who would have saved her father if he  had been in time.    \"Often before had my comrades twitted me with my indifference to the  female sex.  To say truth, I had myself become impressed with the  feeling that I was born to be one of the old bachelors of the world--and  I cannot say that the doom gave me much concern.  But now--well, if you  understand me, senhor, I need not explain, and if you don't understand,  explanation is useless!  Mariquita was left alone in the wide world.  I  would not, for all the gold and silver of Peru, have spoken of love to  her at that time; but I made arrangements with the postmaster and his  wife to take care of the poor girl till I should return.  In time I did  return.  She accepted me.  We were married, and I brought her up here,  for I wanted no society but hers.  I was content to live in absolute  solitude with her.  She was much of the same mind, dear girl, but God  had touched her heart, and in her sweet talk--without intending it, or  dreaming of it--she showed me how selfish I was in thinking only of our  own happiness, and caring nothing for the woes or the joys of our  fellow-men.    \"My conscience reproached me, and I began to think how I could manage to  live a less selfish life, but before I could make up my mind what course  to follow an event occurred which caused delay.  A little girl was sent  to us.  I called her Mariquita, of course, and thought no more of  leaving our happy home in the mountains.  For five years we remained  here, and the little Mariquita grew to be an angel of light and beauty--  like her mother in all respects, except that she was very fair, with  curly golden hair.    \"About that time war broke out--doubly accursed war!  One night a band  of deserters came and attacked my cottage.  It had always been well  prepared for anything of the sort with bolts, and bars and shutters, and  even flanking loop-holes, as well as plenty of fire-arms and ammunition.  But the party was too numerous.  The villains forced the door in spite  of me, and fired a volley before making a rush.  From that moment I  remembered nothing more until I recovered and found my head supported on  the knee of an old man.  I knew him at once to be a poor lonely old  hunter who ranged about in the mountains here, and had paid us  occasional visits.  When he saw I was able to understand him, he told me  that he had come suddenly on the villains and shot two of them, and that  the others, perhaps thinking him the advance-guard of a larger party,  had taken fright and made off.  `But,' he said, in a low, hesitating  tone, `Mariquita is dead!'    \"I sprang up as if I had been shot, but instantly fell again, for my leg  had been broken.  I had seen enough, however.  My beloved one lay dead  on the floor, not far from me, with a bullet through her brain.  And  now,\" added Pedro, pointing in deep despondency to the little mound at  their feet--\"she lies there!\"    \"Not so, my friend,\" said Lawrence, in a low but earnest tone, as he  grasped the man's hand, \"it is only her dust that lies there, and even  _that_ is precious in the sight of her Lord.\"    \"Thank you, senhor, for reminding me,\" returned Pedro; \"but when the  memory of that awful night is strong upon me, my faith almost fails.\"    \"No wonder,\" rejoined Lawrence, \"but what of the child?\"    \"Ah! that is what I asked the old hunter,\" returned Pedro.  \"He started  up, and searched high and low, but could not find her.  Then he went  out, calling her by name loudly, and searched the bushes.  Then he  returned with a wild look and said the robbers must have taken her  away--he would pursue!  I knew it would be useless, for the scoundrels  were mounted and the old hunter was on foot; but I let him go, and was  not surprised when, two hours later, he returned quite exhausted.  `It  is in vain,' he said.  `Yet if I could have come up with them, I would  have died for her.'    \"I was long ill after that.  A good while, they say, I was out of my  mind, but old Ignacio nursed me through.  He also buried Mariquita where  she now lies.\"    The guide paused.    \"And the child?\" asked Lawrence, anxiously.    \"I have sought her far and wide, year after year, over mountain and  plain.  She may be dead--she may be alive--but I have never seen her nor  heard of her from that day to this.\"    \"Your story is a very, very sad one,\" said Lawrence, his face expressing  the genuine sympathy which he felt.  \"May I ask--are your wanderings  mere haphazard?  Have you no idea who they were that stole your little  one, or where they went to?\"    \"None whatever.  The broken leg, you know, prevented my commencing the  search at once, and when I was able to go about I found that all trace  of the band was gone.  No wonder, for the country was at war at the  time, and many marauding parties had traversed the land since then.\"    \"I--I shrink,\" said Lawrence, with some hesitation, \"from even the  appearance of unkindness, but I cannot help expressing the fear that  this vague, undirected wandering will be useless.\"    \"It would be so,\" returned Pedro, \"if God did not direct all human  affairs.  If it be His will, I shall yet find my child on earth.  If  not, I shall find her above--with her mother.  In our intercourse,  senhor, I have observed in you a respect for God's Word.  Is it not  written, `Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him, and He will  bring it to pass?'\"    \"Most true,\" replied Lawrence, feeling the reproof, \"yet God works by  means.  If we do not take the right means, we cannot expect to attain  our end, however much we may trust.\"    \"Right, senhor, and I have taken the _only_ means open to me.  Since I  cannot give direction to my search, I search _everywhere_.  Fortunately  my business permits of this, and also of doing a little service to my  fellow-men as I go on my way.  Periodically I return here to rest,\"--(he  pointed to the little mound,)--\"and when my powers begin to wane, either  through disease or age, it is my purpose, if God permit, to return and  die beside Mariquita's grave.\"        CHAPTER EIGHT.    A NEW ACQUAINTANCE AND A CHANGE OF SCENE.    On their way back to the cottage they heard dogs barking, and a man  talking to them.  Next moment these came in sight.    \"The old hunter!\" exclaimed Pedro, hastening forward with evident  pleasure to meet his friend.    It was equally evident that the old man was as much pleased to meet  Pedro, for they grasped each other's hands with hearty good-will.    \"What news?\" asked the old man, eagerly, as he held up a hand to check  the dogs, which were leaping round him.    Pedro shook his head sadly, and the expression of the old man became  grave.  The question referred to Pedro's search for his lost child.  It  had long been the first inquiry when these two met after a separation.  The old man seemed never to lose hope, but he had become so accustomed  to the reply that his despondency was now of short duration.  He had  known and loved the child in days "]]]
