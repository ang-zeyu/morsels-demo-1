I  was taken prisoner, but escaped.  Again I stumbled upon your trail and  followed it, reaching the summit of this cliff just as the hairy one  was climbing up after you. I was coming to investigate when I heard  your scream--the rest you know.\"    \"But you called Om-at, gund of Kor-ul-JA,\" she insisted. \"Es-sat is  gund.\"    \"Es-sat is dead,\" explained the ape-man. \"Om-at slew him and now Om-at  is gund. Om-at came back seeking you. He found Es-sat in your cave and  killed him.\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl, \"Es-sat came to my cave and I struck him down  with my golden breastplates and escaped.\"    \"And a lion pursued you,\" continued Tarzan, \"and you leaped from the  cliff into Kor-ul-lul, but why you were not killed is beyond me.\"    \"Is there anything beyond you?\" exclaimed Pan-at-lee. \"How could you  know that a lion pursued me and that I leaped from the cliff and not  know that it was the pool of deep water below that saved me?\"    \"I would have known that, too, had not the Kor-ul-lul come then and  prevented me continuing upon your trail. But now I would ask you a  question--by what name do you call the thing with which I just fought?\"    \"It was a Tor-o-don,\" she replied. \"I have seen but one before.  They  are terrible creatures with the cunning of man and the ferocity of a  beast. Great indeed must be the warrior who slays one single-handed.\"  She gazed at him in open admiration.    \"And now,\" said Tarzan, \"you must sleep, for tomorrow we shall return  to Kor-ul-JA and Om-at, and I doubt that you have had much rest these  two nights.\"    Pan-at-lee, lulled by a feeling of security, slept peacefully into the  morning while Tarzan stretched himself upon the hard floor of the  recess just outside her cave.    The sun was high in the heavens when he awoke; for two hours it had  looked down upon another heroic figure miles away--the figure of a  godlike man fighting his way through the hideous morass that lies like  a filthy moat defending Pal-ul-don from the creatures of the outer  world. Now waist deep in the sucking ooze, now menaced by loathsome  reptiles, the man advanced only by virtue of Herculean efforts gaining  laboriously by inches along the devious way that he was forced to  choose in selecting the least precarious footing. Near the center of  the morass was open water--slimy, green-hued water. He reached it at  last after more than two hours of such effort as would have left an  ordinary man spent and dying in the sticky mud, yet he was less than  halfway across the marsh. Greasy with slime and mud was his smooth,  brown hide, and greasy with slime and mud was his beloved Enfield that  had shone so brightly in the first rays of the rising sun.    He paused a moment upon the edge of the open water and then throwing  himself forward struck out to swim across. He swam with long, easy,  powerful strokes calculated less for speed than for endurance, for his  was, primarily, a test of the latter, since beyond the open water was  another two hours or more of gruelling effort between it and solid  ground. He was, perhaps, halfway across and congratulating himself upon  the ease of the achievement of this portion of his task when there  arose from the depths directly in his path a hideous reptile, which,  with wide-distended jaws, bore down upon him, hissing shrilly.    Tarzan arose and stretched, expanded his great chest and drank in deep  draughts of the fresh morning air. His clear eyes scanned the wondrous  beauties of the landscape spread out before them.  Directly below lay  Kor-ul-GRYF, a dense, somber green of gently moving tree tops. To  Tarzan it was neither grim, nor forbidding--it was jungle, beloved  jungle. To his right there spread a panorama of the lower reaches of  the Valley of Jad-ben-Otho, with its winding streams and its blue  lakes.  Gleaming whitely in the sunlight were scattered groups of  dwellings--the feudal strongholds of the lesser chiefs of the Ho-don.  A-lur, the City of Light, he could not see as it was hidden by the  shoulder of the cliff in which the deserted village lay.    For a moment Tarzan gave himself over to that spiritual enjoyment of  beauty that only the man-mind may attain and then Nature asserted  herself and the belly of the beast called aloud that it was hungry.  Again Tarzan looked down at Kor-ul-GRYF. There was the jungle! Grew  there a jungle that would not feed Tarzan? The ape-man smiled and  commenced the descent to the gorge. Was there danger there? Of course.  Who knew it better than Tarzan? In all jungles lies death, for life and  death go hand in hand and where life teems death reaps his fullest  harvest. Never had Tarzan met a creature of the jungle with which he  could not cope--sometimes by virtue of brute strength alone, again by a  combination of brute strength and the cunning of the man-mind; but  Tarzan had never met a GRYF.    He had heard the bellowings in the gorge the night before after he had  lain down to sleep and he had meant to ask Pan-at-lee this morning what  manner of beast so disturbed the slumbers of its betters. He reached  the foot of the cliff and strode into the jungle and here he halted,  his keen eyes and ears watchful and alert, his sensitive nostrils  searching each shifting air current for the scent spoor of game. Again  he advanced deeper into the wood, his light step giving forth no sound,  his bow and arrows in readiness. A light morning breeze was blowing  from up the gorge and in this direction he bent his steps. Many odors  impinged upon his organs of scent. Some of these he classified without  effort, but others were strange--the odors of beasts and of birds, of  trees and shrubs and flowers with which he was unfamiliar. He sensed  faintly the reptilian odor that he had learned to connect with the  strange, nocturnal forms that had loomed dim and bulky on several  occasions since his introduction to Pal-ul-don.    And then, suddenly he caught plainly the strong, sweet odor of Bara,  the deer. Were the belly vocal, Tarzan's would have given a little cry  of joy, for it loved the flesh of Bara. The ape-man moved rapidly, but  cautiously forward. The prey was not far distant and as the hunter  approached it, he took silently to the trees and still in his nostrils  was the faint reptilian odor that spoke of a great creature which he  had never yet seen except as a denser shadow among the dense shadows of  the night; but the odor was of such a faintness as suggests to the  jungle bred the distance of absolute safety.    And now, moving noiselessly, Tarzan came within sight of Bara drinking  at a pool where the stream that waters Kor-ul-GRYF crosses an open  place in the jungle. The deer was too far from the nearest tree to risk  a charge, so the ape-man must depend upon the accuracy and force of his  first arrow, which must drop the deer in its tracks or forfeit both  deer and shaft. Far back came the right hand and the bow, that you or I  might not move, bent easily beneath the muscles of the forest god.  There was a singing twang and Bara, leaping high in air, collapsed upon  the ground, an arrow through his heart. Tarzan dropped to earth and ran  to his kill, lest the animal might even yet rise and escape; but Bara  was safely dead. As Tarzan stooped to lift it to his shoulder there  fell upon his ears a thunderous bellow that seemed almost at his right  elbow, and as his eyes shot in the direction of the sound, there broke  upon his vision such a creature as paleontologists have dreamed as  having possibly existed in the dimmest vistas of Earth's infancy--a  gigantic creature, vibrant with mad rage, that charged, bellowing, upon  him.    When Pan-at-lee awoke she looked out upon the niche in search of  Tarzan. He was not there. She sprang to her feet and rushed out,  looking down into Kor-ul-GRYF guessing that he had gone down in search  of food and there she caught a glimpse of him disappearing into the  forest. For an instant she was panic-stricken. She knew that he was a  stranger in Pal-ul-don and that, so, he might not realize the dangers  that lay in that gorge of terror. Why did she not call to him to  return? You or I might have done so, but no Pal-ul-don, for they know  the ways of the GRYF--they know the weak eyes and the keen ears, and  that at the sound of a human voice they come. To have called to Tarzan,  then, would but have been to invite disaster and so she did not call.  Instead, afraid though she was, she descended into the gorge for the  purpose of overhauling Tarzan and warning him in whispers of his  danger. It was a brave act, since it was performed in the face of  countless ages of inherited fear of the creatures that she might be  called upon to face. Men have been decorated for less.    Pan-at-lee, descended from a long line of hunters, assumed that Tarzan  would move up wind and in this direction she sought his tracks, which  she soon found well marked, since he had made no effort to conceal  them. She moved rapidly until she reached the point at which Tarzan had  taken to the trees. Of course she knew what had happened; since her own  people were semi-arboreal; but she could not track him through the  trees, having no such well-developed sense of scent as he.    She could but hope that he had continued on up wind and in this  direction she moved, her heart pounding in terror against her ribs, her  eyes glancing first in one direction and then another.  She had reached  the edge of a clearing when two things happened--she caught sight of  Tarzan bending over a dead deer and at the same instant a deafening  roar sounded almost beside her.  It terrified her beyond description,  but it brought no paralysis of fear. Instead it galvanized her into  instant action with the result that Pan-at-lee swarmed up the nearest  tree to the very loftiest branch that would sustain her weight. Then  she looked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#14)"],[1," successive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they  deemed it a blessing to have her there. A priest visited her to  confess her every day. \"I have ask'd her,\" says my landlady, \"how she,  as she liv'd, could possibly find so much employment for a confessor?\"  \"Oh,\" said she, \"it is impossible to avoid _vain thoughts_.\" I was  permitted once to visit her. She was cheerful and polite, and  convers'd pleasantly. The room was clean, but had no other furniture  than a matras, a table with a crucifix and book, a stool which she  gave me to sit on, and a picture over the chimney of Saint Veronica  displaying her handkerchief, with the miraculous figure of Christ's  bleeding face on it,[46] which she explained to me with great  seriousness. She look'd pale, but was never sick; and I give it as  another instance on how small an income, life and health may be  supported.    At Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an  ingenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had  been better educated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist,  spoke French, and lov'd reading. I taught him and a friend of his to  swim at twice going into the river, and they soon became good  swimmers. They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who  went to Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's  curiosities.[47] In our return, at the request of the company, whose  curiosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river,  and swam from near Chelsea to Blackfriar's,[48] performing on the way  many feats of activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd and  pleas'd those to whom they were novelties.        [46] The story is that she met Christ on His way to      crucifixion and offered Him her handkerchief to wipe the      blood from His face, after which the handkerchief always      bore the image of Christ's bleeding face.        [47] James Salter, a former servant of Hans Sloane, lived      in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. \"His house, a barber-shop, was      known as 'Don Saltero's Coffee-House.' The curiosities      were in glass cases and constituted an amazing and      motley collection--a petrified crab from China, a      'lignified hog,' Job's tears, Madagascar lances, William      the Conqueror's flaming sword, and Henry the Eighth's      coat of mail.\"--Smyth.        [48] About three miles.    I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studied  and practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added some of my  own, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful. All these  I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much  flatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of  becoming a master, grew more and more attach'd to me on that account,  as well as from the similarity of our studies. He at length proposed  to me traveling all over Europe together, supporting ourselves  everywhere by working at our business. I was once inclined to it; but,  mentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an  hour when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think  only of returning to Pennsylvania, which he was now about to do.    I must record one trait of this good man's character. He had formerly  been in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,  compounded and went to America. There, by a close application to  business as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few  years. Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old  creditors to an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy  composition they had favoured him with, and, when they expected  nothing but the treat, every man at the first remove found under his  plate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid  remainder with interest.    He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should  carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.  He propos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which  he would instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store. He  added, that, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile  business, he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and  bread, etc., to the West Indies, and procure me commissions from  others which would be profitable; and, if I manag'd well, would  establish me handsomely. The thing pleas'd me; for I was grown tired  of London, remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent in  Pennsylvania, and wish'd again to see it; therefore I immediately  agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year,[49] Pennsylvania money;  less, indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affording  a better prospect.        [49] About $167.    I now took leave of printing, as I thought, forever, and was daily  employed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the  tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up,  doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all  was on board, I had a few days' leisure. On one of these days, I was,  to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir  William Wyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or  other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars, and of my teaching  Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons,  about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught  swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them.  They were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could  not undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that,  if I were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get  a good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the  overture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have  returned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more  importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham,  become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.    Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I  work'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in  seeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed  me about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive;  a great sum out of my small earnings! I lov'd him, notwithstanding,  for he had many amiable qualities. I had by no means improv'd my  fortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose  conversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read  considerably.          VII    BEGINNING BUSINESS IN  PHILADELPHIA      We sail'd from Gravesend on the 23rd of July, 1726. For the incidents  of the voyage, I refer you to my Journal, where you will find them all  minutely related. Perhaps the most important part of that journal is  the _plan_[50] to be found in it, which I formed at sea, for  regulating my future conduct in life. It is the more remarkable, as  being formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully  adhered to quite thro' to old age.        [50] \"Not found in the manuscript journal, which was left      among Franklin's papers.\"--Bigelow.    We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry  alterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major  Gordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem'd a  little asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything. I  should have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not her  friends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my  letter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which  was done in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and  soon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name,  it being now said that he had another wife. He was a worthless fellow,  tho' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. He  got into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and  died there. Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with  stationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good,  and seem'd to have a great deal of business.    Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I  attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a  little time, expert at selling. We lodg'd and boarded together; he  counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected  and loved him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in  the beginning of February, 1726/7, when I had just pass'd my  twenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a  pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal,  gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I  found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now,  some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again.  I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at  length carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative  will, as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to  the wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his  executors, and my employment under him ended.    [Illustration: \"Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street\"]    My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my  return to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large  wages by the year, to come and take the management of his  printing-house, that he might better attend his stationer's shop. I  had heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her  friends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. I tri'd  for farther employment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting  with any, I clos'd again with Keimer. I found in his house these  hands: Hugh Meredith,"]]]
