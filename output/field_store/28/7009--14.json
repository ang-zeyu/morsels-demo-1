Among the songs given are several which  betray the transition period of tonality, when chords had come into  legitimate use, but the true feeling for a tonic had not yet been  acquired. The preceding, for instance, proceeds regularly in the key  of G in all respects but the very ending of each strain, which takes  place in the key of C. Or to speak tonically, the melody and  accompaniment after being written nearly all the way in the key of Do,  suddenly diverge to the key of Fa, and there close.

(Edward Jones' \"Relics of the Welsh Bards,\" p. 176)    Another (p. 94) is quite modern in spirit and treatment. It is a  vigorous love song, and there is a boisterous chorus of bards which  comes in with the refrain. A curious feature of this melody is the  full-measure rest, immediately following the strong chorus of the  bards. During the rests we seem to hear the chorus repeated.

Of the Welsh he  says: \"Those who arrive in the morning are entertained until evening  with the conversation of young women, and the music of the harp, for  each house has its young women and harps allotted to this purpose. In  each family the art of playing the harp is held preferable to any  other learning.\"    He adds (chapter XIII, \"Of their Symphonies and Songs\"): \"In their  musical concerts they do not sing in unison, like the inhabitants of  other countries, but in many different parts, so that in a company of  singers, which one very frequently meets with in Wales, you will hear  as many different parts and voices as there are performers, while all  at length unite with organic melody in one consonance, and in the soft  sweetness of B-flat. In the north district of Britain, beyond the  Humber and on the borders of Yorkshire, the inhabitants make use of  the same kind of symphonious harmony, but with less variety, singing  in only two parts, one murmuring in the bass, the other warbling in  the acute or treble. Neither of the two nations has acquired this  peculiarity by art, but by long habit, which has rendered it natural  and familiar; and the practice is now so firmly rooted in them that it  is unusual to hear a single and simple melody well sung, and what is  still more wonderful, the children, even from their infancy, sing in  the same manner. As the English in general do not adopt this mode of  singing, but only those to the north of the countries, I believe it  was from the Danes and Norwegians, by whom these parts of the island  were more frequently invaded, and held longer under their dominion,  that the natives contracted this method of singing.\" In further token  of the universality of music among these people, Gerald mentions the  story of Richard de Clare, who a short time after the death of Richard  I, passed from England into Wales, accompanied by certain other lords  and attendants. At the passage of Coed Grono, at the entrance into the  woods, he dismissed his attendants and pursued his journey undefended,  preceded by a minstrel and a singer, the one accompanying the other on  the fiddle. [\"_Tibicinem praeviens habens et precentorem cantilenae  notulis alternatim in fidiculare respondentem._\"]    Similar devotion to music he found in Ireland. He says: \"The only  thing to which I find this people to apply commendable industry is  playing upon musical instruments, in which they are incomparably more  skillful than any other that I have seen. For their modulation on  these instruments, unlike that of the Britons, to which I am  accustomed, is not slow and harsh, but lively and rapid, while the  harmony is both sweet and gay. It is astonishing that in so complex  and rapid a movement of the fingers the musical proportions can be  preserved, and that throughout the difficult modulations on their  various instruments the harmony is completed with so sweet a velocity,  so unequal an equality, so discordant a concord, as if the chords  sounded together fourths and fifths. They enter into a movement and  conclude it in so delicate a manner, and play the little notes so  sportively under the blunter sounds of the bass strings, enlivening  with wanton levity, or communicating a deeper internal sense of  pleasure, so that the perfection of their art appears in the  concealment of it. From this cause those very strains afford an  unspeakable mental delight to those who have skillfully penetrated  into the mysteries of the art; fatigue rather than gratify the ears of  others, who seeing do not perceive, and hearing do not understand, and  by whom the finest music is esteemed no better than a confused and  disorderly noise, to be heard with unwillingness and disgust. Ireland  only uses and delights in two instruments--the harp and tabor.  Scotland has three--the harp, the tabor and the crowth or crowd.  Wales, the harp, the pipes and the crowd. The Irish also used strings  of brass instead of catgut.\"    The brilliant time of Ireland was the reign of Sir Brian Boirohen, in  the tenth century. After his victory over the Danes, and their  expulsion from the island, he opened schools and colleges for indigent  students, founded libraries, and encouraged learning heartily. He was  one of the best harpers of his kingdom. His harp is preserved in the  library of Trinity College, Dublin, and a well made instrument it is,  albeit now somewhat out of repair. It is about thirty inches high;  the wood is oak and arms of brass. There are twenty-eight strings  fixed in the sounding table by silver buttons in copper-lined holes.  The present appearance of the instrument is this:    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    The Anglo-Saxons also were great amateurs of music. Up to the sixth  century they remained pagan. Gregory the Great sent missionaries to  them, and more than 10,000 were baptized in a single day. The  Venerable Bede represents St. Benoit as establishing the music of the  new church, substituting the plain song of Rome for the Gallic songs  previously used.    While few remains of the literature of the early English have come  down to us, we have enough from the period of the Venerable Bede and  the generation immediately following to give an idea of the vigor and  depth of the national consciousness here brought to expression. From  the seventh to the tenth centuries there was in England a movement  more vigorous, more productive and consequently more modern, than  anything like it in any other part of Europe for three centuries  later. The Saxon poets Caedmon, the Venerable Bede, Alcuin, the friend,  teacher and adviser of that mighty genius Charlemagne, were minds of  the first order.    King Arthur the Great was an enthusiastic and talented minstrel. It is  told of him that in this disguise he made his way successfully into  the Danish camp, and was able to spy out the plans of his invading  enemies. The incident has also a light upon the other side, since it  shows the estimation in which the wandering minstrel was held by the  Danes themselves. King Alfred also established a professorship of  music at Oxford, where, indeed, the university, properly so-called,  did not yet exist, but a school of considerable vigor had been  founded. All the remains of Anglo-Saxon poetry are full of allusions  to the bards, the gleemen and the minstrels; and the poems themselves,  most likely, were the production of poet-musicians classed under these  different names. Many additional reasons might be given for believing  that the art of music was more carefully cultivated in England at this  time than in any other European country. For instance, at Winchester,  in the year 900, a large organ was built in the cathedral--larger than  had ever been built before. It had 400 pipes, whereas most of the  organs previously in use had no more than forty or fifty pipes. There  is reason to believe that among the other musical devices here  practiced that of \"round\" singing was brought to a high degree of  popular skill. Apparently also they had something like what was  afterward called a burden, a refrain which, instead of coming in at  the end of the melody, was sung by a part of the singers continually  with it.    Nor was musical cultivation confined to England. In the eighth and  ninth centuries the Scandinavians had a civilization of considerable  vigor. The minstrels were called Scalds, polishers or smoothers of  language. Fetis well says: \"As eminently poets and singers as they  were barbarians, they put into their songs a strength of ideas, an  energy of sentiment, a richness of imagination with which we are  struck even in translations, admittedly inferior to the originals. Not  less valiant than inspired, their scalds by turns played the harp,  raising their voices in praise of heroes, and precipitated themselves  into the combat with sword and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#14)"],[1,"and provisional. At the meetings of  the British Association during the last few years, the most breezy  discussions in the Anthropological Section have undoubtedly centred  around this subject. There are several works in the field, but the most  comprehensive theory as yet put forward is one that concerns us, as it  has given a new lease of life to the old solar interpretation of the  Deluge story.         (1) See, e.g. Marett, _Anthropology_ (2nd ed., 1914), Chap.       iv, \"Environment,\" pp. 122 ff.; and for earlier tendencies,       particularly in the sphere of mythological exegesis, see S.       Reinach, _Cultes, Mythes et Religions_, t. IV (1912), pp. 1       ff.    In a land such as Egypt, where there is little rain and the sky is  always clear, the sun in its splendour tended from the earliest period  to dominate the national consciousness. As intercourse increased along  the Nile Valley, centres of Sun-worship ceased to be merely local, and  the political rise of a city determined the fortunes of its cult. From  the proto-dynastic period onward, the \"King of the two Lands\" had borne  the title of \"Horus\" as the lineal descendant of the great Sun-god of  Edfu, and the rise of Ra in the Vth Dynasty, through the priesthood of  Heliopolis, was confirmed in the solar theology of the Middle Kingdom.  Thus it was that other deities assumed a solar character as forms of Ra.  Amen, the local god of Thebes, becomes Amen-Ra with the political rise  of his city, and even the old Crocodile-god, Sebek, soars into the sky  as Sebek-Ra. The only other movement in the religion of ancient Egypt,  comparable in importance to this solar development, was the popular cult  of Osiris as God of the Dead, and with it the official religion had to  come to terms. Horus is reborn as the posthumous son of Osiris, and Ra  gladdens his abode during his nightly journey through the Underworld.  The theory with which we are concerned suggests that this dominant trait  in Egyptian religion passed, with other elements of culture, beyond the  bounds of the Nile Valley and influenced the practice and beliefs of  distant races.    This suggestion has been gradually elaborated by its author, Professor  Elliot Smith, who has devoted much attention to the anatomical study of  Egyptian mummification. Beginning with a scrutiny of megalithic building  and sun-worship,(1) he has subsequently deduced, from evidence of common  distribution, the existence of a culture-complex, including in addition  to these two elements the varied practices of tattooing, circumcision,  ear-piercing, that quaint custom known as couvade, head-deformation, and  the prevalence of serpent-cults, myths of petrifaction and the Deluge,  and finally of mummification. The last ingredient was added after an  examination of Papuan mummies had disclosed their apparent resemblance  in points of detail to Egyptian mummies of the XXIst Dynasty. As a  result he assumes the existence of an early cultural movement, for which  the descriptive title \"heliolithic\" has been coined.(2) Starting with  Egypt as its centre, one of the principal lines of its advance is  said to have lain through Syria and Mesopotamia and thence along the  coastlands of Asia to the Far East. The method of distribution and the  suggested part played by the Phoenicians have been already criticized  sufficiently. But in a modified form the theory has found considerable  support, especially among ethnologists interested in Indonesia. I do  not propose to examine in detail the evidence for or against it. It will  suffice to note that the Deluge story and its alleged Egyptian origin in  solar worship form one of the prominent strands in its composition.         (1) Cf. Elliot Smith, _The Ancient Egyptians_, 1911.         (2) See in particular his monograph \"On the significance of       the Geographical Distribution of the Practice of       Mummification\" in the _Memoirs of the Manchester Literary       and Philosophical Society_, 1915.    One weakness of this particular strand is that the Egyptians themselves  possessed no tradition of the Deluge. Indeed the annual inundation  of the Nile is not such as would give rise to a legend of  world-destruction; and in this respect it presents a striking contrast  to the Tigris and Euphrates. The ancient Egyptian's conception of his  own gentle river is reflected in the form he gave the Nile-god, for Hapi  is represented as no fierce warrior or monster. He is given a woman's  breasts as a sign of his fecundity. The nearest Egyptian parallel to  the Deluge story is the \"Legend of the Destruction of Mankind\", which  is engraved on the walls of a chamber in the tomb of Seti I.(1) The late  Sir Gaston Maspero indeed called it \"a dry deluge myth\", but his paradox  was intended to emphasize the difference as much as the parallelism  presented. It is true that in the Egyptian myth the Sun-god causes  mankind to be slain because of their impiety, and he eventually pardons  the survivors. The narrative thus betrays undoubted parallelism to  the Babylonian and Hebrew stories, so far as concerns the attempted  annihilation of mankind by the offended god, but there the resemblance  ends. For water has no part in man's destruction, and the essential  element of a Deluge story is thus absent.(2) Our new Sumerian document,  on the other hand, contains what is by far the earliest example yet  recovered of a genuine Deluge tale; and we may thus use it incidentally  to test this theory of Egyptian influence, and also to ascertain whether  it furnishes any positive evidence on the origin of Deluge stories in  general.         (1) It was first published by Monsieur Naville, _Tranc. Soc.       Bibl. Arch._, IV (1874), pp. 1 ff. The myth may be most       conveniently studied in Dr. Budge's edition in _Egyptian       Literature_, Vol. I, \"Legends of the Gods\" (1912), pp. 14       ff., where the hieroglyphic text and translation are printed       on opposite pages; cf. the summary, op. cit., pp. xxiii ff.,       where the principal literature is also cited. See also his       _Gods of the Egyptians_, Vol. I, chap. xii, pp. 388 ff.         (2) The undoubted points of resemblance, as well as the       equally striking points of divergence, presented by the       Egyptian myth when compared with the Babylonian and Hebrew       stories of a Deluge may be briefly indicated. The impiety of       men in complaining of the age of Ra finds a parallel in the       wickedness of man upon the earth (J) and the corruption of       all flesh (P) of the Hebrew Versions. The summoning by Ra of       the great Heliopolitan cosmic gods in council, including his       personified Eye, the primaeval pair Shu and Tefnut, Keb the       god of the earth and his consort Nut the sky-goddess, and Nu       the primaeval water-god and originally Nut's male       counterpart, is paralleled by the _puhur ilani_, or       \"assembly of the gods\", in the Babylonian Version (see Gilg.       Epic. XI. l. 120 f., and cf. ll. 10 ff.); and they meet in       \"the Great House\", or Sun-temple at Heliopolis, as the       Babylonian gods deliberate in Shuruppak. Egyptian,       Babylonian, and Hebrew narratives all agree in the divine       determination to destroy mankind and in man's ultimate       survival. But the close of the Egyptian story diverges into       another sphere. The slaughter of men by the Eye of Ra in the       form of the goddess Hathor, who during the night wades in       their blood, is suggestive of Africa; and so too is her       drinking of men's blood mixed with the narcotic mandrake and       with seven thousand vessels of beer, with the result that       through drunkenness she ceased from slaughter. The latter       part of the narrative is directly connected with the cult-       ritual and beer-drinking at the Festivals of Hathor and Ra;       but the destruction of men by slaughter in place of drowning       appears to belong to the original myth. Indeed, the only       suggestion of a Deluge story is suggested by the presence of       Nu, the primaeval water-god, at Ra's council, and that is       explicable on other grounds. In any case the points of       resemblance presented by the earlier part of the Egyptian       myth to Semitic Deluge stories are general, not detailed;       and though they may possibly be due to reflection from Asia,       they are not such as to suggest an Egyptian origin for       Deluge myths.    The tablet on which our new version of the Deluge is inscribed was  excavated at Nippur during the third Babylonian expedition sent out by  the University of Pennsylvania; but it was not until the summer of 1912  that its contents were identified, when the several fragments of which  it was composed were assembled and put together. It is a large document,  containing six columns of writing, three on each side; but unfortunately  only the lower half has been recovered, so that considerable gaps occur  in the text.(1) The sharp edges of the broken surface, however, suggest  that it was damaged after removal from the soil, and the possibility  remains that some of the missing fragments may yet be recovered either  at Pennsylvania or in the Museum at Constantinople. As it is not dated,  its age must be determined mainly by the character of its script. A  close examination of the writing suggests that it can hardly have been  inscribed as late as the Kassite Dynasty, since two or three signs  exhibit more archaic forms than occur on any tablets of that period;(2)  and such linguistic corruptions as have been noted in its text may  well be accounted for by the process of decay which must have already  affected the Sumerian language at the time of the later kings of Nisin.  Moreover, the tablet bears a close resemblance to one of the newly  published copies of the Sumerian Dynastic List from Nippur;(3) for both  are of the same shape and composed of the same reddish-brown clay, and"]]]
