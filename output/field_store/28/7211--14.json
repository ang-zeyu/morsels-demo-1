Mastery of the elements comes from perfectly concentrated  Meditation on their five forms: the gross, the elemental, the subtle, the  inherent, the purposive. These five forms are analogous to those  recognized by modern physics: solid, liquid, gaseous, radiant and  ionic. When the piercing vision of the awakened spiritual man is  directed to the forms of matter, from within, as it were, from behind  the scenes, then perfect mastery over the \"beggarly elements\" is  attained. This is, perhaps, equivalent to the injunction: \"Inquire of the  earth, the air, and the water, of the secrets they hold for you. The  development of your inner senses will enable you to do this.\"    45. Thereupon will come the manifestation of the atomic and other  powers, which are the endowment of the body, together with its  unassailable force.    The body in question is, of course, the etheric body of the spiritual  man. He is said to possess eight powers: the atomic, the power of  assimilating himself with the nature of the atom, which will, perhaps,  involve the power to disintegrate material forms; the power of  levitation; the power of limitless extension; the power of boundless  reach, so that, as the commentator says, \"he can touch the moon with  the tip of his finger\"; the power to accomplish his will; the power of  gravitation, the correlative of levitation; the power of command; the  power of creative will. These are the endowments of the spiritual man.  Further, the spiritual body is unassailable. Fire burns it not, water wets  it not, the sword cleaves it not, dry winds parch it not. And, it is said,  the spiritual man can impart something of this quality and temper to  his bodily vesture.    46. Shapeliness, beauty, force, the temper of the diamond: these are  the endowments of that body.    The spiritual man is shapely, beautiful strong, firm as the diamond.  Therefore it is written: \"These things saith the Son of God, who hath  his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass: He  that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I  give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron;  and I will give him the morning star.\"    47. Mastery over the powers of perception and action comes through  perfectly concentrated Meditation on their fivefold forms; namely,  their power to grasp their distinctive nature, the element of  self-consciousness in them, their inherence, and their purposiveness.    Take, for example, sight. This possesses, first, the power to grasp,  apprehend, perceive; second, it has its distinctive form of perception;  that is, visual perception; third, it always carries with its operations  self-consciousness, the thought: \"I perceive\"; fourth sight has the  power of extension through the whole field of vision, even to the  utmost star; fifth, it is used for the purposes of the Seer. So with the  other senses. Perfectly concentrated Meditation on each sense, a  viewing it from behind and within, as is possible for the spiritual man,  brings a mastery of the scope and true character of each sense, and of  the world on which they report collectively.    48. Thence comes the power swift as thought, independent of  instruments, and the mastery over matter.    We are further enumerating the endowments of the spiritual man.  Among these is the power to traverse space with the swiftness of  thought, so that whatever place the spiritual man thinks of, to that he  goes, in that place he already is. Thought has now become his means  of locomotion. He is, therefore, independent of instruments, and can  bring his force to bear directly, wherever he wills.     49. When the spiritual man is perfectly disentangled from the psychic  body, he attains to mastery over all things and to a knowledge of all.    The spiritual man is enmeshed in the web of the emotions; desire, fear,  ambition, passion; and impeded by the mental forms of separateness  and materialism. When these meshes are sundered, these obstacles  completely overcome, then the spiritual man stands forth in his own  wide world, strong, mighty, wise. He uses divine powers, with a  divine scope and energy, working together with divine Companions.  To such a one it is said: \"Thou art now a disciple, able to stand, able  to hear, able to see, able to speak, thou hast conquered desire and  attained to self-knowledge, thou hast seen thy soul in its bloom and  recognized it, and heard the voice of the silence.\"    50. By absence of all self-indulgence at this point, when the seeds of  bondage to sorrow are destroyed, pure spiritual being is attained.    The seeking of indulgence for the personal self, whether through  passion or ambition, sows the seed of future sorrow. For this self  indulgence of the personality is a double sin against the real; a sin  against the cleanness of life, and a sin against the universal being,  which permits no exclusive particular good, since, in the real, all  spiritual possessions are held in common. This twofold sin brings its  reacting punishment, its confining bondage to sorrow. But ceasing  from self-indulgence brings purity, liberation, spiritual life.    51. There should be complete overcoming of allurement or pride in  the invitations of the different realms of life, lest attachment to things  evil arise once more.    The commentator tells us that disciples, seekers for union, are of four  degrees: first, those who are entering the path; second, those who are  in the realm of allurements; third, those who have won the victory  over matter and the senses; fourth, those who stand firm in pure  spiritual life. To the second, especially, the caution in the text is  addressed. More modern teachers would express the same truth by a  warning against the delusions and fascinations of the psychic realm,  which open around the disciple, as he breaks through into the unseen  worlds. These are the dangers of the anteroom. Safety lies in passing  on swiftly into the inner chamber. \"Him that overcometh will I make  a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.\"    52. From perfectly concentrated Meditation on the divisions of time  and their succession comes that wisdom which is born of discernment.    The Upanishads say of the liberated that \"he has passed beyond the  triad of time\"; he no longer sees life as projected into past, present and  future, since these are forms of the mind; but beholds all things spread  out in the quiet light of the Eternal. This would seem to be the same  thought, and to point to that clear-eyed spiritual perception which is  above time; that wisdom born of the unveiling of Time's delusion.  Then shall the disciple live neither in the present nor the future, but in  the Eternal.    53. Hence comes discernment between things which are of like nature,  not distinguished by difference of kind, character or position. Here, as  also in the preceding Sutra, we are close to the doctrine that  distinctions of order, time and space are creations of the mind; the  threefold prism through which the real object appears to us distorted  and refracted. When the prism is withdrawn, the object returns to its  primal unity, no longer distinguishable by the mind, yet clearly  knowable by that high power of spiritual discernment, of illumination,  which is above the mind.    54. The wisdom which is born of discernment is starlike; it discerns  all things, and all conditions of things, it discerns without succession:  simultaneously.    That wisdom, that intuitive, divining power is starlike, says the  commentator, because it shines with its own light, because it rises on  high, and illumines all things. Nought is hid from it, whether things  past, things present, or things to come; for it is beyond the threefold  form of time, so that all things are spread before it together, in the  single light of the divine. This power has been beautifully described by  Columba: \"Some there are, though very few, to whom Divine grace  has granted this: that they can clearly and most distinctly see, at one  and the same moment, as though under one ray of the sun, even the  entire circuit of the whole world with its surroundings of ocean and  sky, the inmost part of their mind being marvellously enlarged.\"    55. When the vesture and the spiritual man are alike pure, then  perfect spiritual life is attained.    The vesture, says the commentator, must first be washed pure of all  stains of passion and darkness, and the seeds of future sorrow must be  burned up utterly. Then, both the vesture and the wearer of the  vesture being alike pure, the spiritual man enters into perfect spiritual  life.        INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV    The third book of the Sutras has fairly completed the history of the  birth and growth of the spiritual man, and the enumeration of his  powers; at least so far as concerns that first epoch in his immortal life,  which immediately succeeds, and supersedes, the life of the natural  man.    In the fourth book, we are to consider what one might call the  mechanism of salvation, the ideally simple working of cosmic law  which brings the spiritual man to birth, growth, and fulness of power,  and prepares him for the splendid, toilsome further stages of his great  journey home.    The Sutras are here brief to obscurity; only a few words, for example,  are given to the great triune mystery and illusion of Time; a phrase or  two indicates the sweep of some universal law. Yet it is hoped that,  by keeping our eyes fixed on the spiritual man, remembering that he  is the hero of the story, and that all that is written concerns him and  his adventures, we may be able to find our way through this thicket of  tangled words, and keep in our hands the clue to the mystery.    The last part of the last book needs little introduction. In a sense, it is  the most important part of the whole treatise, since it unmasks the  nature of the personality, that psychical \"mind,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#14)"],[1," the Rev J.L. Petit._]    The clergy and others wanted something with more resemblance to the  old cathedrals; and first of all the surveyor tried to humour them by  adding another secondary dome to the west. He next set to work making  a great number of sketches, merely, as his grandson says, for  \"Discource sake\"; and one of these was so much approved of that a  model was again made. But the demand for a building with choir, nave,  and aisles complete continued, and required to be satisfied; and at  length one design met with the approval of the king; and on the 14th  of May, 1675, Charles issued his warrant to the commissioners  accordingly, stating that he approved of this particular design  because it was \"very artificial, proper, and useful,\" and could be  built by parts, and that his commissioners were to begin at once with  \"the East-end or Quire.\"    Wren had already become disgusted with the impediments and delays  caused by incompetent judges, and had determined to discontinue making  his drawings and plans public.[64]    We shall never know all that took place during the building so as to  be able to account for the deviations from this design. The king gave  the surveyor permission to make alterations \"rather ornamental than  essential,\" and left the whole to his management, so that the royal  commission was chiefly employed as treasurers. But even this scarcely  explains the great alterations made. The drum and dome of the design,  of comparatively modest dimensions, are crowned with a minaret-like  spire. The west front has but one order of columns, and the towers are  insignificant to a degree. These are amongst the features which were  altered, and they were \"essential\" as distinct from \"ornamental.\" We  know that Wren developed as his experience was enlarged; and we know  also that certain alterations were made contrary to his wish. Beyond  this we are lost in conjecture at the poverty of his design. Perhaps,  despising the taste of the commissioners, he never seriously intended  to adhere to it, anticipating he would be his own master.       [Illustration: THE \"WARRANT\" DESIGN.     _From a drawing in All Souls' College, Oxford. Reproduced from     Blomfield's \"Renaissance Architecture.\"_]    Quickly following on the royal warrant, the first stone was laid June  21, 1675, at the south east corner of the choir.[65] By 1685 the walls  of the choir were finished, with the north and south porticoes, and  the dome piers raised to a like height. When fixing the centre of his  dome, Wren directed a labourer to place a stone as a mark. The man  took a broken fragment of an old gravestone on which was inscribed the  word _Resurgam_; and by many this was naturally taken as a favourable  augury. In 1686 the old west end, hitherto left undisturbed in its  ruins, was cleared away, and two years later the choir was ready for  its roof; but shortly after, a fire at the west of the north choir  aisle, in a room allotted to the organ-builder, caused a slight delay.  Not until 1697 was the choir ready for divine service.    After long years of war, during which the country had suffered from  the heavy burden of taxation, and her commerce had been impaired, the  treaty of Ryswick was at length signed, sealed, and ratified; and  Louis XIV. acknowledged William and Mary as the lawful sovereigns of  these isles. The king returned from the Continent in November, 1697,  and was received with the greatest enthusiasm. Stock almost rose, and  gold almost fell, to par; and every prospect of a returning prosperity  put the public, whatever their politics, in a good humour. A council  at which William presided, resolved that the second day of December  should be kept as a day of Thanksgiving; and the Chapter decided that  the day of Thanksgiving should be the day for the consecration of the  choir. William wished to attend himself; but it was represented that  if he went in procession from Whitehall, the whole population would  turn out, and the parish churches be empty; and he had to rest content  with a service in his palace. At St. Paul's the civic representatives  attended in full state, and Bishop Compton, Dean Sherlock, and the  cathedral staff, occupied the new stalls of Grinling Gibbons. The  temporary organ accompanied the chanting, and a special prayer  incorporated into the Communion office ran: \"We offer our devout  praises and thanksgivings to Thee for this Thy mercy, humbly  beseeching Thee to perfect and establish Thy good work. Thou, O Lord,  dwellest not in houses made with hands; heaven and the heaven of  heavens cannot contain Thee; but though Thy throne is in heaven, earth  is Thy footstool; vouchsafe, therefore, we beseech Thee, Thy gracious  presence in this Thy house to hear our prayers, and accept our  sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving.\" Bishop Compton, who preached,  took for his text, \"I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into  the House of the Lord.\" His sermon has not come down to us, but no  doubt he reminded the clergy and congregation that the day of  Thanksgiving had been selected because it was the dedication of their  metropolitan temple to the public worship of the religion of the  Prince of Peace; that after a lapse of thirty years, and in spite of  the hardship and distress engendered by plague, fire, and war, London  was raising another building on the spot consecrated by centuries of  prayer and praise; and that as the result of the treaty of peace,  their national religion was assured, while the metropolis might  continue to extend her commerce without fear of disaster and  bankruptcy.[66]       [Illustration: A LATER DESIGN.     _From Sir C. Wren's drawings at All Souls' College._     [This is approximately the design finally adopted.]]    Early in 1699, although the nave was not completed, the north-west  chapel was opened for daily morning service, at six in the summer, and  seven in the winter. Queen Anne attended in state for the victories of  Marlborough on land, and of Ormond and Rook at sea (Nov. 12, 1702).  Two years later came Blenheim; and she went again in her state coach  drawn by eight bays. From the west door to the choir, under the  unfinished vaulting and dome, the way was lined by a detachment of  Foot Guards; and as the long procession advanced, the hautboys played  and the drums beat until the Queen and her husband had reached their  throne in the centre of the choir towards the west, when, after a  pause, service began. Dean Sherlock preached from the text, \"Doubtless  there is a God that judgeth the earth\"; and the service, which began  at one, lasted some three hours. On four other occasions Anne repeated  these visits--thrice for victories, and once for the union of England  and Scotland.[67]    Although the commissioners decided that the dome was to be covered  with copper, lead was used instead, and the work steadily progressed  until two years after the last royal visit, when the fabric was  completed. Wren was now seventy-eight years of age, and his son  Christopher represented him when, in company with the master-mason,  Edward Strong, and other free and accepted masons, the last stone was  laid on the summit of the lantern, a great crowd looking on from  below. Stephen was able to reflect with satisfaction that the  cathedral had been begun and finished by his grandfather, and  practically during the time of one bishop, for Henchman had died a few  months after the laying of the first stone; and he contrasted this  with St. Peter's at Rome, where, with an unlimited supply of marble  and other costly building materials ready at hand, one hundred and  fifty-three years had been required under nineteen popes from Julius  II. to Innocent X., and under twelve architects from Bramante to  Berninus. Stephen forgot, however, that St. Peter's is more than twice  the size of St. Paul's, and that only the bare fabric of the latter  was ready, and that it still wanted its mosaics and other adornments.    Under Wren as Surveyor-General we have already mentioned the  master-mason Edward Strong and his son Edward. John Oliver was  Assistant-Surveyor and Purveyor, with a salary of L100; Lawrence  Spencer was Clerk of the Works and Pay-master at a like salary; Thomas  Russell was Clerk of the Cheque at a salary of L50, and called over  the roll of workmen at six in the morning, one in the afternoon, and  six in the evening.[68] It has to be added that Wren and the royal  commissioners did not agree; and that about the time of the  consecration of the choir, an Act was passed with a clause suspending  \"_a moiety of the Surveyor's Salary until the said Church should be  finished, thereby the better to encourage him to finish the same with  the utmost Diligence and Expedition_.\" His salary of L200 was thus  reduced temporarily to L100, and the arrears, in accordance with the  terms of this Act, were not made good until the completion. And worse  than this was the charge brought against him that he deliberately  delayed the building so that his pittance of two hundred a year might  be continued. The commissioners knew nothing of building, and, like  many people of to-day, may have thought that the old cathedrals were  finished in a few years. Fortunately, Wren was an enthusiast in his  great work, and the happy possessor of an equable temperament that  nothing could seriously disturb. Otherwise this disgraceful treatment  of so old a man might well have been fatal.    It is better to turn away from this as quickly as may be, and  contemplate with a laudable pride the great achievement of our  ancestors. The Plague, and still more the Fire, must have seriously  impoverished the City; and in 1703 the great storm did immense damage.  Of the five-and-thirty years the cathedral was in building, one half  were years of war; and the public confidence and security were further  disturbed by a revolution, by civil war in Ireland, and by plots and  intrigues without"]]]
