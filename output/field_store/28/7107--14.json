Spain could not send a large enough army to the  island to conquer the people while they were at liberty to roam through  the jungles and mountains, and so began to drive men, women, and  children into various cities or camps, where they were kept, under  penalty of death if they tried to escape. Thus large numbers were torn  from their homes, and sent miles and miles away, with no money, and  nothing with which to support themselves. Food became scarce and high in  price, and many grown folks and children were literally starved to  death.    To help these starving people the Congress of our country voted to  expend fifty thousand dollars from the national treasury. This excited  Spain more than ever, and we were accused of trying to prolong the  rebellion. But the deed was done, and many would have had us go farther,  and recognize Cuba as a free and independent nation. This desire was  overruled on the ground that our government could not with propriety  endanger the peace of the world by taking so serious a step at that  time. But the strength of popular sympathy with an oppressed people was  shown by the fact that many Americans at grave personal risk went to  Cuba, and joined the army in one capacity or another, fighting as  bravely as if for their own individual rights.          CHAPTER XII    DESTRUCTION OF THE _MAINE_--DEWEY'S VICTORY--THEODORE ROOSEVELT BECOMES  A SOLDIER--ORGANIZING THE ROUGH RIDERS--VARIOUS MEN IN THE COMMAND      \"The _Maine_ has been blown up!\"    Such was the awful news which startled this whole nation in the middle  of February, 1898, and which caused the question of war with Spain to  crystallize without further deliberation.    The _Maine_ was a battleship of large size, that had been sent down to  the harbor of Havana, Cuba, on nothing more than a friendly visit. The  explosion that destroyed this noble vessel occurred about ten o'clock at  night, and was heard for miles around. Soon after the explosion, the  war-ship began to sink, and over two hundred and fifty sailors and  officers lost their lives.    The entire nation was now aroused, and many wanted to go to war with  Spain immediately. But the Spaniards professed to be ignorant of the  cause of the explosion, and said it must have come from the _inside_ of  the ship and not the _outside_. Without delay a Board of Inquiry was  established, and it was settled that the explosion had come from the  outside, probably from a mine set by the Spaniards in Havana Harbor.    \"This means war, and nothing but war,\" said even the wisest of our  statesmen. And so it proved. Without hesitation the whole nation sprang  forward to uphold the administration, and in a few days Congress passed  an appropriation of fifty millions of dollars \"for national defence.\" It  may be added that this appropriation was passed unanimously, regardless  of party politics and regardless of the differences which, in the past,  had existed between the North and the South.    We have already learned what had been done to prepare the navy for the  conflicts to follow. Now there was even more work on hand, to get the  army into shape for service in Cuba and on other foreign soil.    The regular army at that time consisted of about twenty-five thousand  men, scattered all over the United States,--on the frontier, at the  Indian reservations, and along the sea-coasts. Many of these troops were  hurried to camps in the southeast portion of our country, leaving but  small garrisons in the far West.    It was realized by President McKinley that our regular army could not  cope with the troubles at hand, and soon came a call for one hundred and  twenty-five thousand volunteers. These volunteers were to come from the  various States and Territories, each furnishing its proportion of  soldiers according to its population. These soldiers were quickly  collected and marched to the various state camps, there to be sworn into  the service of the United States.    The \"war fever\" was everywhere, and many private parties began to raise  companies, while all sorts of independent commands, Grand Army,  Confederate Veterans, Italian-American Guards, German Singing Societies,  Colored Guards, and the like, offered their assistance. Even the  colleges caught the fever, and men went forth from Yale, Harvard,  Princeton, and other institutions of learning to battle for Uncle Sam.    The first blow struck at Spain was a most effective one. Commodore,  afterwards Admiral, Dewey was at Hong Kong when the trouble began, and  he was directed by the War Department to hunt for a Spanish fleet  somewhere among the Philippine Islands and engage it. On Sunday, May 1,  came the news that the gallant commodore had reached Manila Bay, fought  the Spanish fleet and sunk every hostile ship, and come out of the  battle with all of his own ships safe and not a single man killed!    \"Hurrah! that shows what our navy can do!\" cried many citizens. And they  were justly proud. In the past, foreign nations had looked with  something akin to scorn on our vessels and the way they were manned. Now  such criticism was silenced; and this result was, in a certain measure,  due to the work of Theodore Roosevelt, while First Assistant Secretary  to Secretary Long.    But Theodore Roosevelt was no longer in the department. He resigned and  closed his desk, saying, \"My duty here is done; my place is in the  field.\" With such an active nature, it was impossible for him to remain  a private citizen while stern war was a reality.    In his own excellent work, \"The Rough Riders,\" and in his sworn  testimony before the Commission of Investigation of the Spanish War, Mr.  Roosevelt has given us graphic pictures of how the First United States  Volunteer Cavalry, commonly called the Rough Riders, happened to be  organized, and what it tried to do and did, and this testimony is  supplemented by many who know the facts, and who took part in the  battles which made the organization famous throughout the length and  breadth of our land.    At first Theodore Roosevelt thought to attach himself to the militia of  New York, but found every place taken.    \"Let us try one of my Massachusetts regiments,\" said Dr. Wood. And this  was also done, with a like result.    \"We could fill every place, did we want five times as many men,\" said  one colonel. \"Everybody seems crazy to go.\" This shows how truly  patriotic our nation can become when the occasion arises for going to  the front.    While Theodore Roosevelt and his intimate friend were wondering what to  do next, Congress authorized the raising of three cavalry regiments, to  be composed of the daring riflemen and riders of New Mexico, Oklahoma,  Arizona, and Indian Territory.    \"There, that will just suit me,\" said Theodore Roosevelt. \"I know many  of those men, and I know we can raise a regiment in no time.\"    And without delay he sought out Secretary of War Alger and told him of  his hopes.    \"I am perfectly willing to give you command of one of those regiments,\"  said the war secretary. \"I know you are something of a rough rider  yourself, and a good marksman to boot.\"    This was certainly flattering, but Theodore Roosevelt's head was not  turned by the offer.    \"I don't think I am quite ready to take command,\" said he. \"I know that  I can learn, and that quickly, but it will be precious time wasted.\"    \"Well, what do you wish, Mr. Roosevelt?\" asked the Secretary of War,  curiously.    \"What I should like best of all is for Dr. Wood to become colonel of the  regiment, and for myself to become lieutenant-colonel.\"    \"Very well; I will consult President McKinley on the subject,\" said the  secretary. The request was granted, and in a few days more Colonel Wood  and Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt sallied forth to organize the Rough  Riders, and fit them for service in Cuba.    Leaving his family, which now consisted of his wife and six children,  the lieutenant-colonel made his way to San Antonio, Texas, where the  regiment was to gather. Previous to going he spent a full week in  Washington, seeing to it that arrangements were completed for supplying  the command with uniforms, carbines, saddles, and other articles which  were needed. This was in itself quite a task, for all of the departments  at the Capitol were more than busy, and it took a great amount of  \"hustling\" to get what one wanted.    As soon as it was known that Theodore Roosevelt was going to help  organize the Rough Riders, offers from everywhere began to pour in upon  him. Not alone did the men of the plains and ranch who knew him want  to go, but likewise his old college chums at Harvard. These men, of  wealth and good families, were willing to serve in any capacity, if only  they could be mustered in. There were crack base-ball and foot-ball  players, yachtsmen, all-round athletes and men of fortune, all mixed in  with hunters, cowboys, men who had served as sheriffs in the far West,  where fighting was an everyday occurrence, some policemen who had served  under Roosevelt when he was a Police Commissioner in New York, and even  some Indians. Nearly every nationality was represented when it came to  blood, and the men ran from the best educated to the most ignorant.    [Illustration: Theodore Roosevelt as a Rough Rider (_Photograph by Pach  Bros., N.Y._)]    But there were three tests which every man, private or officer, had to  pass. He had to be in perfect health, he had to know how to ride, and he  had to know how to shoot. To these conditions were afterward added two  more: each man had to learn his duty as quickly as he could and had to  learn to obey his superiors.    In such a collection of soldiers it was but natural that the real  leaders soon asserted themselves. Several of the captains had served in  the United States army before; two were former famous western sheriffs;  and all were full of that pluck and energy which is bound to command  success.

[71] The _chort_ of this legend is evidently akin to the devil  himself, whom traditions frequently connect with blacksmiths; but his  prototype, in the original form of this story, was doubtless a demigod  or demon. His part is played by St. Nicholas in the legend of \"The  Priest with the Greedy Eyes,\" for which, and for further comment on  the story, see Chap. VI.          CHAPTER II.    MYTHOLOGICAL.    _Principal Incarnations of Evil._      The present chapter is devoted to specimens of those skazkas which  most Russian critics assert to be distinctly mythical. The stories of  this class are so numerous, that the task of selection has been by no  means easy. But I have done my best to choose such examples as are  most characteristic of that species of the \"mythical\" folk-tale which  prevails in Russia, and to avoid, as far as possible, the repetition  of narratives which have already been made familiar to the English  reader by translations of German and Scandinavian stories.    There is a more marked individuality in the Russian tales of this  kind, as compared with those of Western Europe, than is to be traced  in the stories (especially those of a humorous cast) which relate to  the events that chequer an ordinary existence. The actors in the  _comediettas_ of European peasant-life vary but little, either in  title or in character, wherever the scene may be laid; just as in the  European beast-epos the Fox, the Wolf, and the Bear play parts which  change but slightly with the regions they inhabit. But the  supernatural beings which people the fairy-land peculiar to each race,  though closely resembling each other in many respects, differ  conspicuously in others. They may, it is true, be nothing more than  various developments of the same original type; they may be traceable  to germs common to the prehistoric ancestors of the now widely  separated Aryan peoples; their peculiarities may simply be due to the  accidents to which travellers from distant lands are liable. But at  all events each family now has features of its own, typical  characteristics by which it may be readily distinguished from its  neighbors. My chief aim at present is to give an idea of those  characteristics which lend individuality to the \"mythical beings\" in  the Skazkas; in order to effect this, I shall attempt a delineation of  those supernatural figures, to some extent peculiar to Slavonic  fairy-land, which make their appearance in the Russian folk-tales. I  have given a brief sketch of them elsewhere.[72] I now propose to deal  with them more fully, quoting at length, instead of merely mentioning,  some of the evidence on which the proof of their existence depends.    For the sake of convenience, we may select from the great mass of the  mythical skazkas those which are supposed most manifestly to typify  the conflict of opposing elements--whether of Good and Evil, or of  Light and Darkness, or of Heat and Cold, or of any other pair of  antagonistic forces or phenomena. The typical hero of this class of  stories, who represents the cause of right, and who is resolved by  mythologists into so many different essences, presents almost  identically the same appearance in most of the countries wherein he  has become naturalized. He is endowed with supernatural powers, but he  remains a man, for all that. Whether as prince or peasant, he alters  but very little in his wanderings among the Aryan races of Europe.    And a somewhat similar statement may be made about his feminine  counterpart--for all the types of Fairy-land life are of an  epicene nature, admitting of a feminine as well as a masculine  development--the heroine who in the Skazkas, as well as in other  folk-tales, braves the wrath of female demons in quest of means  whereby to lighten the darkness of her home, or rescues her bewitched  brothers from the thraldom of an enchantress, or liberates her captive  husband from a dungeon's gloom.    But their antagonists--the dark or evil beings whom the hero attacks  and eventually destroys, or whom the heroine overcomes by her virtues,  her subtlety, or her skill--vary to a considerable extent with the  region they occupy, or rather with the people in whose memories they  dwell. The Giants by killing whom our own Jack gained his renown, the  Norse Trolls, the Ogres of southern romance, the Drakos and Lamia of  modern Greece, the Lithuanian Laume--these and all the other groups of  monstrous forms under which the imagination of each race has embodied  its ideas about (according to one hypothesis) the Powers of Darkness  it feared, or (according to another) the Aborigines it detested,  differ from each other to a considerable and easily recognizable  extent. An excellent illustration of this statement is offered by the  contrast between the Slavonic group of supernatural beings of this  class and their equivalents in lands tenanted by non-Slavonic members  of the Indo-European family. A family likeness will, of course, be  traced between all these conceptions of popular fancy, but the gloomy  figures with which the folk-tales of the Slavonians render us familiar  may be distinguished at a glance among their kindred monsters of  Latin, Hellenic, Teutonic, or Celtic extraction. Of those among the  number to which the Russian skazkas relate I will now proceed to give  a sketch, allowing the stories, so far as is possible, to speak for  themselves.    If the powers of darkness in the \"mythical\" skazkas are divided into  two groups--the one male, the other female--there stand out as the  most prominent figures in the former set, the Snake (or some other  illustration of \"Zoological Mythology\"), Koshchei the Deathless, and  the Morskoi Tsar or King of the Waters. In the latter group the  principal characters are the Baba Yaga, or Hag, her close connection  the Witch, and the Female Snake. On the forms and natures of the less  conspicuous characters to be found in either class we will not at  present dwell. An opportunity for commenting on some of them will be  afforded in another chapter.    To begin with the Snake. His outline, like that of the cloud with  which he is so frequently associated, and which he is often supposed  to typify, is seldom well-defined. Now in one form and now in another,  he glides a shifting shape, of which it is difficult to obtain a  satisfactory view. Sometimes he retains throughout the story an  exclusively reptilian character; sometimes he is of a mixed nature,  partly serpent and partly man. In one story we see him riding on  horseback, with hawk on wrist (or raven on shoulder) and hound at  heel; in another he figures as a composite being with a human body and  a serpent's head; in a third he flies as a fiery snake into his  mistress's bower, stamps with his foot on the ground, and becomes a  youthful gallant. But in most cases he is a serpent which in outward  appearance seems to differ from other ophidians only in being winged  and polycephalous--the number of his heads generally varying from  three to twelve.[73]    He is often known by the name of Zmei [snake] Goruinuich [son of the  _gora_ or mountain], and sometimes he is supposed to dwell in the  mountain caverns. To his abode, whether in the bowels of the earth, or  in the open light of day--whether it be a sumptuous palace or \"an  _izba_ on fowl's legs,\" a hut upheld by slender supports on which it  turns as on a pivot--he carries off his prey. In one story he appears  to have stolen, or in some way concealed, the day-light; in another  the bright moon and the many stars come forth from within him after  his death. But as a general rule it is some queen or princess whom he  tears away from her home, as Pluto carried off Proserpina, and who  remains with him reluctantly, and hails as her rescuer the hero who  comes to give him battle. Sometimes, however, the snake is represented  as having a wife of his own species, and daughters who share their  parent's tastes and powers. Such is the case in the (South-Russian)  story of        IVAN POPYALOF.[74]      Once upon a time there was an old couple, and they had three    sons. Two of these had their wits about them, but the third    was a simpleton, Ivan by name, surnamed Popyalof.      For twelve whole years Ivan lay among the ashes from the    stove; but then he arose, and shook himself, so that six poods    of ashes[75] fell off from him.      Now in the land in which Ivan lived there was never any    day, but"]]]
