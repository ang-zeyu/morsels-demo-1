It was a night wherein a hundred searchlights and a million star-flares  would not have made more impression on the density of the fog than  would the striking of a safety match. Yet the twelve reconnoiterers  were instructed to proceed in the cautious manner customary to such  nocturnal expeditions into No Man's Land. They moved forward at the  lieutenant's order, tiptoeing abreast, some twenty feet apart from one  another, and advancing in three-foot strides. At every thirty steps the  entire line was required to halt and to reestablish contact--in other  words, to \"dress\" on the lieutenant, who was at the extreme right.    This maneuver was more time-wasting and less simple than its recital  would imply. For in the dark, unaccustomed legs are liable to  miscalculation in the matter of length of stride, even when shell-holes  and other inequalities of ground do not complicate the calculations  still further. And it is hard to maintain a perfectly straight line  when moving forward through choking fog and over scores of obstacles.    The halts for realignment consumed much time and caused no little  confusion. Nervousness began to encompass the Missouri recruit. He was  as brave as the next man. But there is something creepy about walking  with measured tread through an invisible space, with no sound but the  stealthy pad-pad-pad of equally hesitant footsteps twenty feet away on  either side. The Missourian was grateful for the intervals that brought  the men into mutual contact, as the eerie march continued.    The first line of barbed wire was cut and passed. Then followed an  endless groping progress across No Man's Land, and several delays, as  one man or another had trouble in finding contact with his neighbor.    At last the party came to the German wires. The lieutenant had drawn on  a rubber glove. In his gloved hand he grasped a strip of steel which he  held in front of him, like a wand, fanning the air with it.    As he came to the entanglement, he probed the barbed wire carefully  with his wand, watching for an ensuing spark. For the Germans more than  once had been known to electrify their wires, with fatal results to  luckless prowlers.    These wires, to-night, were not charged. And, with pliers, the  lieutenant and Mahan started to cut a passageway through them.    As the very first strand parted under his pressure, Mahan laid one hand  warningly on the lieutenant's sleeve, and then passed the same  prearranged warning down the line to the left.    Silence--moveless, tense, sharply listening silence--followed his  motion. Then the rest of the party heard the sound which Mahan's keener  ears had caught a moment earlier--the thud of many marching feet. Here  was no furtive creeping, as when the twelve Yankees had moved along.  Rather was it the rhythmic beat of at least a hundred pairs of  shapeless army boots--perhaps of more. The unseen marchers were moving  wordlessly, but with no effort at muffling the even tread of their  multiple feet.    \"They're coming this way!\" breathed Sergeant Mahan almost without  sound, his lips close to the excited young lieutenant's ear. \"And  they're not fifty paces off. That means they're boches. So near the  German wire, our men would either be crawling or else charging, not  marching! It's a company--maybe a battalion--coming back from a  reconnaissance, and making for a gap in their own wire some where near  here. If we lay low there's an off chance they may pass us by.\"    Without awaiting the lieutenant's order, Mahan passed along the signal  for every man to drop to earth and lie there. He all but forced the  eagerly gesticulating lieutenant to the ground.    On came the swinging tread of the Germans. Mahan, listening  breathlessly, tried to gauge the distance and the direction. He  figured, presently, that the break the Germans had made in their wire  could be only a few yards below the spot where he and the lieutenant  had been at work with the pliers. Thus the intruders, from their  present course, must inevitably pass very close to the prostrate  Americans--so close, perhaps, as to brush against the nearest of them,  or even to step on one or more of the crouching figures.    Mahan whispered to the man on his immediate left, the rookie from  Missouri:    \"Edge closer to the wire--close as you can wiggle, and lie flat. Pass  on the word.\"    The Missourian obeyed. Before writhing his long body forward against  the bristly mass of wire he passed the instructions on to the man at  his own left.    But his nerves were at breaking-point.    It had been bad enough to crawl through the blind fog, with the ghostly  steps of his comrades pattering softly at either side of him. But it  was a thousand times harder to lie helpless here, in the choking fog  and on the soaked ground, while countless enemies were bearing down,  unseen, upon him, on one side, and an impenetrable wire cut off his  retreat on the other.    The Missourian had let his imagination begin to work; always a mistake  in a private soldier. He was visualizing the moment when this tramping  German force should become aware of the presence of their puny foes and  should slaughter them against the merciless wires. It would not be a  fair stand-up fight, this murder-rush of hundreds of men against twelve  who were penned in and could not maneuver nor escape. And the thought  of it was doing queer things to the rookie's overwrought nerves.    Having passed the word to creep closer to the wires, he began to  execute the order in person, with no delay at all. But he was a  fraction of a second too late. The Germans were moving in  hike-formation with \"points\" thrown out in advance to either side--a  \"point\" being a private soldier who, for scouting and other purposes,  marches at some distance from the main body.    The point, ahead of the platoon, had swerved too far to the left, in  the blackness--an error that would infallibly have brought him up  against the wires, with considerable force, in another two steps. But  the Missourian was between him and the wires. And the point's  heavy-shod foot came down, heel first, on the back of the rookie's  out-groping hand. Such a crushing impact, on the hand-back, is one of  the most agonizing minor injuries a man can sustain. And this fact the  Missourian discovered with great suddenness.    His too-taut nerves forced from his throat a yell that split the  deathly stillness with an ear-piercing vehemence. He sprang to his  feet, forgetful of orders intent only on thrusting his bayonet through  the Hun who had caused such acute torture to his hand. Half way up, the  rookie's feet went out from under him in the slimy mud. He caromed  against the point, then fell headlong.    The German, doubtless thinking he had stumbled upon a single stray  American scout, whirled his own rifle aloft, to dash out the brains of  his luckless foe. But before the upflung butt could descend,--before  the rookie could rise or dodge,--the point added his quota to the rude  breaking of the night's silence. He screamed in panic terror, dropped  his brandished gun and reeled backward, clawing at his own throat.    For out of the eerie darkness, something had launched itself at  him--something silent and terrible, that had flown to the Missourian's  aid. Down with a crash went the German, on his back. He rolled against  the Missourian, who promptly sought to grapple with him.    But even as he clawed for the German, the rookie's nerves wrung from  him a second yell--this time less of rage than of horror.    \"Sufferin' cats!\" he bellowed. \"Why didn't anybody ever tell me Germans  was covered with fur instead of clothes?\"    The boche platoon was no longer striding along in hike-formation. It  was broken up into masses of wildly running men, all of them bearing  down upon the place whence issued this ungodly racket and turmoil.  Stumbling, reeling, blindly falling and rising again, they came on.    Some one among them loosed a rifle-shot in the general direction of the  yelling. A second and a third German rifleman followed the example of  the first. From the distant American trenches, one or two snipers began  to pepper away toward the enemy lines, though the fog was too thick for  them, to see the German rifle-flashes.    The boches farthest to the left, in the blind rush, fouled with the  wires. German snipers, from behind the Hun parapets, opened fire. A  minute earlier the night had been still as the grave. Now it fairly  vibrated with clangor. All because one rookie's nerves had been less  staunch than his courage, and because that same rookie had not only had  his hand stepped on in the dark, but had encountered something swirling  and hairy when he grabbed for the soldier who had stepped on him!      The American lieutenant, at the onset of the clamor, sprang to his  feet, whipping out his pistol; his dry lips parted in a command to  charge--a command which, naturally, would have reduced his eleven men  and himself to twelve corpses or to an equal number of mishandled  prisoners within the next few seconds. But a big hand was clapped  unceremoniously across the young officer's mouth, silencing the  half-spoken suicidal order.    Sergeant Mahan's career in the regular army had given him an almost  uncanny power of sizing up his fellowmen. And he had long ago decided  that this was the sort of thing his untried lieutenant would be likely  to do, in just such an emergency. Wherefore his flagrant breach of  discipline in shoving his palm across the mouth of his superior officer.    And as he was committing this breach of discipline, he heard the  Missourian's strangled gasp of:    \"Why didn't anybody ever tell me Germans was covered with fur?\"    In a flash Mahan understood. Wheeling, he stooped low and flung out  both arms in a wide-sweeping circle.

And a good lively collie pup could  put that bit of taxidermy out of commission in less than five seconds.  She knows, now, she mustn't touch it.\"    He spoke smugly; his lore on the subject being bounded by his  experiences in teaching Lad the simple Law of the Place. Lad was one of  the rare dogs to whom a single command or prohibition was enough to fix  a lesson in his uncannily wise brain for life. Lady was not. As the  Master soon had occasion to learn.    Late one afternoon, a week afterward, the Mistress had set forth on a  round of neighborhood calls. She had gone in the car; and had taken Lad  along. The Master, being busy and abhorring calls, had stayed at home.  He was at work in his study; and Lady was drowsing in the cool lower  hall.    A few minutes before the Mistress was due to return for dinner, a whiff  of acrid smoke was wafted to the man's nostrils.    Now, to every dweller in the country, there is one all-present peril;  namely, fire. And, the fear of this is always lurking worriedly in the  back of a rural householder's brain. A vagrant breath of smoke, in the  night, is more potent to banish sleep and to start such a man to  investigating his house and grounds than would be any and every other  alarm known to mortals.    Even now, in broad daylight, the faint reek was enough to bring the  Master's mind back to earth and the Master's body to its feet.  Sniffing, he went out to find the cause of the smell. The chimneys and  the roof and the windows of the house showing no sign of smoke, he  explored farther; and presently located the odor's origin in a small  brush-fire at some distance behind the stables. Two of the men were  raking pruned vine-suckers and leaves onto the blaze. The wind set away  from the house and stables. There was nothing to worry over. Ashamed of  his own fussiness, the Master went back to his work.    As he passed the open study window, on his way indoors, a motion inside  made him stop. He was just in time to see Lady trot into the room,  crouch playfully, and then spring full at the stuffed eagle.    His shout deflected the young dog's leap, and kept her merrily  outstretched jaws from closing on the bird. As it was, the impact  knocked the eagle and the papier-mache stump to the floor; with much  clatter and dust.    The Master vaulted in through the window; arriving on the study floor  almost as soon as did the overthrown bird. Lady was slinking out into  the hall; crestfallen and scared. The Master collared her and brought  her back to the scene of her mischief.    The collie had disobeyed him. Flagrantly she had sinned in assailing  the bird; after his injunction of \"Let it alone!\" There could be no  doubt, from her wriggling aspect of guilt, that she knew she was doing  wrong. Worse, she had taken sneaky advantage of his absence in order to  spring at the eagle. And disgust warred with the Master's normal  indignation.    Speaking as quietly as he could bring himself to speak, he told Lady  what she had done and what a rotten thing it had been. As he talked to  the utterly crestfallen pup, he was ransacking a drawer of his desk in  search of a dogwhip he had put there long ago and had never had  occasion to use.    Presently, he found it. Pointing to the overthrown trophy, he brought  the lash down across the shrinking collie's loins. He did not strike  hard. But he struck half a dozen times; and with glum knowledge that it  was the only course to take.    Never before in her eight foolish months of life, had Lady known the  meaning of a blow. While the whip-slashes were too light to do more  than sting her well-mattressed back, yet the humiliation of them seared  deep into her sensitive nature. No sound did she utter. But she cowered  flat to the floor; and trembled as if in a hard chill.    The whipping was over, in a few seconds. Again the Master explained to  her what it had been inflicted for. Then, calling her to follow, he led  the way out of doors and toward the stables. Stomach to earth, the  shamed and miserable Lady writhed along, close at his heels.    The Master passed the stables and walked toward the brush fire, where  the two men were still at work. But he did not go within a hundred feet  of the fire. Turning, after he had left the stables behind him, he made  for the tool-house.    Lady saw whither he was bound. She ceased to follow. Wheeling about,  she trotted stealthily back toward the stables. Reaching the tool-house  door, the Master opened it and whistled to the unhappy young collie.  Lady was nowhere in sight. At a second summons, she appeared from  around the corner of the stables; moving close to the ground, and with  many wriggles of protest. Twice, she stopped; and looked appealingly at  the man.    The Master hardened his soul against the prettily pathetic appeal in  her eyes and actions; and called her to him again. His own momentary  anger against the luckless youngster was gone,--the more so since the  eagle had not been damaged by its fall,--but he knew it was needful to  impress strongly on Lady the fact of her punishment. This for her own  sake as much as for his; since a housedog is worthless until it learns  that each and every indoor object must be respected and held sacred  from mutilation.    Wherefore, he was minded to spare Lady from any future punishment by  making this present lesson sink deep into her brain. Disregarding her  manifest aversion for the tool-house, he motioned her into it and shut  the door behind her.    \"You'll stay there, till morning,\" he told her, as he closed the window  and glanced in at the forlorn little wisp of fur and misery. \"You'll be  comfortable. And the open spaces under the roof will give you all the  air you want. I don't dare leave this window open, for fear you might  be able to jump out. You've had your supper. And there's a pan of fresh  water in there. You'll be no worse off there than you were all winter.  A night in jail may teach you to be a decent, house-broke dog; and not  a mutt.\"    As he was on the way back to his study, in the sunset, the car came  down the drive, bearing the Mistress. Lad was seated in solemn joy on  the front seat, at her side. The big collie loved motoring. And, as a  rule, he was relegated to the back seat. But when the Mistress went out  alone, his was the tremendously-enjoyed privilege of sitting in front,  beside her.    \"I had to lick Lady,\" reported the Master, shamefacedly, as he helped  his wife from the car. \"She went for the eagle in my study. You  remember how I scolded her for that, last week, don't you? Well, that's  all the good it did. And I had to whip her. I hated to. I'm glad you  weren't here to look unhappy about it. Then I shut her up for the night  in the tool-house. She--\"    He broke off, to look at Lad.    As the collie had jumped down from the car and had started toward the  house, he had struck Lady's trail; and he had followed it. It had led  him to the tool-house. Finding Lady was locked inside and unhappy, he  had come galloping back to the Master.    Standing in front of the man, and whining softly, he was scanning the  faces of his two deities with troubled eagerness. Evidently, he  considered that Lady had been locked in by mistake; and he was pleading  for her release. As these humans did not seem to catch the idea his  eyes and expression conveyed, he trotted a few steps toward the  tool-house and then paused to look invitingly back at them.    Twice he did this. Then, coming up to the Master, he caught the  latter's coat-hem lightly between his teeth and tugged on it as he  backed toward the tool-house.    \"No, old friend,\" said the Master, petting the silken head so  appealingly upraised to him. \"I know what you're getting at. But I  can't let her out. Tomorrow morning. Not till then. Come on up to  dinner.\"    Unwillingly and with wistful backward looks, Lad followed the Mistress  and the Master to the house and into the dining room and to his wonted  place on the floor at the Master's left side. But, more than once  during the meal, the man caught the collie's eyes fixed on him in  worried supplication; and was hard put to it not to grant the plea  which fairly clamored in his chum's mute gaze.    After dinner, when the Mistress and the Master set off on their usual  evening walk, Lad was not on hand to accompany them. As a rule, he was  all around them and in front and behind, in a series of gay rushes, as  they started on these walks. But not until the Master called him,  tonight, did he appear. And then he came up dolorously from the  tool-house.    Lad did not understand, at all, what was wrong. He knew only that Lady  had been shut up in a place she detested and that she was horribly  unhappy and that the Master would not let her out. It perplexed him;  and it made him increasingly wretched. Not only did he miss his  playfully capricious young mate, but her unhappiness made him heartsick.    Vainly, he tried to plead with the Master for her release, as the walk  began; and again at its end.    There were such a lot of things in the world that even the cleverest  collie could not make head or tail of! And most of these things were  sad.    That night, when the house was shut, Lad crept as usual into his cave  under the piano. And he lay down with a sigh, his great head between  his two absurdly small white forepaws. As a rule, before going to sleep  for the night, Lad used to spend much time in licking those same snowy  forepaws into shining cleanliness. The paws were his one gross vanity;  and he wasted more than an hour a day in keeping them spotlessly white.  But tonight he was too depressed to think of anything but the  whimpering little dog imprisoned down in the tool-house.    After a while, he "]]]
