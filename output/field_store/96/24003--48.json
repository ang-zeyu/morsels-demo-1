An ancient Banner of the Earl of Leicester  (H. 3) is white and red, the division being made by a vertical indented  line; No. 14. This design, however, was not the coat of arms of the  earl. The Shield of the ducal House of Brittany, closely connected with  the Royal Family of England, is simply of the fur ermine; No. 15. The  Shield of Waldegrave is silver and red, as in No. 16: and that of Fitz  Warine (H. 3), also of silver and red, is treated as in No. 17.      [Illustration: No. 13.--Banner of Templars.]      [Illustration: No. 14.--Banner of Leicester.]      [Illustration: No. 15.--Brittany.]      [Illustration: No. 16.--Waldegrave.]      [Illustration: No. 17.--Fitz Warine.]      [Illustration: No. 18.--Shield at Whitworth.]    Some of the earliest of the simple devices of true Heraldry were  evidently adopted from the _structural formation_ (or from a _structural  strengthening_) of the Shields, on which they were displayed. Thus,  a raised border, and bands of metal variously disposed in order to  impart additional strength to a shield, with distinct colouring, would  produce a series of heraldic compositions. A good example occurs in the  shield of an early Effigy at Whitworth, Durham, No. 18, in which the  heads of the rivets or screws employed to fix the border on the shield,  appear to have been made to assume the character of heraldic additions  to the simple border and horizontal bands. Other primary devices of the  same simple order, which in like manner may have had a structural  origin, I shall consider in detail in subsequent chapters. (See  particularly Chapter VI.)    The central boss, at once an appropriate ornament of an early shield,  and an important addition to its defensive qualities, when extended in  the form of decorative metal-work, would readily suggest a variety of  heraldic figures, and amongst others several beautiful modifications of  a simple cruciform device which it might be made to assume. The figure  called an escarbuncle, No. 19, is simply a shield-boss developed into  decorative structural metal-work. This figure appears in the Temple  Church, London, upon the shield of an Effigy, which Mr. J. Gough Nichols  has shown to have been incorrectly attributed to Geoffrey de Mandeville,  Earl of Essex.      [Illustration: No. 19.--The Escarbuncle.]    The greater number of the earliest devices that appear in English  Heraldry were adopted for the express purpose of their having some  _allusive association_, through a similarity of sound in their own names  or descriptions with the names and titles or the territories of certain  persons, dignities, and places. In exact accordance with the principles  and aim of primitive mediæval Heraldry, and in perfect harmony with the  sentiments and requirements of the age in which it grew up into a  science, devices of this kind addressed themselves in very plain and  expressive language to the men of their own era. In them they saw the  kind of symbolical writing that they could remember, as well as  understand. They also evidently liked the quaint style of suggestiveness  that was a characteristic of these allusive devices: and, it is more  than probable that there frequently lurked in them a humorous  significance, which by no means tended to detract from their popularity.  Devices of this same order have never ceased to be in favour with  Heralds and lovers of Heraldry. They were used in the sixteenth century  at least as commonly as in the thirteenth; but, as would be expected, in  the later period they often became complicated, far-fetched, and  extravagant.    This allusive quality, distinguished in English Heraldry as \"_canting_,\"  has commonly been misunderstood, and therefore incorrectly estimated, by  modern writers, who have supposed it to be a fantastic conceit of the  Heralds of a degenerate age. By writers such as these, accordingly, all  \"_canting arms_\" (by French Heralds called \"_armes parlantes_\") have  been absurdly assigned to a separate class, in their estimation having  an inferior heraldic grade.    The prevalence of the allusive quality in early arms may be assumed to  have been even more general than is now apparent, since so many of the  original echoes and allusions have become obscured or altogether lost in  the lapse of time, and through the changes that have taken place since  the accession of HENRY III. in the French language and in our own also.  The use of the Latin language, again, in the Middle Ages led, at later  periods, to translations of names; French names, too, were translated in  the same manner into English equivalents: and, at other times, the sound  of a Latin or a French (Anglo-Norman) name was transferred to an English  representative having a somewhat similar sound, without the slightest  reference to the original signification. Who, for example, in the name  of MONTAGU now recognises instinctively the original allusion to a  _mountain_ with its _sharply_ peaked crests, and so discerns the  probable allusive origin of the _sharp_ triple points of the devices on  the old Montacute shield, No. 20? It is easy to see how much must have  been unconsciously done, by such changes in names and their  associations, to obliterate what once was clear, significant, and  expressive. I must be content here to give, simply by way of explanatory  illustration, a very few examples of allusive arms; and, in so doing, it  may be well for me to observe that the early Heralds of our country  always employed the French language as it was spoken in their own times  in England as well as in France. In the time of HENRY III., G. de Lucy  has for his arms _three lucies_--fish now known as pike: Robert Quency  has a _quintefueil_--a flower of five leaves: Thos. Corbett has _two  corbeaux_--ravens: A. de Swyneburne has \"_trois testes de  senglier_\"--three heads of the wild boar, or _swine_: (E. 2), Sir R. de  Eschales has _six escallops_--_shells_: Sir G. de Trompintoun, of  Trumpington, near Cambridge, has _two trompes_--trumpets: Sir J. Bordoun  has _three bourdons_--pilgrim's staves: Sir G. Rossel has _three roses_:  and Sir O. Heron has the same number of _herons_. So also, for the  Spanish provinces Castile and Leon, a _castle_ and a _lion_: for  Falconer, a _falcon_: Butler, _cups_: Forester, _bugle-horns_: Arundel,  _hirondelles_--swallows: Wingfield, _wings_: Shelley, _shells_: Pigot,  _pick-axes_: Leveson, _leaves_: and Martel, _martels_--hammers. The  _Broom-plant_ with its seed-pods, in Latin _Planta genista_, No. 21,  gave its name to the PLANTAGENET Dynasty. I shall hereafter add several  other curious examples of devices of this class, when treating of  _Badges_, _Rebuses_, and _Mottoes_.      [Illustration: No. 20.--Shield of Montacute.]      [Illustration: No. 21.--Planta Genista.]      [Illustration: No. 22.--WILLIAM I.]      [Illustration: No. 23.--Saxon Princes.]    There is one class of early arms, which it is important that students of  Armory should observe with especial care, lest they be led by them into  unexpected errors. These are arms that were invented _after_ Heraldry  had been established, and then were assigned to personages of historical  eminence who had lived and died _before_ the true heraldic era. In the  days in which every person of prominence bore heraldic arms, and when  Heraldry had attained to high renown, it was natural enough to consider  that suitable armorial devices and compositions should be assigned to  the men of mark in earlier ages, both to distinguish them in accordance  with the usage then prevalent, and to treat their memory with becoming  honour. Such arms were also in a sense necessary to their descendants  for the purposes of quartering. No proof can be shown that the arms said  to have been borne by WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR are not of this order--made  for him, that is, and attributed to him in after times, but of which he  himself had no knowledge. These arms, No. 22, differ from the true Royal  Insignia of England only in there being _two_, instead of _three_, lions  displayed upon the shield. The arms of EDWARD THE CONFESSOR, No. 2, were  certainly devised long after his death, and they appear to have been  suggested to the heralds of HENRY III. by one of the Confessor's coins:  the shield is blue, and the cross and five birds (martlets) are gold. In  like manner, the arms attributed to the earlier Saxon Sovereigns of  England, No. 23, a gold cross upon blue, are really not earlier than the  thirteenth century. The arms, No. 2, having been assigned to ST. EDWARD,  a patron saint of mediæval England, were long regarded with peculiar  reverence. I have placed them, drawn from a fine shield of the  thirteenth century in Westminster Abbey, to take a part in forming a  group at the head of my Preface, with the shields of the two other  saintly Patrons of \"old England,\" ST. GEORGE and ST. EDMUND, No. 1 and  No. 3--a red cross on a silver shield, and three golden crowns upon a  shield of blue.          CHAPTER III      _The English Heraldry that is now in existence-- First Debasement    of Heraldry-- Later Debasement-- Revival of English Heraldry--    Heraldic Art._      \"Sans changer.\"      --MOTTO OF STANLEY.      English Heraldry, as it exists amongst us in our own times, is the very  same Heraldry that flourished under the kindly influences of the  greatest of the Plantagenets, though perhaps modified in some details by  changed circumstances. It is not of a new, but of the old, Heraldry of  England that I am setting forth the elements. Our Heraldry has had to  pass from good days to bad ones: and, having gone through the worst of  bad days, the circle at length has revolved, so that we are witnessing  the happy change of a vigorous heraldic revival.

A part of the road, as far as  Buffalo Gap, I passed over in the summer of 1840, on my return to St.  Louis, after bringing you home. If any one had then told me that the  next time I travelled that road would have been on my present errand, I  should have supposed him insane. I enjoyed the mountains, as I rode  along. The views are magnificent--the valleys so beautiful, the scenery  so peaceful. What a glorious world Almighty God has given us. How  thankless and ungrateful we are, and how we labour to mar his gifts. I  hope you received my letters from Richmond. Give love to daughter and  Mildred. I did not see Rob as I passed through Charlottesville. He was  at the University and I could not stop.\"    A few days later there is another letter:    \"Camp at Valley Mountain, August 9, 1861.    \"I have been here, dear Mary, three days, coming from Monterey to  Huntersville and thence here. We are on the dividing ridge looking north  down the Tygart's river valley, whose waters flow into the Monongahela  and South towards the Elk River and Greenbriar, flowing into the  Kanawha. In the valley north of us lie Huttonsville and Beverly,  occupied by our invaders, and the Rich Mountains west, the scene of our  former disaster, and the Cheat Mountains east, their present stronghold,  are in full view.    \"The mountains are beautiful, fertile to the tops, covered with the  richest sward of bluegrass and white clover, the inclosed fields  waving with the natural growth of timothy. The inhabitants are few and  population sparse. This is a magnificent grazing country, and all it  needs is labour to clear the mountain-sides of its great growth of  timber. There surely is no lack of moisture at this time. It has rained,  I believe, some portion of every day since I left Staunton. Now it  is pouring, and the wind, having veered around to every point of the  compass, has settled down to the northeast. What that portends in these  regions I do not know. Colonel Washington [John Augustin Washington,  great-nephew of General Washington, and Mt. Vernon's last owner bearing  that name], Captain Taylor, and myself are in one tent, which as yet  protects us. I have enjoyed the company of Fitzhugh since I have been  here. He is very well and very active, and as yet the war has not  reduced him much. He dined with me yesterday and preserves his fine  appetite. To-day he is out reconnoitering and has the full benefit of  this rain. I fear he is without his overcoat, as I do not recollect  seeing it on his saddle. I told you he had been promoted to a major in  cavalry, and is the commanding cavalry officer on this line at present.  He is as sanguine, cheerful, and hearty as ever. I sent him some  corn-meal this morning and he sent me some butter--a mutual interchange  of good things. There are but few of your acquaintances in this army.  I find here in the ranks of one company Henry Tiffany. The company is  composed principally of Baltimoreans--George Lemmon and Douglas Mercer  are in it. It is a very fine company, well drilled and well instructed.  I find that our friend, J. J. Reynolds, of West Point memory, is  in command of the troops immediately in front of us. He is a  brigadier-general. You may recollect him as the Assistant Professor  of Philosophy, and lived in the cottage beyond the west gate, with  his little, pale-faced wife, a great friend of Lawrence and Markie. He  resigned on being relieved from West Point, and was made professor of  some college in the West. Fitzhugh was the bearer of a flag the other  day, and he recognised him. He was very polite and made inquiries of us  all. I am told they feel very safe and are very confident of success.  Their numbers are said to be large, ranging from 12,000 to 30,000, but  it is impossible for me to get correct information either as to their  strength or position. Our citizens beyond this are all on their side.  Our movements seem to be rapidly communicated to them, while theirs come  to us slowly and indistinctly. I have two regiments here, with others  coming up. I think we shall shut up this road to the Central Railroad  which they strongly threaten. Our supplies come up slowly. We have  plenty of beef and can get some bread. I hope you are well and are  content. I have heard nothing of you or the children since I left  Richmond. You must write there.... The men are suffering from the  measles, etc., as elsewhere, but are cheerful and light-hearted. The  atmosphere, when it is not raining, is delightful. You must give much  love to daughter and 'Life' [Pet names for his two daughters, Mary and  Mildred]. I want to see you all very much, but I know not when that  can be. May God guard and protect you all. In Him alone is our hope.  Remember me to Ned [M. Edward Carter Turner, of Kinloch, my father's  cousin] and all at 'Kinloch' and Avenel [The house of the Berbeleys, in  Fauquier County]. Send word to Miss Lou Washington [Eldest daughter  of John Augustin Washington] that her father is sitting on his blanket  sewing the strap on his haversack. I think she out to be here to do it.  Always yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    In a letter to his two daughters who were in Richmond, he writes:    \"Valley Mountain, August 29, 1861.    \"My Precious Daughters: I have just received your letters of the 24th  and am rejoiced to hear that you are well and enjoying the company of  your friends.... It rains here all the time, literally. There has not  been sunshine enough since my arrival to dry my clothes. Perry [his  servant--had been in the dining-room at Arlington] is my washerman, and  socks and towels suffer. But the worst of the rain is that the ground  has become so saturated with water that the constant travel on the roads  has made them almost impassable, so that I cannot get up sufficient  supplies for the troops to move. It is raining now. Has been all day,  last night, day before, and day before that, etc., etc. But we must be  patient. It is quite cool, too. I have on all my winter clothes and am  writing in my overcoat. All the clouds seem to concentrate over this  ridge of mountains, and by whatever wind they are driven, give us rain.  The mountains are magnificent. The sugar-maples are beginning to turn  already, and the grass is luxuriant.    \"'Richmond' [His horse] has not been accustomed to such fare or such  treatment. But he gets along tolerably, complains some, and has not much  superfluous flesh. There has been much sickness among the men--measles,  etc.--and the weather has been unfavourable. I hope their attacks are  nearly over, and that they will come out with the sun. Our party has  kept well.... Although we may be too weak to break through the lines, I  feel well satisfied that the enemy cannot at present reach Richmond by  either of these routes, leading to Staunton, Milborough or Covington.  He must find some other way.... God Bless you, my children, and preserve  you from all harm is the constant prayer of    \"Your devoted father,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    On account of rheumatism, my mother was anxious to go to the Hot  Springs in Bath County. She was now staying at \"Audley,\" Clarke County,  Virginia, with Mrs. Lorenzo Lewis, who had just sent her six sons into  the army. Bath County was not very far from the seat of war in western  Virginia, and my father was asked as to the safety of the Hot Springs  from occupation by the enemy. He writes as follows to my mother:    \"Valley Mountain, September 1, 1861.    \"I have received, dearest Mary, your letter of August 18th from Audley,  and am very glad to get news of your whereabouts.... I am very glad you  are enabled to see so many of your friends. I hope you have found all  well in your tour, and am very glad that our cousin Esther bears the  separation from all her sons so bravely. I have no doubt they will  do good service in our Southern cause, and wish they could be placed  according to their fancies.... I fear you have postponed your visit  to the Hot too late. It must be quite cold there now, judging from the  temperature here, and it has been raining in these mountains since July  24th.... I see Fitzhugh quite often, though he is encamped four miles  from me. He is very well and not at all harmed by the campaign.    \"We have a great deal of sickness among the soldiers, and now those  on the sick-list would form an army. The measles is still among them,  though I hope it is dying out. But it is a disease which though light  in childhood is severe in manhood, and prepares the system for other  attacks. The constant cold rains, with no shelter but tents, have  aggravated it. All these drawbacks, with impassable roads, have  paralysed our efforts. Still I think you will be safe at the Hot, for  the present. We are right up to the enemy on three lines, and in the  Kanawha he has been pushed beyond the Gauley.... My poor little Rob I  never hear from scarcely. He is busy, I suppose, and knows not where to  direct....    \"With much affection,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    From the same camp, to my mother, on September 9th:    \"...I hope from the tone of your letter that you feel better, and wish I  could see you and be with you. I trust we may meet this fall somewhere,  if only for a little time. I have written to Robert telling him if,  after considering what I have previously said to him on the subject of  his joining the company he desires under Major Ross, he still thinks it  best for him to do so, I will not withhold my consent. It seems he will  be eighteen; I thought seventeen. I am unable to judge for him and he  must decide for himself. In reply to a recent letter from him to me on  the same subject, I said to him all I could. I pray God to bring him  to the right conclusion.... For military news, I must refer you to the  papers. You will see there more than ever occurs, and what does occur  the relation must be taken with some allowance. Do not believe anything"]]]
