With  the water once fairly brought under control, and the pond deep enough  to afford a refuge from enemies, the young pair could be trusted to  complete it by themselves, get their house ready, and gather their  supplies in for the winter. The Boy concluded to his own satisfaction  that what he was now watching was the analogue, in beaver life, to one  of those \"house-raising\" bees which sometimes took place in the  Settlement, when the neighbours would come together to help a man get  up the frame of a new house. Only, as it seemed to him, the beavers  were a more serious and more sober folk than the men.    When this wilderness engineering had progressed for an hour under the  watchers' eyes, Jabe began to grow very tired. The strain of physical  immobility told upon him, and he lost interest. He began to feel that  he knew all about dam-building; and as there was nothing more to learn  he wanted to go back to camp. He glanced anxiously at the young face  beside him--but there he could see no sign of weariness. The Boy was  aglow with enthusiasm. He had forgotten everything but the wonderful  little furry architects, their diligence, their skill, their  cooperation, and the new pond there growing swiftly before his eyes.  Already it was more than twice as wide as when they had arrived on the  scene; the dam was a good eight inches higher; and the clamour of the  flowing stream was stopped. No, Jabe could see no sympathy for himself  in that eager face. He was ashamed to beg off. And moreover, he was  loyal to his promise of obedience. The Boy, here, was Captain.    Suppressing a sigh, Jabe stealthily and very gradually shifted to an  easier position, so stealthily that the Boy beside him did not know he  had moved. Then, fixing his eyes once more upon the beavers, he tried  to renew his interest in them. As he stared, he began to succeed  amazingly. And no wonder! The beavers all at once began to do such  amazing things. There were many more of them than he had thought; and  he was sure he heard them giving orders in something that sounded to  him like the Micmac tongue. He could not believe his ears. Then he saw  that they were using larger stones, instead of mud and turf, in their  operations--and floating them down the pond as if they were corks. He  had never heard of such a thing before, in all his wilderness  experience. He was just about to compliment the Boy on this  unparalleled display of engineering skill, when one particularly large  beaver, who was hoisting a stone as big as himself up the face of the  dam, let his burden slip a little. Then began a terrible struggle  between the beaver and the stone. In his agonizing effort--which his  companions all stopped work to watch--the unhappy beaver made a loud,  gurgling, gasping noise; then, without a hint of warning, dropped the  stone with a splash, turned like lightning, and grabbed Jabe violently  by the arm.    The astonishing scene changed in a twinkling; and Jabe realized that  the Boy was shaking him.    \"A nice one to watch beavers, you are!\" cried the Boy, angry and  disappointed.    \"Why--where've they all gone to?\" demanded Jabe, rubbing his eyes.  \"They're the most interestin' critters I ever hearn tell of!\"    \"Interesting!\" retorted the Boy, scornfully. \"So interesting you went  to sleep! And you snored so they thought it was an earthquake. Not  another beaver'll show a hair round here to-night. We'd better go  home!\"    Jabe grinned sheepishly, but answered never a word; and silently, in  Indian file, the Boy leading, the two took the trail back to camp.          CHAPTER VI    The Peril of the Traps      AT breakfast next morning the Boy had quite recovered his good humour,  and was making merry at Jabe's expense. The latter, who was, of  course, defenceless and abashed, was anxious to give him something new  to think of.    \"Say,\" he exclaimed suddenly, after the Boy had prodded him with a  searching jibe. \"If ye'll let up on that snore, now, I'll take a day  off from my cruisin', and show ye somethin' myself.\"    \"Good!\" said the Boy. \"It's a bargain. What will you show me?\"    \"I'll take ye over to one of _my_ ponds, in next valley, an' show ye  all the different ways of _trappin'_ beaver.\"    The Boy's face fell.    \"But what do _I_ care about _trapping_ beaver?\" he cried. \"You know I  wouldn't trap anything. If I had to kill anything, I'd _shoot_ it,  and put it out of misery as quick as I could!\"    \"I know all that,\" responded Jabe. \"But trappin' is somethin' ye want  to _understand_, all the same. Ye can't be an all-round woodsman 'less  ye _understand_ trappin'. An' moreover, there's some things ye learn  about wild critters in tryin' to git the better of 'em that ye can't  learn no other way.\"    \"I guess you're right, Jabe!\" answered the Boy, slowly. Knowledge he  would have, whether he liked the means of getting it or not. But the  woodsman's next words relieved him.    \"I'll just show ye _how_, that's all!\" said Jabe. \"It's a leetle too  airly in the season yit fur actual trappin'. An' moreover, it's agin  the law. Agin the law, an' agin common sense, too, fer the fur ain't  no good, so to speak, fer a month yit. When the law an' common sense  stand together, then I'm fer the law. Come on!\"    Picking up his axe, he struck straight back into the woods, in a  direction at right angles to the brook. To uninitiated eyes there was  no trail; but to Jabe, and to the Boy no less, the path was like a  trodden highway. The pace set by the backwoodsman, with his long,  slouching, loose-jointed, flat-footed stride, was a stiff one, but  the Boy, who was lean and hard, and used his feet straight-toed like  an Indian, had no fault to find with it. Neither spoke a word, as they  swung along single file through the high-arched and ancient forest,  whose shadows, so sombre all through summer, were now shot here and  there with sharp flashes of scarlet or pale gleams of aerial gold.  Once, rounding a great rock of white granite stained with faint  pinkish and yellowish reflections from the bright leaves glowing over  it, they came face to face with a tall bull moose, black and  formidable-looking as some antediluvian monster. The monster, however,  had no desire to hold the way against them. He eyed them doubtfully  for a second, and then went crashing off through the brush in frank,  undignified alarm.    For a good three miles the travellers swung onward, up a slow long  slope, and down a longer, slower one into the next valley. The Boy  noted that the region was one of numberless small brooks flowing  through a comparatively level land, with old, long-deserted  beaver-meadows interspersed among wooded knolls. Yet for a time there  were no signs of the actual living beavers. He asked the reason, and  Jabe said:    \"It's been all trapped over an' over, years back, when beaver  pelts was high,--an' by Injuns, likely, who just cleaned out  everythin',--an' broke down the dams,--an' dug out the houses. But  the little critters is comin' back. Furder up the valley there's some  good ponds now!\"    \"And now they'll be cleaned out again!\" exclaimed the Boy, with a rush  of indignant pity.    \"Not on yer life!\" answered Jabe. \"We don't do things that way now. We  don't play low-down tricks on 'em an' clean out a whole family, but  jest take so many out of each beaver house, an' then leave 'em alone  two er three years to kinder recooperate!\"    As Jabe finished they came in sight of a long, rather low dam, with a  pond spread out beyond it that was almost worthy to be called a lake.  It was of comparatively recent creation, as the Boy's observant eye  decided at once from the dead trees still rising here and there from  the water.    \"Gee!\" he exclaimed, under his breath. \"That's a great pond, Jabe!\"    \"There's no less'n four beaver houses in that pond!\" said the  woodsman, with an air of proud possession. \"That makes, accordin' to  my reckonin', anywheres from thirty to thirty-six beaver. Bye and bye,  when the time comes, I'll kinder thin 'em out a bit, that's all!\"    From the crest of the dam all four houses--one far out and three close  to shore--were visible to the Boy's initiated eye; though strangers  might have taken them to be mere casual accumulations of sticks  deposited by some whimsical freshet. It troubled him to think how many  of the architects of these cunningly devised dwellings would soon have  to yield up their harmless and interesting lives; but he felt no  mission to attempt a reform of humanity's taste for furs, so he did  not allow himself to become sentimental on the subject. Beavers, like  men, must take fate as it comes; and he turned an attentive ear to  Jabe's lesson.    \"Ye know, of course,\" said the woodsman, \"the steel trap we use. We  ain't got no use fer the tricks of the Injuns, though I'm goin' to  tell ye all _them_, in good time. An' we ain't much on new-fangled  notions, neether. But the old, smooth-jawed steel-trap, what kin  _hold_ when it gits a grip, an' not tear the fur, is good enough for  us.\"    \"Yes, I know all your traps, of all the sizes you use, from muskrat up  to bear!\" interrupted the Boy. \"What size do you use for the beaver?\"    \"Number four,\" answered Jabe. \"Jaw's got a spread of six and one-half  inches or thereabouts. But it's all in the where an' the how ye set  yer trap!\"    \"And that's what I want to know about!\" said the Boy. \"But why don't  you _shoot_ the poor little beggars? That's quicker for both, and just  as easy for you, ain't it?\"    \"T'ain't no use _shootin'_ a beaver, leastways not in the water! He  just sinks like a stone. No, ye've _got_ to trap him, to _git_ him.  Now, supposin' you was goin' to trap, where would ye set the traps?\"    \"I'd anchor them just in the entrances to their houses,\" answered the  Boy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#8)"],[1,"a supposed breeding  ground in Franz Josef Land, because of the numbers of the birds, but  found no nests.      62. SABINE'S GULL. _Xema sabinii._    Range.--Arctic regions, breeding from Alaska and Greenland and  northward, and wintering south to New England.    A handsome bird, having the slaty hood bordered behind with a black  ring, the primaries black, white tipped, and the tail slightly forked.  They breed abundantly on the marshes of northern Alaska and Greenland,  nesting the same as others of the species. The two or three eggs are  laid in June. They are greenish brown in color and are marked with dark  brown. Size 1.75 x 1.25. Data.--Hudson Bay, August 1, 1894. Eggs laid on  the ground in the moss; no nest except the hollow in the moss.    [Illustration 051: Rose Gull. Sabine Gull.]  [Illustration: Greenish brown.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 50    63. GULL-BILLED TERN. _Gelochelidon nilotica._    Range.--Found in North America along the Gulf Coast and on the Atlantic  Coast north to Virginia and casually farther.    This is one of the largest of the Terns, is 14 inches long, has a short,  thick, black bill and a short slightly forked tail; the crown is black,  mantle pearly gray, white below. This species is very widely  distributed, being found in Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. They are  known locally as \"Marsh Terns\" where they breed in immense numbers on  some of the marshes about the Gulf, particularly in Texas. They also  breed on many of the islands along the Coast, rarely making any nest,  but laying the eggs in a hollow in the sand. They nest most abundantly  in the latter part of May, generally laying three eggs. They are of a  yellowish, grayish or greenish buff color and are spotted with brown and  lilac. Size 1.80 x 1.30. Data.--Northampton Co., Va., May 28, 1882.  Three eggs laid on a mass of seaweed on marsh above tide water.      64. CASPIAN TERN. _Sterna caspia._    Range.--Like the preceding species, this bird is nearly cosmopolitan in  its range, in North America breeding from the Gulf Coast and Texas  northward to the Arctic Regions.    This beautiful bird is the largest of the Tern family, being about 22  inches in length, with the tail forked about 1.5 inches. The bill is  large, heavy and bright red; the crest, with which this and the next  three species are adorned, is black. The mantle is pale pearl and the  under parts white. These Terns sometimes nest in large colonies and then  again only a few pairs will be found on an island. In Texas, the  breeding season commences in May, it being later in the more northern  breeding grounds. They may be regarded as largely eastern birds, as  while they are common in the interior of the country, they are rarely  found on the Pacific Coast. Two or three eggs constitute a complete set;  these are laid on the sand in a slight hollow scooped out by the birds.  They vary from gray to greenish buff, marked with brown and lilac. Size  2.60 x 1.75. Data.--Hat Island, Lake Michigan, July 1, 1896. No nest.  Two eggs in a hollow in the gravel. Fully a thousand terns nesting on  about one acre. Collector, Charles L. Cass.    [Illustration 052: Pale greenish buff.]  [Illustration: Grayish buff.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 51    65. ROYAL TERN. _Sterna maxima._    Range.--Temperate North and South America, breeding in the United States  locally from Texas and the Gulf States northward to the northern  boundary of the United States.    The Royal Terns nest in great numbers on the coasts and islands on the  South Atlantic and Gulf States and in the marshes of southern Texas.  Like the former species they lay two or three eggs in a hollow on the  bare sand. The eggs are the same size but differ in being more pointed  and having a lighter ground and with the markings more bold and  distinct. Size 2.60 x 1.70.      66. ELEGANT TERN. _Sterna elegans._    Range.--Pacific Coast of South and Central America; north to California  in summer.    A similar bird to the Royal Tern, but easily distinguished by its  smaller size, slender bill, and more graceful form. In the breeding  plumage the under parts of these Terns are tinged with rosy, which  probably first gave the birds their name. They breed on the coasts and  islands of Mexico and Central America, placing their eggs on the sand.  They are believed to lay but a single egg, like that of the Royal Tern,  but smaller. Size 2.40 x 1.40. Data.--Honduras, Central America, June 5,  1899. Single egg laid on the sandy beach.    [Illustration 053: Gull-billed Tern. Caspian Tern. Royal Tern.]  [Illustration: Grayish buff.]  [Illustration: Cream color.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 52    67. CABOT TERN. _Sterna sandvicensis acuflavida._    Range.--A tropical species breeding regularly north to the Bahamas and  Florida; casually farther north. A beautiful bird distinguished from the  three preceding ones by its smaller size (sixteen inches) and by the  bill which is black with a yellow tip. They nest in colonies on the  shores of islands in the West Indies and Bahamas, but not to a great  extent on the United States Coast. Their two or three eggs have a creamy  ground color, and are boldly marked with brown and black. Size 2.10 x  1.40.      68. TRUDEAU'S TERN. _Sterna trudeaui._    Range.--South America; accidentally along the coast of the United  States.    A rare and unique species with a form similar to the following, but with  the coloration entirely different. About fifteen inches in length; tail  long and deeply forked; bill yellow with a band of black about the  middle. Whole head pure white, shading into the pearly color of the  upper and under parts. A narrow band of black through the eye and over  the ear coverts. A very rare species that is supposed to breed in  southern South America. Given a place among North American birds on the  strength of a specimen seen by Audubon off Long Island.    [Illustration 054: Elegant Tern. Cabot's Tern.]  [Illustration: Cream color.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 53    69. FORSTER'S TERN. _Sterna forsteri._    Range.--Temperate North America, breeding from Manitoba, Mass., and  California, south to the Gulf Coast and Texas.    Length about fifteen inches; tail long and deeply forked; crown black,  back and wings pearl and under parts white. Bill orange red. This  species and the three following are the most graceful of birds in  appearance and flight. Their movements can only be likened to those of  the Swallows, from which they get the name of \"Sea Swallows.\" Their food  consists of fish, which they get by diving, and marine insects. They  breed by thousands in the marshes from Manitoba to Texas and along the  South Atlantic coast. The eggs are laid in a hollow on the dry grassy  portions of the islands or marshes. They generally lay three eggs and  rarely four. They are buffy or brownish spotted with dark brown and  lilac. Size 1.80 x 1.30. Data.--Cobb's Island, Va., June 8, 1887. Eggs  in a hollow on grassy bank. Collector, F. H. Judson.      70. COMMON TERN. _Sterna hirundo._    Range.--Eastern North America, breeding both on the coast and in the  interior from the Gulf States northward.    This bird differs from the preceding chiefly in having a bright red bill  tipped with black, and the under parts washed with pearl. These are the  most common Terns on the New England coast, nesting abundantly from  Virginia to Newfoundland. These beautiful Terns, together with others of  the family, were formerly killed by thousands for millinery purposes,  but the practice is now being rapidly stopped. In May and June they lay  their three, or sometimes four eggs on the ground as do the other Terns.  They are similar to the preceding species but average shorter.  Data.--Duck Is., Maine, June 30, 1896. Three eggs in marsh grass about  fifty feet from beach. No nest. Collector, C. A. Reed.    [Illustration 055: Brownish buff.]  [Illustration: Forsters Tern. Common Tern.]  [Illustration: Buff.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 54    71. ARCTIC TERN. _Sterna paradisaea._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding from New England northward to the  Arctic Regions and wintering south to California and the South Atlantic  States. A similar bird to the last, differing in having the bill wholly  red and the feet being smaller and weak for the size of the bird. A more  northern bird than the last, breeding abundantly in Alaska, both on the  coast and in the interior. In the southern limits of its breeding range,  it nests in company with the Common Tern, its nests and eggs being  indistinguishable from the latter. When their nesting grounds are  approached, all the birds arise like a great white cloud, uttering their  harsh, discordant \"tearrr, tearrr,\" while now and then an individual,  bolder than the rest, will swoop close by with an angry \"crack.\" On the  whole they are timid birds, keeping well out of reach. The nesting  season is early in June. Eggs like the preceding. Data.--Little Duck  Is., Me., June 29, 1896. Three eggs in a slight hollow on the beach,  three feet above high water mark.      72. ROSEATE TERN. _Sterna dougalli._    Range.--Temperate North America on the east coast, breeding from New  England to the Gulf.    These are the most beautiful birds, having a delicate pink blush on the  under parts during the breeding season; the tail is very long and deeply  forked, the outer feathers being over five inches longer than the middle  ones; the bill is red with a black tip. They nest in large colonies on  the islands from Southern New England southward, placing the nests in  the short grass, generally without any lining. They lay two or three  eggs which are indistinguishable from the two preceding species.      73. ALEUTIAN TERN. _Sterna aleutica._    Range.--Found in summer in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.    South in winter to Japan. This handsome Tern is of the form"]]]
