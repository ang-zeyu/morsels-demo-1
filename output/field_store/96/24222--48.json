[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31234"],[0,"A History of the English Church in New Zealand (#8)"],[1," furniture and tools were carried off,  and the poor missionary was glad to return to his colleagues, and to  share the protection of the _tapu_ which Ruatara had placed upon their  settlement. Barren as Te Puna might be, it was a safe refuge, and so  long as the missionaries stayed there they suffered nothing worse from  the natives than a little pilfering and an occasional threat.      [1] The missionaries generally used the terms Te Puna and Rangihoua    indiscriminately.    Their real troubles arose within their own circle. The settlement  (including children) consisted of twenty-five people, and it was  organised by Marsden on what may be called a communistic basis. His  original plan had been for each settler to be allowed to trade with the  Maoris on his own account, and for this purpose he had given them a  stock of goods before leaving Sydney. This concession was intended to  compensate those who, like King and Hall, had given up large incomes on  leaving New South Wales. But a very short experience convinced Marsden  that such traffic was open to grave objections. With characteristic  promptitude he remodelled his scheme. Calling the settlers together, he  told them that he could allow no private trade whatever. All traffic  with the natives was to be carried on by the whole community, and the  profits were to go towards defraying the expenses of the mission.  Rations of food and other necessaries would be served out to the mission  families, and each settler would receive a small percentage on whatever  profit might accrue from the trading voyages of the brig.    These terms were not accepted without protest, but such was the weight  of Marsden's authority that they were at length adopted by all. The  scheme is interesting as foreshadowing the communism of Selwyn, and as  being the earliest example of socialism in white New Zealand. But all  such experiments need the constant presence of the inspiring mind, and  this is just what the Te Puna community lacked. Marsden did not return  for more than four years, and in the meantime the settlers were left  with no head whatever. Kendall was the cleverest of the group, and his  ambitious spirit chafed at the restrictions imposed by his distant  superior. He bore a commission of the Peace from the Governor of New  South Wales, but his magisterial powers were mostly exercised on runaway  sailors. In the mission his vote counted for no more than the vote of  King or of Hall.    For a time, indeed, the experiment promised well. Hall spoke in later  years of the \"zeal, warmth, and sanguinity\" with which they began their  work. Kendall was successful with the school, in which a son of the  noble Te Pahi acted as an assistant. One or two new settlers arrived  from Australia, and glowing reports reached the Committee in London.    But evil was at work. As early as 1816, Kendall was sending to Marsden  grave accusations against his colleagues. His letters were plausible and  carried weight. Quarrels arose between him and Hall, who was so wearied  with the \"difficulties, discouragements, and insults\" of his life that  he wished to retire from his post. The rules of the community were not  kept; the forbidden trade in firearms was not altogether avoided; the  early fervour cooled, and little mission work was done.    Marsden grieved over this sad declension, yet could not at once apply a  remedy. But in the early months of 1819 he had staying at his parsonage  a singularly devoted Methodist preacher whose health had broken down.  The chaplain suggested to his guest that he should try the effect of a  voyage to New Zealand, and should investigate the state of the Mission  there. Like a mediaeval bishop, Marsden called in the assistance of a  preaching order to infuse new life into his failing \"seculars.\" The  boldness of the plan was justified by the result. Mr. Leigh tactfully  mediated between the separated brethren; by prayer and exhortation he  rekindled their flagging zeal; and, Methodist-like, he drew up a \"plan\"  for their future operations. Soon after his departure King and Kendall  went on a missionary tour to Hokianga on the western coast; Hall boated  along the eastern coast, and preached as far as Whangaruru.    On the reception of Leigh's report, Marsden wrote a hopeful letter to  London. \"The place,\" he said, \"will now be changed, and I trust we shall  be able to lay down such rules and keep those who are employed in the  work to their proper duty, so as to prevent the existence of any great  differences among them.\" But he himself must initiate the changes, and  by August of that same year (1819) he was again at the Bay of Islands.  The meeting between himself and his catechists was marked by  satisfaction on both sides. Kendall and King could report hopefully of  their recent reception on the Hokianga River, which they were the first  white men to see; Hall could relate how he had found and forgiven the  people who had assaulted him at Waitangi, and how prosperous had been  his tour until he reached a _pa_ where the demand for iron was so great  that the inhabitants stole the rudder-hangings of his boat, and left the  poor missionary to find his way back as best he might in stormy weather  to the shelter of Rangihoua. Marsden, on his part, could introduce a  party of new helpers whom he had brought from Sydney--the Rev. John  Butler and his wife, Francis Hall, a schoolmaster, and James Kemp, a  smith.    New plans were at once formed for an extension of the work. An offer  from Hongi of a site opposite to his own _pa_ was accepted, and Marsden  bought for four dozen axes a large piece of ground on the Kerikeri  River, at the extreme north-west of the Bay. Here, in a sheltered vale  and amid the sound of waterfalls, the new mission station was  established. To it the fresh workers were assigned, Butler taking the  chief place. Marsden himself pushed on across the island to the mouth of  the Hokianga, and on his return was surprised to see much of the new  ground broken up, maize growing upon it, and vines in leaf.    Agriculture formed indeed an important feature in Marsden's plans for  the mission. Seeing Hongi's blind wife working hard in a potato field,  he was much affected by the miserable condition of many of the Maoris:  \"Their temporal situation must be improved by agriculture and the simple  arts, in order to lay a permanent foundation for the introduction of  Christianity.\" No spiritual results were as yet visible, but the chiefs  attended Marsden's services and \"behaved with great decorum.\" On the  evening of September 5 he administered the Holy Communion to the  settlers at Rangihoua. The service was held in a \"shed,\" but \"the  solemnity of the occasion did not fail to excite in our breasts  sensations and feelings corresponding with the peculiar situation in  which we were. We had retrospect to the period when this holy ordinance  was first instituted in Jerusalem in the presence of our Lord's  disciples, and adverted to the peculiar circumstances under which it was  now administered at the very ends of the earth.\"    In spite of the more promising appearances, however, Marsden seems to  have realised that the missionaries must never be left so long again  unvisited. In little more than three months he was again in New Zealand.  There had been no difficulty about leave of absence this time, for the  Admiralty needed kauri timber, and was glad to avail itself of his  influence with the Maoris, and his knowledge of their ways. Marsden made  the most of this unlooked for opportunity, and stayed nine months in the  country. Of all his visits this was the longest and the most full of  arduous effort, but its results were almost nullified by subsequent  events. For it happened that on his arrival at Te Puna he found another  enterprise in contemplation--one which would leave its mark upon  history, and make the year memorable with an evil memory in the annals  of New Zealand. This was the journey of Kendall and Hongi to England.  To understand the course of events and to appreciate its fell  significance, it is necessary to keep in mind both what the Englishman  was doing in New Zealand, and what the New Zealander was doing in  England, during those same months of the year 1820. They will meet again  next year in the parsonage of Parramatta, and then the results of their  separate courses will begin to show themselves.    Hongi, though less definitely favourable to the mission than had been  his nephew Ruatara, had hitherto always stood its friend. On Marsden's  last visit he had indeed disbanded a large army at his request, and had  seemed ready to relinquish his design of obtaining _utu_ for the blood  of several Ngapuhi chiefs who had been lately slain in battle. But the  obtaining of _utu_ was almost the main object of the heathen Maori. An  eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, blood for blood and death for  death--this was his creed. If the blood of the murderer could not be  had, then someone else's blood must be shed--someone, too, of equal rank  and dignity. Hongi could not bring himself to accept the new message of  peace, and his dissatisfaction was, it would seem, fanned by Kendall,  who had ambitions of his own to serve. The other settlers, fearing to  lose the protection of Hongi's restraining hand, did their utmost to  dissuade him from taking the journey, but in vain. \"I shall die,\" said  the chief, \"if I do not go.\"    Four days accordingly after Marsden's arrival the two set sail, having  with them Waikato, another chief of the same tribe. The story of their  visit to England is to a large extent familiar. They were received with  great interest at the Missionary House, but the authorities treated  Hongi as a heathen soul to be saved, and this was not what he wanted.  Together they went to Cambridge, and here Kendall found scope for his  abilities in furnishing to Professor Lee the materials for a scientific  orthography of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#8)"],[1,"directed expressly to  them, and always connected with provisions for the government of  slaves, and not with those for the government of free white citizens.  And after such an uniform course of legislation as we have stated, by  the colonies, by the States, and by Congress, running through a period  of more than a century, it would seem that to call persons thus marked  and stigmatized, \"citizens\" of the United States, \"fellow-citizens,\" a  constituent part of the sovereignty, would be an abuse of terms, and  not calculated to exalt the character of an American citizen in the  eyes of other nations.    The conduct of the Executive Department of the Government has been in  perfect harmony upon this subject with this course of legislation. The  question was brought officially before the late William Wirt, when he  was the Attorney General of the United States, in 1821, and he decided  that the words \"citizens of the United States\" were used in the acts  of Congress in the same sense as in the Constitution; and that free  persons of color were not citizens, within the meaning of the  Constitution and laws; and this opinion has been confirmed by that of  the late Attorney General, Caleb Cushing, in a recent case, and acted  upon by the Secretary of State, who refused to grant passports to them  as \"citizens of the United States.\"    But it is said that a person may be a citizen, and entitled to that  character, although he does not possess all the rights which may  belong to other citizens; as, for example, the right to vote, or to  hold particular offices; and that yet, when he goes into another  State, he is entitled to be recognised there as a citizen, although  the State may measure his rights by the rights which it allows to  persons of a like character or class resident in the State, and refuse  to him the full rights of citizenship.    This argument overlooks the language of the provision in the  Constitution of which we are speaking.    Undoubtedly, a person may be a citizen, that is, a member of the  community who form the sovereignty, although he exercises no share of  the political power, and is incapacitated from holding particular  offices. Women and minors, who form a part of the political family,  cannot vote; and when a property qualification is required to vote or  hold a particular office, those who have not the necessary  qualification cannot vote or hold the office, yet they are citizens.    So, too, a person may be entitled to vote by the law of the State, who  is not a citizen even of the State itself. And in some of the States  of the Union foreigners not naturalized are allowed to vote. And the  State may give the right to free negroes and mulattoes, but that does  not make them citizens of the State, and still less of the United  States. And the provision in the Constitution giving privileges and  immunities in other States, does not apply to them.    Neither does it apply to a person who, being the citizen of a State,  migrates to another State. For then he becomes subject to the laws of  the State in which he lives, and he is no longer a citizen of the  State from which he removed. And the State in which he resides may  then, unquestionably, determine his _status_ or condition, and place  him among the class of persons who are not recognised as citizens, but  belong to an inferior and subject race; and may deny him the  privileges and immunities enjoyed by its citizens.    But so far as mere rights of person are concerned, the provision in  question is confined to citizens of a State who are temporarily in  another State without taking up their residence there. It gives them  no political rights in the State, as to voting or holding office, or  in any other respect. For a citizen of one State has no right to  participate in the government of another. But if he ranks as a citizen  in the State to which he belongs, within the meaning of the  Constitution of the United States, then, whenever he goes into another  State, the Constitution clothes him, as to the rights of person, with  all the privileges and immunities which belong to citizens of the  State. And if persons of the African race are citizens of a State, and  of the United States, they would be entitled to all of these  privileges and immunities in every State, and the State could not  restrict them; for they would hold these privileges and immunities  under the paramount authority of the Federal Government, and its  courts would be bound to maintain and enforce them, the Constitution  and laws of the State to the contrary notwithstanding. And if the  States could limit or restrict them, or place the party in an inferior  grade, this clause of the Constitution would be unmeaning, and could  have no operation; and would give no rights to the citizen when in  another State. He would have none but what the State itself chose to  allow him. This is evidently not the construction or meaning of the  clause in question. It guaranties rights to the citizen, and the State  cannot withhold them. And these rights are of a character and would  lead to consequences which make it absolutely certain that the African  race were not included under the name of citizens of a State, and were  not in the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when these  privileges and immunities were provided for the protection of the  citizen in other States.    The case of Legrand _v._ Darnall (2 Peters, 664) has been referred to  for the purpose of showing that this court has decided that the  descendant of a slave may sue as a citizen in a court of the United  States; but the case itself shows that the question did not arise and  could not have arisen in the case.    It appears from the report, that Darnall was born in Maryland, and was  the son of a white man by one of his slaves, and his father executed  certain instruments to manumit him, and devised to him some landed  property in the State. This property Darnall afterwards sold to  Legrand, the appellant, who gave his notes for the purchase-money. But  becoming afterwards apprehensive that the appellee had not been  emancipated according to the laws of Maryland, he refused to pay the  notes until he could be better satisfied as to Darnall's right to  convey. Darnall, in the mean time, had taken up his residence in  Pennsylvania, and brought suit on the notes, and recovered judgment in  the Circuit Court for the district of Maryland.    The whole proceeding, as appears by the report, was an amicable one;  Legrand being perfectly willing to pay the money, if he could obtain a  title, and Darnall not wishing him to pay unless he could make him a  good one. In point of fact, the whole proceeding was under the  direction of the counsel who argued the case for the appellee, who was  the mutual friend of the parties, and confided in by both of them, and  whose only object was to have the rights of both parties established  by judicial decision in the most speedy and least expensive manner.    Legrand, therefore, raised no objection to the jurisdiction of the  court in the suit at law, because he was himself anxious to obtain the  judgment of the court upon his title. Consequently, there was nothing  in the record before the court to show that Darnall was of African  descent, and the usual judgment and award of execution was entered.  And Legrand thereupon filed his bill on the equity side of the Circuit  Court, stating that Darnall was born a slave, and had not been legally  emancipated, and could not therefore take the land devised to him, nor  make Legrand a good title; and praying an injunction to restrain  Darnall from proceeding to execution on the judgment, which was  granted. Darnall answered, averring in his answer that he was a free  man, and capable of conveying a good title. Testimony was taken on  this point, and at the hearing the Circuit Court was of opinion that  Darnall was a free man and his title good, and dissolved the  injunction and dismissed the bill; and that decree was affirmed here,  upon the appeal of Legrand.    Now, it is difficult to imagine how any question about the citizenship  of Darnall, or his right to sue in that character, can be supposed to  have arisen or been decided in that case. The fact that he was of  African descent was first brought before the court upon the bill in  equity. The suit at law had then passed into judgment and award of  execution, and the Circuit Court, as a court of law, had no longer any  authority over it. It was a valid and legal judgment, which the court  that rendered it had not the power to reverse or set aside. And unless  it had jurisdiction as a court of equity to restrain him from using  its process as a court of law, Darnall, if he thought proper, would  have been at liberty to proceed on his judgment, and compel the  payment of the money, although the allegations in the bill were true,  and he was incapable of making a title. No other court could have  enjoined him, for certainly no State equity court could interfere in  that way with the judgment of a Circuit Court of the United States.    But the Circuit Court as a court of equity certainly had equity  jurisdiction over its own judgment as a court of law, without regard  to the character of the parties; and had not only the right, but it  was its duty--no matter who were the parties in the judgment--to  prevent them from proceeding to enforce it by execution, if the court  was satisfied that the money was not justly and equitably due. The  ability of Darnall to convey did not depend upon his citizenship, but  upon his title to freedom. And if he was free, he could hold and  convey property, by the laws of Maryland, although he was not a  citizen. But if he was by law still a slave, he could not. It was  therefore the duty of the court, sitting as a court of equity in the  latter case, to prevent him from using its process, as a court of  common law, to compel the"]]]
