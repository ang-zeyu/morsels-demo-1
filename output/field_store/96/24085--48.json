The Master, Captain F. Chrimes, was a Lancashire man, of rather striking  personality and appearance. Some writer, who had travelled on the ship  as a passenger, has already portrayed him in one of his published books.  Captain Chrimes admired the men and, although in his official and daily  inspections he assumed an air almost of indifference to what he saw, he  was really closely observant and suggested much--and did more--to make  the conditions of life on board less uncomfortable. In quiet hours he  chatted deferentially with the Brigadier, played chess with the doctors,  or gently \"pulled the legs\" of the young officers. Of stories, he had a  fund. These ranged from stirring personal experiences with lions in the  East African jungles to a pathetic incident connected with the death of  his family's favourite cat. As a mark of affection, the corpse of this  cat was buried in the garden at the foot of an old grape vine. In the  first subsequent crop of fruit--so the Captain related--each grape  appeared with a slight coat of fur!    On the whole the voyage was pleasant enough and almost without unusual  incident, bar an accident or two to individuals. Perfect good feeling  existed amongst the different units during the whole of the journey.  Many friendships were made, and these early associations proved of great  value later on during the stress of work in the field. For the first few  days out wireless communication was kept up with the S.S.  \"Geelong.\" The equator was crossed on about the twelfth day but, at the  expressed wish of the Brigadier, King Neptune held no court.    Early on the 24th June the African coast, just south of Ras-Jard-Hafun,  was sighted. Near here was observed the first ship seen since leaving  Australia. A few dhows were visible close in shore, and in the bay  sharks and rays could be discerned in motion. For a few hours attention  was centred on this first glimpse of a foreign land. \"The doctor has  left off vaccinating us to go and admire the scenery,\" said one man in a  letter home. The foreshore, cliffs, and mountains of Somaliland were  searched with glasses for signs of habitations. So desolate, however,  appeared the country, and so few the signs of life, that, as a  diversion, the men cheered whenever an occasional school of porpoises or  a solitary albatross came more closely under view. Cape Guardafui was  passed soon after lunch, and the following evening the ship stopped her  engines for half an hour in order to exchange messages with Aden, which  was dimly visible through the thick bluish haze of stifling heat.    The 26th June witnessed the entrance to the Red Sea. The Master for the  previous few days had seemed apprehensive in regard to possible enemy  action. Consequently certain additional sentries had been posted and the  machine guns mounted in positions that would give them effective arcs of  fire. From now on the African coast was hugged, but little scenery was  evident after passing Perim Island. Away to the north-east a momentary  glimpse was obtained of Jebel Musa (Mt. Sinai). About this time the  Southern Cross disappeared below the horizon.    The destination of the transport was still unknown, notwithstanding that  gossip had mentioned Suez, Port Said, Alexandria, and even England.  Nevertheless, preparations had to be made either for disembarkation at  the first-named port or for the passage through the Canal. These were  put in hand at once. About this time arose the first crop of rumours, or  \"furphies,\" which ever afterwards seemed to be an inseparable feature of  military life. Perhaps one of the most extraordinary was to the effect  that news had come on board of great anxiety existing in Western  Australia over a supposed disaster to the ship and its living freight.  As no such news _had_ come on board the source of the rumour could not  be traced. Subsequently, in letters received from the homeland, it was  ascertained that such a rumour was actually current there coincident  with its first being mentioned on the transport. Possibly its origin may  be remotely connected with the fact that, simultaneously with the  arrival of the \"Ascanius\" in the Gulf of Suez, a sister ship struck a  mine at the entrance to the Bitter Lakes and had to be beached. The hull  was visible to passengers on the Suez-Cairo railway.    [Illustration: TWO VERY YOUNG SOLDIERS.  Signaller H. H. Holmes.          -          Bugler A. J. Shipway.  Killed in action in France, August, 1916.]    On the evening of June 29th the lights of Suez came into view. Shortly  before midnight the transport dropped anchor some distance from the  town. Next morning a rather unattractive panorama was unveiled to  view. On the west were the bare heights of Jebel Attaka; to the north  Suez lay with its rambling and squalid-looking houses; to the north-east  was Port Tewfik, and beyond that--running down east and south-east--were  the desert sands of Sinai. The waters of the Gulf were calm, but every  revolution of the screws stirred up filth and polluted the air. Some  distance away lay another ship obviously also carrying troops. Greetings  were exchanged at long range. Eventually it was learned that the  transport was the \"Ballarat\" with a load of invalids for Australia.  Amongst them evidently dwelt a pessimist, for in reply to the new  arrivals' stentorian and unanimous \"NO!\" to the question \"Are we  downhearted?\" a disconsolate voice sounded across the water, \"Well, you  ---- soon will be.\"    As rather exaggerated accounts had been received in Australia as to the  dangers of communicating with the native inhabitants of Egypt, special  precautions were taken to prevent bumboat men from coming on board or  too closely approaching the sides. Two boats' crews patrolled round  about and sentries armed with loaded rifles stood at the tops of the  gangways. This resulted in an amusing incident when a dhow, manned by a  very fat Arab fisherman and a small native boy, came too close to the  troopship. No heed being taken of signals to keep further away, the  sentry on duty was instructed to fire a rifle shot across the bow of the  small craft. This proved most effective, and everyone roared with  laughter when the stout fisherman hastily dived below the gunwale out of  sight and forced the terrified small boy to take the helm and steer away  out of danger. In spite of this, however, preliminary bargaining went on  with other boats' crews and first impressions were gained of the ways  and manners of the gentle Egyptian. All that day the ship lay at anchor  and little communication took place with the shore. Nevertheless it was  learned from the port authorities, that as soon as another ship, then at  the wharf, had cleared, the troops were to disembark and journey by  train to a camp near Cairo. In preparation a small advance party of  three officers and 40 other ranks was put ashore with instructions to  proceed to the named area in order to get the camp in readiness for the  troops.    At 7 a.m. on the 2nd July the \"Ascanius\" moved in and berthed. Here the  voices of Egypt were heard in concert. A motley crowd of natives was  grouped about--evidently watched and herded by dapper little policemen,  armed with canes which they seemed to delight in using with or without  provocation. In one place a small gang of labourers, to the music of its  own voices, was building a ramp. In another, seemingly fierce argument  was going on as to the moving of a heavy gangway into position. Still  more men and boys were gazing up at the ship and calling loudly for  \"bakshish.\" \"Bakshish\" was forthcoming first of all in the shape of  copper coins, later on in scraps of food, and again in raw potatoes. All  these were wildly scrambled for, and even the party operating the  gangway forsook duty in the pursuit of gain. The aim with the potatoes  became rather accurate, and after the head serang had been temporarily  incapacitated by a direct hit in the region of the belt, the fusilade  had to be stopped in order that the work of disembarkation might  proceed.    Getting the troops off the ship was a matter of comparative ease, but  the landing of sick, issue of rations, handing over of ship's stores,  and the unloading of horses, wagons, and over 1,250,000 rounds of  ammunition, entailed much organisation and a great deal of hard labour.  Notwithstanding this, the O.C. Troops was able to leave the ship before  5 p.m., having left behind a small party to finally adjust matters with  the ship and disembarkation authorities. This rear party rejoined the  unit three days later.    As the Battalion commenced to disembark the transport \"Geelong\" came to  anchor off the town.          CHAPTER III.    FIRST STAY IN EGYPT.      Four trains, running at intervals of two hours, were used to convey the  troops from the ship's side to the neighbourhood of Cairo. For part of  the journey the railway ran parallel with and in sight of the Canal.  Near Ismailia it turned west and led across the northern part of the  Arabian Desert (once the Land of Goshen) to Zagazig, where it took  another turn, to the south-west, and entered the capital. Though almost  entirely desert, the country was not without interest to the new  arrivals. Sand was not unknown in Western Australia, but had never been  seen over such tremendous tracts and giving off such colours which,  probably due to atmospheric influences, had very distinctive beauty.  Here and there the oases, and the irrigation areas, were marked by palm  trees or by crops of a vivid green hue. There was also seen much that at  once directed attention to the fact that the land was one famed in  biblical history. The costumes of the natives; the flat-roofed  mud-coloured dwellings; the old fashioned wells, the hooded and veiled  women bearing pitchers on their heads, the humble donkey,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#8)"],[1," the reign of Claudius; in which the illustrious  departed was no other than a crow, so celebrated for its talents and  address, that it was looked upon as a sort of public property. Its death  was felt as a national loss; the man who killed it was condemned to  expiate the crime with his own life; and nothing less than a public  funeral could, as it was thought, do justice to its memory. The remains  of the bird were laid on a bier, which was borne by two slaves;  musicians went before it, playing mournful airs; and a great crowd of  people of all ages and conditions, brought up the rear of the melancholy  procession.    [Illustration]          LV    MONKEY VERSUS SNAKE      The monkeys in India, knowing by instinct how dangerous snakes are, are  most vigilant in their destruction. They seize them by the neck, when  asleep, and running to the nearest flat stone, grind down their heads by  a strong friction on the surface, often looking at them, and grinning at  their progress. When sure that the poisonous fangs are destroyed, they  toss the reptiles to their young ones to play with, and seem to be  greatly pleased at the death of their enemies.    [Illustration]          LVI    FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH      A dog, between the breed of a mastiff and a bulldog, belonging to a  chimney sweeper, lay, according to his master's orders, on a soot bag,  which he had placed, carelessly, almost in the middle of a narrow back  street, in a town in the south of England. A loaded cart passing by, the  driver told the dog to move out of the way. When he refused to move, he  was scolded, then beaten, first gently, and afterward pretty hard with  the cart whip. But it was all to no purpose; the dog still lay quietly  on the bag. The driver, with an oath, threatened to drive over the  dog--he did so, and the faithful animal, in trying to stop the wheel by  biting it, was crushed to pieces.    [Illustration: Faithful unto Death.--Page 112]    [Illustration]          LVII    MUSICAL SEALS      Seals have a very delicate sense of hearing, and are much delighted with  music. A gentleman, in his account of a voyage to Spitzenbergen, tells  us that the son of the ship's captain who was very fond of playing on  the violin, never failed to have a large audience when in the seas  frequented by these animals; and he has seen them follow the ship for  miles when any person was playing on deck.          LVIII    A STRANGE FOSTER MOTHER      On an estate in Scotland a terrier had a litter of pups, which were at  once taken away from her and drowned. The unfortunate mother was very  unhappy, until, a few weeks later, she saw a brood of ducklings, which  she seized and carried to her house, where she kept them, following them  in and out with the greatest care, and nursing them after her own  fashion, with the most affectionate anxiety. When the ducklings,  following their natural instinct, went into the water, their  foster-mother was terribly alarmed; and as soon as they came back to  land, she quickly snatched them up in her mouth, and ran home with them.  What is still more strange is, that the same animal, when her litter of  pups were taken away the year before, seized two chicks, which she  brought up with the same care she now bestowed upon the ducks. When the  young cocks began to try their voices, their foster-mother was as much  annoyed as she now was by the swimming of the duckings--and never failed  to repress their attempts at crowing.    [Illustration]          LIX    SONNINI AND HIS CAT      M. Sonnini, when in Egypt, had an Angora cat, of which he was extremely  fond. It was entirely covered with long white silken hairs, and its tail  formed a magnificent plume, which the animal elevated at pleasure over  its body. Not one spot, not a single dark shade marred the dazzling  whiteness of its coat. Its nose and lips were of a delicate rose color.  Two large eyes sparkled in its round head; one was of yellow and the  other of fine blue.    This beautiful animal had even more beauty of manners than grace in  attitude and movements. However ill any one used her, she never tried to  put out her claws from their sheaths. Sensible to kindness, she licked  the hand which caressed, and even the one which tormented her. In  Sonnini's solitary moments, she kept the most of the time close by his  side. She interrupted him often in the midst of his labors or  meditations, by little caresses that were very touching, and she usually  followed him in his walks. During his absence she sought and called for  him all the time. She knew his voice at a distance, and seemed on each  fresh meeting with him to feel increased delight.    \"This animal,\" says Sonnini, \"was my principal amusement for several  years. How plainly was her love for me shown in her face! How many  times have her caresses made me forget my troubles and comforted me in  the midst of my misfortunes! My beautiful and interesting companion,  however, at last died. After several days of suffering, during which I  never left her, the light of her eyes, which were constantly fixed on  me, went out, and her death rent my heart with sorrow.\"    [Illustration]          LX    THE DINNER BELL      It is customary in large boarding-houses to announce the dinner-hour by  sounding a bell. A cat belonging to one of these houses always hastened  to the hall on hearing the bell, to get its usual meal; but it happened  one day that she was shut up at dinner time in a chamber, and it was in  vain for her that the bell had rung. Some hours afterward, having been  released from her confinement, she hastened to the hall, but found  nothing left for her. The clever cat then went to the bell, and ringing  it, tried to call the family to a second dinner, in which she hoped to  get her usual share.    [Illustration]          LXI    FORAGING      A constable once made a complaint before a bench of London magistrates  against a horse for stealing hay. The complainant stated that the horse  came regularly every night of its own accord, and without any attendant,  to the coach stands in St. George's, ate all he wanted, and then  galloped away. He defied the whole of the parish officers to catch him;  for if they tried to go near him while he was eating, he would throw up  his heels and kick at them, or run at them, and if they did not get out  of the way, he would bite them. The constable, therefore, thought it  best to bring the case to the attention of the magistrates.    \"Well, Mr. Constable,\" said one of the magistrates, \"if you should be  annoyed again by this animal in the execution of your duty, you may  arrest him if you can, and bring him before us to answer your  complaints.\"    [Illustration]          LXII    THE TAME SEA GULL      Many years ago a gentleman accidentally caught a sea-gull. He cut its  wings and put it in his garden. The bird remained there for several  years, and being kindly treated, became so tame as to come at call to be  fed at the kitchen door. It was known by the name of Willie. This bird  became at last so tame that no pains were taken to keep it, and, its  wings having grown to full length, it flew away, joined the other gulls  on the beach, and came back from time to time, to pay a visit to the  house. When its companions left the country at the usual season, Willie  went with them, much to the regret of the family. To their great joy,  however, it returned next season; and with its usual familiarity came to  its old haunt, where it was welcomed and fed liberally. In this way it  went and returned for forty years, without missing a year, and kept up  its acquaintance in the most cordial manner; for while in the country,  it visited them almost daily, answered to its name like any domestic  animal, and almost ate out of the hand. One year, however, Willie did  not pay his respects to the family for eight or ten days after the  general flock of gulls were upon the coast, and great was the concern  and sorrow over his loss, as it was thought he must surely be dead; but  to the surprise and joy of the family, a servant one morning came  running into the breakfast-room in great joy, saying that Willie had  returned. Food was soon supplied in abundance, and Willie with his usual  frankness ate of it heartily and was as tame as any barn-yard fowl about  the house. After a year or two more, however, this grateful bird never  came again.    [Illustration]          LXIII    A STRANGE PROTECTOR      A lady had a tame bird which she was in the habit of letting out of its  cage every day. One morning as it was picking crumbs of bread off the  carpet, her cat, who had always showed before great kindness toward the  bird, suddenly seized it, and jumped with it in her mouth upon a table.  The lady was alarmed for the fate of her favorite, but on turning about,  instantly saw the cause. The door had been left open, and a strange cat  had just come into the room! After she had put it out, her own cat came  down from her place of safety, and dropped the bird without having done  it the least injury.    [Illustration]          LXIV    THE LION AND HIS KEEPER      In a large menagerie there was a lion called Danco, whose cage needed  some repairs. His keeper hired a carpenter to do the work, but when the  workman came and saw the lion, he started back in terror. The keeper  entered the animal's cage, and led him to the upper part of it, while  the lower was being fixed. He there amused himself for some time playing  with the lion, and being wearied, at last fell asleep. The carpenter,  relying fully upon the vigilance of the keeper, went on rapidly with his  work, and when he had finished it, he called him to see what was done.  The keeper made no answer. Having repeatedly called him in vain, he  began to feel alarmed at his situation, and he determined to go to the  upper part of the cage, where, looking through the railing, he saw the  lion and the keeper sleeping side by side.
