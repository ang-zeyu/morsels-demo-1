Thus there are two great consequences of the tides in the earth-moon  system--the days are getting longer, the moon is receding further.    These points are so important that I shall try and illustrate them in  another way, which will show, at all events, that one and both of  these tidal phenomena commend themselves to our common sense. Have we  not shown how the tides in their ebb and flow are incessantly  producing friction, and have we not also likened the earth to a great  wheel? When the driver wants to stop a railway train the brakes are  put on, and the brake is merely a contrivance for applying friction to  the circumference of a wheel for the purpose of checking its motion.  Or when a great weight is being lowered by a crane, the motion is  checked by a band which applies friction on the circumference of a  wheel, arranged for the special purpose. Need we then be surprised  that the friction of the tides acts like a brake on the earth, and  gradually tends to check its mighty rotation? The progress of  lengthening the day by the tides is thus readily intelligible. It is  not quite so easy to see why the ebbing and the flowing of the tide on  the earth should actually have the effect of making the moon to  retreat; this phenomenon is in deference to a profound law of nature,  which tells us that action and reaction are equal and opposite to each  other. If I might venture on a very homely illustration, I may say  that the moon, like a troublesome fellow, is constantly annoying the  earth by dragging its waters backward and forward by means of tides;  and the earth, to free itself from this irritating interference, tries  to push off the aggressor and to make him move further away.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Another way in which we can illustrate the retreat of the moon as the  inevitable consequence of tidal friction is shown in the adjoining  figure, in which the large body E represents the earth, and the small  body M the moon. We may for simplicity regard the moon as a point, and  as this attracts each particle of the earth, the total effect of the  moon on the earth may be represented by a single force. By the law of  equality of action and reaction, the force of the earth on the moon is  to be represented by an equal and opposite force. If there were no  tides then the moon's force would of course pass through the earth's  centre; but as the effect of the moon is to slacken the earth's  rotation, it follows that the total force does not exactly pass  through the line of the earth's centre, but a little to one side, in  order to pull the opposite way to that in which the earth is turning,  and thus bring down its speed. We may therefore decompose the earth's  total force on the moon into two parts, one of which tends directly  towards the earth's centre, while the other acts tangentially to the  moon's orbit. The central force is of course the main guiding power  which keeps the moon in its path; but the incessant tangential force  constantly tends to send the moon out further and further, and thus  the growth of its orbit can be accounted for.    We therefore conclude finally, that the tides are making the day  longer and sending the moon away further. It is the development of the  consequences of these laws that specially demands our attention in  these lectures. We must have the courage to look at the facts  unflinchingly, and deduce from them all the wondrous consequences they  involve. Their potency arises from a characteristic feature--they are  unintermitting. Most of the great astronomical changes with which we  are ordinarily familiar are really periodic: they gradually increase  in one direction for years, for centuries, or for untold ages; but  then a change comes, and the increase is changed into a decrease, so  that after the lapse of becoming periods the original state of things  is restored. Such periodic phenomena abound in astronomy. There is the  annual fluctuation of the seasons; there is the eighteen or nineteen  year period of the moon; there is the great period of the precession  of the equinoxes, amounting to twenty-six thousand years; and then  there is the stupendous Annus Magnus of hundreds of thousands of  years, during which the earth's orbit itself breathes in and out in  response to the attraction of the planets. But these periodic  phenomena, however important they may be to us mere creatures of a  day, are insignificant in their effects on the grand evolution through  which the celestial bodies are passing. The really potent agents in  fashioning the universe are those which, however slow or feeble they  may seem to be, are still incessant in their action. The effect which  a cause shall be competent to produce depends not alone upon the  intensity of that cause, but also upon the time during which it has  been in operation. From the phenomena of geology, as well as from  those of astronomy, we know that this earth and the system to which it  belongs has endured for ages, not to be counted by scores of thousands  of years, or, as Prof. Tyndall has so well remarked, \"Not for six  thousand years, nor for sixty thousand years, nor six hundred thousand  years, but for aeons of untold millions.\" Those slender agents which  have devoted themselves unceasingly to the accomplishment of a single  task may in this long lapse of time have accomplished results of  stupendous magnitude. In famed stalactite caverns we are shown a  colossal figure of crystal extending from floor to roof, and the  formation of that column is accounted for when we see a tiny drop  falling from the roof above to the floor beneath. A lifetime may not  suffice for that falling drop to add an appreciable increase to the  stalactite down which it trickles, or to the growing stalagmite on  which it falls; but when the operation has been in progress for  immense ages, it is capable of the formation of the stately column.  Here we have an illustration of an influence which, though apparently  trivial, acquires colossal significance when adequate time is  afforded. It is phenomena of this kind which the student of nature  should most narrowly watch, for they are the real architects of the  universe.    The tidal consequences which we have already demonstrated are  emphatically of this non-periodic class--the day is always  lengthening, the moon is always retreating. To-day is longer than  yesterday; to-morrow will be longer than to-day. It cannot be said  that the change is a great one; it is indeed too small to be  appreciable even by our most delicate observations. In one thousand  years the alteration in the length of a day is only a small fraction  of a second; but what may be a very small matter in one thousand years  can become a very large one in many millions of years. Thus it is that  when we stretch our view through immense vistas of time past, or when  we look forward through immeasurable ages of time to come, the  alteration in the length of the day will assume the most startling  proportions, and involve the most momentous consequences.    Let us first look back. There was a time when the day, instead of  being the twenty-four hours we now have, must have been only  twenty-three hours, How many millions of years ago that was I do not  pretend to say, nor is the point material for our argument; suffice it  to say, that assuming, as geology assures us we may assume, the  existence of these aeons of millions of years, there was once a time  when the day was not only one hour shorter, but was even several hours  less than it is at present. Nor need we stop our retrospect at a day  of even twenty, or fifteen, or ten hours long; we shall at once  project our glance back to an immeasurably remote epoch, at which the  earth was spinning round in a time only one sixth or even less of the  length of the present day. There is here a reason for our retrospect  to halt, for at some eventful period, when the day was about three or  four hours long, the earth must have been in a condition of a very  critical kind.    It is well known that fearful accidents occasionally happen where  large grindstones are being driven at a high speed. The velocity of  rotation becomes too great for the tenacity of the stone to withstand  the stress; a rupture takes place, the stone flies in pieces, and huge  fragments are hurled around. For each particular grindstone there is  a certain special velocity depending upon its actual materials and  character, at which it would inevitably fly in pieces. I have once  before likened our earth to a wheel; now let me liken it to a  grindstone. There is therefore a certain critical velocity of rotation  for the earth at which it would be on the brink of rupture. We cannot  exactly say, in our ignorance of the internal constitution of the  earth, what length of day would be the shortest possible for our earth  to have consistently with the preservation of its integrity; we may,  however, assume that it will be about three or four hours, or perhaps  a little less than three. The exact amount, however, is not really  very material to us; it would be sufficient for our argument to assert  that there is a certain minimum length of day for which the earth can  hold together. In our retrospect, therefore, through the abyss of time  past our view must be bounded by that state of the earth when it is  revolving in this critical period. With what happened before that we  shall not at present concern ourselves. Thus we look back to a time at  the beginning of the present order of things, when the day was only  some three or four hours long.    Let us now look at the moon, and examine where it must have been  during these past ages.

This is the cause of the robbery which he has committed upon you.\" The  stranger acknowledged the truth of the tradesman's statement, delivered up  the coin, and departed.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LIV.    Musical Seals.      Seals have a very delicate sense of hearing, and are much delighted with  music. A gentleman, in his account of a voyage to Spitzbergen, mentions  that the captain of the ship's son, who was fond of playing on the violin,  never failed to have a numerous auditory when in the seas frequented by  these animals; and he has seen them follow the ship for miles when any  person was playing on deck.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LV.    A Sly Couple.      A gentleman in the county of Stirling kept a greyhound and a pointer, and  being fond of coursing, the pointer was accustomed to find the hares, and  the greyhound to catch them. When the season was over, it was found that  the dogs were in the habit of going out by themselves, and killing hares  for their own amusement. To prevent this, a large iron ring was fastened  to the pointer's neck by a leather collar, and hung down so as to prevent  the dog from running, or jumping over dykes, &c. The animals, however,  continued to stroll out to the fields together; and one day the gentleman,  suspecting that all was not right, resolved to watch them, and to his  surprise, found that the moment when they thought that they were  unobserved, the greyhound took up the iron ring in his mouth, and carrying  it, they set off to the hills, and began to search for hares as usual.  They were followed, and it was observed, that whenever the pointer scented  the hare, the ring was dropped, and the greyhound stood ready to pounce  upon poor puss the moment the other drove her from her form, but that he  uniformly returned to assist his companion after he had caught his prey.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LVI.    A Sense of Ridicule.      Persons who have the management of elephants have often observed that they  know very well when any one is ridiculing them, and that they very often  revenge themselves when they have an opportunity. A painter wished to draw  an elephant in the menagerie at Paris in an extraordinary attitude, which  was with his trunk lifted up, and his mouth open. An attendant on the  painter, to make the elephant preserve the position, threw fruits in his  mouth, and often pretended to throw them without doing so. The animal  became irritated, and as if knowing that the painter was to blame rather  than his servant, turned to him, and dashed a quantity of water from his  trunk over the paper on which the painter was sketching his distorted  portrait.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LVII.    The Tame Sea-gull.      Many years ago a gentleman had accidentally caught a sea-gull, whose wings  he cut, and put it into his garden. The bird remained in that situation  for several years, and being kindly treated, became so familiar as to come  at call to be fed at the kitchen door. It was known by the name of Willie.  This bird became at last so tame that no pains were taken to preserve it,  and its wings having grown to full length it flew away, joined the other  gulls on the beach, and came back, from time to time, to pay a visit to  the house. When its companions left the country at the usual season,  Willie accompanied them, much to the regret of the family. To their great  joy, however, it returned next season; and with its usual familiarity came  to its old haunt, where it was welcomed and fed very liberally. In this  way it went and returned for _forty years_, without intermission, and kept  up its acquaintance in the most cordial manner; for while in the country  it visited them almost daily, answered to its name like any domestic  animal, and ate almost out of the hand. One year, however, very near the  period of its final disappearance, Willie did not pay his respects to the  family for eight or ten days after the general flock of gulls were upon  the coast, and great was the lamentation for his loss, as it was feared he  was dead; but to the surprise and joy of the family, a servant one morning  came running into the breakfast-room in ecstasy, announcing that Willie  had returned. The whole company rose from the table to welcome Willie.  Food was soon supplied in abundance, and Willie with his usual frankness  ate of it heartily, and was as tame as any barn-yard fowl about the house.  In a year or two afterwards this grateful bird discontinued his visits for  ever.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LVIII.    Maternal Affection.      Whilst a ship on a voyage of discovery to the North Pole was locked in the  ice, one morning the man at the masthead reported that three bears were  making their way towards the ship. They had, no doubt, been invited by the  scent of some blubber of a sea-horse which the crew was burning on the ice  at the time of their approach. They proved to be a she bear and her two  cubs; but the cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to  the fire, and drew out part of the flesh that remained unconsumed, and ate  it voraciously. The crew threw great lumps of the flesh which they had  still left upon the ice, which the old bear fetched away singly, laying  every lump before the cubs as she brought it, and dividing it, gave each a  share, reserving but a small portion to herself. As she was fetching away  the last piece, they shot both the cubs dead, and wounded the dam, but not  mortally. It would have drawn tears of pity from any but the most  unfeeling to have marked the affectionate concern of this poor animal in  the dying moments of her expiring young. Though sorely wounded, she  crawled to the place where they lay, carrying a lump of flesh she had just  fetched away, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them; when she  saw that they refused to eat, she laid her paws first upon one, then upon  the other, and endeavoured to raise them up, making at the same time the  most pitiable moans. Finding she could not stir them, she went off, and  when she had got at some distance, looked back and moaned; and that not  availing to entice them away, she returned, and smelling round them, began  to lick their wounds. She went off a second time, and having crawled a few  paces, looked again behind her, and for some time stood moaning. But her  cubs not rising to follow her, she returned, and with signs of  inexpressible fondness went round them, pawing them successively. Finding  at last that they were cold and lifeless, she raised her head towards the  ship, and growled a curse upon the destroyers, which they returned with a  volley of musket-balls. She fell between her cubs, and died licking their  wounds.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LIX.    The Pig Pointer.      A sow, which was a thin, long-legged animal (one of the ugliest of the New  Forest breed), when very young conceived so great a partiality to some  pointer puppies that a gamekeeper upon a neighbouring estate was breaking,  that it played, and often came to feed with them. From this circumstance  it occurred to the gamekeeper that, having broken many a dog as obstinate  as a pig, he would try if he could not also succeed in breaking a pig. The  little animal would often go out with the puppies to some distance from  home; and he enticed it farther by a sort of pudding made of barley-meal,  which he carried in one of his pockets. The other he filled with stones,  which he threw at the pig whenever she misbehaved, as he was not able to  catch and correct her in the same manner he did his dogs. He found the  animal tractable, and soon taught her what he wished by this mode of  reward and punishment. They were frequently seen out together, when the  sow quartered her ground as regularly as any pointer, stood when she came  on game (having an excellent nose), and backed other dogs as well as he  ever saw a pointer. When she came on the cold scent of game, she slackened  her trot, and gradually dropped her ears and tail, till she was certain,  and then fell down on her knees. So staunch was she, that she would  frequently remain five minutes and upwards on her point. As soon as the  game rose, she always returned to her master, grunting very loudly for her  reward of pudding if it was not immediately given to her.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LX.    Infant Fascination.      A little girl about three years of age was observed for a number of days  to go to a considerable distance from the house with a piece of bread  which she obtained from her mother. The circumstance attracted the  attention of the mother, who desired her husband to follow the child, and  observe what she did with it. On coming to the child, he found her engaged  in feeding several snakes, called yellow heads, a species of rattlesnake.  He immediately took her away and proceeded to the house for his gun, and  returning, killed two of them at one shot, and another a few days after.  The child called these reptiles in the manner of calling chickens; and  when her father observed, if she continued the practice they would bite  her, the child replied, \"No, father, they won't bite me; they only eat the  bread I give them.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXI.
