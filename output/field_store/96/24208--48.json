The SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE is a thin, membranous layer, which covers  the cartilages, and is thence bent back, or reflected upon the inner  surfaces of the ligaments which surround and enter into the  composition of the joints. This membrane forms a closed sac, like the  membrane that lines an egg-shell.    [Illustration: Fig. 23. The anterior ligaments of the knee-joint. 1, The  tendon of the muscle that extends the leg. 2, The patella. 3, The  anterior ligament of the patella, near its insertion. 4, 4, The synovial  membrane. 5, The internal lateral ligament. 6, The long external lateral  ligament. 7, The anterior and superior ligament that unites the fibula to  the tibia.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24. 2, 3, The ligaments that extend from the clavicle  (1) to the scapula (4.) The ligaments 5, 6, extend from the scapula to  the first bone of the arm.]    116. Beside the synovial membrane, there are numerous smaller sacs,  called _bur'sae mu-co'sae_. These are often associated with the  articulation. In structure, they are analogous to synovial membranes,  and secrete a similar fluid.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    115. Describe the synovial membrane. 116. Describe the bursae mucosae.  What is represented by fig. 23? By fig. 24?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    117. The LIGAMENTS are composed of numerous straight fibres, collected  together, and arranged into short bands of various breadths, or so  interwoven as to form a broad layer, which completely surrounds the  articular extremities of the bones, and constitutes a capsular  ligament. These connecting bands are white, glistening, and inelastic.  Most of the ligaments are found exterior to the synovial membrane.    118. The bones, cartilages, ligaments, and synovial membrane are  insensible when in health; yet they are supplied with organic nerves,  as well as with arteries, veins, and lymphatics.    _Observation._ The joints of the domestic animals are similar in their  construction to those of man. To illustrate this part of the body, a  fresh joint of the calf or sheep may be used. After divesting the  joints of the skin, the satin-like bands, or ligaments, will be seen  passing from one bone to the other, under which may be observed the  membranous bag, called the capsular ligament. This is very smooth, as  it is lined with the soft synovial membrane, beneath which will be  seen the cartilage, that may be cut with a knife, and under this the  rough extremity of the ends of the bones.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    117. Of what are ligaments composed? What is the appearance of these  bands? Where are they found? 118. With what vessels are the cartilages  and ligaments supplied? How can the structure of the joints be  explained?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER VI.    PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES.      119. The bones are the framework of the system. By their solidity and  form, they not only retain every part of the fabric in its proper  shape, but afford a firm surface for the attachment of the muscles and  ligaments. By means of the bones, the human frame presents to the eye  a wonderful piece of mechanism, uniting the most finished symmetry of  form with freedom of motion, and also giving security to many  important organs.    120. To give a clear idea of the relative uses of the bones and  muscles, we will quote the comparison of another, though, as in other  comparisons, there are points of difference. The \"bones are to the  body what the masts and spars are to the ship,--they give support and  the power of resistance. The muscles are to the bones what the ropes  are to the masts and spars. The bones are the levers of the system; by  the action of the muscles their relative positions are changed. As the  masts and spars of a vessel must be sufficiently firm to sustain the  action of the ropes, so the bones must possess the same quality to  sustain the action of the muscles in the human body.\"    121. Some of the bones are designed exclusively for the protection of  the organs which they enclose. Of this number are those that form the  skull, the sockets of the eye, and the cavity of the nose. Others, in  addition to the protection they give to important organs, are useful  in movements of certain kinds. Of this class are the bones of the  spinal column, and ribs. Others are subservient to motion. Of this  class are the upper and lower extremities.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    119-128. _Give the physiology of the bones._ 119. How may the bones be  considered? 120. To what may the bones be compared? 121. Give the  different offices of the bones.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    122. The bones are subject to growth and decay; to removal of old,  useless matter, and the deposit of new particles, as in other tissues.  This has been tested by the following experiment. Some of the inferior  animals were fed with food that contained madder. In a few days, some  of the animals were killed, and their bones exhibited an unusually  reddish appearance. The remainder of the animals were, for a few  weeks, fed on food that contained no coloring principle. When they  were killed, their bones exhibited the usual color of such animals.  The coloring matter, which had been deposited, had been removed by the  action of the lymphatics.    123. The extremities of the bones that concur in forming a joint,  correspond by having their respective configurations reciprocal. They  are, in general, the one convex, and the other concave. In texture  they are porous, and consequently more elastic than if more compact.  These are covered with a cushion of cartilage. The elastic character  of these parts acts as so many springs, in diminishing the jar which  important organs of the system would otherwise receive.    124. The synovial membrane secretes a viscous fluid, which is called  _syn-o'vi-a_. This lubricating fluid of the joints enables the  surfaces of the bones and tendons to move smoothly upon each other,  thus diminishing the friction consequent on their action.    _Observations._ 1st. In this secretion is manifested the skill and  omnipotence of the Great Architect; for no machine of human invention  supplies to itself, by its own operations, the necessary lubricating  fluid. But, in the animal frame, it is supplied in proper quantities,  and applied in the proper place, and at the proper time.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    122. What is said of the change in bones? How was it proved that there  was a constant change in the osseous fabric? 123. What is said of the  extremities of the bones that form a joint? 124. What is synovia? Its  use? What is said of this lubricating fluid?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    2d. In some cases of injury and disease, the synovial fluid is  secreted in large quantities, and distends the sac of the joint. This  affection is called dropsy of the joint, and occurs most frequently in  that of the knee.    125. The function of the ligaments is to connect and bind together the  bones of the system. By them the small bones of the wrist and foot, as  well as the large bones, are as securely fastened as if retained by  clasps of steel. Some of them are situated within the joints, like a  central cord, or pivot, (3, fig. 26.) Some surround it like a hood,  and contain the lubricating synovial fluid, (8, 9, fig. 25,) and some  in the form of bands at the side, (5, 6, fig. 23.)    [Illustration: Fig. 25. 8, 9, The ligaments that extend from the hip-bone  (6) to the femur, (5.)]    [Illustration: Fig. 26. 2, The socket of the hip-joint. 5, The head of  the femur, which is lodged in the socket. 3, The ligament within the  socket.]    126. By the ligaments the lower jaw is bound to the temporal bones,  and the head to the neck. They extend the whole length of the spinal  column, in powerful bands, on the outer surface, between the spinal  bones, and from one spinous process to another. They bind the ribs to  the vertebrae, to the transverse process behind, and to the sternum in  front; and this to the clavicle; and this to the first rib and  scapula; and this last to the humerus.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What is the effect when the synovial fluid is secreted in large  quantities? 125. What is the function of the ligaments? 126. Mention  how the bones of the system are connected.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    127. They also bind the two bones of the fore-arm at the elbow-joint;  and these to the wrist; and these to each other and to those of the  hand; and these last to each other and to those of the fingers and  thumb. In the same manner, they bind the bones of the pelvis together;  and these to the femur; and this to the two bones of the leg and  patella; and so on, to the ankle, foot, and toes, as in the upper  extremities.    [Illustration: Fig. 27. 1, A front view of the lateral ligaments of the  finger-joints. 2, A view of the anterior ligaments (_a_, _b_,) of the  finger-joints. 3, A side view of the lateral ligaments of the finger  joints.]    128. The different joints vary in range of movement, and in complexity  of structure. Some permit motions in all directions, as the shoulder;  some move in two directions, permitting only flexion and extension of  the part, as the elbow; while others have no movement, as the bones of  the head in the adult.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Explain fig. 27. 128.

But suddenly the Maid left weeping, and said in a changed voice: \"Friend,  whereas thou speakest of delivering me, it is more like that I shall  deliver thee.  And now I pray thy pardon for thus grieving thee with my  grief, and that more especially because thou mayst not solace thy grief  with kisses and caresses; but so it was, that for once I was smitten by  the thought of the anguish of this land, and the joy of all the world  besides.\"    Therewith she caught her breath in a half-sob, but refrained her and went  on: \"Now dear friend and darling, take good heed to all that I shall say  to thee, whereas thou must do after the teaching of my words.  And first,  I deem by the monster having met thee at the gates of the land, and  refreshed thee, that the Mistress hath looked for thy coming; nay, by thy  coming hither at all, that she hath cast her net and caught thee.  Hast  thou noted aught that might seem to make this more like?\"    Said Walter: \"Three times in full daylight have I seen go past me the  images of the monster and thee and a glorious lady, even as if ye were  alive.\"    And therewith he told her in few words how it had gone with him since  that day on the quay at Langton.    She said: \"Then it is no longer perhaps, but certain, that thou art her  latest catch; and even so I deemed from the first: and, dear friend, this  is why I have not suffered thee to kiss or caress me, so sore as I longed  for thee.  For the Mistress will have thee for her only, and hath lured  thee hither for nought else; and she is wise in wizardry (even as some  deal am I), and wert thou to touch me with hand or mouth on my naked  flesh, yea, or were it even my raiment, then would she scent the savour  of thy love upon me, and then, though it may be she would spare thee, she  would not spare me.\"    Then was she silent a little, and seemed very downcast, and Walter held  his peace from grief and confusion and helplessness; for of wizardry he  knew nought.    At last the Maid spake again, and said: \"Nevertheless we will not die  redeless.  Now thou must look to this, that from henceforward it is thee,  and not the King's Son, whom she desireth, and that so much the more that  she hath not set eyes on thee.  Remember this, whatsoever her seeming may  be to thee.  Now, therefore, shall the King's Son be free, though he know  it not, to cast his love on whomso he will; and, in a way, I also shall  be free to yeasay him.  Though, forsooth, so fulfilled is she with malice  and spite, that even then she may turn round on me to punish me for doing  that which she would have me do.  Now let me think of it.\"    Then was she silent a good while, and spoke at last: \"Yea, all things are  perilous, and a perilous rede I have thought of, whereof I will not tell  thee as yet; so waste not the short while by asking me.  At least the  worst will be no worse than what shall come if we strive not against it.  And now, my friend, amongst perils it is growing more and more perilous  that we twain should be longer together.  But I would say one thing yet;  and maybe another thereafter.  Thou hast cast thy love upon one who will  be true to thee, whatsoever may befall; yet is she a guileful creature,  and might not help it her life long, and now for thy very sake must needs  be more guileful now than ever before.  And as for me, the guileful, my  love have I cast upon a lovely man, and one true and simple, and a stout-  heart; but at such a pinch is he, that if he withstand all temptation,  his withstanding may belike undo both him and me.  Therefore swear we  both of us, that by both of us shall all guile and all falling away be  forgiven on the day when we shall be free to love each the other as our  hearts will.\"    Walter cried out: \"O love, I swear it indeed! thou art my Hallow, and I  will swear it as on the relics of a Hallow; on thy hands and thy feet I  swear it.\"    The words seemed to her a dear caress; and she laughed, and blushed, and  looked full kindly on him; and then her face grew solemn, and she said:  \"On thy life I swear it!\"    Then she said: \"Now is there nought for thee to do but to go hence  straight to the Golden House, which is my Mistress's house, and the only  house in this land (save one which I may not see), and lieth southward no  long way.  How she will deal with thee, I wot not; but all I have said of  her and thee and the King's Son is true.  Therefore I say to thee, be  wary and cold at heart, whatsoever outward semblance thou mayst make.  If  thou have to yield thee to her, then yield rather late than early, so as  to gain time.  Yet not so late as to seem shamed in yielding for fear's  sake.  Hold fast to thy life, my friend, for in warding that, thou  wardest me from grief without remedy.  Thou wilt see me ere long; it may  be to-morrow, it may be some days hence.  But forget not, that what I may  do, that I am doing.  Take heed also that thou pay no more heed to me, or  rather less, than if thou wert meeting a maiden of no account in the  streets of thine own town.  O my love! barren is this first farewell, as  was our first meeting; but surely shall there be another meeting better  than the first, and the last farewell may be long and long yet.\"    Therewith she stood up, and he knelt before her a little while without  any word, and then arose and went his ways; but when he had gone a space  he turned about, and saw her still standing in the same place; she stayed  a moment when she saw him turn, and then herself turned about.    So he departed through the fair land, and his heart was full with hope  and fear as he went.          CHAPTER XI: WALTER HAPPENETH ON THE MISTRESS      It was but a little after noon when Walter left the Maid behind: he  steered south by the sun, as the Maid had bidden him, and went swiftly;  for, as a good knight wending to battle, the time seemed long to him till  he should meet the foe.    So an hour before sunset he saw something white and gay gleaming through  the boles of the oak-trees, and presently there was clear before him a  most goodly house builded of white marble, carved all about with knots  and imagery, and the carven folk were all painted of their lively  colours, whether it were their raiment or their flesh, and the housings  wherein they stood all done with gold and fair hues.  Gay were the  windows of the house; and there was a pillared porch before the great  door, with images betwixt the pillars both of men and beasts: and when  Walter looked up to the roof of the house, he saw that it gleamed and  shone; for all the tiles were of yellow metal, which he deemed to be of  very gold.    All this he saw as he went, and tarried not to gaze upon it; for he said,  Belike there will be time for me to look on all this before I die.  But  he said also, that, though the house was not of the greatest, it was  beyond compare of all houses of the world.    Now he entered it by the porch, and came into a hall many-pillared, and  vaulted over, the walls painted with gold and ultramarine, the floor  dark, and spangled with many colours, and the windows glazed with knots  and pictures.  Midmost thereof was a fountain of gold, whence the water  ran two ways in gold-lined runnels, spanned twice with little bridges of  silver.  Long was that hall, and now not very light, so that Walter was  come past the fountain before he saw any folk therein: then he looked up  toward the high-seat, and himseemed that a great light shone thence, and  dazzled his eyes; and he went on a little way, and then fell on his  knees; for there before him on the high-seat sat that wondrous Lady,  whose lively image had been shown to him thrice before; and she was clad  in gold and jewels, as he had erst seen her.  But now she was not alone;  for by her side sat a young man, goodly enough, so far as Walter might  see him, and most richly clad, with a jewelled sword by his side, and a  chaplet of gems on his head.  They held each other by the hand, and  seemed to be in dear converse together; but they spake softly, so that  Walter might not hear what they said, till at last the man spake aloud to  the Lady: \"Seest thou not that there is a man in the hall?\"    \"Yea,\" she said, \"I see him yonder, kneeling on his knees; let him come  nigher and give some account of himself.\"    So Walter stood up and drew nigh, and stood there, all shamefaced and  confused, looking on those twain, and wondering at the beauty of the  Lady.  As for the man, who was slim, and black-haired, and  straight-featured, for all his goodliness Walter accounted him little,  and nowise deemed him to look chieftain-like.    Now the Lady spake not to Walter any more than erst; but at last the man  said: \"Why doest thou not kneel as thou didst erewhile?\"    Walter was on the point of giving him back a fierce answer; but the Lady  spake and said: \"Nay, friend, it matters not whether he kneel or stand;  but he may say, if he will, what he would have of me, and wherefore he is  come hither.\"    Then spake Walter, for as wroth and ashamed as he was: \"Lady, I have  strayed into this land, and have come to thine house as I suppose, and if  I be not welcome, I may well depart straightway, and seek a way out of  thy land, if thou wouldst drive me thence, as well as out of thine  house.\"    Thereat the Lady turned and looked on him, and when her eyes met his, he  felt a pang of fear and desire mingled shoot through his heart.  This  time she spoke to him; but coldly, without either wrath or any thought of  him: \"Newcomer,\" she said, \"I have not bidden thee hither; but here mayst  thou abide a while if thou wilt; nevertheless, take heed that here is no  King's Court.  There is, forsooth, a folk that serveth me (or, it may be,  more than one),"]]]
