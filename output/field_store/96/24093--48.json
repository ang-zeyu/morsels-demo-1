And look which class among the audience is the       more numerous.         Just. Well now, I'm looking.         Unj. What, then, do you see?         Just. By the gods, the blackguards to be far more       numerous. This fellow, at any rate, I know; and him       yonder; and this fellow with the long hair.         Unj. What, then, will you say?         Just. We are conquered. Ye blackguards, by the gods,       receive my cloak, for I desert to you.         [Exeunt the Two Causes, and re-enter Socrates and       Strepsiades.]         Soc. What then? whether do you wish to take and lead       away this your son, or shall I teach him to speak?         Strep. Teach him, and chastise him: and remember that       you train him properly; on the one side able for petty       suits; but train his other jaw able for the more       important causes.         Soc. Make yourself easy; you shall receive him back a       clever sophist.         Strep. Nay, rather, pale and wretched.         [Exeunt Socrates, Strepsiades, and Phidippides.]         Cho. Go ye, then: but I think that you will repent of       these proceedings. We wish to speak about the judges,       what they will gain, if at all they justly assist this       Chorus. For in the first place, if you wish to plough up       your fields in spring, we will rain for you first; but       for the others afterward. And then we will protect the       fruits, and the vines, so that neither drought afflict       them, nor excessive wet weather. But if any mortal       dishonour us who are goddesses, let him consider what       evils he will suffer at our hands, obtaining neither       wine nor anything else from his farm. For when his       olives and vines sprout, they shall be cut down; with       such slings will we smite them. And if we see him making       brick, we will rain; and we will smash the tiles of his       roof with round hailstones. And if he himself, or any       one of his kindred or friends, at any time marry, we       will rain the whole night; so he will probably wish       rather to have been even in Egypt than to have judged       badly.         [Enter Strepsiades with a meal-sack on his shoulder.]         Strep.

For every one to whom I happen to be       indebted, swears, and says he will ruin and destroy me,       having made his deposits against me; though I only ask       what is moderate and just-\"My good sir, one part don't       take just now; the other part put off I pray; and the       other part remit\"; they say that thus they will never       get back their money, but abuse me, as I am unjust, and       say they will go to law with me. Now therefore let them       go to law, for it little concerns me, if Phidippides has       learned to speak well. I shall soon know by knocking at       the thinking-shop.         [Knocks at the door.]         Boy, I say! Boy, boy!         [Enter Socrates]         Soc. Good morning, Strepsiades.         Strep. The same to you. But first accept this present;       for one ought to compliment the teacher with a fee. And       tell me about my son, if he has learned that cause,       which you just now brought forward.         Soc. He has learned it.         Strep. Well done, O Fraud, all-powerful queen!         Soc. So that you can get clear off from whatever suit       you please.         Strep. Even if witnesses were present when I borrowed       the money?         Soc. Yea, much more! Even if a thousand be present.         Strep. Then I will shout with a very loud shout: Ho!       Weep, you petty-usurers, both you and your principals,       and your compound interests! For you can no longer do me       any harm, because such a son is being reared for me in       this house, shining with a double-edged tongue, for my       guardian, the preserver of my house, a mischief to my       enemies, ending the sadness of the great woes of his       father. Him do thou run and summon from within to me.         [Socrates goes into the house.]         O child! O son! Come forth from the house! Hear your       father!         [Re-enter Socrates leading in Phidippides]         Soc. Lo, here is the man!         Strep. O my dear, my dear!         Soc. Take your son and depart.         [Exit Socrates.]         Strep. Oh, oh, my child! Huzza! Huzza! How I am       delighted at the first sight of your complexion! Now,       indeed, you are, in the first place, negative and       disputatious to look at, and this fashion native to the       place plainly appears, the \"what do you say?\" and the       seeming to be injured when, I well know, you are       injuring and inflicting a wrong; and in your countenance       there is the Attic look. Now, therefore, see that you       save me, since you have also ruined me.         Phid. What, pray, do you fear?         Strep. The Old and New.         Phid. Why, is any day old and new?         Strep. Yes; on which they say that they will make their       deposits against me.         Phid. Then those that have made them will lose them; for       it is not possible that two days can be one day.         Strep. Can not it?         Phid. Certainly not; unless the same woman can be both       old and young at the same time.         Strep. And yet it is the law.         Phid. For they do not, I think, rightly understand what       the law means.         Strep. And what does it mean?         Phid. The ancient Solon  was by nature the commons'       friend.         Strep. This surely is nothing whatever to the Old and       New.         Phid. He therefore made the summons for two days, for       the Old and New, that the deposits might be made on the       first of the month.         Strep. Why, pray, did he add the old day?         Phid. In order, my good sir, that the defendants, being       present a day before, might compromise the matter of       their own accord; but if not, that they might be worried       on the morning of the new moon.         Strep. Why, then, do the magistrates not receive the       deposits on the new moon, but on the Old and New?         Phid. They seem to me to do what the forestallers do: in       order that they may appreciate the deposits as soon as       possible, on this account they have the first pick by       one day.         Strep. (turning to the audience) Bravo! Ye wretches, why       do you sit senseless, the gain of us wise men, being       blocks, ciphers, mere sheep, jars heaped together,       wherefore I must sing an encomium upon myself and this       my son, on account of our good fortune. \"O happy       Strepsiades! How wise you are yourself, and how       excellent is the son whom you are rearing!\" My friends       and fellow-tribesmen will say of me, envying me, when       you prove victorious in arguing causes. But first I wish       to lead you in and entertain you.         [Exeunt Strepsiades and Phidippides.]         Pasias (entering with his summons-witness) Then, ought a       man to throw away any part of his own property? Never!       But it were better then at once to put away blushes,       rather than now to have trouble; since I am now dragging       you to be a witness, for the sake of my own money; and       further, in addition to this, I shall become an enemy to       my fellow-tribesman. But never, while I live, will I       disgrace my country, but will summon Strepsiades.         Strep. (from within) Who's there?         Pas. For the Old and New.         Strep. I call you to witness, that he has named it for       two days. For what matter do you summon me?         Pas. For the twelve minae, which you received when you       were buying the dapple-gray horse.         Strep. A horse? Do you not hear? I, whom you all know to       hate horsemanship!         Pas. And, by Jupiter! You swore by the gods too, that       you would repay it.         Strep. Ay, by Jove! For then my Phidippides did not yet       know the irrefragable argument.         Pas. And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the       debt?         Strep. Why, what good should I get else from his       instruction?         Pas. And will you be willing to deny these upon oath of       the gods?         Strep. What gods?         Pas. Jupiter, Mercury, and Neptune.         Strep. Yes, by Jupiter! And would pay down, too, a       three-obol piece besides to swear.         Pas. Then may you perish some day for your impudence!         Strep. This man would be the better for it if he were       cleansed by rubbing with salt.         Pas. Ah me, how you deride me!         Strep. He will contain six choae.          Pas. By great Jupiter and the gods, you certainly shall       not do this to me with impunity!         Strep. I like your gods amazingly; and Jupiter, sworn       by, is ridiculous to the knowing ones.          Pas. You will assuredly suffer punishment, some time or       other, for this. But answer and dismiss me, whether you       are going to repay me my money or not.         Strep. Keep quiet now, for I will presently answer you       distinctly.         [Runs into the house.]         Pas. (to his summons-witness). What do you think he will       do?         Witness. I think he will pay you.         [Re-enter Strepsiades with a kneading-trough]         Strep. Where is this man who asks me for his money? Tell       me what is this?         Pas. What is this? A kardopos.         Strep. And do you then ask me for your money, being such       an ignorant person? I would not pay, not even an obolus,       to any one who called the kardope kardopos.         Pas. Then won't you pay me?         Strep. Not, as far as I know. Will you not then pack off       as fast as possible from my door?

That evening was passed  _tete-a-tete_ with comte Jean; he thought, as I did, that the foundation  of our treasure was firm as a rock, and he gave me many counsels for the  future which I promised to observe; for indeed it was to my own interest  to do so. Upon how many follies did we then debate, which, but a few  days afterwards we found practicable. The different ministers passed in  review before us; some we determined upon retaining, whilst others were  dismissed, and already I began in idea to act with sovereign power over  these illustrious personages, amongst whom I anticipated shortly playing  so important a part. \"After all,\" said I, \"the world is but an amusing  theatre, and I see no reason why a pretty woman should not play a  principal part in it.\"        CHAPTER III           The king's message--Letter from the countess--A second       supper at Versailles--The duc d'Ayen--A short account of M.       de Fleury--The duc de Duras--Conversation with the king--The       next day--A visit from the duc de Richelieu--Visit from the       duc de la Vauguyon--Visit from comte Jean--Visit from the       king--A third supper--Favor    Early the following day I received a message from the king, accompanied  with a bouquet of flowers tied round with a string of diamonds. A short  letter was annexed to this splendid gift, which I would transcribe here,  had it not been taken from me with many others. My reply, which I wrote  upon the spur of the moment, was concise, and, as I preserved the rough  copy, under the impression of its being one day useful, I can give the  reader the exact words.    \"The billet traced by your noble hands, renders me the happiest of  women. My joy is beyond description. Thanks, monsieur le Baron, for your  charming flowers. Alas! they will be faded and withered by to-morrow,  but not so fleeting and short-lived are the sentiments with which you  have inspired me. Believe me, the desire you express to see me again  is entirely mutual; and in the impatience with which you await our next  interview, I read but my own sentiments. The ardor with which you long  to embrace me, is fully equalled by the affection which leads me to  desire no gratification greater than that of passing my whole life in  your society. Adieu, monsieur le baron; you have forbidden my addressing  you as your rank and my respect would have me, I will therefore content  myself with assuring you of the ardent affection of the    \"COMTESSE Du Barry.\"    The signature I adopted was a bold piece of falsehood, but it was too  late to recede; besides, I was addressing myself in my letter, not to  the king, but to the baron de Gonesse; for Louis, by I know not what  unaccountable caprice, seemed to wish to preserve his incognito. I have  since learned that Francis I assumed the same name, altho' upon a very  different occasion. Replying to a letter from Charles V, in which that  emperor had given himself a long string of high sounding titles, he  contented himself with simply signing his letter, \"_Francois, baron de  Gonesse._\" Louis XV was very fond of borrowed appellations. Unlike the  vanity so common to mankind, of seeking to set off their pretensions  by assumed titles, it is the pleasure of royalty to descend to a lower  grade in society when concealment becomes desirable, either from policy  or pleasure; and Louis sought in the familiarity in which a plain baron  might safely indulge, a relief from the ennui attendant upon the rigid  etiquette of a regal state. I had omitted in my letter to the baron,  to remind him that we were to meet that very evening, but that did not  prevent my repairing to Versailles punctually at the appointed hour. I  was conducted into the same apartment as before, where I found the same  females who had then assisted at my toilette again prepared to lend  their aid; and from this moment I had a regular establishment of  attendants appointed for my use.    The moment the king was informed of my arrival, unable to restrain his  impatience, he hastened to me to assist at my dressing table, and he  continued standing beside me so long as the operation lasted; I felt  greatly embarrassed, not knowing whether I durst take the liberty of  requesting him to be seated. However, my silence on the subject was  greatly admired, and ascribed to my perfect acquaintance with polished  life, when in reality it originated from mere timidity. My triumph was  complete; the monarch smiled at and admired every word as it fell from  my lips, kissed my hands, and played with the curls of my long hair,  sportively twisting his fingers amidst my flowing ringlets with all  the vivacity of a lover of twenty. The company upon this evening was  different from that of the former occasion, consisting of the duc de  Duras, first gentleman of the bedchamber, and the duc d'Ayen, who had  the reputation of being a great wit; however, in my opinion, he was  much more deserving the character of a real fiend; his very breath  was poisonous, and his touch venomous as the bite of an adder. I well  remember what M. de Fleury said of him to the king in my presence.  \"Sire,\" said he, \"the thing I most dread in the world next to a bite  from M. d'Ayen, is the bite of a mad dog.\" For my own part, I did not  in the end look upon him with less terror, and well he paid me for my  fears. Upon one occasion, when the king was speaking of me to him, he  said, \"I am well aware that I succeed St. Foix.\"    \"Yes, sire\"; replied the duke, \"in the same manner as your majesty  succeeds Pharamond!\"    I never forgave him those words, dictated by a fiendish malice. However,  upon the evening of my first introduction to him, he behaved to me with  the most marked politeness. I was then an object of no consequence to  his interests, and his vision had not yet revealed to him the height I  was destined to attain. He looked upon me but as one of those meteors  which sparkled and shone in the castle at Versailles for twenty-four  hours, and sank to rise no more.    The duc de Duras was not an ill-disposed person, but inconceivably  stupid; indeed, wit was by no means a family inheritance. Both father  and son, good sort of people in other respects, were for ever saying or  doing some good thing in support of their reputation for stupidity at  court. One day the king quite jokingly inquired of the duc de Duras,  what was done with the old moons. \"Upon my word, sire,\" replied he,  \"I can give you no idea, never having seen, but with your majesty's  permission, I will endeavor to learn from M. de Cassini*!\" To such a  pitch did the poor man's simplicity extend. Both father and son were  nominated to attend the king of Denmark, when on his road to visit  France. The king observed to a person who repeated it to me: \"The French  are generally styled a clever, witty nation; I cannot say I should ever  have been able to discover it, had I been tempted to form my opinion  from the specimen they have sent me.\"     *The royal astronomer--Gutenberg ed.    As far as I am concerned, after saying so many unfavorable things of the  Messrs. de Duras, I must do them the justice to say, that their conduct  towards me was everything that could be desired. I was always glad to  see them; it gave my own imagination a sort of sedative dose to converse  with these two simple-minded beings, whose interests I was always ready  to promote by every means in my power, and I trust the memory of what I  have done will be long remembered by the noble house of Duras.    This supper did not pass off so gaily as the former one. The duc de  Duras spoke as little as possible, in the dread of making some unlucky  speech, and the duc d'Ayen sat devouring the spleen he could not  give vent to, and meditating fresh objects upon whom to exercise his  malignity; he vainly endeavored to lead me on to make some ridiculous  observation, but without success; happily for him, the king did not  perceive his aim. My royal lover was indeed so entirely engrossed by me,  that he lost all the duke's manoeuvres; his transports appeared too much  for his senses to sustain, and he vowed that I should never quit him  more, but remain to be elevated by his power to the first place at  court. At the monarch's sign, the two guests withdrew.    When the duc d'Ayen quitted the room, \"That nobleman is by no means to  my taste,\" said I to the king, \"he has the air of a spy, who wishes me  no good.\"    \"Do you really think so, my lovely comtesse?\"    \"I am certain of it; and I already shudder at the bare anticipation of  an enemy having access to your majesty's ear.\"    \"Reassure yourself,\" said the king, with the utmost tenderness, \"in me  you have a sure defender, who will never forsake you; look upon me from  this minute as your natural protector, and woe to him on whose head your  displeasure shall fall.\"    After this conversation the king and myself retired to rest, and when he  quitted me in the morning, he entreated me not to return to Paris, but  to give him my company for a whole week. Lebel made his appearance to  beg I would consider myself mistress of the apartments I occupied, and  that he had received orders to provide me with an establishment upon the  most handsome scale.    That very day Henriette, whom I had sent for, and instituted as my head  waiting-woman, informed me, that an old gentleman, attired as tho' for a  grand gala, but who refused to send in his name, begged to be permitted  to pay his respects. I bade her admit him; it was the duc de Richelieu.    \"Madame la comtesse,\" said he, bowing low, \"I come to complain of your  want of condescension; unless, indeed, your memory has been at fault.  Was it possible that when I had the honor of supping with you the other  night, you did not "]]]
