Believe me ever, your sincere friend,                    CAROLINE COLLINS.    _10.--Returning Thanks for the Present._    Louisville, July 6, 1894.    Dear Mrs. Collins:    I am very much obliged to you for the handsome bracelet you have sent me.  How kind and thoughtful it was of you to remember me on my birthday. I am  sure I have every cause to bless the day, and did I forget it, I have many  kind friends to remind me of it. Again thanking you for your present, which  is far too beautiful for me, and also for your kind wishes.              Believe me, your most grateful                    BERTHA SMITH.    _11.--Congratulating a Friend Upon His Marriage._    Menton, N.Y., May 24th, 1894.    My Dear Everett:    I have to-day received the invitation to your wedding, and as I cannot be  present at that happy event to offer my congratulations in person, I write.    I am heartily glad you are going to be married, and congratulate you upon  the wisdom of your choice. You have won a noble as well as a beautiful  woman, and one whose love will make you a happy man to your life's end. May  God grant that trouble may not come near you, but should it be your lot,  you will have a wife to whom you can look with confidence for comfort, and  whose good sense and devotion to you will be your sure and unfailing  support.    That you may both be very happy, and that your happiness may increase with  your years, is the prayer of              Your Friend,                    FRANK HOWARD.    {43}    [Illustration: Declaration of Affection]    Any extravagant flattery should be avoided, both as tending to disgust  those to whom it is addressed, as well as to degrade the writers, and to  create suspicion as to their sincerity. The sentiments should spring from  the tenderness of the heart, and, when faithfully and delicately expressed,  will never be read without exciting sympathy or emotion in all hearts not  absolutely deadened by insensibility.    {44}    [Illustration]    _FORMS OF LOVE LETTERS._    _12.--An Ardent Declaration._.    Naperville, Ill., June 10th, 1894.    My Dearest Laura:    I can no longer restrain myself from writing to you, dearest and best of  girls, what I have often been on the point of saying to you. I love you so  much that I cannot find words in which to express my feelings. I have loved  you from the very first day we met, and always shall. Do you blame me  because I write so freely? I should be unworthy of you if I did not tell  you the whole truth. Oh, Laura, can you love me in return? I am sure I  shall not be able to bear it if your answer is unfavorable. I will study  your every wish if you will give me the right to do so. May I hope? Send  just one kind word to your sincere friend,                  HARRY SMITH.    _13.--A Lover's Good-bye Before Starting on a Journey._    Pearl St., New York, March 11th, 1894.    My Dearest Nellie: I am off to-morrow, and yet not altogether, for I leave  my heart behind in your gentle keeping. You need not place a guard over it,  however, for it is as impossible that it should stay away, as for a bit of  steel {45} to rush from a magnet. The simile is eminently correct, for you,  my dear girl, are a magnet, and my heart is as true to you as steel. I  shall make my absence as brief as possible. Not a day, not an hour, not a  minute, shall I waste either in going or returning. Oh, this business; but  I won't complain, for we must have something for our hive besides  honey--something that rhymes with it--and that we must have it, I must  bestir myself. You will find me a faithful correspondent. Like the spider,  I shall drop a line by (almost) every post; and mind, you must give me  letter for letter. I can't give you credit. Your returns must be prompt and  punctual.              Passionately yours,                    LEWIS SHUMAN.    To Miss Nellie Carter,  No. ---- Fifth Avenue, New York.    _14.--From an Absent Lover._    Chicago, Ill., Sept. 10, 1894.    My Dearest Kate: This sheet of paper, though I should cover it with loving  words, could never tell you truly how I long to see you again. Time does  not run on with me now at the same pace as with other people; the hours  seem days, the days weeks, while I am absent from you, and I have no faith  in the accuracy of clocks and almanacs. Ah! if there were truth in  clairvoyance, wouldn't I be with you at this moment! I wonder if you are as  impatient to see me as I am to fly to you? Sometimes it seems as if I must  leave business and everything else to the Fates, and take the first train  to Dawson. However, the hours do move, though they don't appear to, and in  a few more weeks we shall meet again. Let me hear from you as frequently as  possible in the meantime. Tell me of your health, your amusements and your  affections.    Remember that every word you write will be a comfort to me.              Unchangeably yours,                    WILLIAM MILLER.    To Miss Kate Martin,  Dawson, N. D.    _15.--A Declaration of Love at First Sight_.    Waterford, Maine, May 8th, 1894.    Dear Miss Searles:    Although I have been in your society but once, the impression you have made  upon me is so deep and powerful that I cannot forbear writing to you, in  defiance of all rules of etiquette. Affection is sometimes of slow growth:  {46} but sometimes it springs up in a moment. In half an hour after I was  introduced to you my heart was no longer my own. I have not the assurance  to suppose that I have been fortunate enough to create any interest in  yours; but will you allow me to cultivate your acquaintance in the hope of  being able to win your regard in the course of time? Petitioning for a few  lines in reply,              I remain, dear Miss Searles,                Yours devotedly,                    E. C. NICKS.    Miss E. Searles,  Waterford, Maine.    _16.--Proposing Marriage._    Wednesday, October 20th, 1894.    Dearest Etta:    The delightful hours I have passed in your society have left an impression  on my mind that is altogether indelible, and cannot be effaced even by time  itself. The frequent opportunities I have possessed, of observing the  thousand acts of amiability and kindness which mark the daily tenor of your  life, have ripened my feelings of affectionate regard into a passion at  once ardent and sincere, until I have at length associated my hopes of  future happiness with the idea of you as a life partner, in them. Believe  me, dearest Etta, this is no puerile fancy, but the matured results of a  long and warmly cherished admiration of your many charms of person and  mind. It is love--pure, devoted love, and I feel confident that your  knowledge of my character will lead you to ascribe my motives to their true  source.    May I then implore you to consult your own heart, and should this avowal of  my fervent and honorable passion for you be crowned with your acceptance  and approval, to grant me permission to refer the matter to your parents.  Anxiously awaiting your answer,              I am, dearest Etta,                Your sincere and faithful lover,                    GEO. COURTRIGHT.    To Miss Etta Jay,  Malden, Ill.    {47}    _17.--From a Gentleman to a Widow._    Philadelphia, May 10th, 1894.    My Dear Mrs. Freeman:    I am sure you are too clear-sighted not to have observed the profound  impression which your amiable qualities, intelligence and personal  attractions have made upon my heart, and as you have not repelled my  attentions nor manifested displeasure when I ventured to hint at the deep  interest I felt in your welfare and happiness, I cannot help hoping that  you will receive an explicit expression of my attachments, kindly and  favorably. I wish it were in my power to clothe the feelings I entertain  for you in such words as should make my pleadings irresistible; but, after  all, what could I say, more than you are very dear to me, and that the most  earnest desire of my soul is to have the privilege of calling you my wife?  Do you, can you love me? You will not, I am certain, keep me in suspense,  for you are too good and kind to trifle for a moment with sincerity like  mine. Awaiting your answer,              I remain with respectful affection,                Ever yours,                    HENRY MURRAY.    Mrs. Julia Freeman,  Philadelphia.    _18.--From a Lady to an Inconstant Lover._    Dear Harry:    It is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which has given me  great pain, and upon which silence has become impossible if I would  preserve my self-respect. You cannot but be aware that I have just reason  for saying that you have much displeased me. You have apparently forgotten  what is due to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least. You cannot  suppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by conduct toward  other ladies from which I should naturally have the right to expect you to  abstain. I am not so vulgar a person as to be jealous. When there is cause  to infer changed feelings, or unfaithfulness to promises of constancy,  jealousy is not the remedy. What the remedy is I need not say--we both of  us have it in our hands. I am sure you will agree with me that we must come  to some understanding by which the future shall be governed. Neither you  nor I can bear a divided allegiance. Believe me that I write more in sorrow  than in anger. You have made me very unhappy, and perhaps thoughtlessly.  But it will take much to reassure me of your unaltered regard.              Yours truly,                EMMA.           *       *       *       *       *      {48}    [Illustration: MODESTY.

Indeed, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel! (#8)"],[1,"hand 'fore you spreads your  money out recklesslike,\" Kirby agreed. \"So, if we find the right setup,  we move, but--\"    Drew swung up one hand in the horseman's signal of warning.  \"Something--or someone--_is_ on the move ... ahead there!\" he warned.          4    _The Eleventh Ohio Cavalry_      They had worked their way around the edge of the cornfield, and now they  could look out on a hard-surfaced road which must be the pike. Riding  along that in good order were a company of men--thirty, Drew counted.  And four of those had extra horses on leading reins. He also saw ten  carbines ... and the owners of those were alert.    \"Stand where you are!\" The slight man leading that skeleton troop posted  ahead. His shell jacket had the three yellow bars of a captain on its  standing collar, and Drew saluted. This was the first group of fugitives  he had seen who were more than frightened men running their horses and  themselves into exhaustion.    \"Rennie, Private, Quirk's Scouts,\" Drew reported himself.    Kirby's salute was delivered with less snap but as promptly. \"Kirby,  Private, Gano's.\"    \"Captain William Campbell,\" the officer identified himself crisply. \"Any  more of you?\" He looked to Boyd and then at the cornfield beyond.    \"Barrett's a volunteer,\" Drew explained. This was no time to clarify  Boyd's exact status. \"There're just the three of us.\"    \"You headin' somewheah special, Cap'n?\" the Texan asked. \"Or jus'  travelin' for your continued health?\"    Campbell laughed. \"You might call it that, Kirby. But if we stick  together, I think all of us may stay healthy.\"    Kirby turned his horse into the pike. \"Sounds like a good argument to  me, suh. You have any idea wheah at we are, or wheah we could be  headin'?\"    \"Northwest is the best I can say. If we strike far enough to the west,  we may be able to flank the troops spread out to keep us away from the  river. Best plan for now, anyway. And the more men we can pick up, the  better.\"    \"Scattered some, ain't we?\" Kirby assented. \"You give the orders, Cap'n,  suh. We ain't licked complete yet.\"    There was a low growl arising from the company on the pike as the  Texan's comment reached them. They might have run and gone on running  most of that long day, but they were no longer running; they were moving  in reasonable order and to some purpose, with a direction in view and a  form of organization, no matter how patched together they were. Campbell  spoke directly to Drew: \"You know anything about this section of the  country?\"    \"Some, but it's been almost three years since I was here. I know nothin'  about any Union garrison--\"    \"Those we'll have to worry about as they come. But you ride advance for  us now. Send in any stragglers you come across. The night is almost  here, and that's in our favor.\"    So Drew and Kirby, with Boyd trailing, ranged ahead of the small troop.  And pick up more stragglers they did--some twenty men in the last hour  before twilight closed down.    \"I'm hungry,\" Boyd said, approaching Drew. \"There're farms around. Why  can't we get something to eat?\"    \"Here.\" Drew fumbled in the saddlebags he had transferred from Shawnee  to this new mount back by the river. He handed over a piece of hardtack,  flinty-surfaced and about as appetizing as a stone. \"That's the best  you'll get for a while.\"    Boyd stared at it in dismay. \"You can't eat a thing like this! It's a  piece of rock.\" Indignantly he hurled it away.    \"You get down and pick that up! Now!\"    Boyd, flushed and hot-eyed, gazed at Drew for a long moment. The flush  faded and he moved uneasily in his saddle, but not out of the range of  Drew's attention. At length, unhappily, he dismounted and went to pick  the gray-white chunk out of a weed tangle. Holding it gingerly, he came  back to his horse.    \"If you don't want it--give!\" Drew held out his hand.    Boyd, realizing the other meant just what he said, fingered the hardtack  and finally dropped it into that waiting palm.    \"You eat hard and you sleep on the soft side of a board--if you're lucky  enough to find a board. You ride till your seat is blistered and until  you can sleep in the saddle. You drink mud green with scum if that's all  you can find to drink, and you think it's mighty fine drinkin', too.  This ain't--\" Drew's thoughts flitted back to his meeting with Aunt  Marianna on the Lexington road--\"all saber wavin' and chargin' the enemy  and playin' hero to the home folks; this is sweatin' and dirt on you and  your clothes, goin' mighty hungry, and cold and wet--when it's the  season for goin' cold and wet. It's takin' a lot of the bad, with not  much good. And if you don't cut off home now, you'll ride our way,  keepin' your mouth shut and doin' as you're told!\"    Boyd swallowed visibly. \"All right.\" But there was a firmness in that  short answer which surprised Drew. The other sounded as if he meant it,  as if he were swearing the oath of allegiance to the regiment. But  _could_ he take it? A few days on the run, and Boyd would probably quit.  Maybe if they got into some town and the Yankees didn't smoke them out  right away, Drew could send a telegram and Boyd would be collected. Drew  tried to console himself with that thought all the time another part of  him was certain that Boyd intended to prove he could stick through all  the rigors Drew had just outlined for him.    But in any event the boy's introduction to war was going to be as  unromantic as anyone could want, short of being thrown cold and  untrained into a major battle. They must be prepared for a bad time  until they made it out of the Union lines and south again.    The night closed down, dark and moonless, with a heaviness in the air  which was oppressive. Campbell had to grant men and horses a breathing  period. He put out pickets, leaving the rest of them to lie with their  mounts saddled and to hand. Drew loosened the girth, stripped off saddle  and blanket, and wiped down the sweaty back of his new mount. But he  dared not leave the gelding free. So, against all good practice, he  re-equipped the tired beast. No mount was going to be able to take that  kind of treatment for long. They had a half dozen spare horses, and  undoubtedly they could \"trade\" worn-out mounts for fresh ones along the  way. But such ceaseless use was cruel punishment, and no man wanted to  inflict it. War was harder on horses than men. At least the men could  take their chances and had a fraction of free will in the matter.    Drew awoke at a tug of his sleeve, flailed out his arm, and struck home.  Kirby laughed in the gray dawn.    \"Now that theah, kid, is no way to go 'round wakin' up a soldier. He may  take you for a blue belly as has come crawlin' into his dreams. It's all  right, amigo--jus' time to git on the prowl again.\"    Feeling as if he had been beaten, Drew slowly got to his feet. Men were  moving, falling into line. And one was arguing with Captain Campbell.    \"It could work, Cap'n,\" the trooper urged. \"Ain't a lot of the boys  wearin' Yankee truck they took outta the warehouses? Them what ain't can  act like prisoners. Jus' say we're the Eleventh Ohio--they's stationed  near Bardstown and it would seem right, them ridin' down to take them  some prisoners. The old man, he's got a rich farm and sets a powerful  good table. Might even give us a right smart load of provisions into the  bargain. It's worth a try, suh....\"    \"Rennie!\" So summoned, Drew reported to their new commander.    \"Know anything about a Thomas McKeever livin' in this section?\"    Drew's memory produced a picture of a round-faced, cheerful man who  liked to play chess and admired Lucilla's pickled watermelon rind to the  point of begging a crock of it every time he visited Red Springs.    \"Yes, suh. He's Union--got two sons with Colonel Wolford. Owns a big  farm and raises prime mules--\"    \"You know him personally?\"    \"Yes, suh. He's a friend of my grandfather; they used to visit back and  forth a lot.\"    \"Then he'd know you.\" Campbell's fingernails rasped through the stubble  on his chin.    \"So Rennie heah could be one of our prisoners, suh. That theah might  convince Mistuh McKeever we's what we say--\" the trooper pressed his  point.    \"Could be. It's gospel truth we ain't goin' to get far with our bellies  flat on our backbones. And it might work. Now, all of you men,  listen....\" Campbell explained, gave orders, and put them through a  small drill. A dozen men without any Union uniform loot to distinguish  them were told to play the role of prisoners; the others exchanged and  drew out of saddlebags pieces of blue clothing to make their appearance  as the Eleventh Ohio.    \"They ain't gonna expect too much.\" The trooper who had first urged the  plan was optimistic. \"We can pass as close to militia----\"    \"You hope!\" Kirby was in the prisoner's section, and it was plain he did  not relish a role which meant that he had to strip himself of weapons.  \"You--\" he fixed his attention on the man to whom he must hand his Colts  when the time came--\"keep right 'longside, soldier. If I want to get  those six-guns, I want 'em fast an' I want 'em sure--not 'bout ten yards  away wheah I can't git my hands on 'em!\"    Their gnawing hunger drove them all into agreeing to the masquerade.  Drew could not recall his last really full meal. Just thinking about  food made a warm, sickish taste rise in his mouth. He brought out the  hardtack which Boyd had so indignantly rejected the night before, and  holding the chunk balanced on his saddle horn, rapped it smartly with  the butt of a revolver. It broke raggedly across, and then he was able  to crack it again between his fingers.    \"Here--\" He held out a two-inch piece to Boyd, and this time there was  no refusal. The younger boy's cheek showed a swollen puff as he sucked  away at the fragment.    Drew offered a bite to the Texan.    \"Right neighborly, amigo,\" Kirby observed. \"'Bout this time, me, I'm  ready to exercise "]]]
