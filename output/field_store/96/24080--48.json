This story and song he gave to others, that it might be as a voice of  warning to young and eager warriors, and help them to guard against a  misadventure like his own.    Although the young man in after years became noted in the tribe for  his prudence and valour, this story and song of his youth have  survived the memory of his later deeds.    The words give the pith of the adventure: \"I did not report aright  when I went to the Leader and bade him arise. It was a wolf that was  moving.\"    The spirited music breathes the impatient eagerness of youth. The  haste and insistence of the young warrior are heard in the phrase  where he addresses the \"Nu-don hon-ga,\" or Leader. The song is a great  favourite among the young men of several Indian tribes in our  country.    [Music: MI-KA-THI.

This little song of springtime was noted from the singing of a Tigua  girl of the pueblo of Isleta, N.M., by my honoured and lamented friend  and co-worker, Professor John Comfort Fillmore. It tells the story of  the semi-arid region where it was born.         Rain, people, rain!       The rain is all around us.       It is going to come pouring down,       And the summer will be fair to see,       The mocking-bird has said so.    [Music: MOCKING BIRD SONG.    _Tigua._    Transcribed and harmonized  by PROF.

There are few more pathetic sights than that of an Indian ghost  dance,--pathetic in itself, not to consider the gloomy background of  fear inspired by it in the minds of so many of our own race who have  so widely misunderstood its meaning. The ceremony is but an appeal to  the unseen world to come near and to comfort those who have been  overtaken in the land of their fathers by conditions both strange and  incomprehensible.    The ghost or spirit dance is a modified survival of several ancient  ceremonies, blended into one and touched here and there with ideas  borrowed from our own race.    In the hypnotic vision which follows the monotonous dance, the  landscape of his former days, untouched by the white man, appears to  the \"controlled\" Indian: the streams wander through unbroken prairie;  no roadways, no fields of wheat, intrude upon the broad stretches of  native grasses; the vanished herds of buffalo come back to their  grazing-grounds; the deer and the antelope, the wolf and the bear, are  again in the land; and the eagles look down on the Indian villages,  where are to be seen the faces of old friends returned from the  spirit realm. These are the scenes which come to the homesick Indian,  who is stranded in his native land, his ears filled with foreign  sounds, his old activities gone, and his hands unskilled and unable to  take up new ones.    The ghost dance is the cry of a forsaken people, forsaken by the gods  in which they once trusted,--a people bewildered by the complexity of  the new path they must follow, misunderstood by and misunderstanding  the race with whom they are forced to live. In this brief ceremony of  the ghost dance the Indians seek to close their eyes to an unwelcome  reality, and to live in the fanciful vision of an irrecoverable past.           *       *       *       *       *    This song was given me by a ghost dancer, a leader in the Arapaho  tribe. Before he sang, he explained to me the ceremony, its peaceful  character, and, all unconsciously, made apparent its expression of a  pathetic longing for a life that can never return. Standing before the  graphophone, he offered an earnest prayer, then, with his companions,  sang this song.    The simple pathos of the words cannot be reproduced in English.  They carry a meaning beneath their literal sense that appeals like the  cry of a child.         Father, have pity upon me!       I am weeping from hunger (of the spirit):       There is nothing here to satisfy me!    The music tells the story of the cry. Its cadences are antiphonal, as  between the two worlds.    [Music: GHOST DANCE SONG.    _Arapaho._]          SACRED SONGS OF PEACE.      When the white race first visited the Indians in the Mississippi  valley, they found among them a ceremony common to a large number of  tribes; and it was observed that, whenever the symbolic objects  peculiar to this ceremony were displayed, they were treated with  profound respect.    These sacred objects were two perforated sticks, like pipe stems, one  painted blue to represent the sky, and the other green to typify the  earth; and among their bright-coloured decorations were the plumages  of particular birds and wing-like pendants of eagle feathers. They  symbolised the heavens and the earth and the mysterious power that  permeates all nature. In their presence the Indians were taught that  they should care for their children, think of the future welfare of  the people, put aside personal grievances, repress anger and warlike  emotions, and be like kindred, at peace with one another. Different  names were given to these peculiar objects by the different tribes;  and they were classed by our early travellers with the \"calumets,\" or  pipes of peace, although they were not pipes, for they had no bowl and  could not be smoked.    It was due to the presence of one of these so-called \"calumets\" in  Marquette's frail canoe that made possible his peaceful descent of the  Mississippi River on his voyage of discovery. He writes that the  \"calumet is the most mysterious thing in the world. The sceptres of  our kings are not so much respected; ... for one with this calumet may  venture among his enemies, and in the hottest battles they lay down  their arms before this sacred pipe.\"    The \"calumet\" ceremony has, therefore, an historic interest for us,  apart from its revelation of the religious beliefs and social ideals  of the Indian. To explain the symbolism, the teachings, and the  observances which make up this complex rite would fill a volume; but,  that something of the dignity and beauty of the thoughts expressed in  it may be known, two of its numerous songs are here given.    To understand the significance of these songs, it should be known that  two distinct groups or parties were indispensable to the performance  of the ceremony; namely, they who brought the \"calumets\" and they who  received them. As it was imperative that there should be no blood  relationship between these two parties, they always belonged to  different tribes or to two distinct kinship groups within the tribe.  The party bringing the \"calumets\" was called \"the father,\" while those  receiving them were \"the children.\" These terms refer to the tie about  to be formed between the two unrelated parties by means of this sacred  ceremony. This tie was esteemed more honourable and binding than the  natural bond of father and son.    The ceremony generally took place in a circular dwelling known as an  \"earth lodge.\" The occasion drew together a large concourse of  people,--men, women, and children; and the gay costumes, the glinting  of ornaments, the picturesque groups, and the happy, smiling faces of  old and young made a scene full of colour and motion. Many times I  have witnessed this ceremony and joined in its beautiful chorals, led  by the bearers, who swayed the \"calumets\" to the rhythm of the song,  wafting over the heads of the people the blessing of peace.    The following choral was sung immediately after the \"calumets\" had  been ceremonially taken from their resting-place, with movements that  simulated the eagle rising from its nest. The bearers then faced the  people, seated on the ground against the wall of the lodge, and with  slow rhythmic steps moved around the circle, waving the \"calumets\"  over the heads of the multitude. As the \"calumets\" passed slowly by,  the people took up the choral, until at last the great lodge resounded  with its majestic cadences. The leaping flames from the central fire  lit up the faces of the hundreds of men and women; while the swaying  feathers of the \"calumets\" cast great wing-like shadows on the  glistening roof, and seemed to make real the symbolic presence of the  mighty eagle himself, circling over the people as he sped on his  mission, bearing the benediction of good will among men.    Once, at the close of this song, an old Indian turned to me and said,  \"The 'calumets' are of God.\"    The words of this choral refer to the blessing of peace given to \"the  fathers\" in ancient days, and now brought by the symbolic \"calumets\"  to \"the children.\"         Down through the ages vast,       On wings strong and true,       From great Wa-ko_n_'-da comes       Good will unto you,--       Peace, that shall here remain.

Here the ground had  been specially prepared, and a wildcat skin spread upon it for the  reception of the \"calumets.\" Over this skin, which had its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#8)"],[1," before.  But now it is different.  This is not curiosity.  It is Duty and Love.  Won't you come with me,  Harold?'    Harold leaped from the edge of the ha-ha where he had been sitting and  held up his hand.  She took it and leaped down lightly beside him.    'Come,' he said, 'let us go there now!'  She took his arm when they got  on the path again, and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way they  went together to the piece of garden which she called her own; there they  picked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers.  Then they walked to the  old church.  The door was open and they passed in.  Harold took from his  pocket a tiny key.  This surprised her, and heightened the agitation  which she naturally suffered from revisiting the place.  She said nothing  whilst he opened the door to the crypt.  Within, on a bracket, stood some  candles in glass shades and boxes of matches.  Harold lit three candles,  and leaving one of them on the shelf, and placing his cap beside it, took  the other two in his hands.  Stephen, holding her flowers tightly to her  breast with her right hand, took Harold's arm with the left, and with  beating heart entered the crypt.    For several minutes Harold kept her engaged, telling her about the crypt  in his father's church, and how he went down at his last visit to see the  coffin of his dear father, and how he knelt before it.  Stephen was much  moved, and held tight to his arm, her heart beating.  But in the time she  was getting accustomed to the place.  Her eyes, useless at first on  coming out of the bright sunlight, and not able to distinguish anything,  began to take in the shape of the place and to see the rows of great  coffins that stood out along the far wall.  She also saw with surprise  that the newest coffin, on which for several reasons her eyes rested, was  no longer dusty but was scrupulously clean.  Following with her eyes as  well as she could see into the further corners she saw that there the  same reform had been effected.  Even the walls and ceiling had been swept  of the hanging cobwebs, and the floor was clean with the cleanliness of  ablution.  Still holding Harold's arm, she moved over towards her  mother's coffin and knelt before it.  Harold knelt with her; for a little  while she remained still and silent, praying inwardly.  Then she rose,  and taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on the lid of  the coffin above where she thought her mother's heart would be.  Then she  turned to Harold, her eyes flowing and her cheeks wet with tears, and  laid her head against his breast.  Her arms could not go round his neck  till he had bent his head, for with his great height he simply towered  above her.  Presently she was quiet; the paroxysm of her grief had  passed.  She took Harold's hand in both hers, and together they went to  the door.  With his disengaged hand, for he would not have disturbed the  other for worlds, Harold put out the lights and locked the door behind  them.    In the church she held him away from her, and looked him fairly in the  face.  She said slowly:    'Harold, was it you who had the crypt cleaned?'  He answered in a low  voice:    'I knew you would want to go again!'    She took the great hand which she held between hers, and before he knew  what she was doing and could prevent her, raised it to her lips and  kissed it, saying lovingly:    'Oh, Harold!  No brother in all the wide world could be kinder.  And--and--'  this with a sob, 'we both thank you; mother and I!'          CHAPTER VI--A VISIT TO OXFORD      The next important move in the household was Harold's going to Cambridge.  His father had always intended this, and Squire Norman had borne his  wishes in mind.  Harold joined Trinity, the college which had been his  father's, and took up his residence in due course.    Stephen was now nearly twelve.  Her range of friendships, naturally  limited by her circumstances in life, was enlarged to the full; and if  she had not many close friends there were at least of them all that was  numerically possible.  She still kept up to certain degree the little  gatherings which in her childhood were got together for her amusement,  and in the various games then instituted she still took a part.  She  never lost sight of the fact that her father took a certain pleasure in  her bodily vigour.  And though with her growing years and the conscious  acceptance of her womanhood, she lost sight of the old childish fancy of  being a boy instead of a girl, she could not lose sight of the fact that  strength and alertness are sources of feminine as well as of masculine  power.    Amongst the young friends who came from time to time during his holidays  was Leonard Everard, now a tall, handsome boy.  He was one of those boys  who develop young, and who seem never to have any of that gawky stage so  noticeable in the youth of men made in a large pattern.  He was always  well-poised, trim-set, alert; fleet of foot, and springy all over.  In  games he was _facile princeps_, seeming to make his effort always in the  right way and without exertion, as if by an instinct of physical  masterdom.  His universal success in such matters helped to give him an  easy debonair manner which was in itself winning.  So physically complete  a youth has always a charm.  In its very presence there is a sort of  sympathetic expression, such as comes with the sunshine.    Stephen always in Leonard's presence showed something of the common  attitude.  His youth and beauty and sex all had their influence on her.  The influence of sex, as it is understood with regard to a later period  of life, did not in her case exist; Cupid's darts are barbed and winged  for more adult victims.  But in her case Leonard's masculine superiority,  emphasised by the few years between their age, his sublime self-belief,  and, above all, his absolute disregard for herself or her wishes or her  feelings, put him on a level at which she had to look up to him.  The  first step in the ladder of pre-eminence had been achieved when she  realised that he was not on her level; the second when she experienced  rather than thought that he had more influence on her than she had on  him.  Here again was a little morsel of hero worship, which, though based  on a misconception of fact, was still of influence.  In that episode of  the crypt she had always believed that it was Leonard who had carried her  out and laid her on the church floor in light and safety.  He had been  strong enough and resolute enough to do this, whilst she had fainted!  Harold's generous forbearance had really worked to a false end.    It was not strange, therefore, that she found occasional companionship  with the handsome, wilful, domineering boy somewhat of luxury.  She did  not see him often enough to get tired of him; to find out the weakness of  his character; to realise his deep-seated, remorseless selfishness.  But  after all he was only an episode in a young life which was full of  interests.  Term after term came and went; the holidays had their  seasonable pleasures, occasionally shared in common.  That was all.    Harold's attitude was the same as ever.  He was of a constant nature; and  now that manhood was within hail the love of his boyhood was ripening to  a man's love.  That was all.  He was with regard to Stephen the same  devoted, worshipping protector, without thought of self; without hope of  reward.  Whatever Stephen wished Harold did; and Stephen, knowing their  old wishes and their old pleasures, was content with their renewal.  Each  holiday between the terms became mainly a repetition of the days of the  old life.  They lived in the past.    Amongst the things that did not change was Stephen's riding dress.  The  scarlet habit had never been a thing for everyday wear, but had from the  first been kept for special occasions.  Stephen herself knew that it was  not a conventional costume; but she rather preferred it, if on that  account alone.  In a certain way she felt justified in using it; for a  red habit was a sort of tradition in the family.    It was on one of these occasions that she had gone with Harold into the  churchyard where they had heard the discussion regarding God and the  Angels.    * * * * *    When Stephen was about sixteen she went for a short visit to Oxford.  She  stayed at Somerville with Mrs. Egerton, an old friend of her mother's,  who was a professor at the college.  She sent back her maid who had  travelled with her, as she knew that the college girls did not have  servants of their own.  The visit was prolonged by mutual consent into a  duration of some weeks.  Stephen fell in love with the place and the  life, and had serious thoughts of joining the college herself.  Indeed  she had made up her mind to ask her father to allow her, knowing well  that he would consent to that or to any other wholesome wish of hers.  But  then came the thought that he would be all alone at home; and following  that came another thought, and one of more poignant feeling.  He was  alone now!  Already, for many days, she had left him, for the first time  in her life!  Stephen was quick to act; well she knew that at home there  would be no fault found with her for a speedy return.  Within a few hours  she had brought her visit to an end, and was by herself, despite Mrs.  Egerton's protest, in the train on the way back to Norcester.    In the train she began to review, for the first time, her visit to the  university.  All had been so strange and new and delightful to her that  she had never stopped for retrospect.  Life in the new and enchanting  place had been in the moving present.  The mind had been receptive only,  gathering data for later thought.  During her visit she had had no one to  direct her thought, and so it had been all personal, with the freedom of  individuality at large.  Of course her mother's friend, skilled in the  mind-workings of average girls, and able to pick"]]]
