He is therefore       satisfied with what the _Twice-Told Tales_ have done for him,       and feels it to be far better than fame.\"    That there should be any truth in this statement that the public was so  slow to recognize so fine a genius, is a mortifying evidence of the  worthlessness of a literary popularity. But it may be said of  Hawthorne's fame that it has grown steadily, and that while many who  have received the turbulent applause of the multitude since he began his  career are forgotten, it has widened and brightened, until his name is  among the very highest in his domain of art, to shine there with a  lustre equally serene and enduring.    Mr. Hawthorne's last work is _The House of Seven Gables_, a romance of  the present day. It is not less original, not less striking, not less  powerful, than The Scarlet Letter. We doubt indeed whether he has  elsewhere surpassed either of the three strongly contrasted characters  of the book. An innocent and joyous child-woman, Phoebe Pyncheon,  comes from a farm-house into the grand and gloomy old mansion where her  distant relation, Hepzibah Pyncheon, an aristocratical and fearfully  ugly but kind-hearted unmarried woman of sixty, is just coming down from  her faded state to keep in one of her drawing-rooms a small shop, that  she may be able to maintain an elder brother who is every moment  expected home from a prison to which in his youth he had been condemned  unjustly, and in the silent solitude of which he has kept some  lineaments of gentleness while his hair has grown white, and a sense of  beauty while his brain has become disordered and his heart has been  crushed and all present influences of beauty have been quite shut out.  The House of Seven Gables is the purest piece of imagination in our  prose literature.    The characteristics of Hawthorne which first arrest the attention are  imagination and reflection, and these are exhibited in remarkable power  and activity in tales and essays, of which the style is distinguished  for great simplicity, purity and tranquillity. His beautiful story of  Rappacini's Daughter was originally published in the Democratic Review,  as a translation from the French of one M. de l'Aubepine, a writer whose  very name, he remarks in a brief introduction, (in which he gives in  French the titles of some of his tales, as _Contes deux foix racontees_,  _Le Culte du Feu,_ etc.) \"is unknown to many of his countrymen, as well  as to the student of foreign literature.\" He describes himself, under  this _nomme de plume_, as one who--         \"Seems to occupy an unfortunate position between the       transcendentalists (who under one name or another have their       share in all the current literature of the world), and the       great body of pen-and-ink men who address the intellect and       sympathies of the multitude. If not too refined, at all events       too remote, too shadowy and unsubstantial, in his mode of       development, to suit the taste of the latter class, and yet too       popular to a satisfy the spiritual or metaphysical requisitions       of the former, he must necessarily find himself without an       audience, except here and there an individual, or possibly an       isolated clique.\"    His writings, to do them justice, he says--         \"Are not altogether destitute of fancy and originality; they       might have won him greater reputation but for an inveterate       love of allegory, which is apt to invest his plots and       characters with the aspect of scenery and people in the clouds,       and to steal away the human warmth out of his conceptions. His       fictions are sometimes historical, sometimes of the present       day, and sometimes, so far as can be discovered, have little or       no reference either to time or space. In any case, he generally       contents himself with a very slight embroidery of outward       manners,--the faintest possible counterfeit of real life,--and       endeavors to create an interest by some less obvious       peculiarity of the subject. Occasionally a breath of nature, a       rain-drop of pathos and tenderness, or a gleam of humor, will       find its way into the midst of his fantastic imagery, and make       us feel as if, after all, we were yet within the limits of our       native earth. We will only add to this cursory notice, that M.       de l'Aubepine's productions, if the reader chance to take them       in precisely the proper point of view, may amuse a leisure hour       as well as those of a brighter man; if otherwise, they can       hardly fail to look excessively like nonsense.\"    Hawthorne is as accurately as he is happily described in this curious  piece of criticism, though no one who takes his works in the \"proper  point of view,\" will by any means agree to the modest estimate which, in  the perfect sincerity of his nature, he has placed upon them. He is  original, in invention, construction, and expression, always  picturesque, and sometimes in a high degree dramatic. His favorite  scenes and traditions are those of his own country, many of which he has  made classical by the beautiful associations that he has thrown around  them. Every thing to him is suggestive, as his own pregnant pages are to  the congenial reader. All his productions are life-mysteries,  significant of profound truths. His speculations, often bold and  striking, are presented with singular force, but with such a quiet grace  and simplicity as not to startle until they enter in and occupy the  mind. The gayety with which his pensiveness is occasionally broken,  seems more than any thing else in his works to have cost some effort.  The gentle sadness, the \"half-acknowledged melancholy,\" of his manner  and reflections, are more natural and characteristic.    His style is studded with the most poetical imagery, and marked in every  part with the happiest graces of expression, while it is calm, chaste,  and flowing, and transparent as water. There is a habit among nearly all  the writers of imaginative literature, of adulterating the conversations  of the poor with barbarisms and grammatical blunders which have no more  fidelity than elegance. Hawthorne's integrity as well as his  exquisite--taste prevented him from falling into this error. There is  not in the world a large rural population that speaks its native  language with a purity approaching that with which the English is spoken  by the common people of New England. The vulgar words and phrases which  in other states are supposed to be peculiar to this part of the country  are unknown east of the Hudson, except to the readers of foreign  newspapers, or the listeners to low comedians who find it profitable to  convey such novelties into Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. We  are glad to see a book that is going down to the next ages as a  representative of national manners and character in all respects  correct.    Nathaniel Hawthorne is among the first of the first order of our  writers, and in their peculiar province his works are not excelled in  the literature of the present day or of the English language.          YEAST: A PROBLEM.      The Rev. Mr. KINGSLEY, author of _Alton Locke_, has collected into a  book the series of vehement and yeasty papers which have appeared from  his pen in _Fraser's Magazine_ under the above title, and a new impulse  is thus given in England to the discussion of the Problem of Society.  The declared object of the work--which is of the class of philosophical  novels--is to exhibit the miseries of the poor; the conventionalisms,  hypocrisies, and feebleness of the rich; the religious doubts of the  strong, and the miserable delusions and superstitions of the weak; the  mammon-worship of the middling and upper classes, and the angry humility  of the masses. The story is very slight, but sufficient for the  effective presentation of the author's opinions. The best characters are  an Irish parson, a fox-hunting squire and his commonplace worldly wife,  and a thoughtless and reckless but not unkind man of the world. Here is  a sketch of a commonplace old English vicar, such as has been familiar  in the pages of novels and essays time out of mind:         \"He told me, hearing me quote Schiller, to beware of the       Germans, for they were all Pantheists at heart. I asked him       whether he included Lange and Bunsen, and it appeared that he       had never read a German book in his life. He then flew       furiously at Mr. Carlyle, and I found that all he knew of him       was from a certain review in the _Quarterly_. He called Boehmen       a theosophic Atheist. I should have burst out at that, had I       not read the very words in a High Church review, the day       before, and hoped that he was not aware of the impudent       falsehood which he was retailing. Whenever I feebly interposed       an objection to any thing he said (for, after all he talked       on), he told me to hear the Catholic Church. I asked him which       Catholic Church? He said the English. I asked him whether it       was to be the Church of the sixth century, or the thirteenth,       or the seventeenth, or the eighteenth? He told me the one and       eternal Church, which belonged as much to the nineteenth       century as to the first. I begged to know whether, then, I was       to hear the Church according to Simeon, or according to Newman,       or according to St. Paul; for they seemed to me a little at       variance? He told me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#8)"],[1," seem to  have been undertaken chiefly with a view of rousing patriotic  enthusiasm. French aeroplane scouts had brought in the intelligence that  only small bodies of German troops occupied the left bank of the Rhine.  Therefore the opportunity was presented to invade the upper part of the  lost province of Alsace--a dramatic blow calculated to arouse the French  patriotic spirit. Since the Germans had expended hardly any effort in  its defense, leaving, as it were an open door, it may have been part of  the strategic idea of their General Staff to draw a French army into  that region, with the design of inflicting a crushing defeat. Thus  French resistance in the southern Vosges would have been weakened, the  capture of Belfort, unsupported by its field army, a probability, and a  drive beyond into France by the German forces concentrated at  Neubreisach made triumphant. Doubtless the French General Staff fully  grasped the German intention, but considered a nibble at the alluring  German bait of some value for its sentimental effect upon the French and  Alsatians. Otherwise the invasion of Upper Alsace with a brigade was  doomed at the outset to win no military advantage.    On August 7, 1914, the French dispersed a German outpost intrenched  before Altkirch. Some cavalry skirmishing followed, which resulted in  the French gaining possession of the city. As was to be expected, the  citizens of Altkirch welcomed the French with enthusiasm. The following  morning the French were permitted an uncontested advance to Muelhausen.  That such an important manufacturing center as Muelhausen should have  remained unfortified within striking distance of the French frontier,  that the French entered it without being compelled to fire a shot, was a  surprise to every one with the probable exception of the German and  French General Staffs.    The citizens of Muelhausen repeated the joyous ovation bestowed on the  French troops in Altkirch. The French uniform was hailed as the visible  sign of deliverance from German dominion, and the restoration of the  lost province to their kindred of the neighboring republic. The climax  of this ebullition was reached in a proclamation issued by direction of  General Joffre. \"People of Alsace,\" it ran, \"after forty years of weary  waiting, French soldiers again tread the soil of your native country.  They are the pioneers in the great work of redemption. What emotion and  what pride for them! To complete the work they are ready to sacrifice  their lives. The French nation with one heart spurs them forward, and on  the folds of their flag are inscribed the magical names Liberty and  Right. Long live France! Long live Alsace!\"    During August 8, 1914, some intermittent fighting went on in the  vicinity of Muelhausen, which seems to have given the French general in  command the impression that the Germans were not eager for a  counterattack. In turn the Germans may well have been puzzled that a  French brigade instead of an army was thrown into Upper Alsace for the  bait of Muelhausen. Possibly they waited a little for the main body,  which did not come.    Sunday, August 9, 1914, revealed the Germans in such overpowering  strength, that the French were left no other choice than to beat a  hasty retreat. They accordingly fell back upon Altkirch, to intrench a  few miles beyond their own border. Thus ended the French initial  offensive. In military reckoning it achieved little of value.    Meanwhile in the Ardennes on August 13, 1914, the German Crown Prince,  commanding the Fourth Army, advanced from Luxemburg into the southern  Ardennes and captured Neufchateau. His further objective was to break  through the French line somewhere near the historic ground of Sedan. But  at this point some change in the German plan seems to have taken place.  From the maze enveloping the opening events of the war, one can only  conjecture a reason which would move such an irrevocable body as the  German General Staff to alter a long-fixed plan. Probably, then, the  unanticipated strength of Belgian resistance foreshadowed the summoning  of reenforcements to Von Kluck's right wing of the whole German army. We  have seen, in fact, how he came to be near a desperate need at Bruges,  and only the heavy reenforcement of Von Boehn enabled that general to  deliver a final defeat to the Belgian field army at Weerde. Whatever the  cause of change of plan may have been, important forces attached to or  intended for the armies of the Duke of Wuerttemberg and the crown prince  were withdrawn to support the armies of Von Kluck and Von Buelow. These  forces went to form a unit under General von Hausen, a veteran of  Sadowa. This change left the Saxon army of the crown prince with hardly  sufficient strength for a main attack on the French line at Sedan, but  still formidable enough to feel its way cautiously through the Ardennes  to test the French concentration on the central Meuse's west bank. When  the German right had finally settled Liege, the Saxon army could then  join in the united great movement on Paris.    Early on the morning of August 15, 1914, a French detachment of half an  infantry regiment, thrown into Dinant, was surprised by a mobile Saxon  advance force of cavalry, infantry and artillery. Dinant lies across the  Meuse eighteen miles south of Namur. It is a picturesque ancient town,  the haunt of artists and tourists. In the vicinity are the estates of  several wealthy Belgian families, particularly the thirteenth-century  chateau of Walzin, once the stronghold of the Comtes d'Ardennes. A  bridge crosses the Meuse at Dinant, which sits mainly on the east bank  within shadow of precipitous limestone cliffs. A stone fort more  imposing in appearance than modern effectiveness crowns the highest  cliff summit overlooking Dinant. The Germans came by way of the east  bank to occupy the suburbs. They presently captured the fort and hoisted  the German flag. Meanwhile the French took possession of the bridge,  being at a considerable disadvantage from German rifle fire from the  cliffs. The solid stone abutments of the bridge, however, enabled the  French to hold that position until strong reenforcements arrived early  in the afternoon. While French infantry cleared the environs of Germans,  their artillery bombarded the fort from the west bank. Their shells  played havoc with the old fort defenses, soon compelling its evacuation  by the Germans. One of the first French artillery shells blew into  shreds the German flag flying triumphantly over the fort, thus depriving  the French of the satisfaction of hauling it down. Toward evening the  Germans retreated toward the Lesse, followed by the French. In previous  wars the forces engaged were of sufficient strength to designate Dinant  a battle, but with the vast armies of the present conflict it sinks to  the military grade of a mere affair. However, it is called by the French  the Battle of Dinant.    The troops which entered Alsace on August 7, 1914, to the number of  18,000 to 20,000, belonged to the army of the frontier.    This first army, which was under the orders of General Dubail, was  intrusted with the mission of making a vigorous attack and of holding in  front of it the greatest possible number of German forces. The general  in command of this army had under his orders, if the detachment from  Alsace be included, five army corps and a division of cavalry. His  orders were to seek battle along the line Saarburg--Donon, in the Bruche  Valley, at the same time possessing himself of the crests of the Vosges  as well as the mountain passes. These operations were to have as their  theaters: (1) the Vosges Mountains, (2) the plateau of Lorraine to the  northwest of Donon, and (3) the left bank of the Meurthe. This left bank  of the Meurthe is separated from the valley of the Moselle by a  bristling slope of firs, which is traversed by a series of passages, the  defiles of Chipotte, of the Croix Idoux, of the Haut Jacques d'Anozel,  of Vanemont, of Plafond. In these passes, when the French returned to  the offensive in September, 1914, furious combats took place. The German  forces opposed to this first army consisted of five active army corps  and a reserve corps.    The first French army, after a violent struggle, conquered the passes of  the Vosges, but the conquest was vigorously opposed and took more time  than the French had reckoned on. As soon as it had become master of the  Donon and the passes, the first French army pushed forward into the  defile of Saarburg. At St. Blaise it won the first German colors, took  Blamont and Cirey (August 15, 1914), seized the defiles north of the  canal of the Marne and the Rhine, and reached Saarburg. Here a  connection was established with the army of Lorraine, which had  commenced its operations on the 14th. A violent battle ensued, known  under the name of the Battle of Saarburg. The left wing of the French  army attacked August 19, 1914; it hurled itself at the fortified  positions, which were copiously fringed with heavy artillery. In spite  of the opposition it made progress to the northwest of Saarburg.    On the 20th the attack was renewed, but from the beginning it was  evident that it could not succeed and that the duty intrusted to the  Eighth Army Corps of opening up the way for the cavalry corps could not  be accomplished. This army corps had gone through a trying ordeal as a  result of the bombardment by the heavy German artillery established in  fortified positions, covering distances all measured in advance, with  every group and French battery presenting a sure target and the action  of the French cannon rendered useless.    If the left wing of the First Army found itself checked, the center and  the right on the other hand were in an excellent position and were able  to advance. But at this point (August 21, 1914) the Second French Army  the army of Lorraine met a serious reverse in the"]]]
