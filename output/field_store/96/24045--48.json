State Rights meant to him, the  rights of the States IN the Union, and not OUT of the Union.    In evidence of the confidence and esteem in which Mr. Johnson was  generally held by those who knew him and knew of the valuable services  he had rendered the cause of the Union, the following letter from Mr.  Stanton, then secretary of War under Mr. Lincoln, is here reproduced.  It was written to Mr. Johnson on his tender to the War Office of his  resignation of the Military Governorship of Tennessee to accept the  office of Vice President of the United States:    War Department, Washington, March 3, 1865.    Sir:--This Department has accepted your resignation as Brigadier General  and Military Governor of Tennessee. Permit me on this occasion to tender  to you the sincere thanks of this Department for your patriotic and able  services during the eventful period through which you have exercised the  highest trust committed to your charge. In one of the darkest hours of  the great struggle for National existence, against rebellious foes, the  Government called you from the comparatively safe and easy duties of  civil life to place you in front of the enemy and in a position of  personal toil and danger, perhaps more hazardous than was encountered  by any citizen or military officer of the United States. With patriotic  promptness you assumed the post, and maintained it under circumstances  of unparalleled trial, until recent events have brought safety and  deliverance to your State and to the integrity of the Constitutional  Union, for which you so long and so gallantly periled all that is dear  to man on earth. That you may be spared to enjoy the new honors and  perform the high duties to which you have been called by the people of  the United States, is the sincere wish of one who in every official  and personal relation has found you worthy of the confidence of the  Government and the honor and esteem of your fellow citizens.    Your obedient servant,    Edwin M. Stanton.    His Excellency, Andrew Johnson, Vice-President elect.        CHAPTER III. --  MR. JOHNSON'S ACCESSION TO THE PRESIDENCY.    THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA.    Mr. Johnson succeeded to the Presidential office on the death of  Mr. Lincoln, April 15th, 1865. The conditions of the time were  extraordinary. The war, so far as operations in the field were  concerned, was at an end. The armies of the rebellion had been  vanquished and practically disbanded. The States lately in revolt  were prostrate at the feet of the conqueror, powerless for further  resistance. But the general rejoicing over the happy termination of the  strife had been inexpressibly saddened by the brutal assassination of  the President who had so wisely and successfully conducted his great  office and administered all its powers to the attainment of that happy  result, and it was not unnatural or strange that the shocking event  should greatly re-inflame the passions of the strife that the joys of  peace had at last well nigh laid.    It was an especial misfortune that he who had so wisely and safely  conducted the Nation through the conflict of arms and had foreshadowed  his beneficent measures of peace and the restoration of the shattered  Republic, was taken away as he and the Nation stood at last at the open  door of successful rehabilitation on a broader and grander basis than  had ever been reached in all previous efforts of man at Nation building.  From day to day he had watched, with his hand on the key-board, the  development and trend of events. They had resulted as he had planned,  and he had become the most conspicuous, the best loved, and the most  masterful of living man in the control of the future. In his death the  Union lost its most sagacious and best trusted leader, and, the South  its ablest, truest, and wisest friend.    It was under these circumstances that Mr. Johnson came to the Presidency  as Mr. Lincoln's successor--without a moment of warning or an hour of  preparation for the discharge of the crushing responsibilities that had  so suddenly fallen to his direction.    Actuated, doubtless, and not unnaturally, by feelings of resentment  over the manner and circumstances of Mr. Lincoln's death, Mr. Johnson at  first gave expression to a spirit of hostility toward the leaders of the  rebellion, and foreshadowed a somewhat rigorous policy in his methods  of Reconstruction in accordance with the views of the leaders of the  Republican party in Congress who had differed with Mr. Lincoln on that  subject; but later on, under the advice of his Cabinet--notably, it is  understood, of Mr. Seward--and under the responsibility of action--his  views became modified, till in time, it is not impossible, but by no  means certain, that he went even beyond the humane, natural and logical  views and purposes of Mr. Lincoln in that regard.    This did not comport with the purposes of the Congressional faction that  had opposed Mr. Lincoln's plans, which faction, under the pressure of  the general indignation over his murder, quickly rose to the absolute  control of Congress. Mr. Lincoln no longer stood in their way, and Mr.  Johnson was then comparatively unknown to the great mass of the dominant  party, and therefore at a corresponding disadvantage in the controversy.  He had risen step by step to his new position from the humblest walks  of Southern life, and each succeeding step to advancement had been made  through personal conflicts such as few men in public life in this or any  other country had ever borne. It was not unnatural, therefore, that he  should have faith in himself, and in the superiority of his judgment, or  little in that of others--and more especially when he was approached by  those who had opposed Mr. Lincoln's plans in an attitude of dictation,  and with suggestions and unsought advice as to the course he should  pursue in the then absorbing question of the restoration of the States  lately in rebellion--himself a citizen of one of those States, and for  the preservation of which, as a State in the Union, he had staked his  life.    As with Mr. Lincoln, so with Mr. Johnson--the first thing to be done, or  sought, was the restoration of the Union by the return of the States  in rebellion to their allegiance to the Constitution and laws of the  country. Mr. Lincoln, to use one of his characteristic Western phrases,  had \"blazed the way,\" and Mr. Johnson took up that trail. A few weeks  after his inauguration he issued a Proclamation outlining a plan for  the reorganization of the State of North Carolina. That paper was  confessedly designed as a general plan and basis for Executive action in  the restoration of all the seceded States. Mr. Lincoln had, of course,  foreseen that that subject would come up very shortly, in the then  condition of affairs in the South, and it had therefore been considered  in his later Cabinet meetings, as stated, more especially at the  meeting immediately preceding his death, and a plan very similar to that  afterwards determined upon by Mr. Johnson, if not identically so, was  at that meeting finally adopted. That plan was set out in the North  Carolina Proclamation, the essential features and general character of  which became so conspicuous a factor in the subsequent controversies  between the President and Congress. It was as follows:    Whereas: The Fourth Section of the Fourth Article of the Constitution  of the United States declares that the United States shall guarantee  to every State in the Union a Republican form of Government, and  shall protect each of them against invasion and domestic violence; and  whereas, the President of the United States is, by the Constitution,  made Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, as well as chief civil  executive officer of the United States, and is bound by solemn oath  faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States,  and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and whereas, the  rebellion which has been waged by a portion of the people of the United  States against the properly constituted authority of the Government  thereof in the most violent and revolting form, but whose organized  and armed forces have now been almost entirely overcome has, in its  revolutionary progress, deprived the people of the State of North  Carolina of all civil government: and whereas, it becomes necessary and  proper to carry out and enforce the obligations of the United States  to the people of North Carolina in securing them it, the enjoyment of a  republican form of Government:    Now, therefore, in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed upon  me by the Constitution of the United States, and for the purpose of  enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a State Government;  whereby justice may be established, domestic tranquility insured, I,  Andrew Johnson, President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief  of the Army and Navy of the United States, do hereby appoint William W.  Holden Provisional Governor of the State of North Carolina, whose duty  it shall be, at the earliest practicable period, to prescribe such  rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening it  Convention, composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the  people of the said State who are loyal all to the United States and  no others, for the purpose of altering or amending the Constitution  thereof; and with authority to exercise, within the limits of said  State, all the powers necessary and proper to enable such loyal  people of the State of North Carolina to restore said State to its  constitutional relations to the Federal Government, and to present such  a republican form of State Government as will entitle the said State  to the guarantee of the United States therefor, and its people to  protection by the United States against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24421"],[0,"The Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue and Raven the Skald (#8)"],[1,"skald.    They had children together not a few, one of them was called Thorarin,  another Thorstein, and yet more they had.    But Helga's chief joy was to pluck at the threads of that cloak,  Gunnlaug's gift, and she would be ever gazing at it.    But on a time there came a great sickness to the house of Thorkel and  Helga, and many were bed-ridden for a long time. Helga also fell sick,  and yet she could not keep abed.    So one Saturday evening Helga sat in the fire-hall, and leaned her head  upon her husband's knees, and had the cloak Gunnlaug's gift sent for;  and when the cloak came to her she sat up and plucked at it, and gazed  thereon awhile, and then sank back upon her husband's bosom, and was  dead. Then Thorkel sang this:--             \"Dead in mine arms she droopeth,            My dear one, gold-rings bearer,            For God hath changed the life-days            Of this Lady of the linen.

AND HERE ENDETH THE STORY."]]]
