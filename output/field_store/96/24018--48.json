[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23666"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 3 (#8)"],[1,"the Dining-Room Set]    There are various ways of arranging the slides to work one with the  other. Several patented devices are on the market that permit a ready  adjustment with but little effort and are used extensively by commercial  manufacturers. The amateur will do well to secure a set before he  undertakes to work these slides to shape.    Prepare the legs by cutting them to length. Lay out and work the  mortises. The ends of the facings are to be tenoned and housed into the  posts. Prepare the rails by cutting the tenons and shaping the lower  edges as shown in the drawing. Prepare the top. After this, assemble  this much of the frame, using plenty of clamps and good hot glue.    Next get the under frame and the slides ready and attach them as shown.  There will be needed plenty of glue blocks for reinforcing the facing  where it is fastened to the top, etc.    For a finish, apply a filler colored, as desired. Upon this, after it  has hardened and been sanded with No. 00 paper, apply a coat of shellac.  Upon the shellac apply successively several coats of some good rubbing  varnish. Rub the first coats with haircloth and the final coat with  pulverized pumice and crude or linseed oil.    If an effect is wanted that will contrast, stain the wood first with a  water stain. Sand this lightly when dry, then apply a second coat of  stain diluted one-half with water. Again sand and then apply a thin coat  of shellac. Sand this lightly, and apply the filler and the varnish as  described above.          AN ARM DINING CHAIR      [Illustration: Armchair of the Dining-Room Set]    This armchair will look well if made of plain-sawed oak. Quarter-sawed  oak might be used, or black walnut if desired. The stock bill specifies  the various parts mill-planed to size as far as possible. If some  amateur craftsman should prefer to do his own surfacing, thereby saving  somewhat on the expense, he should add 1/4 in. to the width of each  piece, providing the stock is mill-planed to thickness. It is hardly  profitable to get stock entirely in the rough if the work is to be done  by hand. The following is the stock bill:      2 front posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 25 in., S-4-S.    1 piece for back posts, 1-3/4 by 6 by 43 in., S-2-S.    2 arm pieces, 7/8 by 4 by 24-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 seat rails, 1 by 2-1/2 by 22 in., S-4-S.    2 seat rails, 1 by 2-1/2 by 24 in., S-4-S.    4 lower side rails, 5/8 by 1-1/2 by 22 in., S-4-S.    2 front and back lower rails, 5/8 by 2-3/4 by 24 in., S-4-S.    1 back rail, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 24 in., S-4-S.    1 back rail, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 24 in., S-4-S.    2 slats, 3/8 by 2 by 16-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 slat, 3/8 by 4-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 braces, 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 5-1/2 in., S-2-S.    The design shown is for a chair in which the width of front and back is  the same. Also the back leg parallels the front below the seat. In  commercial practice the backs are usually made somewhat narrower than  the fronts and the back leg is slanted somewhat below the seat as well  as above. As this construction necessitates sloping shoulders on all  tenons it complicates the problem when the work is not done by  machinery. The ambitious amateur may readily get the proportion of slant  by measuring common chairs. For mission effects the chair looks well  with front and back the same width.    Prepare the front posts first and then the rear. The rear posts are to  be cut from the single piece of stock specified. By proper planning both  pieces may be gotten out without trouble. Lay off and cut the mortises.    Saw the rails to length and lay out and cut the tenons. The back rails  are to have mortises in their edges to receive the ends of the slats.  Instead of tenoning these slats make mortises large enough to receive  the whole end--in other words, house the ends.    Shape the two arms, then glue up the back and then the front of the  chair. After the glue has set sufficiently, assemble the remainder of  the parts.    [Illustration: Detail of the Armchair]    Thoroughly scrape and sandpaper the parts and then apply the finish.    For a seat, either a leather cushion may be placed upon slats or the  bottom may be upholstered in the usual manner, using webbing on heavy  canvas, and then felt or hair with a top of canvas and leather; the  whole being firmly fastened with tacks and the leather with ornamental  nails.          A HALL BENCH      All the stock for this bench should be of 7/8-in. oak, excepting the  slats, which may be of a cheaper wood. The following list of lumber will  be required to build it:      4 slats, 7/8 by 4 by 17 in., cheap wood.    2 cleats, 7/8 by 1 by 26 in., cheap wood.    4 end rails, 7/8 by 2 by 16-1/4 in., oak, S-2-S.    2 ends, 7/8 by 16 by 16-1/4 in., oak, S-2-S.    2 sides, 7/8 by 4 by 25 in., oak, S-2-S.    2 pieces, 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 25 in., oak, S-2-S.    [Illustration: Detail of the Hall Bench]    Start the work by first cutting the two pieces of 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 25-in.  material diagonally 1 in. from each corner, thus making the legs. The  edges are planed square and the ends should be rounded a little so that  there will be no splinters projecting. The legs are mortised 1 in. deep  for the side rails. The tenon ends are cut on the rails, care being  taken to get the right angle and a good fit. These can now be fastened  together, using hot glue on the entire surface of the joint.    [Illustration: Bench Made of Plain Oak]    While these are drying the ends can be made as shown in the plan. The 3  by 4-in. holes are cut at equal distances apart. Be sure that each end  is perfectly square, then glue and dowel the 2-in. strips at each end.  The ends are then glued and nailed to the sides, using finishing nails,  which are set and the holes filled with colored putty.    The cleats are now fastened, extra care being taken when fastening them  over the joints where the legs receive the side rails, as this will help  to strengthen the joints. The slats rest on these cleats and are placed  at equal distances apart.    The bench is now finished, but before applying the stain, see that all  parts are free from glue and are well sandpapered.    The leather cushion should be the loose kind and of a shade to harmonize  with the finish.          A SEWING TABLE      This convenient and useful table will be much appreciated by any woman.  It has two drawers for sewing material, and two drop leaves to spread  the work upon.    The following list of material will be needed for its construction. The  sizes given are exact, so if the stock cannot be bought at a mill ready  planed and squared, a slight allowance must be made for this.      4 posts, 1-1/4 by 1-1/4 by 27 in., S-4-S.    9 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 14-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 top, 7/8 by 18 by 18 in., S-2-S.    2 leaves, 7/8 by 10 by 18 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5 by 13-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 drawer sides, 3/8 by 5 by 13 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer backs, 3/8 by 4-1/8 by 13 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 12-3/4 by 13 in., S-2-S.    4 drawer slides, 7/8 by 2 by 13 in., S-2-S.    3 panels, 3/8 by 9-3/8 by 14 in., S-2-S.    2 brackets, 7/8 by 3 by 4 in., S-2-S.    Have the surfaces of the legs exactly square with each other. The ends  must be square with all surfaces, but need not be planed smooth as  neither will be seen in the finished table.    [Illustration: Sewing Table in Plain Oak]    Arrange the rails in position. The two rails in each side and back are  placed with the 2-in. surface out, while the three in the front have the  2-in. surface up for the drawers to slide upon. Mark the tenons, 1 in,  by 3/8 in., with a knife and gauge lines on each end of the rails for  the sides and back. Mark the tenons, 3/4 in. by 7/8 in., as shown in the  sketch, on each end of front rails. Cut all the tenons with a backsaw  and smooth them with a chisel.    [Illustration: Detail of the Sewing Table]    Carefully mark the mortises in the legs, taking measurements for each  mortise from the tenon which is to go into it. Fit together all rails  and legs without glue to detect any errors.    See that the panels for sides and back are squared up true and the  surfaces smooth. Mark the grooves for the panels in the side and back  rails and legs. Cut the grooves with a chisel or plow plane to a depth  of 1/4 in.    Glue up the joints and clamp the two table sides first. While the glue  is setting, square up and smooth the top and two leaves perfectly.    Now glue up the whole table, having set in the front and back rails and  panel. The drawer slides, two on each side, should next be put in. A  nail through them and into each leg will hold them, as there is only the  weight of the drawers resting on them. Fasten the top with screws  through the rails from the under side. The leaves are attached with two  2-in. butt hinges which must be set in flush with the under surface to  prevent a crack showing between the table top and leaf when the latter  is raised. The small bracket hinged to the panel supports the open leaf.    [Illustration: Construction of the Drawer]    The drawers are now made. Allow the side to lap over the front 1/2 in.  as shown in sketch and fasten it with nails. The bottom should be let  into the sides and front 1/4 in., but must not be nailed to them,  because this would cause the drawer to stick, when the bottom expands.    Metal rings or wooden knobs will do well for the drawer pulls.    Stain to any desired shade and finish with a wax if a dull gloss is  wanted, or with one coat of shellac and two coats of varnish for a  highly polished surface.          A SIDE CHAIR      A companion piece to the chair with arms and the sideboard is the side  chair illustrated herewith. It should be made of the same kind of wood  and finished to correspond with the armchair. Order the following stock  list:      2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 18-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 piece for back posts, 1-1/2 by 5-1/2 by 38-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 seat rails, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#8)"],[1,"was the best basket-maker on the  river.    So they took a sharp stick, and went into the woods. Akoko looked for  spruce trees that had been blown down by the storm, but found none, so  she stopped under some standing spruce, at a place with no underbrush  and said: \"See, Nagami, here we dig for wattap.\"    The spruce roots or \"wattap\" were near the surface and easily found, but  not easily got out, because they were long, tangled and criss-crossed.  Yet, by pulling up, and cutting under, they soon got a bundle of roots  like cords, and of different lengths, from two feet to a yard, or more.    \"Good,\" said Akoko; \"this is enough and we need not soak them, for it is  summer, and the sap is running. If it were fall we should have to boil  them. Now you must scrape them clear of the brown bark.\" So Nagami took  her knife and worked for an hour, then came with the bundle saying:  \"See, Mother, they are smooth, and so white that they have not a brown  spot left.\" \"Good,\" said Akoko, \"now you need some bark of the willow  for sewing cord. Let us look along the river bank.\"    There they found the round-leafed, or fish-net willow, and stripped off  enough of its strong bark to make a bundle as big as one hand could  hold.    This also had to be scraped clear of the brown skin, leaving only the  strong whitish inner bark, which, when split into strips, was good for  sewing.    \"See, my Nagami, when I was a little girl I had only a bone needle made  from the leg of a deer, but you have easy work; here is a big steel  packing needle, which I bought for you from a trader. This is how you  make your basket.\"    So Akoko began a flat coil with the spruce roots, and sewed it together  with the willow bark for thread, until it was a span wide. And whenever  a new root was to be added, she cut both old piece and new, to a long  point, so they would overlap without a bump.    Then the next coil of the spruce roots was laid on, not flat and level,  but raised a little. Also the next, until the walls were as high as four  fingers. Then Akoko said, \"Good, that is enough. It is a fine corn  basket. But we must give it a red rim for good luck.\"    So they sought in a sunny place along the shore, and found the fruit of  the squawberry or blitum. \"See,\" said Akoko, \"the miscawa. Gather a  handful, my Nagami. They make the red basket-dye.\"    They crushed the rich red berries, saving the red juice in a clam shell,  and soaked a few strands of the white willow bark in the stain. When  they were dry, Nagami was taught to add a rim to her basket, by sewing  it over and over as in the picture.    Then Akoko said, \"Good, my little Bird-Singer, you have done well, you  have made some old black roots into a beautiful basket.\"           *       *       *       *       *    N.B. The Guide will remember that rattan and raffia can be used for this  when it is impossible to get spruce roots and willow bark. Good dyes may  be made from many different berries.      TALE 22    Crinkleroot; or Who Hid the Salad?    It has long been the custom of the Brownies to have a great feast on the  first of the merry month of May, to celebrate the return of the spring.    [Illustration: The Crinkleroot; or Who Hid the Salad?]    One springtime long ago, they got ready as usual. The King of the  Brownies had invited all the leaders; the place for the dinner was  chosen in a grove of mandrakes whose flat umbrellas made a perfect  roof, rain or shine. The Bell Bird, whose other name is Wood Thrush, was  ringing his bell, and calling all the Chief Brownies by name.    \"Ta-rool-ya! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"    \"Oka-lee! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"    \"Cherk! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"    \"Come to the feasting! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"    A hundred glow worms were told to hurry up with their lights and be  ready for that night, and busy Brownies gathered good things from woods  and waters, for the feast.    May Day came bright and beautiful. The busy ones had all the \"eats\" in  the Mandrake Hall, the glowworms were sleeping soundly to fill their  storage batteries ready for the night. It made the salamanders' mouths  water to see so many good things; but they were not asked, so stayed  away. There were dewdrops in acorn cups, and honey on the wax. There  were clam shells piled up with red checkerberries, and caddis worms on  the half shell, with spicebush nubbins. A huge white Mecha-meck was the  chief dish, with bog nuts on the side. There were lovely long crinkle  salads. And last, there were gumdrops from the sweet birch, while at  each place was a pussy willow to dust the food over with golden pollen  that gave it a pleasant peppery tang. All the guests were there, and the  feast was nearly over, when a terrible thing took place!    Of all the dreaded happenings in the world of beauty there is nothing  else so feared as the forest fire. There is not much danger of it in  springtime, but it is possible at any season, after a long dry spell.  Words cannot tell of the horror it spreads, as it comes raging through  the woods destroying all beautiful living things.    And right in the middle of the feast, the dreadful news was carried by a  flying Night-bird.    \"Fire, Fire, Fire, Fire!\" he screamed, and almost at once the smoke came  drifting through the banquet hall, so they knew it was true.    There was mad haste to escape, and only two ways were open. One was to  get across some big stream, and the other was to hide in a cave  underground. The birds took the first way, and the Brownies the second.  Every Woodchuck den was just packed with Brownies within a few minutes.  But the busy Brownie who was chief steward and had charge of the feast,  had no idea of leaving all the good things to burn up, if he could help  it. First he sent six of his helpers to make a deep pit for the big  Mecha-meck, and while they did that he began hiding all the dishes in  the ground. Last he dug some deep holes and quickly buried all the  crinkle salads; then he ran for his life into a cave.    The raging fire came along. It is too horrible to tell about, for it was  sent by the Evil One. The lovely woods were left black without a living  thing. But the very next day, Mother Carey and Mother Earth and El Sol,  set about saving the wreck, and in a marvellously short time actually  had made it green again. The mayflowers came up a second time that year,  the violets came back, and in each place where the Brownies had hid a  salad there came up a curious plant that never had been seen before. It  had three saw-edged leaves and a long wand, much like the one carried by  the Chief Steward. I never was able to find out his name for sure, but I  think it was Trileaf or Three-leaves. Anyway, if you dig under his sign  and sceptre wand, you will surely find the salad, and very good indeed  it is to eat; it was not hurt in the least by the fire.    [Illustration: The Mecha-meck]    But from that day, the Brownies have been very shy of feasting during  dry weather in the woods. They generally have their banquets now in some  meadow, and afterward you can tell the place of the feast by the circle  of little toadstools called fairy rings. For you know that wherever a  Brownie sits, a toadstool must spring up for him to sit on.      TALE 23    The Mecha-meck    That fearful time when the forest fire set all the Brownies busy burying  their food and dishes at the feast-hall, you remember it took six of  them to carry and hide the Mecha-meck. For it is a large fat white root  as big as a baby, and sometimes it has arms or legs, so that when  Monapini told Ruth Pilgrim about it she called it \"Man-of-the-earth.\"    You remember that the busy Brownie hid all the Crinkle salads, and so  saved them; and most of us have found the Crinkleroot and eaten it  since. But how many of us have found the Mecha-meck? I know only one man  who has. We call him the Wise Woodman. He found and dug out the one from  which I made the picture. It was two and a half feet long and weighed  fifteen pounds--fifteen pounds of good food. Think of it! Above it and  growing out of its hiding place was a long trailing vine that looked  like a white morning-glory. There is always one of these over the  Mecha-meck. And by that you may find it, if you look along the sunny  banks outside of the woods. But still it is very hard to find. I never  yet got one, though I have found many of the crinkle-root salads. Of  course, that is easy to explain, for the busy Brownies buried hundreds  of the salads, but only one of the big fat Mecha-meck.      TALE 24    Dutchman's Breeches    [Illustration: Dutchman's Dive    Dutchman's Breeches]    Of course they are not, for no Dutchman I ever saw could wear such tiny  things. I will tell you what they really are and how that came to be.    You remember how the Brownies assembled for the feast on May Day when  the Glow worms were the lamps and the Wood Thrush rang the bell. Well,  it so happened that day that a great crowd of the merrymakers gathered  long before the feast was ready, and while they were wondering what to  do someone shouted: \"See, how fine and warm the water is where the brook  spreads out into the ditch. Let us have our first swim of the season  right now!\"    So they all went with a whoop! stripped off their clothes, and into  their swimming breeches with a perfect riot of glee.    Then how they did splash! Some blind folks thought it must be a million  early pollywogs splashing. But the swim ended with another racket when  the dinner bell rang.    Each splashing Brownie hopped out and hung up his breeches to dry as he  got into his clothes.    Then you remember the fire came along and scared them away. Of course  the breeches were wet, so they didn't get singed; and there you can see  them hanging to this day on the first of May. That is what they really  are--Brownies' Breeches. And because the Brownies often swim in a ditch,  they are called ditch-man's breeches; but"]]]
