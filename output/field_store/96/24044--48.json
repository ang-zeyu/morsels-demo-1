Then, he  is very lively and dearly loves to play.  By nature he is gentle  and lovable.\"    \"Does he eat nuts like his cousins?\" asked Peter Rabbit.    \"He certainly does,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Also he eats  grubs and insects.  He dearly loves a fat beetle.  He likes meat  when he can get it.\"    \"Where does he make his home?\" Peter inquired.    \"Usually in a hole in a tree,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"He is very  fond of an old home of a Woodpecker.  He makes a comfortable nest  of bark lining, grass, and moss, or any other soft material he can  find.  Occasionally he builds an outside nest high up in a fork in  the branches of a tree.  He likes to get into old buildings.\"    \"Does he have many enemies?\" asked Happy Jack.    \"The same enemies the rest of you have,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"But the one he has most reason to fear is Hooty the Owl, and that  is the one you have least reason to fear, because Hooty seldom hunts  by day.\"    \"Does he sleep all winter?\" piped up Striped Chipmunk.    \"Not as you do,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"In very cold weather he  sleeps, but if he happens to be living where the weather does not  get very cold, he is active all the year around.  Now I guess this  is enough about the Squirrel family.\"    \"You've forgotten Johnny Chuck,\" cried Peter.    Old Mother Nature laughed.  \"So I have,\" said she.  \"That will  never do, never in the world.  Johnny and his relatives, the  Marmots, certainly cannot be overlooked.  We will take them for  our lesson to-morrow.  Peter, you tell Johnny Chuck to come over  here to-morrow morning.\"        CHAPTER VII  Johnny Chuck Joins the Class    Peter Rabbit delivered Mother Nature's message to Johnny Chuck.  Johnny didn't seem at all pleased.  He grumbled and growled to  himself.  He didn't want to go to school.  He didn't want to learn  anything about his relatives.  He was perfectly satisfied with  things as they were.  The truth is, Johnny Chuck was already  beginning to get fat with good living and he is naturally lazy.  As a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home, so he  seldom goes far from his own doorstep.  Peter left him grumbling  and growling, and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear  Old Briar-patch.  He knew that Johnny Chuck would not dare disobey  Old Mother Nature.    Sure enough, the next morning Johnny Chuck came waddling through  the Green Forest just as Old Mother Nature was about to open school.  He didn't look at all happy, and he didn't reply at all to the  greetings of the others.  But when Old Mother Nature spoke to him  he was very polite.    \"Good morning, Johnny Chuck,\" said she.    Johnny bobbed his head and said, \"Good morning.\"    \"I understand,\" continued Old Mother Nature, \"That you are not at  all interested in learning about your relatives.  I am sorry for  any one who doesn't want to learn.  The more one knows the better  fitted he is to take care of himself and do his part in the work of  the Great World.  However, it wasn't for your benefit that I sent  word for you to be here this morning.  It was for the benefit of  your friends and neighbors.  Now sit up so that all can get a good  look at you.\"    Johnny Chuck obediently sat up, and of course all the others stared  at him.  It made him feel quite uncomfortable.  \"You remember,\"  said Old Mother Nature, \"how surprised you little folks were when  I told you that Johnny Chuck is a member of the Squirrel family.  Happy Jack, you go sit beside Johnny Chuck, and the rest of you  look hard at Happy Jack and Johnny and see if you do not see a  family resemblance.\"    Seeing Happy Jack and Johnny Chuck sitting up side by side, Peter  Rabbit caught the resemblance at once.  There was sort of family  look about them.  \"Why!  Why-ee!  Johnny Chuck does look like a  Squirrel,\" he exclaimed.    \"Of course he looks like a Squirrel, because he is one,\" said Old  Mother Nature.  \"Johnny Chuck is very much bigger and so stout in  the body that he has none of the gracefulness of the true Squirrels.  But you will notice that the shape of his head is much the same as  that of Happy Jack.  He has a Squirrel face when you come to look at  him closely.  The Woodchucks, sometimes called Ground Hogs, though  why any one should call them this is more than I can understand,  belong to the Marmot branch of the Squirrel family, and wherever  found they look much alike.    \"As you will notice, Johnny Chuck's coat is brownish-yellow, his  feet are very dark brown, almost black.  His head is dark brown with  light gray on his cheeks.  Beneath he is reddish-orange, including  his throat.  His tail is short for a member of the Squirrel family,  and although it is bushy, it is not very big.  He has a number of  whiskers and they are black.  Some Woodchucks are quite gray, and  occasionally there is one who is almost, or wholly black, just as  there are black Gray Squirrels.    \"Johnny, here, is not fond of the Green Forest, but loves the Old  orchard and the Green Meadows.  In some parts of the country there  are members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the  Green Forest.  You will notice that Johnny has stout claws.  Those  are to help him dig, for all the Marmot family are great diggers.  What other use do you have for those claws, Johnny?\"    \"They help me to climb,\" replied Johnny promptly.    \"Climb!\" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  \"Who ever heard of a Woodchuck  climbing?\"    \"I can climb if I have to,\" retorted Johnny Chuck indignantly.  \"I've  climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times, and if I can get a good  run first, I can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark  to the first branches--if they are not too far above ground.  You ask  Reddy Fox if I can't; he knows.\"    \"That's quite true, Johnny,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"You can climb  a little, but as a real climber you are not much of a success.  You  are better as a digger.\"    \"He certainly is all right as a digger,\" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  \"My, how he can make the sand fly!  Johnny Chuck certainly is right  at home when it comes to digging.\"    \"You ought to be thankful that he is,\" said Old Mother Nature, \"for  the holes he has dug have saved your life more than once.  By the  way, Peter, since you are so well acquainted with those holes,  suppose you tell us what kind of a home Johnny Chuck has.\"    Peter was delighted to air his knowledge.  \"The last one I was in,\"  said he, \"was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and  then straightening out.  The entrance was quite large with a big  heap of sand out in front of it.  Down a little way the tunnel  grew smaller and then remained the same size all the rest of the way.  Way down at the farther end was a nice little bedroom with some grass  in it.  There were one or two other little rooms, and there were two  branch tunnels leading up to the surface of the ground, making side  or back doorways.  There was no sand around either of these, and they  were quite hidden by the long grass hanging over them.  I don't  understand how Johnny made those doorways without leaving any sand  on the doorsteps.\"    \"Huh!\" interrupted Johnny Chuck.  \"That was easy enough.  I pushed  all the sand out of the main doorway so that there would be nothing  to attract the attention of any one passing near those back doorways.  Those back doorways are very handy in time of danger.\"    \"Do you always have three doorways?\" asked Happy Jack.    \"No,\" replied Johnny Chuck.  \"Sometimes I have only two and once in  a while only one.  But that isn't really safe, and I mean always to  have at least two.\"    \"Do you use the same house year after year?\" piped up Striped Chipmunk.    Johnny shook his head.  \"No,\" said he.  \"I dig a new hole each spring.  Mrs. Chuck and I like a change of scene.  Usually my new home isn't  very far from my old one, because I am not fond of traveling.  Sometimes, however, if we cannot find a place that just suits us,  we go quite a distance.\"    \"Are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground?\"  asked Jumper the Hare.    \"Of course,\" replied Johnny Chuck.  \"Where else would they be born?\"    \"I didn't know but Mrs. Chuck might make a nest on the ground the  way Mrs. Peter and Mrs. Jumper do,\" replied Jumper meekly.    \"No, siree!\" replied Johnny.  \"Our babies are born in that little  underground bedroom, and they stay down in the ground until they  are big enough to hunt for food for themselves.\"    \"How many do you usually have?\" inquired Chatterer the Red Squirrel.    \"Six or eight,\" replied Johnny Chuck.  \"Mrs. Chuck and I believe  in large families.\"    \"Do you eat nuts like the rest of our family?\" inquired  Striped Chipmunk.    \"No,\" replied Johnny Chuck.  \"Give me green food every time.  There  is nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass, unless  it be some of those fine vegetables Farmer Brown grows in his garden.\"    Peter Rabbit nodded his head very emphatically as if he quite agreed.    \"I suppose you are what is called a vegetarian, then,\" said Happy  Jack, to which Johnny Chuck replied that he supposed he was.  \"And  I suppose that is why you sleep all winter,\" added Happy Jack.    \"If I didn't I would starve,\" responded Johnny Chuck promptly.  \"When it gets near time for Jack Frost to arrive, I stuff and stuff  and stuff on the last of the good green things until I'm so fat I  can hardly waddle.  Then I go down to my bedroom, curl up and go  to sleep.  Cold weather, snow and ice don't worry me a bit.\"    \"I know,\" spoke up Striped Chipmunk.  \"I sleep most of the winter  myself.  Of course I have a lot of food stored away down in my  house, and once in a while I wake up and eat a little.  Do you  ever wake up in the winter, Johnny Chuck?\"    \"No,\" replied Johnny.  \"I sleep right through, thank goodness.  Sometimes I wake up very early in the spring before the snow is  all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#8)"],[1,"years, and it would be strange if I did not find that my  views on many Indian subjects have been greatly modified, and on all  much enlarged; but I do not discover that on any subject there has been  a complete reversal.    I have already mentioned that on my voyage from Calcutta to Benares I  spent much of my time in the study of the Hindustanee language, commonly  called Urdu. Within a week of my arrival I gave myself to it with all  the application of which I was capable. I had as my teacher a munshee,  who had been long employed by the missionaries of our Society, but who  could not speak a sentence in English, though he knew the Roman  character well. I was told that his ignorance of English would prove an  advantage, as I should on this account be obliged to speak to him, in  however broken and limping a fashion, in the language which it was  indispensable for me to acquire. We had before us an English and  Hindustanee Dictionary, a Hindustanee and English Dictionary, a  Hindustanee Grammar, and a book of easy sentences in both languages in  the Roman character. At first my teacher and myself had to put things  into many forms before reaching mutual intelligibility; but gradually  our work became easier, and when two or three months had passed we  fairly understood each other--I trying to express myself in Hindustanee,  and he performing the much-needed work of correcting my words and idiom.  I commenced with a portion of the New Testament, and soon got into some  of the classics of the language. The use of the Roman character in the  writing of Indian languages had been strongly advocated by Sir Charles  Trevelyan, by Dr. Duff, and other men of mark, and was accepted by the  majority of the missionaries. Portions of the Scriptures and other books  were printed in it. Like all young missionaries, I learned the Persian  and Nagree characters, in which the languages of Northern India had  always previously been written; but the Roman character was very  convenient, and I regretted afterwards I used it so much.    This study of the language was felt to be a foremost duty, and was  prosecuted from day to day. This went on for months with little  interruption, except what was caused by the serious and continued  illness of Mrs. Lyon, which, to the great regret of all their friends,  led before the end of the year to the departure of Mr. and Mrs. L. for  Europe.    In the seventh or eighth month of my residence at Benares I wrote a  short sermon in Hindustanee on John i. 29, and read it at the native  service. Within a year I took my part regularly at that service, first  using my manuscript, and then extemporizing as I best could.    I must confess I regarded my new linguistic acquisition with much more  complacency at the end of my first year than at the end of my fifth or  sixth. On my way to Benares, as I have already mentioned, I spent a few  hours very pleasantly with Mr. Leslie, the Baptist missionary at  Monghyr. I mentioned to him that my friend Mr. Lyon had learned the  language, and was preaching in it. Looking me full in the face, he said,  to my surprise and chagrin, \"Depend on it, Mr. Lyon may use the words of  the language, but no one can be said to acquire it in a year.\" I thought  this a hard saying, but years afterwards I was forced to feel its truth.  I had in a year got such a glimpse into the Hindustanee and Hindee  languages as to have some conceptions of their nature, to know their  tone, and to bring them into partial use; but I had a very limited  notion of their nice distinctions, their peculiar idioms, and their vast  vocabulary. I cannot say that the opinion on this subject I formed in my  first year was entirely reversed by my after experience, but it was  largely modified.    [Sidenote: STUDY OF NATIVE LANGUAGE AND CHARACTER.]    While studying the native language, I felt myself studying the native  character as well. My teacher was very patient, correcting my  mistakes--mistakes, I must confess, often repeated--without allowing  even the slightest surprise to appear in his countenance. He did not  smile at blunders at which, when I knew better, I myself heartily  laughed. When I showed the slightest impatience at being checked he at  once allowed me to go on as I liked, though, as I afterwards knew, I  needed to be corrected. He was loud in praise of my progress, declaring  that I would soon surpass all my predecessors. In my intercourse with  him I had illustrations of the patience, the courtesy, and also the  flattering, cozening character of the people, when dealing with those  by whom they think they can be benefited. The impressions of native  character thus obtained were amply affirmed by the experience of after  years.    This munshee was well acquainted with our Scriptures. He belonged to the  Writer caste, and had from his early years been in contact with  Europeans. He was ready for conversation on religious subjects, and had  much to say in favour of the philosophical notions which underlie  Hinduism. Three or four years afterwards he seemed to awake all at once  to the claims of Christ as the Saviour of the world, and under this  impulse he openly appeared in a native newspaper as the assailant of  Hinduism and the advocate of Christianity, which led to the hope that he  was to avow himself, by baptism, a follower of the Lord. But he became  alarmed at what he had done; he could not bear the reproaches of his  friends, and he fell back into the ranks of his people. Though he had  ceased to be my teacher I had opportunities of seeing him, and I tried  to speak to his conscience, to his conviction of the Divine origin of  the gospel. The last time I spoke to him he said, with marked emphasis,  \"There is no use in speaking to me. Let Hinduism be false or true, I am  determined to live and die in it as my fathers have done!\" His case was  that of many with whom every Indian missionary is brought into contact.    During this year I was introduced into the methods in which evangelistic  work was conducted. In addition to attending the services of the Lord's  Day, I went now and then with my brethren to the city. We had at that  time two little chapels in good positions, at the doors of which the  people were first addressed, and were then invited to enter that they  might hear the new teaching more fully expounded. There was, of course,  nothing of the staidness or quietness of a Christian congregation. The  speaker was often interrupted; questions, sometimes very irrelevant  questions, were asked; and the people came and went, so that those who  were present at the commencement were seldom present at the close.  During the year I saw the principal places in Benares--its main streets  and markets, its temples and mosques; and thus formed some idea of the  great city, where for many years afterwards it was my privilege to  labour in the gospel of Christ.    [Sidenote: THE LANGUAGES OF NORTHERN INDIA.]    The work of the missionary in Northern India would be greatly simplified  if he had to learn only one language. He has to learn the two I have  named, the Hindustanee and the Hindee. The Hindustanee arose from  intercourse between the Muhammadan invaders and the people they had  subdued. It is written in the Persian or Arabic character, and draws its  vocabulary mainly from the Persian and Arabic languages. It is the  language of law, of commerce, and of ordinary life to many millions. The  Hindee in its various dialects, some of which almost rise to the dignity  of languages, is the vernacular of the vast Hindu population of  North-Western India. It rests mainly on the Sanscrit, and is written in  the Sanscrit or Deonagree character. In some of the most popular books  the languages are so strangely combined that it is impossible to give  any definite name to the language used. An acquaintance with these  languages is indispensable to missionary efficiency in Northern India,  but it is very difficult to attain marked excellence in both.          CHAPTER VI.    THE FIRST YEAR--SOCIETY AND CLIMATE.      A very brief residence at Benares led me to see the great difference  between the society to which I had come and that which I had left. The  European community formed a mere handful of the population, and was  almost exclusively formed of officials, with all the peculiarities of a  class privileged by office. We had some two hundred European  artillerymen with their officers, of a regiment paid and controlled by  the East India Company; three native regiments officered by Europeans;  three or four members of the Civil Service, charged with the  administration of the city and district; one English merchant, and two  or three English shopkeepers. I now learned for the first time the  difference in rank between Queen's and Company's military officers. The  Queen's officer regarded himself as of a higher grade. Members of the  Civil Service and Company's officers met on terms of social equality;  but the Civilians looked on themselves as of a higher order, as the  aristocracy of the land, and the assumed superiority put a strain to  some degree on social intercourse. The persons sent out from this  country for the administration of India are called Covenanted Civilians,  as they bear a commission from the Queen; while those engaged for  administrative work by the Indian Government are called Uncovenanted.  The former class continue to have a great official advantage over the  latter; but forty years ago there was a great social inequality which  has in a measure ceased, where these uncovenanted servants are English  gentlemen, as they often are. English merchants were regarded as in  society; but shopkeepers, however large their establishment, were deemed  entirely outside the pale, except for strictly business purposes. This  was partly accounted for by European shopkeepers having been previously  stewards of ships, or soldiers who had received their discharge."]]]
