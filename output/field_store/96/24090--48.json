He looked round to see where the words came from, but there were only  a few flies buzzing about in the kitchen. At the same moment some one  out in the yard said in a harsh jerky voice, \"Where are we going to  settle? Where?\"    And another answered, \"In the miller's barley-field; ho! for the  miller's field of barley.\"    When George looked towards where this strange talk came he saw a  gander flying at the head of a flock of geese.    \"How lucky,\" thought he; \"now I know why my master set so much value  on this fish and wished to eat it all himself.\"    George had now no doubt that by tasting the fish he had learnt the  language of animals, so after having taken a little more he served the  king with the remainder as if nothing had happened.    When his majesty had dined he ordered George to saddle two horses and  accompany him for a ride. They were soon off, the master in front, the  servant behind.    While crossing a meadow George's horse began to prance and caper,  neighing out these words, \"I say, brother, I feel so light and in such  good spirits to-day that in one single bound I could leap over those  mountains yonder.\"    \"I could do the same,\" answered the king's horse, \"but I carry a  feeble old man on my back; he would fall like a log and break his  skull.\"    \"What does that matter to you? So much the better if he should break  his head, for then, instead of being ridden by an old man you would  probably be mounted by a young one.\"    The servant laughed a good deal upon hearing this conversation between  the horses, but he took care to do so on the quiet, lest the king  should hear him. At that moment his majesty turned round, and, seeing  a smile on the man's face, asked the cause of it.    \"Oh nothing, your majesty, only some nonsense that came into my head.\"    The king said nothing, and asked no more questions, but he was  suspicious, and distrusted both servant and horses; so he hastened  back to the palace.    When there he said to George, \"Give me some wine, but mind you only  pour out enough to fill the glass, for if you put in one drop too  much, so that it overflows, I shall certainly order my executioner to  cut off your head.\"    While he was speaking two birds flew near the window, one chasing the  other, who carried three golden hairs in his beak.    \"Give them me,\" said one, \"you know they are mine.\"    \"Not at all, I picked them up myself.\"    \"No matter, I saw them fall while the Maid with Locks of Gold was  combing out her hair. At least, give me two, then you can keep the  third for yourself.\"    \"No, not a single one.\"    Thereupon one of the birds succeeded in seizing the hairs from the  other bird's beak, but in the struggle he let one fall, and it made a  sound as if a piece of metal had struck the ground. As for George, he  was completely taken off his guard, and the wine overflowed the glass.    The king was furious, and feeling convinced that his servant had  disobeyed him and had learnt the language of animals, he said, \"You  scoundrel, you deserve death for having failed to do my bidding,  nevertheless, I will show you mercy upon one condition, that you bring  me the Maid with the Golden Locks, for I intend to marry her.\"    Alas, what was to be done? Poor fellow, he was willing to do anything  to save his life, even run the risk of losing it on a long journey. He  therefore promised to search for the Maid with the Golden Locks: but  he knew not where or how to find her.    When he had saddled and mounted his horse he allowed it to go its own  way, and it carried him to the outskirts of a dark forest, where some  shepherds had left a bush burning. The sparks of fire from the bush  endangered the lives of a large number of ants which had built their  nest close by, and the poor little things were hurrying away in all  directions, carrying their small white eggs with them.    \"Help us in our distress, good George,\" they cried in a plaintive  voice; \"do not leave us to perish, together with our children whom we  carry in these eggs.\"    George immediately dismounted, cut down the bush, and put out the  fire.    \"Thank you, brave man: and remember, when you are in trouble you have  only to call upon us, and we will help you in our turn.\" The young  fellow went on his way far into the forest until he came to a very  tall fir tree. At the top of the tree was a raven's nest, while at the  foot, on the ground, lay two young ones who were calling out to their  parents and saying, \"Alas, father and mother, where have you gone? You  have flown away, and we have to seek our food, weak and helpless as we  are. Our wings are as yet without feathers, how then shall we be able  to get anything to eat? Good George,\" said they, turning to the young  man, \"do not leave us to starve.\"    Without stopping to think, the young man dismounted, and with his  sword slew his horse to provide food for the young birds. They thanked  him heartily, and said, \"If ever you should be in distress, call to us  and we will help you at once.\"    After this George was obliged to travel on foot, and he walked on for  a long time, ever getting further and further into the forest. On  reaching the end of it, he saw stretching before him an immense sea  that seemed to mingle with the horizon. Close by stood two men  disputing the possession of a large fish with golden scales that had  fallen into their net.    \"The net belongs to me,\" said one, \"therefore the fish must be mine.\"    \"Your net would not have been of the slightest use, for it would have  been lost in the sea, had I not come with my boat just in the nick of  time.\"    \"Well, you shall have the next haul I make.\"    \"And suppose you should catch nothing? No; give me this one and keep  the next haul for yourself.\"    \"I am going to put an end to your quarrel,\" said George, addressing  them. \"Sell me the fish: I will pay you well, and you can divide the  money between you.\"    Thereupon he put into their hands all the money the king had given him  for the journey, without keeping a single coin for himself. The  fishermen rejoiced at the good fortune which had befallen them, but  George put the fish back into the water. The fish, thankful for this  unexpected freedom, dived and disappeared, but returning to the  surface, said, \"Whenever you may need my help you have but to call me,  I shall not fail to show my gratitude.\"    \"Where are you going?\" asked the fisherman.    \"I am in search of a wife for my old master; she is known as the Maid  with the Golden Locks: but I am at a loss where to find her.\"    [Illustration]    \"If that be all, we can easily give you information,\" answered they.  \"She is Princess Zlato Vlaska, and daughter of the king whose crystal  palace is built on that island yonder. The golden light from the  princess's hair is reflected on sea and sky every morning when she  combs it. If you would like to go to the island we will take you there  for nothing, in return for the clever and generous way by which you  made us stop quarrelling. But beware of one thing: when in the palace  do not make a mistake as to which is the princess, for there are  twelve of them, but only Zlato Vlaska has hair of gold.\"    When George reached the island he lost no time in making his way to  the palace, and demanded from the king the hand of his daughter,  Princess Zlato Vlaska, in marriage to the king his master.    \"I will grant the request with pleasure,\" said his majesty, \"but only  on one condition, namely, that you perform certain tasks which I will  set you. These will be three in number, and must be done in three  days, just as I order you. For the present you had better rest and  refresh yourself after your journey.\"    On the next day the king said, \"My daughter, the Maid with the Golden  Hair, had a string of fine pearls, and the thread having broken, the  pearls were scattered far and wide among the long grass of this field.  Go and pick up every one of the pearls, for they must all be found.\"    George went into the meadow, which was of great length and stretched  away far out of sight. He went down on his knees and hunted between  the tufts of grass and bramble from morning until noon, but not a  single pearl could he find.    \"Ah, if I only had my good little ants here,\" he cried, \"they would be  able to help me.\"    \"Here we are, young man, at your service,\" answered the ants, suddenly  appearing. Then they all ran round him, crying out, \"What is the  matter? What do you want?\"    \"I have to find all the pearls lost in this field, and cannot see a  single one: can you help me?\"    \"Wait a little, we will soon get them for you.\"    He had not to wait very long, for they brought him a heap of pearls,  and all he had to do was to thread them on the string. Just as he was  about to make a knot he saw a lame ant coming slowly towards him, for  one of her feet had been burned in the bush fire.    \"Wait a moment, George,\" she called out; \"do not tie the knot before  threading this last pearl I am bringing you.\"    When George took his pearls to the king, his majesty first counted  them to make sure they were all there, and then said, \"You have done  very well in this test, to-morrow I will give you another.\"    Early next morning the king summoned George to him and said, \"My  daughter, the Princess with the Golden Hair, dropped her gold ring  into the sea while bathing. You must find the jewel and bring it me  to-day.\"    The young fellow walked thoughtfully up and down the beach. The water  was pure and transparent, but he could not see beyond a certain  distance into its depths, and therefore could not tell where the ring  was lying beneath the water.    \"Ah, my golden fishling, why are you not here now? You would surely be  able to help me,\" he said to himself, speaking aloud.    \"Here I am,\" answered the fish's voice from the sea, \"what can I do  for you?\"    \"I have to find a gold ring which has been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#8)"],[1,"  nature of any mechanical contrivance. They will learn which way a door  opens, and rarely if ever do they undiscerningly close it when it is  slightly ajar and they wish to pass through the opening; but I have  never been able to observe or obtain evidence to show that they would  without teaching pull down a latch in the way in which a cat readily  learns to do. Much as dogs have had to do with guns, they display no  kind of interest in the arms except so far as they are tokens of sport  to come. They connect the explosion with the capture of game, and will  search for it in the direction toward which the barrel was pointed. I  have not, however, been able to find that they know, as they might  readily do, and as a crow would surely do, when the weapon was loaded  and when empty. They show no interest in it, such as monkeys readily  display toward any mechanical contrivance to which their attention has  been directed. All these negative features indicate that the mechanical  side of the canine mind is entirely undeveloped.    [Illustration: Collie]    Although there is some evidence that the sense of number attains a  measure of development in dogs, the ability to form mathematical  conceptions of any kind appears to be very weak in this species. The  fact that shepherd-dogs, in a way, keep an account of considerable  flocks so that they will know when one is gone astray, can readily be  explained on the supposition that they know their charges individually  and not in sum. The absence of arithmetical capacity is, however, less  important than the lack of mechanical sense, for the reason that such  incapacity is also common in the lowest races of men. Although dogs, as  before noted, quickly and clearly acquire a notion of property rights in  all which pertains to their owner's holdings, they appear never to  extend their sense of their own personal possessions beyond the original  limit to which they had attained when the species was domesticated. The  creature feels a sense of personal property in his food and in his  sleeping-place, but appears not to extend his conception of individual  rights beyond these primitively established limits.    All our well-bred household dogs quickly learn certain bodily habits  which are necessary to make them acceptable members of a household.  These habits are not well affirmed by inherited instinct, but the ease  with which the instruction is acquired shows that they have become prone  to submit to such regulations. Culture on this line rests upon a primal  instinct, originating we know not how, which leads a number of wild  animals to conceal their excrement. On the other hand, these creatures  exhibit no sense of modesty, though that, in a more or less complete  measure, is characteristic of all human tribes whatsoever.    As regards the memory, dogs appear to have a considerably greater  measure of capacity than is observable in any other group of  domesticated animals. There is no question that they can recall their  associations with people from whom they have been separated for a year  or more. Some trustworthy anecdotes appear to establish the fact that  the recollections may endure for two or three years. I have observed  an instance in which the memory seems perfectly clear after an  interval of eighteen months, and this concerned a person who had been  with the dog for a period of not more than four days. It is  interesting to note the behavior of a dog when he has failed to  recognize a person whom he has known well, but from whom he has been  long separated. I have a shepherd-dog that has known me well, but the  friendship is often interrupted by partings of some months' duration.  When, after one of these absences, I appear to him in the distance, he  comes furiously towards me, quite possessed by his enmity. At a certain  point in his charge a doubt begins to beset him; he moderates his pace;  his roaring bark passes into a whine; and as the full measure of his  blunder is borne in upon him by my voice, he becomes the picture of  shame. In his perplexity, he always finds relief in endeavoring with  his paw to scrape a supposititious fly from the side of his nose. He  then deals with what I suppose to be an equally imaginary flea; after  he has thus gained a few seconds for readjustment, he welcomes me  joyously. All this is so thoroughly human-like, that even the  naturalist, the professional doubter, is forced to believe that the  dog's mind works substantially as his own, and that the feelings  connected with the action are essentially the same.    While in the case of the elephant and the pig, and in a less measure  in several other of the lower animals, we have indices of as high or  even higher intelligence than the dog, no other brute shows anything  like the same measure of what we may term human quality. So far as the  field of the emotions is concerned, we are driven to believe that it  has been bred into the kind by the ages of intimate associations,  supported by the selective process which has led people to preserve  the individual of the species with which they found themselves the  most in sympathy. I repeat the suggestion, and shall repeat it yet  again, for the reason that just here--how effectively the reader's  imagination will suggest--we find a basis for the hope that, with  time and care, man may bring his subjects of the lower realm into a  more intimate, affectionate, and helpful relation than is dreamed of  by those who look upon them as mere brutes.    The most curious limitation which we find in dogs is as to the measure  of expression to which they have attained. No one who has well  considered the facts can doubt that our civilized varieties of this  species have something like a hundred times as much which deserves  utterance as their savage forefathers possessed. Yet the capacity for  giving note to these thoughts or emotions has not gained anything like  the proportion to the needs. It seems, however, that some gain in this  direction has been made, and that much may be won hereafter in the way  of further advance. Never having known the species whence our dogs came  in its wild state, we are uncertain as to its modes of expression; but,  observing the varieties of dogs which are kept by savages, it seems  probable that the primitive canines used their voice only in howling or  yelping; that is, as a continuous sound akin to the bellowings or other  cries of the various wild mammals. It is characteristic of all these  primitive forms of utterance that they are, to a great extent,  involuntary, and that when the outcry is begun it continues in a  mechanical manner, with no trace of modulation arising from the  conditions of the moment. In other words, these actions resemble, in a  way, sneezing or hiccoughing in human kind; actions which are  stimulated by certain states of the body, but which are not at all  under the control of the will. Howling or bellowing doubtless  represents, in a measure, a state of mind as well as of body, but the  action is of a general and uncontrolled kind.    The effect of advancing culture upon a dog has been gradually to  decrease this ancient undifferentiated mode of expression afforded by  howling and yelping, and to replace it by the much more speech-like  bark. There is some doubt whether the dogs possessed by savages have the  power of uttering the sharp, specialized note which is so characteristic  of the civilized forms of their species. It is clear, however, that if  they have the capacity of thus expressing themselves, they use it but  rarely. On the other hand, our high-bred dogs have, to a great extent,  lost the habit of expressing themselves in the ancient way. Many of our  breeds appear to have become incapable of ululating. There is no doubt  but this change in the mode of expression greatly increases the capacity  of our dogs to set forth their states of mind. If we watch a high-bred  dog, one with a wide range of sensibilities, which we may find in breeds  which have long been closely associated with man, we may readily note  five or six varieties of sound in the bark, each of which is clearly  related to a certain state of mind. The bark of welcome, of fear, of  rage, of doubt, and of pure fun, are almost always perfectly distinct to  the educated ear, and this although the observer may not be acquainted  with the creature; if he knows him well, he may be able to distinguish  various other intonations--those which express impatience and even an  element of sorrow. This last note verges toward the howl.    It does not seem to me that we should regard barking as a new and  useful invention; there are, indeed, few such in the organic world. The  sound appears to me to have been derived from the primitive habit of  howling. If we hearken to this utterance we perceive that it is not an  unbroken sound, but is somewhat intermittent. At either end of the  prolonged sound we can often notice that it is divided into rather  distinct yelps more or less completely separated from the other notes.  The cries of a dog when beaten often exhibit the same peculiarity; so,  too, the puppy, before he has attained skill in barking, will often  prolong each utterance in a way which makes its relation to the ancient  mode of expression tolerably clear. At the risk of being deemed  fanciful, I venture to suggest that the bark is in effect a division  of the howl into clearly separated notes, the change having come about  as a similar alteration is effected in our own speech, by the increase  in the intelligence which the creature is called upon to express. I  conceive that while the primitive and massive emotions found  satisfying utterance in the long-drawn notes, the more divided state  of mind of the humanized successor has led to a change in its  utterances. Although these modifications of speech, if such we may  term them, have probably been developed on the basis of the dog's  human"]]]
