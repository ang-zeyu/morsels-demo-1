She spoke of, generosity, of mercy; he listened as if touched  and wavering, until she named the Suliots. Then, filled with fury, he  seized a pistol and fired at her. She was not hurt, but fell to the  ground overcome with terror, and her women hastily intervened and  carried her away. For the first time in his life, perhaps, Ali shuddered  before the dread of a murder.    It was his wife, the mother of his children, whom he saw lying at his  feet, and the recollection afflicted and tormented him. He rose in the  night and went to Emineh's apartment; he knocked and called, but being  refused admittance, in his anger he broke open the door. Terrified by  the noise; and at the sight of her infuriated husband, Emineh fell into  violent convulsions, and shortly expired. Thus perished the daughter of  Capelan Pacha, wife of Ali Tepeleni, and mother of Mouktar and Veli,  who, doomed to live surrounded by evil, yet remained virtuous and good.    Her death caused universal mourning throughout Albania, and produced a  not less deep impression on the mind of her murderer. Emineh's spectre  pursued him in his pleasures, in the council chamber, in the hours of  night. He saw her, he heard her, and would awake, exclaiming, \"my wife!  my wife!--It is my wife!--Her eyes are angry; she threatens me!--Save  me! Mercy!\" For more than ten years Ali never dared to sleep alone.          CHAPTER IV      In December, the Suliots, decimated by battle, worn by famine,  discouraged by treachery, were obliged to capitulate. The treaty gave  them leave to go where they would, their own mountains excepted. The  unfortunate tribe divided into two parts, the one going towards Parga,  the other towards Prevesa. Ali gave orders for the destruction of both,  notwithstanding the treaty.    The Parga division was attacked in its march, and charged by a numerous  body of Skipetars. Its destruction seemed imminent, but instinct  suddenly revealed to the ignorant mountaineers the one manoeuvre which  might save them. They formed a square, placing old men, women, children,  and cattle in the midst, and, protected by this military formation,  entered Parga in full view of the cut-throats sent to pursue them.    Less fortunate was the Prevesa division, which, terrified by a sudden  and unexpected attack, fled in disorder to a Greek convent called  Zalongos. But the gate was soon broken down, and the unhappy Suliots  massacred to the last man.    The women, whose tents had been pitched on the summit of a lofty rock,  beheld the terrible carnage which destroyed their defenders. Henceforth  their only prospect was that of becoming the slaves of those who had  just slaughtered their husbands and brothers. An heroic resolution  spared them this infamy; they joined hands, and chanting their national  songs, moved in a solemn dance round the rocky platform. As the song  ended, they uttered a prolonged and piercing cry, and cast themselves  and their children down into the profound abyss beneath.    There were still some Suliots left in their country when Ali Pacha took  possession of it. These were all taken and brought to Janina, and their  sufferings were the first adornments of the festival made for the army.  Every soldier's imagination was racked for the discovery of new  tortures, and the most original among them had the privilege of  themselves carrying out their inventions.    There were some who, having had their noses and ears cut off, were  compelled to eat them raw, dressed as a salad. One young man was scalped  until the skin fell back upon his shoulders, then beaten round the court  of the seraglio for the pacha's entertainment, until at length a lance  was run through his body and he was cast on the funeral pile. Many were  boiled alive and their flesh then thrown to the dogs.    From this time the Cross has disappeared from the Selleid mountains, and  the gentle prayer of Christ no longer wakes the echoes of Suli.    During the course of this war, and shortly after the death of Emineh,  another dismal drama was enacted in the pacha's family, whose active  wickedness nothing seemed to weary. The scandalous libertinism of both  father and sons had corrupted all around as well as themselves. This  demoralisation brought bitter fruits for all alike: the subjects endured  a terrible tyranny; the masters sowed among themselves distrust,  discord, and hatred. The father wounded his two sons by turns in their  tenderest affections, and the sons avenged themselves by abandoning  their father in the hour of danger.    There was in Janina a woman named Euphrosyne, a niece of the archbishop,  married to one of the richest Greek merchants, and noted for wit and  beauty. She was already the mother of two children, when Mouktar became  enamoured of her, and ordered her to come to his palace. The unhappy  Euphrosyne, at once guessing his object, summoned a family council to  decide what should be done. All agreed that there was no escape, and  that her husband's life was in danger, on account of the jealousy of his  terrible rival. He fled the city that same night, and his wife  surrendered herself to Mouktar, who, softened by her charms, soon  sincerely loved her, and overwhelmed her with presents and favours.  Things were in this position when Mouktar was obliged to depart on an  important expedition.    Scarcely had he started before his wives complained to Ali that  Euphrosyne usurped their rights and caused their husband to neglect  them. Ali, who complained greatly of his sons' extravagance, and  regretted the money they squandered, at once struck a blow which was  both to enrich himself and increase the terror of his name.    One night he appeared by torchlight, accompanied by his guards, at  Euphrosyne's house. Knowing his cruelty and avarice, she sought to  disarm one by gratifying the other: she collected her money and jewels  and laid them at Ali's feet with a look of supplication.    \"These things are only my own property, which you restore,\" said he,  taking possession of the rich offering. \"Can you give back the heart of  Mouktar, which you have stolen?\"    Euphrosyne besought him by his paternal feelings, for the sake of his  son whose love had been her misfortune and was now her only crime, to  spare a mother whose conduct had been otherwise irreproachable. But her  tears and pleadings produced no effect on Ali, who ordered her to be  taken, loaded with fetters and covered with a piece of sackcloth, to the  prison of the seraglio.    If it were certain that there was no hope for the unhappy Euphrosyne,  one trusted that she might at least be the only victim. But Ali,  professing to follow the advice of some severe reformers who wished to  restore decent morality, arrested at the same time fifteen ladies  belonging to the best Christian families in Janina. A Wallachian, named  Nicholas Janco, took the opportunity to denounce his own wife, who was  on the point of becoming a mother, as guilty of adultery, and handed her  also over to the pacha. These unfortunate women were brought before Ali  to undergo a trial of which a sentence of death was the foregone  conclusion. They were then confined in a dungeon, where they spent two  days of misery. The third night, the executioners appeared to conduct  them to the lake where they were to perish. Euphrosyne, too exhausted to  endure to the end, expired by the way, and when she was flung with the  rest into the dark waters, her soul had already escaped from its earthly  tenement. Her body was found the next day, and was buried in the  cemetery of the monastery of Saints-Anargyres, where her tomb, covered  with white iris and sheltered by a wild olive tree, is yet shown.    Mouktar was returning from his expedition when a courier from his  brother Veli brought him a letter informing him of these events. He  opened it. \"Euphrosyne!\" he cried, and, seizing one of his pistols,  fired it at the messenger, who fell dead at his feet,--\"Euphrosyne,  behold thy first victim!\" Springing on his horse, he galloped towards  Janina. His guards followed at a distance, and the inhabitants of all  the villages he passed fled at his approach. He paid no attention to  them, but rode till his horse fell dead by the lake which had engulfed  Euphrosyne, and then, taking a boat, he went to hide his grief and rage  in his own palace.    Ali, caring little for passion which evaporated in tears and cries, sent  an order to Mouktar to appear before him at once. \"He will not kill  you,\" he remarked to his messenger, with a bitter smile. And, in fact,  the man who a moment before was furiously raging and storming against  his father, as if overwhelmed by this imperious message, calmed down,  and obeyed.    \"Come hither, Mouktar,\" said the pacha, extending his murderous hand to  be kissed as soon as his son appeared. \"I shall take no notice of your  anger, but in future never forget that a man who braves public opinion  as I do fears nothing in the world. You can go now; when your troops  have rested from their march, you can come and ask for orders. Go,  remember what I have said.\"    Mouktar retired as submissively as if he had just received pardon for  some serious crime, and found no better consolation than to spend the  night with Veli in drinking and debauchery. But a day was to come when  the brothers, alike outraged by their father, would plot and carry out a  terrible vengeance.    However, the Porte began to take umbrage at the continual aggrandisement  of the Pacha of Janina. Not daring openly to attack so formidable a  vassal, the sultan sought by underhand means to diminish his power, and  under the pretext that Ali was becoming too old for the labour of so  many offices, the government of Thessaly was withdrawn from him, but, to  show that this was not done in enmity, the province was entrusted to his  nephew, Elmas Bey, son of Suleiman and Chainitza.    Chainitza, fully as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#8)"],[1,"the people supposed to be the  child's father, but who Pigoreau assured them was her brother-in-law,  often came to see him.    When the child was eighteen months old, la Pigoreau took him away and  weaned him. Of the two by her husband the elder was called Antoine, the  second would have been called Henri if he had lived; but he was born on  the 9th of August 1639, after the death of his father, who was killed in  June of the same year, and died shortly after his birth. La Pigoreau  thought fit to give the name and condition of this second son to the  stranger, and thus bury for ever the secret of his birth. With this end  in view, she left the quarter where she lived, and removed to conceal  herself in another parish where she was not known. The child was brought  up under the name and style of Henri, second son of la Pigoreau, till he  was two and a half years of age; but at this time, whether she was not  engaged to keep it any longer, or whether she had spent the two thousand  livres deposited with the grocer Raguenet, and could get no more from  the principals, she determined to get rid of it.    Her gossips used to tell this woman that she cared but little for her  eldest son, because she was very confident of the second one making his  fortune, and that if she were obliged to give up one of them, she had  better keep the younger, who was a beautiful boy. To this she would  reply that the matter did not depend upon her; that the boy's godfather  was an uncle in good circumstances, who would not charge himself with  any other child. She often mentioned this uncle, her brother-in-law, she  said, who was major-domo in a great house.    One morning, the hall porter at the hotel de Saint-Geran came to Baulieu  and told him that a woman carrying a child was asking for him at the  wicket gate; this Baulieu was, in fact, the brother of the fencing  master, and godfather to Pigoreau's second son. It is now supposed that  he was the unknown person who had placed the child of quality with her,  and who used to go and see him at his nurse's. La Pigoreau gave him a  long account of her situation. The major-domo took the child with some  emotion, and told la Pigoreau to wait his answer a short distance off,  in a place which he pointed out.    Baulieu's wife made a great outcry at the first proposal of an increase  of family; but he succeeded in pacifying her by pointing out the  necessities of his sister-in-law, and how easy and inexpensive it was to  do this good work in such a house as the count's. He went to his master  and mistress to ask permission to bring up this child in their hotel; a  kind of feeling entered into the charge he was undertaking which in some  measure lessened the weight on his conscience.    The count and countess at first opposed this project; telling him that  having already five children he ought not to burden himself with any  more, but he petitioned so earnestly that he obtained what he wanted.  The countess wished to see it, and as she was about to start for Moulins  she ordered it to be put in her women's coach; when it was shown her,  she cried out, \"What a lovely child!\" The boy was fair, with large blue  eyes and very regular features, She gave him a hundred caresses, which  the child returned very prettily. She at once took a great fancy to him,  and said to Baulieu, \"I shall not put him in my women's coach; I shall  put him in my own.\"    After they arrived at the chateau of Saint-Geran, her affection for  Henri, the name retained by the child, increased day by day. She often  contemplated him with sadness, then embraced him with tenderness, and  kept him long on her bosom. The count shared this affection for the  supposed nephew of Baulieu, who was adopted, so to speak, and brought up  like a child of quality.    The Marquis de Saint-Maixent and Madame de Bouille had not married,  although the old Marquis de Bouille had long been dead. It appeared that  they had given up this scheme. The marchioness no doubt felt scruples  about it, and the marquis was deterred from marriage by his profligate  habits. It is moreover supposed that other engagements and heavy bribes  compensated the loss he derived from the marchioness's breach of faith.    He was a man about town at that period, and was making love to the  demoiselle Jacqueline de la Garde; he had succeeded in gaining her  affections, and brought matters to such a point that she no longer  refused her favours except on the grounds of her pregnancy and the  danger of an indiscretion. The marquis then offered to introduce to her  a matron who could deliver women without the pangs of labour, and who  had a very successful practice. The same Jacqueline de la Garde further  gave evidence at the trial that M. de Saint-Maixent had often boasted,  as of a scientific intrigue, of having spirited away the son of a  governor of a province and grandson of a marshal of France; that he  spoke of the Marchioness de Bouille, said that he had made her rich, and  that it was to him she owed her great wealth; and further, that one day  having taken her to a pretty country seat which belonged to him, she  praised its beauty, saying \"c'etait un beau lieu\"; he replied by a pun  on a man's name, saying that he knew another Baulieu who had enabled him  to make a fortune of five hundred thousand crowns. He also said to  Jadelon, sieur de la Barbesange, when posting with him from Paris, that  the Countess de Saint-Geran had been delivered of a son who was in his  power.    The marquis had not seen Madame de Bouille for a long time; a common  danger reunited them. They had both learned with terror the presence of  Henri at the hotel de Saint-Geran. They consulted about this; the  marquis undertook to cut the danger short. However, he dared put in  practice nothing overtly against the child, a matter still more  difficult just then, inasmuch as some particulars of his discreditable  adventures had leaked out, and the Saint-Geran family received him more  than coldly.    Baulieu, who witnessed every day the tenderness of the count and  countess for the boy Henri, had been a hundred times on the point of  giving himself up and confessing everything. He was torn to pieces with  remorse. Remarks escaped him which he thought he might make without  ulterior consequences; seeing the lapse of time, but they were noted and  commented on. Sometimes he would say that he held in his hand the life  and honour of Madame the Marchioness de Bouille; sometimes that the  count and countess had more reasons than they knew of for loving Henri.  One day he put a case of conscience to a confessor, thus: \"Whether a man  who had been concerned in the abduction of a child could not satisfy his  conscience by restoring him to his father and mother without telling  them who he was?\" What answer the confessor made is not known, but  apparently it was not what the major-domo wanted. He replied to a  magistrate of Moulins, who congratulated him on having a nephew whom his  masters overburdened with kind treatment, that they ought to love him,  since he was nearly related to them.    These remarks were noticed by others than those principally concerned.  One day a wine merchant came to propose to Baulieu the purchase of a  pipe of Spanish wine, of which he gave him a sample bottle; in the  evening he was taken violently ill. They carried him to bed, where he  writhed, uttering horrible cries. One sole thought possessed him when  his sufferings left him a lucid interval, and in his agony he repeated  over and over again that he wished to implore pardon from the count and  countess for a great injury which he had done them. The people round  about him told him that was a trifle, and that he ought not to let it  embitter his last moments, but he begged so piteously that he got them  to promise that they should be sent for.    The count thought it was some trifling irregularity, some  misappropriation in the house accounts; and fearing to hasten the death  of the sufferer by the shame of the confession of a fault, he sent word  that he heartily forgave him, that he might die tranquil, and refused to  see him. Baulieu expired, taking his secret with him. This happened in  1648.    The child was then seven years old. His charming manners grew with his  age, and the count and countess felt their love for him increase. They  caused him to be taught dancing and fencing, put him into breeches and  hose, and a page's suit of their livery, in which capacity he served  them. The marquis turned his attack to this quarter. He was doubtless  preparing some plot as criminal as the preceding, when justice overtook  him for some other great crimes of which he had been guilty. He was  arrested one day in the street when conversing with one of the  Saint-Geran footmen, and taken to the Conciergerie of the Palace of  Justice.    Whether owing to these occurrences, or to grounds for suspicion before  mentioned, certain reports spread in the Bourbonnais embodying some of  the real facts; portions of them reached the ears of the count and  countess, but they had only the effect of renewing their grief without  furnishing a clue to the truth.    Meanwhile, the count went to take the waters at Vichy. The countess and  Madame de Bouille followed him, and there they chanced to encounter  Louise Goillard, the midwife. This woman renewed her acquaintance with  the house, and in particular often visited the Marchioness de Bouille.  One day the countess, unexpectedly entering the marchioness's room,  found them both conversing in an undertone. They stopped talking  immediately, and appeared disconcerted.    The countess noticed this without attaching any importance to it, and  asked the subject of their conversation.    \"Oh, nothing,\" said the marchioness.    \"But what is it?\" insisted the countess, seeing that she blushed.    The marchioness, no longer able to evade the question, and feeling her  difficulties"]]]
