It is a single index that summarizes the age  distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a  low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the  importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of  goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships),  which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.  This  entry contains information in four fields - total, ships by type,  foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.            Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total  DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those ships.  DWT or dead weight  tonnage is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that  a ship can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line.  GRT or  gross register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire  sheltered volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers and  converting it to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is  no stable relationship between GRT and DWT.           Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo  ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers,  combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers,  livestock carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum  tankers, passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers,  refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea  passenger ships, specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.           Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but  belong to owners in another.           Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners  in one country but fly the flag of another.    Military  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military branches  This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other  defense or security forces.    Military expenditures - dollar figure  This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the  figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in  percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an  exchange rate basis, not purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.  Dollar  figures for military expenditures should be treated with caution  because of different price patterns and accounting methods among  nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their  currencies.    Military expenditures - percent of GDP  This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent  of gross domestic product (GDP).    Military manpower - availability  This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and  assumes that every individual is fit to serve.    Military manpower - fit for military service  This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for  military service. This is a more refined measure of potential military  manpower availability which tries to account for the health situation  in the country and reduces the maximum potential number to a more  realistic estimate of the actual number fit to serve.    Military manpower - military age  This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer  for military service or be subject to conscription.    Military manpower - reaching military age annually  This entry gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the  military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the  availability of draft-age young adults.    Military - note  This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance  not included elsewhere.    Money figures  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.    National holiday  This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.    Nationality  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.    Natural gas - production  This entry is the total natural gas produced in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission  of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - consumption  This entry is the total natural gas consumed in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission  of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - exports  This entry is the total natural gas exported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - imports  This entry is the total natural gas imported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - proved reserves  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic  meters (cu m).   Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas,  which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated  with a high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a  given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    Natural hazards  This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other  resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate  This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of  persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as  net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall  level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems  such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people  are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain  key sectors (if people are leaving).    Oil - production  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per day (bbl/day).  The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - consumption  This entry is the total oil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#8)"],[1,"be put an end to in a bowl of soup.    The girl Edme Huet, a woman of Brescia, deposed that Sainte-Croix went  to see the marquise every day, and that in a box belonging to that lady  she had seen two little packets containing sublimate in powder and in  paste: she recognised these, because she was an apothecary's daughter.  She added that one day Madame de Brinvilliers, after a dinner party, in  a merry mood, said, showing her a little box, \"Here is vengeance on  one's enemies: this box is small, but holds plenty of successsions!\"  That she gave back the box into her hands, but soon changing from her  sprightly mood, she cried, \"Good heavens, what have I said? Tell  nobody.\" That Lambert, clerk at the palace, told her he had brought the  packets to Madame from Sainte-Croix; that Lachaussee often went to see  her; and that she herself, not being paid ten pistoles which the  marquise owed her, went to complain to Sainte-Croix, threatening to tell  the lieutenant what she had seen; and accordingly the ten pistoles were  paid; further, that the marquise and Sainte-Croix always kept poison  about them, to make use of, in case of being arrested.    Laurent Perrette, living with Glazer, said that he had often seen a lady  call on his mistress with Sainte-Croix; that the footman told him she  was the Marquise de Brinvilliers; that he would wager his head on it  that they came to Glazer's to make poison; that when they came they used  to leave their carriage at the Foire Saint-Germain.    Marie de Villeray, maid to the marquise, deposed that after the death of  M. d'Aubray the councillor, Lachaussee came to see the lady and spoke  with her in private; that Briancourt said she had caused the death of a  worthy men; that Briancourt every day took some electuary for fear of  being poisoned, and it was no doubt due to this precaution that he was  still alive; but he feared he would be stabbed, because she had told him  the secret about the poisoning; that d'Aubray's daughter had to be  warned; and that there was a similar design against the tutor of M. de  Brinvillier's children. Marie de Villeray added that two days after the  death of the councillor, when Lachaussee was in Madame's bedroom,  Couste, the late lieutenant's secretary, was announced, and Lachaussee  had to be hidden in the alcove by the bed. Lachaussee brought the  marquise a letter from Sainte-Croix.    Francois Desgrais, officer, deposed that when he was given the king's  orders he arrested the marquise at Liege; that he found under her bed a  box which he sealed; that the lady had demanded a paper which was in it,  containing her confession, but he refused it; that on the road to Paris  the marquise had told him that she believed it was Glazer who made the  poisons for Sainte-Croix; that Sainte-Croix, who had made a rendezvous  with her one day at the cross Saint-Honore, there showed her four little  bottles, saying, \"See what Glazer has sent me.\" She asked him for one,  but Sainte-Croix said he would rather die than give it up. He added that  the archer Antoine Barbier had given him three letters written by the  marquise to Theria; that in the first she had told him to come at once  and snatch her from the hands of the soldiers; that in the second she  said that the escort was only composed of eight persons, who could he  worsted by five men; that in the third she said that if he could not  save her from the men who were taking her away, he should at least  approach the commissary, and killing his valet's horse and two other  horses in his carriage, then take the box, and burn it; otherwise she  was lost.    Laviolette, an archer, deposed that on the evening of the arrest, the  marquise had a long pin and tried to put it in her mouth; that he  stopped her, and told her that she was very wicked; that he perceived  that people said the truth and that she had poisoned all her family; to  which she replied, that if she had, it was only through following bad  advice, and that one could not always be good.    Antoine Barbier, an archer, said that the marquise at table took up a  glass as though to drink, and tried to swallow a piece of it; that he  prevented this, and she promised to make his fortune if only he would  save her; that she wrote several letters to Theria; that during the  whole journey she tried all she could to swallow pins, bits of glass,  and earth; that she had proposed that he should cut Desgrais' throat,  and kill the commissary's valet; that she had bidden him get the box and  burn it, and bring a lighted torch to burn everything; that she had  written to Penautier from the Conciergerie; that she gave him, the  letter, and he pretended to deliver it.    Finally, Francoise Roussel deposed that she had been in the service of  the marquise, and the lady had one day given her some preserved  gooseberries; that she had eaten some on the point of her knife, and at  once felt ill. She also gave her a slice of mutton, rather wet, which  she ate, afterwards suffering great pain in the stomach, feeling as  though she had been pricked in the heart, and for three years had felt  the same, believing herself poisoned.    It was difficult to continue a system of absolute denial in face of  proofs like these. The marquise persisted, all the same, that she was in  no way guilty; and Maitre Nivelle, one of the best lawyers of the  period, consented to defend her cause.    He combated one charge after another, in a remarkably clever way, owning  to the adulterous connection of the marquise with Sainte-Croix, but  denying her participation in the murders of the d'Aubrays, father and  sons: these he ascribed entirely to the vengeance desired by  Sainte-Croix. As to the confession, the strongest and, he maintained,  the only evidence against Madame de Brinvilliers, he attacked its  validity by bringing forward certain similar cases, where the evidence  supplied by the accused against themselves had not been admitted by  reason of the legal action: 'Non auditur perire volens'. He cited three  instances, and as they are themselves interesting, we copy them verbatim  from his notes.    FIRST CASE    Dominicus Soto, a very famous canonist and theologian, confessor to  Charles V, present at the first meetings of the Council of Trent under  Paul III, propounds a question about a man who had lost a paper on which  he had written down his sins. It happened that this paper fell into the  hands of an ecclesiastical judge, who wished to put in information  against the writer on the strength of this document. Now this judge was  justly punished by his superior, because confession is so sacred that  even that which is destined to constitute the confession should be  wrapped in eternal silence. In accordance with this precedent, the  following judgment, reported in the 'Traite des Confesseurs', was given  by Roderic Acugno. A Catalonian, native of Barcelona, who was condemned  to death for homicide and owned his guilt, refused to confess when the  hour of punishment arrived. However strongly pressed, he resisted, and  so violently, giving no reason, that all were persuaded that his mind  was unhinged by the fear of death. Saint-Thomas of Villeneuve,  Archbishop of Valencia, heard of his obstinacy. Valencia was the place  where his sentence was given. The worthy prelate was so charitable as to  try to persuade the criminal to make his confession, so as not to lose  his soul as well as his body. Great was his surprise, when he asked the  reason of the refusal, to hear the doomed man declare that he hated  confessors, because he had been condemned through the treachery of his  own priest, who was the only person who knew about the murder. In  confession he had admitted his crime and said where the body was buried,  and all about it; his confessor had revealed it all, and he could not  deny it, and so he had been condemned. He had only just learned, what he  did not know at the time he confessed, that his confessor was the  brother of the man he had killed, and that the desire for vengeance had  prompted the bad priest to betray his confession. Saint-Thomas, hearing  this, thought that this incident was of more importance than the trial,  which concerned the life of only one person, whereas the honour of  religion was at stake, with consequences infinitely more important. He  felt he must verify this statement, and summoned the confessor. When he  had admitted the breach of faith, the judges were obliged to revoke  their sentence and pardon the criminal, much to the gratification of the  public mind. The confessor was adjudged a very severe penance, which  Saint-Thomas modified because of his prompt avowal of his fault, and  still more because he had given an opportunity for the public exhibition  of that reverence which judges themselves are bound to pay to  confessions.    SECOND CASE    In 1579 an innkeeper at Toulouse killed with his own hand, unknown to  the inmates of his house, a stranger who had come to lodge with him, and  buried him secretly in the cellar. The wretch then suffered from  remorse, and confessed the crime with all its circumstances, telling his  confessor where the body was buried. The relations of the dead man,  after making all possible search to get news of him, at last proclaimed  through the town a large reward to be given to anyone who would discover  what had happened to him. The confessor, tempted by this bait, secretly  gave word that they had only to search in the innkeeper's cellar and  they would find the corpse. And they found it in the place indicated.  The innkeeper was thrown into prison, was tortured, and confessed his  crime. But afterwards he always maintained that his confessor was the  only person who could have betrayed him. Then the Parliament, indignant  with such means of finding out the truth, declared him innocent, failing  other proof than what came through his confessor. The confessor was  himself condemned to be"]]]
