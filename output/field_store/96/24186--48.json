(Volume 1 of 2) (#8)"],[1,"their family--New Zealand families run large, by the  way--multiplies and grows up round them, they are able to enjoy the  comforts of a competence they could never have attained at home. Some  settlers, who originally came out, man and wife, as government  immigrants drawn from the peasant class, are now wealthy proprietors of  broad acres, flocks, and herds; and are able to send their sons to  college and their daughters to finishing-schools; the whilom humble  servant girl now riding in her carriage, and wearing silk and satin if  she list. Such are the rewards that may tempt the peasant here.  Difficulties there are in plenty, but they lessen year by year; while  comfort and competence are certain in the end, and wealth even is  possible to the industrious.    Occasionally it happens that among a body of immigrants are one or two  who are decidedly unsuitable. There is an example among our particular  ship-load. Here is a woman, purblind, decrepit, looking sixty years old  at least, and, by some incomprehensible series of mistakes, she has  found her way out here as a \"single girl!\" What was the Agent-General in  London about, and what could the Dispatching Officer have been thinking  of, when they let this ancient cripple pass them? Yet here she is, a  \"single girl\" in immigrant parlance; and work she must get somehow and  somewhere, for there are no poorhouses or paupers here as yet. But even  she, useless to all seeming as she is, and unable to bear her part in  the energetic industry of a new country, will find her billet. A  good-natured farmer takes her off, judging that she may earn her keep in  his kitchen, and if not--well! he is prosperous, and should be generous  too. And so old granny toddles away amid the friendly laughter of the  crowd, satisfied enough to find there is a niche even for her in our  Canaan.    The great question that of late years has been continually asked of old  colonials in England is, what are the prospects afforded by New Zealand  to men of the middle classes? The answer is usually unfavourable,  simply because many colonials cannot disassociate the idea of a  gentleman adventurer from that of a scapegrace or ne'er-do-well.  Secondly, they look at the questioner's present condition; and never  take into consideration the power he may have of adapting himself to  totally different circumstances. I think this view admits of  considerable enlargement, and my experience has led me to believe that  many a man, who struggles through life in the old country in some  exacting and ill-paid sedentary occupation, might have been benefited by  emigration. The colonies have been inundated with ruined spendthrifts,  gamblers, drunkards, idle good-for-nothings, who have been induced to  emigrate in the belief that that alone was a panacea for their moral  diseases. Very very few of them have reformed or done any good, so that  colonists are naturally prejudiced against their class, and look upon  gentleman-new-chums with great suspicion. Again, some go out who are too  delicate or sensitive to stand the roughnesses they are bound to  undergo, and these break down in their apprenticeship the first year or  two, and, if they can, go home again to speak evil of the colony ever  afterwards.    One thing is certain, the educated man has the advantage over the  uneducated, and his abler mind will sooner or later be of use to him,  although his physique may be weaker than the other's. The  gently-nurtured individual finds the preliminary trials of colonial life  very hard indeed--he is heavily handicapped at the start--but there is  no reason why he may not do well after a time. Gentlemen-immigrants  usually think they may find work of a congenial sort, such as clerking,  assisting in a store, or some occupation of the kind in the city. That  is a mistake; while yet they are new-chums there is but one thing for  them to do--to go away into the bush and labour with their hands. Of  new-chums, only artisans are absorbed into the city population as a  rule; all others have to look to manual labour of some kind, and  generally up-country, for a means of subsistence. All the clerks,  counter-jumpers, secretaries, and so on, are either old colonials, or  colonists' sons. Very rare is it for a gentleman new-chum to find a  berth of that sort, perhaps he may after he has become \"colonized,\" but  at first he will have to go straight away and fell bush, chop firewood,  drive cattle, or tend pigs. About the best advice I ever heard given to  middle-class men, who thought of emigrating to New Zealand, was couched  in some such terms as these.    \"What are your prospects here? If you have any, stop where you are. But  if you have no particular profession, nothing better before you than  laborious quill-driving and the like, at eighty pounds a year, and small  probability of ever rising so high as two hundred, however many years  you stick to the desk, or the yard-measure, then you may think of  emigrating. If you are strong and able-bodied, somewhere between sixteen  and twenty-six years of age--for over twenty-six men are generally too  old to emigrate, I think--I say, emigrate by all means, for you will  have a better chance of leading a healthy, happy, and fairly comfortable  life. But you must throw all ideas of gentility to the winds, banish the  thought of refinement, and prepare for a rough, hard struggle, and it  may be a long one, too. You may please yourselves with the prospect of  competence, comfort, and even luxury in the distance, but you must look  at it through a lengthy vista of real hard work, difficulty, and bodily  hardship. Success, in a greater or lesser degree, _always_ follows  patient industry at the Antipodes; it can scarcely be said to do so in  Britain.    \"Now, _Il n'y a que le premier pas qui coute_, and the worst time you  will have is at the first; also, it is only for the start that you need  advice, after you become 'colonized' you can look out for yourselves. If  you have any particular acquaintance with a useful trade, so much the  better; if you have not, and can do so, learn one before you  go--carpentry, boat-building, blacksmithing, tinkering, cobbling; it  will help you through wonderfully. It doesn't matter twopence _how_ you  go out, whether saloon, intermediate, or steerage, so far as your future  prospects are concerned. If you can compass the means, go saloon--the  extra comfort on a long voyage is well worth the extra price; besides,  you might have some returning colonist as fellow-voyager, whose  friendship would prove useful. When you land, bank any money you may  have brought with you--whether it be ten pounds or ten thousand, I say  the same--and resolve not to touch it, however you may be tempted, for  two years at least. Then go about freely, get into the bush away from  the city, make friends with every one everywhere, and let it be known  that you are in search of work. Very soon you will hear of something or  other. Take the job, the first that comes in your way, and stick to it  till something better turns up. Don't be afraid of it whatever it is;  don't imagine anything will hurt you or lower your dignity in the  slightest so long as it is honest. Even if they make you a  street-scavenger, remember that is better than loafing. In one year, or  two, or three, you will be perfectly at home in the new life, and able  to see, according to your abilities, the path that offers you the best  prospect of the greatest success. During your new-chum days of  apprenticeship you must consider yourself as a common peasant, like the  men you will probably have to associate with; don't be disconcerted at  that, just work on, and by-and-by you will get ahead of them. You will  meet plenty of nice gentlemanly fellows in any part of New Zealand, and  they will think all the better of you if you are earnestly and  energetically industrious. Lastly, don't run away with the notion that  you are going to jump into luck directly you land. Wages are high to the  right people, but you are not among those at the outset. You may be  satisfied if you do anything more than just earn your keep, for the  first six or twelve months.\"    I think that that is, upon the whole, pretty sound advice for the class  of men to whom it is addressed; but I will go further, and point out  what advantages the average middle-class \"young gentleman\" may  reasonably look forward to from emigration to New Zealand. In the first  place, he may expect to enjoy robust health, more perfect and enjoyable  than he could hope for if tied down to a counting-house stool in the  dingy atmosphere of a city. He will exchange the dull monotony of a  sedentary occupation in the chill and varying climate of Britain, for a  life of vigorous action in a land whose climate is simply superb. When  he gets through the briars that must necessarily be traversed at the  outset, he will find himself happier, freer from anxiety, and, on the  whole, doing better than he would be if he had remained at the old life.  He will \"feel his life in every limb,\" and, remote from the world, know  naught of its cares. If he be anything of a man, before ten or a dozen  years are gone he will find himself with a bit of land and a house of  his own; he will be married, or able to marry, his earnings will suffice  for existence, while every pound saved and invested in property will be  growing, doubling, and quadrupling itself for his age and his children.  There is something to work for and hope for here: independence,  contentment, and competence. It is not a stern struggle from year's end  to year's end, with naught at the finish but a paltry pension,  dependence on others, or the workhouse. The gentleman-colonist we are  talking of is working for a _home_, and, long before his term of life  draws to its close, he will find himself, if not rich, at any rate, in  the possession of more comfort and happiness than he could hope for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#8)"],[1,"and line require to be long; the fly when  fastened to the hook should be allowed to float gently on the surface of  the water, keeping the line from touching it, and the angler should  stand as far as may be from the water's edge with the sun at his back,  having a watchful eye and a quick hand. Fish may be intoxicated and  taken in the following manner. Take an equal quantity of cocculus  indicus, coriander, fenugreek, and cummin seeds, and reduce them to a  powder. Make it into a paste with rice flour and water, roll it up into  pills as large as peas, and throw them into ponds or rivers which abound  with fish. After eating the paste, the fish will rise to the surface of  the water almost motionless, and may be taken out by the hand.      ANTIDOTE to opium or laudanum. The deleterious effects of opium, which  are so often experienced in the form of laudanum, may in great measure  be counteracted by taking a proper quantity of lemon juice immediately  afterwards. Four grains of opium, or a hundred drops of laudanum, are  often sufficient for a fatal dose; but if an ounce of pure lemon juice,  or twice that quantity of good vinegar be added to every grain of opium,  or every twenty-five drops of laudanum, it will relieve both the head  and the bowels; and the use of vegetable acids cannot be too strongly  recommended to those who are under the necessity of taking considerable  doses of opiates.      ANTS. Though it does not become us to be prodigal of life in any form,  nor wantonly to seek its extinction, yet where any species of animals  are found to be really noxious or annoying, the good of man requires  that they should be destroyed. Houses are sometimes so infested with  ants, that they are not to be endured. In this case, sprinkle the places  they frequent with a strong decoction of walnut-tree leaves; or take  half a pound of sulphur, and a quarter of a pound of potash, and  dissolve them together over the fire. Afterwards beat them to a powder,  add some water to it; and when sprinkled, the ants will either die or  leave the place. When they are found to traverse garden walls or  hot-houses, and to injure the fruit, several holes should be drilled in  the ground with an iron crow, close to the side of the wall, and as deep  as the soil will admit. The earth being stirred, the insects will begin  to move about: the sides of the holes are then to be made smooth, so  that the ants may fall in as soon as they approach, and they will be  unable to climb upwards. Water being then poured on them, great numbers  may easily be destroyed. The same end may be answered by strewing a  mixture of quick lime and soot along such places as are much frequented  by the ants; or by adding water to it, and pouring it at the roots of  trees infested by them. To prevent their descending from a tree which  they visit, it is only necessary to mark with a piece of common chalk a  circle round its trunk, an inch or two broad, and about two feet from  the ground. This experiment should be performed in dry weather, and the  ring must be renewed: as soon as the ants arrive at it, not one of them  will attempt to cross over.--Ant hills are very injurious in dry  pastures, not only by wasting the soil, but yielding a pernicious kind  of grass, and impeding the operation of the scythe. The turf of the ant  hill should be pared off, the core taken out and scattered at a  distance; and when the turf is laid down again, the place should be left  lower than the ground around it, that when the wet settles into it, the  ants may be prevented from returning to their haunt. The nests may more  effectually be destroyed by putting quick lime into them, and pouring on  some water; or by putting in some night soil, and closing it up.      APPLE TREES may be preserved from the innumerable insects with which  they are annoyed, by painting the stems and branches with a thick wash  of lime and water, as soon as the sap begins to rise. This will be  found, in the course of the ensuing summer to have removed all the moss  and insects, and given to the bark a fresh and green appearance. Other  fruit trees may be treated in the same manner, and they will soon become  more healthy and vigorous. Trees exposed to cattle, hares and rabbits,  may be preserved from these depredators, without the expense of fence or  rails, by any of the following experiments. Wash the stems of the trees  or plants to a proper height with tanner's liquor, or such as they use  for dressing hides. If this does not succeed, make a mixture of night  soil, lime and water, and brush it on the stems and branches, two or  three times in a year: this will effectually preserve the trees from  being barked. A mixture of fresh cow dung and urine has been found to  answer the same purpose, and also to destroy the canker, which is so  fatal to the growth of trees.      APPLES are best preserved from frost, by throwing over them a linen  cloth before the approach of hard weather: woollen will not answer the  purpose. In this manner they are kept in Germany and in America, during  the severest winters; and it is probable that potatoes might be  preserved in the same way. Apples may also be kept till the following  summer by putting them into a dry jar, with a few pebbles at the bottom  to imbibe the moisture which would otherwise destroy the fruit, and then  closing up the jar carefully with a lid, and a little fresh water round  the edge.      APPLES DRIED. Put them in a cool oven six or seven times; and when soft  enough to bear it, let them be gently flattened by degrees. If the oven  be too warm they will waste; and at first it should be very cool. The  biffin, the minshul crab, or any tart apples, are the best for drying.      APPLE DUMPLINGS. Pare and slice some apples, line a bason with a thin  paste, fill it with the fruit, and close the paste over. Tie a cloth  tight over, and boil the dumpling till the fruit is done. Currant and  damson puddings are prepared in the same way.      APPLE FOOL. Stew some apples in a stone jar on a stove, or in a saucepan  of water over the fire: if the former, a large spoonful of water should  be added to the fruit. When reduced to a pulp, peel and press them  through a cullendar; boil a sufficient quantity of new milk, and a  tea-cupful of raw cream, or an egg instead of the latter, and leave the  liquor to cool. Then mix it gradually with the pulp, and sweeten the  whole with fine moist sugar.      APPLE FRITTERS. Pare some apples, and cut them into thin slices; put a  spoonful of light batter into a frying-pan, then a layer of apples, and  another spoonful of batter. Fry them to a light brown, and serve with  grated sugar over them.      APPLE JELLY. Prepare twenty golden pippins, boil them quite tender in a  pint and a half of spring water, and strain the pulp through a  cullendar. To every pint add a pound of fine sugar, with grated orange  or lemon peel, and then boil the whole to a jelly. Or, having prepared  the apples by boiling and straining them through a coarse sieve, get  ready an ounce of isinglass boiled to a jelly in half a pint of water,  and mix it with the apple pulp. Add some sugar, a little lemon juice and  peel; boil all together, take out the peel, and put the jelly into a  dish, to serve at table.--When apple jelly is required for preserving  apricots, or any sort of sweetmeats, a different process is observed.  Apples are to be pared, quartered and cored, and put into a stewpan,  with as much water as will cover them. Boil them to a mash as quick as  possible, and add a quantity of water; then boil half an hour more, and  run it through a jelly bag. If in summer, codlins are best: in autumn,  golden rennets or winter pippins.--Red apples in jelly are a different  preparation. These must be pared and cored, and thrown into water; then  put them in a preserving pan, and let them coddle with as little water  as will only half cover them. Observe that they do not lie too close  when first put in; and when the under side is done, turn them. Mix some  pounded cochineal with the water, and boil with the fruit. When  sufficiently done, take them out on the dish they are to be served in,  the stalk downwards. Make a rich jelly of the water with loaf sugar,  boiling them with the thin rind and juice of a lemon. When cold, spread  the jelly over the apples; cut the lemon peel into narrow strips, and  put them across the eye of the apple. The colour should be kept fine  from the first, or the fruit will not afterwards gain it; and use as  little of the cochineal as will serve, lest the syrup taste bitter.      APPLE MARMALADE. Scald some apples till they come to a pulp; then take  an equal weight of sugar in large lumps, just dip them in water, and  boil the sugar till it can be well skimmed, and is reduced to a thick  syrup. Put it to the pulp, and simmer it on a quick fire a quarter of an  hour. Grate a little lemon peel before boiling, but if too much it will  be bitter.      APPLE PASTY. Make a hot crust of lard or dripping, roll it out warm,  cover it with apples pared and sliced, and a little lemon peel and moist  sugar. Wet the edges of the crust, close it up well, make a few holes in  the top, and bake it in a moderate oven. Gooseberries may be done in the  same way.      APPLE PIE. Pare and core the fruit, after being wiped clean; then boil  the cores and parings in a little water, till it tastes well. Strain the  liquor, add a little sugar, with a bit of bruised cinnamon, and simmer  again. Meantime place the apples in a dish, a paste being put round the  edge; when one layer is in, sprinkle half the sugar, and shred lemon  peel; squeeze in some of the juice, or a glass of cider, if the apples  have lost their spirit. Put in the rest of the apples, the sugar, and  the liquor which has been boiled. If the pie be eaten hot, put some  butter into it, quince marmalade, orange paste or cloves, to give it a  flavour.      APPLE"]]]
