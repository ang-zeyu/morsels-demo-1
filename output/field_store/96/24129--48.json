The unfortunate creatures had already passed a whole week with their  legs caught and pressed by the cleft beams which formed these  inexpressibly painful stocks. When the unfortunate victims were  released, the fanatics screamed with rage at the sight of their swollen  bodies and half-broken bones. None of the unhappy people were able to  stand. The attack on the soldiers was renewed, and these being driven  out of the lower hall, filled the staircase leading to the abbe's  apartments, and offered such determined resistance that their assailants  were twice forced to fall back. Laporte, seeing two of his men killed  and five or six wounded, called out loudly, \"Children of God, lay down  your arms: this way of going to work is too slow; let us burn the abbey  and all in it. To work! to work!\" The advice was good, and they all  hastened to follow it: benches, chairs, and furniture of all sorts were  heaped up in the hall, a palliasse thrown on the top, and the pile  fired. In a moment the whole building was ablaze, and the Arch-priest,  yielding to the entreaties of his servants, fastened his sheets to the  window-bars, and by their help dropped into the garden. The drop was so  great that he broke one of his thigh bones, but dragging himself along  on his hands and one knee, he, with one of his servants, reached a  recess in the wall, while another servant was endeavouring to escape  through the flames, thus falling into the hands of the fanatics, who  carried him before their captain. Then cries of \"The prophet! the  prophet!\" were heard on all sides. Esprit Seguier, feeling that  something fresh had taken place, came forward, still holding in his hand  the blazing torch with which he had set fire to the pile.    \"Brother,\" asked Laporte, pointing to the prisoner, \"is this man to  die?\"    Esprit Seguier fell on his knees and covered his face with his mantle,  like Samuel, and sought the Lord in prayer, asking to know His will.    In a short time he rose and said, \"This man is not to die; for inasmuch  as he has showed mercy to our brethren we must show mercy to him.\"    Whether this fact had been miraculously revealed to Seguier, or whether  he had gained his information from other sources, the newly released  prisoners confirmed its truth, calling out that the man had indeed  treated them with humanity. Just then a roar as of a wild beast was  heard: one of the fanatics, whose brother had been put to death by the  abbe, had just caught sight of him, the whole neighbourhood being lit up  by the fire; he was kneeling in an angle of the wall, to which he had  dragged himself.    \"Down with the son of Belial!\" shouted the crowd, rushing towards the  priest, who remained kneeling and motionless like a marble statue. His  valet took advantage of the confusion to escape, and got off easily; for  the sight of him on whom the general hate was concentrated made the  Huguenots forget everything else:    Esprit Seguier was the first to reach the priest, and spreading his  hands over him, he commanded the others to hold back. \"God desireth not  the death of a sinner,'\" said he, \"'but rather that he turn from his  wickedness and live.'\"    \"No, no!\" shouted a score of voices, refusing obedience for the first  time, perhaps, to an order from the prophet; \"let him die without mercy,  as he struck without pity. Death to the son of Belial, death!\"    \"Silence!\" exclaimed the prophet in a terrible voice, \"and listen to the  word of God from my mouth. If this man will join us and take upon him  the duties of a pastor, let us grant him his life, that he may  henceforward devote it to the spread of the true faith.\"    \"Rather a thousand deaths than apostasy!\" answered the priest.    \"Die, then!\" cried Laporte, stabbing him; \"take that for having burnt my  father in Nimes.\"    And he passed on the dagger to Esprit Seguier.    Duchayla made neither sound nor gesture: it would have seemed as if the  dagger had been turned by the priest's gown as by a coat of mail were it  not that a thin stream of blood appeared. Raising his eyes to heaven, he  repeated the words of the penitential psalm: \"Out of the depths have I  cried unto Thee, O Lord! Lord, hear my voice!\"    Then Esprit Seguier raised his arm and struck in his turn, saying, \"Take  that for my son, whom you broke on the wheel at Montpellier.\"    And he passed on the dagger.    But this blow also was not mortal, only another stream of blood  appeared, and the abbe said in a failing voice, \"Deliver me, O my  Saviour, out of my well-merited sufferings, and I will acknowledge their  justice; far I have been a man of blood.\"    The next who seized the dagger came near and gave his blow, saying,  \"Take that for my brother, whom you let die in the 'ceps.'\"    This time the dagger pierced the heart, and the abbe had only time to  ejaculate, \"Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy!\"  before he fell back dead.    But his death did not satisfy the vengeance of those who had not been  able to strike him living; one by one they drew near and stabbed, each  invoking the shade of some dear murdered one and pronouncing the same  words of malediction.    In all, the body of the abbe received fifty-two dagger thrusts, of which  twenty-four would have been mortal.    Thus perished, at the age of fifty-five, Messire Francois de Langlade  Duchayla, prior of Laval, inspector of missions in Gevaudan, and  Arch-priest of the Cevennes and Mende.    Their vengeance thus accomplished, the murderers felt that there was no  more safety for them in either city or plain, and fled to the mountains;  but in passing near the residence of M. de Laveze, a Catholic nobleman  of the parish of Molezon, one of the fugitives recollected that he had  heard that a great number of firearms was kept in the house. This seemed  a lucky chance, for firearms were what the Huguenots needed most of all.  They therefore sent two envoys to M. de Laveze to ask him to give them  at, least a share of his weapons; but he, as a good Catholic, replied  that it was quite true that he had indeed a store of arms, but that they  were destined to the triumph and not to the desecration of religion, and  that he would only give them up with his life. With these words, he  dismissed the envoys, barring his doors behind them.    But while this parley was going on the conspirators had approached the  chateau, and thus received the valiant answer to their demands sooner  than M. de Laveze had counted on. Resolving not to leave him time to  take defensive measures, they dashed at the house, and by standing on  each other's shoulders reached the room in which M. de Laveze and his  entire family had taken refuge. In an instant the door was forced, and  the fanatics, still reeking with the life-blood of Abbe Duchayla, began  again their work of death. No one was spared; neither the master of the  house, nor his brother, nor his uncle, nor his sister, who knelt to the  assassins in vain; even his old mother, who was eighty years of age,  having from her bed first witnessed the murder of all her family, was at  last stabbed to the heart, though the butchers might have reflected that  it was hardly worth while thus to anticipate the arrival of Death, who  according to the laws of nature must have been already at hand.    The massacre finished, the fanatics spread over the castle, supplying  themselves with arms and under-linen, being badly in need of the latter;  for when they left their homes they had expected soon to return, and had  taken nothing with them. They also carried off the copper kitchen  utensils, intending to turn them into bullets. Finally, they seized on a  sum of 5000 francs, the marriage-portion of M. de Laveze's sister, who  was just about to be married, and thus laid the foundation of a war  fund.    The news of these two bloody events soon reached not only Nimes but all  the countryside, and roused the authorities to action. M. le Comte de  Broglie crossed the Upper Cevennes, and marched down to the bridge of  Montvert, followed by several companies of fusiliers. From another  direction M. le Comte de Peyre brought thirty-two cavalry and three  hundred and fifty infantry, having enlisted them at Marvejols, La  Canourgue, Chiac, and Serverette. M. de St. Paul, Abbe Duchayla's  brother, and the Marquis Duchayla, his nephew, brought eighty horsemen  from the family estates. The Count of Morangiez rode in from St. Auban  and Malzieu with two companies of cavalry, and the town of Mende by  order of its bishop despatched its nobles at the head of three companies  of fifty men each.    But the mountains had swallowed up the fanatics, and nothing was ever  known of their fate, except that from time to time a peasant would  relate that in crossing the Cevennes he had heard at dawn or dusk, on  mountain peak or from valley depths, the sound going up to heaven of  songs of praise. It was the fanatic assassins worshipping God.    Or occasionally at night, on the tops of the lofty mountains, fires  shone forth which appeared to signal one to another, but on looking the  next night in the same direction all was dark.    So M. de Broglie, concluding that nothing could be done against enemies  who were invisible, disbanded the troops which had come to his aid, and  went back to Montpellier, leaving a company of fusiliers at Collet,  another at Ayres, one at the bridge of Montvert, one at Barre, and one  at Pompidon, and appointing Captain Poul as their chief.    This choice of such a man as chief showed that M. de Broglie was a good  judge of human nature, and was also perfectly acquainted with the  situation, for Captain Poul was the very man to take a leading part in  the coming struggle. \"He was,\" says Pere Louvreloeil, priest of the  Christian doctrine and cure of Saint-Germain de Calberte, \"an officer of  merit and reputation, born in Ville-Dubert, near"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#8)"],[1," to the  terrible catastrophe that, since the queen's liaison with Bothwell, some  had already foreseen.    Towards the end of the month of October, 1566, while the queen was  holding a court of justice at Jedburgh, it was announced to her that  Bothwell, in trying to seize a malefactor called John Elliot of Park,  had been badly wounded in the hand; the queen, who was about to attend  the council, immediately postponed the sitting till next day, and,  having ordered a horse to be saddled, she set out for Hermitage Castle,  where Bothwell was living, and covered the distance at a stretch,  although it was twenty miles, and she had to go across woods, marshes,  and rivers; then, having remained some hours tete-a-tete with him, she  set out again with the same sped for Jedburgh, to which she returned in  the night.    Although this proceeding had made a great deal of talk, which was  inflamed still more by the queen's enemies, who chiefly belonged to the  Reformed religion, Darnley did not hear of it till nearly two months  afterwards--that is to say, when Bothwell, completely recovered,  returned with the queen to Edinburgh.    Then Darnley thought that he ought not to put up any longer with such  humiliations. But as, since his treason to his accomplices, he had not  found in all Scotland a noble who would have drawn the sword for him, he  resolved to go and seek the Earl of Lennox, his father, hoping that  through his influence he could rally the malcontents, of whom there were  a great number since Bothwell had been in favour. Unfortunately,  Darnley, indiscreet and imprudent as usual, confided this plan to some  of his officers, who warned Bothwell of their master's intention.  Bothwell did not seem to oppose the journey in any way; but Darnley was  scarcely a mile from Edinburgh when he felt violent pains none the less,  he continued his road, and arrived very ill at Glasgow. He immediately  sent for a celebrated doctor, called James Abrenets, who found his body  covered with pimples, and declared without any hesitation that he had  been poisoned. However, others, among them Walter Scott, state that this  illness was nothing else than smallpox.    Whatever it may have been, the queen, in the presence of the danger her  husband ran, appeared to forget her resentment, and at the risk of what  might prove troublesome to herself, she went to Darnley, after sending  her doctor in advance. It is true that if one is to believe in the  following letters, dated from Glasgow, which Mary is accused of having  written to Bothwell, she knew the illness with which he was attacked too  well to fear infection. As these letters are little known, and seem to  us very singular we transcribe them here; later we shall tell how they  fell into the power of the Confederate lords, and from their hands  passed into Elizabeth's, who, quite delighted, cried on receiving them,  \"God's death, then I hold her life and honour in my hands!\"    FIRST LETTER    \"When I set out from the place where I had left my heart, judge in what  a condition I was, poor body without a soul: besides, during the whole  of dinner I have not spoken to anyone, and no one has dared to approach  me, for it was easy to see that there was something amiss. When I  arrived within a league of the town, the Earl of Lennox sent me one of  his gentlemen to make me his compliments, and to excuse himself for not  having come in person; he has caused me to be informed, moreover, that  he did not dare to present himself before me after the reprimand that I  gave Cunningham. This gentleman begged me, as if of his own accord, to  examine his master's conduct, to ascertain if my suspicions were well  founded. I have replied to him that fear was an incurable disease, that  the Earl of Lennox would not be so agitated if his conscience reproached  him with nothing, and that if some hasty words had escaped me, they were  but just reprisals for the letter he had written me.    \"None of the inhabitants visited me, which makes me think they are all  in his interests; besides, they speak of him very favourably, as well as  of his son. The king sent for Joachim yesterday, and asked him why I did  not lodge with him, adding that my presence would soon cure him, and  asked me also with what object I had come: if it were to be reconciled  with him; if you were here; if I had taken Paris and Gilbert as  secretaries, and if I were still resolved to dismiss Joseph? I do not  know who has given him such accurate information. There is nothing, down  to the marriage of Sebastian, with which he has not made himself  acquainted. I have asked him the meaning of one of his letters, in which  he complains of the cruelty of certain people. He replied that he  was--stricken, but that my presence caused him so much joy that he  thought he should die of it. He reproached me several times for being  dreamy; I left him to go to supper; he begged me to return: I went back.  Then he told me the story of his illness, and that he wished to make a  will leaving me everything, adding that I was a little the cause of his  trouble, and that he attributed it to my coldness. 'You ask me,' added  he, 'who are the people of whom I complain: it is of you, cruel one, of  you, whom I have never been able to appease by my tears and my  repentance. I know that I have offended you, but not on the matter that  you reproach me with: I have also offended some of your subjects, but  that you have forgiven me. I am young, and you say that I always relapse  into my faults; but cannot a young man like me, destitute of experience,  gain it also, break his promises, repent directly, and in time improve?  If you will forgive me yet once more, I will promise to offend you never  again. All the favour I ask of you is that we should live together like  husband and wife, to have but one bed and one board: if you are  inflexible, I shall never rise again from here. I entreat you, tell me  your decision: God alone knows what I suffer, and that because I occupy  myself with you only, because I love and adore only you. If I have  offended you sometimes, you must bear the reproach; for when someone  offends me, if it were granted me to complain to you, I should not  confide my griefs to others; but when we are on bad terms, I am obliged  to keep them to myself, and that maddens me.'    \"He then urged me strongly to stay with him and lodge in his house; but  I excused myself, and replied that he ought to be purged, and that he  could not be, conveniently, at Glasgow; then he told me that he knew I  had brought a letter for him, but that he would have preferred to make  the journey with me. He believed, I think, that I meant to send him to  some prison: I replied that I should take him to Craigmiller, that he  would find doctors there, that I should remain near him, and that we  should be within reach of seeing my son. He has answered that he will go  where I wish to take him, provided that I grant him what he has asked.  He does not, however, wish to be seen by anyone.    \"He has told me more than a hundred pretty things that I cannot repeat  to you, and at which you yourself would be surprised: he did not want to  let me go; he wanted to make me sit up with him all night. As for me, I  pretended to believe everything, and I seemed to interest myself really  in him. Besides, I have never seen him so small and humble; and if I had  not known how easily his heart overflows, and how mine is impervious to  every other arrow than those with which you have wounded it, I believe  that I should have allowed myself to soften; but lest that should alarm  you, I would die rather than give up what I have promised you. As for  you, be sure to act in the same way towards those traitors who will do  all they can to separate you from me. I believe that all those people  have been cast in the same mould: this one always has a tear in his eye;  he bows down before everyone, from the greatest to the smallest; he  wishes to interest them in his favour, and make himself pitied. His  father threw up blood to-day through the nose and mouth; think what  these symptoms mean. I have not seen him yet, for he keeps to the house.  The king wants me to feed him myself; he won't eat unless I do. But,  whatever I may do, you will be deceived by it no more than I shall be  deceiving myself. We are united, you and I, to two kinds of very  detestable people [Mary means Miss Huntly, Bothwell's wife, whom he  repudiated, at the king's death, to marry the queen.]: that hell may  sever these knots then, and that heaven may form better ones, that  nothing can break, that it may make of us the most tender and faithful  couple that ever was; there is the profession of faith in which I would  die.    \"Excuse my scrawl: you must guess more than the half of it, but I know  no help for this. I am obliged to write to you hastily while everyone is  asleep here: but be easy, I take infinite pleasure in my watch; for I  cannot sleep like the others, not being able to sleep as I would  like--that is to say, in your arms.    \"I am going to get into bed; I shall finish my letter tomorrow: I have  too many things to tell to you, the night is too far advanced: imagine  my despair. It is to you I am writing, it is of myself that I converse  with you, and I am obliged to make an end.    \"I cannot prevent myself, however, from filling up hastily the rest of  my paper. Cursed be the crazy creature who torments me so much! Were it  not for him, I could talk to you of more agreeable things: he is not  greatly changed; and yet he has taken a great deal of it. But he has  nearly killed me with the fetid smell of his breath; for now his is  still worse than your cousin's: you guess that this is a fresh reason  for my not approaching him; on the contrary, I go away as far as I can,  and sit on a chair at the foot of his bed.    \"Let us see if I forget anything:        \"His father's messenger on the"]]]
