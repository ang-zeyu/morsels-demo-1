I only wish one thing,\"  he added wistfully.    \"And I know what that is!\" cried Jack. \"You wish you were old enough  to volunteer for the army or the navy!\"    \"If we were all older what a grand company of volunteers the  Government could get out of Colby Hall,\" said Randy. \"I'll wager more  than half of the fellows would want to go.\"    \"I'm certain fellows like Codfish wouldn't want to go,\" remarked Fred.    He referred to one of the younger boys, Henry Stowell by name, a lad  who was a good deal of a sneak and who in time past had been a toady  to Brown and Martell. On account of the great width of his mouth,  Stowell was usually called Codfish.    \"If you fellows will keep a secret, I'll tell you something,\" remarked  Ralph Mason, lowering his voice. \"I just heard of this a while ago.\"    \"What is it, Ralph?\" questioned Jack quietly.    \"Will you fellows keep it to yourselves until it becomes public  property?\" asked the young major anxiously.    \"Sure!\" was the prompt response.    \"I overheard the talk quite by accident while I was in the library.  Colonel Colby was talking to Professors Grawson and Brice. He stated  that he intended to leave the Hall under the management of Captain  Dale.\"    \"You mean Colonel Colby is going away?\" questioned Fred. \"Where to?\"    \"He has offered his services to the Government.\"    \"Hurrah for the colonel! I knew he'd do something like that!\" cried  Randy.    \"Do you know whether his offer has been accepted?\" questioned Jack.    \"Of course his offer will be accepted,\" answered Ralph Mason. \"Now  that we are in this great war Uncle Sam will need all the soldiers he  can possibly muster, and of course they've got to have first-class men  like Colonel Colby to command them.\"    \"You're right there,\" said Fred. Then he looked questioningly at Jack  and the twins. The others understood that look, but just then nothing  was said concerning the thought which had rushed into their minds.    \"I've got to go now,\" said Ralph Mason, a few minutes later. \"I  suppose you fellows will want to celebrate that baseball victory  to-night?\"    \"Surest thing you know!\" declared Jack.    \"I don't suppose we'll have as much fun as we would have had if the  shell-loading plant hadn't gone up,\" grumbled Andy. \"We can't make any  such noise as that.\"    \"Oh, we'll have fun enough--don't worry about that,\" answered his twin  quickly.    \"Well, don't tear the old Hall down,\" returned the young major,  laughing, and then hurried away.    \"This certainly is great news about Colonel Colby's volunteering for  the army,\" said Jack, a little later.    \"I wonder why Captain Dale doesn't volunteer, too?\" said Andy.    \"Oh, he's too old; and besides he's somewhat crippled by rheumatism or  something,\" said Randy.    The Rover boys hurried off to their room to get into their cadet  uniforms. The twins went on ahead, leaving Jack and Fred alone for the  time being.    \"Jack, what do you think our fathers will do?\" questioned Fred. He  remembered that both Jack's father and his own had at one time been  officers of the cadets at Putnam Hall. The fun-loving father of the  twins had never aspired to such a position, being content to remain \"a  high private in the rear rank,\" as he himself had often expressed it.    \"I'm sure I don't know, Fred,\" was the sober reply. \"It may be that  they will be just as anxious to get into the war as Colonel Colby  seems to be. But you must remember that they are at the head of The  Rover Company, and possibly they won't be able to leave--at least not  right away.\"    \"But they are so patriotic they'll want to go,\" declared Fred.    \"Well, if they make up their minds to go, I guess we'll be among the  first to hear about it.\"    \"Gee, how I'd like to be a soldier boy!\" sighed Fred. \"Wouldn't it be  great if all of us cadets could go into the army?\"    \"We'll have to wait four or five years before we can do that, Fred.  And I rather think that by that time this great war will be over.\"    \"Oh, you can't tell how long a war like this will last. For all you  know the Germans may come right over here.\"    \"I don't think they'll do that. They'll have their hands full fighting  in Europe.\"    \"Well, they've sent their submarines over here already.\"    \"I know that. But I don't think they've got enough submarines to  transport an army that way.\"    Since coming to Colby Hall the Rover boys had occupied four very  pleasant rooms on the second floor in a wing of the great building.  But instead of using the four rooms for bedrooms, the twins slept  together and all used one of the extra rooms, No. 20, for a  sitting-room.    \"You fellows have got to hurry up or you'll be late for roll call!\"  cried Randy, when he entered.    \"Oh, I think they'll give us a little leeway on account of all the  excitement,\" returned Fred. And he was right,--the roll call and drill  were postponed for half an hour, for which many of the cadets were  thankful.    It did not take the Rovers long to throw off their baseball togs,  wash, and don their uniforms. Then they lost no time in rushing below  to the gun rack and obtaining their rifles, doing this just as the  drums rattled on the parade ground.    Soon the battalion of several companies was examined, and then began  the roll call. After this there was a brief inspection by Captain  Dale, with Colonel Colby looking on. Then the drums rattled and the  fifes struck up a lively march air, and the cadets marched around the  grounds, disposed of their rifles, and entered the mess hall of the  institution. Here each had his place assigned to him at one of the  long tables, each table presided over by one of the officers or a  teacher.    The meal was a substantial one, for Colonel Colby believed in treating  his pupils well, and it is perhaps needless to state that all of the  cadets fell to with vigor. There was a constant clatter of forks and  knives, mingled with a flow of lively conversation, carried on,  however, in rather a subdued tone, for boisterousness of any sort in  the mess hall was against regulations. After each lad finished he  excused himself and left the hall, and soon all of them had scattered  in various directions.    \"Bonfires to-night!\" announced Andy gaily, as he turned a handspring  on the campus.    \"I think we ought to have some sort of feast,\" said Fred.    \"Great Caesar, Fred! didn't you get enough to eat at supper?\" queried  Jack.    \"Oh, you know what I mean--a little something to eat just before we go  to bed!\" answered his cousin.    \"Suits me!\" was the cry from the others.    Talk about the victory over Hixley High and about the excitement  attending the destruction of the shell-loading plant filled the air.  The cadets were only boys, and the facts regarding the awful  occurrence across the lake could not subdue their high spirits when  they considered their great victory over the high school.    \"We've just got to celebrate and let off steam somehow,\" was the way  Randy expressed himself.    Boxes and barrels had already been stored away in anticipation of a  victory, and these were promptly brought forth and placed on the  river front. They were piled as high as possible and then set on fire,  the flames shooting skyward quickly and illuminating the scene for a  long distance around.    \"Hello there, Codfish!\" cried Andy gaily, when he beheld the sneak of  the school standing not far from one of the bonfires.    \"Got any more boxes to put on the fire, Codfish?\" questioned Randy,  who was beside his twin.    \"I haven't got any boxes,\" grumbled the young cadet. Since the  departure of Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell from the Hall, Codfish  had kept a good deal to himself. But he was as much of a sneak as  ever, and did many mean things which were exceedingly irritating to  the other cadets.    \"You haven't any boxes?\" said Randy, in apparent surprise. \"What's the  use of talking like that? You know better;\" and then he winked at his  brother.    \"I'm on,\" whispered Andy quickly. \"Bring him up to his room in about  ten minutes.\" And then he ran away at top speed.    \"It's a waste of good money to burn up boxes and barrels like that,\"  was Codfish's comment. \"I don't see why Colonel Colby allows it.  Those boxes and barrels could be used to pack all sorts of things  in.\"    \"Well, if you don't like to see the boxes and barrels burned up, why  don't you furnish us with a little cord wood?\" inquired Gif Garrison,  who had come up.    \"That's the talk!\" said Jack quickly. \"Show us where you've got your  cord wood stored, Codfish,\" he went on, after Randy had whispered in  his ear. Then Randy ran off in the direction his twin had taken.    \"I haven't any cord wood, I tell you!\" stormed Codfish. \"And I haven't  any boxes or barrels, either!\" and then he walked away to get clear of  his tormentors.    But Jack remembered what Randy had said to him, and did not allow  Codfish out of his sight. He kept the sneak in view, and quickly  gathered Spouter, Gif, Fatty, Walt, and a number of others around him.    \"We're going to take Codfish up to his room in a few minutes and treat  him to the surprise of his life,\" he explained. \"Don't forget to come  along and see the fun.\"          CHAPTER VII    FUN WITH CODFISH      The idea of having a little fun with Codfish had occurred to Andy and  Randy on the day previous, when they had been out collecting some  boxes and barrels for the bonfires which they hoped to have--provided,  of course, that Hixley High was beaten in the baseball contest. They  had talked the matter over for some time, and had then set to work,  laying their plans to give the sneak of the school the surprise of his  life.    \"What's doing, Jack?\" questioned Walt Baxter, in some surprise.    \"Going to put one"]]]
