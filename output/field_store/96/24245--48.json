They detested each other with a  detestation rooted in the most essential differences of character and  outlook. As good fortune arranged it, however, each came to occupy  precisely that political station in which he could do his best work  and from which he could best correct the bias of the other. Marshall's  nationalism rescued American democracy from the vaguer horizons to which  Jefferson's cosmopolitanism beckoned, and gave to it a secure abode  with plenty of elbowroom. Jefferson's emphasis on the right of the  contemporary majority to shape its own institutions prevented Marshall's  constitutionalism from developing a privileged aristocracy. Marshall  was finely loyal to principles accepted from others; Jefferson was  speculative, experimental; the personalities of these two men did much  to conserve essential values in the American Republic.    As Jefferson turned from his oath-taking to deliver his inaugural,  Marshall must have listened with attentive ears for some hint of the  attitude which the new Administration proposed to take with regard  to the Federal Judiciary and especially with regard to the recent act  increasing its numbers; but if so, he got nothing for his pains. The new  President seemed particularly bent upon dispelling any idea that there  was to be a political proscription. Let us, said he, \"unite with one  heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony  and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary  things.... Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.  We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are  all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\"    Notwithstanding the reassurance of these words, the atmosphere both  of official Washington and of the country at large was electric with  dangerous currents--dangerous especially to judges--and Jefferson  was far too well known as an adept in the manipulation of political  lightning to admit of much confidence that he would fail to turn these  forces against his enemy when the opportune moment should arrive.  The national courts were regarded with more distrust by the mass of  Republicans than any other part of the hated system created by the once  dominant Federalists. The reasons why this was so have already been  indicated, but the most potent reason in 1801, because it was still  freshest in mind, was the domineering part which the national judges  had played in the enforcement of the Sedition Act. The terms of this  illiberal measure made, and were meant to make, criticism of the party  in power dangerous. The judges--Federalists to a man and bred, moreover,  in a tradition which ill-distinguished the office of judge from that of  prosecutor-felt little call to mitigate the lot of those who fell within  the toils of the law under this Act. A shining mark for the Republican  enemies of the Judiciary was Justice Samuel Chase of the Supreme Court.  It had fallen to Chase's lot to preside successively at the trial  of Thomas Cooper for sedition, at the second trial of John Fries for  treason, and at the trial of James Thompson Callender at Richmond for  sedition. On each of the two latter occasions the defendant's counsel,  charging \"oppressive conduct\" on the part of the presiding judge, had  thrown up their briefs and rushed from the court room. In 1800 there  were few Republicans who did not regard Chase as \"the bloody Jeffreys of  America.\"    Local conditions also frequently accentuated the prevailing prejudice  against the Judiciary. The people of Kentucky, afraid that their badly  tangled land titles were to be passed upon by the new Federal Courts,  were already insisting, when Jefferson took office, that the Act of  the 13th of February creating these courts be repealed. In Maryland  extensive and radical alterations of the judicial system of the State  were pending. In Pennsylvania the situation was even more serious, for  though the judges of the higher courts of that commonwealth were usually  men of ability, education, and character, the inferior magistrates were  frequently the very opposite. By the state constitution judges were  removable for serious offenses by impeachment, and for lesser reasons  by the Governor upon the address of two-thirds of both branches of the  Legislature. So long, however, as the Federalists had remained in power  neither remedy had been applied; but in 1799, when the Republicans  had captured both the governorship and the Legislature, a much needed  purgation of the lower courts had forthwith begun.    Unfortunately this is a sort of reform that grows by what it feeds  upon. Having got rid of the less fit members of the local judiciary,  the Republican leaders next turned their attention to some of their  aggressive party foes on the Superior Bench. The most offensive of these  was Alexander Addison, president of one of the Courts of Common Pleas of  the State. He had started life as a Presbyterian preacher and had  found it natural to add to his normal judicial duties the business of  inculcating \"sound morals and manners.\" * Addison had at once taken the  Alien and Sedition laws under his wing, though their enforcement did not  fall within his jurisdiction, and he found in the progress of the French  Revolution numerous texts for partisan harangues to county juries. For  some reason Addison's enemies decided to resort to impeachment rather  than to removal by address; and, as a result, in January, 1803, the  State Senate found him guilty of \"misdemeanor,\" ordered his removal from  office, and disqualified him for judicial office in Pennsylvania. Not  long afterwards the House of Representatives granted without inquiry or  discussion a petition to impeach three members of the Supreme Court of  the State for having punished one Thomas Passmore for contempt of court  without a jury trial.       * President Dickinson of Pennsylvania wrote the Chief Justice and  judges of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth, on October 8, 1785,  that they ought not to content themselves merely with enforcing the  law, but should also endeavor to \"inculcate sound morals and manners.\"  \"Pennsylvania Archives,\" vol. X, pp. 623-24.      Jefferson entered office with his mind made up that the Act of the 18th  of February should be repealed. * He lacked only a theory whereby he  could reconcile this action with the Constitution, and that was soon  forthcoming. According to the author of this theory, John Taylor of  Caroline, a budding \"Doctor Irrefragabilis\" of the State Rights school,  the proposed repeal raised two questions: first, whether Congress  could abolish courts created by a previous act of Congress; and second,  whether, with such courts abolished, their judges still retained office.  Addressing himself to the first question, Taylor pointed out that the  Act of the 13th of February had itself by instituting a new system  abolished the then existing inferior courts. As to the second point,  he wrote thus: \"The Constitution declares that the judge shall hold his  office during good behavior. Could it mean that he should hold office  after it had been abolished? Could it mean that his tenure should  be limited by behaving well in an office which did not exist?\" A  construction based on such absurdities, said he, \"overturns the benefits  of language and intellect.\"       * In this connection Mr. Beveridge draws my attention to  Jefferson's letter to A. Stuart of April 5,1801. See the \"Complete Works  of Jefferson\" (Washington, 1857), vol. IV, p. 393.      In his message of December 8, 1801, Jefferson gave the signal for the  repeal of the obnoxious measure, and a month later Breckinridge of  Kentucky introduced the necessary resolution in the Senate. In the  prolonged debate which followed, the Republicans in both Senate and  House rang the changes on Taylor's argument. The Federalists made a  twofold answer. Some, accepting the Republican premise that the fate  of the judge was necessarily involved with that of the court, denied in  toto the validity of repeal. Gouverneur Morris, for instance, said: \"You  shall not take the man from the office but you may take the office from  the man; you may not drown him, but you may sink his boat under him....  Is this not absurd?\" Other Federalists, however, were ready to admit  that courts of statutory origin could be abolished by statute but added  that the operation of Congress's power in this connection was limited  by the plain requirement of the Constitution that judges of the United  States should hold office during good behavior. Hence, though a valid  repeal of the Act in question would take from the judges the powers  which they derived from its provisions, the repeal would still leave  them judges of the United States until they died, resigned, or were  legally removed in consequence of impeachment. The Federalist orators  in general contended that the spirit of the Constitution confirmed its  letter, and that its intention was clear that the national judges should  pass finally upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress and should  therefore be as secure as possible from legislative molestation.    The repeal of this Act was voted by a strict party majority and was  reinforced by a provision postponing the next session of the Supreme  Court until the following February. The Republican leaders evidently  hoped that by that time all disposition to test the validity of  the Repealing Act in the Court would have passed. But by this very  precaution they implied a recognition of the doctrine of judicial review  and the whole trend of the debate abundantly confirmed this implication.  Breckinridge, Randolph, and Giles, it is true, scouted the claim made  for the courts as \"unheard-of doctrine,\" and as \"mockery of the high  powers of legislation\"; but the rank and file of their followers,  with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#8)"],[1," king, not only is he put to death, but the whole of  the people of his village are often massacred.  Altogether an abominable  state of things prevails; there seems to be but one opinion throughout  the colony, that it is absolutely necessary for our safety that the Zulu  organisation shall be broken up.\"    \"I see,\" Mr Jackson said, \"that there is an advertisement in the papers  for waggons for the transport of stores, and the price offered is  excellent.  A large number are required; I was thinking of sending down  my two teams--what do you think?\"    \"I have been turning it over in my mind,\" Mr Humphreys replied, \"and I  am inclined also to offer my waggons.  The rate of pay is, as you say,  high, and they certainly will have a difficulty in obtaining the number  they require.  I shall not have need for mine for home purposes for a  considerable time now.  The hot weather will soon be setting in, and  planting is over for the season.  I shall of course go on digging holes  for my next batch, but I shall not want them up until after the end of  the hot season.  So I think, as I can spare them, I shall hire them to  government.  I think we ought all to do what we can to aid it at  present, for every one agrees as to the necessity of the steps it is now  taking.\"    \"And do you think that there will be any fighting, father?\"  Dick asked  eagerly.    \"That no one can say, my boy.  The Zulus are a proud as well as a brave  people, and believe that they are invincible.  I hardly think that they  will consent to break up their army and abandon their customs at our  dictation; I should not be surprised if it comes to fighting.\"    \"Oh, father, if you hire the waggons to government, may I go with them?  I can see that the Kaffirs look after the oxen, you know, and that  everything goes straight.  I have picked up a little Kaffir from Joel,  and can manage to make them understand.\"    \"Well, Dick,\" Mr Humphreys said, after a little thought, \"I don't know  that I have any objection to it; it will be a change for you, and of  course there will be no chance of the waggons being near if any fighting  goes on.  What do you think, Jackson?  I suppose your boy will want to  go if mine does?\"    \"Well, I don't mind,\" Mr Jackson answered.  \"I suppose it will not be  for long, for the boy is useful on the farm now.  However, as you say,  it will be a change, and boys like a little excitement.  Well, I suppose  I must say yes; they are fifteen now, and old enough to keep out of  mischief.\"    The boys were delighted at the prospect of the expedition, and at once  went out to talk matters over together.  They cordially agreed in the  hope that the Zulus would fight, and promised themselves that if  possible they would see something of it.  Their fathers would, they  thought, allow them to take their horses, and it would be easy, if the  waggons were left behind, to ride forward with the troops, and see what  went on.    Two days later the four teams started together for Pieter-Maritzburg.  Contrary to their expectations the boys were not allowed to take their  horses.    \"No, no, Dick,\" Mr Humphreys had said, when his son asked him, \"no  horses, if you please; I know what you will be up to.  Galloping about  to see what is going on, and getting into all sorts of mischief and  scrapes.  No, if you go, you go with the waggons, to see that everything  goes straight, to translate orders to the Kaffirs, and to learn  something of waggon-driving across a rough country.  For between this  place and Pieter-Maritzburg it is such a fair road that you really learn  nothing in that way; once get into a cross country, and you will see how  they get waggons down steep kloofs, across streams, and over rough  places.  No, you and Tom will stick to the waggons.  I have been fixing  a number of rings to-day underneath one of them, and your mother and the  women have been at work, making a sort of curtain to hook on all round;  so at night you will have a comfortable place to sleep in, for the  waggons will likely enough be so filled with cases and stores that there  will be no sleeping in them.  You can take the double-barrel as well as  your Winchester, as of an evening you may be able to get a shot  sometimes at game, which will vary your rations a bit.  You must take  with you a stock of tinned meats from Pieter-Maritzburg, for I do not  suppose they will issue regular rations to you.  So long as you are this  side of the Tugela, you will be able to buy food; but if the troops  cross into Zululand, you may have to depend on what you carry.\"    Tom with his two waggons arrived at daybreak, and the four teams set off  together, Mrs Humphreys--who had now completely lost her cough and was  quite strong and well--laying many injunctions upon Dick against  exposing himself to any danger, and Dick promising to be as careful as  possible.    Upon their arrival at Pieter-Maritzburg the boys went at once to the  government transport-yard, and on stating their errand were shown into  the office of the officer in charge.    \"We have brought down four teams of sixteen oxen each,\" Dick said, \"from  near Newcastle, to be hired to the government.\"    \"That is right, my lads,\" the officer said, \"we have room for plenty  more.  This is the form of contract.  You engage to serve the government  by the month; you bear any damages which may take place from wear and  tear of the roads, breakdowns, and the other ordinary accidents of  travel; the government engages to make good any loss or damage which may  occur from the action of the enemy.  This is not,\" he said, smiling,  \"likely to take place, but still those are the terms.  Have you any  authority from your fathers, to whom, I suppose, the teams belong, to  sign the contracts for them?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Dick said.  \"Here is a paper from my father, and one from  Tom Jackson's father, saying that they agree to be bound by the terms of  the contract, and that they authorise us to sign in their names.  We are  going with the waggons, sir, to look after the Kaffirs.\"    \"Well,\" the officer said, \"you can do as you like about that; but if you  speak Kaffir it will be useful--only, mind, you will have to provision  yourselves.  From the day the teams are taken up, rations of mealies  will be served to the Kaffirs at the various halting-places, but there  is no provision for rations of white men.  The cattle, too, will be fed,  but you will have to see to yourselves.\"    \"Yes, sir; we expected to do so.\"    \"Well, you had better fetch the teams up to the yard.  I must inspect  and pass them before they are taken up.  Bring them round at once; then  they will be loaded to-night, and start at daybreak to-morrow.\"    The teams were brought round to the yard, and immediately passed by the  officer, who indeed remarked upon the excellence of the animals.  The  Kaffirs were directed to outspan or unyoke the oxen, for whom rations of  hay and grain were at once issued.    The boys returned to the town and made their purchases, which were  carried down by two Kaffirs and stored in the waggons, which were  already in process of being loaded--two with boxes of ammunition, the  others with miscellaneous stores for the troops.  They slept at an  hotel, and next morning at daybreak presented themselves at the yard.  The Kaffirs were already harnessing up the oxen, and in a quarter of an  hour the four waggons, with sixteen others, started for the Tugela.    It was now the middle of December.  Early in the month commissioners had  been sent to Cetewayo with the terms decided upon by Sir Bartle Frere.  The first clauses of the document contained the settlement of the  disputed frontier, and fines were fixed to be paid by the chiefs whose  men had committed forays across the borders; it then went on to demand  that the whole of Cetewayo's army should at once be disbanded; freedom  of marriage was to be allowed, when the parties thereto were of age;  justice was to be impartially administered; missionaries to be allowed  to reside in the Zulu country; British residents to be appointed; all  disputes between Zulus and Europeans to be referred to the king and  resident; and no expulsion from Zulu territory was to be carried into  effect without the distinct approval of the resident.    It was intimated to the king that unless these terms were accepted by  the 11th of January the army would at once invade the country.  Few men  expected that the Zulu king would tamely submit to conditions which  would deprive him of all the military power in which he delighted, and  would reduce him to a state of something like dependency upon the  British.    During the month of December General Thesiger, who commanded the British  forces in South Africa, made every effort to prepare for hostilities.  The regiments which were at the Cape were brought round by sea; a  brigade of seamen and marines was landed from the ships of war; several  corps of irregular horse were raised among the colonists; and regiments  of natives were enrolled.  Before the date by which the king was to send  in his answer the troops were assembled along the frontier in the  following disposition:--      Number 1 Column.    (_Headquarters, Thring's Post, Lower Tugela_.)    Commandant.--Colonel C.K.  Pearson, the Buffs.      Naval Brigade.--170 bluejackets and marines of    H.M.S.  _Active_ (with one Gatling and two 7-pounder guns), under    Captain Campbell, R.N.      Royal Artillery.--Two 7-pounder guns and rocket-battery, under    Lieutenant W.N.  Lloyd, R.A.      Infantry.--2nd battalion, 3rd Buffs, under Lieutenant-Colonel H.    Parnell.      Mounted Infantry.--100 men under Captain Barrow, 19th Hussars.      Volunteers.--Durban Rifles, Natal Hussars, Stanger Rifles, Victoria    Rifles, Alexandra Rifles.  Average, forty men per corps--all mounted.      Native Contingent.--1000 men under Major Graves, the Buffs.      Number Two Column.    (_Headquarters, Helpmakaar, near"]]]
