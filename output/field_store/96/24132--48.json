The lady  hardly imagines what the end of the comedy will be.\"    Neither did Quennebert. It was an evening of adventures. It was written  that in the space of two hours Angelique was to run the gamut of all the  emotions, experience all the vicissitudes to which a life such as she  led is exposed: hope, fear, happiness, mortification, falsehood, love  that was no love, intrigue within intrigue, and, to crown all, a totally  unexpected conclusion.          CHAPTER V      The chevalier was still holding Angelique's hand when a step resounded  outside, and a voice was heard.    \"Can it be that he has come back?\" exclaimed the damsel, hastily freeing  herself from the passionate embrace of the chevalier. \"It's not  possible! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! it's his voice!\"    She grew pale to the lips, and stood staring at the door with  outstretched arms, unable to advance or recede.    The chevalier listened, but felt sure the approaching voice belonged  neither to the commander nor to the treasurer.    \"'His voice'?\" thought Quennebert to himself. \"Can this be yet another  aspirant to her favour?\"    The sound came nearer.    \"Hide yourself!\" said Angelique, pointing to a door opposite to the  partition behind which the widow and the notary were ensconced. \"Hide  yourself there!--there's a secret staircase--you can get out that way.\"    \"I hide myself!\" exclaimed Moranges, with a swaggering air. \"What are  you thinking of? I remain.\"    It would have been better for him to have followed her advice, as may  very well have occurred to the youth two minutes later, as a tall,  muscular young man entered in a state of intense excitement. Angelique  rushed to meet him, crying--    \"Ah! Monsieur le duc, is it you?\"    \"What is this I hear, Angelique?\" said the Duc de Vitry. \"I was told  below that three men had visited you this evening; but only two have  gone out--where is the third? Ha! I do not need long to find him,\" he  added, as he caught sight of the chevalier, who stood his ground bravely  enough.    \"In Heaven's name!\" cried Angelique,--\"in Heaven's name, listen to me!\"    \"No, no, not a word. Just now I am not questioning you. Who are you,  sir?\"    The chevalier's teasing and bantering disposition made him even at that  critical moment insensible to fear, so he retorted insolently--    \"Whoever I please to be, sir; and on my word I find the tone in which  you put your question delightfully amusing.\"    The duke sprang forward in a rage, laying his hand on his sword.  Angelique tried in vain to restrain him.    \"You want to screen him from my vengeance, you false one!\" said he,  retreating a few steps, so as to guard the door. \"Defend your life,  sir!\"    \"Do you defend yours!\"    Both drew at the same moment.    Two shrieks followed, one in the room, the other behind the tapestry,  for neither Angelique nor the widow had been able to restrain her alarm  as the two swords flashed in air. In fact the latter had been so  frightened that she fell heavily to the floor in a faint.    This incident probably saved the young man's life; his blood had already  begun to run cold at the sight of his adversary foaming with rage and  standing between him and the door, when the noise of the fall distracted  the duke's attention.    \"What was that?\" he cried. \"Are there other enemies concealed here too?\"  And forgetting that he was leaving a way of escape free, he rushed in  the direction from which the sound came, and lunged at the  tapestry-covered partition with his sword. Meantime the chevalier,  dropping all his airs of bravado, sprang from one end of the room to the  other like a cat pursued by a dog; but rapid as were his movements, the  duke perceived his flight, and dashed after him at the risk of breaking  both his own neck and the chevalier's by a chase through unfamiliar  rooms and down stairs which were plunged in darkness.    All this took place in a few seconds, like a flash of lightning. Twice,  with hardly any interval, the street door opened and shut noisily, and  the two enemies were in the street, one pursued and the other pursuing.    \"My God! Just to think of all that has happened is enough to make one  die of fright!\" said Mademoiselle de Guerchi. \"What will come next, I  should like to know? And what shall I say to the duke when he comes  back?\"    Just at this instant a loud cracking sound was heard in the room.  Angelique stood still, once more struck with terror, and recollecting  the cry she had heard. Her hair, which was already loosened, escaped  entirely from its bonds, and she felt it rise on her head as the figures  on the tapestry moved and bent towards her. Falling on her knees and  closing her eyes, she began to invoke the aid of God and all the saints.  But she soon felt herself raised by strong arms, and looking round, she  found herself in the presence of an unknown man, who seemed to have  issued from the ground or the walls, and who, seizing the only light  left unextinguished in the scuffle, dragged her more dead than alive  into the next room.    This man was, as the reader will have already guessed, Maitre  Quennebert. As soon as the chevalier and the duke had disappeared, the  notary had run towards the corner where the widow lay, and having made  sure that she was really unconscious, and unable to see or hear  anything, so that it would be quite safe to tell her any story he  pleased next day, he returned to his former position, and applying his  shoulder to the partition, easily succeeded in freeing the ends of the  rotten laths from the nails which held there, and, pushing them before  him, made an aperture large enough to allow of his passing through into  the next apartment. He applied himself to this task with such vigour,  and became so absorbed in its accomplishment, that he entirely forgot  the bag of twelve hundred livres which the widow had given him.    \"Who are you? What do you want with me?\" cried Mademoiselle de Guerchi,  struggling to free herself.    \"Silence!\" was Quennebert's answer.    \"Don't kill me, for pity's sake!\"    \"Who wants to kill you? But be silent; I don't want your shrieks to call  people here. I must be alone with you for a few moments. Once more I  tell you to be quiet, unless you want me to use violence. If you do what  I tell you, no harm shall happen to you.\"    \"But who are you, monsieur?\"    \"I am neither a burglar nor a murderer; that's all you need to know; the  rest is no concern of yours. Have you writing materials at hand?\"    \"Yes, monsieur; there they are, on that table.\"    \"Very well. Now sit down at the table.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Sit down, and answer my questions.\"    \"The first man who visited you this evening was M. Jeannin, was he not?\"    \"Yes, M. Jeannin de Castille.\"    \"The king's treasurer?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"All right. The second was Commander de Jars, and the young man he  brought with him was his nephew, the Chevalier de Moranges. The last  comer was a duke; am I not right?\"    \"The Duc de Vitry.\"    \"Now write from my dictation.\"    He spoke very slowly, and Mademoiselle de Guerchi, obeying his commands,  took up her pen.    \"'To-day,'\" dictated Quennebert,--\"'to-day, this twentieth day of the  month of November, in the year of the Lord 1658, I--    \"What is your full name?\"    \"Angelique-Louise de Guerchi.\"    \"Go on! 'I, Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, was visited, in the rooms  which--I occupy, in the mansion of the Duchesse d'Etampes, corner of the  streets Git-le-Coeur and du Hurepoix, about half-past seven o'clock in  the evening, in the first place, by Messire Jeannin de Castille, King's  Treasurer; in the second place, by Commander de Jars, who was  accompanied by a young man, his nephew, the Chevalier de Moranges; in  the third place, after the departure of Commander de Jars, and while I  was alone with the Chevalier de Moranges, by the Duc de Vitry, who drew  his sword upon the said chevalier and forced him to take flight.'    \"Now put in a line by itself, and use capitals \"'DESCRIPTION OF THE  CHEVALIER DE MORANGES.\"    \"But I only saw him for an instant,\" said Angelique, \"and I can't  recall----    \"Write, and don't talk. I can recall everything, and that is all that is  wanted.\"    \"'Height about five feet.' The chevalier,\" said Quennebert, interrupting  himself, \"is four feet eleven inches three lines and a half, but I don't  need absolute exactness.\" Angelique gazed at him in utter stupefaction.    \"Do you know him, then?\" she asked.    \"I saw him this evening for the first time, but my eye is very accurate.    \"'Height about five feet; hair black, eyes ditto, nose aquiline, mouth  large, lips compressed, forehead high, face oval, complexion pale, no  beard.'    \"Now another line, and in capitals: \"'SPECIAL MARKS.'    \"'A small mole on the neck behind the right ear, a smaller mole on the  left hand.'    \"Have you written that? Now sign it with your full name.\"    \"What use are you going to make of this paper?\"    \"I should have told you before, if I had desired you to know. Any  questions are quite useless. I don't enjoin secrecy on you, however,\"  added the notary, as he folded the paper and put it into his doublet  pocket. \"You are quite free to tell anyone you like that you have  written the description of the Chevalier de Moranges at the dictation of  an unknown man, who got into your room you don't know how, by the  chimney or through the ceiling perhaps, but who was determined to leave  it by a more convenient road. Is there not a secret staircase? Show me  where it is. I don't want to meet anyone on my way out.\"    Angelique pointed out a door to him hidden by a damask curtain, and  Quennebert saluting her, opened it and disappeared, leaving Angelique  convinced that she had seen the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#8)"],[1,"through the town, Charles was  always ambling by his side. He gave way to his whims, urged him to  extravagances, and inflamed his angry passions: in a word, he was the  good angel--or the bad one--who inspired his every thought and guided  his every action.    Joan soon understood this business, and as a fact had expected it. She  could have ruined Charles with a single word; but she scorned so base a  revenge, and treated him with utter contempt. Thus the court was split  into two factions: the Hungarians with Friar Robert at their head and  supported by Charles of Durazzo; on the other side all the nobility of  Naples, led by the Princes of Tarentum. Joan, influenced by the grand  seneschal's widow and her two daughters, the Countesses of Terlizzi and  Morcone, and also by Dona Cancha and the Empress of Constantinople, took  the side of the Neapolitan party against the pretensions of her husband.  The partisans of the queen made it their first care to have her name  inscribed upon all public acts without adding Andre's; but Joan, led by  an instinct of right and justice amid all the corruption of her court,  had only consented to this last after she had taken counsel with Andre  d'Isernia, a very learned lawyer of the day, respected as much for his  lofty character as for his great learning. The prince, annoyed at being  shut out in this way, began to act in a violent and despotic manner. On  his own authority he released prisoners; he showered favours upon  Hungarians, and gave especial honours and rich gifts to Giovanni Pipino,  Count of Altanuera, the enemy of all others most dreaded and detested by  the Neapolitan barons. Then the Counts of San Severino, Mileto, Terlizzi  and Balzo, Calanzaro and Sant' Angelo, and most of the grandees,  exasperated by the haughty insolence of Andre's favourite, which grew  every day more outrageous, decided that he must perish, and his master  with him, should he persist in attacking their privileges and defying  their anger.    Moreover, the women who were about Joan at the court egged her on, each  one urged by a private interest, in the pursuit of her fresh passion.  Poor Joan,--neglected by her husband and betrayed by Robert of Cabane--  gave way beneath the burden of duties beyond her strength to bear, and  fled for refuge to the arms of Bertrand of Artois, whose love she did  not even attempt to resist; for every feeling for religion and virtue  had been destroyed in her own set purpose, and her young inclinations  had been early bent towards vice, just as the bodies of wretched  children are bent and their bones broken by jugglers when they train  them. Bertrand himself felt an adoration for her surpassing ordinary  human passion. When he reached the summit of a happiness to which in his  wildest dreams he had never dared to aspire, the young count nearly lost  his reason. In vain had his father, Charles of Artois (who was Count of  Aire, a direct descendant of Philip the Bold, and one of the regents of  the kingdom), attempted by severe admonitions to stop him while yet on  the brink of the precipice: Bertrand would listen to nothing but his  love for Joan and his implacable hatred for all the queen's enemies.  Many a time, at the close of day, as the breeze from Posilippo or  Sorrento coming from far away was playing in his hair, might Bertrand be  seen leaning from one of the casements of Castel Nuovo, pale and  motionless, gazing fixedly from his side of the square to where the Duke  of Calabria and the Duke of Durazzo came galloping home from their  evening ride side by side in a cloud of dust. Then the brows of the  young count were violently contracted, a savage, sinister look shone in  his blue eyes once so innocent, like lightning a thought of death and  vengeance flashed into his mind; he would all at once begin to tremble,  as a light hand was laid upon his shoulder; he would turn softly,  fearing lest the divine apparition should vanish to the skies; but there  beside him stood a young girl, with cheeks aflame and heaving breast,  with brilliant liquid eyes: she had come to tell how her past day had  been spent, and to offer her forehead for the kiss that should reward  her labours and unwilling absence. This woman, dictator of laws and  administrator of justice among grave magistrates and stern ministers,  was but fifteen years old; this man; who knew her griefs, and to avenge  them was meditating regicide, was not yet twenty: two children of earth,  the playthings of an awful destiny!    Two months and a few days after the old king's death, on the morning of  Friday the 28th of March of the same year, 1343, the widow of the grand  seneschal, Philippa, who, had already contrived to get forgiven for the  shameful trick she had used to secure all her son's wishes, entered the  queen's apartments, excited by a genuine fear, pale and distracted, the  bearer of news that spread terror and lamentation throughout the court:  Marie, the queen's younger sister, had disappeared.    The gardens and outside courts had been searched for any trace of her;  every corner of the castle had been examined; the guards had been  threatened with torture, so as to drag the truth from them; no one had  seen anything of the princess, and nothing could be found that suggested  either flight or abduction. Joan, struck down by this new blow in the  midst of other troubles, was for a time utterly prostrated; then, when  she had recovered from her first surprise, she behaved as all people do  if despair takes the place of reason: she gave orders for what was  already done to be done again, she asked the same questions that could  only bring the same answers, and poured forth vain regrets and unjust  reproaches. The news spread through the town, causing the greatest  astonishment: there arose a great commotion in the castle, and the  members of the regency hastily assembled, while couriers were sent out  in every direction, charged to promise 12,000 ducats to whomsoever  should discover the place where the princess was concealed. Proceedings  were at once taken against the soldiers who were on guard at the  fortress at the time of the disappearance.    Bertrand of Artois drew the queen apart, telling her his suspicions,  which fell directly upon Charles of Durazzo; but Joan lost no time in  persuading him of the improbability of his hypothesis: first of all,  Charles had never once set his foot in Castel Nuovo since the day of his  stormy interview with the queen, but had made a point of always leaving  Andre by the bridge when he came to the town with him; besides, it had  never been noticed, even in the past, that the young duke had spoken to  Marie or exchanged looks with her: the result of all attainable evidence  was that no stranger had entered the castle the evening before except a  notary named Master Nicholas of Melazzo, an old person, half silly, half  fanatical, for whom Tommaso Pace, valet de chambre to the Duke of  Calabria, was ready to answer with his life. Bertrand yielded to the  queen's reasoning, and day by day advanced new suggestions, each less  probable than the last, to draw his mistress on to feel a hope that he  was far from feeling himself.    But a month later, and precisely on the morning of Monday the 30th of  April, a strange and unexpected scene took place, an exhibition of  boldness transcending all calculations. The Neapolitan people were  stupefied in astonishment, and the grief of Joan and her friends was  changed to indignation. Just as the clock of San Giovanni struck twelve,  the gate of the magnificent palace of the Durazzo flung open its folding  doors, and there came forth to the sound of trumpets a double file of  cavaliers on richly caparisoned horses, with the duke's arms on their  shields. They took up their station round the house to prevent the  people outside from disturbing a ceremony which was to take place before  the eyes of an immense crowd, assembled suddenly, as by a miracle, upon  the square. At the back of the court stood an altar, and upon the steps  lay two crimson velvet cushions embroidered with the fleur-de-lys of  France and the ducal crown. Charles came forward, clad in a dazzling  dress, and holding by the hand the queen's sister, the Princess Marie,  at that time almost thirteen years of age. She knelt down timidly on one  of the cushions, and when Charles had done the same, the grand almoner  of the Duras house asked the young duke solemnly what was his intention  in appearing thus humbly before a minister of the Church. At these words  Master Nicholas of Melazzo took his place on the left of the altar, and  read in a firm, clear voice, first, the contract of marriage between  Charles and Marie, and then the apostolic letters from His Holiness the  sovereign pontiff, Clement VI, who in his own name removing all  obstacles that might impede the union, such as the age of the young  bride and the degrees of affinity between the two parties, authorised  his dearly beloved son Charles, Duke of Durazzo and Albania, to take in  marriage the most illustrious Marie of Anjou, sister of Joan, Queen of  Naples and Jerusalem, and bestowed his benediction on the pair.    The almoner then took the young girl's hand, and placing it in that of  Charles, pronounced the prayers of the Church. Charles, turning half  round to the people, said in a loud voice--    \"Before God and man, this woman is my wife.\"    \"And this man is my husband,\" said Marie, trembling.    \"Long live the Duke and Duchess of Durazzo!\" cried the crowd, clapping  their hands. And the young pair, at once mounting two beautiful horses  and followed by their cavaliers and pages, solemnly paraded through the  town, and re-entered their palace to the sound of trumpets and cheering.    When this incredible news was brought to the queen, her first feeling  was joy at the recovery of her sister; and when Bertrand of Artois was  eager to head a band of barons and"]]]
