[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#8)"],[1,"an underlying     seriousness and intelligence are essential. One should use just enough     jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as a member of     the culture; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho     attitude is considered tacky and the mark of a loser.       This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally     spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical     fields. In contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is     fairly constant throughout hackerdom.       It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative     questions -- or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking     are often confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that     they have done so much programming that distinguishes between  if (going) ...       and  if (!going) ...       that when they parse the question \"Aren't you going?\" it may seem to     be asking the opposite question from \"Are you going?\", and so to merit     an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking     non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative     part weren't there. In some other languages (including Russian,     Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the     problem wouldn't arise. Hackers often find themselves wishing for a     word like French `si', German `doch', or Dutch `jawel' - a word with     which one could unambiguously answer `yes' to a negative question.     (See also [136]mu)       For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double     negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows     them. The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an     affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to     disturb them.       In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering     questions containing logical connectives with a strictly literal     rather than colloquial interpretation. A non-hacker who is indelicate     enough to ask a question like \"So, are you working on finding that bug     now or leaving it until later?\" is likely to get the perfectly correct     answer \"Yes!\" (that is, \"Yes, I'm doing it either now or later, and     you didn't ask which!\").       _________________________________________________________________       Node:International Style, Next:[137]Lamer-speak, Previous:[138]Hacker     Speech Style, Up:[139]Top    International Style       Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage     in American English, we have made some effort to get input from     abroad. Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses     translations of jargon from English (often as transmitted to them by     earlier Jargon File versions!), the local variations are interesting,     and knowledge of them may be of some use to travelling hackers.       There are some references herein to `Commonwealth hackish'. These are     intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in     the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada,     Australia, India, etc. -- though Canada is heavily influenced by     American usage). There is also an entry on [140]Commonwealth Hackish     reporting some general phonetic and vocabulary differences from U.S.     hackish.       Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia report that     they often use a mixture of English and their native languages for     technical conversation. Occasionally they develop idioms in their     English usage that are influenced by their native-language styles.     Some of these are reported here.       On the other hand, English often gives rise to grammatical and     vocabulary mutations in the native language. For example, Italian     hackers often use the nonexistent verbs `scrollare' (to scroll) and     `deletare' (to delete) rather than native Italian `scorrere' and     `cancellare'. Similarly, the English verb `to hack' has been seen     conjugated in Swedish. In German, many Unix terms in English are     casually declined as if they were German verbs - thus:     mount/mounten/gemountet; grep/grepen/gegrept; fork/forken/geforkt;     core dump/core-dumpen, core-gedumpt. And Spanish-speaking hackers use     `linkar' (to link), `debugear' (to debug), and `lockear' (to lock).       European hackers report that this happens partly because the English     terms make finer distinctions than are available in their native     vocabularies, and partly because deliberate language-crossing makes     for amusing wordplay.       A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they     are parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to     English-speakers.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Lamer-speak, Next:[141]Pronunciation Guide,     Previous:[142]International Style, Up:[143]Top    Crackers, Phreaks, and Lamers       From the early 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local,     MS-DOS-based bulletin boards developed separately from Internet     hackerdom. The BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a stratum of     `pirate boards' inhabited by [144]crackers, phone phreaks, and     [145]warez d00dz. These people (mostly teenagers running IBM-PC clones     from their bedrooms) have developed their own characteristic jargon,     heavily influenced by skateboard lingo and underground-rock slang.       Though crackers often call themselves `hackers', they aren't (they     typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet     expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems).     Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's. Nevertheless,     this lexicon covers much of it so the reader will be able to     understand what goes by on bulletin-board systems.       Here is a brief guide to cracker and [146]warez d00dz usage:       * Misspell frequently. The substitutions       phone => fone       freak => phreak         are obligatory.       * Always substitute `z's for `s's. (i.e. \"codes\" -> \"codez\"). The         substitution of 'z' for 's' has evolved so that a 'z' is bow         systematically put at the end of words to denote an illegal or         cracking connection. Examples : Appz, passwordz, passez, utilz,         MP3z, distroz, pornz, sitez, gamez, crackz, serialz, downloadz,         FTPz, etc.       * Type random emphasis characters after a post line (i.e. \"Hey         Dudes!#!$#$!#!$\").       * Use the emphatic `k' prefix (\"k-kool\", \"k-rad\", \"k-awesome\")         frequently.       * Abbreviate compulsively (\"I got lotsa warez w/ docs\").       * Substitute `0' for `o' (\"r0dent\", \"l0zer\").       * TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE         TIME.       These traits are similar to those of [147]B1FF, who originated as a     parody of naive [148]BBS users; also of his latter-day equivalent     [149]Jeff K.. Occasionally, this sort of distortion may be used as     heavy sarcasm by a real hacker, as in:      > I got X Windows running under Linux!        d00d!  u R an 31337 hax0r       The only practice resembling this in actual hacker usage is the     substitution of a dollar sign of `s' in names of products or service     felt to be excessively expensive, e.g. Compu$erve, Micro$oft.       For further discussion of the pirate-board subculture, see [150]lamer,     [151]elite, [152]leech, [153]poser, [154]cracker, and especially     [155]warez d00dz, [156]banner site, [157]ratio site, [158]leech mode.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Pronunciation Guide, Next:[159]Other Lexicon Conventions,     Previous:[160]Lamer-speak, Up:[161]Top                                How to Use the Lexicon    Pronunciation Guide       Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all entries     that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English     nor obvious compounds thereof. Slashes bracket phonetic     pronunciations, which are to be interpreted using the following     conventions:      1. Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an accent or         back-accent follows each accented syllable (the back-accent marks         a secondary accent in some words of four or more syllables). If no         accent is given, the word is pronounced with equal accentuation on         all syllables (this is common for abbreviations).      2. Consonants are pronounced as in American English. The letter `g'         is always hard (as in \"got\" rather than \"giant\"); `ch' is soft         (\"church\" rather than \"chemist\"). The letter `j' is the sound that         occurs twice in \"judge\". The letter `s' is always as in \"pass\",         never a z sound. The digraph `kh' is the guttural of \"loch\" or         \"l'chaim\". The digraph 'gh' is the aspirated g+h of \"bughouse\" or         \"ragheap\" (rare in English).      3. Uppercase letters are pronounced as their English letter names;         thus (for example) /H-L-L/ is equivalent to /aych el el/. /Z/ may         be pronounced /zee/ or /zed/ depending on your local dialect.      4. Vowels are represented as follows:            /a/                  back, that            /ah/                  father, palm (see note)            /ar/                  far, mark            /aw/                  flaw, caught            /ay/                  bake, rain            /e/                  less, men            /ee/                  easy, ski            /eir/                  their, software            /i/                  trip, hit            /i:/                  life, sky            /o/                  block, stock (see note)            /oh/                  flow, sew            /oo/                  loot, through            /or/                  more, door            /ow/                  out, how            /oy/                  boy, coin    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3013"],[0,"The Birds (#8)"],[1," we here? Where did you come from, tell me? Who  are you?    POET I am he whose language is sweeter than honey, the zealous slave of  the Muses, as Homer has it.    PISTHETAERUS You a slave! and yet you wear your hair long?    POET No, but the fact is all we poets are the assiduous slaves of the  Muses, according to Homer.    PISTHETAERUS In truth your little cloak is quite holy too through zeal!  But, poet, what ill wind drove you here?    POET I have composed verses in honour of your Nephelococcygia, a host of  splendid dithyrambs and parthenians(1) worthy of Simonides himself.      f(1) Verses sung by maidens.    PISTHETAERUS And when did you compose them? How long since?    POET Oh! 'tis long, aye, very long, that I have sung in honour of this  city.    PISTHETAERUS But I am only celebrating its foundation with this  sacrifice;(1) I have only just named it, as is done with little babies.      f(1) This ceremony took place on the tenth day after birth, and may be  styled the pagan baptism.    POET \"Just as the chargers fly with the speed of the wind, so does the  voice of the Muses take its flight. Oh! thou noble founder of the town  of Aetna,(1) thou, whose name recalls the holy sacrifices,(2) make us  such gift as thy generous heart shall suggest.\"      f(1) Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse.--This passage is borrowed from Pindar.      f(2) (Hiero) in Greek means 'sacrifice.'    PISTHETAERUS He will drive us silly if we do not get rid of him by some  present. Here! you, who have a fur as well as your tunic, take it off  and give it to this clever poet. Come, take this fur; you look to me to  be shivering with cold.    POET My Muse will gladly accept this gift; but engrave these verses of  Pindar's on your mind.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! what a pest! 'Tis impossible then to be rid of him!    POET \"Straton wanders among the Scythian nomads, but has no linen  garment. He is sad at only wearing an animal's pelt and no tunic.\" Do  you conceive my bent?    PISTHETAERUS I understand that you want me to offer you a tunic. Hi!  you (TO EUELPIDES), take off yours; we must help the poet.... Come, you,  take it and begone.    POET I am going, and these are the verses that I address to this city:  \"Phoebus of the golden throne, celebrate this shivery, freezing city;  I have travelled through fruitful and snow-covered plains. Tralala!  Tralala!\"(1)      f(1) A parody of poetic pathos, not to say bathos.    PISTHETAERUS What are you chanting us about frosts? Thanks to the tunic,  you no longer fear them. Ah! by Zeus! I could not have believed this  cursed fellow could so soon have learnt the way to our city. Come,  priest, take the lustral water and circle the altar.    PRIEST Let all keep silence!    A PROPHET Let not the goat be sacrificed.(1)      f(1) Which the priest was preparing to sacrifice.    PISTHETAERUS Who are you?    PROPHET Who am I? A prophet.    PISTHETAERUS Get you gone.    PROPHET Wretched man, insult not sacred things. For there is an oracle  of Bacis, which exactly applies to Nephelococcygia.    PISTHETAERUS Why did you not reveal it to me before I founded my city?    PROPHET The divine spirit was against it.    PISTHETAERUS Well, 'tis best to know the terms of the oracle.    PROPHET \"But when the wolves and the white crows shall dwell together  between Corinth and Sicyon...\"    PISTHETAERUS But how do the Corinthians concern me?    PROPHET 'Tis the regions of the air that Bacis indicated in this manner.  \"They must first sacrifice a white-fleeced goat to Pandora, and give the  prophet, who first reveals my words, a good cloak and new sandals.\"    PISTHETAERUS Are the sandals there?    PROPHET Read. \"And besides this a goblet of wine and a good share of the  entrails of the victim.\"    PISTHETAERUS Of the entrails--is it so written?    PROPHET Read. \"If you do as I command, divine youth, you shall be an  eagle among the clouds; if not, you shall be neither turtle-dove, nor  eagle, nor woodpecker.\"    PISTHETAERUS Is all that there?    PROPHET Read.    PISTHETAERUS This oracle in no sort of way resembles the one Apollo  dictated to me: \"If an impostor comes without invitation to annoy you  during the sacrifice and to demand a share of the victim, apply a stout  stick to his ribs.\"    PROPHET You are drivelling.    PISTHETAERUS \"And don't spare him, were he an eagle from out of the  clouds, were it Lampon(1) himself or the great Diopithes.\"(2)      f(1) Noted Athenian diviner, who, when the power was still shared  between Thucydides and Pericles, predicted that it would soon be centred  in the hands of the latter; his ground for this prophecy was the sight  of a ram with a single horn.    f(2) No doubt another Athenian diviner, and possibly the same person  whom Aristophanes names in 'The Knights' and 'The Wasps' as being a  thief.    PROPHET Is all that there?    PISTHETAERUS Here, read it yourself, and go and hang yourself.    PROPHET Oh! unfortunate wretch that I am.    PISTHETAERUS Away with you, and take your prophecies elsewhere.    METON(1) I have come to you.      f(1) A celebrated geometrician and astronomer.    PISTHETAERUS Yet another pest! What have you come to do? What's your  plan? What's the purpose of your journey? Why these splendid buskins?    METON I want to survey the plains of the air for you and to parcel them  into lots.    PISTHETAERUS In the name of the gods, who are you?    METON Who am I? Meton, known throughout Greece and at Colonus.(1)      f(1) A deme contiguous to Athens. It is as though he said, \"Well known  throughout all England and at Croydon.    PISTHETAERUS What are these things?    METON Tools for measuring the air. In truth, the spaces in the air have  precisely the form of a furnace. With this bent ruler I draw a line  from top to bottom; from one of its points I describe a circle with the  compass. Do you understand?    PISTHETAERUS Not the very least.    METON With the straight ruler I set to work to inscribe a square within  this circle; in its centre will be the market-place, into which all  the straight streets will lead, converging to this centre like a star,  which, although only orbicular, sends forth its rays in a straight line  from all sides.    PISTHETAERUS Meton, you new Thales...(1)      f(1) Thales was no less famous as a geometrician than he was as a sage.    METON What d'you want with me?    PISTHETAERUS I want to give you a proof of my friendship. Use your legs.    METON Why, what have I to fear?    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis the same here as in Sparta. Strangers are driven away,  and blows rain down as thick as hail.    METON Is there sedition in your city?    PISTHETAERUS No, certainly not.    METON What's wrong then?    PISTHETAERUS We are agreed to sweep all quacks and impostors far from  our borders.    METON Then I'm off.    PISTHETAERUS I fear 'tis too late. The thunder growls already. (BEATS  HIM.)    METON Oh, woe! oh, woe!    PISTHETAERUS I warned you. Now, be off, and do your surveying somewhere  else. (METON TAKES TO HIS HEELS.)    AN INSPECTOR Where are the Proxeni?(1)      f(1) Officers of Athens, whose duty was to protect strangers who came on  political or other business, and see to their interests generally.    PISTHETAERUS Who is this Sardanapalus?(1)      f(1) He addresses the inspector thus because of the royal and  magnificent manners he assumes.    INSPECTOR I have been appointed by lot to come to Nephelococcygia as  inspector.(1)      f(1) Magistrates appointed to inspect the tributary towns.    PISTHETAERUS An inspector! and who sends you here, you rascal?    INSPECTOR A decree of T(e)leas.(1)      f(1) A much-despised citizen, already mentioned. He ironically supposes  him invested with the powers of an Archon, which ordinarily were  entrusted only to men of good repute.    PISTHETAERUS Will you just pocket your salary, do nothing, and be off?    INSPECTOR I' faith! that I will; I am urgently needed to be at Athens  to attend the assembly; for I am charged with the interests of  Pharnaces.(1)      f(1) A Persian satrap.--An allusion to certain orators, who, bribed with  Asiatic gold, had often defended the interests of the foe in the Public  Assembly.    PISTHETAERUS Take it then, and be off. See, here is your salary. (BEATS  HIM.)    INSPECTOR What does this mean?    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis the assembly where you have to defend Pharnaces.    INSPECTOR You shall testify that they dare to strike me, the inspector.    PISTHETAERUS Are you not going to clear out with your urns? 'Tis not  to be believed; they send us inspectors before we have so much as paid  sacrifice to the gods.    A DEALER IN DECREES \"If the Nephelococcygian does wrong to the  Athenian...\"    PISTHETAERUS Now whatever are these cursed parchments?    DEALER IN DECREES I am a dealer in decrees, and I have come here to sell  you the new laws.    PISTHETAERUS Which?    DEALER IN DECREES \"The Nephelococcygians shall adopt the same weights,  measures and decrees as the Olophyxians.\"(1)      f(1) A Macedonian people in the peninsula of Chalcidice. This name is  chosen because of its similarity to the Greek word (for) 'to groan.' It  is from another verb, meaning the same thing, that Pisthetaerus coins  the name of Ototyxians, i.e. groaners, because he is about to beat the  dealer.--The mother-country had the right to impose any law it chose  upon its colonies.    PISTHETAERUS And you shall soon be imitating the Ototyxians. (BEATS  HIM.)    DEALER IN DECREES Hullo! what are you doing?    PISTHETAERUS Now will you be off with your decrees? For I am going to  let YOU see some severe ones.    INSPECTOR (RETURNING) I summon Pisthetaerus for outrage for the month of  Munychion.(1)      f(1) Corresponding to our month of April.    PISTHETAERUS Ha! my friend! are you still there?    DEALER IN DECREES \"Should anyone drive away the magistrates and not  receive them, according to the decree duly posted...\"    PISTHETAERUS What! rascal! you are there too?    INSPECTOR Woe to you!
