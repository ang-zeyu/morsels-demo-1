All ideas of  reform have been met with suspicion--a kind of suspicion that,  though now confined to the Boers, was very prevalent in Europe a  hundred years ago. The present writer in extreme youth met here, in  advanced England, a grandam of ninety (the mother of a very  distinguished politician), who stated that she could \"never make a  friend of a man who took a bath.\" It will be seen by this how  prejudice may become a matter of habit all the world over.    Mr. Nixon tells a story of an equally conservative Boer. This worthy  went to a store at Kimberley with bundles of tobacco for sale. The  Boer carefully weighed them out with some scales of his own that  were evidently an heirloom. The storekeeper reweighed the bundles,  remarking on the antiquity of the scales, and observing that they  gave short weight. He suggested the use of the store scales as the  standard for computing the price, which was to be fixed at so much a  pound. But the Boer would not hear of it. \"No,\" said he, \"these were  my father's scales, and he was a wise man and was never cheated, and  I won't use anybody else's.\" The storekeeper dryly remarked that he  did not desire to press the matter, since he found himself a gainer  by L12 in consequence of the Boer's conservative instincts!    Many writers urge that the Boer is naturally uncivil, that he lacks  the true feeling of hospitality. The original Boer, before he was  seized with a hatred for the British, was more justly speaking  lacking in civility than what we term uncivil. He knew nothing of  the art of being obliging to his fellow-creatures, merely because  they were his fellow-creatures. He would entertain a stranger, and  ask nothing in return, but he would do so without courtesy, and  would put himself out of the way for no one. The traveller might  take him or leave him, conform to his hours and habits entirely,  and, to use the vulgar phrase, \"like them or lump them\" as his  temperament might decide. \"Africanus,\" who, in his book on \"The  Transvaal Boers,\" writes of them with judgment and without  prejudice, gives a very true sketch, which exactly describes the  strange blend of piety, indolence, ignorance, and ferocity which we  are endeavouring to study. He says--    \"The Dutch farmer is in some respects very unlike his supposed  counterpart in England. His pursuits are pastoral, not agricultural,  for in most parts of South Africa the want of irrigation renders the  cultivation of cereals impossible. His idea of a 'farm' is a tract  of at least 6000 acres, over which his flocks and herds can move  from one pasture to another. His labourers are all natives, and  though, before the advent of storekeepers, he used often to make his  own clothes, boots (veld-schoen), and harness, he looks on actual  farm-work as a menial pursuit. He was, and is, wont to pass whole  days in the saddle, but, to an English eye, his horses seem unkempt  and often ill-used. The magnificent herds of game which wandered  over South Africa sixty years ago tempted him to become a keen  sportsman, but he has never shown much 'sporting instinct,' and the  Boer is responsible for the wanton destruction of the African fauna.  The unsophisticated Boer is a curious blend of hospitality and  avarice; he would welcome the passing stranger, and entertain him to  the best of his ability, but he seized any opportunity of making  money, and the discovery that hides and skins were marketable  induced him to slaughter antelopes without the slightest  forethought. That the Boer is no longer hospitable is very largely  due to the way in which his hospitality has been abused by stray  pedlars and ne'er-do-wells of various kinds. He still retains a  sincere and primitive piety, but his belief that he is a member of  the chosen people has sometimes tended to antinomianism rather than  to strict morality. His contempt and dislike for the Kaffir has  preserved the Dutch stock from taint of black blood, and although  there is a large Eur-African population, it has sprung partly from  the old days of domestic slavery, partly from the laxity induced by  the recent influx of low-class Europeans. The Boer has a strong  national feeling, and although not exactly daring as a rule, he is  perfectly ready to risk his life in what he believes to be a good  cause. He fights better behind cover than in the open, and has a  profound contempt for soldiers who expose themselves unnecessarily.  At the same time, he is capable at times of embarking on a forlorn  hope. As regards his private character, his notions of honesty and  of truth are lax. But then, from bitter experience, he assumes that  the stranger will try to cheat him, and it is not surprising that he  should consider a certain amount of _finesse_ justifiable. He is  comparatively free from that drunkenness which is the besetting vice  of the low-class Englishman in Africa.    \"Although he is incredibly ignorant, and very self-satisfied, it is  somewhat irritating to notice the way in which the town-bred  Englishman is apt to depreciate him. It is not so certain as the  latter thinks that an ignorant peasant is necessarily a lower type  of man than a 'smart' and vicious shop-boy.    \"The most unpleasing trait in the Boer character is his callousness,  amounting to brutality, in the case of natives and of animals.\"    It must always be remembered that in discussing the early Boer we  are discussing the peasant, and that neither his ignorance nor other  shortcomings must be viewed in comparison with the failings of  persons of a higher social grade. When the Boers left the Cape  Colony they had no knowledge of what the word education meant. The  state of public education in 1837 was deplorable. There were  missionary schools and a few desultory teachers, who had in very few  cases the mental or the moral qualities to fit them for the task of  instruction. The most they did was to teach the young idea how to  read or scribble its name. For this they received trifling fees, but  doubtless these fees were no more trifling than the services  rendered. Such free schools as existed, and were nominally supported  by Government, were so indifferently managed that they were treated  with contempt, even by the farmers. So long as they could thumb out  their favourite passages of the Psalms, and sign what few documents  they required, they were content. Of their ignorance they were even  inclined to be proud. Their own notions of geography and history  seemed to them infinitely preferable to any that might be offered,  and in this state of blissful ignorance they trekked away from Cape  Colony to learn no more. When they started forth, some, it is  averred, imagined by steadily working north they would reach  Jerusalem; others, covered with faith, and armed with gospel and  sjambok, sincerely believed that eventually they would reach the  Promised Land.          CHAPTER II    THE ORANGE FREE STATE      The young State, almost before it was fledged, found itself engaged  in military operations with the Basutos, and an arbitrator nominated  by the British Government was appointed. But the good offices of the  commissioner were to no purpose; despite the defining of boundaries  and the laying down of landmarks, the natives broke out afresh. An  engagement followed, and the Basutos were defeated. As a  consequence, a large tract of land (the conquered territory) was  annexed by the Free State, yet even this was insufficient to quell  the fury of the farmer's inveterate foes, and later on they broke  out afresh, only to be again overthrown. In the year 1861 they  appealed for help to the Governor of the Cape and were declared  British subjects. It was then that a definite boundary line between  Basutoland and the Orange Free State was laid down. The population  of Basutoland is estimated at about 130,000. The people are by  nature warlike and energetic. Some authorities declare them to be  the most intelligent of the Kaffir tribes. They are a branch of the  Bechuana race who were formed by their chiefs, Motlune and Moshesh,  and held their country--the Switzerland of South Africa--against  both Zulu and Boer. This aggressive and ferocious tribe was devoted  to plunder, and remained well-nigh exempt from punishment in  consequence of its mountain fastnesses, which were almost  impregnable. The Basutos formed a continual menace to the Boers of  the Free State until Great Britain assumed their direct control in  1884. It is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the High  Commissioner for South Africa. It is divided into seven districts,  and subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied  to the Moshesh family. Laws are made by proclamation of the High  Commissioner, and administered by native chiefs. Europeans are not  allowed to settle there.    But to return to 1854. The relations between the two Boer States  soon became strained. Jealousy commenced and continued to simmer.  Then the Boers, alarmed lest the Government would again follow them  up, and lest their treatment of the natives should be investigated  and stopped, began to discourage the presence of visitors across the  Vaal. Of course missionaries were the most unwelcome of all.    With the terms of the Sand River Convention they had soon become  impatient, and to help to an understanding of this impatience some  of the Articles of the Convention may be quoted:--    _Article 1._--\"The Assistant-Commissioners guarantee in the fullest  manner on the part of the British Government to the emigrant farmers  beyond the Vaal River the right to manage their own affairs, and to  govern themselves according to their own laws, without any  interference on the part of the British Government, and that no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#8)"],[1,"mate. The  consequence was that the gold brought to the United States mint for  coinage fell off year by year, until some of the years between 1820 and  1830 it had been almost zero. Gold money had nearly ceased to circulate.    [1834-1836]    Jackson resolved to restore the yellow metal to daily use. In this he  was opposed by many Whigs, who, so zealous were they for the United  States Bank, had become paper money men. The so-called Gold Bill was  carried through Congress in 1834, changing the proportion of silver to  gold in our currency from fifteen to one to sixteen to one. It should  have been fifteen and a half to one. Now gold in its turn was  over-valued, so that silver gradually ceased to circulate, as gold had  almost ceased before. This result was made worse after 1848, when there  was a still further appreciation of silver through the discovery of gold  in California and Australia. Silver dollars did not again circulate  freely in the country until 1878, though they were full legal tender  till 1873. Gold, on the other hand, was everywhere seen after 1834,  though not abundant in circulation, owing to the large amounts of paper  money then in use.    In 1836 the President ordered his Secretary of the Treasury to put forth  the famous Specie Circular, declaring that only gold, silver, or land  scrip should be received in payment for public lands. The occasion of  this was that while land sales were very rapidly increasing, the  receipts hitherto had consisted largely in the notes of insolvent banks.  Land speculators would organize a bank, procure for it, if they could,  the favor of being a \"pet\" bank, issue notes, borrow these as  individuals and buy land with them. The notes were deposited, when they  would borrow them again to buy land with, and so on. As there was little  specie in the West, the circular broke up many a fine plan, and evoked  much ill-feeling. Gold was drawn from the East, where, as many of the  banks had none too much, the drain caused not a few of them to collapse.  The condition of business at this time was generally unsound, and this  westward movement of gold was all that was needed to precipitate a  crisis. A crisis accordingly came on soon after, painfully severe. It is  unfair, however, to arraign Jackson's order as wholly responsible for  the evils which accompanied this monetary cataclysm. It was rather an  occasion than the cause.        CHAPTER VI.    THE FIRST WHIG TRIUMPH    [1837]    Partly Jackson's personal influence, partly his able aides, partly  favoring circumstances had, during his administrations, brought the  Democracy into excellent condition, patriotic, national in general  spirit, with a creed that, however imperfect--close construction being  its integrating idea--was, after all, definite, consistent, and  thoughtful. Yet in 1840 the Democrats, who four years before had chosen  Van Buren by an electoral vote of 170 to 73, had to surrender, with the  same Van Buren for candidate, to the Whigs by a majority of 234  electoral votes to 60; only five States, and but two of them northern,  going for the democratic candidate.    There were several causes for this defeat. Jackson had made many enemies  as well as many friends, some of these within his own party, while the  entire opposition to him was indescribably bitter on account of the  personal element entering into the struggle. The commendably national  spirit of the Whig Party told well in its favor. Upon this point its  attitude proved far more in accord with the best sentiment of the nation  than that of the Democracy, sound as the latter was at the core and  nobly as its chief had behaved in the nullification crisis.    More influential still was the financial predicament into which on  Jackson's retirement his successor and the country were plunged. The  commercial distress which seemed to spring from Jackson's measures was  now first fully realized. Anger and pain from the death of the bank had  not abated. Ardent hatred prevailed toward the \"pet\" banks, extending to  the party whose darlings they were, while the Specie Circular was held  to have ruined most of the others. The subsequent legislation for  distributing the treasury surplus among the States, by removing the  deposits from the pet banks, destroyed many of these as well. They had  been using this government money for the discount of loans to business  men, and were not in condition instantly to pay it back. Hence the panic  of 1837. First the New York City banks suspended, soon followed by the  others throughout that State, all sustained in their course by an act of  the Legislature. Suspension presently occurred everywhere else. The  financial pressure continued through the entire summer of 1837, banks,  corporations, and business men going to the wall, and all values greatly  sinking. Boston suffered one hundred and sixty-eight business failures  in six months.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Martin Van Buren.  From a photograph by Brady.      One of Van Buren's earliest acts after assuming office was to call an  extra session of Congress for September 4, 1837, to consider the  financial condition of the country. When it convened, an increase of the  whig vote was apparent, though the Democrats were still in the majority.  On the President's recommendation, agitation now began in favor of the  sub-treasury or independent treasury plan, still in use to-day, of  keeping the government moneys. This had been first broached in 1834-35  by Whigs. The Democrats then opposed it; but now they took it up as a  means of counteracting the whig purpose to revive a national bank.    There was soon less need of any such special arrangement, as the  treasury was swiftly running dry. In June of the preceding year, 1836,  both parties concurring, an act had passed providing that after January  1, 1837, all surplus revenue should be distributed to the States in  proportion to their electoral votes. It was meant to be a loan, to be  recalled, however, only by vote of Congress, but it proved a donation.  Twenty-eight millions were thus paid in all, never to return. Such a  disposition of the revenue had now to be stopped and reverse action  instituted. Importers called for time on their revenue bonds, which had  to be allowed, and this checked income. This special session was needed  to authorize an issue of ten millions in treasury notes to tide the  Government over the crisis.    [1840]    Another influence which now worked powerfully against the Democracy was  hostility to slavery. This campaign--it was the first--saw a \"Liberty  Party\" in the field, with its own candidates, Birney and Earle. The  abolition sentiment, of which more will be said in a subsequent chapter,  was growing day by day, and little as the Whigs could be called an  antislavery party on the whole, their rank and file were very much more  of that mind than those of the opposition. Jackson had ranted wildly  against the despatch of abolition literature through the mails. The  second Seminole War, 1835-42, was waged mainly in deference to  slave-holders, to recover for them their Florida runaways, and, by  removal of the Seminoles beyond the Mississippi, to break up a popular  resort for escaped negroes.  The Indians, under Osceola, whose wife, as  daughter to a slave-mother, had been treacherously carried back into  bondage, fought like tigers. After their massacre of Major Dade and his  detachment, Generals Gaines, Jesup, Taylor, Armistead, and Worth  successively marched against them, none but the last-named successful in  subduing them. Over 500 persons had been restored to slavery, each one  costing the Government, as was estimated, at least $80,000 and the lives  of three white soldiers.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General William J. Worth.      [1839]    Van Buren was to the slavocrats even more obsequious than Jackson. His  spirit was shown, among other things, by the Amistad case, in 1839. The  schooner Amistad was sailing between Havana and Puerto Principe with a  cargo of negroes kidnapped in Africa. Under the lead of a bright negro  named Cinque the captives revolted and killed or confined all the crew  but two, whom they commanded to steer the ship for Africa. Instead,  these directed her to the United States coast, where she was seized off  Long Island by a war vessel and brought into New London. The negroes  were, even by Spanish law, not slaves but free men, as Spain had  prohibited the slave trade. Yet when their case was tried before the  district court, Mr. Van Buren spared no effort to procure their release  to the Spanish claimants. He even had a government vessel all ready to  convey the poor victims back to Cuba. The district court having decided  for the blacks, the government attorney appealed to the circuit court,  thence also to the supreme court.  Final judgment happily re-affirmed  that the men were free. The supreme court trial was the occasion of one  of John Quincy Adams's most splendid forensic victories, he being the  counsel for the negroes.    The attitude of the administration in this affair greatly injured the  party in the North, the more as it but illustrated a spirit and policy  which had grown characteristic of the party's head. In several instances  previous to this time, when ships conveying slaves from one of the  United States to another, entered the ports of the Bahama Islands  through stress of weather, England had, while freeing them, allowed some  compensation. Now, having emancipated the slaves in her own West Indian  possessions, she declined longer to continue that practice. Her first  refusal touched the slaves on the ship Enterprise, which had put in at  Port Hamilton in 1835. Jackson's administration in vain sought  indemnity, Van Buren, then Secretary of State, designating this business  as \"the most immediately pressing\" before the English embassy.
