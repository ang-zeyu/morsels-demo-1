Nobody can deny _that_ progress. Nobody could  well deny the fact that ethical progress under engineering guidance  would be equally great.    I hold a brief for engineers, of course. Engineering has been my major  work for twenty years and more. It has been my privilege to associate  intimately with two men--yea, three--possessed of great engineering  ability. The third man failed of great repute, owing chiefly to his  advanced--rather too much advanced--visionings. He wanted to talk across  the ocean by telephone at a time when the cable interests successfully  prevented him from commercializing his apparatus. And he died a  disappointed inventor. But he had the stuff in him, the thing that makes  for human greatness, just as had the other and more successful two men  with whom I as a designer was privileged to work. All were men of kindly  spirit, of broad outlook, of unselfish devotion to worldly interests.  Each was a humanitarian. Each saw things as they are, and each saw  things as they should be, and each thought much on problems of human  welfare and betterment. Of such men in civic affairs the nation, and  indeed the entire world of nations, has had but a sad too few in the  past. It is to be hoped, and it is the belief of the writer, that  engineers will become more plentiful in civic life in the future.    I have always believed that the man who reached an advanced age without  a sizable bank-account is a fact which would well serve as a definition  as to what constitutes an idealist. There are many such men--meaning, of  course, men having a level set of brains, and not mental incompetents.  Such men are inclined to things other than the accumulation of  bank-accounts. They strive toward goals which to them are more worth  while--self-improvement, for instance, spiritual growth being a better  term. Of such men were the world's acknowledged saviors. A man who can  wilfully thrust oars against the current of a stream flowing  currency-wise, in such a way as to force himself into a back eddy or  pool more or less stagnant, is a man pronouncedly great among men. The  world is loath to recognize such a man for what he is; yet such men have  lived and still live and will continue to live, always more for others  than for themselves--seeing life in the true, in other and more gracious  words.    Engineers, in the abstract, are such men. The accumulation of money is  secondary with them. Their work holds first place in importance.  Possessed of that professional pride which will not permit a man to set  aside his work and enter a more lucrative and materially satisfactory  field of endeavor--if he starve in his obstinacy--engineers are men of  the temperament, aside from the training, to minister to public needs  and desires. Self-effacement is the engineer's chief characteristic. He  views largely and without bias. He can see things from the other  fellow's angle because he is not an engineer if he has not the gift of  imagination. The successful engineer has this most precious of  endowments, and, having it, cannot but be possessed also of kindliness  and sympathy, which are imagination's own brothers. Kindliness and  sympathy are needed in the high places of our government for the people  by the people. And because men in time gravitate to their rightful  sphere of usefulness through the workings of an all-wise Providence,  engineers already have turned and are turning toward the administration  of public affairs.          IX    CODE OF ETHICS      All engineering societies have a code of ethics for the guidance of  their membership bodies. In each case it is a code based upon other and  older codes, codes long in practice among professional men, such as  lawyers and doctors. It is a code built up on Christian principles, as  it should be, and rarely is it ignored among men of the profession. To  do unto others as you would have others do unto you is the basis of its  precepts, though more concretely it aims to guide the engineer in his  business intercourse with other men in such a way as to give all an  equal chance without transgressing the law. The so-called building codes  in effect in large cities are intended to hold engineers to restrictions  for the greatest good of the greatest number, and the code of ethics in  practice among each of the engineering professions likewise was devised  toward this end. There seems to be need for it.    Perhaps by pointing out where engineers sometimes transgress, the  writer more effectively can indicate the need of a code and the  principles of which the engineering code of ethics consists. Even to-day  there are engineers digressing from the path indicated by the  professional body, though in such a way as to benefit still by the  protection of the law, and to be not openly susceptible to admonition  from the engineering societies' committees. Engineers of this stamp at  best are but tricksters. Actually, they should be debarred from  practice, just as the legal fraternity takes effective action against  members of the bar who go outside the pale, though nothing is ever done  to engineers. Engineering organizations in this regard are weak. The  man's name should at least be posted, or, better still, published in the  society's bulletin, so that the fraternity at large could know, and,  knowing, could warn men with capital to invest--the trickster's especial  prey--for its own welfare.    There was an engineer brought to the attention of the writer whose  activities were devoted to securing for his clients men of no mechanical  knowledge who yet wanted something done by machinery. A manufacturer of  paper dolls, say, having entered upon this phase of manufacturing only  because he had money to invest and not because he was interested in  mechanics, would see the need in his plant for additional mechanical  devices to cut down manufacturing costs. The engineer to whom I have  reference would find this type of manufacturer his particular \"meat,\"  because of the man's ignorance of mechanics, and, after clinching him  with a contract drawn up by the engineer's lawyer, would undertake to  devise for this manufacturer a perpetual-motion machine, if that  happened to be what the manufacturer wanted. The engineer conducted a  machine-shop in connection with his \"consulting\" office, where, at a  dollar an hour for the use of his machine-tools, he would \"develop\" his  ideas, as passed upon by the manufacturer who knew no more of  construction or the reading of mechanical drawings than he did of the  chicanery of the engineer, and in this way roll up the costs against the  unfortunate. In the end the engineer might and might not produce a  satisfactory working machine. There was nothing in the contract about  this--save only as it protected the engineer. What was indeed produced  was a list of costs for the development often of several designs of a  given idea that to say the least were heartrending.    Then there is the engineer who for a consideration will bear false  testimony against his neighbor, or his neighbor's ox. This happens most  frequently in municipal traction or lighting wars, set before tribunals  under the caption of \"The People _vs._ the S. S. Street Railway  Company,\" or in a battle of alleged infringement of patent rights. There  are engineering experts, just as there are legal experts, who deem it  within their code of ethics to address themselves and their energies  toward the refutation of such claims, however wrong or right these  claims may be. Engineering is an exact science. It is based on  principles hardly refutable. Yet there are engineers who will and can  confound these principles before a court of law in such manner as to win  for their clients a decision of non-suit where the facts point glaringly  to infringement--in the matter of mechanics--or to win for their clients  a favorable decision in the matter of costs of maintenance and operation  of a railway, in a case of this kind. As has been said, figures don't  lie, but figurers sometimes do.    Other instances of breach of engineering ethics, however otherwise  secure from the clutches of the law, occur to the writer, but the two  just cited ought to serve. At best, the topic is unpleasant and by no  means indicates the character of the profession as a whole. Where there  is one engineer who will perjure himself in the fashion as set forth  above there are many thousands of engineers who could not be bought for  this purpose at any amount of money. The profession of engineering is  notably clean; its code of ethics rigidly adhered to; the rights of  others, both in and out of the profession, regarded with something akin  to sacredness. Engineers, as a body, for instance, possess a peculiarly  rigid idea concerning themselves in relation to branches of the  profession outside their own and yet intimately close to their own.  Called in as an expert in the matter of heating and lighting a building,  say, the heating and lighting engineer will rigidly confine himself to  this phase of the engineering venture and to no other, however he may  find his work again and again overlapping the work of the structural  engineer or the industrial engineer--phases concerning which he may  possess important knowledge. He regards these things as strictly none of  his business, and in doing so conserves the esteem and friendship of his  confreres.    The code of ethics is a liberal one among the engineering groups. It has  been laid down with an eye to fairness both for the practitioner and  the client. Rigidly held to, it will admit of no engineer going far  wrong in the practice of his profession, and, broken, will not land him  in jail. It is presupposed that engineers are men of intelligence. A man  of intelligence will hold himself to the spirit of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#8)"],[1," was unquestionably important.          CHAPTER III  DIDACTIC LITERATURE--SERMONS--HISTORY      I  DIDACTIC LITERATURE    The didactic literature, moral and scientific, of the Middle Ages  is abundant, and possesses much curious interest, but it is seldom  original in substance, and seldom valuable from the point of view  of literary style. In great part it is translated or derived from  Latin sources. The writers were often clerks or laymen who had turned  from the vanities of youth--fabliau or romance--and now aimed at  edification or instruction. Science in the hands of the clergy must  needs be spiritualised and moralised; there were sermons to be found  in stones, pious allegories in beast and bird; mystic meanings in  the alphabet, in grammar, in the chase, in the tourney, in the game  of chess. Ovid and Virgil were sanctified to religious uses. The  earliest versified Bestiary, which is also a Volucrary, a Herbary,  and a Lapidary, that of Philippe de Thaon (before 1135), is versified  from the Latin _Physiologus_, itself a translation from the work of  an Alexandrian Greek of the second century. In its symbolic zoology  the lion and the pelican are emblems of Christ; the unicorn is God;  the crocodile is the devil; the stones \"turrobolen,\" which blaze when  they approach each other, are representative of man and woman. A  _Bestiaire d'Amour_ was written by Richard de Fournival, in which  the emblems serve for the interpretation of human love. A Lapidary,  with a medical--not a moral--purpose, by Marbode, Bishop of Rennes,  was translated more than once into French, and had, indeed, an  European fame.    Bestiaries and Lapidaries form parts of the vast encyclopaedias,  numerous in the thirteenth century, which were known by such names  as _Image du Monde_, _Mappe-monde_, _Miroir du Monde_. Of these  encyclopaedias, the only one which has a literary interest is the  _Tresor_ (1265), by Dante's master, Brunetto Latini, who wrote in  French in preference to his native Italian. In it science escapes  not wholly from fantasy and myth, but at least from the allegorising  spirit; his ethics and rhetoric are derived from Latin originals;  his politics are his own. The _Somme des Vices et des Vertus_, compiled  in 1279 by Friar Lorens, is a well-composed _tresor_ of religion and  morals. Part of its contents has become familiar to us through the  Canterbury discourse of Chaucer's parson. The moral experience of  a man of the world is summed up in the prose treatise on \"The Four  Ages of Man,\" by Philippe de Novare, chancellor of Cyprus. With this  edifying work may be grouped the so-called _Chastiements_, counsels  on education and conduct, designed for readers in general or for some  special class--women, children, persons of knightly or of humble  rank; studies of the virtues of chivalry, the rules of courtesy and  of manners.[1] Other writings, the _Etats du Monde_, present a view  of the various classes of society from a standpoint ethical, religious,  or satirical, with warnings and exhortations, which commonly  conclude with a vision of the last judgment and the pains of hell.  With such a scene of terror closes the interesting _Poeme Moral_ of  Etienne de Fougeres, in which the life of St. Moses, the converted  robber, serves as an example to monks, and that of the converted Thais  to ladies who are proud of their beauty. Its temper of moderation  contrasts with the bitter satire in the _Bible_ by Guiot de Provins,  and with many shorter satirical pieces directed against clerical  vices or the infirmities of woman. The _Besant de Dieu_, by Guillaume  le Clerc, a Norman poet (1227), preaches in verse, with eloquence  and imaginative power, the love of God and contempt of the world from  the texts of two Scripture parables--that of the Talents and that  of the Bridegroom; Guillaume anticipates the approaching end of the  world, foreshown by wars, pestilence, and famine, condemns in the  spirit of Christian charity the persecution of the Albigenses, and  mourns over the shame that has befallen the Holy Sepulchre.    [Footnote 1: Two works of the fourteenth century, interesting in the  history of manners and ideas, may here be mentioned--the _Livre du  Chevalier de la Tour-Landry_ (1372), composed for the instruction  of the writer's daughters, and the _Menagier de Paris_, a treatise  on domestic economy, written by a Parisian bourgeois for the use of  his young wife.]    Among the preacher poets of the thirteenth century the most  interesting personally is the minstrel RUTEBEUF, who towards the  close of his gay though ragged life turned to serious thoughts, and  expressed his penitent feelings with penetrating power. Rutebeuf,  indeed--the Villon of his age--deployed his vivid and ardent powers  in many directions, as a writer of song and satire, of allegory, of  fabliaux, of drama. On each and all he impressed his own personality;  the lyric note, imaginative fire, colour, melody, these were gifts  that compensated the poet's poverty, his conjugal miseries, his lost  eye, his faithless friends, his swarming adversaries. The  personification of vices and virtues, occasional in the _Besant_ and  other poems, becomes a system in the _Songe d'Enfer_, a pilgrim's  progress to hell, and the _Voie de Paradis_, a pilgrim's progress  to heaven, by Raoul de Houdan (after 1200). The _Pelerinage de la  Vie Humaine_--another \"way to Paradise\"; the _Pelerinage de  l'Ame_--a vision of hell, purgatory, and heaven; and the _Pelerinage  de Jesus-Christ_--a narrative of the Saviour's life, by Guillaume  de Digulleville (fourteenth century), have been imagined by some to  have been among the sources of Bunyan's allegories. Human life may  be represented in one aspect as a pilgrimage; in another it is a  knightly encounter; there is a great strife between the powers of  good and evil; in _Le Tornoiement Antecrist_, by Huon de Meri, Jesus  and the Knights of the Cross, among whom, besides St. Michael, St.  Gabriel, Confession, Chastity, and Alms, are Arthur, Launcelot, and  Gawain, contend against Antichrist and the infernal barons--Jupiter,  Neptune, Beelzebub, and a crowd of allegorical personages. But the  battles and _debats_ of a chivalric age were not only religious; there  are battles of wine and water, battles of fast and feasting, battles  of the seven arts. A disputation between the body and the soul, a  favourite subject for separate treatment by mediaeval poets, is found  also in one of the many sermons in verse; the _Debat des Trois Morts  et des Trois Vifs_ recalls the subject of the memorable painting in  the Campo Santo at Pisa.      II  SERMONS    The Latin sermons of the Middle Ages were countless; but it is not  until Gerson and the close of the fourteenth century that we find  a series of discourses by a known preacher written and pronounced  in French. It is maintained that these Latin sermons, though prepared  in the language of the Church, were delivered, when addressed to lay  audiences, in the vernacular, and that those composite sermons in  the macaronic style, that is, partly in French, partly in Latin, which  appear in the thirteenth century and are frequent in the fifteenth,  were the work of reporters or redactors among the auditory. On the  other hand, it is argued that both Latin and French sermons were  pronounced as each might seem suitable, before the laity, and that  the macaronic style was actually practised in the pulpit. Perhaps  we may accept the opinion that the short and simple homilies designed  for the people, little esteemed as compositions, were rarely thought  worthy of preservation in a Latin form; those discourses which remain  to us, if occasionally used before an unlearned audience, seem to  have been specially intended for clerkly hearers. The sermons of St.  Bernard, which have been preserved in Latin and in a French  translation of the thirteenth century, were certainly not his  eloquent popular improvisations; they are doctrinal, with crude or  curious allegorisings of Holy Scripture. Those of Maurice de Sully,  Archbishop of Paris, probably also translated from the Latin, are  simpler in manner and more practical in their teaching; but in these  characteristics they stand apart from the other sermons of the twelfth  century.    It was not until the mendicant orders, Franciscans and Dominicans,  began their labours that preaching, as preserved to us, was truly  laicised and popularised. During the thirteenth century the work of  the pulpit came to be conceived as an art which could be taught;  collections of anecdotes and illustrations--_exempla_--for the  enlivening of sermons, manuals for the use of preachers were formed;  rules and precepts were set forth; themes for popular discourse were  proposed and enlarged upon, until at length original thought and  invention ceased; the preacher's art was turned into an easy trade.  The effort to be popular often resulted in pulpit buffoonery. When  GERSON preached at court or to the people towards the close of the  fourteenth century, gravely exhorting high and low to practical  duties, with tender or passionate appeals to religious feeling, his  sermons were noble exceptions to the common practice. And the descent  from Gerson to even his more eminent successors is swift and steep.  The orators of the pulpit varied their discourse from burlesque mirth  or bitter invective to gross terrors, in which death and judgment,  Satan and hell-fire were largely displayed. The sermons of Michel  Menot and Olivier Maillard, sometimes eloquent in their censure of  sin, sometimes trivial or grotesque, sometimes pedantic in their  exhibition of learning, have at least an historical value in  presenting an image of social life in the fifteenth century.    A word must be said of the humanism which preceded the Renaissance.  Scholars and students there were in France two hundred years before  the days of Erasmus and of Bude; but they were not"]]]
