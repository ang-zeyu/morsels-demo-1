You with  a beggarly ten thousand, and I with twenty.  But what is, or will be, the  effect of those secret trusts?\"    \"Oh, that,\" I said, \"will, I dare say, be all right.  Uncle Roger  evidently did not intend the older generation to benefit too much by his  death.  But he only gave Rupert St. Leger one thousand pounds, whilst he  gave me ten.  That looks as if he had more regard for the direct line.  Of course--\"  Father interrupted me:    \"But what was the meaning of a further sum?\"    \"I don't know, father.  There was evidently some condition which he was  to fulfil; but he evidently didn't expect that he would.  Why, otherwise,  did he leave a second trust to Mr. Trent?\"    \"True!\" said father.  Then he went on: \"I wonder why he left those  enormous sums to Trent and old MacKelpie.  They seem out of all  proportion as executors' fees, unless--\"    \"Unless what, father?\"    \"Unless the fortune he has left is an enormous one.  That is why I  asked.\"    \"And that,\" I laughed, \"is why he refused to answer.\"    \"Why, Ernest, it must run into big figures.\"    \"Right-ho, father.  The death-duties will be annoying.  What a beastly  swindle the death-duties are!  Why, I shall suffer even on your own  little estate . . . \"    \"That will do!\" he said curtly.  Father is so ridiculously touchy.  One  would think he expects to live for ever.  Presently he spoke again:    \"I wonder what are the conditions of that trust.  They are as  important--almost--as the amount of the bequest--whatever it is.  By the  way, there seems to be no mention in the will of a residuary legatee.  Ernest, my boy, we may have to fight over that.\"    \"How do you make that out, father?\" I asked.  He had been very rude over  the matter of the death-duties of his own estate, though it is entailed  and I _must_ inherit.  So I determined to let him see that I know a good  deal more than he does--of law, at any rate.  \"I fear that when we come  to look into it closely that dog won't fight.  In the first place, that  may be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which is a part of the  Will.  And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the  conditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins  to work.  What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked  at it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation.  But  even if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the  corpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn  pleases.  He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one  can say a word.  In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal.\"    \"H'm!\" said father to himself.  \"It is a queer kind of will, I take it,  that can override the Court of Chancery.  We shall perhaps have to try it  before we are done with this!\"  With that he rose, and we walked home  together--without saying another word.    My mother was very inquisitive about the whole thing--women always are.  Father and I between us told her all it was necessary for her to know.  I  think we were both afraid that, woman-like, she would make trouble for us  by saying or doing something injudicious.  Indeed, she manifested such  hostility towards Rupert St. Leger that it is quite on the cards that she  may try to injure him in some way.  So when father said that he would  have to go out shortly again, as he wished to consult his solicitor, I  jumped up and said I would go with him, as I, too, should take advice as  to how I stood in the matter.    _The Contents of Letter marked_ \"_B_\" _attached as an Integral Part to  the Last Will of Roger Melton_.                                                              _June_ 11, 1907.        \"This letter an integral part of my Last Will regards the entire      residue of my estate beyond the specific bequests made in the body of      my Will.  It is to appoint as Residuary Legatee of such Will--in case      he may accept in due form the Conditions herein laid down--my dear      Nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my sister Patience Melton now      deceased by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger also now      deceased.  On his acceptance of the Conditions and the fulfilment of      the first of them the Entire residue of my estate after payments of      all specific Legacies and of all my debts and other obligations is to      become his absolute property to be dealt with or disposed of as he      may desire.  The following are the conditions.        \"1.  He is to accept provisionally by letter addressed to my      Executors a sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand pounds      sterling free of all Duties Taxes or other imposts.  This he will      hold for a period of six months from the date of the Reading of my      Last Will and have user of the accruements thereto calculated at the      rate of ten per centum per annum which amount he shall under no      circumstances be required to replace.  At the end of said six months      he must express in writing directed to the Executors of my Will his      acceptance or refusal of the other conditions herein to follow.  But      if he may so choose he shall be free to declare in writing to the      Executors within one week from the time of the Reading of the Will      his wish to accept or to withdraw altogether from the responsibility      of this Trust.  In case of withdrawal he is to retain absolutely and      for his own use the above-mentioned sum of nine hundred and      ninety-nine thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties Taxes and      imposts whatsoever making with the specific bequest of one thousand      pounds a clear sum of one million pounds sterling free of all      imposts.  And he will from the moment of the delivery of such written      withdrawal cease to have any right or interest whatsoever in the      further disposition of my estate under this instrument.  Should such      written withdrawal be received by my Executors they shall have      possession of such residue of my estate as shall remain after the      payment of the above sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand      pounds sterling and the payment of all Duties Taxes assessments or      Imposts as may be entailed by law by its conveyance to the said      Rupert Sent Leger and these my Executors shall hold the same for the      further disposal of it according to the instructions given in the      letter marked C and which is also an integral part of my Last Will      and Testament.        \"2.  If at or before the expiration of the six months above-mentioned      the said Rupert Sent Leger shall have accepted the further conditions      herein stated, he is to have user of the entire income produced by      such residue of my estate the said income being paid to him Quarterly      on the usual Quarter Days by the aforesaid Executors to wit Major      General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie Bart. and Edward Bingham Trent      to be used by him in accordance with the terms and conditions      hereinafter mentioned.        \"3.  The said Rupert Sent Leger is to reside for a period of at least      six months to begin not later than three months from the reading of      my Will in the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains.      And if he fulfil the Conditions imposed on him and shall thereby      become possessed of the residue of my estate he is to continue to      reside there in part for a period of one year.  He is not to change      his British Nationality except by a formal consent of the Privy      Council of Great Britain.        \"At the end of a year and a half from the Reading of my Will he is to      report in person to my Executors of the expenditure of amounts paid      or due by him in the carrying out of the Trust and if they are      satisfied that same are in general accord with the conditions named      in above-mentioned letter marked C and which is an integral part of      my Will they are to record their approval on such Will which can then      go for final Probate and Taxation.

(_Personal and Confidential_.)        MEMORANDA MADE BY EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE WILL OF      ROGER MELTON.                                                            _January_ 3, 1907.        The interests and issues of all concerned in the Will and estate of      the late Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange are so vast that in case any      litigation should take place regarding the same, I, as the solicitor,      having the carriage of the testator's wishes, think it well to make      certain memoranda of events, conversations, etc., not covered by      documentary evidence.  I make the first memorandum immediately after      the event, whilst every detail of act and conversation is still fresh      in my mind.  I shall also try to make such comments thereon as may      serve to refresh my memory hereafter, and which in case of my death      may perhaps afford as opinions contemporaneously recorded some      guiding light to other or others who may later on have to continue      and complete the tasks entrusted to me.        I.        CONCERNING THE READING OF THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON.        When, beginning at 11 o'clock a.m. on this the forenoon of Thursday,      the 3rd day of January, 1907, I opened the Will and read it in full,      except the clauses contained in the letters marked \"B\" and \"C\"; there      were present in addition to myself, the following:        1.

CREON  This had I done already, but I deemed  It first behooved me to consult the god.    OEDIPUS  His will was set forth fully--to destroy  The parricide, the scoundrel;  and I am he.    CREON  Yea, so he spake, but in our present plight  'Twere better to consult the god anew.    OEDIPUS  Dare ye inquire concerning such a wretch?    CREON  Yea, for thyself wouldst credit now his word.    OEDIPUS  Aye, and on thee in all humility  I lay this charge:  let her who lies within  Receive such burial as thou shalt ordain;  Such rites 'tis thine, as brother, to perform.  But for myself, O never let my Thebes,  The city of my sires, be doomed to bear  The burden of my presence while I live.  No, let me be a dweller on the hills,  On yonder mount Cithaeron, famed as mine,  My tomb predestined for me by my sire  And mother, while they lived, that I may die  Slain as they sought to slay me, when alive.  This much I know full surely, nor disease  Shall end my days, nor any common chance;  For I had ne'er been snatched from death, unless  I was predestined to some awful doom.       So be it.  I reck not how Fate deals with me  But my unhappy children--for my sons  Be not concerned, O Creon, they are men,  And for themselves, where'er they be, can fend.  But for my daughters twain, poor innocent maids,  Who ever sat beside me at the board  Sharing my viands, drinking of my cup,  For them, I pray thee, care, and, if thou willst,  O might I feel their touch and make my moan.  Hear me, O prince, my noble-hearted prince!  Could I but blindly touch them with my hands  I'd think they still were mine, as when I saw.  [ANTIGONE and ISMENE are led in.]  What say I? can it be my pretty ones  Whose sobs I hear?  Has Creon pitied me  And sent me my two darlings?  Can this be?    CREON  'Tis true; 'twas I procured thee this delight,  Knowing the joy they were to thee of old.    OEDIPUS  God speed thee! and as meed for bringing them  May Providence deal with thee kindlier  Than it has dealt with me!  O children mine,  Where are ye?  Let me clasp you with these hands,  A brother's hands, a father's; hands that made  Lack-luster sockets of his once bright eyes;  Hands of a man who blindly, recklessly,  Became your sire by her from whom he sprang.  Though I cannot behold you, I must weep  In thinking of the evil days to come,  The slights and wrongs that men will put upon you.  Where'er ye go to feast or festival,  No merrymaking will it prove for you,  But oft abashed in tears ye will return.  And when ye come to marriageable years,  Where's the bold wooers who will jeopardize  To take unto himself such disrepute  As to my children's children still must cling,  For what of infamy is lacking here?  \"Their father slew his father, sowed the seed  Where he himself was gendered, and begat  These maidens at the source wherefrom he sprang.\"  Such are the gibes that men will cast at you.  Who then will wed you?  None, I ween, but ye  Must pine, poor maids, in single barrenness.  O Prince, Menoeceus' son, to thee, I turn,  With the it rests to father them, for we  Their natural parents, both of us, are lost.  O leave them not to wander poor, unwed,  Thy kin, nor let them share my low estate.  O pity them so young, and but for thee  All destitute.  Thy hand upon it, Prince.  To you, my children I had much to say,  Were ye but ripe to hear.  Let this suffice:  Pray ye may find some home and live content,  And may your lot prove happier than your sire's.    CREON  Thou hast had enough of weeping; pass within.    OEDIPUS                                               I must obey,  Though 'tis grievous.    CREON                           Weep not, everything must have its day.    OEDIPUS  Well I go, but on conditions.    CREON                                What thy terms for going, say.    OEDIPUS  Send me from the land an exile.    CREON                                Ask this of the gods, not me.    OEDIPUS  But I am the gods' abhorrence.    CREON                                Then they soon will grant thy plea.    OEDIPUS  Lead me hence, then, I am willing.    CREON                                     Come, but let thy children go.    OEDIPUS  Rob me not of these my children!    CREON                                     Crave not mastery in all,  For the mastery that raised thee was thy bane and wrought thy fall.    CHORUS  Look ye, countrymen and Thebans, this is Oedipus the great,  He who knew the Sphinx's riddle and was mightiest in our state.  Who of all our townsmen gazed not on his fame with envious eyes?  Now, in what a sea of troubles sunk and overwhelmed he lies!  Therefore wait to see life's ending ere thou count one mortal blest;  Wait till free from pain and sorrow he has gained his final rest.

He sits to rest on a rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and  is bidden depart by a passing native. But Oedipus, instructed by an  oracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and  the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the  Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind  beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-  striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed  hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will  confer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus.  From Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil;  the benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs  having promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than  Creon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off  (Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about  to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries  up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him  till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next  scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs  Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon  wishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father's  forgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to  the side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and  invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of  thunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his  hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the  way to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and  his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed  none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the  gods took him.                                  *****                              DRAMATIS PERSONAE    OEDIPUS, banished King of Thebes.  ANTIGONE, his daughter.  ISMENE, his daughter.  THESEUS, King of Athens.  CREON, brother of Jocasta, now reigning at Thebes.  POLYNEICES, elder son of Oedipus.  STRANGER, a native of Colonus.

OEDIPUS  Child of an old blind sire, Antigone,  What region, say, whose city have we reached?  Who will provide today with scanted dole  This wanderer?  'Tis little that he craves,  And less obtains--that less enough for me;  For I am taught by suffering to endure,  And the long years that have grown old with me,  And last not least, by true nobility.  My daughter, if thou seest a resting place  On common ground or by some sacred grove,  Stay me and set me down.  Let us discover  Where we have come, for strangers must inquire  Of denizens, and do as they are bid.    ANTIGONE  Long-suffering father, Oedipus, the towers  That fence the city still are faint and far;  But where we stand is surely holy ground;  A wilderness of laurel, olive, vine;  Within a choir or songster nightingales  Are warbling.  On this native seat of rock  Rest; for an old man thou hast traveled far.    OEDIPUS  Guide these dark steps and seat me there secure.    ANTIGONE  If time can teach, I need not to be told.    OEDIPUS  Say, prithee, if thou knowest, where we are.    ANTIGONE  Athens I recognize, but not the spot.    OEDIPUS  That much we heard from every wayfarer.    ANTIGONE  Shall I go on and ask about the place?    OEDIPUS  Yes, daughter, if it be inhabited.    ANTIGONE  Sure there are habitations; but no need  To leave thee; yonder is a man hard by.    OEDIPUS  What, moving hitherward and on his way?    ANTIGONE  Say rather, here already.  Ask him straight  The needful questions, for the man is here.  [Enter STRANGER]"]]]
