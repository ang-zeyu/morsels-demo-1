The best time for this sport is from ten to  eleven in the forenoon, from two to three in the afternoon, and about  an hour before sunset, when the birds come to the watering places in  flocks before they retire to roost.    The application of bird-lime is of ancient origin, and is practised in  many countries. Pennant gives an account of how to take Small birds by  liming twigs around a stuffed or tethered live owl. I have heard of  this plan being adopted, but have not tried it myself. From the  curious manner in which small birds usually mob an owl, I should fancy  it would succeed.    According to Folkard's \"Wildfowler:\"      \"There was also a method much in vogue previously to the invention and  discovery of decoys, of taking wild fowl with lime strings made of  packthread or string, knotted in various ways and besmeared with  birdlime; these were set in rows about fens, moors, and other feeding  haunts of the birds, an hour or two before morning or evening  twilight. This plan was to procure a number of small stakes, about 2  ft. in length, sharpened to a point at the nether end, and forked at  the upper. These were pricked out in rows about a yard or two apart,  some being placed in a slanting direction, and each stake siding one  with another, within convenient distances of 4 yds. or 5 yds, so as to  bear up the strings, which were laid upon the crutches, and placed  loosely about 18 in. above the ground. The lime strings were thus  drawn from stake to stake in various directions, and lightly placed  between the forks at the top of the stakes, some rows being higher  than others; and in this manner the whole space occupied by the stakes  was covered with lime strings, as if carefully laid in wave-like  coils, or placed in different directions, the ends being secured to  the stakes with slip-knots, so that upon a light strain the whole of  any string which might be touched by the bird became instantly loose,  and, sticking to the feathers, the more it struggled to free itself,  so much the more the string twisted about it, and thus the bird was  quickly entangled, and became an easy prey. In this manner numbers of  wild fowl of the largest species were taken at night at the moment of  sweeping over the ground at very slow flight, just before alighting;  and it would appear that this method of fowling was particularly  successful in taking plovers, which generally alight on the ground  thickly congregated together.    A similar method was employed for taking wild fowl with lime strings  placed over the surface of rivers and ponds frequented by those birds,  and apparently with remarkable success. For this purpose it was  necessary to procure a waterproof bird-lime wherewith to dress the  strings, which were knotted in a similar manner to those employed for  taking birds on land. The strings so prepared were in serpentine coils  from stake to stake, the stakes being forked at the top, and of  similar form to those last described, but of sufficient length to  reach the bottom of the water and obtain a firm fixing in the mud.  Some of the stakes were placed on the banks of the water or in any  manner so that the lime strings could be drawn across and about the  surface in different directions, resting here and there on some or  other of the stakes or any boughs or overhanging trees, in such a way  that the birds, when in the act of alighting on the water at night,  might strike against the lime strings and become therein entangled.    The principal secret of success in this and the preceding device was  that of placing the lime strings in shaded places over the most  assured haunts of the birds; and it was only obtainable on dark  nights, or in good shade, for whenever there was sufficient light for  the birds to see the least sign of the snare spread for them the  fowler had no chance of making any captives. (And be sure to take this  caution not to use these strings in moonshine nights, for the shadow  of the line will create a jealousy in the fowl, and so frustrate your  sport.) And as wildfowl in their descent, just before alighting on the  water, diverge from their accustomed angular figure, and spread  themselves more in a broad front line, a whole flight sometimes comes  swooping into the fowler's snare all at once.\"      A method of trapping, with the assistance of bird-lime, might, I  think, be tried with some chance of success. It is to insert a piece  of fish in a cone of paper well smeared with bird-lime, and to throw  down a few of these prepared cones in places accessible to gulls,  herons, and such birds, who, in attempting to seize the fish, would be  effectually hoodwinked, and thus easily secured.    Hawking, by which birds are captured by trained falcons, is of the  highest antiquity. Pennant mentions that the Saxon King Ethelbert (who  died in 760) sent to Germany for a cast of falcons to fly at cranes  (herons?). As this sport has now fallen into disuse, I must refer my  readers for particulars to Blaine, Daniel, Freeman, Harting, Captain  Dugmore, and to occasional articles by one or two modern falconers in  the columns of the Field.    The infinite variety of nets used in the capture of various birds  requires almost a chapter by itself; but it will suffice for the  present one if we mention those most generally used, or the most  striking varieties. First, then, comes the ordinary \"clap-net\" of the  London and provincial bird-catchers. The \"Edinburgh Encyclopaedia\"  says, with regard to clap-nets:    \"Birds are also taken with nets during the day, and especially in  those seasons of the year when they change their situation; in the  month of October, for instance, when the wild birds begin to fly, and  in March, when the smaller kinds assemble for pairing. They are  chiefly on the wing from daybreak to noon, and always fly against the  wind. The birdcatchers, therefore, lay their nets towards that point  to which the wind blows. The nets employed in this way are generally  12.5 yds. long and 2.5 yds. wide, and are spread on the ground  parallel to each other, in such a manner as to meet when turned over.  They are provided with lines, fastened in such a way that, by a sudden  pull, the birdcatcher is able to draw them over the birds that may  have alighted in the space between those parallel sides. In order to  entice the wild birds to alight amongst the nets, call birds are  employed, of which there must be one or two of each of the different  kinds which are expected to be caught, such as linnets, goldfinches,  greenfinches, etc. Besides the call birds there are others denominated  flur birds, which are placed upon a moveable perch within the net,  called a flur, and which can be raised or depressed at pleasure, and  these are secured to the flur by means of a brace or bandage of  slender silk strongly fastened round the body of the bird. The call  birds are deposited in cages at a little distance from the nets, and  as soon as they see or hear the approach of the wild birds, which they  perceive long before it can be observed by the birdcatcher, they  announce the intelligence from cage to cage with the greatest  appearance of joy, and they proceed to invite them to alight by a  succession of notes or short jerks, as they are termed by the  birdcatcher, which may often be heard at a considerable distance. The  moment that the call is heard by the wild birds they stop their flight  and descend towards the net, and so great is the ascendancy and  fascination of the call birds that they can induce the others to  return repeatedly to the nets till every bird in the flock be caught.\"    Being somewhat afraid that this description would not meet all the  practical requirements of the case, and knowing myself but little or  nothing of this mode of birdcatching, I thought it advisable to  interview a practical man. Having at last succeeded in capturing a  specimen of the genus homo, species birdcatcher, I prevailed upon him  (through the medium of a tip) to impart his stock of birdcatching  lore, and to cut me patterns of play-sticks and pegs, and also to  correct my rough sketches when necessary.    The sum and substance of my interview is as follows: The nets, which  are of two pieces, are each about twelve yards long by two-and-a-half  yards wide, and are made with a three-quarter mesh of what is  technically called two-thread. The staves at each end, to which the  nets are permanently attached, are made of red deal, ferruled and  jointed at the middle, in the manner of a fishing rod, for the  convenience of carriage. The length of each when put together is about  five feet six inches, being thus shorter than the width of the net.  This, it will be readily observed, allows for the bagging of the  net--an important particular, as, if the nets were strained tight with  no allowance made for bagging, the birds would flutter along the  ground until they got out at one end or the other. As it is, they roll  themselves up in the meshes, and effectually entangle themselves while  attempting to escape.    A strong line, called the top line, made of clock line, passes the  whole length of each net, and is protracted some feet past the staves  at either end. A similar line runs along the bottom made of  three-thread or whip thread. This is called the bottom line. There are  then two unattached cords of some strength, called "]]]
