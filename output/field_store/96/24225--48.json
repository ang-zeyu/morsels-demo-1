And what do you think it was but a big umbrella  with a white handle? Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away  from him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it. I  felt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella  open when it wasent raining. But the Cowans do such queer things. You  remember the time Jerry Cowan sold us God's picture. Amos took me right  home and I was thankful for I don't know what would have become of me  if he hadn't come along. I couldn't sleep all night and I never want to  have any more adventures like that one.                                          CECILY KING.      PERSONALS    Mr. Dan King felt somewhat indisposed the day after Christmas--probably  as the result of too much mince pie. (DAN, INDIGNANTLY:--\"I wasn't. I  only et one piece!\")    Mr. Peter Craig thinks he saw the Family Ghost on Christmas Eve. But  the rest of us think all he saw was the white calf with the red tail.  (PETER, MUTTERING SULKILY:--\"It's a queer calf that would walk up on end  and wring its hands.\")    Miss Cecily King spent the night of Dec. 20th with Miss Kitty Marr. They  talked most of the night about new knitted lace patterns and their beaus  and were very sleepy in school next day. (CECILY, SHARPLY:--\"We never  mentioned such things!\")    Patrick Grayfur, Esq., was indisposed yesterday, but seems to be  enjoying his usual health to-day.    The King family expect their Aunt Eliza to visit them in January. She  is really our great-aunt. We have never seen her but we are told she is  very deaf and does not like children. So Aunt Janet says we must make  ourselves scarece when she comes.    Miss Cecily King has undertaken to fill with names a square of the  missionary quilt which the Mission Band is making. You pay five cents  to have your name embroidered in a corner, ten cents to have it in  the centre, and a quarter if you want it left off altogether.

He'd  better stick to his own department.\")      HOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT    Mrs. Alexander King killed all her geese the twentieth of December. We  all helped pick them. We had one Christmas Day and will have one every  fortnight the rest of the winter.    The bread was sour last week because mother wouldn't take my advice. I  told her it was too warm for it in the corner behind the stove.    Miss Felicity King invented a new recete for date cookies recently,  which everybody said were excelent. I am not going to publish it though,  because I don't want other people to find it out.    ANXIOUS INQUIRER:--If you want to remove inkstains place the stain  over steam and apply salt and lemon juice. If it was Dan who sent this  question in I'd advise him to stop wiping his pen on his shirt sleeves  and then he wouldn't have so many stains.

(FELIX, ENRAGED:--\"I never asked such a question.\")    C-c-l-y:--No, it is not polite to use \"Holy Moses\" or \"dodgasted\" in  ordinary conversation.    (Cecily had gone down cellar to replenish the apple plate, so this  passed without protest.)    S-r-a:--No, it isn't polite to cry all the time. As to whether you  should ask a young man in, it all depends on whether he went home with  you of his own accord or was sent by some elderly relative.    F-l-t-y:--It does not break any rule of etiquette if you keep a button  off your best young man's coat for a keepsake. But don't take more than  one or his mother might miss them.                                              DAN KING.      FASHION NOTES    Knitted mufflers are much more stylish than crocheted ones this winter.  It is nice to have one the same colour as your cap.    Red mittens with a black diamond pattern on the back are much run after.  Em Frewen's grandma knits hers for her. She can knit the double diamond  pattern and Em puts on such airs about it, but I think the single  diamond is in better taste.    The new winter hats at Markdale are very pretty. It is so exciting to  pick a hat. Boys can't have that fun. Their hats are so much alike.                                           CECILY KING.      FUNNY PARAGRAPHS    This is a true joke and really happened.    There was an old local preacher in New Brunswick one time whose name was  Samuel Clask. He used to preach and pray and visit the sick just like a  regular minister. One day he was visiting a neighbour who was dying and  he prayed the Lord to have mercy on him because he was very poor and  had worked so hard all his life that he hadn't much time to attend to  religion.    \"And if you don't believe me, O Lord,\" Mr. Clask finished up with, \"just  take a look at his hands.\"                                            FELIX KING.

(DAN, AGGRIEVED:--\"Well, I'd never heard of porpoises and it sounded  like something that grew. But you needn't have gone and put it in the  paper.\"    FELIX:--\"It isn't any worse than the things you put in about me that I  never asked at all.\"    CECILY, SOOTHINGLY:--\"Oh, well, boys, it's all in fun, and I think Our  Magazine is perfectly elegant.\"    FELICITY, FAILING TO SEE THE STORY GIRL AND BEVERLEY EXCHANGING WINKS  BEHIND HER BACK:--\"It certainly is, though SOME PEOPLE were so opposed  to starting it.\")      What harmless, happy fooling it all was! How we laughed as we read and  listened and devoured apples! Blow high, blow low, no wind can ever  quench the ruddy glow of that faraway winter night in our memories. And  though Our Magazine never made much of a stir in the world, or was the  means of hatching any genius, it continued to be capital fun for us  throughout the year.          CHAPTER VI. GREAT-AUNT ELIZA'S VISIT      It was a diamond winter day in February--clear, cold, hard, brilliant.  The sharp blue sky shone, the white fields and hills glittered, the  fringe of icicles around the eaves of Uncle Alec's house sparkled. Keen  was the frost and crisp the snow over our world; and we young fry of the  King households were all agog to enjoy life--for was it not Saturday,  and were we not left all alone to keep house?    Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia had had their last big \"kill\" of market  poultry the day before; and early in the morning all our grown-ups set  forth to Charlottetown, to be gone the whole day. They left us many  charges as usual, some of which we remembered and some of which we  forgot; but with Felicity in command none of us dared stray far out of  line. The Story Girl and Peter came over, of course, and we all agreed  that we would haste and get the work done in the forenoon, that we might  have an afternoon of uninterrupted enjoyment. A taffy-pull after dinner  and then a jolly hour of coasting on the hill field before supper were  on our programme. But disappointment was our portion. We did manage to  get the taffy made but before we could sample the result satisfactorily,  and just as the girls were finishing with the washing of the dishes,  Felicity glanced out of the window and exclaimed in tones of dismay,    \"Oh, dear me, here's Great-aunt Eliza coming up the lane! Now, isn't  that too mean?\"    We all looked out to see a tall, gray-haired lady approaching the house,  looking about her with the slightly puzzled air of a stranger. We had  been expecting Great-aunt Eliza's advent for some weeks, for she was  visiting relatives in Markdale. We knew she was liable to pounce down on  us any time, being one of those delightful folk who like to \"surprise\"  people, but we had never thought of her coming that particular day. It  must be confessed that we did not look forward to her visit with any  pleasure. None of us had ever seen her, but we knew she was very deaf,  and had very decided opinions as to the way in which children should  behave.    \"Whew!\" whistled Dan. \"We're in for a jolly afternoon. She's deaf as a  post and we'll have to split our throats to make her hear at all. I've a  notion to skin out.\"    \"Oh, don't talk like that, Dan,\" said Cecily reproachfully. \"She's old  and lonely and has had a great deal of trouble. She has buried three  husbands. We must be kind to her and do the best we can to make her  visit pleasant.\"    \"She's coming to the back door,\" said Felicity, with an agitated glance  around the kitchen. \"I told you, Dan, that you should have shovelled the  snow away from the front door this morning. Cecily, set those pots  in the pantry quick--hide those boots, Felix--shut the cupboard door,  Peter--Sara, straighten up the lounge. She's awfully particular and ma  says her house is always as neat as wax.\"    To do Felicity justice, while she issued orders to the rest of us,  she was flying busily about herself, and it was amazing how much was  accomplished in the way of putting the kitchen in perfect order during  the two minutes in which Great-aunt Eliza was crossing the yard.    \"Fortunately the sitting-room is tidy and there's plenty in the pantry,\"  said Felicity, who could face anything undauntedly with a well-stocked  larder behind her.    Further conversation was cut short by a decided rap at the door.  Felicity opened it.    \"Why, how do you do, Aunt Eliza?\" she said loudly.    A slightly bewildered look appeared on Aunt Eliza's face. Felicity  perceived she had not spoken loudly enough.    \"How do you do, Aunt Eliza,\" she repeated at the top of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#8)"],[1," Rafe scrambled gingerly over the gullied lip of the channel it had cut,  and bent carefully to scoop up water in his palm and drink. \"Phew, it's  colder than Zandru's ninth hell. Must come straight down from a  glacier!\"    It did. I remembered the trail and remembered the spot. Kendricks joined  me at the water's edge, and asked, \"How do we get across?\"    \"I'm not sure,\" I said, studying the racing white torrent. Overhead,  about twenty feet from where we clustered on the slope, the thick  branches of enormous trees overhung the rapids, their long roots  partially bared, gnarled and twisted by recurrent floods; and between  these trees swayed one of the queer swing-bridges of the trailmen,  hanging only about ten feet above the water.    Even I had never learned to navigate one of these swing-bridges without  assistance; human arms are no longer suited to brachiation. I might have  managed it once; but at present, except as a desperate final expedient,  it was out of the question. Rafe or Lerrys, who were lightly built and  acrobatic, could probably do it as a simple stunt on the level, in a  field; on a steep and rocky mountainside, where a fall might mean being  dashed a thousand feet down the torrent, I doubted it. The trailmen's  bridge was out ... but what other choice was there?    I beckoned to Kendricks, he being the man I was the most inclined to  trust with my life at the moment, and said, \"It looks uncrossable, but I  think two men could get across, if they were steady on their feet. The  others can hold us on ropes, in case we do get knocked down. If we can  get to the opposite bank, we can stretch a fixed rope from that snub of  rock--\" I pointed, \"and the others can cross with that. The first men  over will be the only ones to run any risk. Want to try?\"    I liked it better that he didn't answer right away, but went to the edge  of the gully and peered down the rocky chasm. Doubtless, if we were  knocked down, all seven of the others could haul us up again; but not  before we'd been badly smashed on the rocks. And once again I caught  that elusive shadow of movement in the brushwood; if the trailmen chose  a moment when we were half-in, half-out of the rapids, we'd be  ridiculously vulnerable to attack.    \"We ought to be able to get a fixed rope easier than that,\" Hjalmar  said, and took one of the spares from his rucksack. He coiled it, making  a running loop on one end, and standing precariously on the lip of the  rapids, sent it spinning toward the outcrop of rock we had chosen as a  fixed point. \"If I can get it over....\"    The rope fell short, and Hjalmar reeled it in and cast the loop again.  He made three more unsuccessful tries before finally, with held breath,  we watched the noose settle over the rocky snub. Gently, pulling the  line taut, we watched it stretch above the rapids. The knot tightened,  fastened. Hjalmar grinned and let out his breath.    \"There,\" he said, and jerked hard on the rope, testing it with a long  hard pull. The rocky outcrop broke, with a sharp crack, split, and  toppled entirely into the rapids, the sudden jerk almost pulling Hjalmar  off his feet. The boulder rolled, with a great bouncing splash, faster  and faster down the mountain, taking the rope with it.    We just stood and stared for a minute. Hjalmar swore horribly, in the  unprintable filth of the mountain tongue, and his brothers joined in.  \"How the devil was I to know the _rock_ would split off?\"    \"Better for it to split now than when we were depending on it,\" Kyla  said stolidly. \"I have a better idea.\" She was untying herself from the  rope as she spoke, and knotting one of the spares through her belt. She  handed the other end of the rope to Lerrys. \"Hold on to this,\" she said,  and slipped out of her blankety windbreak, standing shivering in a thin  sweater. She unstrapped her boots and tossed them to me. \"Now boost me  on your shoulders, Hjalmar.\"    Too late, I guessed her intention and shouted, \"No, don't try--!\" But  she had already clambered to an unsteady perch on the big Darkovan's  shoulders and made a flying grab for the lowest loop of the trailmen's  bridge. She hung there, swaying slightly and sickeningly, as the loose  lianas gave to her weight.    \"Hjalmar--Lerrys--haul her down!\"    \"I'm lighter than any of you,\" Kyla called shrilly, \"and not hefty  enough to be any use on the ropes!\" Her voice quavered somewhat as she  added, \"--and hang on to that rope, Lerrys! If you lose it, I'll have  done this for nothing!\"    She gripped the loop of vine and reached, with her free hand, for the  next loop. Now she was swinging out over the edge of the boiling rapids.  Tight-mouthed, I gestured to the others to spread out slightly  below--not that anything would help her if she fell.    Hjalmar, watching as the woman gained the third loop--which joggled  horribly to her slight weight--shouted suddenly, \"Kyla, quick! The loop  _beyond_--don't touch the next one! It's frayed--rotted through!\"    Kyla brought her left hand up to her right on the third loop. She made a  long reach, missed her grab, swung again, and clung, breathing hard, to  the safe fifth loop. I watched, sick with dread. The damned girl should  have told me what she intended.    Kyla glanced down and we got a glimpse of her face, glistening with the  mixture of sunburn cream and sweat, drawn with effort. Her tiny swaying  figure hung twelve feet above the white tumbling water, and if she lost  her grip, only a miracle could bring her out alive. She hung there for a  minute, jiggling slightly, then started a long back-and-forward swing.  On the third forward swing she made a long leap and grabbed at the final  loop.    It slipped through her fingers; she made a wild grab with the other  hand, and the liana dipped sharply under her weight, raced through her  fingers, and with a sharp snap, broke in two. She gave a wild shriek as  it parted, and twisted her body frantically in mid-air, landing asprawl  half-in, half-out of the rapids, but on the further bank. She hauled her  legs up on dry land and crouched there, drenched to the waist but safe.    [Illustration: The rope swung perilously, threatening to dash her on the  rocks.]           *       *       *       *       *    The Darkovans were yelling in delight. I motioned to Lerrys to make his  end of the rope fast around a hefty tree-root, and shouted, \"Are you  hurt?\" She indicated in pantomime that the thundering of the water  drowned words, and bent to belay her end of the rope. In sign-language I  gestured to her to make very sure of the knots; if anyone slipped, she  hadn't the weight to hold us.    I hauled on the rope myself to test it, and it held fast. I slung her  boots around my neck by their cords, then, gripping the fixed rope,  Kendricks and I stepped into the water.    It was even icier than I expected, and my first step was nearly the  last; the rush of the white water knocked me to my knees, and I  floundered and would have measured my length except for my hands on the  fixed rope. Buck Kendricks grabbed at me, letting go the rope to do it,  and I swore at him, raging, while we got on our feet again and braced  ourselves against the onrushing current. While we struggled in the  pounding waters, I admitted to myself; we could never have crossed  without the rope Kyla had risked her life to fix.    Shivering, we got across and hauled ourselves out. I signalled to the  others to cross two at a time, and Kyla seized my elbow. \"Jason--\"    \"Later, dammit!\" I had to shout to make myself heard over the roaring  water, as I held out a hand to help Rafe get his footing on the ledge.    \"This--can't--wait,\" she yelled, cupping her hands and shouting into my  ear. I turned on her. \"_What!_\"    \"There are--_trailmen_--on the top level--of that bridge! I saw them!  They cut the loop!\"    Regis and Hjalmar came struggling across last; Regis, lightly-built, was  swept off his feet and Hjalmar turned to grab him, but I shouted to him  to keep clear--they were still roped together and if the ropes fouled we  might drown someone. Lerrys and I leaped down and hauled Regis clear; he  coughed, spitting icy water, drenched to the skin.    I motioned to Lerrys to leave the fixed rope, though I had little hope  that it would be there when we returned, and looked quickly around,  debating what to do. Regis and Rafe and I were wet clear through; the  others to well above the knee. At this altitude, this was dangerous,  although we were not yet high enough to worry about frostbite. Trailmen  or no trailmen, we must run the lesser risk of finding a place where we  could kindle a fire and dry out.    \"Up there--there's a clearing,\" I said briefly, and hurried them along.           *       *       *       *       *    It was hard climbing now, on rock, and there were places where we had to  scrabble for handholds, and flatten ourselves out against an almost  sheer wall. The keen wind rose as we climbed higher, whining through the  thick forest, soughing in the rocky outcrops, and biting through our  soaked clothing with icy teeth. Kendricks was having hard going now, and  I helped him as much as I could, but I was aching with cold. We gained  the clearing, a small bare spot on a lesser peak, and I directed the two  Darkovan brothers who were the driest to gather dry brushwood and get a  fire going. It was hardly near enough sunset to camp; but by the time we  were dry enough to go on safely, it would be, so I gave orders to get  the tent up, then rounded angrily on Kyla.    \"See here, another time don't try any dangerous tricks unless you're  ordered to!\"    \"Go easy on her,\" Regis Hastur interceded, \"we'd never have crossed  without the fixed rope. Good work, girl.\"    \"You keep out of this!\" I snapped. It was true, yet resentment boiled in  me as Kyla's plain sullen face glowed under the praise from the Hastur.    The fact was--I admitted it grudgingly--a lightweight like Kyla"]]]
