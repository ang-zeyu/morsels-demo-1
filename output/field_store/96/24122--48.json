[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271"],[0,"Black Beauty (#8)"],[1," was in a  moment at my head.    \"That was a very near touch,\" said my master. \"What's to be done now?\"    \"Well, sir, we can't drive over that tree, nor yet get round it; there  will be nothing for it, but to go back to the four crossways, and that  will be a good six miles before we get round to the wooden bridge again;  it will make us late, but the horse is fresh.\"    So back we went and round by the crossroads, but by the time we got to  the bridge it was very nearly dark; we could just see that the water was  over the middle of it; but as that happened sometimes when the floods  were out, master did not stop. We were going along at a good pace, but  the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge I felt sure  there was something wrong. I dare not go forward, and I made a dead  stop. \"Go on, Beauty,\" said my master, and he gave me a touch with the  whip, but I dare not stir; he gave me a sharp cut; I jumped, but I dare  not go forward.    \"There's something wrong, sir,\" said John, and he sprang out of the  dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me  forward. \"Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?\" Of course I could not  tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe.    Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the  house, tossing a torch about like one mad.    \"Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!\" he cried.    \"What's the matter?\" shouted my master.    \"The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if  you come on you'll be into the river.\"    \"Thank God!\" said my master. \"You Beauty!\" said John, and took the  bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river  side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off  after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and  darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly  making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor  John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not  understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had  gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given  way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into  the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was  no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have  been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could  find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which  did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in  its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men. John had  many stories to tell of dogs and horses, and the wonderful things they  had done; he thought people did not value their animals half enough nor  make friends of them as they ought to do. I am sure he makes friends of  them if ever a man did.    At last we came to the park gates and found the gardener looking out for  us. He said that mistress had been in a dreadful way ever since dark,  fearing some accident had happened, and that she had sent James off on  Justice, the roan cob, toward the wooden bridge to make inquiry after  us.    We saw a light at the hall-door and at the upper windows, and as we came  up mistress ran out, saying, \"Are you really safe, my dear? Oh! I  have been so anxious, fancying all sorts of things. Have you had no  accident?\"    \"No, my dear; but if your Black Beauty had not been wiser than we were  we should all have been carried down the river at the wooden bridge.\"  I heard no more, as they went into the house, and John took me to the  stable. Oh, what a good supper he gave me that night, a good bran mash  and some crushed beans with my oats, and such a thick bed of straw! and  I was glad of it, for I was tired.          13 The Devil's Trade Mark      One day when John and I had been out on some business of our master's,  and were returning gently on a long, straight road, at some distance we  saw a boy trying to leap a pony over a gate; the pony would not take the  leap, and the boy cut him with the whip, but he only turned off on one  side. He whipped him again, but the pony turned off on the other side.  Then the boy got off and gave him a hard thrashing, and knocked him  about the head; then he got up again and tried to make him leap the  gate, kicking him all the time shamefully, but still the pony refused.  When we were nearly at the spot the pony put down his head and threw up  his heels, and sent the boy neatly over into a broad quickset hedge, and  with the rein dangling from his head he set off home at a full gallop.  John laughed out quite loud. \"Served him right,\" he said.    \"Oh, oh, oh!\" cried the boy as he struggled about among the thorns; \"I  say, come and help me out.\"    \"Thank ye,\" said John, \"I think you are quite in the right place, and  maybe a little scratching will teach you not to leap a pony over a gate  that is too high for him,\" and so with that John rode off. \"It may be,\"  said he to himself, \"that young fellow is a liar as well as a cruel one;  we'll just go home by Farmer Bushby's, Beauty, and then if anybody wants  to know you and I can tell 'em, ye see.\" So we turned off to the right,  and soon came up to the stack-yard, and within sight of the house. The  farmer was hurrying out into the road, and his wife was standing at the  gate, looking very frightened.    \"Have you seen my boy?\" said Mr. Bushby as we came up; \"he went out an  hour ago on my black pony, and the creature is just come back without a  rider.\"    \"I should think, sir,\" said John, \"he had better be without a rider,  unless he can be ridden properly.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said the farmer.    \"Well, sir, I saw your son whipping, and kicking, and knocking that good  little pony about shamefully because he would not leap a gate that was  too high for him. The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at  last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the  thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse  me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so. There's no bones broken, sir;  he'll only get a few scratches. I love horses, and it riles me to see  them badly used; it is a bad plan to aggravate an animal till he uses  his heels; the first time is not always the last.\"    During this time the mother began to cry, \"Oh, my poor Bill, I must go  and meet him; he must be hurt.\"    \"You had better go into the house, wife,\" said the farmer; \"Bill wants a  lesson about this, and I must see that he gets it; this is not the first  time, nor the second, that he has ill-used that pony, and I shall stop  it. I am much obliged to you, Manly. Good-evening.\"    So we went on, John chuckling all the way home; then he told James about  it, who laughed and said, \"Serve him right. I knew that boy at school;  he took great airs on himself because he was a farmer's son; he used to  swagger about and bully the little boys. Of course, we elder ones would  not have any of that nonsense, and let him know that in the school and  the playground farmers' sons and laborers' sons were all alike. I well  remember one day, just before afternoon school, I found him at the large  window catching flies and pulling off their wings. He did not see me and  I gave him a box on the ears that laid him sprawling on the floor. Well,  angry as I was, I was almost frightened, he roared and bellowed in such  a style. The boys rushed in from the playground, and the master ran in  from the road to see who was being murdered. Of course I said fair and  square at once what I had done, and why; then I showed the master the  flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him  the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as  Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did  not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool  for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to  play for that week. Then he talked to all the boys very seriously about  cruelty, and said how hard-hearted and cowardly it was to hurt the  weak and the helpless; but what stuck in my mind was this, he said that  cruelty was the devil's own trade-mark, and if we saw any one who took  pleasure in cruelty we might know who he belonged to, for the devil was  a murderer from the beginning, and a tormentor to the end. On the other  hand, where we saw people who loved their neighbors, and were kind to  man and beast, we might know that was God's mark.\"    \"Your master never taught you a truer thing,\" said John; \"there is no  religion without love, and people may talk as much as they like about  their religion, but if it does not teach them to be good and kind to man  and beast it is all a sham--all a sham, James, and it won't stand when  things come to be turned inside out.\"          14 James Howard      Early one morning in December John had just led me into my box after my  daily exercise, and was strapping my cloth on and James was coming in  from the corn chamber with some oats, when the master came into the  stable. He looked rather serious, and held an open letter in his hand.  John fastened the door of my box, touched his cap, and waited for  orders.    \"Good-morning, John,\" said the master. \"I want to know if you have any  complaint to make of James.\"    \"Complaint, sir? No, sir.\"    \"Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?\"    \"Yes, sir, always.\"    \"You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?\"    \"Never, sir.\"    \"That's well; but I must put another question. Have you no reason to  suspect, when he goes out with the horses to exercise them or to take a  message, that he stops about talking to his acquaintances, or goes into  houses where he has no business, leaving the horses outside?\"    \"No, sir, certainly not; and if anybody has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#8)"],[1,"seen.\"    \"Say rather, as I did see. Well, that is precisely the state of the  case, my dear Porthos. Aramis, who only drew the plans, wishes to pass  himself off as the engineer, whilst you, who, stone by stone, built the  wall, the citadel, and the bastions, he wishes to reduce to the rank of  a mere builder.\"    \"By builder, you mean mason, perhaps?\"    \"Mason; the very word.\"    \"Plasterer, in fact?\"    \"Hodman?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Oh, oh! my dear Aramis, you seem to think you are only five and twenty  years of age still.\"    \"Yes, and that is not all, for he believes you are fifty.\"    \"I should have amazingly liked to have seen him at work.\"    \"Yes, indeed.\"    \"A fellow who has got the gout?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who has lost three of his teeth?\"    \"Four.\"    \"While I, look at mine.\" And Porthos, opening his large mouth very wide,  displayed two rows of teeth not quite as white as snow, but even, hard,  and sound as ivory.    \"You can hardly believe, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"what a fancy the  king has for good teeth. Yours decide me; I will present you to the king  myself.\"    \"You?\"    \"Why not? Do you think I have less credit at court than Aramis?\"    \"Oh, no!\"    \"Do you think I have the slightest pretensions upon the fortifications  at Belle-Isle?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"It is your own interest alone which would induce me to do it.\"    \"I don't doubt it in the least.\"    \"Well, I am the intimate friend of the king; and a proof of that is,  that whenever there is anything disagreeable to tell him, it is I who  have to do it.\"    \"But, dear D'Artagnan, if you present me--\"    \"Well!\"    \"Aramis will be angry.\"    \"With me?\"    \"No, with _me_.\"    \"Bah! whether he or I present you, since you are to be presented, what  does it matter?\"    \"They were going to get me some clothes made.\"    \"Your own are splendid.\"    \"Oh! those I had ordered were far more beautiful.\"    \"Take care: the king likes simplicity.\"    \"In that case, I will be simple. But what will M. Fouquet say, when he  learns that I have left?\"    \"Are you a prisoner, then, on parole?\"    \"No, not quite that. But I promised him I would not leave without  letting him know.\"    \"Wait a minute, we shall return to that presently. Have you anything to  do here?\"    \"I, nothing: nothing of any importance, at least.\"    \"Unless, indeed, you are Aramis's representative for something of  importance.\"    \"By no means.\"    \"What I tell you--pray, understand that--is out of interest for you. I  suppose, for instance, that you are commissioned to send messages and  letters to him?\"    \"Ah! letters--yes. I send certain letters to him.\"    \"Where?\"    \"To Fontainebleau.\"    \"Have you any letters, then?\"    \"But--\"    \"Nay, let me speak. Have you any letters, I say?\"    \"I have just received one for him.\"    \"Interesting?\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"You do not read them, then?\"    \"I am not at all curious,\" said Porthos, as he drew out of his pocket  the soldier's letter which Porthos had not read, but D'Artagnan had.    \"Do you know what to do with it?\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Of course; do as I always do, send it to him.\"    \"Not so.\"    \"Why not? Keep it, then?\"    \"Did they not tell you that this letter was important?\"    \"Very important.\"    \"Well, you must take it yourself to Fontainebleau.\"    \"To Aramis?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Very good.\"    \"And since the king is there--\"    \"You will profit by that.\"    \"I shall profit by the opportunity to present you to the king.\"    \"Ah! D'Artagnan, there is no one like you for expedients.\"    \"Therefore, instead of forwarding to our friend any messages, which may  or may not be faithfully delivered, we will ourselves be the bearers of  the letter.\"    \"I had never even thought of that, and yet it is simple enough.\"    \"And therefore, because it is urgent, Porthos, we ought to set off at  once.\"    \"In fact,\" said Porthos, \"the sooner we set off the less chance there is  of Aramis's letter being delayed.\"    \"Porthos, your reasoning is always accurate, and, in your case, logic  seems to serve as an auxiliary to the imagination.\"    \"Do you think so?\" said Porthos.    \"It is the result of your hard reading,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"So come  along, let us be off.\"    \"But,\" said Porthos, \"my promise to M. Fouquet?\"    \"Which?\"    \"Not to leave Saint-Mande without telling him of it.\"    \"Ah! Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"how very young you still are.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"You are going to Fontainebleau, are you not, where you will find M.  Fouquet?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Probably in the king's palace?\"    \"Yes,\" repeated Porthos, with an air full of majesty.    \"Well, you will accost him with these words: 'M. Fouquet, I have the  honor to inform you that I have just left Saint-Mande.'\"    \"And,\" said Porthos, with the same majestic mien, \"seeing me at  Fontainebleau at the king's, M. Fouquet will not be able to tell me I am  not speaking the truth.\"    \"My dear Porthos, I was just on the point of opening my lips to make  the same remark, but you anticipate me in everything. Oh! Porthos, how  fortunately you are gifted! Years have made not the slightest impression  on you.\"    \"Not over-much, certainly.\"    \"Then there is nothing more to say?\"    \"I think not.\"    \"All your scruples are removed?\"    \"Quite so.\"    \"In that case I shall carry you off with me.\"    \"Exactly; and I will go and get my horse saddled.\"    \"You have horses here, then?\"    \"I have five.\"    \"You had them sent from Pierrefonds, I suppose?\"    \"No, M. Fouquet gave them to me.\"    \"My dear Porthos, we shall not want five horses for two persons;  besides, I have already three in Paris, which would make eight, and that  will be too many.\"    \"It would not be too many if I had some of my servants here; but, alas!  I have not got them.\"    \"Do you regret them, then?\"    \"I regret Mousqueton; I miss Mousqueton.\"    \"What a good-hearted fellow you are, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but  the best thing you can do is to leave your horses here, as you have left  Mousqueton out yonder.\"    \"Why so?\"    \"Because, by and by, it might turn out a very good thing if M. Fouquet  had never given you anything at all.\"    \"I don't understand you,\" said Porthos.    \"It is not necessary you should understand.\"    \"But yet--\"    \"I will explain to you later, Porthos.\"    \"I'll wager it is some piece of policy or other.\"    \"And of the most subtle character,\" returned D'Artagnan.    Porthos nodded his head at this word policy; then, after a moment's  reflection, he added, \"I confess, D'Artagnan, that I am no politician.\"    \"I know that well.\"    \"Oh! no one knows what you told me yourself, you, the bravest of the  brave.\"    \"What did I tell you, Porthos?\"    \"That every man has his day. You told me so, and I have experienced it  myself. There are certain days when one feels less pleasure than others  in exposing one's self to a bullet or a sword-thrust.\"    \"Exactly my own idea.\"    \"And mine, too, although I can hardly believe in blows or thrusts that  kill outright.\"    \"The deuce! and yet you have killed a few in your time.\"    \"Yes; but I have never been killed.\"    \"Your reason is a very good one.\"    \"Therefore, I do not believe I shall ever die from a thrust of a sword  or a gun-shot.\"    \"In that case, then, you are afraid of nothing. Ah! water, perhaps?\"    \"Oh! I swim like an otter.\"    \"Of a quartan fever, then?\"    \"I have never had one yet, and I don't believe I ever shall; but there  is one thing I will admit,\" and Porthos dropped his voice.    \"What is that?\" asked D'Artagnan, adopting the same tone of voice as  Porthos.    \"I must confess,\" repeated Porthos, \"that I am horribly afraid of  politics.\"    \"Ah, bah!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.    \"Upon my word, it's true,\" said Porthos, in a stentorian voice. \"I have  seen his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Richelieu, and his eminence  Monsieur le Cardinal de Mazarin; the one was a red politician, the other  a black politician; I never felt very much more satisfied with the one  than with the other; the first struck off the heads of M. de Marillac,  M. de Thou, M. de Cinq-Mars, M. Chalais, M. de Bouteville, and M. de  Montmorency; the second got a whole crowd of Frondeurs cut in pieces,  and we belonged to them.\"    \"On the contrary, we did not belong to them,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Oh! indeed, yes; for if I unsheathed my sword for the cardinal, I  struck it for the king.\"    \"My good Porthos!\"    \"Well, I have done. My dread of politics is such, that if there is any  question of politics in the matter, I should greatly prefer to return to  Pierrefonds.\"    \"You would be quite right, if that were the case. But with me, my dear  Porthos, no politics at all, that is quite clear. You have labored hard  in fortifying Belle-Isle; the king wished to know the name of the clever  engineer under whose directions the works were carried out; you are  modest, as all men of true genius are; perhaps Aramis wishes to put you  under a bushel. But I happen to seize hold of you; I make it known  who you are; I produce you; the king rewards you; and that is the only  policy I have to do with.\"    \"And the only one I will have to do with either,\" said Porthos, holding  out his hand to D'Artagnan.    But D'Artagnan knew Porthos's grasp; he knew that, once imprisoned  within the baron's five fingers, no hand ever left it without being  half-crushed. He therefore held out, not his hand, but his fist, and  Porthos did not even perceive the difference. The servants talked a  little with each other in an undertone, and whispered a few words,  which D'Artagnan understood, but which he took very good care not to let  Porthos understand. \"Our friend,\" he said to himself, \"was really and  truly Aramis's prisoner. Let us now see what the result will be of the  liberation of the captive.\"        Chapter IV. The Rat and the Cheese.    D'Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot, as D'Artagnan had set out.  When D'Artagnan, as he entered the shop of the Pilon d'Or,"]]]
