But Sir WILLIAM WATSON went with him, and it was      arranged so that they set out with the diligence at night, and by      that means his absence did not last above three or four days, when      my brother returned alone, Sir WILLIAM remaining with his father.        \"Now a very busy winter was commencing; for my brother had engaged      himself to conduct the oratorios conjointly with RONZINI, and had      made himself answerable for the payment of the engaged performers,      for his credit ever stood high in the opinion of every one he had to      deal with. (He lost considerably by this arrangement.) But, though      at times much harassed with business, the mirror for the thirty-foot      reflector was never out of his mind, and if a minute could but be      spared in going from one scholar to another, or giving one the slip,      he called at home to see how the men went on with the furnace, which      was built in a room below, even with the garden.        \"The mirror was to be cast in a mould of loam, of which an immense      quantity was to be pounded in a mortar and sifted through a fine      sieve. It was an endless piece of work, and served me for many an      hour's exercise; and ALEX. frequently took his turn at it, for we      were all eager to do something towards the great undertaking. Even      Sir WILLIAM WATSON would sometimes take the pestle from me when he      found me in the work-room, where he expected to find his friend, in      whose concerns he took so much interest that he felt much      disappointed at not being allowed to pay for the metal. But I do not      think my brother ever accepted pecuniary assistance from any one of      his friends, and on this occasion he declined the offer by saying it      was paid for already.        \"Among the Bath visitors were many philosophical gentlemen who used      to frequent the levees at St. James's, when in town. Colonel WALSH,      in particular, informed my brother that from a conversation he had      had with His Majesty, it appeared that in the spring he was to come      with his seven-foot telescope to the king. Similar reports he      received from many others, but they made no great impression nor      caused any interruption in his occupation or study, and as soon as      the season for the concerts was over, and the mould, etc., in      readiness, a day was set apart for casting, and the metal was in the      furnace. Unfortunately it began to leak at the moment when ready for      pouring, and both my brothers and the caster, with his men, were      obliged to run out at opposite doors, for the stone flooring (which      ought to have been taken up) flew about in all directions as high as      the ceiling. Before the second casting was attempted, everything      which could insure success had been attended to, and a very perfect      metal was found in the mould.        \"But a total stop and derangement now took place, and nearly six or      seven months elapsed before my brother could return to the      undisturbed enjoyment of his instruments and observations. For one      morning in Passion Week, as Sir WILLIAM WATSON was with my brother,      talking about the pending journey to town, my eldest nephew arrived      to pay us a visit, and brought the confirmation that his uncle was      expected with his instrument in town. . . . We had not one night in      the week, except Friday, but what was set apart for an oratorio either      at Bath or Bristol. Soon after Easter, a new organ being erected in      St. James's Church, it was opened with two performances of the      'Messiah;' this again took up some of my brother's time.\". . .    In May of 1782 HERSCHEL went to London.        \"But when almost double the time had elapsed which my brother could      safely be absent from his scholars, ALEX., as well as myself, were      much at a loss how to answer their inquiries, for, from the letters      we received, we could learn nothing but that he had been introduced      to the king and queen, and had permission to come to the concerts at      Buckingham House, where the king conversed with him about      astronomy.\"    It was during his absence at this time that the three following letters  were written and received:        \"DEAR LINA:--        \"I have had an audience of His Majesty this morning, and met with a      very gracious reception. I presented him with the drawing of the      solar system, and had the honor of explaining it to him and the      queen. My telescope is in three weeks' time to go to Richmond, and      meanwhile to be put up at Greenwich, where I shall accordingly carry      it to-day. So you see, LINA, that you must not think of seeing me in      less than a month. I shall write to Miss LEE myself; and other      scholars who inquire for me, you may tell that I cannot wait on them      till His Majesty shall be pleased to give me leave to return, or      rather to dismiss me, for till then I must attend. I will also write      to Mr. PALMER to acquaint him with it.        \"I am in a great hurry, therefore can write no more at present.      Tell ALEXANDER that everything looks very likely as if I were to stay      here. The king inquired after him, and after my great speculum. He      also gave me leave to come to hear the GRIESBACHS play at the      private concert which he has every evening. My having seen the king      need not be kept a secret, but about my staying here it will be best      not to say anything, but only that I must remain here till His      Majesty has observed the planets with my telescope.        \"Yesterday I dined with Colonel WALSH, who inquired after you. There      were Mr. AUBERT and Dr. MASKELYNE. Dr. MASKELYNE in public declared      his obligations to me for having introduced to them the high powers,      for Mr. AUBERT has so much succeeded with them that he says he looks      down upon 200, 300, or 400 with contempt, and immediately begins      with 800. He has used 2,500 very completely, and seen my fine double      stars with them. All my papers are printing, with the postscript and      all, and are allowed to be very valuable. You see, LINA, I tell you      all these things. You know vanity is not my foible, therefore I need      not fear your censure. Farewell.                       \"I am, your affectionate brother,                                               \"WM.

Company is not always      pleasing, and I would much rather be polishing a speculum. Last      Friday I was at the king's concert to hear GEORGE play. The king      spoke to me as soon as he saw me, and kept me in conversation for      half an hour. He asked GEORGE to play a solo-concerto on purpose      that I might hear him; and GEORGE plays extremely well, is very much      improved, and the king likes him very much. These two last nights I      have been star-gazing at Greenwich with Dr. MASKELYNE and Mr.      AUBERT. We have compared our telescopes together, and mine was found      very superior to any of the Royal Observatory. Double stars which      they could not see with their instruments I had the pleasure to show      them very plainly, and my mechanism is so much approved of that      Dr. MASKELYNE has already ordered a model to be taken from mine,      and a stand to be made by it to his reflector. He is, however, now      so much out of love with his instrument that he begins to doubt      whether it _deserves_ a new stand.        \"I am introduced to the best company. To-morrow I dine at Lord      PALMERSTON'S, next day with Sir JOSEPH BANKS, etc., etc. Among      opticians and astronomers nothing now is talked of but _what they      call_ my great discoveries. Alas! this shows how far they are      behind, when such trifles as I have seen and done are called      _great_. Let me but get at it again! I will make such telescopes,      and see such things--that is, I will endeavor to do so.\"                               TO MISS HERSCHEL.                                                         \"_July 3, 1782._\"        \"DEAR CAROLINA:--        \"I have been so much employed that you will not wonder at my not      writing sooner. The letter you sent me last Monday came very safe to      me. As Dr. WATSON has been so good as to acquaint you and ALEXANDER      with my situation, I was still more easy in my silence to you. Last      night the King, the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal,      Princess SOPHIA, Princess AUGUSTA, etc., Duke of MONTAGUE, Dr.      HEBERDEN, M. DE LUC, etc., etc., saw my telescope, and it was a very      fine evening. My instrument gave general satisfaction. The king has      very good eyes, and enjoys observations with telescopes exceedingly.        \"This evening, as the king and queen are gone to Kew, the princesses      were desirous of seeing my telescope, but wanted to know if it was      possible to see without going out on the grass, and were much      pleased when they heard that my telescope could be carried into any      place they liked best to have it. About eight o'clock it was moved      into the queen's apartments, and we waited some time in hopes of      seeing _Jupiter_ or _Saturn_. Meanwhile I showed the princesses, and      several other ladies who were present, the speculum, the      micrometers, the movements of the telescopes, and other things that      seemed to excite their curiosity. When the evening appeared to be      totally unpromising, I proposed an artificial _Saturn_ as an object,      since we could not have the real"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29056"],[0,"Almost A Man (#8)"],[1,"and metaphor  with the skill that would be expected from her by those acquainted with  her literary powers.    The book will be found equally valuable as a text-book, a supplementary  reader or a reference book in schools, or as a book of pleasant home  instruction. Teachers in Normal Schools will find it a most suggestive  aid in teaching physiology. As it contains the most reliable scientific  facts in regard to alcohol, tobacco, and other narcotics, it fills the  demand created by the school laws compelling the teaching of the action  of narcotics on the human body.

It has  been to me intensely interesting, and I hope sincerely that the world at  large will appreciate it.--_J. M. W. Kitchen, M. D._    It gives me pleasure to note that the book, both by its subject-matter  and its pleasing form of presentation, is well adapted to the use for  which it is intended.--_B. A. Hinsdale, Professor of the Science and Art  of Teaching, University of Michigan._    I find here, wrought out in attractive form, some of the most important  knowledge that our young people ought to know. It is suitable for a  supplementary reader in the upper grammar grades of the public schools.  Part Second particularly is of the highest value to the boys and girls  in our grammar and high schools.--_W. S. Perry, Principal of High  School, Ann Arbor, Mich._    This excellent work ought to be, not only read, but studied by every one  in and out of our schools who is interested in preserving the integrity  of our bodily and mental functions. The author's method would make  knowledge invigorate and mature the judgment and not burden the memory,  and this is the germinal idea in all sound education.--_Geo. E.
