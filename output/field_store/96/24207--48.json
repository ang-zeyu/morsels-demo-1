[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3043"],[0,"The Quaker Colonies: A Chronicle of the Proprietors of the Delaware (#8)"],[1,"    Pennsylvania deserves the credit of turning these early scientific  pursuits to popular uses. The first American professorship of botany  and natural history was established in Philadelphia College, now the  University of Pennsylvania. The first American book on a medical subject  was written in Philadelphia by Thomas Cadwalader in 1740; the first  American hospital was established there in 1751; and the first  systematic instruction in medicine. Since then Philadelphia has  produced a long line of physicians and surgeons of national and European  reputation. For half a century after the Revolution the city was the  center of medical education for the country and it still retains a large  part of that preeminence. The Academy of Natural Sciences founded in  Philadelphia in 1812 by two inconspicuous young men, an apothecary and  a dentist, soon became by the spontaneous support of the community a  distinguished institution. It sent out two Arctic expeditions, that  of Kane and that of Hayes, and has included among its members the most  prominent men of science in America. It is now the oldest as well as  the most complete institution of its kind in the country. The Franklin  Institute, founded in Philadelphia in 1824, was the result of a similar  scientific interest. It was the first institution of applied science  and the mechanic arts in America. Descriptions of the first 2900 patents  issued by the United States Government are to be found only on the pages  of its Journal, which is still an authoritative annual record.    Apart from their scientific attainments, one of the most interesting  facts about the Quakers is the large proportion of them who have  reached eminence, often in occupations which are supposed to be somewhat  inconsistent with Quaker doctrine. General Greene, the most capable  American officer of the Revolution, after Washington, was a Rhode Island  Quaker. General Mifflin of the Revolution was a Pennsylvania Quaker.  General Jacob Brown, a Bucks County Pennsylvania Quaker, reorganized the  army in the War of 1819. and restored it to its former efficiency.  In the long list of Quakers eminent in all walks of life, not only in  Pennsylvania but elsewhere, are to be found John Bright, a lover of  peace and human liberty through a long and eminent career in British  politics; John Dickinson of Philadelphia, who wrote the famous Farmer's  Letters so signally useful in the American Revolution; Whittier, the  American poet, a Quaker born in Massachusetts of a family converted from  Puritanism when the Quakers invaded Boston in the seventeenth century;  and Benjamin West, a Pennsylvania Quaker of colonial times, an artist of  permanent eminence, one of the founders of the Royal Academy in England  and its president in succession to Sir Joshua Reynolds.    Wherever Quakers are found they are the useful and steady citizens.  Their eminence seems out of all proportion to their comparatively small  numbers. It has often been asked why this height of attainment should  occur among a people of such narrow religious discipline. But were  the Quakers really narrow, or were they any more narrow than other  rigorously self-disciplined people: Spartans, Puritans, soldiers whose  discipline enables them to achieve great results? All discipline is  in one sense narrow. Quaker quietude and retirement probably conserved  mental energy instead of dissipating it. In an age of superstition and  irrational religion, their minds were free and unhampered, and it was  the dominant rational tone of their thought that enabled science to  flourish in Pennsylvania.        Chapter V. The Troubles Of Penn And His Sons    The material prosperity of Penn's Holy Experiment kept on proving itself  over and over again every month of the year. But meantime great events  were taking place in England. The period of fifteen years from Penn's  return to England in 1684, until his return to Pennsylvania at the close  of the year of 1699, was an eventful time in English history. It was  long for a proprietor to be away from his province, and Penn would have  left a better reputation if he had passed those fifteen years in his  colony, for in England during that period he took what most Americans  believe to have been the wrong side in the Revolution of 1688.    Penn was closely tied by both interest and friendship to Charles II and  the Stuart family. When Charles II died in 1685 and his brother, the  Duke of York, ascended the throne as James II, Penn was equally bound  to him, because among other things the Duke of York had obtained Penn's  release in 1669 from imprisonment for his religious opinions. He became  still more bound when one of the first acts of the new King's reign  was the release of a great number of people who had been imprisoned  for their religion, among them thirteen hundred Quakers. In addition to  preaching to the Quakers and protecting them, Penn used his influence  with James to secure the return of several political offenders from  exile. His friendship with James raised him, indeed, to a position of no  little importance at Court. He was constantly consulted by the King, in  whose political policy he gradually became more and more involved.    James was a Roman Catholic and soon perfected his plans for making both  Church and State a papal appendage and securing for the Crown the right  to suspend acts of Parliament. Penn at first protested, but finally  supported the King in the belief that he would in the end establish  liberty. In his earlier years, however, Penn had written pamphlets  arguing strenuously against the same sort of despotic schemes that  James was now undertaking; and this contradiction of his former position  seriously injured his reputation even among his own people.    Part of the policy of James was to grant many favors to the Quakers and  to all other dissenting bodies in England, to release them from prison,  to give them perfect freedom of worship, and to remove the test laws  which prevented them from holding office. He thus hoped to unite them  with the Roman Catholics in extirpating the Church of England  and establishing the Papacy in its place. But the dissenters and  nonconformists, though promised relief from sufferings severer than  it is possible perhaps now to appreciate, refused almost to a man this  tempting bait. Even the Quakers, who had suffered probably more than  the others, rejected the offer with indignation and mourned the  fatal mistake of their leader Penn. All Protestant England united in  condemning him, accused him of being a secret Papist and a Jesuit in  disguise, and believed him guilty of acts and intentions of which he  was probably entirely innocent. This extreme feeling against Penn is  reflected in Macaulay's \"History of England,\" which strongly espouses  the Whig side; and in those vivid pages Penn is represented, and very  unfairly, as nothing less than a scoundrel.    In spite of the attempts which James made to secure his position, the  dissenters, the Church of England, and Penn's own Quakers all joined  heart and soul in the Revolution of 1688, which quickly dethroned the  King, drove him from England, and placed the Prince of Orange on  the throne as William III. Penn was now for many years in a very  unfortunate, if not dangerous, position, and was continually suspected  of plotting to restore James. For three years he was in hiding to escape  arrest or worse, and he largely lost the good will and affection of the  Quakers.    Meantime, since his departure from Pennsylvania in the summer of  1684, that province went on increasing in population and in pioneer  prosperity. But Penn's quitrents and money from sales of land were far  in arrears, and he had been and still was at great expense in starting  the colony and in keeping up the plantation and country seat he had  established on the Delaware River above Philadelphia. Troublesome  political disputes also arose. The Council of eighteen members which he  had authorized to act as governor in his absence neglected to send the  new laws to him, slighted his letters, and published laws in their own  name without mentioning him or the King. These irregularities were much  exaggerated by enemies of the Quakers in England. The Council was not a  popular body and was frequently at odds with the Assembly.    Penn thought he could improve the government by appointing five  commissioners to act as governor instead of the whole Council. Thomas  Lloyd, an excellent Quaker who had been President of the Council and who  had done much to allay hard feeling, was fortunately the president of  these commissioners. Penn instructed them to act as if he himself were  present, and at the next meeting of the Assembly to annul all the laws  and reenact only such as seemed proper. This course reminds us of the  absolutism of his friend, King James, and, indeed, the date of these  instructions (1686) is that when his intimacy with that bigoted monarch  reached its highest point. Penn's theory of his power was that the frame  or constitution of government he had given the province was a contract;  that, the Council and Assembly having violated some of its provisions,  it was annulled and he was free, at least for a time, to govern as he  pleased. Fortunately his commissioners never attempted to carry out  these instructions. There would have been a rebellion and some very  unpleasant history if they had undertaken to enforce such oriental  despotism in Pennsylvania. The five commissioners with Thomas Lloyd at  their head seem to have governed without seriously troublesome incidents  for the short term of two years during which they were in power. But  in 1687 Thomas Lloyd, becoming weary of directing them, asked to be  relieved and is supposed to have advised Penn to appoint a single  executive instead of commissioners. Penn accordingly appointed Captain  John Blackwell, formerly an officer in Cromwell's army."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#8)"],[1," mean and tawdry.    Fifty yards farther on, around a turn in the trail, behind a rock, a boy  was lying with a bullet wound between his eyes.  His chest was heaving  with short, hoarse noises which I guessed were due to some muscular  action entirely, and that he was virtually dead.  I lifted him and gave  him some water, but it would not pass through his fixed teeth.  In the  pocket of his blouse was a New Testament with the name Fielder Dawson,  Mo., scribbled in it in pencil.  While I was writing it down for  identification, a boy as young as himself came from behind me down the  trail.    \"It is no use,\" he said; \"the surgeon has seen him; he says he is just  the same as dead.  He is my bunkie; we only met two weeks ago at San  Antonio; but he and me had got to be such good friends--But there's  nothing I can do now.\"  He threw himself down on the rock beside his  bunkie, who was still breathing with that hoarse inhuman rattle, and I  left them, the one who had been spared looking down helplessly with the  tears creeping across his cheeks.    The firing was quite close now, and the trail was no longer filled with  blanket rolls and haversacks, nor did pitiful, prostrate figures lie in  wait behind each rock.  I guessed this must mean that I now was well in  advance of the farthest point to which Capron's troop had moved, and I  was running forward feeling confident that I must be close on our men,  when I saw the body of a sergeant blocking the trail and stretched at  full length across it.  Its position was a hundred yards in advance of  that of any of the others--it was apparently the body of the first man  killed.  After death the bodies of some men seem to shrink almost  instantly within themselves; they become limp and shapeless, and their  uniforms hang upon them strangely.  But this man, who was a giant in  life, remained a giant in death--his very attitude was one of attack; his  fists were clinched, his jaw set, and his eyes, which were still human,  seemed fixed with resolve.  He was dead, but he was not defeated.  And so  Hamilton Fish died as he had lived--defiantly, running into the very face  of the enemy, standing squarely upright on his legs instead of crouching,  as the others called to him to do, until he fell like a column across the  trail.  \"God gives,\" was the motto on the watch I took from his blouse,  and God could not have given him a nobler end; to die, in the fore-front  of the first fight of the war, quickly, painlessly, with a bullet through  the heart, with his regiment behind him, and facing the enemies of his  country.    The line at this time was divided by the trail into two wings.  The right  wing, composed of K and A Troops, was advancing through the valley,  returning the fire from the ridge as it did so, and the left wing, which  was much the longer of the two, was swinging around on the enemy's right  flank, with its own right resting on the barbed-wire fence.  I borrowed a  carbine from a wounded man, and joined the remnant of L Troop which was  close to the trail.    This troop was then commanded by Second Lieutenant Day, who on account of  his conduct that morning and at the battle of San Juan later, when he was  shot through the arm, was promoted to be captain of L Troop, or, as it  was later officially designated, Capron's troop.  He was walking up and  down the line as unconcernedly as though we were at target practice, and  an Irish sergeant, Byrne, was assisting him by keeping up a continuous  flow of comments and criticisms that showed the keenest enjoyment of the  situation.  Byrne was the only man I noticed who seemed to regard the  fight as in any way humorous.  For at Guasimas, no one had time to be  flippant, or to exhibit any signs of braggadocio.  It was for all of  them, from the moment it started, through the hot, exhausting hour and a  half that it lasted, a most serious proposition.  The conditions were  exceptional.  The men had made a night march the evening before, had been  given but three hours' troubled sleep on the wet sand, and had then been  marched in full equipment uphill and under a cruelly hot sun, directly  into action.  And eighty per cent. of them had never before been under  fire.  Nor had one man in the regiment ever fired a Krag-Jorgensen  carbine until he fired it at a Spaniard, for their arms had been issued  to them so soon before sailing that they had only drilled with them  without using cartridges.  To this handicap was also added the nature of  the ground and the fact that our men could not see their opponents.  Their own men fell or rolled over on every side, shot down by an  invisible enemy, with no one upon whom they could retaliate, with no sign  that the attack might not go on indefinitely.  Yet they never once took a  step backward, but advanced grimly, cleaning a bush or thicket of its  occupants before charging it, and securing its cover for themselves, and  answering each volley with one that sounded like an echo of the first.  The men were panting for breath; the sweat ran so readily into their eyes  that they could not see the sights of their guns; their limbs unused to  such exertion after seven days of cramped idleness on the troop-ship,  trembled with weakness and the sun blinded and dazzled them; but time  after time they rose and staggered forward through the high grass, or  beat their way with their carbines against the tangle of vines and  creepers.  A mile and a half of territory was gained foot by foot in this  fashion, the three Spanish positions carried in that distance being  marked by the thousands of Mauser cartridges that lay shining and  glittering in the grass and behind the barricades of bushes.  But this  distance had not been gained without many losses, for every one in the  regiment was engaged.  Even those who, on account of the heat, had  dropped out along the trail, as soon as the sound of the fight reached  them, came limping to the front--and plunged into the firing-line.  It  was the only place they could go--there was no other line.  With the  exception of Church's dressing station and its wounded there were no  reserves.    Among the first to be wounded was the correspondent, Edward Marshall, of  the New York _Journal_, who was on the firing-line to the left.  He was  shot through the body near the spine, and when I saw him he was suffering  the most terrible agonies, and passing through a succession of  convulsions.  He nevertheless, in his brief moments of comparative peace,  bore himself with the utmost calm, and was so much a soldier to duty that  he continued writing his account of the fight until the fight itself was  ended.  His courage was the admiration of all the troopers, and he was  highly commended by Colonel Wood in the official account of the  engagement.     [Picture: Wounded Rough Riders coming over the hill at Siboney.  Head of   column of Second Infantry going to support the Rough Riders, June 24th]    Nothing so well illustrated how desperately each man was needed, and how  little was his desire to withdraw, as the fact that the wounded lay where  they fell until the hospital stewards found them.  Their comrades did not  use them as an excuse to go to leave the firing-line.  I have watched  other fights, where the men engaged were quite willing to unselfishly  bear the wounded from the zone of danger.    The fight had now lasted an hour, and the line had reached a more open  country, with a slight incline upward toward a wood, on the edge of which  was a ruined house.  This house was a former distillery for  _aguardiente_, and was now occupied in force by the enemy.  Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt on the far left was moving up his men with  the intention of taking this house on the flank; Wood, who was all over  the line, had the same objective point in his mind.  The troop commanders  had a general idea that the distillery was the key to the enemy's  position, and were all working in that direction.  It was extremely  difficult for Wood and Roosevelt to communicate with the captains, and  after the first general orders had been given them they relied upon the  latter's intelligence to pull them through.  I do not suppose Wood, out  of the five hundred engaged, saw more than thirty of his men at any one  time.  When he had passed one troop, except for the noise of its volley  firing, it was immediately lost to him in the brush, and it was so with  the next.  Still, so excellent was the intelligence of the officers, and  so ready the spirit of the men, that they kept an almost perfect  alignment, as was shown when the final order came to charge in the open  fields.  The advance upon the ruined building was made in stubborn, short  rushes, sometimes in silence, and sometimes firing as we ran.  The order  to fire at will was seldom given, the men waiting patiently for the  officers' signal, and then answering in volleys.  Some of the men who  were twice Day's age begged him to let them take the enemy's impromptu  fort on the run, but he answered them tolerantly like spoiled children,  and held them down until there was a lull in the enemy's fire, when he  would lead them forward, always taking the advance himself.  By the way  they made these rushes, it was easy to tell which men were used to  hunting big game in the West and which were not.  The Eastern men broke  at the word, and ran for the cover they were directed to take like men  trying to get out of the rain, and fell panting on their faces, while the  Western trappers and hunters slipped and wriggled through the grass like  Indians; dodging from tree trunk to tree trunk, and from one bush to  another.  They fell into line at the same time with the others, but while  doing so they had not once exposed themselves.  Some of the escapes were  little short of miraculous.  The man on my right, Champneys Marshall, of  Washington, had one bullet pass through his sleeve, and another pass  through his shirt, where it"]]]
