The exhalation of  plants has recently been examined with great accuracy by Lawes. His  experiments were made by planting single plants of wheat, barley, beans,  peas, and clover, in large glass jars capable of holding about 42 lb. of  soil, and covered with glass plates, furnished with a hole in the centre  for the passage of the stem of the plant. Water was supplied to the soil  at certain intervals, and the jars were carefully weighed. The result of  the experiments, continued during a period of 172 days, is given in the  following table, which shows the total quantity of water exhaled in  grains:--    Wheat                    113,527  Barley                   120,025  Beans                    112,231  Peas                     109,082  Clover, cut 28th June     55,093    It further appears, that the exhalation is not uniform, but increases  during the active growth of the plant, and diminishes again when that  period is passed. These variations are shown by the subjoined tables, of  which the first gives the total exhalation, and the second the average  daily loss of water during certain periods.

Calculating from these experiments, we are led to the apparently  anomalous conclusion that the quantity of water exhaled by the plants  growing on an acre of land greatly exceeds the annual fall of rain;  although it is obvious that of all the rain which falls, only a small  proportion can be absorbed by the plants growing on the soil, for a  large quantity is carried off by the rivers, and never reaches their  roots. It has been calculated, for instance, that the Thames carries off  in this way at least one-third of the annual rain that falls in the  district watered by it, and the Rhine nearly four-fifths. Of course this  large exhalation must depend on the repeated absorption of the same  quantity of water, which, after being exhaled, is again deposited on the  soil in the form of dew, and passes repeatedly through the plant. This  constant percolation of water is of immense importance to the plant, as  it forms the channel through which some of its other constituents are  carried to it.    _Carbonic Acid._--While the larger part of the water which a plant  requires is absorbed by its roots, the reverse is the case with carbonic  acid. A certain proportion no doubt is carried up through the roots by  the water, which always contains a quantity of that gas in solution, but  by far the larger proportion is directly absorbed from the air by the  leaves. A simple experiment of Boussingault's illustrates this  absorption very strikingly. He took a large glass globe having three  apertures, through one of which he introduced the branch of a vine, with  twenty leaves on it. With one of the side apertures a tube was  connected, by means of which the air could be drawn slowly through the  globe, and into an apparatus in which its carbonic acid was accurately  determined. He found, in this way, that while the air which entered the  globe contained 0.0004 of carbonic acid, that which escaped contained  only 0.0001, so that three-fourths of the carbonic acid had been  absorbed.    _Ammonia and Nitric Acid._--Little is known regarding the mode in which  these substances enter the plant. It is usually supposed that they are  entirely absorbed by the roots, and no doubt the greater proportion is  taken up in this way, but it is very probable that they may also be  absorbed by the leaves, at least the addition of ammonia to the air in  which plants are grown, materially accelerates vegetation. It is  probable, however, that the rain carries down the ammonia to the roots,  and there is no doubt that that derived from the decomposition of the  nitrogenous matters in the soil is so absorbed.    _Inorganic Constituents._--The inorganic constituents of course are  entirely absorbed by the roots; and it is as a solvent for them that the  large quantity of water continually passing through the plants is so  important. They exist in the soil in particular states of combination,  in which they are scarcely soluble in water. But their solubility is  increased by the presence of carbonic acid contained in the water, and  which causes it to dissolve, to some extent, substances otherwise  insoluble. It is in this way that lime, which occurs in the soil  principally as the insoluble carbonate, is dissolved and absorbed. And  phosphate of lime is also taken up by water containing carbonic acid, or  even common salt in solution. The amount of solubility produced by these  substances is extremely small; but it is sufficient for the purpose of  supplying to the plant as much of its mineral constituents as are  required, for the quantity of water which, as we have already seen,  passes through a plant is very large when compared with the amount of  inorganic matters absorbed. It has been shown by Lawes and Gilbert, that  about 2000 grains of water pass through a plant for every grain of  mineral matter fixed in it, so that there is no difficulty in  understanding how the absorption takes place.    It is worthy of notice, however, that the absorption of the elements of  plants takes place even though they may not be in solution in the soil,  the roots apparently possessing the power of directly acting on and  dissolving insoluble matters; but a distinction must be drawn between  this and the view entertained by Jethro Tull, who supposed that they  might be absorbed in the solid state, provided they were reduced to a  state of sufficient comminution. It is now no longer doubted that,  whatever action the roots may exert, the constituents of the plant must  be in solution before they can pass into it--experiment having  distinctly shown that the spongioles or apertures through which this  absorption takes place are too minute to admit even the smallest solid  particle.          CHAPTER II.    THE PROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF PLANTS.      The substances absorbed by the plant, which are of simple composition,  and contain only two elements, are elaborated within it, and converted  into the many complicated compounds of which its mass is composed. Some  of these, as, for example, the colouring matters of madder and indigo,  the narcotic principle of the poppy, &c., are confined to a single  species, or small group of plants, while others are found in all plants,  and form the main bulk of their tissues. The latter are the only  substances which claim notice in a treatise like the present. They have  been divided into three great classes, of widely different properties,  composition, and functions.    _1st. The Saccharine and Amylaceous Constituents._--These substances are  compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and all possess a certain  degree of similarity in composition, the quantities of hydrogen and  oxygen they contain being always in the proportion required to form  water, so that they may be considered as compounds of carbon and water;  not that it can be asserted that they actually do contain water, as  such, for of that there is no evidence, but only that its elements are  present in the proportion to form it.    _Cellulose._--This substance forms the fundamental part of all plants.  It is the principal constituent of woody fibre, and is found in a state  of purity in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#8)"],[1,"the detectives and armed burghers occupied the town, and sixty of their  number were hurried to Pretoria Gaol.    To the raiders themselves the President behaved with generosity. Perhaps  he could not find it in his heart to be harsh to the men who had managed  to put him in the right and won for him the sympathy of the world. His  own illiberal and oppressive treatment of the new-comers was forgotten  in the face of this illegal inroad of filibusters. The true issues were  so obscured by this intrusion that it has taken years to clear them, and  perhaps they will never be wholly cleared. It was forgotten that it was  the bad government of the country which was the real cause of the  unfortunate raid. From then onwards the government might grow worse and  worse, but it was always possible to point to the raid as justifying  everything. Were the Uitlanders to have the franchise? How could they  expect it after the raid? Would Britain object to the enormous  importation of arms and obvious preparations for war? They were only  precautions against a second raid. For years the raid stood in the way,  not only of all progress, but of all remonstrance. Through an action  over which they had no control, and which they had done their best to  prevent, the British Government was left with a bad case and a weakened  moral authority.    The raiders were sent home, where the rank and file were very properly  released, and the chief officers were condemned to terms of imprisonment  which certainly did not err upon the side of severity. In the meantime,  both President Kruger and his burghers had shown a greater severity to  the political prisoners from Johannesburg than to the armed followers of  Jameson. The nationality of these prisoners is interesting and  suggestive. There were twenty-three Englishmen, sixteen South Africans,  nine Scotchmen, six Americans, two Welshmen, one Irishman, one  Australian, one Hollander, one Bavarian, one Canadian, one Swiss, and  one Turk. The list is sufficient comment upon the assertion that only  the British Uitlanders made serious complaints of subjection and  injustice. The prisoners were arrested in January, but the trial did not  take place until the end of April. All were found guilty of high  treason. Mr. Lionel Phillips, Colonel Rhodes (brother of Mr. Cecil  Rhodes), George Farrar, and Mr. Hammond, the American engineer, were  condemned to death, a sentence which was afterwards commuted to the  payment of an enormous fine. The other prisoners were condemned to two  years' imprisonment, with a fine of 2,000_l._ each. The imprisonment was  of the most arduous and trying sort, and was embittered by the harshness  of the gaoler, Du Plessis. One of the unfortunate men cut his throat,  and several fell seriously ill, the diet and the sanitary conditions  being equally unhealthy. At last, at the end of May, all the prisoners  but six were released. Four of the six soon followed, two stalwarts,  Sampson and Davies, refusing to sign any petition and remaining in  prison until they were set free in 1897. Altogether the Transvaal  Government received in fines from the reform prisoners the enormous sum  of 212,000_l._ A certain comic relief was immediately afterwards given  to so grave an episode by the presentation of a bill to Great Britain  for 1,677,938_l._ 3_s._ 3_d._--the greater part of which was under the  heading of moral and intellectual damage. It is to be feared that even  the 3_s._ 3_d._ remains still unpaid.    The raid was past and the reform movement was past, but the causes  which produced them both remained. It is hardly conceivable that a  statesman who loved his country would have refrained from making some  effort to remove a state of things which had already caused such grave  dangers, and which must obviously become more serious with every year  that passed. But Paul Kruger had hardened his heart, and was not to be  moved. The grievances of the Uitlanders became heavier than ever. The  one power in the land to which they had been able to appeal for some  sort of redress amid their troubles was the law courts. Now it was  decreed that the courts should be dependent on the Volksraad. The Chief  Justice protested against such a degradation of his high office, and he  was dismissed in consequence without a pension. The judge who had  condemned the reformers was chosen to fill the vacancy, and the  protection of a fixed law was withdrawn from the Uitlanders.    A commission appointed by the State was sent to examine into the  condition of the mining industry and the grievances from which the  new-comers suffered. The chairman was Mr. Schalk Burger, one of the most  liberal of the Boers, and the proceedings were thorough and impartial.  The result was a report which amply vindicated the reformers, and  suggested remedies which would have gone a long way towards satisfying  the Uitlanders. With such enlightened legislation their motives for  seeking the franchise would have been less pressing. But the President  and his Raad would have none of the recommendations of the commission.  The rugged old autocrat declared that Schalk Burger was a traitor to his  country for having signed such a document, and a new reactionary  committee was chosen to report upon the report. Words and papers were  the only outcome of the affair. No amelioration came to the new-comers.  But at least they had again put their case publicly upon record, and it  had been endorsed by the most respected of the burghers. Gradually in  the press of the English-speaking countries the raid was ceasing to  obscure the issue. More and more clearly it was coming out that no  permanent settlement was possible where half the population was  oppressed by the other half. They had tried peaceful means and failed.  They had tried warlike means and failed. What was there left for them to  do? Their own country, the paramount power of South Africa, had never  helped them. Perhaps if it were directly appealed to it might do so. It  could not, if only for the sake of its own imperial prestige, leave its  children for ever in a state of subjection. The small spark which caused  a final explosion came from the shooting of a British subject named  Edgar by a Boer policeman, Jones, in Johannesburg. The action of the  policeman was upheld by the authorities, and the British felt that their  lives were no longer safe in the presence of an armed overbearing  police. At another time the incident might have been of no great  importance, but at that moment it seemed to be taken as the crowning  example of the injustice under which the miners suffered. A meeting of  protest called by the British residents was broken up by gangs of  workmen under Boer officials. Driven to desperation the Uitlanders  determined upon a petition to Queen Victoria, and in doing so they  brought their grievances out of the limits of a local controversy into  the broader field of international politics. Great Britain must either  protect them or acknowledge that their protection was beyond her power.  A direct petition to the Queen praying for protection was signed in  April 1899 by 21,000 Uitlanders.    The lines which this historical petition took may be judged from the  following excerpt:    'The condition of Your Majesty's subjects in this State has indeed  become well-nigh intolerable.    'The acknowledged and admitted grievances of which Your Majesty's  subjects complained prior to 1895, not only are not redressed, but exist  to-day in an aggravated form. They are still deprived of all political  rights, they are denied any voice in the government of the country, they  are taxed far above the requirements of the country, the revenue of  which is misapplied and devoted to objects which keep alive a continuous  and well-founded feeling of irritation, without in any way advancing the  general interest of the State. Maladministration and peculation of  public moneys go hand-in-hand, without any vigorous measures being  adopted to put a stop to the scandal. The education of Uitlander  children is made subject to impossible conditions. The police afford no  adequate protection to the lives and property of the inhabitants of  Johannesburg; they are rather a source of danger to the peace and safety  of the Uitlander population.    'A further grievance has become prominent since the beginning of the  year. The power vested in the Government by means of the Public Meetings  Act has been a menace to Your Majesty's subjects since the enactment of  the Act in 1894. This power has now been applied in order to deliver a  blow that strikes at the inherent and inalienable birthright of every  British subject--namely, his right to petition his Sovereign. Straining  to the utmost the language and intention of the law, the Government have  arrested two British subjects who assisted in presenting a petition to  Your Majesty on behalf of four thousand fellow-subjects. Not content  with this, the Government, when Your Majesty's loyal subjects again  attempted to lay their grievances before Your Majesty, permitted their  meeting to be broken up, and the objects of it to be defeated, by a body  of Boers, organised by Government officials and acting under the  protection of the police. By reason, therefore, of the direct, as well  as the indirect, act of the Government, Your Majesty's loyal subjects  have been prevented from publicly ventilating their grievances, and from  laying them before Your Majesty.    'Wherefore Your Majesty's humble petitioners humbly beseech Your Most  Gracious Majesty to extend Your Majesty's protection to Your Majesty's  loyal subjects resident in this State, and to cause an inquiry to be  made into grievances and complaints enumerated and set forth in this  humble petition, and to direct Your Majesty's representative in South  Africa to take measures which will insure the speedy reform of the  abuses complained of, and to obtain"]]]
