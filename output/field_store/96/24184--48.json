All weighed  anchor from Falmouth early in June and sailed by the newly tried course,  south to the Canaries and then across. These seven ships carried five  hundred colonists, men, women, and children.    On St. James's day there rose and broke a fearsome storm. Two days and  nights it raged, and it scattered that fleet of seven. Gates, Somers,  and Newport with others of \"rancke and quality\" were upon the Sea  Adventure. How fared this ship with one attendant pinnace we shall come  to see presently. But the other ships, driven to and fro, at last found  a favorable wind, and in August they sighted Virginia. On the eleventh  of that month they came, storm-beaten and without Governor or Admiral  or Sea Adventure, into \"our Bay\" and at last to \"the King's River and  Town.\" Here there swarmed from these ships nigh three hundred persons,  meeting and met by the hundred dwelling at Jamestown. This was the third  supply, but it lacked the hundred or so upon the Sea Adventure and the  pinnace, and it lacked a head. \"Being put ashore without their Governor  or any order from him (all the Commissioners and principal persons being  aboard him) no man would acknowledge a superior.\"    With this multitude appeared once more in Virginia the three ancient  councilors--Ratcliffe, Archer, and Martin. Apparently here came fresh  fuel for factions. Who should rule, and who should be ruled? Here is  an extremely old and important question, settled in history only to be  unsettled again. Everywhere it rises, dust on Time's road, and is laid  only to rise again.    Smith was still President. Who was in the right and who in the wrong in  these ancient quarrels, the recital of which fills the pages of Smith  and of other men, is hard now to be determined. But Jamestown became a  place of turbulence. Francis West was sent with a considerable number to  the Falls of the Far West to make there some kind of settlement. For a  like purpose Martin and Percy were dispatched to the Nansemond River.  All along the line there was bitter falling out. The Indians became  markedly hostile. Smith was up the river, quarreling with West and his  men. At last he called them \"wrongheaded asses,\" flung himself into  his boat, and made down the river to Jamestown. Yet even so he found no  peace, for, while he was asleep in the boat, by some accident or other  a spark found its way to his powder pouch. The powder exploded. Terribly  hurt, he leaped overboard into the river, whence he was with difficulty  rescued.    Smith was now deposed by Ratcliffe, Archer, and Martin, because, \"being  an ambityous, onworthy, and vayneglorious fellowe,\" say his detractors,  \"he wolde rule all and ingrose all authority into his own hands.\" Be  this as it may, Smith was put on board one of the ships which were about  to sail for England. Wounded, and with none at Jamestown able to heal  his hurt, he was no unwilling passenger. Thus he departed, and Virginia  knew Captain John Smith no more. Some liked him and his ways, some liked  him not nor his ways either. He wrote of his own deeds and praised them  highly, and saw little good in other mankind, though here and there he  made an exception. Evident enough are faults of temper. But he had great  courage and energy and at times a lofty disinterestedness.    Again winter drew on at Jamestown, and with it misery on misery. George  Percy, now President, lay ill and unable to keep order. The multitude,  \"unbridled and heedless,\" pulled this way and that. Before the cold had  well begun, what provision there was in the storehouse became exhausted.  That stream of corn from the Indians in which the colonists had put  dependence failed to flow. The Indians themselves began systematically  to spoil and murder. Ratcliffe and fourteen with him met death while  loading his barge with corn upon the Pamunkey. The cold grew worse.  By midwinter there was famine. The four hundred--already noticeably  dwindled--dwindled fast and faster. The cold was severe; the Indians  were in the woods; the weakened bodies of the white men pined and  shivered. They broke up the empty houses to make fires to warm  themselves. They began to die of hunger as well as by Indian arrows.  On went the winter, and every day some died. Tales of cannibalism are  told....This was the Starving Time.    When the leaves were red and gold, England-in-America had a population  of four hundred and more. When the dogwood and the strawberry bloomed,  England-in-America had a population of but sixty.    Somewhat later than this time there came from the pen of Shakespeare a  play dealing with a tempest and shipwreck and a magical isle and rescue  thereon. The bright spirit Ariel speaks of \"the still-vex'd Bermoothes.\"  These were islands \"two hundred leagues from any continent,\" named after  a Spanish Captain Bermudez who had landed there. Once there had been  Indians, but these the Spaniards had slain or taken as slaves. Now the  islands were desolate, uninhabited, \"forlorn and unfortunate.\" Chance  vessels might touch, but the approach was dangerous. There grew rumors  of pirates, and then of demons. \"The Isles of Demons,\" was the name  given to them. \"The most forlorn and unfortunate place in the world\" was  the description that fitted them in those distant days:    All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement Inhabits here: some heavenly  power guide us Out of this fearful country.    When Shakespeare so wrote, there was news in England and talk went to  and fro of the shipwreck of the Sea Adventure upon the rocky teeth of  the Bermoothes, \"uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,\" and of the  escape and dwelling there for months of Gates and Somers and the  colonists in that ship. It is generally assumed that this incident  furnished timber for the framework of The Tempest.    The storm that broke on St. James's Day, scattering the ships of the  third supply, drove the Sea Adventure here and there at will. Upon her  watched Gates and Somers and Newport, above a hundred men, and a few  women and children. There sprang a leak; all thought of death. Then  rose a cry \"Land ho!\" The storm abated, but the wind carried the Sea  Adventure upon this shore and grounded her upon a reef. A certain R.  Rich, gentleman, one of the voyagers, made and published a ballad upon  the whole event. If it is hardly Shakespearean music, yet it is not  devoid of interest.    ... The Seas did rage, the windes did blowe,          Distressed were they then;       Their shippe did leake, her tacklings breake,          In daunger were her men;       But heaven was pylotte in this storme,          And to an Iland neare,       Bermoothawes called, conducted them,          Which did abate their feare.    Using the ship's boats they got to shore, though with toil and danger.  Here they found no sprites nor demons, nor even men, but a fair,  half-tropical verdure and, running wild, great numbers of swine.         And then on shoare the iland came          Inhabited by hogges,       Some Foule and tortoyses there were,          They only had one dogge,       To kill these swyne, to yield them foode,          That little had to eate.       Their store was spent and all things scant,          Alas! they wanted meate.         They did not, however, starve.         A thousand hogges that dogge did kill          Their hunger to sustaine.    Ten months the Virginia colonists lived among the \"still-vex'd  Bermoothes.\" The Sea Adventure was but a wreck pinned between the reefs.  No sail was seen upon the blue water. Where they were thrown, there  Gates and Somers and Newport and all must stay for a time and make the  best of it. They builded huts and thatched them, and they brought from  the wrecked ship, pinned but half a mile from land, stores of many  kinds. The clime proved of the blandest, fairest; with fishing and  hunting they maintained themselves. Days, weeks, and months went by.  They had a minister, Master Buck. They brought from the ship a bell and  raised it for a church-bell. A marriage, a few deaths, the birth of two  children these were events on the island. One of these children, the  daughter of John Rolfe, gentleman, and his wife, was christened Bermuda.  Gates and Somers held kindly sway. The colonists lived in plenty, peace,  and ease. But for all that, they were shipwrecked folk, and far, far out  of the world, and they longed for the old ways and their own kin. Day  followed day, but no sail would show to bear them thence; and so at  last, taking what they could from the forests of the island, and from  the Sea Adventure, they set about to become shipwrights.         And there two gallant pynases,          Did build of Seader-tree,       The brave Deliverance one was call'd,          Of seaventy tonne was shee,       The other Patience had to name,          Her burthen thirty tonne....    ... The two and forty weekes being past          They hoyst sayle and away;       Their shippes with hogges well freighted were,          Their harts with mickle joy.    And so to Virginia came...    What they found when they came to Virginia was dolor enough. On  Jamestown strand they beheld sixty skeletons \"who had eaten all the  quick things that weare there, and some of them had eaten snakes and  adders.\" Somers, Gates, and Newport, on entering the town, found it  \"rather as the ruins of some auntient fortification than that any people  living might now inhabit it.\"    A pitiable outcome, this, of all the hopes of fair \"harbours and  habitations,\" of golden dreams, and farflung dominion. All those whom  Raleigh had sent to Roanoke were lost or had perished. Those who had  named and had first dwelled in Jamestown were in number about a hundred.  To these had been added, during the first year or so, perhaps two  hundred more. And the ships that had parted from the Sea Adventure had  brought in three hundred."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#8)"],[1,"country.    Less sudden, less dramatic, than that of the cotton gin, was the  entrance of the steam engine on the American industrial stage, but not  less momentous. The actions and reactions of steam in America provide  the theme for an Iliad which some American Homer may one day write. They  include the epic of the coal in the Pennsylvania hills, the epic of  the ore, the epic of the railroad, the epic of the great city; and, in  general, the subjugation of a continental wilderness to the service of a  vast civilization.    The vital need of better transportation was uppermost in the thoughts of  many Americans. It was seen that there could be no national unity in a  country so far flung without means of easy intercourse between one group  of Americans and another. The highroads of the new country were, for the  most part, difficult even for the man on horseback, and worse for those  who must travel by coach or post-chaise. Inland from the coast and  away from the great rivers there were no roads of any sort; nothing but  trails. Highways were essential, not only for the permanent unity of the  United States, but to make available the wonderful riches of the inland  country, across the Appalachian barrier and around the Great Lakes, into  which American pioneers had already made their way.    Those immemorial pathways, the great rivers, were the main avenues of  traffic with the interior. So, of course, when men thought of improving  transportation, they had in mind chiefly transportation by water; and  that is why the earliest efforts of American inventors were applied to  the means of improving traffic and travel by water and not by land.    The first men to spend their time in trying to apply steam power to the  propulsion of a boat were contemporaries of Benjamin Franklin. Those who  worked without Watt's engine could hardly succeed. One of the earliest  of these was William Henry of Pennsylvania. Henry, in 1763, had the idea  of applying power to paddle wheels, and constructed a boat, but his  boat sank, and no result followed, unless it may be that John Fitch and  Robert Fulton, both of whom were visitors at Henry's house, received  some suggestions from him. James Rumsey of Maryland began experiments  as early as 1774 and by 1786 had a boat that made four miles an hour  against the current of the Potomac.    The most interesting of these early and unsuccessful inventors is John  Fitch, who, was a Connecticut clockmaker living in Philadelphia. He was  eccentric and irregular in his habits and quite ignorant of the steam  engine. But he conceived the idea of a steamboat and set to work to make  one. The record of Fitch's life is something of a tragedy. At the best  he was an unhappy man and was always close to poverty. As a young man he  had left his family because of unhappy domestic relations with his wife.  One may find in the record of his undertakings which he left in the  Philadelphia Library, to be opened thirty years after its receipt,  these words: \"I know of nothing so perplexing and vexatious to a man of  feelings as a turbulent Wife and Steamboat building.\" But in spite of  all his difficulties Fitch produced a steamboat, which plied regularly  on the Delaware for several years and carried passengers. \"We reigned  Lord High Admirals of the Delaware; and no other boat in the River  could hold its way with us,\" he wrote. \"Thus has been effected by  little Johnny Fitch and Harry Voight [one of his associates] one of the  greatest and most useful arts that has ever been introduced into the  world; and although the world and my country does not thank me for it,  yet it gives me heartfelt satisfaction.\" The \"Lord High Admirals of the  Delaware,\" however, did not reign long. The steamboat needed improvement  to make it pay; its backers lost patience and faith, and the inventor  gave up the fight and retired into the fastnesses of the Kentucky  wilderness, where he died.    The next inventor to struggle with the problem of the steamboat, with  any approach to success, was John Stevens of Hoboken. His life was cast  in a vastly different environment from that of John Fitch. He was a rich  man, a man of family and of influence. His father's house--afterwards  his own---at 7 Broadway, facing Bowling Green--was one of the mansions  of early New York, and his own summer residence on Castle Point,  Hoboken, just across the Hudson, was one of the landmarks of the great  river. For many years John Stevens crossed that river; most often in an  open boat propelled by sail or by men at the oars. Being naturally of a  mechanical turn, he sought to make the crossing easier. To his library  were coming the prints that told of James Watt and the steam engine in  England, and John Fitch's boat had interested him.    Robert Fulton's Clermont, of which we shall speak presently, was  undoubtedly the pioneer of practicable steamboats. But the Phoenix,  built by John Stevens, followed close on the Clermont. And its engines  were built in America, while those of the Clermont had been imported  from England. Moreover, in June, 1808, the Phoenix stood to sea, and  made the first ocean voyage in the history of steam navigation. Because  of a monopoly of the Hudson, which the New York Legislature had granted  to Livingston and Fulton, Stevens was compelled to send his ship to the  Delaware. Hence the trip out into the waters of the Atlantic, a journey  that was not undertaken without trepidation. But, despite the fact that  a great storm arose, the Phoenix made the trip in safety; and continued  for many years thereafter to ply the Delaware between Philadelphia and  Trenton.    Robert Fulton, like many and many another great inventor, from Leonardo  da Vinci down to the present time, was also an artist. He was born  November 14, 1765, at Little Britain, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,  of that stock which is so often miscalled \"Scotch-Irish.\" He was only a  child when his father died, leaving behind him a son who seems to have  been much more interested in his own ideas than in his schoolbooks. Even  in his childhood Robert showed his mechanical ability. There was a firm  of noted gunsmiths in Lancaster, in whose shops he made himself at home  and became expert in the use of tools. At the age of fourteen he  applied his ingenuity to a heavy fishing boat and equipped it with  paddle-wheels, which were turned by a crank, thus greatly lightening the  labor of moving it.    At the age of seventeen young Fulton moved to Philadelphia and set up as  a portrait painter. Some of the miniatures which he painted at this  time are said to be very good. He worked hard, made many good friends,  including Benjamin Franklin, and succeeded financially. He determined  to go to Europe to study--if possible under his fellow Pennsylvanian,  Benjamin West, then rising into fame in London. The West and the Fulton  families had been intimate, and Fulton hoped that West would take him as  a pupil. First buying a farm for his mother with a part of his savings,  he sailed for England in 1786, with forty guineas in his pocket.  West received him not only as a pupil but as a guest in his house and  introduced him to many of his friends. Again Fulton succeeded, and in  1791 two of his portraits were exhibited at the Royal Academy, and the  Royal Society of British Artists hung four paintings by him.    Then came the commission which changed the course of Fulton's life.  His work had attracted the notice of Viscount Courtenay, later Earl  of Devon, and he was invited to Devonshire to paint that nobleman's  portrait. Here he met Francis, third Duke of Bridgewater, the father  of the English canal system, and his hardly less famous engineer, James  Brindley, and also Earl Stanhope, a restless, inquiring spirit. Fulton  the mechanic presently began to dominate Fulton the artist. He studied  canals, invented a means of sawing marble in the quarries, improved  the wheel for spinning flax, invented a machine for making rope, and a  method of raising canal boats by inclined planes instead of locks. What  money he made from these inventions we do not know, but somewhat later  (1796) he speaks hopefully of an improvement in tanning. This same year  he published a pamphlet entitled \"A Treatise on the Improvement of  Canal Navigation\", copies of which were sent to Napoleon and President  Washington.    Fulton went to France in 1797. To earn money he painted several  portraits and a panorama of the Burning of Moscow. This panorama,  covering the walls of a circular hall built especially for it, became  very popular, and Fulton painted another. In Paris he formed a warm  friendship with that singular American, Joel Barlow, soldier, poet,  speculator, and diplomatist, and his wife, and for seven years lived in  their house.    The long and complicated story of Fulton's sudden interest in torpedoes  and submarine boats, his dealings with the Directory and Napoleon and  with the British Admiralty does not belong here. His experiments and his  negotiations with the two Governments occupied the greater part of his  time for the years between 1797 and 1806. His expressed purpose was  to make an engine of war so terrible that war would automatically  be abolished. The world, however, was not ready for diving boats and  torpedoes, nor yet for the end of war, and his efforts had no tangible  results.*         * The submarine was the invention of David Bushnell, a       Connecticut Yankee, whose \"American Turtle\" blew up at least       one British vessel in the War of Independence and created       much consternation among the King's ships in American       waters.    During all the years after 1793, at least, and perhaps earlier, the idea  of the steamboat had seldom been out of his mind, but lack of funds and  the greater urgency, as he thought, of the submarine prevented him from  working seriously upon it. In 1801, however, Robert R. Livingston  came to"]]]
