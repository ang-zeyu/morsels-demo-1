We have each read of Scott's Maida. And if some, perhaps, have  made a pilgrimage to that long and narrow mound in the vale of Gwyant  which, according to tradition, marks the resting-place of the immortal  Gelert, others have read of the faithful Vigr who never again tasted food  when he learnt that Olaf, his master, lay dead.    The stories are without end; and romance knows no limits when dealing  with the subject. The lives of the Man and the Dog are found to be ever  intertwined. Yet is there always this besides--the rift in the lute and  the familiar refrain, that the life of the dog shall be short, and that  Man shall go on his way with his head bent, till such time as he shall  become rich once more in the love of a new-found friend--if that be  always possible.    No man, it has been well said, can be deemed unhappy who possesses the  love of a dog; and none are too poor to win it, as none are too high to  rejoice and grow glad in it. The dog, at least, knows no difference of  class or place in his attachments. To him his home is his home; his  master, his master and friend, whether his lot be to follow the tramp on  the road, or to walk behind a king to the tomb. And perhaps it may be due  to the mystery lying at the back of this wonderful intimacy and  connection, stretching far back into an altogether hidden past, that to  strike another man's dog unjustly is equivalent to striking him; that to  hurt a dog with intent is to earn the worst of characters and to stain  one's kind; and that for a dog to be in trouble and claim aid is for him  to claim also the man's heart--even, as has many a time occurred, the  man's life--to the infinite glory of both.    Nor has it been only on man's side that such deeds of heroism have been  exhibited. The man, the woman, and the child have undoubtedly gone to the  dog's help at the risk of their own lives on many an occasion; but so  also has the dog risked his for the sake of the man--not from any moral  claim, not because life is a precious thing and must be saved, not  because of that power which impels, and whose chief gift is the sense of  after-satisfaction that comes even to the most disinterested; such things  lie necessarily beyond the reach of the dog mind. What the dog does is  done for love, because of his faith, and because, unlike any other living  animal, he thinks, in his unselfishness, more of his friend than he ever  does about himself.    On the shores of a lake in Travancore, not far from the remote cantonment  of Quillon, stands a monument to the memory of a dog. He was left to  watch his master's clothes while bathing. Presently he was seen to be  doing everything in his power to attract attention, by barking and  running excitedly backwards and forwards on the shore. An advancing  ripple was then discerned on the smooth surface of the lake, and the next  instant the meaning of this flashed home. A crocodile had got between the  swimmer and the landing-place, and was coming out to seize his prey. Hope  might well have been stricken dead in the face of such a situation. But  the dog did not hesitate. Plunging into the water, he swam out to get  between the horrid reptile and his master, and thus to head him off. It  meant his own certain death; but the saving of his master's life. A  moment later there was a violent agitation of the water, and the dog had  disappeared for ever. Thus there stands to record his splendid action  this well-known monument, erected by his master in deepest gratitude, and  that passers-by might learn of what a dog is capable.    The incident is not the only one of its kind, and may be left to speak  for itself. But the influence of that one act has probably been  world-wide; and it is because of the exhibition of such qualities that  the moral power of the dog reaches to greater lengths than is generally  supposed. There is indeed ample evidence for believing that the beauties  often traceable in the character of the dog re-act unconsciously, and for  infinite good, upon the roughest of our own kind--by claiming  unselfishness from those who otherwise may lay claim to possessing  little; by showing what love may be under stress and strain, hardship and  rough fare; by the exhibition of patience and faithfulness; by those  instincts that make the most depraved of lookers-on pause and think, and  ask the question sharply--\"Whence that?\"    In Kingsley's _Hypatia_, Raphael Ben Azra, his head filled with a false  philosophy, is made again and again to act otherwise than he would by the  mastiff Bran.    The \"dog looks up in his face as only a dog can,\" and causes him to  follow her and to retrace his steps against his will. There are her  puppies. Is she to leave them to their fate? He tells her to choose  between the ties of family and duty: it is a specious form of appeal. To  her, duties begin with the family; the puppies cannot be left behind. Nor  can she carry them herself. She takes Raphael by the skirt, after  bringing the puppies to him one by one. He must carry them, she tells  him; and once again he finds himself doing the opposite of what he would:  the puppies are transferred to his blanket, and he and his dog go forward  together.    \"After all,\" he says to himself, \"these have as good a right to live as I  have.... Forward! whither you will, old lady. The world is wide. You  shall be my guide, tutor, queen of philosophy, for the sake of this mere  common-sense of yours.\"    He tramps on after that, \"trying to get the dog's lessons by heart.\" He  catches himself asking the dog's advice, till he exclaims irritably,  \"Hang these brute instincts! They make one very hot.\"    At last, by the dog's means and the example of energy that she sets, he  is instrumental in effecting the rescue of Victoria's father. Then, as  the distracted girl throws herself at his feet, and calls him \"her  saviour and deliverer sent by God,\" even Ben Azra has to admit that the  credit is not in reality his. \"Not in the least, my child,\" he exclaims.  \"You must thank my teacher, the dog, not me.\"    The experiences of the philosopher in the novel are only those of many in  real life. Man is not the only civilising agent in this world of many  mysteries. And if we often exclaim, \"Bother the dog!\" we have still very  frequently to follow where he leads, and often to our most definite  enrichment in the end.                                             VII      It was four months before any improvement was discernible: it was a year  before confidence could really be said to have grown at all. In some  directions it never grew. For instance, of labouring men, gardeners, and  the like, Murphy always remained shy. It was in no spirit of  unforgivingness, for he was perfectly civil; neither did he owe them any  grudge, grudges being forbidden usually by dog law and only entertained  by the poorest characters of all. Thus he never became familiar, even  with those he met daily: his memory was phenomenal, and by passing by on  the other side he showed that his associations in this direction were  unhappy.    It fell to this dog's lot to live a very quiet life and to be thrown with  few--either dogs or men. His days were regulated by his master's doings,  and these again were regulated, of necessity, by method. The weeks came,  and ran their course, and did not vary very greatly one from the other.  There was the daily round of work--almost incessant work, life being  supportable that way and in no other. There was the break, half-way  through the morning, of a run of a quarter of an hour, wet or shine.  There was the walk across country in the afternoon, also totally  irrespective of the weather. There was the turn at night under similar  conditions. That was the dog's day in winter-time; perhaps also the  man's. In spring and summer both lived under the sky, and regarded a  house only as a place to sleep in. Habit is second nature. Interests were  many, and in some directions ran parallel--sporting instincts,  especially, being quite ineradicable. Life for both was thus exceeding  happy; and life grew always happier with friendship: that is as it should  be.    With those he met Murphy was genial, if shy. He grew to love the members  of his little home circle; though three of the quartet ever averred that,  in reality, he only loved one wholly and altogether, and clung to him in  a way that others noticed--folk on the land always referring to them, the  country over, as \"Him and his dog.\"    Were they not always together? The shepherds on the downs recognised them  at great distances, for shepherds see far. The shepherds' dogs knew them  equally well, and they see furthest. The ploughmen in the hollows caught  sight of them against the skyline in the waning winter day, when the team  grew weary as they themselves--which last fact, too, made these best of  men shout with full lungs, \"Please, will you tell us the time!\" The man  with the hand-drill sowing the spring seeds; the poorer folk, men and  women with their buckets, stone-picking in the chill, autumnal weather;  the stockmen as they drove the cattle home, or called them from the lush  fields with the crack of a whip--spring-time and harvest, all the seasons  through; in wind and rain, in the great heat, in the snow and the  blizzard, it was always the same. And thus, in this unenclosed country,  where there were great woods, but where hedges were almost non-existent,  the men of the land would look up and pass the remark to their mates,  with a jerk of the head, \"Ther's 'im an' 'is dog; see?\"    Outside the home circle--though, to be sure, a dog is, or should always  be considered, a part of the family--Murphy's passion was for Dan. He  invariably got up when Dan entered the room, and often licked him many  times upon the lips: he paid him every kind of attention; bullied him to  play when out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],[0,"The Story of Leather (#8)"],[1,"rabid of them.    Drawn by an irresistible impulse Peter elbowed his way into the midst of  the workmen.    \"I am sure Mr. Coddington will listen to you,\" he ejaculated earnestly.  \"Choose your men and let them go to him. Give him a chance to see your  side of it. He will be reasonable--I know he will.\"    \"It's the Little Giant,\" said one man to another.    \"Put it to vote,\" urged Peter. \"Come! How many are for going to Mr.  Coddington? You fellows do not want a strike. Think what it would mean!\"    \"The lad's right. Up with the hands!\"    It was a crisis.    Peter trembled from head to foot.    A few hands were raised, then slowly a few more; more came. All over the  field they shot into the air.    \"And now choose your representatives,\" called Peter quickly, dreading  lest the tide of sentiment should turn.    \"Carmachel! He doesn't seem to fear losing his job,\" piped a voice. \"Put  on Carmachel!\"    \"And Jackson; he said he would not strike anyway,\" called somebody else.    \"Bryant is a good fellow! Put Bryant on.\"    \"Put on some men from the other factories, too,\" demanded a Pole  aggressively.    A committee of twelve were chosen.    \"Add the Little Giant as the thirteenth--just for luck!\" laughed a  knee-staker.    There was a cry of approval.    \"The Little Giant! The Little Giant!\" rose in a chorus.    \"No! No, indeed! I couldn't!\" Peter protested violently.    \"Of course you could!\" contradicted Carmachel. \"Come, come! You mustn't  be so modest, Strong. You are with us for keeping the field, aren't  you?\"    \"Yes. But there are reasons that you don't understand why I  couldn't----\"    \"Pooh! What reasons?\"    \"I can't tell you. But I couldn't possibly go to Mr. Coddington with the  men--I couldn't, really, Carmachel,\" reiterated Peter miserably.    \"Nonsense! The only question is this--is your sympathy with us or isn't  it?\"    \"Of course it is!\" There was no doubting the fervor of the avowal.    \"Then that settles it. Although you have come here but recently, Strong,  we all consider you a friend and count you as one of ourselves. You'll  stand by the bunch, won't you?\" Carmachel scrutinized Peter sharply.    \"Yes, I will. But you don't understand the circumstances or you would  never urge me to----\"    Carmachel interrupted him.    \"I guess I understand the circumstances better than you think,\" returned  he, dryly. \"Mr. Coddington got you your place, I've heard. Naturally you  feel under obligations to him for his kindness. That's all very well.  But has he ever been near you since he put you into the tannery? No! He  sits in his office and opens his mail and you are just a boy in the  works. Isn't that so? What's to hinder you from going respectfully to  him with the rest of us and calling to his attention something which  seems to us an injustice? You said yourself it was the best plan. You  pleaded with us to do it.\"    \"I know.\"    \"Then why won't you go yourself? You're not a coward, Strong, nor,  unless I greatly mistake, are you the sort of chap who would point out  to others a path he wouldn't dare follow himself.\"    \"I'll go!\" cried Peter suddenly. \"I'll go, but I will not do any  speaking.\"    \"Nobody wants you to speak,\" growled an Italian who had been standing  near and who had overheard the conversation. \"Bryant, Carmachel, and the  older men will do the speaking. It's their place.\"    So it was agreed.    Events shaped themselves rapidly. Within an hour Mr. Coddington, seated  in his perfectly appointed office, received word that a deputation of  his men respectfully requested an interview with him that afternoon.    He was thunderstruck.    What did the demand foreshadow? Was a strike brewing? The men had  appeared perfectly satisfied with the working conditions at the  tanneries. Wages were fairly high and the factories conformed to every  requirement of the Health and Labor Laws.    He touched a bell.    \"Ask Tyler to step here,\" said he, frowning.    Mr. Tyler entered hastily.    \"What's all this, Tyler?\" demanded his chief. \"I hear the men want to  see me.\"    \"I know nothing about it, sir. They've kept their own council. If they  have a grievance they have not told me.\"    \"No labor agitators have been in town recently?\"    \"Not to my knowledge, Mr. Coddington.\"    \"That will do.\"    Tyler went out.    Again Mr. Coddington rang.    \"I will see the men at three o'clock,\" he said to a messenger.    Left alone the president paced the floor. Business was good. The books  showed a quantity of unfilled orders. It would be an awkward time for a  strike.    \"Undoubtedly I could get strike-breakers from Chicago,\" he murmured  aloud, \"but it would take time. Besides, I do not want my men to walk  out. Think of the years many of them have worked here! The town will be  full of idle persons and suffering families. I have never had a strike  in all the history of my business. I've always tried to do what was fair  toward those who were in my employ. That is what cuts--to be square  with your men and then have them meet you with ingratitude. Why, I would  have staked my oath that they would have stood by me. I'm  disappointed--disappointed!\"    With such unpleasant reflections as companions three o'clock came none  too speedily for Mr. Coddington. The men were ushered promptly into the  office and the door closed. Then an awkward silence ensued. Nobody knew  exactly whose place it was to speak first.    But if the tanners had expected the president of the company to break  the ice and open the interview they had missed their calculations, for  he did no such thing. He met their gaze firmly, courteously, but  silently.    Peter, who stood at the back of the room behind the older workmen, saw  in his father's face an unaccustomed sternness and felt instinctively  that their mission was destined to failure.    It was Bryant who at last summoned courage to begin the conference.    \"Mr. Coddington,\" he said, \"we men have come to you because we wish to  hear the truth concerning a rumor that has reached us. We come  respectfully. You are our chief--the one who, in the past, has always  been fair and square with us. It is because of your justice that we  address you now. Is it true that you propose to take the vacant field  opposite Factory 1 for the site of a new building?\"    As Mr. Coddington drew a sigh of relief he inclined his head.    \"You have been correctly informed,\" he assented. \"We need more room. The  land is lying idle with a tax to be paid yearly upon it. It seems to me  an economic plan to utilize the space for a new factory in which the  patent leather department may be housed.\"    \"Did you realize, in deciding, that the field you intend to take is the  recreation ground of the men in your mills?\" asked Bryant.    \"I know that some of the men play ball there,\" replied Mr. Coddington,  smiling.    \"And yet you have decided to take it in spite of that fact?\"    The president stiffened.    \"The land,\" said he, \"is mine, and the taxes I annually pay on it render  it rather a costly spot for a ball field. For years the lot has been  nothing but an expense to me. If the case were yours and you could  derive an income from property where previously all had been outgo  wouldn't you do it?\"    \"But do you need that income, Mr. Coddington?\" cut in one of the men.  \"Isn't the Coddington Company rich? Must rich men go on getting more and  more, and never think of those who coin their money for them?\"    It was an unwise speech, and its effect was electrical.    \"I will try and believe that you men came here with the intention of  being courteous,\" observed Mr. Coddington with frigid politeness. \"My  affairs, however, are mine and not yours. I must deal with them in the  way that I consider wisest. You hardly realize, I think, that you are  over-stepping the bounds of propriety when you attempt to dictate to me  what I shall do with my land, or how I shall manage my tanneries.\"    The sternness of the answer blocked any possible reply.    Amid the silence of the room one could almost hear the heart-beats of  the waiting throng.    Then some one in the crowd made his way to the front of the room and  faced the president.    It was Peter Strong.    As Mr. Coddington's gaze fell on his son he started.    The boy stood erect and looked his father squarely in the eye.    \"May I speak, sir?\"    Mr. Coddington bowed.    Peter began gently, respectfully, and his words were without defiance.    [Illustration: \"MAY I SPEAK, SIR?\"]    \"I hardly think you know what the field you are going to take from the  men--from us all--means, sir. Not only do we play ball and go there to  eat our luncheon but each noon time we have a chance to get a breath of  fresh air and go back to work better in consequence. The field,  moreover, is the only open lot in this part of the town. At night  hundreds of men who have worked hard all day congregate there to get  sight of the green grass and enjoy a little interval of quiet. They  bring their families from the huddled districts where there is neither  sky, tree, nor breathing space. Suppose you lived as they do? Suppose  when you went home at night it was to a tenement in a crowded part of  the city? You return to a big house on the top of a hill where the trees  catch every breeze that passes; where there are shrubs, gardens,  flowers. Who needs this space more--you or your employees?\"    When he began to speak, Peter had had no clear idea of what he should  say; but as he went on words came to him. Was not he himself one of  these working men who knew what the heat, the odor, the noise of the  tanneries meant? As he went on his voice vibrated with earnestness.  There was no doubting his sincerity. It was in truth Peter Strong and  not Peter Coddington who made the appeal.    As Mr. Coddington listened without comment to the speech his  wordlessness was an enigma to the men. It seemed as if it was a silence  of suppressed anger and in consternation Carmachel"]]]
