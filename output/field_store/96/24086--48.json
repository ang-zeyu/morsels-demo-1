The habit of being unable to recognise merit until it is  dead is too apt to be the result of a purely bookish life, and a  culture based wholly on the past will seldom be able to pierce through  everyday surroundings to the essential splendour of contemporary  things, or to the hope of still greater splendour in the future.        \"My eyes saw not the men of old;      And now their age away has rolled.      I weep--to think I shall not see      The heroes of posterity.\"    So says the Chinese poet; but such impartiality is rare in the more  pugnacious atmosphere of the West, where the champions of past and  future fight a never-ending battle, instead of combining to seek out  the merits of both.    This consideration, which militates not only against the exclusive  study of the classics, but against every form of culture which has  become static, traditional, and academic, leads inevitably to the  fundamental question: What is the true end of education? But before  attempting to answer this question it will be well to define the sense  in which we are to use the word \"education.\" For this purpose I shall  distinguish the sense in which I mean to use it from two others, both  perfectly legitimate, the one broader and the other narrower than the  sense in which I mean to use the word.    In the broader sense, education will include not only what we learn  through instruction, but all that we learn through personal  experience--the formation of character through the education of life.  Of this aspect of education, vitally important as it is, I will say  nothing, since its consideration would introduce topics quite foreign  to the question with which we are concerned.    In the narrower sense, education may be confined to instruction, the  imparting of definite information on various subjects, because such  information, in and for itself, is useful in daily life. Elementary  education--reading, writing, and arithmetic--is almost wholly of this  kind. But instruction, necessary as it is, does not _per se_  constitute education in the sense in which I wish to consider it.    Education, in the sense in which I mean it, may be defined as _the  formation, by means of instruction, of certain mental habits and a  certain outlook on life and the world_. It remains to ask ourselves,  what mental habits, and what sort of outlook, can be hoped for as the  result of instruction? When we have answered this question we can  attempt to decide what science has to contribute to the formation of  the habits and outlook which we desire.    Our whole life is built about a certain number--not a very small  number--of primary instincts and impulses. Only what is in some way  connected with these instincts and impulses appears to us desirable or  important; there is no faculty, whether \"reason\" or \"virtue\" or  whatever it may be called, that can take our active life and our hopes  and fears outside the region controlled by these first movers of all  desire. Each of them is like a queen-bee, aided by a hive of workers  gathering honey; but when the queen is gone the workers languish and  die, and the cells remain empty of their expected sweetness. So with  each primary impulse in civilised man: it is surrounded and protected  by a busy swarm of attendant derivative desires, which store up in its  service whatever honey the surrounding world affords. But if the  queen-impulse dies, the death-dealing influence, though retarded a  little by habit, spreads slowly through all the subsidiary impulses,  and a whole tract of life becomes inexplicably colourless. What was  formerly full of zest, and so obviously worth doing that it raised no  questions, has now grown dreary and purposeless: with a sense of  disillusion we inquire the meaning of life, and decide, perhaps, that  all is vanity. The search for an outside meaning that can _compel_ an  inner response must always be disappointed: all \"meaning\" must be at  bottom related to our primary desires, and when they are extinct no  miracle can restore to the world the value which they reflected upon  it.    The purpose of education, therefore, cannot be to create any primary  impulse which is lacking in the uneducated; the purpose can only be to  enlarge the scope of those that human nature provides, by increasing  the number and variety of attendant thoughts, and by showing where the  most permanent satisfaction is to be found. Under the impulse of a  Calvinistic horror of the \"natural man,\" this obvious truth has been  too often misconceived in the training of the young; \"nature\" has been  falsely regarded as excluding all that is best in what is natural, and  the endeavour to teach virtue has led to the production of stunted and  contorted hypocrites instead of full-grown human beings. From such  mistakes in education a better psychology or a kinder heart is  beginning to preserve the present generation; we need, therefore,  waste no more words on the theory that the purpose of education is to  thwart or eradicate nature.    But although nature must supply the initial force of desire, nature is  not, in the civilised man, the spasmodic, fragmentary, and yet violent  set of impulses that it is in the savage. Each impulse has its  constitutional ministry of thought and knowledge and reflection,  through which possible conflicts of impulses are foreseen, and  temporary impulses are controlled by the unifying impulse which may be  called wisdom. In this way education destroys the crudity of  instinct, and increases through knowledge the wealth and variety of  the individual's contacts with the outside world, making him no longer  an isolated fighting unit, but a citizen of the universe, embracing  distant countries, remote regions of space, and vast stretches of past  and future within the circle of his interests. It is this simultaneous  softening in the insistence of desire and enlargement of its scope  that is the chief moral end of education.    Closely connected with this moral end is the more purely intellectual  aim of education, the endeavour to make us see and imagine the world  in an objective manner, as far as possible as it is in itself, and not  merely through the distorting medium of personal desire. The complete  attainment of such an objective view is no doubt an ideal,  indefinitely approachable, but not actually and fully realisable.  Education, considered as a process of forming our mental habits and  our outlook on the world, is to be judged successful in proportion as  its outcome approximates to this ideal; in proportion, that is to say,  as it gives us a true view of our place in society, of the relation of  the whole human society to its non-human environment, and of the  nature of the non-human world as it is in itself apart from our  desires and interests. If this standard is admitted, we can return to  the consideration of science, inquiring how far science contributes to  such an aim, and whether it is in any respect superior to its rivals  in educational practice.      II    Two opposite and at first sight conflicting merits belong to science  as against literature and art. The one, which is not inherently  necessary, but is certainly true at the present day, is hopefulness  as to the future of human achievement, and in particular as to the  useful work that may be accomplished by any intelligent student. This  merit and the cheerful outlook which it engenders prevent what might  otherwise be the depressing effect of another aspect of science, to my  mind also a merit, and perhaps its greatest merit--I mean the  irrelevance of human passions and of the whole subjective apparatus  where scientific truth is concerned. Each of these reasons for  preferring the study of science requires some amplification. Let us  begin with the first.    In the study of literature or art our attention is perpetually riveted  upon the past: the men of Greece or of the Renaissance did better than  any men do now; the triumphs of former ages, so far from facilitating  fresh triumphs in our own age, actually increase the difficulty of  fresh triumphs by rendering originality harder of attainment; not only  is artistic achievement not cumulative, but it seems even to depend  upon a certain freshness and _naïveté_ of impulse and vision which  civilisation tends to destroy. Hence comes, to those who have been  nourished on the literary and artistic productions of former ages, a  certain peevishness and undue fastidiousness towards the present, from  which there seems no escape except into the deliberate vandalism which  ignores tradition and in the search after originality achieves only  the eccentric. But in such vandalism there is none of the simplicity  and spontaneity out of which great art springs: theory is still the  canker in its core, and insincerity destroys the advantages of a  merely pretended ignorance.    The despair thus arising from an education which suggests no  pre-eminent mental activity except that of artistic creation is wholly  absent from an education which gives the knowledge of scientific  method. The discovery of scientific method, except in pure  mathematics, is a thing of yesterday; speaking broadly, we may say  that it dates from Galileo. Yet already it has transformed the world,  and its success proceeds with ever-accelerating velocity. In science  men have discovered an activity of the very highest value in which  they are no longer, as in art, dependent for progress upon the  appearance of continually greater genius, for in science the  successors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one  man of supreme"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#8)"],[1,"of  leather from a drawer began to polish off the finger-marks left upon the  steel.    \"I said five o'clock, Ben,\" cried the boy, very decisively.    \"Nay, Master Roy, you give it up, sir.  I'm too rough an old chap for  you.\"    \"Sorry I was so disagreeable, Ben,\" said the boy, offering his hand.    \"Mean it, sir?\"    \"Why, of course, Ben.\"    The hand was eagerly seized, and, it being understood that the sword  practice was to begin punctually at six next morning, they separated.        CHAPTER FIVE.    ROY TAKES HIS NEXT LESSON.    The clock in the little turret which stood out over the gate-way facing  Lady Royland's garden had not done striking six when Roy entered the  armoury next morning, to find Ben hard at work fitting the interior of a  light helmet with a small leather cap which was apparently well stuffed  with wool.    \"Morning, Ben,\" said the boy.  \"What's that for?\"    \"You, sir.\"    \"To wear?\"    \"Of course.  Just as well to take care of your face and head when you're  handling swords.  You can use it with the visor up or down, 'cording to  what we're doing.  You see, I want to learn you how to use a sword like  a soldier, and not like a gentleman who never expects to see trouble.\"    \"Ready?\"    \"Yes, sir, quite; and first thing 's morning we'll begin where we left  off, and you shall try to learn that you don't know how to thrust.  Nothing like finding out how bad you are.  Then you can begin to see  better what you have to learn.\"    \"Very well,\" said Roy, eagerly.  \"You'll have to look out now then, Ben,  for I mean to learn, and pretty quickly.\"    \"Oh, yes; you'll learn quickly enough,\" said Ben, placing the helmet  upon the table and taking the pair of sticks up from where he had placed  them.  \"But say, Master Roy, I have been working here.  Don't you think  the place looks better?\"    \"I think my father would be proud of the armoury if he could see the  weapons,\" said Roy, as he looked round.  \"Everything is splendid.\"    The old soldier smiled as he walked from suit to suit of armour, some of  which were obsolete, and could only be looked upon as curiosities of the  day; but, in addition, there were modern pieces of defensive armour,  beautifully made, with carefully cleaned and inlaid headpieces of the  newest kind, and of those the old soldier seemed to be especially proud.  Then he led the way on to the stands of offensive weapons, which  numbered quaint, massive swords of great age, battle-axes, and maces,  and so on to modern weapons of the finest steel, with, guns, petronels,  and horse-pistols of clumsy construction, but considered perfect then.    \"Yes, sir, I'm proud of our weepuns,\" said Ben; \"but I aren't a bit  proud of the old castle, which seems to be going right away to ruin.\"    \"That it isn't,\" cried Roy, indignantly.  \"It has been repaired and  repaired, whenever it wanted doing up, again and again.\"    \"Ah! you're thinking about roofs and tiles and plaster, my lad.  I was  thinking about the defences.  Such a place as this used to be.  Look at  the gun-carriages,--haven't been painted for years, nor the guns  cleaned.\"    \"Well, mix up some paint and brush it on,\" said Roy, \"and clean up the  guns.  They can't be rusty, because they're brass.\"    \"Well, not brass exactly, sir,\" said the man, thoughtfully.  \"It's more  of a mixtur' like; but to a man like me, sir, it's heart-breaking.\"    \"What! to see them turn green and like bronze?\"    \"Oh, I don't mind that so much, sir; it's seeing of 'em come down so  much, like.  Why, there's them there big guns as stands in the  court-yard behind the breastwork.\"    \"Garden, Ben.\"    \"Well, garden, sir.  Why, there's actooally ivy and other 'nockshus  weeds growing all over 'em.\"    \"Well, it looks peaceful and nice.\"    \"Bah!  A gun can't look peaceful and nice.  But that aren't the worst of  it, sir.  I was along by 'em a bit ago, and, if you'll believe me, when  I put my hand in one, if there warn't a sharp, hissing noise!\"    \"A snake?  Got in there?\"    \"Snake, sir?  No!  I wouldn't ha' minded a snake; but there's no snakes  here.\"    \"There was one, Ben, for I brought it up out of the woods, and kept it  in a box for months, till it got away.  Then that's where it is.\"    \"Nay.  It were no snake, sir.  It were one of them little blue and  yaller tomtit chaps as lays such lots o' eggs.  I fetches a stick, and I  was going to shove it in and twist it in the hay and stuff o' the nest  and draw it out.\"    \"But you didn't?\"    \"No, sir, I didn't; for I says to myself, if Sir Granby and her ladyship  like the place to go to ruin, they may let it; and if the two little  birds--there was a cock and hen--didn't bring up twelve of the rummiest  little, tiny young uns I ever did see.  There they was, all a-sitting in  a row along the gun, and it seemed to me so comic for 'em to be there  that I bust out a-laughing quite loud.\"    \"And they all flew away?\"    \"Nay, sir, they didn't; they stopped there a-twittering.  But if that  gun had been loaded, and I'd touched it off with a fire-stick, it would  have warmed their toes, eh?  But would you clean up the old guns?\"    \"I don't see why you shouldn't, Ben.  They're valuable.\"    \"Vallerble?  I should think they are, sir.  And, do you know, I will;  for who knows what might happen?  They tell me down in the village that  there's trouble uppards, and people gets talking agen the king.  Ah!  I'd talk 'em if I had my way, and make some of 'em squirm.--Yes, I will  tidy things up a bit.  Startle some on 'em if we was to fire off a gun  or two over the village.\"    \"They'd burst, Ben.  Haven't been fired for a hundred years, I should  say.  Those brass guns were made in Queen Elizabeth's time.\"    \"Oh, they wouldn't burst, sir; I shouldn't be afraid of that.--But this  is not learning to thrust, is it?\"    \"No.  Come on,\" cried Roy, and he took one of the stout ash rods.  \"Here, hadn't I better put on this helmet?\"    \"Not yet, sir.  You can practise thrusting without that.  Now then, here  I am, sir.  All ready for you on my guard.  Now, thrust.\"    Ben dropped into an easy position, with his legs a little bent, one foot  advanced, his left hand behind him, and his stick held diagonally across  his breast.    Roy imitated him, dropping into the same position.    \"Where shall I stab you?\" he cried.    \"Just wherever you like, sir,--if you can.\"    The boy made a quick dart forward with his stick, and it passed by his  teacher, who parried with the slightest movement of his wrist.    \"I said thrust, sir.\"    \"Well, I did thrust.\"    \"That wasn't a thrust, sir; that was only a poke.  It wouldn't have gone  through a man's coat, let alone his skin.  Now, again!\"    The boy made another push forward with his stick, which was also  parried.    \"Nay, that won't do, my lad; so let's get to something better.  Now, I'm  going to thrust at you right in the chest.  Enemies don't tell you where  they're going to hit you, but I'm going to tell you.  Now, look out!\"    Roy prepared to guard the thrust, but the point of the old man's stick  struck him sharply in the chest, and he winced a little, but smiled.    \"Now, sir, you do that, but harder.\"    Roy obeyed, but failed dismally.    \"Of course,\" said Ben.  \"Now that's because you didn't try the right  way, sir.  Don't poke at a man, but throw your arm right back till you  get your hand level with your shoulder, and sword and arm just in a  line.  Then thrust right out, and let your body follow your arm,--then  you get some strength into it.  Now, once more.\"    Roy followed his teacher's instructions.    \"Better--ever so much, sir.  Now again--good; again--good.  You'll soon  do it.  Now, can't you see what a lot of weight you get into a thrust  like that?  One of your pokes would have done nothing.  One like that  last would have sent your blade through a man.  Now again.\"    Roy was now fully upon his mettle, and he tried hard to acquire some  portion of the old soldier's skill, till his arm ached, and Ben cried  \"Halt!\" and began to chat about the old-fashioned armour.    \"Lots of it was too clumsy, sir.  Strong men were regularly loaded down;  and I've thought for a long time that all a man wants is a steel cap and  steel gloves.  All the rest he ought to be able to do with his sword.\"    \"But you can't ward off bullets with a sword, Ben,\" said Roy.    \"No, sir; nor you can't ward 'em off with armour.  They find out the  jyntes, if they don't go through.\"    \"Would that suit of half-armour be much too big for me, Ben?\" said Roy,  pausing before a bronzed ornamental set of defensive weapons, which had  evidently been the work of some Italian artist.    \"No, sir, I shouldn't think it would.  You see that was made for a small  man, and you're a big lad.  If you were to put that on, and used a bit  o' stuffing here and there, you wouldn't be so much amiss.  It's in fine  condition, too, with its leather lining, and that's all as lissome and  good as when it was first made.\"    \"I should like to try that on some day, Ben,\" said the boy, eagerly  examining the handsome suit.    \"Well, I don't see why not, sir.  You'd look fine in that.  Wants three  or four white ostrich feathers in the little gilt holder of the helmet.  White uns would look well with that dark armour.  Looks just like  copper, don't it?\"    \"How long would it take to put it on?\" said Roy.    \"Hour, sir; and you'd want some high buff boots to wear with it.\"    \"An hour?\" said Roy.  \"There wouldn't be time before breakfast.\"    \"No, sir.  But I tell you what--I've only cleaned and polished and iled  the straps.  If you feels as if you'd like to put it on, I'll go over it  well, and see to the buckles and studs: shall I?\"    \"Yes, do, Ben.\"    \"That I will, sir.  And I say, if, when you're ready, I was to saddle  one of the horses proper, and you was to mount and her ladyship see you,  she'd be sorry as ever she wanted you to be a statesman.\"    Roy shook his head dubiously.
