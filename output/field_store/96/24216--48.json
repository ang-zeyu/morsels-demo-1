Harris and I had a bit of a row over it, but at last split the  difference, and said half-past six.    \"Wake us at 6.30, George,\" we said.    George made no answer, and we found, on going over, that he had been  asleep for some time; so we placed the bath where he could tumble into it  on getting out in the morning, and went to bed ourselves.                        [Picture: Luggage with dog on top]          CHAPTER V.      Mrs. P. arouses us.--George, the sluggard.--The \"weather forecast\"  swindle.--Our luggage.--Depravity of the small boy.--The people gather  round us.--We drive off in great style, and arrive at  Waterloo.--Innocence of South Western Officials concerning such worldly  things as trains.--We are afloat, afloat in an open boat.    [Picture: Mrs. Poppets] It was Mrs. Poppets that woke me up next morning.    She said:    \"Do you know that it's nearly nine o'clock, sir?\"    \"Nine o' what?\" I cried, starting up.    \"Nine o'clock,\" she replied, through the keyhole.  \"I thought you was  a-oversleeping yourselves.\"    I woke Harris, and told him.  He said:    \"I thought you wanted to get up at six?\"    \"So I did,\" I answered; \"why didn't you wake me?\"    \"How could I wake you, when you didn't wake me?\" he retorted.  \"Now we  shan't get on the water till after twelve.  I wonder you take the trouble  to get up at all.\"    \"Um,\" I replied, \"lucky for you that I do.  If I hadn't woke you, you'd  have lain there for the whole fortnight.\"    [Picture: George snoring] We snarled at one another in this strain for  the next few minutes, when we were interrupted by a defiant snore from  George.  It reminded us, for the first time since our being called, of  his existence.  There he lay--the man who had wanted to know what time he  should wake us--on his back, with his mouth wide open, and his knees  stuck up.    I don't know why it should be, I am sure; but the sight of another man  asleep in bed when I am up, maddens me.  It seems to me so shocking to  see the precious hours of a man's life--the priceless moments that will  never come back to him again--being wasted in mere brutish sleep.    There was George, throwing away in hideous sloth the inestimable gift of  time; his valuable life, every second of which he would have to account  for hereafter, passing away from him, unused.  He might have been up  stuffing himself with eggs and bacon, irritating the dog, or flirting  with the slavey, instead of sprawling there, sunk in soul-clogging  oblivion.    It was a terrible thought.  Harris and I appeared to be struck by it at  the same instant.  We determined to save him, and, in this noble resolve,  our own dispute was forgotten.  We flew across and slung the clothes off  him, and Harris landed him one with a slipper, and I shouted in his ear,  and he awoke.    \"Wasermarrer?\" he observed, sitting up.    \"Get up, you fat-headed chunk!\" roared Harris.  \"It's quarter to ten.\"    \"What!\" he shrieked, jumping out of bed into the bath; \"Who the thunder  put this thing here?\"    We told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath.    We finished dressing, and, when it came to the extras, we remembered that  we had packed the tooth-brushes and the brush and comb (that tooth-brush  of mine will be the death of me, I know), and we had to go downstairs,  and fish them out of the bag.  And when we had done that George wanted  the shaving tackle.  We told him that he would have to go without shaving  that morning, as we weren't going to unpack that bag again for him, nor  for anyone like him.    He said:    \"Don't be absurd.  How can I go into the City like this?\"    It was certainly rather rough on the City, but what cared we for human  suffering?  As Harris said, in his common, vulgar way, the City would  have to lump it.    [Picture: Two dogs and umbrella] We went downstairs to breakfast.  Montmorency had invited two other dogs to come and see him off, and they  were whiling away the time by fighting on the doorstep.  We calmed them  with an umbrella, and sat down to chops and cold beef.    Harris said:    \"The great thing is to make a good breakfast,\" and he started with a  couple of chops, saying that he would take these while they were hot, as  the beef could wait.    George got hold of the paper, and read us out the boating fatalities, and  the weather forecast, which latter prophesied \"rain, cold, wet to fine\"  (whatever more than usually ghastly thing in weather that may be),  \"occasional local thunder-storms, east wind, with general depression over  the Midland Counties (London and Channel).  Bar. falling.\"    I do think that, of all the silly, irritating tomfoolishness by which we  are plagued, this \"weather-forecast\" fraud is about the most aggravating.  It \"forecasts\" precisely what happened yesterday or the day before, and  precisely the opposite of what is going to happen to-day.    I remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one late autumn by  our paying attention to the weather report of the local newspaper.  \"Heavy showers, with thunderstorms, may be expected to-day,\" it would say  on Monday, and so we would give up our picnic, and stop indoors all day,  waiting for the rain.--And people would pass the house, going off in  wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be, the sun shining  out, and not a cloud to be seen.    \"Ah!\" we said, as we stood looking out at them through the window, \"won't  they come home soaked!\"    And we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get, and came back  and stirred the fire, and got our books, and arranged our specimens of  seaweed and cockle shells.  By twelve o'clock, with the sun pouring into  the room, the heat became quite oppressive, and we wondered when those  heavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin.    \"Ah! they'll come in the afternoon, you'll find,\" we said to each other.  \"Oh, _won't_ those people get wet.  What a lark!\"    At one o'clock, the landlady would come in to ask if we weren't going  out, as it seemed such a lovely day.    \"No, no,\" we replied, with a knowing chuckle, \"not we.  _We_ don't mean  to get wet--no, no.\"    And when the afternoon was nearly gone, and still there was no sign of  rain, we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come  down all at once, just as the people had started for home, and were out  of the reach of any shelter, and that they would thus get more drenched  than ever.  But not a drop ever fell, and it finished a grand day, and a  lovely night after it.    The next morning we would read that it was going to be a \"warm, fine to  set-fair day; much heat;\" and we would dress ourselves in flimsy things,  and go out, and, half-an-hour after we had started, it would commence to  rain hard, and a bitterly cold wind would spring up, and both would keep  on steadily for the whole day, and we would come home with colds and  rheumatism all over us, and go to bed.    The weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether.  I never can  understand it.  The barometer is useless: it is as misleading as the  newspaper forecast.    There was one hanging up in a hotel at Oxford at which I was staying last  spring, and, when I got there, it was pointing to \"set fair.\"  It was  simply pouring with rain outside, and had been all day; and I couldn't  quite make matters out.  I tapped the barometer, and it jumped up and  pointed to \"very dry.\"  The Boots stopped as he was passing, and said he  expected it meant to-morrow.  I fancied that maybe it was thinking of the  week before last, but Boots said, No, he thought not.    I tapped it again the next morning, and it went up still higher, and the  rain came down faster than ever.  On Wednesday I went and hit it again,  and the pointer went round towards \"set fair,\" \"very dry,\" and \"much  heat,\" until it was stopped by the peg, and couldn't go any further.  It  tried its best, but the instrument was built so that it couldn't prophesy  fine weather any harder than it did without breaking itself.  It  evidently wanted to go on, and prognosticate drought, and water famine,  and sunstroke, and simooms, and such things, but the peg prevented it,  and it had to be content with pointing to the mere commonplace \"very  dry.\"    Meanwhile, the rain came down in a steady torrent, and the lower part of  the town was under water, owing to the river having overflowed.    Boots said it was evident that we were going to have a prolonged spell of  grand weather _some time_, and read out a poem which was printed over the  top of the oracle, about        \"Long foretold, long last;      Short notice, soon past.\"    The fine weather never came that summer.  I expect that machine must have  been referring to the following spring.    Then there are those new style of barometers, the long straight ones.  I  never can make head or tail of those.  There is one side for 10 a.m.  yesterday, and one side for 10 a.m. to-day; but you can't always get  there as early as ten, you know.  It rises or falls for rain and fine,  with much or less wind, and one end is \"Nly\" and the other \"Ely\" (what's  Ely got to do with it?), and if you tap it, it doesn't tell you anything.  And you've got to correct it to sea-level, and reduce it to Fahrenheit,  and even then I don't know the answer.    But who wants to be foretold the weather?  It is bad enough when it  comes, without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand.  The  prophet we like is the old man who, on the particularly gloomy-looking  morning of some day when we particularly want it to be fine, looks round  the horizon with a particularly knowing eye, and says:    \"Oh no, sir, I think it will clear up all right.  It will break all right  enough, sir.\"    \"Ah, he knows\", we say, as we wish him good-morning, and start off;  \"wonderful how these old fellows can tell!\"    And we feel an affection for that man which is not at all lessened by the  circumstances of its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#8)"],[1,"law; after which he be bound to reside two months in every  year; or, in case of non-residence, do forfeit the stipend of that  year to Mr Viner's general fund.    8. THAT the scholarships do become void in case of non-attendance on  the professor, or not taking the degree of bachelor of civil law,  being duly admonished so to do by the vice-chancellor and proctors:  and that both fellowships and scholarships do expire at the end of ten  years after each respective election; and become void in case of gross  misbehaviour, non-residence for two years together, marriage, not  being called to the bar within the time before limited, (being duly  admonished so to be by the vice-chancellor and proctors) or deserting  the profession of the law by following any other profession: and that  in any of these cases the vice-chancellor, with consent of  convocation, do declare the place actually void.    9. THAT in case of any vacancy of the professorship, fellowships, or  scholarships, the profits of the current year be ratably divided  between the predecessor or his representatives, and the successor; and  that a new election be had within one month afterwards, unless by that  means the time of election shall fall within any vacation, in which  case it be deferred to the first week in the next full term. And that  before any convocation shall be held for such election, or for any  other matter relating to Mr Viner's benefaction, ten days public  notice be given to each college and hall of the convocation, and the  cause of convoking it.]    THE advantages that might result to the science of the law itself,  when a little more attended to in these seats of knowlege, perhaps  would be very considerable. The leisure and abilities of the learned  in these retirements might either suggest expedients, or execute those  dictated by wiser heads[k], for improving it's method, retrenching  it's superfluities, and reconciling the little contrarieties, which  the practice of many centuries will necessarily create in any human  system: a task, which those who are deeply employed in business, and  the more active scenes of the profession, can hardly condescend to  engage in. And as to the interest, or (which is the same) the  reputation of the universities themselves, I may venture to pronounce,  that if ever this study should arrive to any tolerable perfection  either here or at Cambridge, the nobility and gentry of this kingdom  would not shorten their residence upon this account, nor perhaps  entertain a worse opinion of the benefits of academical education.  Neither should it be considered as a matter of light importance, that  while we thus extend the _pomoeria_ of university learning, and adopt  a new tribe of citizens within these philosophical walls, we interest  a very numerous and very powerful profession in the preservation of  our rights and revenues.    [Footnote k: See lord Bacon's proposals and offer of a digest.]    FOR I think it is past dispute that those gentlemen, who resort to the  inns of court with a view to pursue the profession, will find it  expedient (whenever it is practicable) to lay the previous foundations  of this, as well as every other science, in one of our learned  universities. We may appeal to the experience of every sensible  lawyer, whether any thing can be more hazardous or discouraging than  the usual entrance on the study of the law. A raw and unexperienced  youth, in the most dangerous season of life, is transpanted  [Transcriber's Note: transplanted] on a sudden into the midst of  allurements to pleasure, without any restraint or check but what his  own prudence can suggest; with no public direction in what course to  pursue his enquiries; no private assistance to remove the distresses  and difficulties, which will always embarass a beginner. In this  situation he is expected to sequester himself from the world, and by a  tedious lonely process to extract the theory of law from a mass of  undigested learning; or else by an assiduous attendance on the courts  to pick up theory and practice together, sufficient to qualify him for  the ordinary run of business. How little therefore is it to be  wondered at, that we hear of so frequent miscarriages; that so many  gentlemen of bright imaginations grow weary of so unpromising a  search[l], and addict themselves wholly to amusements, or other less  innocent pursuits; and that so many persons of moderate capacity  confuse themselves at first setting out, and continue ever dark and  puzzled during the remainder of their lives!    [Footnote l: Sir Henry Spelman, in the preface to his glossary, gives  us a very lively picture of his own distress upon this occasion.  \"_Emisit me mater Londinum, juris nostri capessendi gratia; cujus cum  vestibulum salutassem, reperissemque linguam peregrinam, dialectum  barbaram, methodum inconcinnam, molem non ingentem solum sed perpetuis  humeris sustinendam, excidit mihi (fateor) animus, &c._\"]    THE evident want of some assistance in the rudiments of legal  knowlege, has given birth to a practice, which, if ever it had grown  to be general, must have proved of extremely pernicious consequence:  I mean the custom, by some so very warmly recommended, to drop all  liberal education, as of no use to lawyers; and to place them, in it's  stead, as [Transcriber's Note: at] the desk of some skilful attorney;  in order to initiate them early in all the depths of practice, and  render them more dextrous in the mechanical part of business. A few  instances of particular persons, (men of excellent learning, and  unblemished integrity) who, in spight of this method of education,  have shone in the foremost ranks of the bar, have afforded some kind  of sanction to this illiberal path to the profession, and biassed many  parents, of shortsighted judgment, in it's favour: not considering,  that there are some geniuses, formed to overcome all disadvantages,  and that from such particular instances no general rules can be  formed; nor observing, that those very persons have frequently  recommended by the most forcible of all examples, the disposal of  their own offspring, a very different foundation of legal studies, a  regular academical education. Perhaps too, in return, I could now  direct their eyes to our principal seats of justice, and suggest a few  hints, in favour of university learning[m]:--but in these all who hear  me, I know, have already prevented me.    [Footnote m: The four highest offices in the law were at that time  filled by gentlemen, two of whom had been fellows of All Souls  college; another, student of Christ-Church; and the fourth a fellow of  Trinity college, Cambridge.]    MAKING therefore due allowance for one or two shining exceptions,  experience may teach us to foretell that a lawyer thus educated to the  bar, in subservience to attorneys and solicitors[n], will find he has  begun at the wrong end. If practice be the whole he is taught,  practice must also be the whole he will ever know: if he be  uninstructed in the elements and first principles upon which the rule  of practice is founded, the least variation from established  precedents will totally distract and bewilder him: _ita lex scripta  est_[o] is the utmost his knowlege will arrive at; he must never  aspire to form, and seldom expect to comprehend, any arguments drawn  _a priori_, from the spirit of the laws and the natural foundations of  justice.    [Footnote n: See Kennet's life of Somner. p. 67.]    [Footnote o: _Ff._ 40. 9. 12.]    NOR is this all; for (as few persons of birth, or fortune, or even of  scholastic education, will submit to the drudgery of servitude and the  manual labour of copying the trash of an office) should this  infatuation prevail to any considerable degree, we must rarely expect  to see a gentleman of distinction or learning at the bar. And what the  consequence may be, to have the interpretation and enforcement of the  laws (which include the entire disposal of our properties, liberties,  and lives) fall wholly into the hands of obscure or illiterate men, is  matter of very public concern.    THE inconveniences here pointed out can never be effectually  prevented, but by making academical education a previous step to the  profession of the common law, and at the same time making the  rudiments of the law a part of academical education. For sciences are  of a sociable disposition, and flourish best in the neighbourhood of  each other: nor is there any branch of learning, but may be helped and  improved by assistances drawn from other arts. If therefore the  student in our laws hath formed both his sentiments and style, by  perusal and imitation of the purest classical writers, among whom the  historians and orators will best deserve his regard; if he can reason  with precision, and separate argument from fallacy, by the clear  simple rules of pure unsophisticated logic; if he can fix his  attention, and steadily pursue truth through any the most intricate  deduction, by the use of mathematical demonstrations; if he has  enlarged his conceptions of nature and art, by a view of the several  branches of genuine, experimental, philosophy; if he has impressed on  his mind the sound maxims of the law of nature, the best and most  authentic foundation of human laws; if, lastly, he has contemplated  those maxims reduced to a practical system in the laws of imperial  Rome; if he has done this or any part of it, (though all may be easily  done under as able instructors as ever graced any seats of learning) a  student thus qualified may enter upon the study of the law with  incredible advantage and reputation. And if, at the conclusion, or  during the acquisition of these accomplishments, he will afford  himself here a year or two's farther leisure, to lay the foundation of  his future labours in a solid scientifical method, without thirsting  too early to attend that practice which it is impossible he should  rightly"]]]
