Despite its    abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's    lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for    80%-90% of the population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil    production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy,    contributing about 50% to GDP. Despite the signing of a peace accord    in November 1994 between the Angola Government and the UNITA    insurgents, sporadic fighting continues and many farmers remain    reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the    country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich    resources - notably gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic    fisheries, and arable land, in addition to its large oil deposits -    Angola will need to observe the cease-fire, implement the peace    agreement, and reform government policies.

During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed  coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as  Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In  the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch  amphibious operations against many islands about which information was  unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the  United States should never again be caught unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval  Intelligence--ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the Office  of Strategic Services--OSS) decided that a joint effort should be  initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that  recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing  Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy  Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental  basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government  for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic  intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34  JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous  letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.  Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,  \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based  planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world  was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on  national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than war.  \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities--not  just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and  officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October  1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime  replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country  sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more  comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced  the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955  that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication  which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all  areas of the world. . . . There will always be a continuing requirement  for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was created as an  annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first  classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first  unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was  terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer  components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the  public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The  1996 edition was printed by GPO and the 1997 edition was reprinted by  GPO. The year 1999 marks the 52nd anniversary of the establishment of  the Central Intelligence Agency and the 56th year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its  two predecessor programs        =====================================================================        Purchasing Information      The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) prepares The World Factbook in  printed, CD-ROM, and Internet versions.
