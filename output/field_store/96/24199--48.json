May I?\"    \"Some day, when we get more expert in managing it,\" he replied, as he  shook hands with her.    \"Now for some hard work,\" went on the young inventor to Mr. Sharp, when  the roof was cleared of the last of the teachers and pupils. But the  windows that gave a view of the airship in its odd position on the roof  were soon filled with eager faces, while in the streets below was a  great crowd, offering all manner of suggestions.    \"Oh, it's not going to be such a task,\" said Mr. Sharp. \"First we will  repair the rudder and the machinery, and then we'll generate some more  gas, rise and fly home.\"    \"But the broken propeller?\" objected Tom.    \"We can fly with one, as well as we can with two, but not so swiftly.  Don't worry. We'll come out all right,\" and the balloonist assumed a  confident air.    It was not so difficult a problem as Tom had imagined to put the  machinery in order, a simple break having impaired the working of the  rudder. Then the smashed propeller was unshipped and the gas machine  started. With all the pupils watching from windows, and a crowd  observing from the streets and surrounding country, for word of the  happening had spread, Tom and his friend prepared to ascend.    They arose as well as they had done at the shed at home, and in a  little while, were floating over the school. Tom fancied he could  observe a certain hand waving to him, as he peered from the window of  the car--a hand in one of the school casements, but where there were so  many pretty girls doing the same thing, I hardly see how Tom could pick  out any certain one, though he had extraordinarily good eyesight.  However, the airship was now afloat and, starting the motor, Mr. Sharp  found that even with one propeller the Red Cloud did fairly well,  making good speed.    \"Now for home, to repair everything, and we'll be ready for a longer  trip,\" the aeronaut said to the young inventor, as they turned around,  and headed off before the wind, while hundreds below them cheered.    \"We ought to carry spare propellers if we're going to smash into school  towers,\" remarked Tom. \"I seem to be a sort of hoodoo.\"    \"Nonsense! It wasn't your fault at all,\" commented Mr. Sharp warmly.  \"It would have happened to me had I been steering. But we will take an  extra propeller along after this.\"    An hour later they arrived in front of the big shed and the Red Cloud  was safely housed. Mr. Swift was just beginning to get anxious about  his son and his friend, and was glad to welcome them back.    \"Now for a big trip, in about a week!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp  enthusiastically. \"You'll come with us, won't you, Mr. Swift?\"    The inventor slowly shook his head.    \"Not on a trip,\" he said. \"I may go for a trial spin with you, but I've  got too important a matter under way to venture on a long trip,\" and he  turned away without explaining what it was. But Tom and Mr. Sharp were  soon to learn.          Chapter 7    Andy Tries a Trick      Without loss of time the young inventor and the aeronaut began to  repair the damage done to the Red Cloud by colliding with the tower.  The most important part to reconstruct was the propeller, and Mr. Sharp  decided to make two, instead of one, in order to have an extra one in  case of future accidents.    Tom's task was to arrange the mechanism so that, hereafter, the rudder  could not become jammed, and so prevent the airship from steering  properly. This the lad accomplished by a simple but effective device  which, when the balloonist saw it, caused him to compliment Tom.    \"That's worth patenting,\" he declared. \"I advise you to take out papers  on that.\"    \"It seems such a simple thing,\" answered the youth. \"And I don't see  much use of spending the money for a patent. Airships aren't likely to  be so numerous that I could make anything off that patent.\"    \"You take my advice,\" insisted Mr. Sharp. \"Airships are going to be  used more in the future than you have any idea of. You get that device  patented.\"    Tom did so, and, not many years afterward he was glad that he had, as  it brought him quite an income.    It required several days' work on the Red Cloud before it was in shape  for another trial. During the hours when he was engaged in the big  shed, helping Mr. Sharp, the young inventor spent many minutes calling  to mind the memory of a certain fair face, and I think I need not  mention any names to indicate whose face it was.    \"She promised to go for a ride with me,\" mused the lad. \"I hope she  doesn't back out. But I'll want to learn more about managing the ship  before I venture with her in it. It won't do to have any accidents  then. There's Ned Newton, too. I must take him for a skim in the  clouds. Guess I'll invite him over some afternoon, and give him a  private view of the machine, when we get it in shape again.\"    About a week after the accident at the school Mr. Sharp remarked to Tom  one afternoon:    \"If the weather is good to-morrow, we'll try another flight. Do you  suppose your father will come along?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the lad. \"He seems much engrossed in  something. It's unusual, too, for he most generally tells me what he is  engaged upon. However, I guess he will say something about it when he  gets ready.\"    \"Well, if he doesn't feel just like coming, don't argue him. He might  be nervous, and, while the ship is new, I don't want any nervous  passengers aboard. I can't give them my attention and look after the  running of the machinery.\"    \"I was going to propose bringing a friend of mine over to see us make  the trip to-morrow,\" went on the young inventor. \"Ned Newton, you know  him. He'd like a ride.\"    \"Oh, I guess Ned's all right. Let him come along. We won't go very high  to-morrow. After a trial rise by means of the gas, I'm going to lower  the ship to the ground, and try for an elevation by means of the  planes. Oh, yes, bring your friend along.\"    Ned Newton was delighted the next day to receive Tom's invitation, and,  though a little dubious about trusting himself in an airship for the  first time, finally consented to go with his chum. He got a half  holiday from the bank, and, shortly after dinner went to Tom's house.    \"Come on out in the shed and take a look at the Red Cloud,\" proposed  the young inventor. \"Mr. Sharp isn't quite ready to start yet, and I'll  explain some things to you.\"    The big shed was deserted when the lads entered, and went to the loft  where they were on a level with the big, red aluminum tank. Tom began  with a description of the machinery, and Ned followed him with interest.    \"Now we'll go down into the car or cabin,\" continued the young  navigator of the air, \"and I'll show you what we do when we're touring  amid the clouds.\"    As they started to descend the flight of steps from the loft platform,  a noise on the ground below attracted their attention.    \"Guess that's Mr. Sharp coming,\" said Ned.    Tom leaned over and looked down. An instant later he grasped the arm of  his chum, and motioned to him to keep silent.    \"Take a look,\" whispered the young inventor.    \"Andy Foger!\" exclaimed Ned, peering over the railing.    \"Yes, and Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey are with him. They sneaked in  when I left the door open. Wonder what they want?\"    \"Up to some mischief, I'll wager,\" commented Ned. \"Hark! They're  talking.\"    The two lads on the loft listened intently. Though the cronies on the  ground below them did not speak loudly, their voices came plainly to  the listeners.    \"Let's poke a hole in their gas bag,\" proposed Sam. \"That will make  them think they're not so smart as they pretend.\"    \"Naw, we can't do that,\" answered Andy.    \"Why not?\" declared Pete.    \"Because the bag's away up in the top part of the shed, and I'm not  going to climb up there.\"    \"You're afraid,\" sneered Sam.    \"I am not! I'll punch your face if you say that again! Besides the  thing that holds the gas is made of aluminum, and we can't make a hole  in it unless we take an axe, and that makes too much noise.\"    \"We ought to play some sort of a trick on Tom Swift,\" proposed Pete.  \"He's too fresh!\"    Tom shook his fist at the lads on the ground, but of course they did  not see him.    \"I have it!\" came from Andy.    \"What?\" demanded his two cronies.    \"We'll cut some of the guy wires from the planes and rudders. That will  make the airship collapse. They'll think the wires broke from the  strain. Take out your knives and saw away at the wires. Hurry, too, or  they may catch us.\"    \"You're caught now,\" whispered Ned to Tom. \"Come on down, and give 'em  a trouncing.\"    Tom hesitated. He looked quickly about the loft, and then a smile  replaced the frown of righteous anger on his face.    \"I have a better way,\" he said.    \"What is it?\"    \"See that pile of dirt?\" and he pointed to some refuse that had been  swept up from the floor of the loft. Ned nodded. \"It consists of a lot  of shavings, sawdust and, what's more, a lot of soot and lampblack that  we used in mixing some paint. We'll sweep the whole pile down on their  heads, and make them wish they'd stayed away from this place.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Ned, chuckling. \"Give me a broom. There's another one  for you.\"    The two lads in the loft peered down. The red-headed, squint-eyed bully  and his chums had their knives out, and were about to cut some of the  important guy wires, when, at a signal from Tom, Ned, with a sweep of  his broom, sent a big pile of the dirt, sawdust and lampblack down upon  the heads of the conspirators. The young inventor did the same thing,  and for an instant the lower part of the shed looked as if a dirtstorm  had taken place there. The pile of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30066"],[0,"Laboratory Manual of Glass-Blowing (#8)"],[1,"tubing previously prepared is sealed  on at that point. The joint is then well annealed and allowed to cool.    The tube _a_ is now cut at such a place that when _b_ is inserted in the  open end the point will come near the end of the constriction of _a_, as  shown in _c_. Care is taken to get a clean square cut. The side tube is  now cut off about an inch from the main tube and corked. Tube _b_ is  sealed into the open end of _a_, in the same way as _a_ was sealed into  the large tube, and the joint carefully annealed.    =Discussion.=--As in the first method, the secret of success lies in  getting a square joint, and having the inner tube leave the outer one at  nearly right angles. All the remarks about annealing, lumps, etc., made  under the previous method apply here.    This method may be applied in sealing a small tube into the end of a  large one, the latter being either drawn to a cone and cut off at the  desired diameter, or else given a rounded end like a test-tube and a  hole the proper size blown in the center of it. A suitable thick-walled  bulb is to be blown on the small tube, as in the case described above.  This method is also used in making the Kjeldahl trap (_a_, Fig. 13), the  small tube to be inserted being first drawn, the thick bulb blown at its  point of union with the main tube, and then the small tube bent and cut.  The large bulb is best made with rather heavy wall, being either blown  in the middle of a tube, and one piece of the tube drawn or cut off, or  else made on the end of a tube. In the latter case a drop of glass must  be put on the point where the joint is to be, so as to get a hole of the  proper size with enough glass around it to prevent it from growing  larger when it is heated. The author prefers to blow the bulb in the  middle of the tube, draw off one end of the bulb, and blow out the  desired hole where the tube was drawn off. The whole bulb must generally  be reheated and blown a little at the end of the process, and well  annealed.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--_a_, Kjeldahl trap; _b_, suction pump on  smaller tubing.]    The suction pump can also be made on 1/4-inch tubing, and one joint  saved if desired, by constricting the tube to form the raceway for the  water and air, as shown in _b_, Fig. 13. (See page 10 for method.) But  it is more difficult to make a square joint on such small tubing.          CHAPTER V    MODIFIED METHODS AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS      CAPILLARY TUBING    This is commonly used in many forms of apparatus for gas analysis, and  one is often called upon to join two pieces or to make a tee on it. The  methods are nearly the same as with other tubing, except that more care  and patience are required. The work must be done much more slowly on  account of the thickness of the walls, and open ends of the tube must  always be enlarged before joining them to anything. This is best done by  carefully sealing the end and then blowing, with several suitable  reheatings, to form a pear-shaped bulb as in _a_, Fig. 14. The end of  this is then heated and blown off, and the piece is ready to be joined  to another similar end, or to a piece of ordinary tubing if desired. The  joints are best not blown too much, as thick walls shrink very slowly.  Much may be done by gently pushing the tube together or pulling it apart  in the flame, to remove lumps and irregularities. It is necessary that  the bore of the joint be approximately that of the main tube, and care  must be taken that the latter is not constricted at the point where the  joint begins.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Capillary tubing.]    Especial care must be taken to warm the tube slowly when starting and  cool it slowly when through, as the thick walls frequently crack if not  carefully handled. For this reason the whole neighborhood of the joint  must be heated somewhat so that there may not be stresses set up between  the heated and unheated portions.    In making the tee (_b_, Fig. 14) the inability to blow the joint makes  itself decidedly felt, but if the side tube is properly enlarged as  previously described, a good joint can be made by alternately pulling  and pushing on the end of the side tube, and shrinking well.    Very fine capillary tubing should be blown with a rubber bulb instead of  the mouth, so as not to get moisture into the tube. The rubber bulb may  also be used to advantage on some of the coarser capillary tubing.    When a bulb is to be joined to a piece of capillary tubing, the joint is  preferably made before blowing the bulb, and will then be taken up a  little way on the bulb during the process. Care must of course be taken  not to constrict the capillary; the pear-shaped bulb blown on the end  (_a_, Fig. 14) may well extend back a little further than usual into the  tube so as to prevent this. If a bulb is required in the middle of a  capillary tube, the latter is usually best cut and a piece of ordinary  tubing of suitable size sealed in to provide material for the bulb.      GLASS ROD    Joints, tees, etc., in glass rod are made on the same principle as in  tubing, except that of course they cannot be blown, and regularity must  be obtained by accumulating a small mass of uniformly heated glass, and  then drawing it to a suitable rod, on the same principle as Exercise No.  1.    Great care must be taken in heating and cooling this, as in the case of  the capillary tubing, and for the same reasons.    By joining pieces side by side, pressing with carbon plates or a plate  and a rod, and other suitable manipulations, stirrers, spatulas, and  other objects may easily be made from rod, and its manipulation is  relatively easy on account of the fact that one does not have to worry  about the bore of the tube. But the same general rule about not having  thick and thin spots in contact, and making all changes in diameter on a  taper if possible instead of abruptly, applies here. Thick pieces will  cool and contract at different rates from thin ones, and cracks are  likely to develop where they join. Work which has been formed with any  tool must always be heated to the softening point afterward before  allowing it to cool in order to remove the stresses caused by the  contact of the tool with the hot glass.    When it is necessary to join a piece of rod to the side of a piece of  tubing, the end of the rod is made very hot while the wall of the tube  at the spot desired is heated to just below the softening temperature.  The rod can then be pressed into firm union with the tube and drawn a  little to remove the excess of glass without deforming the tube.      MENDING STOPCOCKS    =Mending the Plug.=--The plug of the stopcock occasionally falls out and  is broken. If the break is in the main part of the plug, nothing can be  done except to search for a spare plug of suitable size and grind it to  fit, as described below. If only the little cross-piece at the end is  broken off, it can easily be replaced. In most ordinary stopcocks the  plug is solid, but the little handle is hollow. What has been said above  regarding care in heating and cooling glass rod applies with especial  force here. It is usually best to wind the whole of the plug with  several thicknesses of asbestos cord, leaving bare only the end where  the handle is to be joined. This diminishes the danger of cracking the  plug by too rapid heating, and also makes it more comfortable to hold. A  piece of rather thick-walled tubing of suitable diameter is chosen,  drawn out so as to have a suitable taper (taking care to heat enough of  the tube so that the capillary tail has good wall-thickness and  strength), and then a corresponding taper is drawn to form the other  side of the handle. The result is shown in Fig. 15, _a_. The capillary  tail is now heated and bent back to form a handle which will be in the  same straight line as the axis of the plug (_b_, Fig. 15) and the main  part of the tube drawn off at the dotted line, making a neat seal at  that point. The broken end of the plug is now slowly warmed in the smoky  flame, the heat gradually increased by a gentle stream of air from the  bellows, and the point at which this handle is to be attached finally  brought to the temperature at which the glass flows freely. In the mean  time, the little handle has been warmed almost to the softening point.  It is now quickly pushed into place (_c_, Fig. 15), taking care that its  axis is parallel to the hole in the plug, and then drawn away from the  plug just enough to make a graceful neck instead of the bulging one  indicated by the arrow in the figure. With a fine pointed flame the  little tail is now drawn off at the point indicated by the dotted line  (_c_, Fig. 15) and the whole carefully annealed. If necessary, the  handle can be blown a little before the tail is removed. Local heating  and blowing at the point where the handle joins the plug is often  necessary in order to make a smooth job.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Stopcock plug.]    =Regrinding.=--This is sometimes necessary to make stopcocks tight, when  the grinding has not been properly done in the factory. For this, a very  little fine flour of emery or carborundum is the best and quickest. If  this is not at hand, some clean sand may be ground in an agate mortar,  and if possible sieved. Only material which passes the 100-mesh sieve  should be used. It will be ground still finer in the process. For the  final polishing, a little infusorial earth or even kaolin will do.    The surface to be ground is moistened with water and dusted over with a  little of the abrasive. The plug is now inserted in the stopcock, and  turned with a gentle pressure. This turning should be in the same  direction for several revolutions, then in the opposite direction for  several more revolutions, etc. As the abrasive becomes finer during the  grinding, a little more may be added if necessary. In general, only a  little grinding will be required, and one small pinch"]]]
