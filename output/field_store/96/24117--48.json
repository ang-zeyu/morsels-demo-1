If  the tear crosses print, and there are no overlapping edges, either  tiny pieces of pared paper may be cut and laid across the tear between  the lines of print, or else a piece of the thinnest Japanese paper,  which is nearly transparent, may be pasted right along the tear over  the print; in either case the mend should be strengthened at the edge  of the page by an additional thickness of paper. In cases where the  backs of the sections have been much damaged, it will be necessary to  put a guard the entire length, or in the case of small holes, to fill  them in with pieces of torn paper. The edges of any mend may, with  great care, be scraped with a sharp knife having a slight burr on the  under side, and then rubbed lightly with a piece of worn fine  sand-paper, or a fragment of cuttle-fish bone. Care must be taken not  to pare away too much, and especially not to weaken the mend at the  edges of the sheet. As a general rule, the new mending paper should go  on the back of a sheet.    Sometimes it is thought necessary to fill up worm-holes in the paper.  This may be done by boiling down some paper in size until it is of a  pulpy consistency, and a little of this filled into the worm-holes  will re-make the paper in those places. It is a very tedious  operation, and seldom worth doing.    Mending vellum is done in much the same way as mending paper,  excepting that a little greater overlap must be left. It is well to  put a stitch of silk at each end of a vellum patch, as you cannot  depend on paste alone holding vellum securely. The overlapping edges  must be well roughed up with a knife to make sure that the paste will  stick. A cut in a vellum page is best mended with fine silk with a  lacing stitch (see fig. 18).        [Illustration: FIG. 18.]    Mending is most easily done on a sheet of plate-glass, of which the  edges and corners have been rubbed down.                                         CHAPTER V                     End Papers--Leather Joints--Pressing                                    END PAPERS    If an old book that has had much wear is examined, it will generally  be found that the leaves at the beginning and the end have suffered  more than the rest of the book. On this ground, and also to enable  people who must write notes in books to do so with the least injury to  the book, it is advisable to put a good number of blank papers at each  end. As these papers are part of the binding, and have an important  protective function to perform, they should be of good quality. At all  times difficulty has been found in preventing the first and last  section of the book, whether end papers or not, from dragging away  when the cover is opened, and various devices have been tried to  overcome this defect. In the fifteenth century strips of vellum  (usually cut from manuscripts) were pasted on to the back of the book  and on the inside of the boards, or in some cases were merely folded  round the first and last section and pasted on to the covers. The  modern, and far less efficient, practice is to \"overcast\" the first  and last sections. This is objectionable, because it prevents the  leaves from opening right to the back, and it fails in the object  aimed at, by merely transferring the strain to the back of the  overcast section.    In order to make provision for any strain there may be in opening the  cover, it is better to adopt some such arrangement as shown in fig.  19. In this end paper the zigzag opens slightly in response to any  strain.    The way to make this end paper is to take a folded sheet of paper a  little larger than the book. Then with dividers mark two points an  eighth of an inch from the back for the fold, and paste your  paste-down paper, B B, up to these points (see fig. 19, II). When the  paste is dry, fold back the sheet (A1) over the paste-down paper, and  A2 the reverse way, leaving the form seen in fig. 19, III. A folded  sheet of paper similar to A is inserted at C (fig. 19, V, H), and the  sewing passes through this. When the book is pasted down the leaf A1  is torn off, and B1 pasted down on the board. If marbled paper is  desired, the marble should be \"made,\" that is, pasted on to B1.        [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    There are considerable disadvantages in using marbled papers, as if  they are of thick enough paper to help the strength of the binding,  the \"made\" sheet is very stiff, and in a small book is troublesome. On  no account should any marble paper be used, unless it is tough and  durable. The quality of the paper of which most marbled papers are  made is so poor, that it is unsuitable for use as end papers. For most  books a self-coloured paper of good quality answers well for the  paste-down sheets.    It is a mistake to leave end papers to be pasted on after the book has  been forwarded, as in that case they have little constructive value.  Every leaf of such an end paper as is described above will open right  to the back, and the zigzag allows play for the drag of the board.    Paper with a conventional pattern painted or printed on it may be used  for end papers. If such a design is simple, such as a sprig repeated  all over, or an arrangement of stars or dots, it may look very well;  but over elaborate end papers, and especially those that aim at  pictorial effect, are seldom successful.    Ends may be made of thin vellum. If so, unless the board is very  heavy, it is best to have leather joints.    A single leaf of vellum (in the place of B1 and 2, II, fig. 19) should  have an edge turned up into the zigzag with the leather joint, and  sewn through. Vellum ends must always be sewn, as it is not safe to  rely upon paste to hold them. They look well, and may be enriched by  tooling. The disadvantage of vellum is, that it has a tendency to curl  up if subjected to heat, and when it contracts it unduly draws the  boards of the book. For large manuscripts, or printed books on vellum,  which are bound in wooden or other thick boards and are clasped,  thicker vellum may be used for the ends; that with a slightly brown  surface looks best. The part that will come into the joint should be  scraped thin with a knife, and a zigzag made of Japanese paper.    Silk or other fine woven material may be used for ends. It is best  used with a leather joint, and may be stuck on to the first paper of  the end papers (B1, No. 2, fig. 19), and cut with the book. The  glaire of the edge gilding will help to stop the edges fraying out. In  attaching silk to paper, thin glue is the best thing to use; the  paper, not the silk, being glued. Some little practice is needed to  get sufficient glue on the paper to make the silk stick all over, and  yet not to soil it. When the silk has been glued to the paper, it  should be left under a light weight to dry. If put in the press, the  glue may be squeezed through and the silk soiled.    If the silk is very thin, or delicate in colour, or if it seems likely  that it will fray out at the edges, it is better to turn the edges in  over a piece of paper cut a little smaller than the page of the book  and stick them down. This forms a pad, which may be attached to the  first leaf of the end papers; a similar pad may be made for filling in  the board.    Before using, the silk should be damped and ironed flat on the wrong  side.    Silk ends give a book a rich finish, but seldom look altogether  satisfactory. If the silk is merely stuck on to the first end paper,  the edges will generally fray out if the book is much used. If the  edges are turned in, an unpleasantly thick end is made.                                  LEATHER JOINTS    Leather joints are pieces of thin leather that are used to cover the  joints on the inside (for paring, see page 154). They add very little  strength to the book, but give a pleasant finish to the inside of the  board.    If there are to be leather joints, the end papers are made up without  A 1, and the edge of the leather pasted and inserted at D, with a  piece of common paper as a protection (see fig. 19, IV). When the  paste is dry, the leather is folded over at E.    A piece of blotting-paper may be pasted on to the inside of the waste  leaf, leaving enough of it loose to go between the leather joint and  the first sheet of the end paper. This will avoid any chance of the  leather joint staining or marking the ends while the book is being  bound. The blotting-paper, of course, is taken out with the waste  sheet before the joint is pasted down.    Joints may also be made of linen or cloth inserted in the same way. A  cloth joint has greater strength than a leather one, as the latter has  to be very thin in order that the board may shut properly.    With leather or cloth joints, the sewing should go through both E and  F.                                     PRESSING        [Illustration: FIG. 20.]        [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Standing Press]    While the end papers are being made, the sections of the book should  be pressed. To do this a pressing-board is taken which is a little  larger than the book, and a tin, covered with common paper, placed on  that, then a few sections of the book, then another tin covered with  paper, and then more sections, and so on, taking care that the  sections are exactly over one another (see fig. 20). A second  pressing-board having been placed on the last tin, the pile of  sections, tins, and pressing-boards can be put into the standing-press  and left under pressure till next day. Newly printed plates should be  protected by thin tissue paper while being pressed. Any folded plates  or maps, &c., or inserted letters, must either not be pressed, or have  tins placed on each side of them to prevent them from indenting the  adjoining leaves.        [Illustration: FIG. 22.--French Standing Press]    Hand-printed books, such as the publications of the Kelmscott Press,  should have very little pressure, or the \"impression\" of the print and  the surface of the paper may "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26679"],[0,"Wit and Mirth: or Pills to Purge Melancholy, Vol. 5 of 6 (#8)"],[1,"  Oh what will become of me,    My Belly's as big as two;  'Tis with a Two-legg'd Tympany,    _I cannot tell what to do_.    You Lasses that hear my Moan,    If you will your Joys renew;  Besure, while Married, lye alone,    _Or else you at length may rue_.    I came of as good a Race,    As most is in _Lynn_'s fair Town;  And cost a great deal bringing up,    _But a little Thing laid me down_.          _The Jovial Tinker._      [Music]    There was a Jovial Tinker,  Which was a good Ale drinker;  He never was a Shrinker,    Believe me this is true;  And he came from the wild of _Kent_,  When all his Money was gone and spent,  Which made him look like a _Jack-a-Lent_,    _And Joan's Ale is new,_    _And Joan's Ale is new Boys,_    _And Joan's Ale is new._    The Tinker he did settle,  Most like a Man of Mettle,  And vow'd to pawn his Kettle,    Now mark what did ensue;  His Neighbours they flock'd in apace,  To see _Tom Tinker's_ comely Face,  Where they drank soundly for a space,    _Whilst_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    The Cobler and the Broom Man,  Came next into the Room, Man,  And said they would drink for boon Man,    Let each one take his due;  But when good Liquor they had found,  They cast their Caps upon the Ground,  And so the Tinker he drank round,    _Whilst_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    The Rag-Man being weary,  With the Burden he did carry,  He swore he would be merry,    And spend a Shilling or two;  And he told his Hostess to her Face,  The Chimney-corner was his Place,  And he began to drink apace,    _And_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    The Pedlar he drew nigher,  For it was his desire,  To throw the Rags i'th' Fire,    And burn the bundle blue;  So whilst they drank whole Flashes,  And threw about the Glasses,  The Rags were burnt to Ashes,    _And_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.      _The Second_ PART.    And then came in a Hatter,  To see what was the matter,  He scorn'd to drink cold Water,    Amongst that Jovial Crew;  And like a Man of Courage stout,  He took the Quart-Pot by the Snout,  And never left till all was out,    _O_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    The Taylor being nimble,  With Bodkin, Shears and Thimble,  He did no whit dissemble,    I think his name was _True_;  He said that he was like to choak,  And he call'd so fast for Lap and Smoak,  Until he had pawn'd the Vinegar Cloak,    _For_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    Then came a pitiful Porter,  Which often did resort there,  Quoth he, I'll shew some Sport here,    Amongst the Jovial Crew;  The Porter he had very bad luck,  Before that it was ten a Clock,  The Fool got Drunk, and lost his Frock,    _For_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    The bonny brave Shoe-maker,  A brave Tobacco taker,  He scorn'd to be a Quaker,    I think his Name was _Hugh_;  He call'd for Liquor in so fast,  Till he forgot his Awl and Last,  And up the Reckoning he did cast,    _Whilst_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    And then came in the Weaver,  You never saw a braver,  With a Silk Man and a Glover,    _Tom Tinker_ for to view;  And so to welcom him to Town,  They every Man spent half a Crown,  And so the Drink went merrily down,    _For_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    Then came a Drunken _Dutchman_,  And he would have a touch, Man,  But he soon took too much, Man,    Which made them after rue;  He drank so long as I suppose,  'Till greasie Drops fell from his Nose,  And like a Beast befoul'd his Hose,    _Whilst_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    A _Welchman_ he came next, Sir,  With Joy and Sorrow Mixt, Sir,  Who being partly vex'd, Sir,    He out his Dagger drew;  Cuts-plutter-a-nails, quoth _Taffy_ then,  A _Welchman_ is a Shentleman,  Come Hostess fill's the other Cann,    _For_ Joan's _Ale_, &c.    Thus like to Men of Courage stout,  Couragiously they drank about,  Till such time all the Ale was out,    As I may tell to you;  And when the Business was done,  They every man departed home,  And promis'd _Joan_ again to come,    _When she had Brew'd anew_.          _The Soldiers Fortune: Or, the taking_ Mardyke.

Let bold _Bellona's_ Brewer frown,  And his Tunn shall overflow the Town;  And give the Cobler Sword and Fate:  And a Tinker may trapan the State;  Such Fortunate Foes as these be,  Turn'd the Crown to a Cross at _Naseby_:  Father and Mother, Sister and Brother confounded,  And many a good Family wounded;    By a terrible turn of Fate,  He that can kill a Man, thunder and plunder the Town, Sir,  And pull his Enemies down, Sir,    In time may be an Officer great.    It is the Sword does order all,    Makes Peasants rise, and Princes fall;  All Sylogisms in vain are spilt,    No Logick like a Basket-hilt:    It handles 'em joint by joint Sir,  Quilling and drilling, and spilling, and Killing profoundly,  Until the Disputers on Ground lie,    And have never a word to say;  Unless it be Quarter, Quarter, Truth is confuted by a Carter,  By stripping and nipping, and ripping and quipping Evasions,  Doth Conquer a Power of Perswasions,    _Aristotle_ hath lost the Day.

And how't will rejoyce you, I'll make it out plain,  Will make our Trade quick, and more Money will gain.    There's none of the pitiful Tribe we'll be for,  And Six-penny Customers we will abhor;  For all those that will our Dominions invade,  Must pay for their sauce, we must live by our Trade.    _Gil._ Good Sister if you can make this but appear,  My Spirit and Senses you greatly will chear,  But a Famine of Flesh will bring all things to pass,  Or else we are as bad still as ever we was.    _Bett._ Lately a Counsel of Bauds there did meet,  In _Cock_ and _Pye_ Alley, near _Do-little_ Street:  And who was the Counsel, and what was there done;  I'll make it out to you as clear as the Sun.

The two Metropolitans came from the Park,  As arch at the Game, as e'er plaid in the Dark;  Then _Lutener's_-lane a gay Couple did bring,  Two better, I think, was ne'er stretch'd in hemp-string.    There was many others from Places remote,  The which were too tedious for me here to note;  And what was their Business I here will declare,  How to keep our Trade in Repute they take care.    And first for those Ladies that walk in the Night,  Their Aprons and Handkerchiefs they should be white,  And that they do walk more in Town than in Fields,  For that is the Place most Variety yields.    And those that are over-much worn by their Trade,  Shall go in a Vessel, their Passage being paid;  The Venture of Cuckolds, 'tis called by Name,  And this is the way for to keep up our Fame.    And this is the Ship which the Cuckolds have brought,  It lies at their Haven, and is to be frought:  And thither Whores rampant, that please may repair,  With Master and Captain to truck for their Ware.    And for a Supply that our trade may increase,  For wanton Commodity it will grow less;  We'll visit the Carriers, and take them up there,  And then for their Tutering we will take care.    In this we shall ease all the Countries to do't,  And do our selves Pleasure and Profit to boot;  For one that is crack'd in the Country before,  In _London_ will make a spick and span Whore.    There's many more Precepts which they did advise,  But these which I'll give you here shall suffice:  And when you have heard them, I think you will say,  We ne'er were more likely to thrive in our way.      _Some Orders agreed upon at a General Consultation of the_ Sisterhood  _of_ Nightingale-lane, Ratcliff-high-way, Tower-Ditch, Rose-mary-lane,  Hatton-Wall, Saffron-hill, Wetstone's-Park, Lutener's-lane, _and other  Places adjacent, for the general Encouragement and Advancement of  their Occupation._    I.    _That no_ Night-walker _presume to go without a White Apron and  Handkerchief, the better to be seen._    II.
