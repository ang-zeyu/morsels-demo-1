Six o'clock on a sunny  autumn evening is the time to wait in Farnham churchyard. Every three  hours the mellow, feeble bells ring a chime which suits September  twilight:--        \"Life let us cherish      While yet the taper glows,      And the fresh floweret      Pluck ere it close.        Away with every toil and care,      And cease the rankling thorn to wear;      With manful hearts life's conflict meet,      Till Death sounds the retreat.\"    Vernon House, a Tudor building changed from its old name, Culver Hall,  and altered so as to front on West Street, has an unhappy memory of the  Parliament wars. Charles the First lodged there one December night, a  closely guarded prisoner on his way from Hurst Castle to Windsor. A  month later he was to leave Windsor for Whitehall. He had little to give  his host, and gave him all he had. It was a white morning cap of quilted  silk, which Mr. George Vernon, inheriting from his grandfather, left in  1732 to his grandson, \"desiring it may always go to the next heir male  of my family, as a testimony of our steadfast loyalty and adherence to  the Crown, which is the only bounty my family ever received for all the  losses and expenses they sustained for the royal cause, which amounted  to several thousands of pounds.\"    [Illustration: _In Farnham Churchyard._]    I had nearly forgotten Farnham's painter. He was Stephen Elmer, and a  picture of his, \"The Last Supper,\" hangs in the church tower. But his  forte was painting fish and game, dead and alive. In a curious old  pamphlet, \"_The Earwig, or An Old Woman's Remarks on the present  Exhibition of Pictures of the Royal Academy--a critical pamphlet  published in Fleet Street_, 1781, I find the following entries. Of the  painters and subjects, Mr. Elmer and Mrs. Robinson belong to Surrey. The  rest supply the setting:--        \"10. Thais--Sir Joshua Reynolds, R.A.--The face was painted from the      famous Emily Bertie ... It was a cruel _snouch_ in the Painter, a      fine Girl having paid him seventy-five guineas for an hour's work,      and being unable to pay for the other half of her portrait, to      exhibit her with such a sarcastic allusion to her private life--to      call her Thais--to put a torch in her hand, and direct her to set      flames to the temple of Chastity. Such rigorous punishment seldom is      inflicted by a rich man on a pretty woman, merely from her want of      money.        79. Damn'd bad.        106. Mrs. Mahon in the character of Elvira--J. Roberts.--Painting,      painted.        107. Portrait of Mrs. Robinson--J. Roberts.--At some distance the      effect nearly the same as the preceding number; but on closer      inspection, the colour not quite so thickly laid on. We must do      justice to the Exhibiting Artists by saying that there are no worse      _of their size_ in the room than these Dulcineas.        129. Brace of Pheasants--S. Elmer, A.--No artist can come nearer to      the object he attempts. His fish, his birds, and fruit are as      exquisitely fine as any of the Flemish masters.\"    The National Gallery lacks an Elmer: private collectors may be luckier.  Mr. J.E. Harting, to whom all Surrey naturalists owe a debt, reminds me  that many of Elmer's best pictures were engraved to illustrate Daniel's  _Rural Sports_, and that it was Elmer who painted the picture of the  hybrid between a blackcock and a pheasant which readers of _Selborne_  will remember was sent by Lord Stawell to Gilbert White. \"It had been  found by the spaniels of one of his keepers in a coppice, and shot on  the wing.\"    [Illustration: _Frensham Pond._]          CHAPTER III    FRENSHAM AND TILFORD        A Surrey Labourer.--The Witch's Caldron.--Frensham Ponds.--The Last      of the Blackcock.--Herons and Waterlilies.--The Tilford      Oak.--Cobbett's Mistake.--Silver Billy.--The heroic age of      Cricketers.      Farnham has expanded to the south-east, and not prettily. But it is the  key to the great stretch of pine wood, heather and bogland which lies to  the south about Frensham, Tilford and Crooksbury Hill; and it is the  best centre from which to visit Waverley Abbey and Moor Park, and to  take long walks over some of the wildest country in the county. A week  would not be long enough to explore the dozen square miles south of the  town.    Wrecclesham lies to the south-west, almost on the Hampshire border, and  still makes green pottery of patterns which were favourites in the  sixteenth century. Further south runs the tiny Bourne, the stream by  which Cobbett and his brothers had so good an education, as we have just  seen, in the sand. The Bourne, which runs dry in summer, has few  associations as a stream; one, perhaps, will remain with it. Readers of  _The Bettesworth Book_ and _Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer_ will perhaps  not be very wrong if they fix on this sandy valley as the Surrey which  Bettesworth knew best. Than the _Memoirs_, I think, no more discerning  study of an old labourer's fight to keep on his own legs, out of the  workhouse, earning his own money with his spade and hoe, belongs to any  Surrey village.    [Illustration: _Pierrepont House and Bridge._]    Deep country begins south of the Bourne, with the first Surrey bridge  over the Wey, or rather one of the two Weys that are to join at Tilford.  Untouched as yet by any town, the little river runs here over gravel and  sand, clear and weedy. Trout lie under the bridge below Pierrepont  House, in George III's day a seat of Evelyn Duke of Kingston, who named  it after his family. He was the Duke who married the beautiful Countess  of Bristol when her lawful husband was still alive: perhaps she used to  stare into the Wey at Pierrepont and wonder whether it was worth doing.    [Illustration: _Beside Frensham Pond._]    Frensham stands a little distant from the river, just a cottage or two  and a church. But the church holds a famous relic--an enormous caldron  of beaten copper. Nobody knows its age; everybody has a story about it.  It was brought by the fairies, is one tradition; it was nothing of the  kind, is another. Mother Ludlam, the witch of Moor Park, four miles  away, used it for boilings and philtremakings, according to one story;  yet another connects it with a great stone which used to lie in the  neighbourhood. John Aubrey, the antiquary, who \"perambulated\" Surrey in  1673 and 1674, gives the legend in full:--        \"In the vestry of the church, on the north side of the chancel, is      an extraordinary great kettle or caldron, which the inhabitants say,      by tradition, was brought hither by the fairies, time out of mind,      from Borough hill, about a mile from hence. To this place, if any      one went to borrow a yoke of oxen, money, etc., he might have it for      a year or longer so he kept his word to return it. There is a cave      where some have fancied to hear music. On this Borough hill (in the      Tithing of Cherte, in the parish of Frensham) is a great stone lying      along, of the length of about six feet: they went to this Stone, and      knocked at it, and declared that they would borrow, and when they      would repay, and a Voice would answer when they should come, and      that they should find what they desired to borrow at that Stone.      This caldron, with the trivet, was borrowed here after the manner      aforesaid, but not returned according to promise; and though the      caldron was afterwards carried to the stone, it could not be      received, and ever since that time no borrowing there....        \"The people saw a great fire one night (not long since), the next      day they went to see if any heath was burnt there, but found      nothing.\"    [Illustration: _Frensham Pond Hotel._]    \"These stories,\" says Aubrey, \"are verily believed by most of the old  women of this parish, and by many of their daughters.\" The daughters  ought to have known better. So ought Aubrey, according to Salmon,  another Surrey historian, writing in 1736. He cannot understand why  there should be anything astonishing about the size of the caldron,  \"there having been many in England till lately to be seen, as well as  very large spits which were given for entertainment of the parish at the  wedding of poor maids.\" It was a notable thing to roast an ox whole.  Clearly it would be satisfactory to boil a sheep.    [Illustration: _Frensham Pond._]    From Frensham village a road runs straight across the common to the  south-west corner of the Great Pond, but the prettiest road to the water  is by the side of the Wey. The Wey runs here deep and clean, edged with  forget-me-nots through all the summer, winding and straightening through  serene and shining pastures. There is nothing quieter in all Surrey than  this little path by the tiny river, with the bank on one side rich with  roses and elderflower, and on the other the sunlight gleaming on the  chestnut coats of the cattle moving slowly through the sedge. Here is an  old oak bridge, solid and lichened; here, facing the stream, a high bank  of white sand, bored and tunnelled by sand-martins; a little further,  and the brushwood flames with the pink and crimson spires of a thousand  foxgloves. The grassy path runs on, until on a sudden bend the ground  rises, and over a wooden stile opens out the vista of the great  Frensham Pond. Could there be a deeper contrast? Behind lies green  pasture-land, rush and sedge, oak and alder; before you, the shoulder of  a hill purple with ling, the long level of grey and silver water,  dancing under the wind away to a far strip of yellow sand flecked with  patches of white foam; high above that, burnt and blackened ridges of  heather-ground and gorse. Frensham Pond has often been painted, but that  is the view I should choose, as I saw it first.

God is there working a miracle;  such is Darwinism. According to Moses, He was doing just as well yonder in  Eden working a miracle with the dust of the earth. Now, in all candor,  tell us which statement is most worthy of God, the one that finds the  origin of man in the Eden earth with a miracle wrought upon the _dust_ of  the ground, or the one that finds his origin in a miracle wrought upon the  _mud of the Nile or the slime of the sea_? The one that stands him up  erect, a man, with Godlike attributes, or the one that lays him down in  the slimy mass to pass through ages upon ages in order to get out of his  low, slimy paternity and beastly traits of mere instinct, with groveling  habits of life? Darwin, conscious of the axiomatic truth that no more can  be evolved than there is involved, teaches the doctrine that variation or  change of species is brought about by causes which already existed in the  common progenitor. Such being true, we ask: In what link below man, in the  great evolutionary chain, is intellect and moral nature to be found?  Sensible men are turning, however, away from the old, threadbare, worn-out  guess-work. The time is not far distant when it will retire once more from  scientific thought. It is very old. Pliny, eighteen centuries ago, said:  \"The various kinds of apes offer an almost perfect resemblance to man in  their physical nature.\" This is just equal to Huxley's statement made in  our own nineteenth century, that, \"So far as structure is concerned, man  differs to no greater extent from the animals which are immediately below  him, than these do from other members of the same order.\" Hence his  conclusion: \"Man has proceeded from a modification or an improvement of  some lower animal, some simpler stock.\" This idea was fully expressed in  the early Pagan mythologies. Their satyrs or forest divinities were  creatures blending the animal with the human. So Anaximander, although an  advocate of the old hypothesis of evolution, was not the originator of the  thought. The old _guess-up_ had its origin in Pagan mythology. The Fauns  of the Roman legend were supposed to be the transition species, or bridge  across the chasm between the brute creation and man--a notion found in  Hawthorne's \"Marble Faun.\" So it is plain that evolution, in Darwin's  sense of the term, does not lie between new discoveries in science and old  dogmas in religion, but it does lie between speculation in science and old  dogmas in paganism--poor science, she carries much that does not belong to  her! Evolution of species from other species is an idea found in heathen  mythology; it is also found in the ancient heathen cosmogonies. The God of  flocks and shepherds among the Greeks was a compound creature having the  horns and feet of a goat and the face of a man. He was, doubtless, as near  an approach to man as Darwin's imaginary link at some imaginary point in  his imaginary evolution.    This question is not one of progressive order in the same species, but a  question relative to one species rising out of another of lower grade, and  especially the development of man from the lower animals. Agassiz says,  \"Some have mistaken the action and reaction which exists everywhere in one  and the same species for a _causal_ connection,\" that is to say, these  influences produced the species, whereas the species must exist before any  such action and reaction can take place. The action of physical  influences, or external surrounding, _or environments_ upon species could  not take place unless the species _first existed_. Action and reaction in  one and the same species already existing, furnishes no evidence upon the  manner in which the species was first brought into existence. Darwin says:  \"The creation of organic matter having already taken place, my object is  to show in consequence of what laws, or what demonstrable properties of  organic matter, and of its environments, such states of organic nature as  those with which we are acquainted must have come about.\" Well, Mr. Darwin  will never get nearer the truth upon this great question than he was when  he marched boldly up to miraculous intervention in order to get his first  unit, or living organism to place at the beginning of his evolutionary  series, unless he comes back to Moses and takes Christian ground. Geology  does not teach that species have been evolved from lower species. Geology  declares that new forms are new expressions of creative power. All the  physical forces that were operating upon our earth in the inorganic  period, are in operation now. Why, O why, has it been that the experience  and observation of the ages, as well as the record in the rocks, have  failed to give, in all the earth, one sensible demonstration in support of  the proposition that man, or any other species, was evolved from an  inferior species? The answer is easy--blind physical forces were, and are,  insufficient to bring into existence living being. Throughout every  department of creation there are evidences of invisible or spiritual  powers that lie behind the events that come under observation in science.  Chemical affinity lies behind, and produces important changes that take  place in organic matter. But chemical affinities do not explain living,  organic, being; for we have our existence at the expense of chemical  affinities. The living force, whatever it may be, lies behind chemical  affinities, and controls them. Instinct influences many of the  manifestations in animal life, and intelligence controls the sober conduct  of men. Yet above all these there is that wonderful builder and overseer  of the organism called life. As nature was perfect in all her elementary  principles during the inorganic period, and as inertia was, and is, a  property of matter, it follows, necessarily, that life was a new  principle, from an immaterial source, otherwise inertia is not a property  of matter; for a thing can not be--exist and not be at the same time.    Vogt reasons in favor of evolution of species from a few abnormal--that is  deteriorated--human beings, which is the mistake spoken of by Agassiz, that  action and reaction in one and the same species produce species. Action  and reaction does not produce the species, nor yet _another species_. Men  and apes have lived side by side for thousands of years. Why is it that  apes have made no advance towards the human form? Poor fellows! An ape is  always an ape, and a man is always a man. The geological record upon the  rocks is in favor of man's existence as man by creative interposition. The  evolution hypothesis rests its conclusions upon effects that well-known  causes have never been known to produce, for the evolution of species from  lower species was never known anywhere in history or fact. In reference to  Darwin's ideas upon the origin of species, Mr. Huxley said: \"That,  notwithstanding the clearness of the style, those who attempt fairly to  digest the book find much of it a sort of intellectual pemmican--a mass of  facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the  ordinary medium of a logical bond.\" The impossibility of a scientific test  is admitted, for vast periods of time in the infinite past are claimed for  the work of natural selection. Countless ages form the basis of the  system, without which it could not have brought about the present order of  things. But an infinite series of life forms upon our earth could not be  possible, for it has been shown, allowing that the heat has passed out of  our earth uniformly, as it does at present, that inside of a comparatively  limited period in the past, it must have been so intensely hot as to have  been capable of melting a mass of rock equal to the bulk of the whole  earth. Yet Darwin has his half developed--imaginary animals strewn along  there in the infinite ages of the past. Men may get around this difficulty  by disregarding the facts of science and of common sense, or by doing as  Tyndall did; that is, by taking up the mechanism of the human body, the  mind itself, emotion, intellect, will and all their phenomena, and  _latentizing_ them in a fire cloud. Tyndall says: \"They were once _latent_  in a fiery cloud.\" Farewell to common sense or Darwinism--which shall it  be? Darwin's idea that all the causes of evolution were placed in a common  progenitor, by a miraculous creation of that common progenitor is in very  poor harmony with his denial of design in nature, and also in poor harmony  with the idea of environments contributing so extensively to the change of  species; for if all the causes were placed in a common progenitor, of  course, they are not to be found in the least degree in environment. If  all was placed in a common progenitor, brought into existence by a  miracle, as Darwin teaches, how is design to be excluded from nature?  Imperfections in nature are urged against design in nature by all the  school of evolutionists. But what kind of imperfection is that which is  involved in the idea of God creating a common progenitor, lying at the  base of Darwin's series of evolution, possessing all the causes of all  effects in nature, without designing those effects? What wonderful  undesigned results!    There are those, among unbelievers, who profess to see no evidences of a  designing intelligence in all the harmonies of nature, and yet profess to  see the far off man behind the old stone ax. What wonderful intelligence  they have! There is no want of intelligence; it is want of something else,  which Christianity requires. I think so much of your common sense that I  will leave you to say what that is. Socrates said: \"When I was young it  was surprising how earnestly I desired that species of science which they  call physical, for it appeared to me pre-eminently excellent in bringing  us to know the causes of each, through what each is produced and"]]]
