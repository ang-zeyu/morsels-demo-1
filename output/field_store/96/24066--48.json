There was no need to be silent, and Dyke kept on shouting remarks to his  brother as they cantered on over the dry bush and sand.    \"I don't think much of lions, after all, Joe,\" he said; \"they're not  half kings of beasts like you see in pictures and read of in books.\"    \"You haven't seen one in a rage, old fellow,\" said Emson  good-humouredly.    \"I don't believe they'd be anything much if they were,\" said Dyke  contemptuously.  \"They always seem to me to be creeping and sneaking  about like a cat after a mouse.  Now look at those great strong things  going off like that, as soon as they see us, instead of roaring at us  and driving us away.\"    \"Smell powder, perhaps, and are afraid of the guns.\"    \"Well, but if they did, that isn't being brave as a lion, Joe.  Why,  when they killed the white ox, there were four of them, and they did it  in the dark.  I don't believe when you shot that the bullet went near  either of the brutes.\"    \"No, but we scared them off.\"    \"They killed the poor old bullock first, though.\"    \"Well, didn't that give you a good idea of a lion's strength; the poor  beast's neck was broken.\"    \"Let's show them to-day that we are stronger, and break _their_ necks,\"  said Dyke.  \"Look out: they're gone.\"  For the two great beasts suddenly  plunged into a patch of broken ground, where great blocks of granite  stood up from among the bushes, and sheltered them with larger growth.    It was the only hiding-place in sight, and for this the lions had made,  and now disappeared.    \"We shan't get a shot at them now, old chap,\" cried Emson; \"they lie as  snug as rats among those bushes.  We want old Duke here.\"    \"Oh, don't give up,\" cried Dyke.  \"I know that place well; it's where I  found the aardvark, and the bushes are quite open.  I am sure we can see  them.\"    \"Well, as you're so set on it, we'll try; but mind this, no riding in--  nothing rash, you know.\"    \"Oh, I'll take care,\" cried Dyke.  \"I shan't get hurt.  You only have to  ride right at them, and they'll run.\"    \"I don't know so much about that, old cocksure; but mind this, horses  are horses, and I don't want you to get Breezy clawed.\"    \"And I don't want to get him clawed--do I, old merry legs?\" cried the  boy, bending forward to pat his nag's neck.  \"Sooner get scratched  myself, wouldn't I, eh?\"    The little horse tossed up its head and shook its mane, and then taking  his master's caress and words to mean a call upon him for fresh effort,  he dashed off, and had to be checked.    \"Steady, steady, Dyke, boy,\" cried Emson; \"do you hear?\"    \"Please sir, it wasn't me,\" replied the boy merrily.  \"It was him.\"    \"No nonsense!\" cried Emson sternly.  \"Steady!  This is not play.\"    Dyke glanced once at his brother's face as he rode up, and saw that it  looked hard, earnest, and firm.    \"All right, Joe,\" he said quietly; \"I will mind.\"    The next minute they had cantered gently up to the patch, which was only  about an acre in extent, and the bushes so thin and scattered that they  could see nearly across where the lions had entered.    But there was no sign of the cunning beasts.    \"Look here, Joe; you ride round that way, and I'll go this; then we are  sure to see them.\"    \"Capital plan,\" said Emson sarcastically.  \"Bravo, general! weaken your  forces by one-half, and then if I see them I can't fire for fear of  hitting you, and you can't fire for fear of hitting me.  Try again,  clever one.\"    \"Oh, all right, you try,\" said Dyke, in an offended tone.    \"Ride round with me, then, either five yards in front or five behind.  Will you go first?\"    \"No, you go,\" said Dyke distantly.    \"Come along, then.  Keep a sharp lookout, and if you get a good chance  at the shoulder--fire.  Not without.\"    \"Very well,\" said Dyke shortly, \"but you see if they don't sneak out and  gallop away on the other side.\"    \"They won't leave cover if they can help it,\" said Emson; and his words  proved true, for as they rode slowly round with finger on trigger,  scanning the openings, the cunning brutes glided in and out among the  great boulders, and crawled through the bushes, so that not a glimpse of  them could be obtained.    \"There!\" cried Dyke, after they had ridden round twice.  \"I knew it.  While we were talking on one side, they've crept out on the other and  gone off!  They're miles away now.\"    \"Exactly!\" said Emson; \"and that's why the horses are so uneasy.  I say,  little un, you don't get on so fast as I should like with your hunting  knowledge.  Look at Breezy.\"    Dyke glanced at his cob, and the little horse showed plainly enough by  its movements that whatever might be its master's opinion, it was  feeling convinced that the lions were pretty close at hand.    \"Well, what shall we do--ride through?\"    \"No,\" said Emson decidedly, \"that would be inviting a charge.  I'm  afraid we must separate, or we shall never got a shot.  As we ride round  one side, they creep along on the other.\"    \"Did you see them?\"    \"No, but look there.\"    Dyke looked where his brother pointed, and saw plainly marked in the  soft sand the footprints of the lions.    \"Well, let's separate, then,\" said the boy eagerly.  \"I'll mind and not  shoot your way, if you'll take care not to hit me.\"    \"Very good: we'll try, then; but be careful not to fire unless you get a  good sure chance.  Look here; this will be the best plan.  One of us  must sit fast here while the other rides round.\"    \"But the one who stops will get the best chance, for the game will be  driven towards him.  Who's to stop?\"    Emson thrust his hand into his pocket, and drew it out again clenched.    \"Something or nothing?\" he cried.    \"Nothing,\" said Dyke sharply.    \"Nothing.  Right.  Your chance,\" said Emson.    \"Then I'll stay here?\"    \"Very well then; be ready.  I shall ride ahead, and the lions will sneak  round till they find you are here, and then they'll either go right  across, or break cover and gallop off.  There's every chance for a shot.  Right forward in the shoulder, mind.\"    \"Won't charge me, will they?\"    \"Not unless they're wounded,\" replied Emson.--\"Ready?\"    \"Yes.\"    Emson rode slowly off, and as he went he kept on crying \"Here!\" at every  half-dozen yards or so, giving his brother a good idea of his position  and that of the lions too.    Meanwhile Dyke, with his heart beginning to beat heavily, sat facing in  the other direction, both barrels of his rifled piece cocked and pointed  forward, nostrils distended like those of his horse, and, also like the  animal, with every sense on the alert.    \"Here--here--here,\" came from beyond him, and gradually working more and  more to the left, while Dyke felt a great deal more respect for the  prowess and daring of lions than he did half an hour before.    The stillness, broken only by his brother's recurring cry, repeated with  such regularity, seemed awful, and the deep low sigh uttered by Breezy  sounded quite startling; but there was nothing else--no sound of the  powerful cats coming cautiously round, winding in and out among the  rocks and bushes, and not a twig was stirred.    \"Here--here--here,\" kept coming, and Dyke sat gripping the saddle  tightly with his knees, feeling a curious quiver pass into him from the  horse's excited nerves, as the swift little beast stood gazing before it  at the ragged shrubs, ready to spring away on the slightest sign of  danger.  The rein lay upon its neck, and its ears were cocked right  forward, while Dyke's double barrel was held ready to fire to right or  left of those warning ears at the first chance.    There was the clump on the boy's left, the open ground of the veldt on  his right, and the sun glancing down and making the leaves of the trees  hot; but still there was nothing but the regular \"Here--here--here,\"  uttered in Emson's deep bass.    \"They're gone,\" said Dyke to himself, with a peculiar sense of relief,  which made his breath come more freely.  \"They would have been here by  now.  I'll shout to Joe.\"    But he did not.  For at that moment there was the faintest of faint  rustles about a dozen yards in front.  One of the thin bushes grew  gradually darker, and Dyke had a glimpse of a patch of rough hair raised  above the leaves.  Then Breezy started violently, and in an instant two  lions started up.    \"_How_!--_Haugh_!\" was roared out.  The maneless lion bounded out of the  bushes, and went away over the sand in a series of tremendous leaps,  while the companion, a huge beast with darkly-tipped mane, leaped as if  to follow, but stopped and faced the boy, with head erect and tail  lashing from side to side, while the horse stood paralysed with fear,  its legs far apart, as if to bear the coming charge, and every nerve and  muscle on the quiver.    Dyke sat motionless during those brief moments, knowing that he ought to  fire, but feeling as if he were suffering from nightmare, till the  majestic beast before him gave vent to a tremendous roar, turned, and  bounded away.    Then Dyke's power of action came back.  Quick as a flash, his piece was  to his shoulder, and he fired; but the lion bounded onward, hidden for  the time by the smoke; yet as it cleared away, the boy had another clear  view of the beast end on, and fired once more.    At this there was a savage snarl; the lion made a bound sidewise, and  then swung round as if to charge back at its assailant, when Breezy tore  off at full speed, but had not gone fifty yards before another shot rang  out, and Dyke looked round to see his brother dismounted and kneeling on  the sand, while the lion was trailing itself along with its  hind-quarters paralysed.    In another minute Emson had remounted and ridden up to the dangerous  beast; there was another report from close quarters, and the lion rolled  over and straightened itself out.    \"Dead?\" cried Dyke excitedly, as he mastered "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#8)"],[1,"like that, is there no danger?    No, there is no danger, for the Papas are taking good care of the  Mammas and the children, as I have told you before.    But, you may say, the Papas do not seem to be doing anything; they are  just feeding and moving along. Then how are they taking care of the  Mammas and the children?    Yes, but look carefully! See how close the horn of one Papa is to the  horn of the next one! Why, there is not more than a couple of yards  between the two! If there were any sudden danger, it would not take  more than two or three steps for them to close up, and stand horn to  horn.      _How Buffaloes Know Danger is Coming--Three Ways_    \"But how could they _know_ if any danger were coming?\" you may still  ask.    They could know it in three ways: they could _smell_ the danger, or  _hear_ it, or _see_ it. I shall tell you how they do all that.    First, if the danger came from the direction in which the wind was  blowing, they would sniff the air, and so _smell_ the danger. If the  danger were a tiger, the buffaloes could smell him half a mile off;  that is about as far as ten blocks in a city. And if the wind were not  blowing that way, the buffaloes could still smell the tiger five  blocks away. They could smell the tiger, or any other danger, even if  it came from behind.    The second way of finding out the danger is to _hear_ it. As I said a  little while ago, if you should put your foot on a rotten twig, the  buffaloes could hear the sound of it as far off as five blocks. And  even if the danger came from behind, or from the side, or from  anywhere, they could still hear it coming, if it made the least bit of  sound that you and I could not hear.    The third way of finding out the danger is to _see_ it. The buffaloes  do that by keeping a lookout nearly all the time. I shall show you  how.    Just watch for a minute the buffalo in the middle of the crescent; he  is the leader of the herd. We can see him only from the back; but as  he is the biggest and tallest buffalo there, we can make him out quite  easily. He is grazing quietly, and then moving along.    But see, what is he doing now? Why, he is looking up, straight ahead  of him! No, he sees no danger there. So he gives a glance to his  right, and then to his left. No, there is no danger there either. So  he puts down his head, and starts feeding again.    Thus, you see, every now and again he looks to see that no danger is  coming from anywhere in _front_ of the herd.    But what if any danger came from the _side_ of the herd,--right near  the end of the crescent,--or even from the _back_ of the herd?      _Buffalo Sentinels_    Let us see what the two buffaloes at the two ends of the crescent are  doing. They are the watchers, or _sentinels_, as they are sometimes  called. They keep a lookout nearly all the time.    Do you see the one on our left? After every two or three mouthfuls he  stops, and takes a look around; he even looks right to the back. Then  he takes four or five strides to catch up with the herd, and starts  grazing again. Then in a minute or two he takes another look around in  the same way.    And the sentinel on our right is doing just the same. Yes, the herd is  quite safe; the two sentinels are sure to see if any danger comes  from their side or from the back.    \"But will not the sentinels have less to eat, if they are watching  half the time?\" you may ask.    Yes, that is quite true. So all the Papa buffaloes take turns being  sentinels. After a while the two sentinels from the ends move up  toward the middle, and the next ones then begin to keep watch. And  they keep changing places like that from day to day. That makes it  quite fair for everybody.    When they go to sleep also they are arranged in the form of a  crescent; but the two ends are closed up, so that the Papas make a  ring, while the Mammas and the children sleep inside the ring.    When the Papas lie down, they are closer together than when they are  feeding; and they still keep their heads pointed to the outside of the  ring, so that they can get up in a minute, and be quite ready to drive  off any tiger. Of course they have sentinels keeping watch all the  time.    But now let us see other wonderful things that the buffaloes do, while  they are feeding.    We must be very careful how we follow the herd. The ground is now  changing, and getting quite rough; so the grass is getting scarce here  and there. The buffaloes have not enough grass all the way; so they  have to walk on a few yards without eating, till they come to the next  patch.    Some of the buffaloes are even having a bite at fresh young shrubs in  passing, as they will eat anything green, when they have not enough  grass.    But see! The buffaloes are spreading out, as there are not even enough  shrubs in one place. You can see gaps in the line of buffaloes now.  And the gaps are getting bigger and bigger! Let us watch a few  minutes.    Now the gaps are very wide, as some of the buffaloes are lagging  behind; and some are turning too much to the side in trying to reach a  mouthful from a shrub or a bush here and there.    Why, what is happening now? Some of the buffaloes cannot even see one  another now, because of the bushes between them! What are the  sentinels doing? And what is the leader doing? Suppose a tiger  suddenly comes--    But do you _hear_ that?    \"Moo! Moo!\"    That is the leader. He has just found out that the herd is spread out  too far; so he is calling. He is saying, \"Where are you?\"    \"Moo! Moo!\" Do you hear that answer? It comes from the sentinel on the  right, who is very far away now; but still he has heard the call. His  answer means, \"Here I am!\"    And \"Here I am!\" comes the answer also from the sentinel on the left.    \"Then close up!\" cries the leader.    Each sentinel moves up toward the place from which he heard the  leader's voice come. And on his way there he tells all the buffaloes  he meets to move up also. Besides, all the buffaloes hear the leader's  voice too; so they begin to close up at once.    Is not that a wonderful way of bringing up all those that are lagging  behind?    But let us watch the herd again. They have closed up now, and there is  no big gap in their line. The ground is level again.    Let us move on from thicket to thicket, and come as near the buffaloes  as we can.    What is that? See! The sentinel on the right is looking hard at that  jungle grass far away to the side. This kind of jungle grass grows  very tall, taller than a man. But why is the sentinel staring at the  tall grass? What does he see there?    Yes, there, far away, something is happening! The jungle grass is  waving gently, but just in one place! What is making the tall grass  wave like that? Is it the wind? No, it cannot be the wind! Why not?  Because if it were the wind, _all_ the grass there would wave. Then  what is making the tall grass wave in just one place?    It can be only one thing! Some _animal_ is hiding there in the tall  grass! And as the animal is coming nearer and nearer to the buffaloes,  he is making the grass wave!    See, the sentinel has guessed that also! What is he doing now? Can you  _hear_ him? He gives a bellow, deep and long.    \"Danger! Look out!\" That is what he means.    The whole herd hears him. They all close up as near together as they  can!    Quick! Let us get up on that tree near by! _We_ are in danger as well  as the buffaloes!    One branch higher--and another! Now we are quite safe! But see what  the buffaloes are doing!      _Buffaloes Make a Ring when Tiger Comes_    The two ends of the crescent have come close together, and all the  Papa buffaloes have made a perfect ring around the Mammas and the  children. The Papas are facing the outside of the ring; so they can  meet the danger from whatever side it comes.    Why do they do that? Look again at the grass! The tall grass is waving  nearer and nearer. So, the animal that is in the grass is coming  nearer and nearer.    He comes right to the end of the tall grass. There he makes a gap in  the grass, and walks out into the open. It is a tiger!    He was trying to sneak up to the buffaloes; but the sentinel found  that out. And now the bull buffaloes are ready for him. The tiger  growls in rage. He prowls round and round the ring of bull buffaloes,  as you see in the picture. But he dare not try to break through those  horns.    He roars with fury, shaking the ground; it is just like thunder. The  jungle around is taking fright at the roar. See! All the small animals  rush out in fright--wild pigs, wild goats, and all sorts of small  deer.    [Illustration: The Tiger and the Ring of Buffaloes]    In their fright they run hither and thither very stupidly. That is  exactly why the tiger roars--he wants to make the small animals behave  so stupidly, in their fright, that some of them may make a mistake and  run straight into his jaws.    See! The small animals scatter to right and left, trying to reach a  bush or thicket. But some are cut off from safety, as the tiger stands  in their way. What can they do?      _Small Animals Find Safety in Buffalo Ring_    Yes, there is the ring of buffaloes! So those small animals rush  straight toward the ring and creep inside--and the buffaloes raise  their heads to make a way for them under the horns. Some of them, like  the wild goats, jump _over_ the buffaloes' horns to get inside the  ring. Anyway, the small animals reach safety inside with the Mammas  and the children of the buffaloes.    The tiger stands outside the ring, and still roars in fury. But now  nobody is afraid. The bull buffaloes paw the ground impatiently with  their hoofs, and rattle their horns. They are going to charge!    But that tiger does not wait for the charge. He does not want to be  trampled into a mess. So he slouches away, growling and snarling.    So, as you see, the bull buffaloes guard the Mammas and the children  from danger, and"]]]
