(#8)"],[1,"set sail for Reggio in Calabria, and  Catania and Syracuse in Sicily, whence they again embarked, and,  after touching at Cos and Samos, landed at Ephesus in Asia Minor,  where they visited the tombs of St. John the Evangelist, of Mary  Magdalene, and of the seven sleepers of Ephesus, that is, seven  Christians martyred in the time of the Emperor Decius.    They made some stay at Patara and at Mitylene, and then went to  Cyprus and Paphos; we next find the party, seven in number, at  Edessa, visiting the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle. Here they were  arrested as spies, and thrown into prison by the Saracens, but the  king, on the petition of a Spaniard, set them at liberty. As soon as  they were set free they left the town in great haste, and from that  time their route is almost the same as that of the Bishop Arculphe;  they visited Damascus, Nazareth, Cana, where they saw a wonderful  amphora on Mount Tabor, where our Lord was transfigured, and the  Lake of Tiberias, where St. Peter walked upon the water; Magdala,  where Lazarus and his sister dwelt; Capernaum, where our Lord raised  to life the son of the nobleman; Bethsaida in Galilee, the native  place of St. Peter and St. Andrew; Chorazin, where our Lord cured  those possessed with devils; Caesarea, and the spot where our Lord  was baptized, as well as Jericho and Jerusalem.    They also went to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the Mount of Olives,  and to Bethlehem, the scene of the murder of the Innocents by Herod,  and Gaza. While they were at Gaza, Willibald tells us that he  suddenly became blind, while he was in the church of St. Matthias,  and only recovered his sight two months afterwards, as he entered  the church of the Holy Cross at Jerusalem. He went through the  valley of Diospolis or Lydda, ten miles from Jerusalem, and then  went to Tyre and Sidon, and thence, by Libanus, Damascus, Caesarea,  and Emmaus, back to Jerusalem, where the travellers spent the winter.    This was not to be the limit of their exploration, for we hear of  them at Ptolemais, Emesa, Jerusalem, Damascus, and Samaria, where St.  John the Baptist is said to have been buried, and at Tyre, where it  must be confessed that Willibald defrauded the revenue of that time  by smuggling some balsam that was very celebrated, and on which a  duty was levied. On quitting Tyre they went to Constantinople and  lived there for two years before returning by Sicily, Calabria,  Naples, and Capua. The English pilgrim reached the monastery of  Monte Cassino, just ten years after his first setting out on his  travels; but his time of rest had not yet come, as he was appointed  to a bishopric in Franconia by Pope Gregory III. He was forty-one  years of age when he was made bishop, and he lived forty years  afterwards. In 938 he was canonized by Leo VII.    We will conclude the list of celebrated travellers living between  the first and ninth centuries, by giving a short account of Soleyman,  a merchant of Bassorah, who, starting from the Persian Gulf, arrived  eventually on the shores of China. This narrative is in two distinct  parts, one written in 851, by Soleyman himself, who was the  traveller, and the other in 878 by a geographer named Abou-Zeyd  Hassan with the view of completing the first. Renaud, the  orientalist, is of opinion that this narrative \"has thrown quite a  new light on the commercial transactions that existed in the ninth  century between Egypt, Arabia, and the countries bordering on the  Persian Gulf on one side, and the vast provinces of India and China  on the other.\"    Soleyman, as we have said, started from the Persian Gulf after  having taken in a good supply of fresh water at Muscat, and visited  first, the second sea, or that of Oman. He noticed a fish of  enormous size, probably a spermaceti whale, which the seamen  endeavoured to frighten away by ringing a bell, then a shark, in  whose stomach they found a smaller shark, enclosing in its turn one  still smaller, \"both alive,\" says the traveller, which is manifestly  an exaggeration; then, after describing the remora, the dactyloptera,  and the porpoise, he speaks of the sea near the Maldive Islands in  which he counted an enormous number of islands, among them he  mentions Ceylon by its Arabian name, with its pearl fisheries;  Sumatra, inhabited by cannibals, and rich in gold-mines; Nicobar,  and the Andaman Islands, where cannibalism still exists even at the  present day. \"This sea,\" he says, \"is subject to fearful  water-spouts which wreck the ships, and throw on its shores an  immense number of dead fish and sometimes even large stones. When  these tempests are at their height the sea seethes and boils.\"  Soleyman imagined it to be infested by a sort of monster who preyed  upon human beings; this is thought to have been a kind of dog-fish.    [Illustration: Soleyman noticed a shark in whose stomach they found  a smaller shark.]    Arrived at Nicobar, Soleyman traded with the inhabitants, bartering  some iron for cocoa-nuts, sugar-cane, bananas, &c.; he then crossed  the sea, and seems to have made for Singapore, and northwards by the  Gulf of Siam. Soleyman put into a harbour, near Cape Varella, to  revictual his ships, and thence he went by the China Sea to  Jehan-fou the port of the present town of Tche-kiang. The remainder  of the account of Soleyman's travels, written by Abou-Zeyd Hassan,  contains a detailed account of the manners and customs of the  Indians and Chinese; but it is not the traveller himself who is  speaking, and we shall find the same subjects spoken of in a more  interesting manner by later authors.    We must add, in reviewing the discoveries made by travellers sixteen  centuries before, and nine centuries after, the Christian era, that  from Norway to the extreme boundaries of China, taking a line  through the Atlantic ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the  Indian Ocean, and the Sea of China, the immense extent of coast  bordering these seas had been in a great measure visited. Some  explorations had been attempted in the interior of these countries;  for instance, in Egypt as far as Ethiopia, in Asia Minor to the  Caucasus, in India and China; and if these old travellers may not  have quite understood mathematical precision, as to some of the  points they visited, at all events the manners and customs of the  inhabitants, the productions of the different countries, the mode of  trading with them, and their religious customs, were quite  sufficiently understood. Ships could sail with more safety when the  change of winds was no longer a subject of mere speculation, the  caravans could take a more direct route in the interior of the  countries, and the great increase of trade which took place in the  middle ages is surely owing to the facilities afforded by the  writings of travellers.          CHAPTER III.  CELEBRATED TRAVELLERS BETWEEN THE TENTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES.    BENJAMIN OF TUDELA, 1159-1173; PLAN DE CARPIN, OR CARPINI,  1245-1247; RUBRUQUIS, 1253-1254.    The Scandinavians in the North, Iceland and Greenland--Benjamin of  Tudela visits Marseilles, Rome, Constantinople, the Archipelago,  Palestine, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Damascus, Baalbec, Nineveh, Baghdad,  Babylon, Bassorah, Ispahan, Shiraz, Samarcand, Thibet, Malabar,  Ceylon, the Red Sea, Egypt, Sicily, Italy, Germany, and France--  Carpini explores Turkestan--Manners and customs of the Tartars--  Rubruquis and the Sea of Azov, the Volga, Karakorum, Astrakhan, and  Derbend.      In the course of the tenth, and at the beginning of the eleventh  century, a considerable amount of ardour for exploration had arisen  in Northern Europe. Some Norwegians and adventurous Gauls had  penetrated to the Northern seas, and, if we may trust to some  accounts, they had gone as far as the White Sea and visited the  country of the Samoyedes. Some documents say that Prince Madoc may  have explored the American continent.    At all events we may be tolerably certain that Iceland was  discovered about A.D. 861 by some Scandinavian adventurers, and that  it was soon after colonized by Normans. About this same time a  Norwegian had taken refuge on a newly discovered land, and surprised  by its verdure he gave it the name of Greenland.    The communication with this portion of the American continent was  difficult and uncertain, and one geographer says \"it took five years  for a vessel to go from Norway to Greenland, and to return from  Greenland to Norway.\" Sometimes in severe winters the Northern Ocean  was completely frozen over, and a certain Hollur-Geit, guided by a  goat, was able to cross on foot from Norway to Greenland. We should  keep in mind that the period of which we are speaking is the time  when legends and traditions were very plentiful, and gained ready  credence.    Let us return to well-authenticated facts, and relate the journey of  a Spanish Jew, whose truthfulness is beyond question.    This Jew was the son of a rabbi of Tudela, a town in Navarre, and he  was called Benjamin of Tudela. It seems probable that the object of  his voyage was to make a census of his brother Jews scattered over  the surface of the Globe, but whatever may have been his motive, he  spent thirteen years, from 1160-1173, exploring nearly all the known  world, and his narrative was considered the great authority on this  subject up to the sixteenth century.    Benjamin of Tudela left Barcelona, and travelling by Tarragona,  Gironde, Narbonne, Beziers, Montpellier, Sunel, Pousquiers, St.  Gilles, and Arles, reached Marseilles. Here he visited the two  synagogues in the town and the principal Jews, and then set sail for  Genoa, arriving there in four days. The Genoese were masters of the  sea at that time, and were at war with the people of Pisa, a brave  people, who, like the Genoese, says the traveller, \"owned neither  kings nor princes, but only the judges whom they appointed at their  own pleasure.\"    After visiting Lucca, Benjamin of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#8)"],[1,"who will  attend my father. Montpensier and him will have surely capital fun  together, and he was, you know, a great favourite with every one at  Eu. If by chance Lord Hardwicke was in waiting during my father's  stay, you must kindly put my father in mind to thank him for the  _famous cheese_, which arrived safely, and was found very good....          [Pageheading: THE KING'S ARRIVAL]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _8th October 1844._    DEAREST UNCLE,--You will, I am sure, forgive my writing but a few  lines as I am all alone in the agitation of the dear King's arrival,  and I will leave my letter open to announce it to you. My _dearest_  master is gone to Portsmouth to receive him. The excitement and  curiosity to see the dear King, and the desire to give him a most  hearty reception, is _very great indeed_.    Many thanks for your kind letters of the 28th and 4th. I can't think  who could have said that Peel, etc., would _not_ have been here; for  he, Aberdeen, and the old Duke are to be here the whole time, and all  the other Ministers will come _during_ his stay.    I am very glad Joinville is arrived, and avoided his _entrees  triomphales_. I hope he will take great care of himself.    You will have heard from dear Louise of our voyage, etc. I cannot  reconcile myself to be _here_ again, and pine for my _dear_  Highlands, the hills, the pure air, the quiet, the retirement, the  liberty--_all_--more than is right. The children are well. I am sorry  to hear that you are not quite so yet.    3.30.--The King and Montpensier arrived quite safely at two, and are  both looking extremely well. We have just lunched with them. It seems  like a dream to me, and a very pleasant one.    Albert sends his affectionate love. Ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.    Bertie has immediately taken a passion for Montpensier.          _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._    BROCKET HALL, _9th October 1844._    Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks  your Majesty much for the letter of the 7th inst., which he has just  received, and with very great satisfaction, as he had begun to think  your Majesty's silence rather long. But he perfectly understands the  reasons which prevented your Majesty from writing during your stay in  the Highlands. Lord Melbourne is very glad to find that your Majesty  enjoyed that country so much, and is so enthusiastically fond of it.  Lord Melbourne believes that he was at the places which your Majesty  mentions. In the year 1802 he stayed some months in Perthshire with  the late Lord Kinnaird, and enjoyed it much. It annoys him sometimes  to think how altered he is in strength since that time. Lord Melbourne  has never yet thanked your Majesty for the pretty etchings of poor  Islay and Eos, which your Majesty sent to Lord Melbourne when he was  last at Windsor. Lord Melbourne has ordered them both to be framed,  and will hang them up in his room here. They will afford Lord  Melbourne most agreeable and pleasing souvenirs of the happiest period  of his life, for he cannot say otherwise than that he continually  misses and regrets the time when he had daily confidential  communication with your Majesty. Lord Glenlyon[30] has one merit  in Lord Melbourne's eyes, which is that he was a steady and firm  supporter to the last of Lord Melbourne's Government. Lord Melbourne  hopes and trusts that he feels no animosity against those who opposed  him. But he does and always shall entertain a kindly and grateful  recollection of those who supported him.    Lord Melbourne begs to be remembered to His Royal Highness.        [Footnote 30: _See_ vol. i. p. 429.]          _The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    LAEKEN, _12th October 1844._    MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--... I thank you very much for attending  to all my recommendations about _my_ father: I only fear that they  will lead you to believe that we consider him as a _great child_ and  treat him like one: but he is so _precious_ and _dear_ to _us all_  that I am sure you will _understand_ and _excuse_ our being _over  anxious_... Yours most devotedly,    LOUISE.          [Pageheading: A SUCCESSFUL VISIT]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    OSBORNE HOUSE, _17th October 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had intended to have written to you on Monday,  but you will since have heard of the great _confusion_ of that day  which prevented me from doing so. The dear King's visit went off to  perfection, and I much and deeply regret its being passed. He was  _delighted_, and was _most_ enthusiastically and affectionately  received wherever he showed himself. Our proceedings I wrote to good,  dear Louise (whom you should not leave so long alone), who will no  doubt have given you the details. What an extraordinary man the King  is! What a wonderful memory, and how lively, _how sagacious!_He spoke  very openly to us all, and is determined that our affairs should go on  well. He wishes Tahiti _au fond de la mer_. He spoke also very openly  about poor Hadjy's _brochure_ which seems to have distressed him more  than anything. The King praised my dearest Albert most highly, and  fully appreciates his great qualities and talents--and what gratifies  me _so much_, treats him completely as his equal, calling him \"Mon  Frere,\" and saying to me that _my husband_ was the same as me, which  it is--and \"Le Prince Albert, c'est pour moi le Roi.\" The King is  _very_ sad to go, but he is determined, he says, _to see me every  year_. Another _very_ great thing is, that the officers of the two  Navies staying at Portsmouth were on the best terms together and  paying one another every sort of compliment. As Admiral La Susse (a  very gentlemanlike man) and his squadron were sadly disappointed on  Monday,[31] we thought it would please them if we went on board the  _Gomer_, which we did, on Tuesday morning, and breakfasted there, and  I drank the King's health. I am certain that the visit and everything  connected with it can but do the _greatest good_.    We stay here till Monday. It is a very comfortable little house, and  the grounds and place are delightful, so private--and the view so  fine.    I must now conclude, begging you to believe me, ever your devoted  Niece,    VICTORIA R.    I forgot to say how much we liked good Montpensier, who got on  extremely well.        [Footnote 31: It had been intended that the King should return      to France, as he had come, by way of Portsmouth, crossing in      the frigate _Gomer_, but, in consequence of the wet and stormy      weather, he returned by Dover and Calais.]          [Pageheading: DEPARTURE OF THE KING]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the French._    OSBORNE HOUSE, _le 17 Octobre 1844._    SIRE, ET MON TRES CHER FRERE,--Votre Majeste m'a ecrit deux bien  bonnes lettres de Douvres pour lesquelles je vous remercie de tout mon  c[oe]ur. Les expressions de bonte et d'amitie que vous me vouez ainsi  qu'a mon cher Albert nous touchent sensiblement; je n'ai pas besoin  de vous dire encore, combien nous vous sommes attaches et combien nous  desirons voir se raffermir de plus en plus cette _entente  cordiale_ entre nos deux pays qui existe si heureusement entre nous  personnellement. C'etait avec un vif regret que nous nous sommes  separes de votre Majeste, et de Montpensier, et ce sera une grande  fete que de voir renouveler une visite dont le souvenir nous est si  cher.    Albert se met a vos pieds, Sire, bien sensible ainsi que moi-meme de  l'amitie et la confiance que vous lui avez temoignees.    J'ose prier votre Majeste d'offrir mes plus tendres hommages a la  Reine et a Madame votre S[oe]ur et de me rappeler au souvenir de  Montpensier. Je suis pour la vie, Sire et mon cher Frere, de votre  Majeste la bien affectionnee S[oe]ur et fidele Amie,    VICTORIA R.          [Pageheading: OPENING OF ROYAL EXCHANGE]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _29th October 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the happiness of receiving your kind letter  of the 26th while I was dressing to go to the City for the opening  of the Royal Exchange.[32] Nothing ever went off better, and the  procession there, as well as all the proceedings _at_ the Royal  Exchange, were splendid and royal in the extreme. It was a fine and  gratifying sight to see the myriads of people assembled--more than at  the Coronation even, and all in such good humour, and so loyal; the  articles in the papers, too, are most kind and gratifying; they say  _no_ Sovereign _was more_ loved than I am (I am bold enough to say),  and _that_, from our _happy domestic home_--which gives such a good  example. The _Times_ you have, and I venture to add a _Chronicle_,  as I think it very pretty; you should read the accounts. _I_ seldom  remember being so gratified and pleased with any public show, and my  beloved Albert was so enthusiastically received by the people. He  is _so_ beloved by all the really influential people, and by _all_  right-thinking ones. We came back here yesterday evening. The accounts  from Paris are excellent too. How long are the good Joinvilles to  remain in the south, and where? By-the-by, dearest Uncle, have  you read the continuation of Consuelo,[33] called the \"Comtesse de  Rudolstadt\"? It is _dreadfully_ interesting.    The Knights of the Garter did _not_ wear the whole costume, but only  the mantle. Being on this topic, shall tell you that I intend giving  the Garter to Ernest, but pray do not mention it to E. or _any one_.    With Albert's affectionate love. Ever your devoted Niece and Child,    VICTORIA R.
