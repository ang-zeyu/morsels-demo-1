This process is rather a difficult one, as it requires an airtight case,  but the description herewith given may be entered into with as large a  case as the builder cares to construct.    Oak articles can be treated in a case made from a tin biscuit box, or  any other metal receptacle of good proportions, provided it is airtight.  The oak to be fumed is arranged in the box so the fumes will entirely  surround the piece; the article may be propped up with small sticks, or  suspended by a string. The chief point is to see that no part of the  wood is covered up and that all surfaces are exposed to the fumes. A  saucer of ammonia is placed in the bottom of the box, the lid or cover  closed, and all joints sealed up by pasting heavy brown paper over them.  Any leakage will be detected if the nose is placed near the tin and  farther application of the paper will stop the holes. A hole may be cut  in the cover and a piece of glass fitted in, taking care to have all the  edges closed. The process may be watched through the glass and the  article removed when the oak is fumed to the desired shade. Wood stained  in this manner should not be French polished or varnished, but waxed.    The process of waxing is simple: Cut some bees-wax into fine shreds and  place them in a small pot or jar. Pour in a little turpentine, and set  aside for half a day, giving it an occasional stir. The wax must be  thoroughly dissolved and then more turpentine added until the  preparation has the consistency of a thick cream. This can be applied to  the wood with a rag and afterward brushed up with a stiff brush.          HOW TO MAKE BLACK WAX      When putting a wax finish on oak or any open-grained wood, the wax will  often show white streaks in the pores of the wood. These streaks cannot  be removed by rubbing or brushing. Prepared black wax can be purchased,  but if you do not have any on hand, ordinary floor wax can be colored  black. Melt the floor wax in a can placed in a bucket of hot water. When  the wax has become liquid mix thoroughly into it a little drop black or  lampblack. Allow the wax to cool and harden. This wax will not streak,  but will give a smooth, glossy finish.          THE 40 STYLES OF CHAIRS      There are 40 distinct styles of chairs embracing the period from 3000  B.C. to 1900 A.D.--nearly 7,000 years. Of all the millions of chairs  made during the centuries, each one can be classified under one or more  of the 40 general styles shown in the chart. This chart was compiled by  the editor of Decorative Furniture. The Colonial does not appear on the  chart because it classifies under the Jacobean and other styles. A  condensed key to the chart follows:         $Egyptian.--3000 B.C. to 500 B.C.$ Seems to have been derived       largely from the Early Asian. It influenced Assyrian and Greek       decorations, and was used as a motif in some French Empire       decoration. Not used in its entirety except for lodge rooms, etc.         $Grecian.--700 B.C. to 200 B.C.$ Influenced by Egyptian and       Assyrian styles. It had a progressive growth through the Doric,       Ionic and Corinthian periods. It influenced the Roman style and the       Pompeian, and all the Renaissance styles, and all styles following       the Renaissance, and is still the most important factor in       decorations today.         $Roman.--750 B.C. to 450 A.D.$ Rome took her art entirely from       Greece, and the Roman is purely a Greek development. The Roman       style \"revived\" in the Renaissance, and in this way is still a       prominent factor in modern decoration.         $Pompeian.--100 B.C. to 79 A.D.$ Sometimes called the Grecian-Roman       style, which well describes its components. The style we know as       Greek was the Greek as used in public structures. The Pompeian is       our best idea of Greek domestic decoration. Pompeii was long       buried, but when rediscovered it promptly influenced all European       styles, including Louis XVI, and the various Georgian styles.         $Byzantine.--300 A.D. to 1450 A.D.$ The \"Eastern Roman\" style,       originating in the removal of the capital of the Roman Empire to       Constantinople (then called Byzantium). It is a combination of       Persian and Roman. It influenced the various Moorish, Sacracenic       and other Mohammedan styles.         $Gothic.--1100 to 1550.$ It had nothing to do with the Goths, but       was a local European outgrowth of the Romanesque. It spread all       over Europe, and reached its climax of development about 1550. It       was on the Gothic construction that the Northern European and       English Renaissance styles were grafted to form such styles as the       Elizabethan, etc.      [Illustration]         $Moorish.--700 to 1600.$ The various Mohammedan styles can all be       traced to the ancient Persian through the Byzantine. The Moorish or       Moresque was the form taken by the Mohammedans in Spain.         $Indian.--2000 B.C. to 1906 A.D.$ The East Indian style is almost       composite, as expected of one with a growth of nearly 4,000 years.       It has been influenced repeatedly by outside forces and various       religious invasions, and has, in turn, influenced other far Eastern       styles.         $Chinese.--3500 B.C. to 1906 A.D.$ Another of the ancient styles.       It had a continuous growth up to 230 B.C., since when it has not       changed much. It has influenced Western styles, as in the       Chippendale, Queen Anne, etc.         $Japanese.--1200 B.C. to 1906 A.D.$ A style probably springing       originally from China, but now absolutely distinct. It has       influenced recent art in Europe and America, especially the \"New       Art\" styles.         $Italian Gothic.--1100 to 1500.$ The Italian Gothic differs from       the European and English Gothic in clinging more closely to the       Romanesque-Byzantine originals.         $Tudor.--1485 to 1558.$ The earliest entry of the Renaissance into       England. An application of Renaissance to the Gothic foundations.       Its growth was into the Elizabethan.         $Italian Renaissance, Fifteenth Century.--1400 to 1500.$ The birth       century of the Renaissance. A seeking for revival of the old Roman       and Greek decorative and constructive forms.         $Italian Renaissance, Sixteenth Century.--1500 to 1600.$ A period       of greater elaboration of detail and more freedom from actual Greek       and Roman models.         $Italian Renaissance, Seventeenth Century.--1600 to 1700.$ The       period of great elaboration and beginning of reckless       ornamentation.         $Spanish Renaissance.--1500 to 1700.$ A variation of the       Renaissance spirit caused by the combination of three distinct       styles--the Renaissance as known in Italy, the Gothic and the       Moorish. In furniture the Spanish Renaissance is almost identical       with the Flemish, which it influenced.         $Dutch Renaissance.--1500 to 1700.$ A style influenced alternately       by the French and the Spanish. This style and the Flemish had a       strong influence on the English William and Mary and Queen Anne       styles, and especially on the Jacobean.         $German Renaissance.--1550 to 1700.$ A style introduced by Germans       who had gone to Italy to study. It was a heavy treatment of the       Renaissance spirit, and merged into the German Baroque about 1700.         $Francis I.--1515 to 1549.$ The introductory period when the       Italian Renaissance found foothold in France. It is almost purely       Italian, and was the forerunner of the Henri II.         $Henri II.--1549 to 1610.$ In this the French Renaissance became       differentiated from the Italian, assuming traits that were       specifically French and that were emphasized in the next period.         $Louis XIII.--1616 to 1643.$ A typically French style, in which but       few traces of its derivation from the Italian remained. It was       followed by the Louis XIV.         $Elizabethan.--1558 to 1603.$ A compound style containing traces of       the Gothic, much of the Tudor, some Dutch, Flemish and a little       Italian. Especially noted for its fine wood carving.         $Jacobean.--1603 to 1689.$ The English period immediately following       the Elizabethan, and in most respects quite similar. The Dutch       influence was, however, more prominent. The Cromwellian, which is       included in this period, was identical with it.         $William and Mary.--1689 to 1702.$ More Dutch influences. All       furniture lighter and better suited to domestic purposes.      [Illustration]           $Queen Anne.--1702 to 1714.$ Increasing Dutch influences. Jacobean       influence finally discarded. Chinese influence largely present.         $Louis XIV.--1643 to 1715.$ The greatest French style. An entirely       French creation, marked by elegance and dignity. Toward the end of       the period it softened into the early Rococo.         $Georgian.--1714 to 1820.$ A direct outgrowth of the Queen Anne,       tempered by the prevailing French styles. It includes Chippendale,       Hepplewhite and Sheraton, but these three great cabinetmakers were       sufficiently distinct from the average Georgian to be worthy       separate classification.         $Chippendale.--1754 to 1800.$ The greatest English cabinet style.       Based on the Queen Anne, but drawing largely from the Rococo,       Chinese and Gothic, he produced three distinct types, viz.: French       Chippendale, Chinese Chippendale and Gothic Chippendale. The last       is a negligible quantity.         $Louis XV.--1715 to 1774.$ The Rococo period. The result of the       efforts of French designers to enliven the Louis XIV, and to evolve       a new style out of one that had reached its logical climax.         $Hepplewhite.--1775 to 1800.$ Succeeded Chippendale as the popular       English cabinetmaker. By many he is considered his superior. His     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#8)"],[1,"of the words. The  lute idea dictates an arpeggiated accompaniment, whose harmonic beauty  and courage is beyond description and beyond the grasp of the mind at  the first hearing. The bravery of the climax follows the weird and  opiate harmonies of the middle part with tremendous effect. The song  is, in my fervent belief, a masterwork of absolute genius, one of the  very greatest lyrics in the world's music.      _Harvey Worthington Loomis._    [Illustration: HARVEY WORTHINGTON LOOMIS.]    [Illustration: Autograph of Harvey Worthington Loomis]    In the band of pupils that gathered to the standard of the invader,  Antonin Dvorak, when, in 1892, he came over here from Macedonia to  help us, some of the future's best composers will probably be found.    Of this band was Harvey Worthington Loomis, who won a three years'  scholarship in Doctor Dvorak's composition class at the National  Conservatory, by submitting an excellent, but rather uncharacteristic,  setting of Eichendorff's \"Fruehlingsnacht.\" Loomis evidently won  Doctor Dvorak's confidence, for among the tasks imposed on him was a  piano concerto to be built on the lines of so elaborate a model as  Rubinstein's in D minor. When Loomis' first sketches showed an  elaboration even beyond the complex pattern, Dvorak still advised him  to go on. To any one that knows the ways of harmony teachers this will  mean much.    Loomis (who was born in Brooklyn, February 5, 1865, and is now a  resident of New York) pursued studies in harmony and piano in a  desultory way until he entered Doctor Dvorak's class. For his musical  tastes he was indebted to the artistic atmosphere of his home.    Though Loomis has written something over five hundred compositions,  only a few works have been published, the most important of which are  \"Fairy Hill,\" a cantatilla for children, published in 1896 (it was  written on a commission that fortunately allowed him liberty for not a  little elaboration and individuality), \"Sandalphon,\" and a few songs  and piano pieces.    A field of his art that has won his especial interest is the use of  music as an atmosphere for dramatic expression. Of this sort are a  number of pantomimes, produced with much applause in New York by the  Academy of Dramatic Arts; and several musical backgrounds. The 27th of  April, 1896, a concert of his works was given by a number of  well-known artists.    These musical backgrounds are played in accompaniment to dramatic  recitations. Properly managed, the effect is most impressive. Feval's  poem, \"The Song of the Pear-tree,\" is a typically handled work. The  poem tells the story of a young French fellow, an orphan, who goes to  the wars as substitute for his friend Jean. After rising from rank to  rank by bravery, he returns to his home just as his sweetheart,  Perrine, enters the church to wed Jean. The girl had been his one  ambition, and now in his despair he reenlists and begs to be placed in  the thickest of danger. When he falls, they find on his breast a  withered spray from the pear-tree under which Perrine had first  plighted troth. On these simple lines the music builds up a drama.  From the opening shimmer and rustle of the garden, through the  Gregorian chant that solemnizes the drawing of the lots, and is  interrupted by the youth's start of joy at his own luck (an abrupt  _glissando_); through his sturdy resolve to go to war in his friend's  place, on through many battles to his death, all is on a high plane  that commands sympathy for the emotion, and enforces unbounded  admiration for the art. There is a brief hint of the Marseillaise  woven into the finely varied tapestry of martial music, and when the  lover comes trudging home, his joy, his sudden knowledge of Perrine's  faithlessness, and his overwhelming grief are all built over a long  organ-point of three clangorous bride-bells. The _leit-motif_ idea is  used with suggestive clearness throughout the work.    The background to Longfellow's \"Sandalphon\" is so fine an arras that  it gives the poet a splendor not usual to his bourgeois lays. The  music runs through so many phases of emotion, and approves itself so  original and exaltedly vivid in each that I put it well to the fore  of American compositions.    Hardly less large is the--Loomis calls it \"Musical Symbolism,\" for  Adelaide Ann Proctor's \"The Story of the Faithful Soul.\" Of the  greatest delicacy imaginable is the music (for piano, violin, and  voice) to William Sharp's \"Coming of the Prince.\" The \"Watteau  Pictures\" are poems of Verlaine's variously treated: one as a  head-piece to a wayward piano caprice, one to be recited during a  picturesque waltz, the last a song with mandolin effects in the  accompaniment.    [Music:        How, erect, at the outermost gates of the City      Celestial he waits,      With his feet on the ladder of light,      That, crowded with angels unnumbered,      By Jacob was seen as he slumbered      Alone in the desert at night?      The Angels of Wind and of Fire      Chant only one hymn, and expire      With the song's irresistible stress,      Expire in their rapture and wonder,      As harp-strings are broken asunder      By music they throb to express.      But serene in the rapturous throng,      Unmoved by the rush of the song,      With eyes unimpassioned and slow,      Among the dead angels, the deathless      Sandalphon stands listening, breathless,      To sounds that ascend from below,...    Copyright, 1896, by Edgar S. Werner.    A FRAGMENT OF \"SANDALPHON,\" BY H.W. LOOMIS.]    The pantomimes range from grave to gay, most of the librettos in this  difficult form being from the clever hand of Edwin Starr Belknap.  \"The Traitor Mandolin,\" \"In Old New Amsterdam,\" \"Put to the Test,\"  \"Blanc et Noir,\" \"The Enchanted Fountain,\" \"Her Revenge,\" \"Love and  Witchcraft\" are their names. The music is full of wit, a quality  Loomis possesses in unusual degree. The music mimics everything from  the busy feather-duster of the maid to her eavesdropping. Pouring  wine, clinking glasses, moving a chair, tearing up a letter, and a  rollicking wine-song in pantomime are all hinted with the drollest and  most graphic programmism imaginable.    Loomis has also written two burlesque operas, \"The Maid of Athens\" and  \"The Burglar's Bride,\" the libretto of the latter by his brother,  Charles Battell Loomis, the well-known humorist. This latter contains  some skilful parody on old fogyism.    In the Violin Sonata the piano, while granting precedence to the  violin, approaches almost to the dignity of a duet. The finale is  captivating and brilliant, and develops some big climaxes. The work as  a whole is really superb, and ought to be much played. There are,  besides, a \"Lyric Finale\" to a sonata not yet written, and several  songs for violin, voice, and piano.    A suite for four hands, \"In Summer Fields,\" contains some happy  manifestations of ability, such as \"A June Roundelay,\" \"The Dryad's  Grove,\" and, especially, a humoresque \"Junketing,\" which is surely  destined to become a classic. From some of his pantomimes Loomis has  made excerpts, and remade them with new elaboration for two pianos,  under the name of \"Exotics.\" These are full of variety and of actual  novelty, now of startling discord, now of revelatory beauty. A  so-called \"Norland Epic,\" freely constructed on the sonata formula, is  one of Loomis' most brilliant and personal achievements.    Loomis has an especial aptitude for writing artistic ballet-music, and  for composing in the tone of different nationalities, particularly the  Spanish. His pantomimes contain many irresistible dances, one of them  including a Chinese dance alternating 4-4 with 3-4 time. His  strikingly fleet \"Harlequin\" has been published.    The gift of adding art to catchiness is a great one. This Loomis  seems to have to an unusual degree, as is evidenced by the dances in  his pantomimes and his series of six pieces \"In Ballet Costume,\" all  of them rich with the finest art along with a Strauss-like  spontaneity. These include \"L'Amazone,\" \"Pirouette,\" \"Un Pas Seul,\"  \"La Coryphee,\" \"The Odalisque,\" and \"The Magyar.\" One of his largest  works is a concert waltz, \"Mi-Careme,\" for two pianos, with elaborate  and extended introduction and coda.    A series of Genre Pictures contains such lusciousness of felicity as  \"At an Italian Festival,\" and there are a number of musical moments of  engaging charm, for instance, \"N'Importe Quoi,\" \"From a Conservatory  Program,\" \"A Tropical Night,\" a fascinating \"Valsette,\" a nameless  valse, and \"Another Scandal,\" which will prove a gilt-edged  speculation for some tardy publisher. It is brimming with the  delicious horror of excited gossipry. An example of how thoroughly  Loomis is invested with music--how he thinks in it--is his audacious  scherzo, \"The Town Crier,\" printed herewith.    In songs Loomis has been most prolific. He has set twenty-two of  Shakespeare's lyrics to music of the old English school, such as his  uproarious \"Let me the cannikin clink,\" and his dainty \"Tell me where  is fancy bred.\"    \"The Lark\" is written in the pentatonic scale, with accompaniment for  two flutes and a harp.    In the same vein are various songs of Herrick, a lyrist whose verse  is not usually congenial to the modern music-maker. Loomis' \"Epitaph  on a Virgin\" must be classed as a success. Indeed, it reaches positive  grandeur at its climax, wherein is woven the grim persistence of a  tolling bell. In the same style is a clever setting of Ben Jonson's  much music'd \"To Celia.\"    In German-tone are his veritably magnificent \"Herbstnacht\" and his \"At  Midnight,\" two studies after Franz. Heine's \"Des Waldes Kapellmeister\"  has been made into a most hilarious humoresque.    \"Bergerie\" is a dozen of Norman Gale's lyrics. \"Andalusia\" is a  flamboyant duet.    In Scotch songs there is a positive embarrassment of riches, Loomis'  fancies finding especial food and freedom in this school. I"]]]
