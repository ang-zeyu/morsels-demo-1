(#8)"],[1," a hill, paused when we had gained the summit,  partly to give a last look at the city, but more to rest my companion,  who declared that his legs would never get straight again from the heavy  burden which had bent them down, and that the rope with which the box  was tied was positively cutting his head in two.    I reclined upon a grassy bank, and nibbled a few blades while deep in  thought; but my valet, \"Snub,\" made a more substantial use of his time;  for, squatting himself down on his own hat, with his legs under him, to  my horror he pulled out a half-devoured bone, which he began to gnaw  with much appetite. I did not think this very becoming conduct in the  valet of a genteel Pussy; but as it was not the time to find fault,  I allowed him to pick his bone, and gazed long and tenderly upon that  city where I had been born and brought up, and which I was now leaving  for strange climes, and for the society of animals of whose very  language I was perhaps ignorant.    We now descended the hill, Snub carrying the box with a little more  comfort to himself, having placed his hat between the sharp cord and  his own broad, flat head; and on reaching the bottom we found that an  extensive wood lay before us, without any trace which seemed to show  there was a high-road through it. While stopping to consult what was the  best course to take, an animal came from behind a large tree, and with  many bows advanced towards us. His appearance startled me not a little,  for I could not at first make out who or what he was. I at length  discovered that he was a Fox, a tribe distantly related to the Dogs, but  so little liked by them that very few ever came into Caneville, and  those who did so, clipped their ears and trimmed their tails so as to  alter their look as much as possible to the animals among whom they  presented themselves. This Fox, on the contrary, wore all his native  luxuriance of fur, and, by the way he carried his great brush of a tail,  seemed not a little proud of it.    When he got within a few steps of us, he addressed me in broken  Caneville dialect, and offered his services to show me the way through  the wood. \"It was a short cut,\" he said, \"and would save me a good deal  of ground, which I should be obliged to go over if I went round the  forest.\"    Without paying attention to the nods or winks of Snub, which were  however so violent as almost to upset his load, I accepted his polite  offer with thanks, and bidding my valet, who walked very glumpily  behind, to keep close by, I followed my polite guide, who at once  entered a little path through two tall trees.    The shade grew thicker as we advanced, and I observed that the path  got not only narrower, but was in some places almost invisible. It was  evidently very little used, and unaccustomed as I had been of late to  the country, I did not feel quite comfortable in thus penetrating deeper  and deeper into the solitude; still I did not like to show any fear,  more particularly as I was rather annoyed at the conduct of Snub, who,  close behind me with the box upon his head, kept grumbling at its weight  one minute, and actually growling in an under-tone at our guide the  next.    The conduct of that guide did not exactly please me; for in his evident  wish to prevent my being alarmed, he kept chatter, chatter, chatter,  with all his might, and still went on, his sharp eyes here, there, and  everywhere at once, in a most disagreeable manner.    We at last reached an open space, covered over with grass, and here and  there strewn with immense masses of rock. The overhanging branches of  the trees were, however, so closely intertwined, that no ray of sun, and  very little light, could penetrate into it. Here I stopped short and  declared I would go no further; an exclamation which seemed to arouse  Mr. Fox's anger, for he came towards me with a threatening look that  alarmed me not a little. I stepped back to avoid him, when Snub--as if  by accident, although I felt sure the good dog knew perfectly well what  he was about--by a dexterous stumble pitched the box off his head right  against the Fox. It was only by the greatest agility that he avoided the  heavy weight falling on and crushing him; as it was, he could not get  his long tail out of the way in time, for the box came plump down upon  it and nailed him to the ground in the most effectual manner. In vain he  screamed and pulled; the weight was heavier than he could get rid of;  and the more he pulled and screamed, the greater was Snub's delight, who  capered round him, wagging his own tail with wonderful swiftness in the  intensity of his satisfaction.    After having kept him a prisoner for a good hour, and forced him to  confess that he had led us into the wood with the intention of robbing  us, and even worse, Snub cut a piece of cord from off the box and tying  it round Mr. Fox's neck, and then fast to the trunk again, lifted the  latter on to his head, and ordered the treacherous guide, under penalty  of instant death, to lead us back at once to the place we had started  from. The wounded beast was forced to obey; so taking his mutilated tail  in his paw, with a thousand apologies,--to which Snub made no other  reply than to bid him to \"look sharp\" (a very unnecessary piece of  advice, as his face could scarce have been sharper than it was), and to  which I made no answer at all,--he walked on in front of us, keeping at  as great a distance from his tormentor as the length of the cord would  allow him.    We reached, after some time, the place where we had entered the wood,  when Snub, advising our polite conductor to be more honest for the  future, undid the knot which bound him to the trunk and set him again  at liberty. The Fox no sooner found himself free, than, with a cry of  satisfaction, anger, and defeated wickedness, he darted back among the  trees, and was instantly out of sight.          LIFE ABROAD.      The first adventure that one meets with on entering the world is certain  to make a deeper impression on the memory than any of those which may  succeed it. Thus it was that I have a distinct recollection of our  meeting with Mr. Fox, described in the last Chapter, and all the minute  circumstances that attended the discovery of his treachery and his  punishment by Snub. But from that time, a confusion of objects and  events rushes into my brain when I attempt to think over the particulars  of my journey.    The beautiful pictures of Nature, which almost every turn on the road  presented to me, are however indelibly fixed in my memory, and I shall  never forget the loveliness of the sun rising from behind the grey  hills, and enriching the sober colours of the landscape with a tinge  of gold; or the splendid spectacle displayed from the summit of one of  those same hills at noonday, with a very world of beauties at my feet,  laid out in trees, and stream, and field, with a light breeze driving  the patches of cloud over the face of the hot sun, and shifting at every  moment the light and shade beneath; or, lovelier still, the calm repose  of evening, when that same sun had run his course and was sinking to his  rest amid the harmonious sounds of Nature, and surrounded by the glories  of piles and piles of golden and crimson clouds, which, as he sank lower  and lower down, gradually lost their splendour and faded almost  imperceptibly in colour, until all was grey, and the night-wind swept  over the landscape as if mourning at the day's departure! These things  cannot be forgotten while our memory exists at all, and the joy they  awoke in my breast at seeing them, was like that which I had felt when  my dead cousin used to sing some of her delightful songs,--it was all  music to me.    But the first sight of the sea was what filled me with wonder, delight,  and fear! The immense breadth of water,--at one time so calm as though  it were asleep; at another, moaning as if it grieved for the many brave  and good hearts it had engulfed; and on other occasions, fretting  against the rocks, or, when moved by some strong impulse, working itself  white with fury, and carrying all before it in its impetuous course. All  these various moods were matter to me of astonishment and awe, which no  familiarity could ever diminish; and I watched the waves roll in, and  throw shells or corks or pieces of smooth wood to my very feet, with the  same surprise after weeks of acquaintance, as I had done on the first  day of my beholding the ocean.    Our road had led through districts but little frequented by other  animals, and, with the exception of a stray fox or hare, we met scarcely  a single creature. We carefully avoided all intercourse with the former,  and the latter as carefully kept away from communication with ourselves;  for the sight of us appeared so to alarm the poor beasts, that they  would not even answer our questions, whether we were proceeding towards  the habitations of more civilized animals.    To tell the truth, I so thoroughly enjoyed this part of my journey, that  I felt little inclination to change it for the confinement and stiffness  of city life; and as I had no difficulty in procuring food or  lodging,--for mice and wild birds abounded, and any old tree gave me  shelter,--I could have been content to spend some months in this errant  mode of existence, and meditate in the half-solitude on the vanities of  animal life. But I reproved myself for my selfishness when I looked at  Snub. He, poor fellow, who had not been blessed with the same advantages  of education as myself, had little inclination to continue a course  which presented much to be endured and little to be enjoyed. The bold  bending of a bough of a tree, which I found so admirable, he considered  very inferior to the joint of some savoury bone; the wide expanse of  the waters was to him less charming than the confined limits of some  dish containing one of our favourite Caneville compounds.

But not a man had come in view, so far as  I could see, in the whole process.    The Boss explained to me that it was his idea that he, Wilma and I  should investigate the wreck. If Han ships should appear in the sky, we  would leap for the hillsides.    I suggested to him to have the men set up their long-guns trained on an  imaginary circle surrounding the wreck. He busied himself with this  after the three of us leaped down to the Han ship, serving as a target  himself, while he called on the men individually to aim their pieces and  lock them in position.    In the meantime Wilma and I climbed into the wreckage, but did not find  much. Practically all of the instruments and machinery had been twisted  out of all recognizable shape, or utterly destroyed by the ship's  disintegrator rays which apparently had continued to operate in the  midst of its warped remains for some moments after the crash.    It was unpleasant work searching the mangled bodies of the crew. But it  had to be done. The Han clothing, I observed, was quite different from  that of the Americans, and in many respects more like the garb to which  I had been accustomed in the earlier part of my life. It was made of  synthetic fabrics like silks, loose and comfortable trousers of knee  length, and sleeveless shirts.    No protection, except that against drafts, was needed, Wilma explained  to me, for the Han cities were entirely enclosed, with splendid  arrangements for ventilation and heating. These arrangements of course  were equally adequate in their airships. The Hans, indeed, had quite a  distaste for unshaded daylight, since their lighting apparatus diffused  a controlled amount of violet rays, making the unmodified sunlight  unnecessary for health, and undesirable for comfort. Since the Hans did  not have the secret of inertron, none of them wore anti-gravity belts.  Yet in spite of the fact that they had to bear their own full weights at  all times, they were physically far inferior to the Americans, for they  lived lives of degenerative physical inertia, having machinery of every  description for the performance of all labor, and convenient conveyances  for any movement of more than a few steps.    Even from the twisted wreckage of this ship I could see that seats,  chairs and couches played an extremely important part in their scheme of  existence.    But none of the bodies were overweight. They seemed to have been the  bodies of men in good health, but muscularly much underdeveloped. Wilma  explained to me that they had mastered the science of gland control, and  of course dietetics, to the point where men and women among them not  uncommonly reached the age of a hundred years with arteries and general  health in splendid condition.    I did not have time to study the ship and its contents as carefully as I  would have liked, however. Time pressed, and it was our business to  discover some clue to the deadly accuracy with which the ship had  spotted the Wyoming Works.    The Boss had hardly finished his arrangements for the ring barrage, when  one of the scouts on an eminence to the north, announced the approach of  seven Han ships, spread out in a great semi-circle.    Hart leaped for the hillside, calling to us to do likewise, but Wilma  and I had raised the flaps of our helmets and switched off our  \"speakers\" for conversation between ourselves, and by the time we  discovered what had happened, the ships were clearly visible, so fast  were they approaching.    \"Jump!\" we heard the Boss order, \"Deering to the north. Rogers to the  east.\"    But Wilma looked at me meaningly and pointed to where the twisted plates  of the ship, projecting from the ground, offered a shelter.    \"Too late, Boss,\" she said. \"They'd see us. Besides I think there's  something here we ought to look at. It's probably their magnetic graph.\"    \"You're signing your death warrant,\" Hart warned.    \"We'll risk it,\" said Wilma and I together.    \"Good for you,\" replied the Boss. \"Take command then, Rogers, for the  present. Do you all know his voice, boys?\"    A chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some fast  thinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of metal.    \"Wilma, hunt for that record,\" I said, knowing that by the simple  process of talking I could keep the entire command continuously informed  as to the situation. \"On the hillsides, keep your guns trained on the  circles and stand by. On the hilltops, how many of you are there? Speak  in rotation from Bald Knob around to the east, north, west.\"    In turn the men called their names. There were twenty of them.    I assigned them by name to cover the various Han ships, numbering the  latter from left to right.    \"Train your rockets on their repellor rays about three-quarters of the  way up, between ships and ground. Aim is more important than elevation.  Follow those rays with your aim continuously. Shoot when I tell you, not  before. Deering has the record. The Hans probably have not seen us, or  at least think there are but two of us in the valley, since they're  settling without opening up disintegrators. Any opinions?\"    My ear discs remained silent.    \"Deering and I remain here until they land and debark. Stand by and keep  alert.\"    Rapidly and easily the largest of the Han ships settled to the earth.  Three scouted sharply to the south, rising to a higher level. The others  floated motionless about a thousand feet above.    Peeping through a small fissure between two plates, I saw the vast hulk  of the ship come to rest full on the line of our prospective ring  barrage. A door clanged open a couple of feet from the ground, and one  by one the crew emerged.          CHAPTER VI    The \"Wyoming Massacre\"      \"They're coming out of the ship.\" I spoke quietly, with my hand over  my mouth, for fear they might hear me. \"One--two--three--four,  five--six--seven--eight--nine. That seems to be all. Who knows how  many men a ship like that is likely to carry?\"    \"About ten, if there are no passengers,\" replied one of my men, probably  one of those on the hillside.    \"How are they armed?\" I asked.    \"Just knives,\" came the reply. \"They never permit hand-rays on the  ships. Afraid of accidents. Have a ruling against it.\"    \"Leave them to us then,\" I said, for I had a hastily formed plan in my  mind. \"You, on the hillsides, take the ships above. Abandon the ring  target. Divide up in training on those repellor rays. You, on the  hilltops, all train on the repellors of the ships to the south. Shoot at  the word, but not before.    \"Wilma, crawl over to your left where you can make a straight leap for  the door in that ship. These men are all walking around the wreck in a  bunch. When they're on the far side, I'll give the word and you leap  through that door in one bound. I'll follow. Maybe we won't be seen.  We'll overpower the guard inside, but don't shoot. We may escape being  seen by both this crew and ships above. They can't see over this wreck.\"    It was so easy that it seemed too good to be true. The Hans who had  emerged from the ship walked round the wreckage lazily, talking in  guttural tones, keenly interested in the wreck, but quite unsuspicious.    At last they were on the far side. In a moment they would be picking  their way into the wreck.    \"Wilma, leap!\" I almost whispered the order.    The distance between Wilma's hiding place and the door in the side of  the Han ship was not more than fifteen feet. She was already crouched  with her feet braced against a metal beam. Taking the lift of that  wonderful inertron belt into her calculation, she dove headforemost,  like a green projectile, through the door. I followed in a split second,  more clumsily, but no less speedily, bruising my shoulder painfully, as  I ricocheted from the edge of the opening and brought up sliding against  the unconscious girl; for she evidently had hit her head against the  partition within the ship into which she had crashed.    We had made some noise within the ship. Shuffling footsteps were  approaching down a well lit gangway.    \"Any signs we have been observed?\" I asked my men on the hillsides.    \"Not yet,\" I heard the Boss reply. \"Ships overhead still standing. No  beams have been broken out. Men on ground absorbed in wreck. Most of  them have crawled into it out of sight.\"    \"Good,\" I said quickly. \"Deering hit her head. Knocked out. One or more  members of the crew approaching. We're not discovered yet. I'll take  care of them. Stand a bit longer, but be ready.\"    I think my last words must have been heard by the man who was  approaching, for he stopped suddenly.    I crouched at the far side of the compartment, motionless. I would not  draw my sword if there were only one of them. He would be a weakling, I  figured, and I should easily overcome him with my bare hands.    Apparently reassured at the absence of any further sound, a man came  around a sort of bulkhead--and I leaped.    I swung my legs up in front of me as I did so, catching him full in the  stomach and knocked him cold.    I ran forward along the keel gangway, searching for the control room. I  found it well up in the nose of the ship. And it was deserted. What  could I do to jam the controls of the ships that would not register on  the recording instruments of the other ships? I gazed at the mass of  controls. Levers and wheels galore. In the center of the compartment, on  a massively braced universal joint mounting, was what I took for the  repellor generator. A dial on it glowed and a faint hum came from within  its shielding metallic case. But I had no time to study it.    Above all else, I was afraid that some automatic telephone apparatus  existed in the room, through which I might be heard on the other ships.  The risk of trying to jam the controls was too great. I abandoned the  idea and withdrew softly. I would have to take a chance that there was  no"]]]
