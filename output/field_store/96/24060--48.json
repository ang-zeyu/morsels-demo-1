All of  these give him an exquisite pleasure that he will be unable to  analyze, even if he were inclined to do so.    In his case, as in the case of the young woman, there has been  absolutely no conscious sexual stimulation; in the case of neither  individual has there been a thought of sex as such or of their sexual  apparatus, yet without a shadow of doubt, the sexual organs of both  individuals have been more or less active during this period--they  have been subject to sub-conscious sexual stimulation.    In the case of the male, his testes have been awakened into an  activity of probably considerably less degree than in the case of  conscious sexual stimulation, and during this activity of the gland a  certain amount of the secretion has been formed.    The most natural question at this point is--What becomes of this  secretion? It is not likely that any great number of spermatozoa are  released, those that are probably make their way along the vasa  deferentia to the ampullae. The liquid secretion of the testes probably  does not leave the testes but is reabsorbed. While there are many  features of this mysterious influence of the testes which have never  yet been cleared up, this seems certain, that the testes elaborate  what may be called an internal secretion, and that the elaboration of  this internal secretion is influenced by such stimulation as has just  been described above, under the head of sub-conscious sexual  stimulation.    An _internal secretion_ is a secretion formed by a gland, to be poured  into the blood or lymph system, while an _external secretion_ is  poured out through ducts to the exterior. The thyroid and adrenal  glands form internal secretions only, which secretions, poured into  the blood and lymph, profoundly affect the nutrition of the body. The  salivary glands and gastric glands form external secretions only;  which, when poured upon the food, digest it. The liver, pancreas and  testes form both external and internal secretions. The external  secretion of the testes is that which is poured out in a sexual  emission, as described above; the internal secretion of the testes  consists of substances formed by the testes of sexually mature  individuals, which substances, poured into the blood, profoundly  affect the development of the individual and his whole physical and  psychical character.      VIRILITY.    The best example that can be cited of the effect of this internal  secretion is the male of the horse kind.    Most young men have seen either at horse shows or upon farms or  ranches pedigreed stallions. No person can see one of these splendid  animals without admiring, if not actually standing in awe of his  inimitable physical force, beauty of form and grace and power of  action. He is a physical ideal of the horse kind. What is the source  of his strength and beauty?    The physical features that one notes peculiar to the stallion are,  first, the great breadth and depth of chest, great mass of shoulder  and hip muscles, and the high arched neck, fiery eye and luxuriant  mane and tail. Second, the functional features next noticeable are  the greater alertness and evident physical exuberance as manifested  especially in the gait and the frequent whinnying. The thoughtful  observer at the horse show or on the ranch cannot but compare these  animals with the gelding.    Two colts on the ranch may be full brothers,--from the same pedigreed  stallion and the same pedigreed dam. At the age of two years these two  young horses may be as alike as two peas in a pod. One of these  promising young animals is chosen, because of some commendable  peculiarity of temperament or action, to remain unmutilated, as a  procreator of his kind upon the ranch. The other is subjected to the  veterinarian's knife and ecraseur and deprived of the testes,--the  male sexual glands. From the day of this operation these two animals  (in every respect alike, except that one is unmutilated while the  other is deprived of the glands mentioned above) develop along  radically different lines. The stallion develops during his third year  into the noble animal described above. This third year is his period  of puberty and the changes which he undergoes physically and  psychically are closely parallel to the changes which the human  subject undergoes during his period of puberty. The gelding, on the  other hand, develops into an animal that is in every respect a neuter.  Physically this animal develops a body almost identical with that of  the female of the same species. Temperamentally the gelding is a  patient, plodding, beast of burden, and though under good grooming he  may show considerable life, while under the control of his driver, he  seldom shows any interest in other members of the horse family, either  male or female, and in the pasture or on the ranch his neutral sex  temperament is ever apparent. While he may contend mildly for a place  at the feeding trough, he never essays the defense of any weaker  members of the herd, and one stallion would put a hundred like him to  flight.    The thoughtful observer of this phenomenon cannot help wondering what  has made this radical difference in the development of these two  animals. The solution is not far to seek. From the beginning of  puberty to the beginning of senile decay, the stallion derives from  the testes what is referred to above as an internal secretion.    Physiologists have endeavored to determine exactly what substance  formed by the testes is reabsorbed into the lymph and blood. It may be  a substance called _spermin_, but whatever the substance is, the  physiologists agree that _the testes form some substance which is  absorbed by the blood and lymph, is carried to the brain and spinal  cord and there produces these profound effects indicated above_. So we  have discovered the source of the stallion's strength and beauty.    What is true of the horse is true of man. The young man at puberty  begins to receive from his testes the internal secretion which leads  to the development of his full manly powers. The sum total of the  qualities peculiar to manhood has been called VIRILITY. For want of a  better word, this term has been applied to the sum total of the male  qualities of any animal whatsoever, so that the male qualities of the  stallion are also compassed in the term virility.    The thoughtful and inquiring young man will naturally wish to know at  this point if this lesson from the beast of the field can be applied  in all its details to the human subject; if man, without any  artificial or unnatural means would develop a full and complete  virility; if like the horse, he can maintain a strict continence for  months or even years without suffering any abatement of virility and  of physical powers in general. The unequivocal answer of the medical  profession to these questions would be in the affirmative.    An exact parallel to the gelding referred to above can be found in the  eunuch of the Orient. If the human male is castrated before puberty he  develops into a being as different from a virile man as the gelding is  different from the stallion;--a being whose physique resembles in many  respects that of a woman, and whose temperament manifests qualities of  cringing servility and lack of initiative.    The external secretion of the testes differs from the internal  secretion in containing spermatozoa; it may be that there are other  differences. It is, however, generally believed that one or more of  the substances found in the external secretion appear in the internal  secretion. If this is true, it must be evident that excessive sexual  indulgence or masturbation can draw away from the system this precious  vital substance that is necessary to produce or maintain the virility.    It cannot be assumed that the condition of virility once attained will  necessarily always continue--it must be maintained. To be maintained,  this vital substance produced by the testes must be continuously  absorbed into the blood. When once the man or boy understands this, it  must be evident to him that he has, to a certain extent, the making or  marring of his own virility; that it is not simply an inexhaustible  endowment of nature; but, like such a natural resource as a forest or  a coal mine, may be exhausted and will be exhausted if not husbanded  carefully.    It is a well known fact in the medical profession that the ovaries of  the female exert upon her development an influence analogous to that  which the testes exert on the development of the male. For that  reason, a surgeon should, under no condition, remove both ovaries  (sexual glands) unless they are diseased in such a way as to  necessitate their complete removal in order to save the life of the  individual. If a woman of twenty-five were to suffer the loss of both  ovaries, she would go very early into a condition of senile decay. If  a female before puberty is deprived of both ovaries, it leads her to  develop masculine physical characteristics and her temperament is  wholly lacking in those characteristics which, summed up, might, for  the want of a better term, be called FEMININITY.          CHAPTER IV.    SEXUAL HYGIENE OF THE ADOLESCENT MALE.          SEXUAL HYGIENE OF THE ADOLESCENT MALE.      No rational or acceptable system of sexual hygiene for the human male  can be worked out without constant reference to the lower ranks of the  mammalian class and to primitive social conditions.    In our study of the anatomy and physiology of the sexual apparatus of  the human male, it must have become evident that man has many things  in common with other mammals, and that no adequate knowledge of man's  physical or psychical attributes can be obtained without a study of  similar phases of life among related animals.    All of the changes which Nature"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],[0,"Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#8)"],[1,"a man thought that he would try to eat the  monkey.    The monkey was playing his guitar. \"Lee, lee, lee, lee, lee lay, lee  lay, lee ray, lee ray.\" The man came close to him and said, \"Come  here, little monkey, and let me hear your music. I enjoy it very  much.\" All the time the man was coming closer and closer to the  monkey. Just as he was about to stretch out his hand and seize the  monkey, the monkey gave a sudden leap to the tree and hurried away to  the tree top.    After that every time the man heard the monkey play the guitar he  would come near and try to catch him. The monkey grew afraid of the  man, so afraid that he gave up playing his guitar at all. For a long,  long time he did not play upon it. One day he felt that he just _must_  have some music. He hid in a hole in the ground and there he played  upon his guitar. He did not think that the man would hear him, but the  man had very sharp ears. When he got through playing he started to  come out of the hole in the ground. There was the man waiting for him!  He crawled quickly back,--so far back that the man could not catch  him. The monkey waited and waited for the man to go away, but the man  did not go away.    After a while the man became thirsty and went to get a drink. He left  his little boy in his place to watch for the monkey. After the man had  gone away the monkey called out to the little boy, \"O, little boy, O,  little boy, don't you wish that you could see the monkey dance?\"    The little boy replied that he wished he could.    \"Just put your eyes down to the door of my little cave, and I'll let  you see the monkey dance, little boy,\" said the monkey.    The little boy put his eyes down close to the hole in the ground. No  sooner had he done so than the monkey threw dirt into the little boy's  eyes. When the little boy was rubbing his eyes to get the dirt out of  them the monkey made a sudden dash out of the cave and escaped to the  tree tops. When the man returned the little boy did not dare to tell  him that the monkey had escaped. The man waited and waited and waited  there by the hole in the ground. At last he became tired of waiting  and went away.    After that the man tried harder than ever to catch the monkey. If he  had not had the good luck to catch the monkey napping one day there is  no knowing when he would have got his hands upon him. One day,  however, he caught the monkey napping. He shut him up in a box and  carried him home to the children for supper.    The man put a big dish full of water over the fire ready to cook the  monkey. Then he went away to collect more fuel for the fire. The  monkey and his guitar were shut up in the box, and there, inside the  box, the monkey played on his guitar. \"Lee, lee, lee, lee, lee lay,  lee lay, lee ray, lee ray.\" The children came crowding close to the  box.    \"O, children, O, children,\" said the monkey, \"don't you wish that you  could see the monkey dance?\"    The children replied that they wished they could.    \"This box is so small that there is not room enough for me to dance  here,\" said the monkey. \"Just let me out and I'll show you how well I  can dance.\"    The children opened the box and let the monkey out into the room. The  monkey played on his guitar, \"Lee, lee, lee, lee, lee lay, lee lay,  lee ray, lee ray,\" and he danced about the room. Then he said, \"O,  children! O, children! You have nothing at all cooking in that pot  over the fire. Let us put something into the pot to cook.\"    The children thought that it would not be polite to tell the monkey  what the pot of water was waiting for, so they let the monkey fill  the pot as he liked. He put into it some little dry sticks and an  empty cocoanut shell. Then he said, \"O, children, O, children, I  cannot dance any more. It is so hot here in this room.\"    The children begged him to dance some more.    \"If you will open the door a little bit so that I can have more air to  breathe I'll show you a new dance,\" said the monkey.    The children opened the door. The monkey danced over to the door and  out of the door away to the tree top. That was the last they ever saw  of him. He moved to another part of the country after that experience.    When the man came home with fuel for the fire the children did not  dare to tell him that the monkey had escaped. They let him think that  the sticks and the cocoanut shell in the pot was the monkey. He built  a big roaring fire under the pot and soon it was boiling merrily.  After the pot had boiled a while he called the children to come to  supper with him. The children let him taste first. He fished a hard  stick out of the pot and bit into it. \"This is not the monkey's leg.  It is just a dry stick,\" he said, as he made a wry face. Then he  fished the empty cocoanut shell out of the pot. \"That is not the  monkey's head,\" he said as he tasted it, \"That is just an empty  cocoanut shell.\" He couldn't find a single trace of the monkey in that  monkey stew. He never wished to make a monkey stew again.          XIV    Why the Monkey Still Has    a Tail      Once upon a time the monkey and the rabbit made a contract. The monkey  was to kill all the butterflies and the rabbit was to kill all the  snakes.    One day the rabbit was taking a nap when the monkey passed that way.  The monkey thought that he would play a trick on the rabbit so he  pulled the rabbit's ears, pretending that he thought they were  butterflies. The rabbit awoke very angry at the monkey and he plotted  how he might revenge himself on the monkey.    The rabbit and the armadillo are very good friends. The armadillo is  very, very strong, you know, so it was he whom the rabbit asked to  help him.    One day the rabbit caught the monkey napping. He had watched and  waited a long, long time to catch the monkey napping, but at last he  succeeded. Even the monkey sometimes takes a nap. The rabbit called  the armadillo at once and together they rolled a big stone upon the  monkey's tail. The monkey pulled so hard to get his tail out from  under the stone that it broke off. The cat, who at that time had no  tail of her own, spied the tail and ran away with it. The monkey was  very angry at the rabbit. \"O, we thought it was just a snake lying  there,\" said the rabbit. \"When you pulled my ears, you know, you  thought they were butterflies.\"    That did not help the monkey to feel any better. How was he to live  without his tail! How could he climb without it! He simply had to have  it back so he at once set out to find the cat.    At last he found the cat and said to her, \"O, kind cat, please give me  back my tail.\"    \"I will give it to you,\" replied the cat, \"if you will get me some  milk.\"    \"Where shall I get the milk?\" asked the monkey.    \"Go ask the cow for some,\" replied the cat.    The monkey went to the cow and said, \"O, kind cow, please give me some  milk that I may give the milk to the cat so that the cat will give  back my tail to me.\"    \"I will give you the milk,\" replied the cow, \"if you will get me some  grass.\"    \"Where shall I get the grass?\" asked the monkey.    \"Go ask the farmer,\" responded the cow.    The monkey went to the farmer and said, \"O, kind farmer, please give  me some grass that I may give the grass to the cow so that the cow  will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to the cat so that  the cat will give back my tail to me.\"    The farmer said, \"I will give you some grass if you will give me some  rain.\"    \"Where shall I get the rain?\" asked the monkey.    \"Go ask the clouds,\" responded the farmer.    The monkey went to the clouds and said, \"O, kind clouds, please send  me down some rain that I may give the rain to the farmer so that the  farmer will give me some grass so that I may give the grass to the cow  so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to  the cat so that the cat will give me back my tail.\"    \"I will give you some rain,\" replied the clouds, \"if you will get me  some fog.\"    \"Where shall I get the fog?\" asked the monkey.    \"Go ask the rivers,\" replied the clouds.    The monkey went to the river and said, \"O, kind river, please give me  a fog that I may give the fog to the clouds so that the clouds will  give some rain so that I may give the rain to the farmer so that the  farmer will give me some grass so that I may give the grass to the cow  so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to  the cat so that the cat will give me back my tail.\"    \"I will give you a fog,\" replied the river, \"if you will find a new  spring to feed me.\"    \"Where shall I find a spring?\" asked the monkey.    \"Go search for one among the rocks upon the hillside,\" replied the  river.    Then the monkey climbed up the steep hill and searched and searched  among the rocks until at last he found a little spring to feed the  river. He brought the spring to the river and the river gave him a  fog. He took the fog to the clouds and the clouds gave him rain. He  took the rain to the farmer and the farmer gave him grass. He took the  grass to the cow and the cow gave him milk. He took the milk to the  cat and the cat gave him back his tail. The monkey was so glad to have  his tail again that he danced and danced with glee. Ever since that  time the monkey has been very careful to guard his tail. He still has  one and he is still happy because of it.          XV    How Black Became White      One often hears the saying that one cannot make black white or white  black. I said something about it once upon a time to my Brazilian  _ama_ and she stared at me in surprise. \"O, yes, one can,\" she said.  \"It happened once and no one can ever tell but that it may happen  again. Perhaps the _Senhora_ has not heard the story?\" I begged her to  tell me the story and this is the tale:    Once upon a time there was a little old woman who lived all alone with  her little black son who was just as black as black can be. The little  old woman had not always"]]]
