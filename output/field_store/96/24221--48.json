'What do you say, my dear angel?' said Gretry,       pressing her to his heart. 'Nothing, nothing! I was playing       with death; why do you not let the children play?'         \"Gretry thought that a southern journey would be a beneficial       change; he took his daughter to Lyons, where she had friends.       For a short time she returned to her gay and careless manner.       Gretry went to work again, and finished _Guillaume Tell_. He       went every morning, in search of inspiration, to the chamber of       his daughter, who said to him one day, on awaking: 'Your music       has always the odor of a poem; this will have that of wild       thyme.'         \"Towards autumn, she again lost her natural gayety. Gretry took       his wife aside--'You see your daughter,' said he to her. At       this single word, an icy shudder seized both. They shed a       torrent of tears. The same day they thought of returning to       Paris. 'So we are to go back to Paris', said Antoinette; 'it is       well. I shall rejoin there those whom I love.' She spoke of her       sisters. After reaching Paris, the poor, fated girl concealed       all the ravages of death with care; her heart was sad, but her       lips were smiling. She wished to conceal the truth from her       father to the end. One day, while she was weeping and hiding       her tears, she said to him with an air of gayety: 'You know       that I am going to the ball to-morrow, and I want to appear       well-dressed there. I want a pearl necklace, and shall look for       it when I wake up to-morrow morning.'         \"She went to the ball. As she set out with her mother, Rouget       Delisle, a musician more celebrated at that time than Gretry,       said rapturously: 'Ah, Gretry, you are a happy man! What a       charming girl! what sweetness and grace!' 'Yes,' said Gretry,       in a whisper, 'she is beautiful and still more amiable; she is       going to the ball, but in a few weeks we shall follow her       together to the cemetery!' 'What a horrible idea! You are       losing your senses!' 'Would I were not losing my heart! I had       three daughters; she is the only left to me, but already I must       weep for her!'         \"A few days after this ball, she took to her bed, and fell into       a sad but beautiful delirium. She had found her sisters again       in this world; she walked with them hand in hand; she waltzed       in the same saloon; she danced in the same quadrille; she took       them to the play: all the while recounting to them her       imaginary loves. What a picture for Gretry! 'She had,' he says       in his _Memoirs_, some serene moments before death.--She took       my hand, and that of her mother, and with a sweet smile, 'I see       well,' she murmured, 'that we must bear our destiny; I do not       fear death; but what is to become of you two?' She was propped       up by her pillow while she spoke with us for the last time. She       was laid back, then closed her beautiful eyes, and went to join       her sisters!         \"Gretry is very eloquent in his grief. There Is in this part of       his Memoirs a cry which came from his heart, and wrings our       own. 'Oh, my friends,' he exclaims, throwing down the pen, 'a       tear, a tear upon the beloved tomb of my three lovely flowers,       predestined to die, like those of the good Italian monk.'\"          A MODEL TRAVELLER.      One of the most readable of living travellers is certainly our own  BAYARD TAYLOR, who is now somewhere in the interior of the African  continent, and whose letters in the _Tribune_ are every where perused  with the greatest satisfaction. Worthy to be named along with him is the  German, FREDERICK GERSTAeCKER, whose adventures form one of the most  interesting features in that cyclopediac journal, the Augsburg  _Allgemeine Zeitung_. It is now some two years since Gerstaecker set out  upon his present explorations. The backwoods of the United States  furnished a broad field for his love of a wild and changeful life, and  gave full play to his passion for the study of human character in all  its out of the way phases. His accounts of these regions were touched  with the most vivid colors; not Cooper nor Irving has more truly  reproduced the grand and savage features of American scenery, or the  reckless generous daring of the rude backwoodsman, than Gerstaecker,  writing, from some chance hut, his nocturnal landing place on the shore  of some mighty river in Nebraska or Arkansas. Next we hear of him in  South America, and then in California, passing a winter among the miners  of the remotest districts, digging gold, hunting, trafficking, fighting  in case of need like the rest, and every where sending home the most  lively daguerreotypes of the country, the people, and his own adventures  among them. Finally, having seen all that was in California, he takes  passage for the Sandwich Islands, where he remains long enough to  exhaust all the romance remaining, and to gather every sort of useful  information. From there he set out upon an indefinite voyage on board of  a whaler going to the Southern seas in search of oil. Chance, however,  brings him up at Australia: and he at once sets about travelling through  the settled portions of the Continent, taking the luck of the day every  where with exhaustless good humour, and never getting low spirited, no  matter how untoward the mishaps encountered. Less elegant and poetic  than Taylor, he dashes ahead with a more perfect indifference to  consequences, and a more utter reliance on coming out all right in the  end. In his last letter, he gives an account of a voyage in a canoe from  Albury, on the upper waters of Hume River, down to Melbourne, at its  mouth. He had got out of funds, and was thus obliged to set out on this  route contrary to the advice of the settlers at Albury, who represented  to him that the danger of being killed and eaten by the natives along  shore, who had never come in contact with whites, was inevitable, and  that they would be sure to destroy him before he reached his  destination. This was, however, only an additional inducement to the  trip. While making preparations for it, he fell in with a young  fellow-countryman in the settlement, who desired to make the same  journey, and who was willing to encounter the risks of the river rather  than pay the heavy expenses of the trip by land. They accordingly  proceeded to dig a canoe out of a caoutchouc tree, furnished themselves  with paddles, a frying-pan, blankets, some crackers, sugar, salt, tea,  and powder, and embarked. The river was shallow, and full of windings  and sandbanks, sunken caoutchouc trees had planted the stream with  frequent snags, and often heavy masses of fallen timber, still adhering  to the earth at its roots, and thus preserving its vitality, and  flourishing with all the luxuriance of a primitive tropical forest,  covered the only part of the channel where the water was deep enough to  admit of the passage of their canoe. Thus they toiled on day by day,  often getting out into the water to help their vessel over shallows, or  to pick up the ducks that Gerstaecker shot, which furnished the only meat  for their daily meals. Cloudy or fair, cold or warm, rain or sunshine,  found Gerstaecker still in the same flow of spirits, and the notes of his  daily experiences show him bearing ill-luck almost as gaily as good.  After they had gone some 400 miles, however, their journey by the river  came to a sudden end by the oversetting of their canoe, and the loss of  almost all their equipments. Gerstaecker saved his rifle and the  ammunition that was upon his person; but the remaining powder was  spoiled, and the provisions and part of the blankets and clothing were  carried away by the current. The canoe sunk, but by holding upon the  rope as they jumped out upon the overhanging trunks of trees, the  voyagers succeeded in dragging it up again, and freeing it from water.  Then one of them dived to the bottom, and managed to bring up the  frying-pan and tea-canister. They also recovered part of their blankets,  and then, with the frying-pan for their sole paddle, renewed their  voyage till they found a good camping-place, where they built a roaring  fire to dry themselves, and finally discovered that in the operations of  the day each had utterly ruined his shoes, so that they were afterwards  forced to go barefoot. In this way they continued for some days,  paddling with their frying-pan, and going ashore to get a duck  occasionally shot by Gerstaecker. This was often exceedingly painful,  from the stubble of the grass along the banks, burnt over by fires  accidentally set by the natives. Luckily, through the whole they did not  come in contact with the savages at all. At last they reached a  settlement, where they swapped their canoe for a couple pair of shoes,  and started on foot for the rest of the way. Gerstaecker had for some  time desired to get rid of his companion, who was wilful, and by no  means a helper in their difficulties. They now came to Woolshed, a place  180 miles distant from Melbourne, whence there were two roads to their  destination; the one was perfectly free from the savages, the other was  dangerous. Here Gerstaecker separated from his companion, giving him the  safe road, and, with his rifle on his arm and his knapsack slung upon  his shoulders, struck off alone into the forest-path light-hearted as a  boy, and sure, whatever might happen, of enjoying a fresher and  healthier excitement in that journey through the woods of Australia than  the dwellers in crowded cities enjoy in all their lives.
