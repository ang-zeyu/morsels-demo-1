Yet they have a speech which enables them to exchange, by  means of intonations not yet noted by man, ideas that are rudimentary,  no doubt, but which are such as may be conceived by creatures within  their sphere of action and feeling. Less stupid than we are, animals  succeed in understanding a few words of our idiom, but not enough to  enable them to converse with us. Besides, as the words they do learn  refer solely to what we exact of them, the conversation would be brief.  But that animals speak cannot be doubted by any one who has lived in any  degree of intimacy with dogs, cats, horses, or other creatures of that  sort.    For instance, Jane was naturally intrepid; she never refused, and  nothing frightened her, but after a few months of cohabitation with  Blanche her character changed and she manifested at times sudden and  inexplicable fear. Her companion, much less brave, must have told her  ghost stories at night. Often, when going through the Bois de Boulogne  at dusk or after dark, Blanche would stop short or shy, as if a phantom,  invisible to me, had risen up before her. She trembled in every limb,  breathed hard, and broke out into sweat. If I attempted to urge her  ahead with the whip, she backed, and all Jane could do, strong as she  was, was insufficient to induce her to go on. One of us would have to  get down, cover her eyes with the hand and lead her until the vision had  vanished. Little by little Jane became subject to the same terror, the  reason of which, no doubt, Blanche told her once they were back in their  stable. I may as well confess that for my part, when I would be driving  down a dark road on which the moonlight produced alternations of light  and shadow, and Blanche suddenly became rooted to the spot as though a  spectre had sprung at her head, and refused to move,--she who was  usually so docile that Queen Mab's whip, made of a cricket's bone with a  spider's thread for a thong, was enough to start her into a gallop,--I  could not repress a slight shudder or refrain from peering into the  darkness rather anxiously, while at times the harmless trunks of ash or  birch trees would appear to me as spectral-looking as one of Goya's  \"Caprices.\"    I took great delight in driving these dear animals myself, and we soon  became very intimate. It was merely as a matter of form that I held the  reins, for the least click of the tongue was enough to direct them, to  turn them to the right or the left, to make them go faster, or to stop  them. They quickly learned all my habits and started of themselves for  the office, the printer's, the publishers', the Bois de Boulogne, and  the houses where I went to dinner on certain days of the week, and this  so accurately that they would have ended by compromising me, for they  would have revealed the places to which I paid the most mysterious  visits. If I happened to forget the time in the course of an interesting  or tender conversation they would remind me it was getting late by  neighing or pawing in front of the balcony.    Although I greatly enjoyed traversing the city in the phaeton drawn by  my two friends, I could not help at times thinking the north wind sharp  and the rain cold when the months came along which the Republican  calendar named so appropriately the months of mist, of frost, of rain,  of wind, of snow (brumaire, frimaire, pluviose, ventose, nivose), so I  purchased a small blue coupe, lined with white reps, which was likened  to the equipage of the famous dwarf of the day, a piece of impertinence  I did not mind. A brown coupe, lined with garnet, followed the blue one,  and was itself replaced by a dark-green coupe lined with dark blue, for  I actually did sport a coach--I, poor newspaper writer holding no  Government stock--for five or six years. And my ponies were none the  less fat and in good condition though they were fed on literature, had  substantives for oats, adjectives for hay, and adverbs for straw. But  alas! there came, no one knows very well why, the Revolution in  February; a great many paving-stones were picked up for patriotic  purposes, and Paris became rather unfit for carriage travel. I could of  course have escaladed the barricades with my agile steeds and my light  equipage, but it was only at the cook-shop that I could get credit, and  I could not possibly feed my horses on roast chicken. The horizon was  dark with heavy clouds, through which flashed red gleams. Money had  taken fright and gone into hiding; the _Presse_, on the staff of which I  was, had suspended publication, and I was glad enough to find a person  willing to buy my horses, harness, and carriages for a fourth of their  value. It was a bitter grief to me, and I would not venture to say that  no tears ran down my cheeks on to the manes of Jane and Blanche when  they were led away. Sometimes their new owner would drive past the  house; I always knew their quick, sharp trot at a distance, and always  the sudden way they would stop under my windows proved that they had not  forgotten the place where they had been so tenderly loved and so well  cared for, and a sigh would break responsive from me as I said to  myself: \"Poor Jane, poor Blanche! I wonder if they are happy.\"    And the loss of them is the one and only thing I felt sore over when I  lost my slender fortune.

And all the world knows that water boils at 80 deg.  (212 deg.). Now, boiling being only the evaporation of a liquid, or the  moment of its passing from the fluid to the aeriform state, it is  evident that, if we keep ether continually at the temperature of 33 deg.  (106.25 deg.), and under the common pressure of the atmosphere, we shall  have it always in an elastic aeriform state; and that the same thing  will happen with alkohol when above 67 deg. (182.75 deg.), and with  water when above 80 deg. (212 deg.); all which are perfectly conformable  to the following experiment[7].    I filled a large vessel ABCD (Plate VII. Fig. 16.) with water, at 35 deg.  (110.75 deg.), or 36 deg. (113 deg.); I suppose the vessel transparent,  that we may see what takes place in the experiment; and we can easily  hold the hands in water at that temperature without inconvenience. Into  it I plunged some narrow necked bottles F, G, which were filled with the  water, after which they were turned up, so as to rest on their mouths on  the bottom of the vessel. Having next put some ether into a very small  matrass, with its neck a b c, twice bent as in the Plate, I plunged this  matrass into the water, so as to have its neck inserted into the mouth  of one of the bottles F. Immediately upon feeling the effects of the  heat communicated to it by the water in the vessel ABCD it began to  boil; and the caloric entering into combination with it, changed it into  elastic aeriform fluid, with which I filled several bottles  successively, F, G, &c.    This is not the place to enter upon the examination of the nature and  properties of this aeriform fluid, which is extremely inflammable; but,  confining myself to the object at present in view, without anticipating  circumstances, which I am not to suppose the reader to know, I shall  only observe, that the ether, from this experiment, is almost only  capable of existing in the aeriform state in our world; for, if the  weight of our atmosphere was only equal to between 20 and 24 inches of  the barometer, instead of 28 inches, we should never be able to obtain  ether in the liquid state, at least in summer; and the formation of  ether would consequently be impossible upon mountains of a moderate  degree of elevation, as it would be converted into gas immediately upon  being produced, unless we employed recipients of extraordinary strength,  together with refrigeration and compression. And, lastly, the  temperature of the blood being nearly that at which ether passes from  the liquid to the aeriform state, it must evaporate in the primae viae,  and consequently it is very probable the medical properties of this  fluid depend chiefly upon its mechanical effect.    These experiments succeed better with nitrous ether, because it  evaporates in a lower temperature than sulphuric ether. It is more  difficult to obtain alkohol in the aeriform state; because, as it  requires 67 deg. (182.75 deg.) to reduce it to vapour, the water of the  bath must be almost boiling, and consequently it is impossible to plunge  the hands into it at that temperature.    It is evident that, if water were used in the foregoing experiment, it  would be changed into gas, when exposed to a temperature superior to  that at which it boils. Although thoroughly convinced of this, Mr de la  Place and myself judged it necessary to confirm it by the following  direct experiment. We filled a glass jar A, (Plate VII. Fig. 5.) with  mercury, and placed it with its mouth downwards in a dish B, likewise  filled with mercury, and having introduced about two gross of water into  the jar, which rose to the top of the mercury at CD; we then plunged the  whole apparatus into an iron boiler EFGH, full of boiling sea-water of  the temperature of 85 deg. (123.25 deg.), placed upon the furnace GHIK.  Immediately upon the water over the mercury attaining the temperature of  80 deg. (212 deg.), it began to boil; and, instead of only filling the  small space ACD, it was converted into an aeriform fluid, which filled  the whole jar; the mercury even descended below the surface of that in  the dish B; and the jar must have been overturned, if it had not been  very thick and heavy, and fixed to the dish by means of iron-wire.  Immediately after withdrawing the apparatus from the boiler, the vapour  in the jar began to condense, and the mercury rose to its former  station; but it returned again to the aeriform state a few seconds after  replacing the apparatus in the boiler.    We have thus a certain number of substances, which are convertible into  elastic aeriform fluids by degrees of temperature, not much superior to  that of our atmosphere. We shall afterwards find that there are several  others which undergo the same change in similar circumstances, such as  muriatic or marine acid, ammoniac or volatile alkali, the carbonic acid  or fixed air, the sulphurous acid, &c. All of these are permanently  elastic in or about the mean temperature of the atmosphere, and under  its common pressure.    All these facts, which could be easily multiplied if necessary, give me  full right to assume, as a general principle, that almost every body in  nature is susceptible of three several states of existence, solid,  liquid, and aeriform, and that these three states of existence depend  upon the quantity of caloric combined with the body. Henceforwards I  shall express these elastic aeriform fluids by the generic term _gas_;  and in each species of gas I shall distinguish between the caloric,  which in some measure serves the purpose of a solvent, and the  substance, which in combination with the caloric, forms the base of the  gas.    To these bases of the different gases, which are hitherto but little  known, we have been obliged to assign names; these I shall point out in  Chap. IV. of this work, when I have previously given an account of the  phenomena attendant upon the heating and cooling of bodies, and when I  have established precise ideas concerning the composition of our  atmosphere.    We have already shown, that the particles of every substance in nature  exist in a certain state of equilibrium, between that attraction which  tends to unite and keep the particles together, and the effects of the  caloric which tends to separate them. Hence the caloric not only  surrounds the particles of all bodies on every side, but fills up every  interval which the particles of bodies leave between each other. We may  form an idea of this, by supposing a vessel filled with small spherical  leaden bullets, into which a quantity of fine sand is poured, which,  insinuating into the intervals between the bullets, will fill up every  void. The balls, in this comparison, are to the sand which surrounds  them exactly in the same situation as the particles of bodies are with  respect to the caloric; with this difference only, that the balls are  supposed to touch each other, whereas the particles of bodies are not in  contact, being retained at a small distance from each other, by the  caloric.    If, instead of spherical balls, we substitute solid bodies of a  hexahedral, octohedral, or any other regular figure, the capacity of the  intervals between them will be lessened, and consequently will no longer  contain the same quantity of sand. The same thing takes place, with  respect to natural bodies; the intervals left between their particles  are not of equal capacity, but vary in consequence of the different  figures and magnitude of their particles, and of the distance at which  these particles are maintained, according to the existing proportion  between their inherent attraction, and the repulsive force exerted upon  them by the caloric.    In this manner we must understand the following expression, introduced  by the English philosophers, who have given us the first precise ideas  upon this subject; _the capacity of bodies for containing the matter of  heat_. As comparisons with sensible objects are of great use in  assisting us to form distinct notions of abstract ideas, we shall  endeavour to illustrate this, by instancing the phenomena which take  place between water and bodies which are wetted and penetrated by it,  with a few reflections.    If we immerge equal pieces of different kinds of wood, suppose cubes of  one foot each, into water, the fluid gradually insinuates itself into  their pores, and the pieces of wood are augmented both in weight and  magnitude: But each species of wood will imbibe a different quantity of  water; the lighter and more porous woods will admit a larger, the  compact and closer grained will admit of a lesser quantity; for the  proportional quantities of water imbibed by the pieces will depend upon  the nature of the constituent particles of the wood, and upon the  greater or lesser affinity subsisting between them and water. Very  resinous wood, for instance, though it may be at the same time very  porous, will admit but little water. We may therefore say, that the  different kinds of wood possess different capacities for receiving  water; we may even determine, by means of the augmentation of their  weights, what quantity of water they have actually absorbed; but, as we  are ignorant how much water they contained, previous to immersion, we  cannot determine the absolute quantity they contain, after being taken  out of the water.    The same circumstances undoubtedly take place, with bodies that are  immersed in caloric; taking into consideration, however, that water is  an incompressible fluid, whereas caloric is, on the contrary, endowed  with very great elasticity; or, in other words, the particles of caloric  have a great tendency to separate from each other, when forced by any  other power to approach; this difference must of necessity occasion  very considerable diversities in the results of experiments made upon  these two substances.    Having established these clear and simple propositions, it will be very  easy to"]]]
