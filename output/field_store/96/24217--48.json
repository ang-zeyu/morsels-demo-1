The species does not grow in nipa swamps, though immediately  back of them it will be found well established. Neither could one  expect to find it in localities where the cliffs come down abruptly  to the sea, permitting only the existence of vegetable life of the  lowest form.    Pandan is its usual name in the Philippines. In Zambales it is called  \"panglan\" or \"panglan babai.\" Another name is \"pangdan.\"    The stem is not very strong, and reaches a height of from 3 to 6  meters. It is generally supported by aerial roots. The leaves are of  medium thickness, on the average 1.35 m. long and 6 cm. wide. They are  provided with strong sharp spines about 5 mm. in length. These are  curved forward and are as much as one centimeter, or a little more,  apart. The spines on the under surface of the midrib are shorter  and farther apart, but bend in the same direction. The male flowers  form a spike and these are surrounded by very fragrant leaves called  spathes. The fruit is 20 cm. long, 18 cm. wide, and contains from 50  to 80 drupes, each about 5.5 cm. long and 2.5 to 3 cm. wide. The upper  half of the drupes are free but close together. There are small furrows  on the tops of the drupes, rather deep but not very distinct. When  ripe the fruit has a fine red color and the drupes fall from the head.    Pandanus tectorius is of considerable importance in nearly all parts  of the world where it grows, and it is devoted to most of the uses  already noted for pandans in general. In certain places, large  industries are founded on it. In India, the leaves are cut every  second year and made into large bags. Hats are produced from it in  the Pacific Islands, those from the Hawaiian group being especially  well known. It is probable that the imitation Panama hats of the  Loochoo Islands are also woven from a material (raffia) prepared from  the common pandan. In the Marshall Islands it is recorded that forty  varieties of this species have been evolved in the course of planting  and cultivation for industrial purposes.    From the information submitted with the specimens received in  the Bureau of Education, it is to be judged that the economic  importance of the common pandan in the Philippines is of but little  consequence. Though widely used, no large or even local industries  are based upon it. A scattering production of hats, mats, and bags is  reported in Abra, Union, Zambales, Mindoro, Bulacan, Rizal, Batangas,  Sorsogon, Iloilo, Antique, Oriental Negros, Cebu, Leyte, and Sorsogon  provinces. Near Badoc, Ilocos Norte, and along the Abra border the  Tinguian people make mats from an upland variety for local trade. In  Balayan, Batangas, the leaves are used for thatching. In Surigao they  are also made into baskets. In most processes the preparation of the  straw consists of cutting the leaves into strips and drying them. In  Zambales, however, it is reported that the leaves are flattened,  pressed, split, and rolled. In Mindoro, they are soaked in water and  dried in the sun before being cut into straw. It is probable that much  better material could be prepared from this pandan if such processes  as are used in the making of sabutan straw and straw from the Majayjay  pandan were followed.    Judging from the results obtained in other countries, it would seem  that if suckers of the common pandan were taken, in the districts in  which it grows, planted, and cultivated, varieties would result which  would be much better adapted for industrial purposes than the parent  stock. Indeed, it is probable that sabutan, the Philippine pandan  of greatest economic importance, is a variety which is the result  of generations of planting, still closely resembling P. tectorius  but differing from it in its leaves, which are thinner, longer,  of finer texture and of greater strength. It is possible also that  sarakat, the economic pandan of the Bangui Peninsula, Ilocos Norte,  is a variety of P. tectorius.          Varieties of the Common Pandan.      Sabutan.    Botanical.--It is a question among botanists whether the pandan known  as sabutan is a variety of the common sea-shore pandan (P. tectorius)  or whether it has sufficient distinctive characteristics to entitle  it to be considered as a separate species (P. sabotan). Botanists  have not as yet succeeded in securing a fruit of this pandan, which  could settle the question, and it is very doubtful whether the fruit  will ever be found. [12] Prof. Ugolino Martelli of Florence, Italy,  an authority on pandans, considers sabutan to be Pandanus tectorius  var. sinensis. This classification is for the present accepted, as  most evidence is in favor of such determination and in this paper  sabutan is therefore considered to be a variety of the common pandan,  the chief change in which, through generations of planting, has been  in the production of a leaf stronger, thinner, and of finer texture  than that of the parent stock.    The sabutan plant is never found growing wild, though after it has once  been started and rooted it will endure neglect and even abandonment. It  produces better and finer leaves, however, if it receives some care  and attention. In the towns of Tanay and Pililla, Rizal Province, and  in Mabitac, Laguna Province, and in all the towns along the lake shore  as far as Paete, the suckers of the plant are set out in small plots  of ground surrounding the houses of the people. These form patches  which in several years (depending mostly on soil conditions) yield  pandan leaves large and fine enough to be used in the manufacture of  hats and mats. The ideal location for sabutan is along the banks of  streams where it can get the benefit of the light shade of bamboo  or plants that happen to grow in the vicinity. Ordinarily, good  results are obtained by planting the suckers of sabutan in a loose  and moist, but well drained, soil. Plants are set out one meter apart  in each direction, as they spread considerably. They need some shade,  especially when young, but not the heavy shade of an abaca or banana  grove.    The plant grows to be from 2 to 4 meters high. The leaves are fine  in texture, about 2 meters long and as wide as 6 centimeters. Spines  occur on the margins and on the under surface of the midrib. The  male inflorescence procured from Tanay by the Bureau of Education  is similar in appearance to that of Pandanus tectorius and is about  27 centimeters long. At varying distances on the flower stalk are  leaves (bracts), thin and fine, from 10 to 24 centimeters long and  with fine spines on margins and midrib. The flowers have a pleasant,  though not very strong, odor.    Status of the sabutan mat industry.--As an industry, the weaving of  sabutan mats is confined to the towns of Tanay and Pililla, in the  Province of Rizal. The beginnings of this industry go back beyond  the memory of the oldest inhabitants or even of their parents. It  is probable that, as the people state, mat weaving has been carried  on ever since the towns were founded. Tanay is the older of the two  and it would seem (though reliable historical data of this kind are  difficult to obtain) that the town was the first to engage in sabutan  mat weaving and is probably the mother of all the sabutan industries  carried on around Laguna de Bay.    The present condition of the mat-weaving industry of these two towns,  however, is precarious; it appears to be gradually dying out. The  fabrication of sabutan hats has been introduced from Mabitac, Laguna  Province, into Pililla, with the result that the younger generation  is entirely engaged in making hats, and the relatively small number  of mats produced is being woven by the older women who have not cared  to learn the new art. As yet no hats are made in Tanay, but the work  is being taught in the schools and from conversation with people of  the town it is judged that they are becoming interested also.    The disappearance of the sabutan mat industry would be very  unfortunate, for the products are the finest samples of the mat  weaver's art produced in the Philippines. The mats are of fine straw;  the natural gray of sabutan is pleasing; the designs used are good; and  the colors are usually well combined. The favorite patterns consist of  heavy plaids with some of the stripes containing sub-patterns produced  by floating straws; the simplest ones have narrow border designs in  straight lines. The most expensive mats are decorated with embroidered  designs. The combination of colors in these is sometimes not pleasing  and the designs themselves are not of special merit. However, if  better ones are substituted, these mats should be excellent for a  foreign trade demanding expensive articles of this nature. Unlike  most Philippine mat industries, this one has not as yet been affected  by coal tar dyes, and only vegetable dyes, found locally in the  town or in the forests, are employed. The straw dyes very well and  as a consequence the colors produced are even throughout the mat;  nor have any of the shades that brilliant effect or \"off color\"  which is so distasteful in certain fibers. The colors obtained are  only fairly fast in the light, however, and it is probable that the  new coal tar dyes will be faster and cheaper. In point of durability,  sabutan mats would be superior to all others produced in the Islands  if woven of double straws. In price they now vary from forty centavos  to thirty pesos, the ordinary ones bringing from P1.50 to P2.50.    If the industry is to be preserved intact, however, something must  be done to give it vitality, for the weavers know from experience  of neighboring towns that more money can be made from weaving hats  than in the fabrication of mats, and they will naturally change to  the more remunerative article. Unlike most other weaving industries,  the craft has not as yet been organized in Tanay. The production of  mats has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#8)"],[1,"behind  the elastic band which we have already noticed. This muscle we will call  the \"Pyramid Muscle\" (pl. XI, 7). By the united action of the muscles  which have just been described the vocal chink is thrown in the shape  shown on pl.

XII, 1 and 2) are  a pair of horizontal projections running above and parallel with the  vocal ligaments (pl. XII, 3 and 4). The pocket ligaments are, like the  vocal ligaments, attached in front to the shield and behind to the  pyramids. They may be described as two ledge-shaped pads mainly formed  of glands. They are very sensitive and movable, and ready on the  smallest incitement to meet with great rapidity in order to protect the  vocal ligaments from any harm. They must, therefore, be chiefly regarded  as safeguards of the vocal apparatus, though it is probable that by  breaking the stream of air passing through the chink of the glottis,  they also exercise considerable influence upon the _quality_ of the tone  emitted. It may be affirmed, however, without the slightest hesitation,  that they have absolutely nothing to do with the _production_ of tone.  We shall see these glandular ledges again during our observations upon  the living subject, and I shall therefore say no more about them at  present.    [Illustration: PLATE XII.

TONGUE (HYOID) BONE.  ]    The space between the pocket ligaments and the vocal ligaments (pl. XII,  1, 2, 3, 4) is the entrance to two pouches or pockets which extend  outwards and upwards. The dimensions of these pockets vary very much in  different individuals. As a rule their height does not exceed two-fifths  of an inch, so that their terminations do not reach the upper borders of  the shield cartilage (pl. XII, 5 and 6). But there are instances in  which the pockets are nearly three-quarters of an inch high, and where  such is the case they, as a necessary consequence, reach beyond the  shield. Sometimes they are so high as nearly to touch the root of the  tongue. Their outer walls are chiefly formed of loose fatty cellular  tissue, and the pockets are almost entirely surrounded by a large number  of small glands.         Now these are the \"Laryngeal sacculi\" which, according to Mr.       Illingworth, produce the falsetto voice by \"acting in the same way       as a hazel-nut can be made to act as a whistle, when the kernel has       been extracted through a small hole in the shell,\" &c. I think,       however, that the reader will, from the description given above,       agree with me that the acoustic properties of the pockets of the       voicebox cannot be very great, and that, at all events, there is a       vast difference between their construction and that of a hazel-nut,       either with or without the kernel. Then there is this additional       difficulty, that even if one could whistle upon the pockets in the       manner suggested, there are two of them, covered, let it be       remembered, with a multitude of glands, continually producing       moisture, and liable to enlarge or to diminish. How, I should like       to know, could two such cavities be so tuned as under any       circumstances to produce exactly the same tones? Would not rather       frightful discords be the inevitable result? And again, what       provision is there in the pockets for the gradations of pitch? But       quite apart from these considerations, this and other similar       theories are completely disproved by the fact that every tone which       the human voice is capable of producing can be produced by       _inspiration as well as by expiration_. The tones sung by       inspiration are, as might be expected, wholly devoid of beauty,       because the vocal apparatus is, as it were, put upside down, and       the position of bellows and resonator reversed. But that does not       alter the question. The fact remains, and clearly proves that the       pockets have no more to do with the falsetto than with the chest       voice, because in inspiration the air strikes the vocal ligaments       _after it has passed_ the pockets, and yet the result is, beauty of       tone apart, exactly the same.    The function of the pockets, in my opinion, is this: They are the means  of isolating the vocal ligaments, thus enabling them to vibrate freely  and without hindrance. They also allow the sound-waves to expand  sideways, thereby materially adding to their resonance. Lastly, they  with their many little glands produce and supply the vocal ligaments  with that moisture without which, according to the investigations of J.  Mueller,[H] the production of tone cannot be carried on.    Above the pocket ligaments there is a kind of tube which is formed by  the upper part of the pyramids (surmounted by two little bodies called  the cartilages of Santorini, pl. XII, 7, 8) behind; the lid or  epiglottis (pl. XII, 9) in front, and sideways by two folds of mucous  membrane running up from the pyramids to the lid (pl. XII, 14, 10 and  15, 11). These folds are in many cases supported by two small  cartilages, which we will call the Wedges (pl. XII, 12, 13). These,  according to Madame Emma Seiler, are the chief factors in the formation  of the highest register of the female voice. In some physiological works  they are treated as of very little consequence, and in others they are  not mentioned at all.    These wedges are two thin strips of cartilage running in front of the  pyramids (pl. XII, 12 and 13) where they are embedded in a number of  glands. Their upper ends terminate in the cartilages of Wrisberg (pl.  XII, 14, 15), and their lower ends gradually dwindle away in the  direction of the vocal ligaments.         Madame Seiler says that they \"reach to the middle of the vocal       chords, by which they are enveloped.\"[I] She comments in the same       book on the fact that German anatomists have been reluctant to       admit the existence of these cartilages; and she adds on page 61,       \"It was, therefore, a great satisfaction to me to find them       described under the name of the cuneiform cartilages in Wilson's       'Human Anatomy.'\" It must be confessed, however, that Wilson's       description of them is totally different from Madame Seiler's. He       says, \"The cuneiform cartilages are two small cylinders of yellow       fibro-cartilage, about seven lines in length and enlarged at each       extremity. _By the lower end or base_ the cartilage is attached _to       the middle of the external surface_ of the arytenoid (the pyramid),       and by its upper extremity forms a prominence in the border of the       aryteno-epiglottidean fold of membrane\"[J] (_i.e._, the fold       running up to the lid). According to Seiler, therefore, the wedges       reach from the pyramids to the middle of the vocal ligaments, but       according to Wilson their bases are attached to the middle of the       outer surface of the pyramids, so that they cannot even touch the       vocal ligaments. As Madame Seiler assigns very important functions       to these wedges in the formation of the highest register of the       female voice, and as she quotes Wilson in a manner that must lead       the reader to suppose he gave a similar description to hers of       these cartilages, I have thought it right to give Wilson's       statement in full.         But there is a description of these cartilages by Dr. Witkowski       which corresponds very closely with Madame Seiler's. Speaking of       some of the glands of the voicebox, he says in the work mentioned       before, on p. 12--\"They are arranged in the form of an L, whose       vertical branch goes along the arytenoid cartilages (the pyramids),       _the horizontal branch following the direction of the vocal cords_.       _There is often found situated in the midst of this group of glands       the cuneiform cartilage of Wrisberg_, sometimes reduced to a mere       cartilaginous granule.\"         Dr. Elsberg also describes them on p. 37 of the treatise before       mentioned as \"elongated nodules\" in the hinder portion of the vocal       ligaments, and says they are found \"more often in the female than       in the male sex.\" He calls them the \"posterior vocal nodules,\" and       gives on p. 36 a diagram which shows them most clearly and       unmistakably. This point would therefore seem to be settled.    =The Resonator.=--We now come to the last part of our instrument, namely,  the resonator, which is formed of (1) the"]]]
