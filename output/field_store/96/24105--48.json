Yet, a short time after, he had been  detected in plotting to bring a French army into England; and he had  written to assure the Court of Saint Germains that he was acting in  concert with his brethren, and especially with Sancroft. The Whigs  called loudly for severity. Even the Tory counsellors of William owned  that indulgence had been carried to the extreme point. They made,  however, a last attempt to mediate. \"Will you and your brethren,\" said  Trevor to Lloyd, the nonjuring Bishop of Norwich, \"disown all connection  with Doctor Turner, and declare that what he has in his letters imputed  to you is false?\" Lloyd evaded the question. It was now evident that  William's forbearance had only emboldened the adversaries whom he had  hoped to conciliate. Even Caermarthen, even Nottingham, declared that it  was high time to fill the vacant sees. [45]    Tillotson was nominated to the Archbishopric, and was consecrated  on Whitsunday, in the church of St. Mary Le Bow. Compton, cruelly  mortified, refused to bear any part in the ceremony. His place was  supplied by Mew, Bishop of Winchester, who was assisted by Burnet,  Stillingfleet and Hough. The congregation was the most splendid that  had been seen in any place of worship since the coronation. The Queen's  drawingroom was, on that day, deserted. Most of the peers who were in  town met in the morning at Bedford House, and went thence in procession  to Cheapside. Norfolk, Caermarthen and Dorset were conspicuous in the  throng. Devonshire, who was impatient to see his woods at Chatsworth  in their summer beauty, had deferred his departure in order to mark his  respect for Tillotson. The crowd which lined the streets greeted the new  Primate warmly. For he had, during many years, preached in the City; and  his eloquence, his probity and the singular gentleness of his temper  and manners, had made him the favourite of the Londoners. [46] But the  congratulations and applauses of his friends could not drown the roar of  execration which the Jacobites set up. According to them, he was a thief  who had not entered by the door, but had climbed over the fences. He was  a hireling whose own the sheep were not, who had usurped the crook of  the good shepherd, and who might well be expected to leave the flock  at the mercy of every wolf. He was an Arian, a Socinian, a Deist, an  Atheist. He had cozened the world by fine phrases, and by a show of  moral goodness: but he was in truth a far more dangerous enemy of the  Church than he could have been if he had openly proclaimed himself a  disciple of Hobbes, and had lived as loosely as Wilmot. He had taught  the fine gentlemen and ladies who admired his style, and who were  constantly seen round his pulpit, that they might be very good  Christians, and yet might believe the account of the Fall in the book  of Genesis to be allegorical. Indeed they might easily be as good  Christians as he; for he had never been christened; his parents were  Anabaptists; he had lost their religion when he was a boy; and he had  never found another. In ribald lampoons he was nicknamed Undipped John.  The parish register of his baptism was produced in vain. His enemies  still continued to complain that they had lived to see fathers of the  Church who never were her children. They made up a story that the Queen  had felt bitter remorse for the great crime by which she had obtained a  throne, that in her agony she had applied to Tillotson, and that he had  comforted her by assuring her that the punishment of the wicked in  a future state would not be eternal. [47] The Archbishop's mind was  naturally of almost feminine delicacy, and had been rather softened than  braced by the habits of a long life, during which contending sects and  factions had agreed in speaking of his abilities with admiration and of  his character with esteem. The storm of obloquy which he had to face for  the first time at more than sixty years of age was too much for him. His  spirits declined; his health gave way; yet he neither flinched from his  duty nor attempted to revenge himself on his persecutors. A few days  after his consecration, some persons were seized while dispersing libels  in which he was reviled. The law officers of the Crown proposed to  institute prosecutions; but he insisted that nobody should be punished  on his account. [48] Once, when he had company with him, a sealed packet  was put into his hands; he opened it; and out fell a mask. His friends  were shocked and incensed by this cowardly insult; but the Archbishop,  trying to conceal his anguish by a smile, pointed to the pamphlets which  covered his table, and said that the reproach which the emblem of the  mask was intended to convey might be called gentle when compared with  other reproaches which he daily had to endure. After his death a bundle  of the savage lampoons which the nonjurors had circulated against him  was found among his papers with this indorsement: \"I pray God forgive  them; I do.\" [49]    The temper of the deposed primate was very different. He seems to have  been under a complete delusion as to his own importance. The immense  popularity which he had enjoyed three years before, the prayers and  tears of the multitudes who had plunged into the Thames to implore his  blessing, the enthusiasm with which the sentinels of the Tower had drunk  his health under the windows of his prison, the mighty roar of joy  which had risen from Palace Yard on the morning of his acquittal,  the triumphant night when every window from Hyde Park to Mile End had  exhibited seven candles, the midmost and tallest emblematical of him,  were still fresh in his recollection; nor had he the wisdom to perceive  that all this homage had been paid, not to his person, but to that  religion and to those liberties of which he was, for a moment, the  representative. The extreme tenderness with which the new government had  long persisted in treating him seems to have confirmed him in his  error. That a succession of conciliatory messages was sent to him from  Kensington, that he was offered terms so liberal as to be scarcely  consistent with the dignity of the Crown and the welfare of the State,  that his cold and uncourteous answers could not tire out the royal  indulgence, that, in spite of the loud clamours of the Whigs, and of  the provocations daily given by the Jacobites, he was residing, fifteen  months after deprivation, in the metropolitan palace, these things  seemed to him to indicate not the lenity but the timidity of the ruling  powers. He appears to have flattered himself that they would not dare to  eject him. The news, therefore, that his see had been filled threw him  into a passion which lasted as long as his life, and which hurried him  into many foolish and unseemly actions. Tillotson, as soon as he  was appointed, went to Lambeth in the hope that he might be able, by  courtesy and kindness, to soothe the irritation of which he was the  innocent cause. He stayed long in the antechamber, and sent in his name  by several servants; but Sancroft would not even return an answer.  [50] Three weeks passed; and still the deprived Archbishop showed no  disposition to move. At length he received an order intimating to him  the royal pleasure that he should quit the dwelling which had long  ceased to be his own, and in which he was only a guest. He resented this  order bitterly, and declared that he would not obey it. He would stay  till he was pulled out by the Sheriff's officers. He would defend  himself at law as long as he could do so without putting in any plea  acknowledging the authority of the usurpers. [51] The case was so clear  that he could not, by any artifice of chicanery, obtain more than a  short delay. When judgment had been given against him, he left the  palace, but directed his steward to retain possession. The consequence  was that the steward was taken into custody and heavily fined. Tillotson  sent a kind message to assure his predecessor that the fine should not  be exacted. But Sancroft was determined to have a grievance, and would  pay the money. [52]    From that time the great object of the narrowminded and peevish old  man was to tear in pieces the Church of which he had been the chief  minister. It was in vain that some of those nonjurors, whose virtue,  ability and learning were the glory of their party, remonstrated against  his design. \"Our deprivation,\"--such was the reasoning of Ken,--\"is,  in the sight of God, a nullity. We are, and shall be, till we die or  resign, the true Bishops of our sees. Those who assume our titles and  functions will incur the guilt of schism. But with us, if we act as  becomes us, the schism will die; and in the next generation the unity of  the Church will be restored. On the other hand, if we consecrate Bishops  to succeed us, the breach may last through ages, and we shall be justly  held accountable, not indeed for its origin, but for its continuance.\"  These considerations ought, on Sancroft's own principles, to have had  decisive weight with him; but his angry passions prevailed. Ken quietly  retired from the venerable palace of Wells. He had done, he said, with  strife, and should henceforth vent his feelings not in disputes but in  hymns. His charities to the unhappy of all persuasions, especially to  the followers of Monmouth and to the persecuted Huguenots, had been so  large that his whole private fortune consisted of seven hundred pounds,  and of a library which he could not bear to sell. But Thomas Thynne,  Viscount Weymouth, though not a nonjuror, did himself honour by offering  to the most virtuous of the nonjurors a tranquil and dignified asylum in  the princely mansion of Longleat. There Ken passed a happy and honoured  old age,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#8)"],[1,"country she would have presided at the late Woman's Rights Convention.           *       *       *       *       *    No modern man has been more written about than GOETHE, and the end of  books concerning him seems to be still distant. The last that we hear of  is called _Goethe's Dichterwerth_ (Value of Goethe as a Poet), written  by O. L. Hoffman, and published in the quaint old city of Nuremberg. It  treats first of the poet's relation to natural science, art and society:  next takes up the complaints of his antagonists; his poetic character;  his youthful productions; his lyrics; Goetz von Berlichingen; the Sorrows  of Werter; the influence of Italy on his mature mind; Egmont; Iphigenia  at Tauris; Tasso; the influence of the French Revolution; his relations  with Schiller; his Ballads; Hermann and Dorothea; the Natural Daughter;  Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship; and finally the productions of his  mature years, as Wilhelm Meister's Wander-years, the Elective  Affinities, and Faust. The work forms a complete commentary on the works  of Goethe, and is written in the warmest spirit of admiration for his  genius and influence.           *       *       *       *       *    HAGEN'S _Geschichte der Neuesten Zeit_ (History of Recent Times) is  worthy a place in the library of every historical student. It begins  with the downfall of Napoleon and is to come down to the present day.  The first volume has been published; it exhibits thorough mastery of the  materials, and great calmness and judgment in their use. The style is  clear, terse and graphic. The author, who is a professor of the  University of Heidelberg, is a decided republican.           *       *       *       *       *    COTTA'S splendid illustrated edition of the Bible (Luther's version) is  now finished. It is perhaps the best Illustrated Bible ever published.  The typography and woodcuts are admirable. Of the latter there are  eighty, after original designs by Jaeger, Overbeck, Schnorr, and others.           *       *       *       *       *    FALLERMAYER, the distinguished German traveller, is about abandoning the  fruitless polemics which have gained him so many foes, to devote himself  to more useful labors. He himself desires to be at peace with all the  world, and the antagonists which his trenchant pen has so often  unsparingly scarified, need fear him no longer. He is about to complete  and print the third volume of his Oriental Impressions of Travel. This  is reason for rejoicing. Fallermayer is one of the most charming and  instructive of travel-writers.           *       *       *       *       *    WALLON'S _Histoire de l'Esclavage dans l'Antiquite_, just published at  Paris, is a work of high value to those who wish to look into a branch  of history hitherto comparatively little cultivated, but destined to  attract the most profound attention. M. Wallon, who is one of the  candidates for the vacant seat in the French Academy, discusses in an  exhaustive manner the origin of slavery in the antique world, the  condition of bondmen in the various nations, and the gradual development  of the institution under all circumstances and in all countries. His  book is excellent for its manner, while in respect of matter the author  has drawn information from all accessible sources, and digested it with  judgment and impartiality. Thus he has produced a worthy contribution to  that great but yet unwritten work, so full of both tragic and epic  elements, the Annals of Labor. What a noble book might be made by some  competent writer who should grapple with the whole subject.           *       *       *       *       *    THE NARRATIVE of the United States South Sea Exploring Expedition, is  being translated into German, and published by Cotta of Stuttgard. The  second volume is just completed. Probably all the supplementary volumes,  as Hale's \"Ethnology,\" and Pickering's \"Races of Men,\" will follow.           *       *       *       *       *    MISS BARBAULD'S \"God in Nature\" has been translated into German by  Thecla von Gaupert, and illustrated by that most fertile and charming of  designers, Louis Richter. The translation is made from the thirtieth  English edition, and the price put within the reach of the poorer  classes, at fifty cents.           *       *       *       *       *    FREDERIC BODENSTEDT, the author of the successful book on the Wars of  the Circassians, has just published the conclusion of a new work, called  \"A Thousand and One Days in the Orient.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A COLLECTION OF HUNGARIAN MYTHICAL TRADITIONS AND FAIRY TALES, has  lately been published in German at Berlin, translated from the Magyar of  Erdily, by G.

KARL AUGUST ESPE, who for many years has filled the post of editor  to Brockhaus's _Conversations-Lexicon_, the work which forms the basis  of the Encyclopedia Americana, died near Leipzic on the 25th November  last. He was a man of great acquirements and unwearied industry, and was  well known and esteemed in the literary and scientific circles of the  continent. He was born at Kuehren, in 1804, and went to Leipzic in 1832.  Beside the great work above alluded to, he had charge of the annual  memoirs of the German Society for the study of the native language and  antiquities. Nearly two years ago he was attacked by a fit of apoplexy,  from the effect of which his mind did not recover. He has since been in  a lunatic asylum.           *       *       *       *       *    NEANDER'S Church History is printed as far as the year 1294. He had  continued the work in manuscript up to the beginning of the fifteenth  century, so that Wiclif, Huss, and other important precursors of the  Reformation have found a place in it. This last volume of this great  work will shortly be printed. Neander's various posthumous works are of  remarkable value, though very few of them are in a finished state.  According to the _Methodist Quarterly_, always well informed upon such  matters, his exegetical Lectures upon the New Testament are of even  greater merit than his compositions in history. They are soon to be  published at Berlin, from notes taken by his students.           *       *       *       *       *    NEANDER'S Practical Expositions of St. James and of St. Paul's Epistle  to the Philippians, are in process of translation by Mrs. H. C. Conant,  the wife of Professor Conant, of Hamilton, and one of the most  accomplished women in this country. A translation of Hagenbach's  _Kirchengeschichte des 18 und 19 Jahrhunderte_, may also be expected  from the same hand, and so will be done admirably.           *       *       *       *       *    SCHLEIERMACHER'S \"_Brief Outline of the Study of Theology_\" has been  translated by Rev.

Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Becquerel, Buchez, Delescluze,  Michel Chevalier, Philarete Chasles, and other literary and scientific  notabilities are among the contributors.           *       *       *       *       *    THE HOUSE OF DIDOT, at Paris, have just issued a most interesting volume  of the great work they have for some time been publishing under the  title of _L'Univers Pittoresque_. This volume is occupied with Japan,  the Burman Empire, Siam, Anam, the Malay peninsula, and Ceylon. The  letter-press is furnished by Col. Jancigny, who was formerly aid-de-camp  to the King of Oude, and has a thorough personal acquaintance with the  countries in question. To show how great is the multitude of elephants  in Ceylon, Col. J. speaks of an English officer who resided there, and  who had with his own hand killed above two thousand of these monsters.  The book, like all the rest of the series, is illustrated by numerous  engravings. The series is to consist of forty-five volumes. Only one or  two are now wanting to complete it. It is intended to afford a complete  description of all the countries, nations, religions, customs, manners,  &c. of the world.           *       *       *       *       *    M.

He is known to the public chiefly by his  translations of the Roman writers, poetical and prose, and by sundry  able critical papers in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. Opposing candidates  were Beranger, Alfred Musset, Jules Janin, Dumas, and others. Another  vacancy was to be filled in January, and among the candidates were  President Bonaparte, and the Count Montalembert, who are certainly more  conspicuous in politics than in letters, though one did write a book on  gunnery, and the other one on Elizabeth of Hungary.           *       *       *       *       *    Two collections of interesting and valuable official documents have just  been given to the Parisian public.
