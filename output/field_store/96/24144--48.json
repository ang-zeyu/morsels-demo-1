And on this subject there is a verse as follows:    \"By union with men the lust, desire, or passion of women is satisfied,  and the pleasure derived from the consciousness of it is called their  satisfaction.\"    The followers of Babhravya, however, say that the semen of women  continues to fall from the beginning of the sexual union to its end, and  it is right that it should be so, for if they had no semen there would  be no embryo.    To this there is an objection. In the beginning of coition the passion  of the woman is middling, and she cannot bear the vigorous thrusts of  her lover, but by degrees her passion increases until she ceases to  think about her body, and then finally she wishes to stop from further  coition.    This objection, however, does not hold good, for even in ordinary things  that revolve with great force, such as a potter's wheel, or a top, we  find that the motion at first is slow, but by degrees it becomes very  rapid. In the same way the passion of the woman having gradually  increased, she has a desire to discontinue coition, when all the semen  has fallen away. And there is a verse with regard to this as follows:    \"The fall of the semen of the man takes place only at the end of  coition, while the semen of the woman falls continually, and after the  semen of both has all fallen away then they wish for the discontinuance  of coition.\"[34]    Lastly, Vatsyayana is of opinion that the semen of the female falls in  the same way as that of the male.    Now some may ask here: If men and women are beings of the same kind, and  are engaged in bringing about the same result, why should they have  different works to do.    Vatsya says that this is so, because the ways of working as well as the  consciousness of pleasure in men and women are different. The difference  in the ways of working, by which men are the actors, and women are the  persons acted upon, is owing to the nature of the male and the female,  otherwise the actor would be sometimes the person acted upon, and vice  versa. And from this difference in the ways of working follows the  difference in the consciousness of pleasure, for a man thinks, \"this  woman is united with me,\" and a woman thinks, \"I am united with this  man.\"    It may be said that if the ways of working in men and women are  different, why should not there be a difference, even in the pleasure  they feel, and which is the result of those ways.    But this objection is groundless, for the person acting and the person  acted upon being of different kinds, there is a reason for the  difference in their ways of working; but there is no reason for any  difference in the pleasure they feel, because they both naturally derive  pleasure from the act they perform.[35]    On this again some may say that when different persons are engaged in  doing the same work, we find that they accomplish the same end or  purpose: while, on the contrary, in the case of men and women we find  that each of them accomplishes his or her own end separately, and this  is inconsistent. But this is a mistake, for we find that sometimes two  things are done at the same time, as for instance in the fighting of  rams, both the rams receive the shock at the same time on their heads.  Again, in throwing one wood apple against another, and also in a fight  or struggle of wrestlers. If it be said that in these cases the things  employed are of the same kind, it is answered that even in the case of  men and women, the nature of the two persons is the same. And as the  difference in their ways of working arises from the difference of their  conformation only, it follows that men experience the same kind of  pleasure as women do.    There is also a verse on this subject as follows: \"Men and women being  of the same nature, feel the same kind of pleasure, and therefore a man  should marry such a woman as will love him ever afterwards.\"    The pleasure of men and women being thus proved to be of the same kind,  it follows that in regard to time, there are nine kinds of sexual  intercourse, in the same way as there are nine kinds, according to the  force of passion.    There being thus nine kinds of union with regard to dimensions, force of  passion, and time, respectively, by making combinations of them,  innumerable kinds of union would be produced. Therefore in each  particular kind of sexual union, men should use such means as they may  think suitable for the occasion.[36]    At the first time of sexual union the passion of the male is intense,  and his time is short, but in subsequent unions on the same day the  reverse of this is the case. With the female, however, it is the  contrary, for at the first time her passion is weak, and then her time  long, but on subsequent occasions on the same day, her passion is  intense and her time short, until her passion is satisfied.      _On the different kinds of Love._    Men learned in the humanities are of opinion that love is of four kinds,  viz.:    1. Love acquired by continual habit.    2. Love resulting from the imagination.    3. Love resulting from belief.    4. Love resulting from the perception of external objects.    (1). Love resulting from the constant and continual performance and  habit, as for instance the love of sexual intercourse, the love of  hunting, the love of drinking, the love of gambling, etc., etc.    (2). Love which is felt for things to which we are not habituated, and  which proceeds entirely from ideas, is called love resulting from  imagination, as for instance, that love which some men and women and  eunuchs feel for the Auparishtaka or mouth congress, and that which is  felt by all for such things as embracing, kissing, etc., etc.    (3). The love which is mutual on both sides, and proved to be true, when  each looks upon the other as his or her very own, such is called love  resulting from belief by the learned.    (4). The love resulting from the perception of eternal objects is quite  evident and well-known to the world, because the pleasure which it  affords is superior to the pleasure of the other kinds of love, which  exists only for its sake.    What has been said in this chapter upon the subject of sexual union is  sufficient for the learned; but for the edification of the ignorant, the  same will now be treated of at length and in detail.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 33: High unions are said to be better than low ones, for in  the former it is possible for the male to satisfy his own passion  without injuring the female, while in the latter it is difficult for the  female to be satisfied by any means.]    [Footnote 34: The strength of passion with women varies a great deal,  some being easily satisfied, and others eager and willing to go on for a  long time. To satisfy these last thoroughly a man must have recourse to  art. It is certain that a fluid flows from the woman in larger or  smaller quantities, but her satisfaction is not complete until she has  experienced the \"spasme genesique,\" as described in a French work  recently published and called \"Breviare de l'Amour Experimental par le  Dr. Jules Guyot.\"]    [Footnote 35: This is a long dissertation very common among Sanscrit  authors, both when writing and talking socially. They start certain  propositions, and then argue for and against them. What it is presumed  the author means, is, that though both men and women derive pleasure  from the act of coition, the way it is produced is brought about by  different means, each individual performing his own work in the matter,  irrespective of the other, and each deriving individually their own  consciousness of pleasure from the act they perform. There is a  difference in the work that each does, and a difference in the  consciousness of pleasure that each has, but no difference in the  pleasure they feel, for each feels that pleasure to a greater or lesser  degree.]    [Footnote 36: This paragraph should be particularly noted, for it  specially applies to married men and their wives. So many men utterly  ignore the feelings of the women, and never pay the slightest attention  to the passion of the latter. To understand the subject thoroughly, it  is absolutely necessary to study it, and then a person will know that,  as dough is prepared for baking, so must a woman be prepared for sexual  intercourse, if she is to derive satisfaction from it.]          CHAPTER II.    OF THE EMBRACE.      This part of the Kama Shastra, which treats of sexual union, is also  called \"Sixty-four\" (Chatushshashti). Some old authors say that it is  called so, because it contains sixty-four chapters. Others are of  opinion that the author of this part being a person named Panchala, and  the person who recited the part of the Rig Veda called Dashatapa, which  contains sixty-four verses, being also called Panchala, the name  \"sixty-four\" has been given to the part of the work in honour of the Rig  Vedas. The followers of Babhravya say on the other hand that this part  contains eight subjects, viz., the embrace, kissing, scratching with the  nails or fingers, biting, lying down, making various sounds, playing the  part of a man, and the Auparishtaka, or mouth congress. Each of these  subjects being of eight kinds, and eight multiplied by eight being  sixty-four, this part is therefore named \"sixty-four.\" But Vatsyayana  affirms that as this part contains also the following subjects, viz.,  striking, crying, the acts of a man during congress, the various kinds  of congress, and other subjects, the name \"sixty-four\" is given to it  only accidentally. As, for instance, we say this tree is \"Saptaparna,\"  or seven-leaved, this offering of rice is \"Panchavarna,\" or  five-coloured, but the tree has not seven leaves, neither has the rice  five colours.    However the part sixty-four is now treated of, and the embrace, being  the first subject, will now be considered.    Now the embrace which indicates the mutual love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2785"],[0,"The Elusive Pimpernel (#8)"],[1,"to his  lips, he gave the answer to her questions:    \"When your ladyship has ceased to be the most admired woman in Europe,  namely, when I am in my grave.\"          Chapter VI: For the Poor of Paris        There was no time to say more then. For the laughing, chatting groups  of friends had once more closed up round Marguerite and her husband,  and she, ever on the alert, gave neither look nor sign that any serious  conversation had taken place between Sir Percy and herself.    Whatever she might feel or dread with regard to the foolhardy adventures  in which he still persistently embarked, no member of the League  ever guarded the secret of his chief more loyally than did Marguerite  Blakeney.    Though her heart overflowed with a passionate pride in her husband, she  was clever enough to conceal every emotion save that which Nature had  insisted on imprinting in her face, her present radiant happiness  and her irresistible love. And thus before the world she kept up that  bantering way with him, which had characterized her earlier matrimonial  life, that good-natured, easy contempt which he had so readily accepted  in those days, and which their entourage would have missed and would  have enquired after, if she had changed her manner towards him too  suddenly.    In her heart she knew full well that within Percy Blakeney's soul  she had a great and powerful rival: his wild, mad, passionate love of  adventure. For it he would sacrifice everything, even his life; she  dared not ask herself if he would sacrifice his love.    Twice in a few weeks he had been over to France: every time he went she  could not know if she would ever see him again. She could not imagine  how the French Committee of Public Safety could so clumsily allow the  hated Scarlet Pimpernel to slip through its fingers. But she never  attempted either to warn him or to beg him not to go. When he brought  Paul Deroulede and Juliette Marny over from France, her heart went  out to the two young people in sheer gladness and pride because of his  precious life, which he had risked for them.    She loved Juliette for the dangers Percy had passed, for the anxieties  she herself had endured; only to-day, in the midst of this beautiful  sunshine, this joy of the earth, of summer and of the sky, she had  suddenly felt a mad, overpowering anxiety, a deadly hatred of the  wild adventurous life, which took him so often away from her side. His  pleasant, bantering reply precluded her following up the subject, whilst  the merry chatter of people round her warned her to keep her words and  looks under control.    But she seemed now to feel the want of being alone, and, somehow, that  distant booth with its flaring placard, and the crier in the Phrygian  cap, exercised a weird fascination over her.    Instinctively she bent her steps thither, and equally instinctively the  idle throng of her friends followed her. Sir Percy alone had halted in  order to converse with Lord Hastings, who had just arrived.    \"Surely, Lady Blakeney, you have no though of patronising that  gruesome spectacle?\" said Lord Anthony Dewhurst, as Marguerite almost  mechanically had paused within a few yards of the solitary booth.    \"I don't know,\" she said, with enforced gaiety, \"the place seems  to attract me. And I need not look at the spectacle,\" she added  significantly, as she pointed to a roughly-scribbled notice at the  entrance of the tent: \"In aid of the starving poor of Paris.\"    \"There's a good-looking woman who sings, and a hideous mechanical toy  that moves,\" said one of the young men in the crowd. \"It is very dark  and close inside the tent. I was lured in there for my sins, and was in  a mighty hurry to come out again.\"    \"Then it must be my sins that are helping to lure me too at the present  moment,\" said Marguerite lightly. \"I pray you all to let me go in there.  I want to hear the good-looking woman sing, even if I do not see the  hideous toy on the move.\"    \"May I escort you then, Lady Blakeney?\" said Lord Tony.    \"Nay! I would rather go in alone,\" she replied a trifle impatiently. \"I  beg of you not to heed my whim, and to await my return, there, where the  music is at its merriest.\"    It had been bad manners to insist. Marguerite, with a little  comprehensive nod to all her friends, left the young cavaliers still  protesting and quickly passed beneath the roughly constructed doorway  that gave access into the booth.    A man, dressed in theatrical rags and wearing the characteristic scarlet  cap, stood immediately within the entrance, and ostentatiously rattled a  money box at regular intervals.    \"For the starving poor of Paris,\" he drawled out in nasal monotonous  tones the moment he caught sight of Marguerite and of her rich gown. She  dropped some gold into the box and then passed on.    The interior of the booth was dark and lonely-looking after the glare  of the hot September sun and the noisy crowd that thronged the sward  outside. Evidently a performance had just taken place on the elevated  platform beyond, for a few yokels seemed to be lingering in a desultory  manner as if preparatory to going out.    A few disjointed comments reached Marguerite's ears as she approached,  and the small groups parted to allow her to pass. One or two women  gaped in astonishment at her beautiful dress, whilst others bobbed a  respectful curtsey.    The mechanical toy arrested her attention immediately. She did not find  it as gruesome as she expected, only singularly grotesque, with all  those wooden little figures in their quaint, arrested action.    She drew nearer to have a better look, and the yokels who had lingered  behind, paused, wondering if she would make any remark.    \"Her ladyship was born in France,\" murmured one of the men, close to  her, \"she would know if the thing really looks like that.\"    \"She do seem interested,\" quoth another in a whisper.    \"Lud love us all!\" said a buxom wench, who was clinging to the arm of a  nervous-looking youth, \"I believe they're coming for more money.\"    On the elevated platform at the further end of the tent, a slim  figure had just made its appearance, that of a young woman dressed in  peculiarly sombre colours, and with a black lace hood thrown lightly  over her head.    Marguerite thought that the face seemed familiar to her, and she also  noticed that the woman carried a large embroidered reticule in her  bemittened hand.    There was a general exodus the moment she appeared. The Richmond yokels  did not like the look of that reticule. They felt that sufficient  demand had already been made upon their scant purses, considering the  meagerness of the entertainment, and they dreaded being lured to further  extravagance.    When Marguerite turned away from the mechanical toy, the last of the  little crowd had disappeared, and she was alone in the booth with the  woman in the dark kirtle and black lace hood.    \"For the poor of Paris, Madame,\" said the latter mechanically, holding  out her reticule.    Marguerite was looking at her intently. The face certainly seemed  familiar, recalling to her mind the far-off days in Paris, before  she married. Some young actress no doubt driven out of France by that  terrible turmoil which had caused so much sorrow and so much suffering.  The face was pretty, the figure slim and elegant, and the look of  obvious sadness in the dark, almond-shaped eyes was calculated to  inspire sympathy and pity.    Yet, strangely enough, Lady Blakeney felt repelled and chilled by this  sombrely-dressed young person: an instinct, which she could not have  explained and which she felt had no justification, warned her that  somehow or other, the sadness was not quite genuine, the appeal for the  poor not quite heartfelt.    Nevertheless, she took out her purse, and dropping some few sovereigns  into the capacious reticule, she said very kindly:    \"I hope that you are satisfied with your day's work, Madame; I fear  me our British country folk hold the strings of their purses somewhat  tightly these times.\"    The woman sighed and shrugged her shoulders.    \"Oh, Madame!\" she said with a tone of great dejection, \"one does what  one can for one's starving countrymen, but it is very hard to elicit  sympathy over here for them, poor dears!\"    \"You are a Frenchwoman, of course,\" rejoined Marguerite, who had noted  that though the woman spoke English with a very pronounced foreign  accent, she had nevertheless expressed herself with wonderful fluency  and correctness.    \"Just like Lady Blakeney herself,\" replied the other.    \"You know who I am?    \"Who could come to Richmond and not know Lady Blakeney by sight.\"    \"But what made you come to Richmond on this philanthropic errand of  yours?\"    \"I go where I think there is a chance of earning a little money for  the cause which I have at heart,\" replied the Frenchwoman with the same  gentle simplicity, the same tone of mournful dejection.    What she said was undoubtedly noble and selfless. Lady Blakeney felt in  her heart that her keenest sympathy should have gone out to this  young woman--pretty, dainty, hardly more than a girl--who seemed to be  devoting her young life in a purely philanthropic and unselfish cause.  And yet in spite of herself, Marguerite seemed unable to shake off that  curious sense of mistrust which had assailed her from the first, nor  that feeling of unreality and staginess with which the Frenchwoman's  attitude had originally struck her.    Yet she tried to be kind and to be cordial, tried to hide that coldness  in her manner which she felt was unjustified.    \"It is all very praiseworthy on your part, Madame,\" she said somewhat  lamely. \"Madame...?\" she added interrogatively.    \"My name is Candeille--Desiree Candeille,\" replied the Frenchwoman.    \"Candeille?\" exclaimed Marguerite with sudden alacrity, \"Candeille...  surely...\"    \"Yes... of the Varietes.\"    \"Ah! then I know why your face from the first seemed"]]]
