So away again to the houses of confectioners who had given  the children candy,--to Miss Simonds's house, because she had been so  good to them in school,--to the palaces of millionnaires who had prayed  for these children with tears if the children only knew it,--to Dr.  Frothingham's in Summer Street, I remember, where we stopped because the  Boston Association of Ministers met there,--and out on Dover Street  Bridge, that the poor chair-mender might hear our carols sung once more  before he heard them better sung in another world where nothing needs  mending.        \"King of glory, king of peace!\"      \"Hear the song, and see the Star!\"      \"Welcome be thou, heavenly King!\"      \"Was not Christ our Saviour?\"    and all the others, rung out with order or without order, breaking the  hush directly as the horses' bells were stilled, thrown into the air  with all the gladness of childhood, selected sometimes as Harry happened  to think best for the hearers, but more often as the jubilant and  uncontrolled enthusiasm of the children bade them break out in the most  joyous, least studied, and purely lyrical of all. O, we went to twenty  places that night, I suppose! We went to the grandest places in Boston,  and we went to the meanest. Everywhere they wished us a merry Christmas,  and we them. Everywhere a little crowd gathered round us, and then we  dashed away far enough to gather quite another crowd; and then back,  perhaps, not sorry to double on our steps if need were, and leaving  every crowd with a happy thought of        \"The star, the manger, and the Child!\"    At nine we brought up at my house, D Street, three doors from the  corner, and the children picked their very best for Polly and my six  little girls to hear, and then for the first time we let them jump out  and run in. Polly had some hot oysters for them, so that the frolic was  crowned with a treat. There was a Christmas cake cut into sixteen  pieces, which they took home to dream upon; and then hoods and muffs on  again, and by ten o'clock, or a little after, we had all the girls and  all the little ones at their homes. Four of the big boys, our two  flankers and Harry's right and left hand men, begged that they might  stay till the last moment. They could walk back from the stable, and  \"rather walk than not, indeed.\" To which we assented, having gained  parental permission, as we left younger sisters in their respective  homes.      II.    Lycidas and I both thought, as we went into these modest houses, to  leave the children, to say they had been good and to wish a \"Merry  Christmas\" ourselves to fathers, mothers, and to guardian aunts, that  the welcome of those homes was perhaps the best part of it all. Here  was the great stout sailor-boy whom we had not seen since he came back  from sea. He was a mere child when he left our school years on years  ago, for the East, on board Perry's vessel, and had been round the  world. Here was brave Mrs. Masury. I had not seen her since her mother  died. \"Indeed, Mr. Ingham, I got so used to watching then, that I cannot  sleep well yet o' nights; I wish you knew some poor creature that wanted  me to-night, if it were only in memory of Bethlehem.\" \"You take a deal  of trouble for the children,\" said Campbell, as he crushed my hand in  his; \"but you know they love you, and you know I would do as much for  you and yours,\"--which I knew was true. \"What can I send to your  children?\" said Dalton, who was finishing sword-blades. (Ill wind was  Fort Sumter, but it blew good to poor Dalton, whom it set up in the  world with his sword-factory.) \"Here's an old-fashioned tape-measure for  the girl, and a Sheffield wimble for the boy. What, there is no boy? Let  one of the girls have it then; it will count one more present for her.\"  And so he pressed his brown-paper parcel into my hand. From every house,  though it were the humblest, a word of love, as sweet, in truth, as if  we could have heard the voice of angels singing in the sky.    I bade Harry good-night; took Lycidas to his lodgings, and gave his wife  my Christmas wishes and good-night; and, coming down to the sleigh  again, gave way to the feeling which I think you will all understand,  that this was not the time to stop, but just the time to begin. For the  streets were stiller now, and the moon brighter than ever, if possible,  and the blessings of these simple people and of the grand people, and of  the very angels in heaven, who are not bound to the misery of using  words when they have anything worth saying,--all these wishes and  blessings were round me, all the purity of the still winter night, and I  didn't want to lose it all by going to bed to sleep. So I put the boys  all together, where they could chatter, took one more brisk turn on the  two avenues, and then, passing through Charles Street, I believe I was  even thinking of Cambridge, I noticed the lights in Woodhull's house,  and, seeing they were up, thought I would make Fanny a midnight call.  She came to the door herself. I asked if she were waiting for Santa  Claus, but saw in a moment that I must not joke with her. She said she  had hoped I was her husband. In a minute was one of these contrasts  which make life, life. God puts us into the world that we may try them  and be tried by them. Poor Fanny's mother had been blocked up on the  Springfield train as she was coming on to Christmas. The old lady had  been chilled through, and was here in bed now with pneumonia. Both  Fanny's children had been ailing when she came, and this morning the  doctor had pronounced it scarlet fever. Fanny had not undressed herself  since Monday, nor slept, I thought, in the same time. So while we had  been singing carols and wishing merry Christmas, the poor child had been  waiting, and hoping that her husband or Edward, both of whom were on the  tramp, would find for her and bring to her the model nurse, who had not  yet appeared. But at midnight this unknown sister had not arrived, nor  had either of the men returned. When I rang, Fanny had hoped I was one  of them. Professional paragons, dear reader, are shy of scarlet fever. I  told the poor child that it was better as it was. I wrote a line for Sam  Perry to take to his aunt, Mrs. Masury, in which I simply said: \"Dear  mamma, I have found the poor creature who wants you to-night. Come back  in this carriage.\" I bade him take a hack at Barnard's, where they were  all up waiting for the assembly to be done at Papanti's. I sent him over  to Albany Street; and really as I sat there trying to soothe Fanny, it  seemed to me less time than it has taken me to dictate this little story  about her, before Mrs. Masury rang gently, and I left them, having made  Fanny promise that she would consecrate the day, which at that moment  was born, by trusting God, by going to bed and going to sleep, knowing  that her children were in much better hands than hers. As I passed out  of the hall, the gas-light fell on a print of Correggio's Adoration,  where Woodhull had himself written years before,        \"Ut appareat iis qui in tenebris et umbra mortis positi sunt.\"    \"Darkness and the shadow of death\" indeed, and what light like the light  and comfort such a woman as my Mary Masury brings!    And so, but for one of the accidents, as we call them, I should have  dropped the boys at the corner of Dover Street, and gone home with my  Christmas lesson.    But it happened, as we irreverently say,--it happened as we crossed Park  Square, so called from its being an irregular pentagon of which one of  the sides has been taken away, that I recognized a tall man, plodding  across in the snow, head down, round-shouldered, stooping forward in  walking, with his right shoulder higher than his left; and by these  tokens I knew Tom Coram, prince among Boston princes. Not Thomas Coram  that built the Foundling Hospital, though he was of Boston too; but he  was longer ago. You must look for him in Addison's contribution to a  supplement to the Spectator,--the old Spectator, I mean, not the  Thursday Spectator, which is more recent. Not Thomas Coram, I say, but  Tom Coram, who would build a hospital to-morrow, if you showed him the  need, without waiting to die first, and always helps forward, as a  prince should, whatever is princely, be it a statue at home, a school at  Richmond, a newspaper in Florida, a church in Exeter, a steam-line to  Liverpool, or a widow who wants a hundred dollars. I wished him a merry  Christmas, and Mr. Howland, by a fine instinct, drew up the horses as I  spoke. Coram shook hands; and, as it seldom happens that I have an empty  carriage while he is on foot, I asked him if I might not see him home.  He was glad to get in. We wrapped him up with spoils of the bear, the  fox, and the bison, turned the horses' heads again,--five hours now  since they started on this entangled errand of theirs,--and gave him his  ride. \"I was thinking of you at the moment,\" said Coram,--\"thinking of  old college times, of the mystery of language as unfolded by the Abbe  Faria to Edmond Dantes in the depths of the Chateau d'If. I was  wondering if you could teach me Japanese, if I asked you to a Christmas  dinner.\" I laughed. Japan was really a novelty then, and I asked him  since when he had been in correspondence with the sealed country. It  seemed that their house at Shanghae had just sent across there their  agents for establishing the first house in Edomo, in Japan, under the  new treaty. Everything looked promising, and the beginnings were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32505"],[0,"The Systematics of the Frogs of the Hyla Rubra Group in Middle America (#8)"],[1,"having broad  palatines and comparatively larger nasals that are truncate anteriorly.  In _staufferi_ the nasal is rounded anteriorly and the palatine is  absent.    _Distribution._--_Hyla elaeochroa_ occurs on the Caribbean lowlands  from western Panama through Costa Rica to eastern Nicaragua, and on the  Pacific lowlands of southeastern Costa Rica and extreme western Panama.  Most localities where it has been collected are below 800 meters, but  the species has been found at two localities above 1000 meters (El  Silencio and Pacuare, Cartago Province) on the Caribbean slopes of the  Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica (Fig. 6).    _Specimens Examined._--Nicaragua: _Zelaya_: El Recreo, UMMZ 79721 (9).

Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 17:165,      October 1, 1865 [Holotype.--USNM 15317, Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico;      Francis Sumichrast collector].    _Diagnosis._--Small frogs (Male to 29 mm., Female to 31.6 mm.); skull  longer than wide; palatine absent; large cartilaginous crista parotica  present; snout flat, elongate and protruding; dark interorbital bar and  dorsal stripes usually present.    _Description._--Head flat, especially in females, longer than wide;  snout long, protruding beyond mouth; loreal region concave; canthus  ill-defined; length of eye greater than internarial distance or width  of eyelid; length of eye less than interorbital space; tympanum  distinct; interorbital spot irregular; supratympanic fold faint; arms  short; fingers free of webs; discs on third and fourth fingers equal to  diameter of tympanum; inner metatarsal tubercle on base of first finger  distinct; first finger shorter than second; palmar tubercle distinct  (Fig. 1C); legs short (usually less than 50 per cent of snout-vent  length); tarsal fold absent; metatarsal tubercles small, outer tubercle  smaller than inner; subarticular tubercles small, simple, distinct;  toes less than half webbed (Fig. 1D); skin smooth above with a few  small pustules on head, scapular region, flanks, and supratympanic  region; arms and legs smooth; skin of belly coarsely granular;  posteroventral surfaces of thighs finely granular; tongue small,  rounded, longer than wide, slightly free and notched posteriorly; vocal  slits small, lateral to tongue; choanae moderate in size.    _Variation._--The largest males of _Hyla staufferi_ are from Jalapa,  Guatemala, and from San Salvador, El Salvador. In these samples the  average snout-vent length is 27 mm. In Panamanian specimens the average  snout-vent length is 23.6 mm. Slight variation in the ratio of tibia  length to snout-vent length exists throughout the range; more variation  exists in the ratio of the diameter of the tympanum to that of the eye;  the tympanum is proportionately larger in northern populations (Table  7). The primary differences between Panamanian and more northern  populations are in size, color pattern on the dorsum and shanks, amount  of webbing between the toes, and duration of notes in the mating call  (Table 2, Pl. 4).    The color in Panamanian _staufferi_ is gray or gray-brown with a pair  of distinct, complete, dark brown dorsolateral stripes, a pair of  entire paravertebral stripes, and in some specimens a vertebral stripe.  About five per cent of the individuals have interrupted stripes on the  dorsum, whereas in the more northern populations complete paravertebral  stripes are present in less ten per cent of the specimens; when  complete stripes are present, they are irregular. The dorsal ground  color in non-Panamanian specimens is brown, olive-brown, or dark brown.    Transverse bars are present on the shanks in _Hyla staufferi_ from  Costa Rica northward to Mexico, whereas in Panama all the individuals  have a longitudinal stripe on the shank (Table 7, Pl. 2). The  interorbital spot or bar is more noticeable in northern populations  than in specimens from Panama. Frogs from Costa Rica and northward have  the toes about three fourths webbed, whereas in Panama the toes are  about two fifths webbed. The mating calls of the northern and  Panamanian populations are similar, but the notes have a longer  duration in the northern populations and a higher dominant frequency in  Panamanian populations.    _Hyla staufferi_ is the most variable member of the _Hyla rubra_ group  in Central America. The Panamanian populations are geographically  separated from the Costa Rican and more northern populations by an area  of tropical rainforest in the Golfo Dulce region in southeastern Costa  Rica and adjacent Panama. _Hyla staufferi_ does not occur on the  Caribbean versant of Costa Rica and Panama. The Golfo Dulce region and  the Caribbean versant are humid and inhabited by _Hyla elaeochroa_.  _Hyla staufferi_ is an inhabitant of subhumid and xeric areas.    On the basis of the discontinuous variation in several characters which  correlate with the disjunct distribution of the two populations, two  subspecies of _Hyla staufferi_ are recognized. The accounts that follow  apply equally to each.    _Cranial Osteology._--The skull of _Hyla staufferi_ is flat and longer  than wide. The premaxillary is small and bears 9 to 13 teeth (mean for  5 specimens, 11.3). The alary process of the premaxillary is small,  concave posteriorly and vertical. Ventrally, the premaxillary is united  to the prevomers by partially ossified cartilage. The maxillary is  slender and usually bears 49 to 70 teeth (mean for 5 specimens, 60.7).  The pars facialis of the maxillary is convex and less than twice the  height of the pars dentalis.    The nasal is large, rounded anteriorly, and pointed posteriorly in  dorsal view. The nasal comprises about 40 per cent of the total length  of the skull. Anteromedially the two nasals converge; posteriorly they  overlap the sphenethmoid. The nasals lack a concavity in the midlateral  surface. Dorsally, the sphenethmoid is wider than long, roughly  pentagonal in shape; the frontoparietal is elongate, narrow, and  smooth, with a small supraorbital process anteriorly. The  frontoparietal fontanelle is narrow anteriorly and wide posteriorly.    TABLE 7.--Geographic Variation in Size and Color in Males of _Hyla  staufferi_.
