For though our sun, and all the stars we see, may truly be said  to be in the plane of the Milky Way, yet I am now convinced, by a long  inspection and continued examination of it, that the Milky Way itself  consists of stars very differently scattered from those which are  immediately about us.\" \"This immense aggregation,\" he added, \"is by no  means uniform. Its component stars show evident signs of clustering  together into many separate allotments.\"[37]    The following sentences, written in 1811, contain a definite  retractation of the view frequently attributed to him:--    \"I must freely confess,\" he says, \"that by continuing my sweeps of the  heavens my opinion of the arrangement of the stars and their magnitudes,  and of some other particulars, has undergone a gradual change; and  indeed, when the novelty of the subject is considered, we cannot be  surprised that many things formerly taken for granted should on  examination prove to be different from what they were generally but  incautiously supposed to be. For instance, an equal scattering of the  stars may be admitted in certain calculations; but when we examine the  Milky Way, or the closely compressed clusters of stars of which my  catalogues have recorded so many instances, this supposed equality of  scattering must be given up.\"[38]    Another assumption, the fallacy of which he had not the means of  detecting since become available, was retained by him to the end of his  life. It was that the brightness of a star afforded an approximate  measure of its distance. Upon this principle he founded in 1817 his  method of \"limiting apertures,\"[39] by which two stars, brought into  view in two precisely similar telescopes, were \"equalised\" by covering a  certain portion of the object-glass collecting the more brilliant rays.  The distances of the orbs compared were then taken to be in the ratio of  the reduced to the original apertures of the instruments with which they  were examined. If indeed the absolute lustre of each were the same, the  result might be accepted with confidence; but since we have no warrant  for assuming a \"standard star\" to facilitate our computations, but much  reason to suppose an indefinite range, not only of size but of intrinsic  brilliancy, in the suns of our firmament, conclusions drawn from such a  comparison are entirely worthless.    In another branch of sidereal science besides that of stellar  aggregation, Herschel may justly be styled a pioneer. He was the first  to bestow serious study on the enigmatical objects known as \"nebulae.\"  The history of the acquaintance of our race with them is comparatively  short. The only one recognised before the invention of the telescope was  that in the girdle of Andromeda, certainly familiar in the middle of the  tenth century to the Persian astronomer Abdurrahman Al-Sufi; and marked  with dots on Spanish and Dutch constellation-charts of the fourteenth  and fifteenth centuries.[40] Yet so little was it noticed that it might  practically be said--as far as Europe is concerned--to have been  discovered in 1612 by Simon Marius (Mayer of Genzenhausen), who aptly  described its appearance as that of a \"candle shining through horn.\" The  first mention of the great Orion nebula is by a Swiss Jesuit named  Cysatus, who succeeded Father Scheiner in the chair of mathematics at  Ingolstadt. He used it, apparently without any suspicion of its novelty,  as a term of comparison for the comet of December 1618.[41] A novelty,  nevertheless, to astronomers it still remained in 1656, when Huygens  discerned, \"as it were, an hiatus in the sky, affording a glimpse of a  more luminous region beyond.\"[42] Halley in 1716 knew of six nebulae,  which he believed to be composed of a \"lucid medium\" diffused through  the ether of space.[43] He appears, however, to have been unacquainted  with some previously noticed by Hevelius. Lacaille brought back with him  from the Cape a list of forty-two--the first-fruits of observation in  Southern skies--arranged in three numerically equal classes;[44] and  Messier (nicknamed by Louis XV. the \"ferret of comets\"), finding such  objects a source of extreme perplexity in the pursuit of his chosen  game, attempted to eliminate by methodising them, and drew up a  catalogue comprising, in 1781, 103 entries.[45]    These preliminary attempts shrank into insignificance when Herschel  began to \"sweep the heavens\" with his giant telescopes. In 1786 he  presented to the Royal Society a descriptive catalogue of 1,000 nebulae  and clusters, followed, three years later, by a second of as many more;  to which he added in 1802 a further gleaning of 500. On the subject of  their nature his views underwent a remarkable change. Finding that his  potent instruments resolved into stars many nebulous patches in which no  signs of such a structure had previously been discernible, he naturally  concluded that \"resolvability\" was merely a question of distance and  telescopic power. He was (as he said himself) led on by almost  imperceptible degrees from evident clusters, such as the Pleiades, to  spots without a trace of stellar formation, the gradations being so well  connected as to leave no doubt that all these phenomena were equally  stellar. The singular variety of their appearance was thus described by  him:--    \"I have seen,\" he says, \"double and treble nebulae variously arranged;  large ones with small, seeming attendants; narrow, but much extended  lucid nebulae or bright dashes; some of the shape of a fan, resembling an  electric brush, issuing from a lucid point; others of the cometic shape,  with a seeming nucleus in the centre, or like cloudy stars surrounded  with a nebulous atmosphere; a different sort, again, contain a  nebulosity of the milky kind, like that wonderful, inexplicable  phenomenon about Theta Orionis; while others shine with a fainter,  mottled kind of light, which denotes their being resolvable into  stars.\"[46]    \"These curious objects\" he considered to be \"no less than whole sidereal  systems,\"[47] some of which might \"well outvie our Milky Way in  grandeur.\" He admitted, however, a wide diversity in condition as well  as compass. The system to which our sun belongs he described as \"a very  extensive branching congeries of many millions of stars, which probably  owes its origin to many remarkably large as well as pretty closely  scattered small stars, that may have drawn together the rest.\"[48] But  the continued action of this same \"clustering power\" would, he supposed,  eventually lead to the breaking-up of the original majestic Galaxy into  two or three hundred separate groups, already visibly gathering. Such  minor nebulae, due to the \"decay\" of other \"branching nebulae\" similar to  our own, he recognised by the score, lying, as it were, stratified in  certain quarters of the sky. \"One of these nebulous beds,\" he informs  us, \"is so rich that in passing through a section of it, in the time of  only thirty-six minutes, I detected no less than thirty-one nebulae, all  distinctly visible upon a fine blue sky.\" The stratum of Coma Berenices  he judged to be the nearest to our system of such layers; nor did the  marked aggregation of nebulae towards both poles of the circle of the  Milky Way escape his notice.    By a continuation of the same process of reasoning, he was enabled (as  he thought) to trace the life-history of nebulae from a primitive loose  and extended formation, through clusters of gradually increasing  compression, down to the kind named by him \"Planetary\" because of the  defined and uniform discs which they present. These he regarded as \"very  aged, and drawing on towards a period of change or dissolution.\"[49]    \"This method of viewing the heavens,\" he concluded, \"seems to throw them  into a new kind of light. They now are seen to resemble a luxuriant  garden which contains the greatest variety of productions in different  flourishing beds; and one advantage we may at least reap from it is,  that we can, as it were, extend the range of our experience to an  immense duration. For, to continue the simile which I have borrowed from  the vegetable kingdom, is it not almost the same thing whether we live  successively to witness the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity,  fading, withering, and corruption of a plant, or whether a vast number  of specimens, selected from every stage through which the plant passes  in the course of its existence, be brought at once to our view?\"[50]    But already this supposed continuity was broken. After mature  deliberation on the phenomena presented by nebulous stars, Herschel was  induced, in 1791, to modify essentially his original opinion.    \"When I pursued these researches,\" he says, \"I was in the situation of a  natural philosopher who follows the various species of animals and  insects from the height of their perfection down to the lowest ebb of  life; when, arriving at the vegetable kingdom, he can scarcely point out  to us the precise boundary where the animal ceases and the plant begins;  and may even go so far as to suspect them not to be essentially  different. But, recollecting himself, he compares, for instance, one of  the human species to a tree, and all doubt upon the subject vanishes  before him. In the same manner we pass through gentle steps from a  coarse cluster of stars, such as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28257"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"on,  India, and then in Africa, the most valuable of all its area--and  you have the dominions and the colonies of the British Empire!    Between Germany and the rest of the world is the British navy. Every  German ship which sails the trade routes of the earth must go past  the British threshold. Germany, with a rapidly increasing  population, with an imperial patriotism which discouraged emigration  to foreign countries, wished to extend her domain; she wanted room  in which German national ambition could expand.    Through all her history, Britain has had one eye on the continent  and one on the seas. Continental affairs concerned her only so far  as they meant the rise of any power which might threaten her  dominion of the seas. The silver-pewter streak of channel kept her  safe from invasion by any continental power, yet she could land  troops across the Channel and throw the weight of her forces in the  balance when her dominion was threatened. It is her boast that she  has always won the \"last battle,\" which is sufficient. She had only  30,000 troops in the allied army under Wellington, which delivered  the finishing blow to Napoleon.    Twenty years ago, when the German navy was in its infancy, her  policy was one of splendid isolation. France then was the second  naval power, and Russia the third. The British naval program was  superior to any two continental powers. The increase in German  population and in trade and wealth brought with it an increase in  the German navy, until Germany, with her ally, Austria, became the  threatening continental factor to British security.    Now Britain formed a combination for defense with Russia and France.  Her military part was to send 120,000 troops across the Channel to  cooperate with the French army against the Germans. She was the only  one of the great nations, except the United States, that depended  upon a regular army, which was occupied mostly in policing her  empire. Aside from her regulars, her only military organization were  her Territorials, which were something on the same order as the  American National Guard.    The number of men which she could throw across the Channel was  therefore insignificant, compared to the great hordes of the  European armies. Her real part was command of the sea. She was  either to destroy the German navy or make it helpless in interfering  with allied trade on the seas. Her Government was Liberal, her  people as a whole skeptical of the possibility of a European war.  For centuries they had been bred to believe that her security was in  her fleet. She had long enjoyed her empire, she possessed immense  capital, and her inclination was toward complacency, while Germany's  was that of the eager newcomer to power.    The situation in Ireland on account of the passage of the Home Rule  Bill had become so strained that many people believed civil war to  be inevitable. The conviction of the German Ambassador in London, as  well as most German observers, was that Britain would not actually  enter the war, when the test came. Upon her decision, it is now  evident, depended the fate of Europe. With England out, the French  army could not have saved France. For then, Germany could have had  the freedom of the seas. Her navy would have sent the French into  harbor, closing not only every French, but every Russian port to the  entrance of supplies and munitions, which would have meant food  scarcity in France, and utter scarcity of munitions in Russia.    German troops could have landed in France to the rear of the French  army. The whole complexion of the war would have been changed. So  well laid were their plans, so sure were they of their numbers of  men and guns, which they could promptly concentrate, that there  seems little question of the ability of the Central Powers to have  crushed France in the first three months of the war, and then to  have won a decisive victory over Russia, bringing home from either  country great indemnities, and, with Germany, if she choose,  annexing northern France and Belgium.    Thus the Central Powers would have established themselves so  strongly as the dominant nations of Europe, that Germany with her  seventy millions of people could have directed her energy as the  next step in her career against the Mistress of the Seas.    Had Belgium not been invaded, it is questionable if the British  public would have favored joining in the war. But this aroused  public indignation to the breaking point in support of the war  members of the cabinet. Sir Edward Grey, the British Minister of  Foreign Affairs, had his way.    The British navy was as thoroughly prepared for an emergency as the  German army. It had no illusions as to the nature of its task or of  its responsibility to the nation. Britain had superior resources in  shipbuilding to Germany. She had a fleet superior in every class of  ship, and she had led the world in naval progress--both her  dreadnoughts and her battle cruisers being of a later type than her  rival's. Her desire, inevitably, was that the German fleet should  come out at once and give battle. Confident of the outcome, she  contemplated the removal of her rival from the seas at a single  blow.    German naval policy was as careful to avoid this test as British was  to invite it. The German navy was kept safely at anchor in Kiel,  protected by immense fortress guns, by elaborate mine fields, scores  of submarines and destroyers, and by numerous nets against the  approach of any British submarine. There was no way for any enemy to  reach it except by the air. The Germans would have located any  British attempt to attack their navy, as it might have meant the  loss of important British fighting units which would have given the  Germans more nearly equal chances of victory if they chose to  precipitate an engagement. Sir John Jellicoe, in command of the  fleet, however, refused to take any risks of losing his units. He  kept his fleet in harbor, ready at any moment to steam out into the  North Sea for action. Throughout the war to this writing, not one of  his great first-class battleships has fired a shot, with the  exception of the _Queen Elizabeth_, which took part in the  bombardment of the Dardanelles forts.    Superiority of gun power has been sufficient to keep England safe  from invasion, German merchant ships from sailing the seas, protect  the sea passage of millions of troops, and insure the occupation of  the German colonies by British expeditionary forces. Except as it  was raised over a submarine or commerce raider, the German flag was  swept from the sea within the first six months of the war.    There has been no naval battle at all commensurate with the strength  of the two fleets. Each time that a British and German ship have met  in action, the overwhelming importance of speed and of gun range  have been demonstrated. Speed and range enabled Von Spee to destroy  Cradock's squadron at Coronel off Chile, with almost no loss to  himself. Later at the Falkland Islands he suffered the same fate at  the hands of Sturdee, who, with his second-class battle cruisers,  had the speed and range of the German third-class.    Again, in the battle off Dogger Bank, the _Bluecher_, the  second-class battle cruiser which had only 26 knots, was left behind  by her sisters, the German first-class battle cruisers, while she  was pounded into the sea by the _Lion_, the _Tiger_, and the  _Princess Mary_, which were driving ahead at 30 knots. The honors of  the war, so far as the offensive goes, therefore, have been with the  last battle cruiser.    German naval policy, no less wise for its own ends than for the  British, has depended upon the submarine, whose importance may be  easily exaggerated and easily underestimated. No submarine can  approach the major fighting ships of a great fleet when that fleet  is properly protected by torpedo-defense guns and fast destroyers  and light cruisers. The deciding test of a submarine's power in this  respect was the fruitless attempts of the best German submarines to  reach the _Lion_ with a deathblow, when crippled, after the battle  off Dogger Bank, she was being towed home at 5 knots an hour, under  the protection of the destroyers.    However, any isolated vessel, whether a merchantman or a man-of-war,  is at the mercy of a submarine, which hunts the seas for this kind  of target. It has only to lie in wait on the trade routes until its  prey appears, submerging in case of danger. Then a torpedo sent home  and a valuable piece of property goes to the bottom of the sea. What  resourceful brigandage is to traffic on the highways, the German  submarine became to British traffic on the seas. It is the sniper of  naval warfare, but cannot give battle. It must find its protection  under the sea, while all freight and all passengers, all the world's  business is done on the surface of the sea; and the great guns of  the dreadnoughts command the surface.    [Illustration: George V, King of Great Britain and Emperor of  India.]    When brigandage becomes highly organized, it means enormous expense  in increased police work, particularly if you cannot trail the  brigands to their hiding places and force them to capitulate. In  this case the brigands' hiding places are under the protection of  powerful fortress guns and mine fields in secure harbors.    The British navy, with over three thousand ships, including mine  sweepers and auxiliaries of all sorts under Sir John Jellicoe's  command, was forced to go to immense expense and pains in combating  the submarine campaign. Many submarines were taken; but the Germans  kept on building them. It was a war against an unseen and cunning  foe, which required ceaseless vigilance and painstaking effort. The  amount of material, as well as the amount of ships required in order  to combat the submarines and also to keep the patrol intact from the  British channel to Iceland, could it be enumerated,"]]]
