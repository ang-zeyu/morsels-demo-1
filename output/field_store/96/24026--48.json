OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Vibhuti Yog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections.\"            CHAPTER XI        Arjuna.    This, for my soul's peace, have I heard from Thee,    The unfolding of the Mystery Supreme    Named Adhyatman; comprehending which,    My darkness is dispelled; for now I know--    O Lotus-eyed![FN#21]--whence is the birth of men,    And whence their death, and what the majesties    Of Thine immortal rule. Fain would I see,    As thou Thyself declar'st it, Sovereign Lord!    The likeness of that glory of Thy Form    Wholly revealed. O Thou Divinest One!    If this can be, if I may bear the sight,    Make Thyself visible, Lord of all prayers!    Show me Thy very self, the Eternal God!      Krishna.    Gaze, then, thou Son of Pritha! I manifest for thee    Those hundred thousand thousand shapes that clothe my Mystery:    I show thee all my semblances, infinite, rich, divine,    My changeful hues, my countless forms. See! in this face of mine,    Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Aswins, and Maruts; see    Wonders unnumbered, Indian Prince! revealed to none save thee.    Behold! this is the Universe!--Look! what is live and dead    I gather all in one--in Me! Gaze, as thy lips have said,    On GOD ETERNAL, VERY GOD! See Me! see what thou prayest!      Thou canst not!--nor, with human eyes, Arjuna! ever mayest!    Therefore I give thee sense divine. Have other eyes, new light!    And, look! This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight!      Sanjaya.    Then, O King! the God, so saying,    Stood, to Pritha's Son displaying    All the splendour, wonder, dread    Of His vast Almighty-head.    Out of countless eyes beholding,    Out of countless mouths commanding,    Countless mystic forms enfolding    In one Form: supremely standing    Countless radiant glories wearing,    Countless heavenly weapons bearing,    Crowned with garlands of star-clusters,    Robed in garb of woven lustres,    Breathing from His perfect Presence    Breaths of every subtle essence    Of all heavenly odours; shedding    Blinding brilliance; overspreading--    Boundless, beautiful--all spaces    With His all-regarding faces;    So He showed! If there should rise    Suddenly within the skies    Sunburst of a thousand suns    Flooding earth with beams undeemed-of,    Then might be that Holy One's    Majesty and radiance dreamed of!      So did Pandu's Son behold    All this universe enfold    All its huge diversity    Into one vast shape, and be    Visible, and viewed, and blended    In one Body--subtle, splendid,    Nameless--th' All-comprehending    God of Gods, the Never-Ending    Deity!      But, sore amazed,    Thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed,    Arjuna knelt; and bowed his head,    And clasped his palms; and cried, and said:      Arjuna.    Yea! I have seen! I see!    Lord! all is wrapped in Thee!    The gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures    Of earth, and heaven, and hell    In Thy Divine form dwell,    And in Thy countenance shine all the features      Of Brahma, sitting lone    Upon His lotus-throne;    Of saints and sages, and the serpent races    Ananta, Vasuki;    Yea! mightiest Lord! I see    Thy thousand thousand arms, and breasts, and faces,    And eyes,--on every side    Perfect, diversified;    And nowhere end of Thee, nowhere beginning,    Nowhere a centre! Shifts--    Wherever soul's gaze lifts--    Thy central Self, all-wielding, and all-winning!      Infinite King! I see    The anadem on Thee,    The club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning    In beams insufferable,    Lighting earth, heaven, and hell    With brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning      Darkness to dazzling day,    Look I whichever way;    Ah, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided,    The Uttermost of thought,    The Treasure-Palace wrought    To hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided      To shelter Virtue's laws;    The Fount whence Life's stream draws    All waters of all rivers of all being:    The One Unborn, Unending:    Unchanging and Unblending!    With might and majesty, past thought, past seeing!      Silver of moon and gold    Of sun are glories rolled    From Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender    Throughout the stars and skies,    Doth to warm life surprise    Thy Universe. The worlds are filled with wonder      Of Thy perfections! Space    Star-sprinkled, and void place    From pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound,    Hath Thee in every spot,    Thee, Thee!--Where Thou art not,    O Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found!      O Mystic, Awful One!    At sight of Thee, made known,    The Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee;    They fold their palms, and bow    Body, and breast, and brow,    And, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee!      Rishis and Siddhas cry    \"Hail! Highest Majesty!\"    From sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory    In dulcet harmony,    Sounding the praise of Thee;    While countless companies take up the story,      Rudras, who ride the storms,    Th' Adityas' shining forms,    Vasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas;    Maruts, and those great Twins    The heavenly, fair, Aswins,    Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,[FN#22]--      These see Thee, and revere    In sudden-stricken fear;    Yea! the Worlds,--seeing Thee with form stupendous,    With faces manifold,    With eyes which all behold,    Unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous,      Flanks, lit with sun and star,    Feet planted near and far,    Tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;--    The Three wide Worlds before Thee    Adore, as I adore Thee,    Quake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour!      I mark Thee strike the skies    With front, in wondrous wise    Huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth    Opened, and orbs which see    All things, whatever be    In all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south.      O Eyes of God! O Head!    My strength of soul is fled,    Gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire!    When I behold Thee so,    With awful brows a-glow,    With burning glance, and lips lighted by fire      Fierce as those flames which shall    Consume, at close of all,    Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!    Thee, Lord of Lords! I see,    Thee only-only Thee!    Now let Thy mercy unto me be given,      Thou Refuge of the World!    Lo! to the cavern hurled    Of Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,    I see our noblest ones,    Great Dhritarashtra's sons,    Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!      The Kings and Chiefs drawn in,    That gaping gorge within;    The best of both these armies torn and riven!    Between Thy jaws they lie    Mangled full bloodily,    Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven      With helpless haste, which go    In headlong furious flow    Straight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean,    So to that flaming cave    Those heroes great and brave    Pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!      Like moths which in the night    Flutter towards a light,    Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,    So to their death still throng,    Blind, dazzled, borne along    Ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying!      Thou, that hast fashioned men,    Devourest them again,    One with another, great and small, alike!    The creatures whom Thou mak'st,    With flaming jaws Thou tak'st,    Lapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike      From end to end of earth,    Filling life full, from birth    To death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!    Ah, Vishnu! make me know    Why is Thy visage so?    Who art Thou, feasting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#8)"],[1," letup of pressure caused by the Doctor's menacing  gesture toward the unhappy woman--Bruce's long-sleeping soul awoke. He  answered the cry and the man's blow at his deity in the immemorial  fashion of all dogs whose human gods are threatened.    There was a snarling wild-beast growl, the first that ever had come  from the clownlike puppy's throat,--and Bruce flung his unwieldy young  body straight for the vivisector's throat.    Halding, with a vicious fist-lunge, sent the pup to the floor of the  car in a crumpled heap, but not before the curving white eyeteeth had  slashed the side of the man's throat in an ugly flesh-wound that drove  its way dangerously close to the jugular.    Half stunned by the blow, and with the breath knocked out of him, Bruce  none the less gathered himself together with lightning speed and  launched his bulk once more for Halding's throat.    This time he missed his mark--for several things happened all at once.    At the dog's first onslaught, Halding's foot had swung forward, along  with his fist, in an instinctive kick. The kick did not reach Bruce.  But it landed, full and effectively, on the accelerator.    The powerful car responded to the touch with a bound. And it did so at  the very moment that the flash of white teeth at his throat made  Halding snatch his own left hand instinctively from the steering-wheel,  in order to guard the threatened spot.    A second later the runabout crashed at full speed into the wall of a  house on the narrow street's opposite side.    The rest was chaos.    When a crowd of idlers and a policeman at last righted the wrecked car,  two bodies were found huddled inertly amid a junk-heap of splintered  glass and shivered wood and twisted metal. The local ambulance carried  away one of these limp bodies. The Place's car rushed the smash-up's  other senseless victim to the office of the nearest veterinary. Dr.  Halding, with a shattered shoulder-blade and a fractured nose and jaw  and a mild case of brain-concussion,--was received as a guest of honor  at the village hospital.    Bruce, his left foreleg broken and a nasty assortment of glass-cuts  marring the fluffiness of his fur, was skillfully patched up by the  vet' and carried back that night to The Place.    The puppy had suddenly taken on a new value in his owners' eyes--partly  for his gallantly puny effort at defending the Mistress, partly because  of his pitiful condition. And he was nursed, right zealously, back to  life and health.    In a few weeks, the plaster cast on the convalescent's broken foreleg  had been replaced by a bandage. In another week or two the vet'  pronounced Bruce as well as ever. The dog, through habit, still held  the mended foreleg off the ground, even after the bandage was removed.  Whereat, the Master tied a bandage tightly about the uninjured foreleg.    Bruce at once decided that this, and not the other, was the lame leg;  and he began forthwith to limp on it. As it was manifestly impossible  to keep both forelegs off the ground at the same time when he was  walking, he was forced to make use of the once-broken leg. Finding, to  his amaze, that he could walk on it with perfect ease, he devoted his  limping solely to the well leg. And as soon as the Master took the  bandage from that, Bruce ceased to limp at all.    Meanwhile, a lawyer, whose name sounded as though it had been culled  from a Rhine Wine list, had begun suit, in Dr. Halding's name, against  the Mistress, as a \"contributory cause\" of his client's accident. The  suit never came to trial. It was dropped, indeed, with much haste. Not  from any change of heart on the plaintiff's behalf; but because, at  that juncture, Dr. Halding chanced to be arrested and interned as a  dangerous Enemy Alien. Our country had recently declared war on  Germany; and the belated spy-hunt was up.    During the Federal officers' search of the doctor's house, for  treasonable documents (of which they found an ample supply), they came  upon his laboratory. No fewer than five dogs, in varying stages of  hideous torture, were found strapped to tables or hanging to  wall-hooks. The vivisector bewailed, loudly and gutturally, this cruel  interruption to his researches in Science's behalf.    One day, two months after the accident, Bruce stood on all four feet  once more, with no vestige left of scars or of lameness. And then, for  the first time, a steady change that had been so slow as to escape any  one's notice dawned upon the Mistress and the Master. It struck them  both at the same moment. And they stared dully at their pet.    The shapeless, bumptious, foolish Pest of two months ago had vanished.  In his place, by a very normal process of nature-magic, stood a  magnificently stately thoroughbred collie.    The big head had tapered symmetrically, and had lost its puppy  formlessness. It was now a head worthy of Landseer's own pencil. The  bonily awkward body had lengthened and had lost its myriad knobs and  angles. It had grown massively graceful.    The former thatch of half-curly and indeterminately yellowish fuzz had  changed to a rough tawny coat, wavy and unbelievably heavy, stippled at  the ends with glossy black. There was a strange depth and repose and  Soul in the dark eyes--yes, and a keen intelligence, too.    It was the old story of the Ugly Duckling, all over again.    \"Why!\" gasped the Mistress. \"He's--he's BEAUTIFUL! And I never knew it.\"    At her loved voice the great dog moved across to where she sat. Lightly  he laid one little white paw on her knee and looked gravely up into her  eyes.    \"He's got sense, too,\" chimed in the Master. \"Look at those eyes, if  you doubt it. They're alive with intelligence. It's--it's a miracle! He  can't be the same worthless whelp I wanted to get rid of! He CAN'T!\"    And he was not. The long illness, at the most formative time of the  dog's growth, had done its work in developing what, all the time, had  lain latent. The same illness--and the long-enforced personal touch  with humans--had done an equally transforming work on the puppy's  undeveloped mind. The Thackeray-Washington-Lincoln-Bismarck simile had  held good.    What looked like a miracle was no more than the same beautifully simple  process which Nature enacts every day, when she changes an awkward and  dirt-colored cygnet into a glorious swan or a leggily gawky colt into a  superb Derby-winner. But Bruce's metamorphosis seemed none the less  wonderful in the eyes of the two people who had learned to love him.    Somewhere in the hideous wreck of Dr. Halding's motorcar the dog had  found a soul--and the rest had followed as a natural course of growth.    At the autumn dog-show, in Hampton, a \"dark-sable-and-white\" collie of  unwonted size and beauty walked proudly into the ring close to the  Mistress's side, when the puppy class was called--a class that includes  all dogs under twelve months old. Six minutes later the Mistress was  gleesomely accepting the first-prize blue ribbon, for \"best puppy,\"  from Judge Symonds' own gnarled hand.    Then came the other classes for collies--\"Novice,\" \"Open,\" \"Limit,\"  \"Local,\" \"American Bred.\" And as Bruce paced majestically out of the  ring at last, he was the possessor of five more blue ribbons--as well  as the blue Winner's rosette, for \"best collie in the show.\"    \"Great dog you've got there, madam!\" commented Symonds in solemn  approval as he handed the Winner's rosette to the Mistress. \"Fine dog  in every way. Fine promise. He will go far. One of the best types  I've--\"    \"Do you really think so?\" sweetly replied the Mistress. \"Why, one of  the foremost collie judges in America has gone on record as calling him  a 'measly St. Bernard monstrosity.'\"    \"No?\" snorted Symonds, incredulous. \"You don't say so! A judge who  would speak so, of that dog, doesn't understand his business. He--\"    \"Oh, yes, he does!\" contradicted the Mistress, glancing lovingly at her  handful of blue ribbons. \"I think he understands his business very well  indeed--NOW!\"        CHAPTER III. The War Dog    The guest had decided to wait until next morning, before leaving The  Place, instead of following his first plan of taking a night train to  New York. He was a captain in our regular army and had newly come back  from France to forget an assortment of shrapnel-bites and to teach  practical tactics to rookies.    He reached his decision to remain over night at The Place while he and  the Mistress and the Master were sitting on the vine-hung west veranda  after dinner, watching the flood of sunset change the lake to molten  gold and the sky to pink fire. It would be pleasant to steal another  few hours at this back-country House of Peace before returning to the  humdrum duties of camp. And the guest yielded to the temptation.    \"I'm mighty glad you can stay over till morning,\" said the Master.  \"I'll send word to Roberts not to bring up the car.\"    As he spoke, he scrawled a penciled line on an envelope-back; then he  whistled.    From a cool lounging-place beneath the wistaria-vines arose a huge  collie--stately of form, dark brown and white of coat, deep-set of eye  and with a head that somehow reminded one of a Landseer engraving. The  collie trotted up the steps of the veranda and stood expectant before  the Master. The latter had been folding the envelope lengthwise. Now he  slipped it through the ring in the dog's collar.    \"Give it to Roberts,\" he said.    The big collie turned and set off at a hand-gallop.    \"Good!\" approved the guest. \"Bruce didn't seem to be in any doubt as to  what you wanted him to do. He knows where Roberts is likely to be?\"    \"No,\" said the Master. \"But he can track him and find him, if Roberts  is anywhere within a mile or so from here. That was one of the first  things we taught him--to carry messages. All we do is to slip the paper  into his collar-ring and tell him the name of the person to take it to.  Naturally, he knows us all by name. So it is"]]]
