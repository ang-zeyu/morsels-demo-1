[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#8)"],[1," one was  struck by the meagre English of merchandisers and the poor verbal  resources of commerce generally. A while ago business dealt hardly with  the word \"proposition.\" It was the universal noun. Everything that  business touched, however remotely, was a \"proposition.\" When last he  was \"outside\" the writer heard the Nicene creed described as a \"tough  proposition\"; the Vice-President of the United States as a \"cold-blooded  proposition,\" and missionaries in Alaska generally as \"queer  propositions.\" Now commerce has discovered and appropriated the word  \"product\" and is working it for all it is worth. The coffee in the can  calls itself a product. The compressed medicines from London direct you  to \"dissolve one product\" in so much water; the vacuum bottles inform  you that since they are a \"glass product\" they will not guarantee  themselves against breakage; the tea tablets and the condensed pea soup  affirm the purity of \"these products\"; the powdered milk is a little  more explicit and calls itself a \"food product.\" One feels disposed to  agree with Humpty Dumpty, in \"Through the Looking-Glass,\" that when a  word is worked as hard as this it ought to be paid extra. One feels that  \"product\" ought to be coming round on Saturday night to collect its  overtime. The zwieback amuses one; it is a West-coast \"product,\" and  apparently \"product\" has not yet reached the West coast--it does not so  dignify itself. But it urges one, in great letters on every package, to  \"save the end seals; they are valuable!\" Walter finds that by gathering  one thousand two hundred of these seals he would be entitled to a  \"rolled-gold\" watch absolutely free! This zwieback was the whole stock  of a Yukon grocer purchased when the supply we ordered did not arrive.  The writer was reminded of the time when he bought several two-pound  packages of rolled oats at a little Yukon store and discovered to his  disgust that every package contained a china cup and saucer that must  have weighed at least a pound. One can understand the poor Indian being  thus deluded into the belief that he is getting his crockery for  nothing, but it is hard to understand how the \"gift-enterprise\" and  \"premium-package\" folly still survives amongst white people--and Indians  do not eat zwieback. What sort of people are they who will feverishly  purchase and consume one thousand two hundred packages of zwieback in  order to get a \"rolled-gold\" watch for nothing? A sack of corn-meal  takes one's eye mainly by the enumeration of the formidable processes  which the \"product\" inside has survived. It is announced proudly as  \"degerminated, granulated, double kiln-dried, steam-ground\"! But why, in  the name even of an adulterous and adulterating generation, should rice  be \"coated with talcum and glucose,\" as this sack unblushingly  confesses? It is all very well to add \"remove by washing\"; that is  precisely what we shall be unable to do. It will take all the time and  fuel we have to spare to melt snow for cooking, when one little primus  stove serves for all purposes. When we leave this camp there will be no  more water for the toilet; we shall have to cleanse our hands with snow  and let our faces go. The rice will enter the pot unwashed and will  transfer its talcum and glucose to our intestines. Nor is this the case  merely on exceptional mountain-climbing expeditions; it is the general  rule during the winter throughout Alaska. It takes a long time and a  great deal of snow and much wood to produce a pot of water on the winter  trail. That \"talcum-and-glucose\" abomination should be taken up by the  Pure Food Law authorities. All the rice that comes to Alaska is so  labelled. The stomachs and bowels of dogs and men in the country are  doubtless gradually becoming \"coated with talcum and glucose.\"    [Sidenote: Sugar]    It was during this period of hope deferred that we began to be entirely  without sugar. Perhaps by the ordinary man anywhere, certainly by the  ordinary man in Alaska, where it is the rule to include as much sugar as  flour in an outfit, deprivation of sugar is felt more keenly than  deprivation of any other article of food. We watched the gradual  dwindling of our little sack, replenished from the base camp with the  few pounds we had reserved for our return journey, with sinking hearts.  It was kept solely for tea and coffee. We put no more in the sour dough  for hot cakes; we ceased its use on our rice for breakfast; we gave up  all sweet messes. Tatum attempted a pudding without sugar, putting  vanilla and cinnamon and one knows not what other flavorings in it, in  the hope of disguising the absence of sweetness, but no one could eat it  and there was much jeering at the cook. Still it dwindled and dwindled.  Two spoonfuls to a cup were reduced by common consent to one, and still  it went, until at last the day came when there was no more. Our cocoa  became useless--we could not drink it without sugar; our consumption of  tea and coffee diminished--there was little demand for the second cup.  And we all began to long for sweet things. We tried to make a palatable  potation from some of our milk chocolate, reserved for the higher work  and labelled, \"For eating only.\" The label was accurate; it made a  miserable drink, the milk taste entirely lacking, the sweetness almost  gone. We speculated how our ancestors got on without sugar when it was a  high-priced luxury brought painfully in small quantities from the  Orient, and assured one another that it was not a necessary article of  diet. At last we all agreed to Karstens's laconic advice, \"Forget it!\"  and we spoke of sugar no more. When we got on the ridge the chocolate  satisfied to some extent the craving for sweetness, but we all missed  the sugar sorely and continued to miss it to the end, Karstens as much  as anybody else.    Our long detention here made us thankful for the large tent and the  plentiful wood supply. That wood had been hauled twenty miles and raised  nearly ten thousand feet, but it was worth while since it enabled us to  \"weather out the weather\" here in warmth and comparative comfort. The  wood no more than served our need; indeed, we had begun to economize  closely before we left this camp.    We were greatly interested and surprised at the intrusion of animal life  into these regions totally devoid of any vegetation. A rabbit followed  us up the glacier to an elevation of ten thousand feet, gnawing the bark  from the willow shoots with which the trail was staked, creeping round  the crevasses, and, in one place at least, leaping such a gap. At ten  thousand feet he turned back and descended, leaving his tracks plain in  the snow. We speculated as to what possible object he could have had,  and decided that he was migrating from the valley below, overstocked  with rabbits as it was, and had taken a wrong direction for his purpose.  Unless the ambition for first ascents have reached the leporidae, this  seems the only explanation.    At this camp at the head of the glacier we saw ptarmigan on several  occasions, and heard their unmistakable cry on several more, and once we  felt sure that a covey passed over the ridge above us and descended to  the other glacier. It was always in thick weather that these birds were  noticed at the glacier head, and we surmised that perhaps they had lost  their way in the cloud.    But even this was not the greatest height at which bird life was  encountered. In the Grand Basin, at sixteen thousand five hundred feet,  Walter was certain that he heard the twittering of small birds familiar  throughout the winter in Alaska, and this also was in the mist. I have  never known the boy make a mistake in such matters, and it is not  essentially improbable. Doctor Workman saw a pair of choughs at  twenty-one thousand feet, on Nun Kun in the Himalayas.    [Sidenote: Avalanches]    Our situation on the glacier floor, much of the time enveloped in dense  mist, was damp and cold and gloomy. The cliffs around from time to time  discharged their unstable snows in avalanches that threw clouds of snow  almost across the wide glacier. Often we could see nothing, and the  noise of the avalanches without the sight of them was at times a little  alarming. But the most notable discharges were those from the great  ice-fall, and the more important of them were startling and really very  grand sights. A slight movement would begin along the side of the ice,  in one of the gullies of the rock, a little trickling and rattling.  Gathering to itself volume as it descended, it started ice in other  gullies and presently there was a roar from the whole face of the  enormous hanging glacier, and the floor upon which the precipitation  descended trembled and shook with the impact of the discharge. Dense  volumes of snow and ice dust rose in clouds thousands of feet high and  slowly drifted down the glacier. We had chosen our camping-place to be  out of harm's way and were really quite safe. We never saw any large  masses detached, and by the time the ice reached the glacier floor it  was all reduced to dust and small fragments. One does not recall in the  reading of mountaineering books any account of so lofty an ice-fall.    [Illustration: Cutting a staircase three miles long in the ice of the  shattered ridge.]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] I have since learned that this mountain was named Mount Brooks by  Professor Parker, and so withdraw the suggested name.    [2] See frontispiece.          CHAPTER III    THE NORTHEAST RIDGE      Some of the photographs we succeeded in getting will show better than  any words the character of the ridge we had to climb to the upper basin  by. The lowest point of the ridge was that nearest our camp. To reach  its crest at that point, some three hundred feet above the glacier, was  comparatively easy, but when it was reached there stretched ahead of us  miles and miles of ice-blocks heaved in confusion, resting at insecure  angles,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#8)"],[1,"d, rising, \"I wonder if a bit  of lunch somewhere might not be a good thing? We have had an  interesting but fatiguing little chat. Our tissues require  restoring. If you gentlemen would care to join me--\"    Ten minutes later the company was seated in complete harmony round  a table at the Knickerbocker. Psmith, with the dignified bonhomie  of a seigneur of the old school, was ordering the wine; while B.  Henderson Asher, brimming over with good-humour, was relating to an  attentive circle an anecdote which should have appeared in his next  instalment of \"Moments of Mirth.\"        CHAPTER IX    FULL STEAM AHEAD    When Psmith returned to the office, he found Billy Windsor in the  doorway, just parting from a thick-set young man, who seemed to be  expressing his gratitude to the editor for some good turn. He was  shaking him warmly by the hand.    Psmith stood aside to let him pass.    \"An old college chum, Comrade Windsor?\" he asked.    \"That was Kid Brady.\"    \"The name is unfamiliar to me. Another contributor?\"    \"He's from my part of the country--Wyoming. He wants to fight any  one in the world at a hundred and thirty-three pounds.\"    \"We all have our hobbies. Comrade Brady appears to have selected a  somewhat exciting one. He would find stamp-collecting less  exacting.\"    \"It hasn't given him much excitement so far, poor chap,\" said Billy  Windsor. \"He's in the championship class, and here he has been  pottering about New York for a month without being able to get a  fight. It's always the way in this rotten East,\" continued Billy,  warming up as was his custom when discussing a case of oppression  and injustice. \"It's all graft here. You've got to let half a dozen  brutes dip into every dollar you earn, or you don't get a chance.  If the kid had a manager, he'd get all the fights he wanted. And  the manager would get nearly all the money. I've told him that we  will back him up.\"    \"You have hit it, Comrade Windsor,\" said Psmith with enthusiasm.  \"_Cosy Moments_ shall be Comrade Brady's manager. We will give him a  much-needed boost up in our columns. A sporting section is what the  paper requires more than anything.\"    \"If things go on as they've started, what it will require still  more will be a fighting-editor. Pugsy tells me you had visitors  while I was out.\"    \"A few,\" said Psmith. \"One or two very entertaining fellows.  Comrades Asher, Philpotts, and others. I have just been giving them  a bite of lunch at the Knickerbocker.\"    \"Lunch!\"    \"A most pleasant little lunch. We are now as brothers. I fear I  have made you perhaps a shade unpopular with our late contributors;  but these things must be. We must clench our teeth and face them  manfully. If I were you, I think I should not drop in at the house  of Comrade Asher and the rest to take pot-luck for some little time  to come. In order to soothe the squad I was compelled to curse you  to some extent.\"    \"Don't mind me.\"    \"I think I may say I didn't.\"    \"Say, look here, you must charge up the price of that lunch to the  office. Necessary expenses, you know.\"    \"I could not dream of doing such a thing, Comrade Windsor. The  whole affair was a great treat to me. I have few pleasures. Comrade  Asher alone was worth the money. I found his society intensely  interesting. I have always believed in the Darwinian theory.  Comrade Asher confirmed my views.\"    They went into the inner office. Psmith removed his hat and coat.    \"And now once more to work,\" he said. \"Psmith the _flaneur_ of Fifth  Avenue ceases to exist. In his place we find Psmith the hard-headed  sub-editor. Be so good as to indicate a job of work for me,  Comrade Windsor. I am champing at my bit.\"    Billy Windsor sat down, and lit his pipe.    \"What we want most,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is some big topic.  That's the only way to get a paper going. Look at _Everybody's  Magazine_. They didn't amount to a row of beans till Lawson started  his 'Frenzied Finance' articles. Directly they began, the whole  country was squealing for copies. _Everybody's_ put up their price  from ten to fifteen cents, and now they lead the field.\"    \"The country must squeal for _Cosy Moments_,\" said Psmith firmly. \"I  fancy I have a scheme which may not prove wholly scaly. Wandering  yesterday with Comrade Jackson in a search for Fourth Avenue, I  happened upon a spot called Pleasant Street. Do you know it?\"    Billy Windsor nodded.    \"I went down there once or twice when I was a reporter. It's a  beastly place.\"    \"It is a singularly beastly place. We went into one of the houses.\"    \"They're pretty bad.\"    \"Who owns them?\"    \"I don't know. Probably some millionaire. Those tenement houses  are about as paying an investment as you can have.\"    \"Hasn't anybody ever tried to do anything about them?\"    \"Not so far as I know. It's pretty difficult to get at these  fellows, you see. But they're fierce, aren't they, those houses!\"    \"What,\" asked Psmith, \"is the precise difficulty of getting at  these merchants?\"    \"Well, it's this way. There are all sorts of laws about the places,  but any one who wants can get round them as easy as falling off a  log. The law says a tenement house is a building occupied by more  than two families. Well, when there's a fuss, all the man has to do  is to clear out all the families but two. Then, when the inspector  fellow comes along, and says, let's say, 'Where's your running  water on each floor? That's what the law says you've got to have,  and here are these people having to go downstairs and out of doors  to fetch their water supplies,' the landlord simply replies,  'Nothing doing. This isn't a tenement house at all. There are only  two families here.' And when the fuss has blown over, back come the  rest of the crowd, and things go on the same as before.\"    \"I see,\" said Psmith. \"A very cheery scheme.\"    \"Then there's another thing. You can't get hold of the man who's  really responsible, unless you're prepared to spend thousands  ferreting out evidence. The land belongs in the first place to some  corporation or other. They lease it to a lessee. When there's a  fuss, they say they aren't responsible, it's up to the lessee. And  he lies so low that you can't find out who he is. It's all just  like the East. Everything in the East is as crooked as Pearl  Street. If you want a square deal, you've got to come out Wyoming  way.\"    \"The main problem, then,\" said Psmith, \"appears to be the discovery  of the lessee, lad? Surely a powerful organ like _Cosy Moments_, with  its vast ramifications, could bring off a thing like that?\"    \"I doubt it. We'll try, anyway. There's no knowing but what we may  have luck.\"    \"Precisely,\" said Psmith. \"Full steam ahead, and trust to luck. The  chances are that, if we go on long enough, we shall eventually  arrive somewhere. After all, Columbus didn't know that America  existed when he set out. All he knew was some highly interesting  fact about an egg. What that was, I do not at the moment recall,  but it bucked Columbus up like a tonic. It made him fizz ahead like  a two-year-old. The facts which will nerve us to effort are two. In  the first place, we know that there must be some one at the bottom  of the business. Secondly, as there appears to be no law of libel  whatsoever in this great and free country, we shall be enabled to  haul up our slacks with a considerable absence of restraint.\"    \"Sure,\" said Billy Windsor. \"Which of us is going to write the  first article?\"    \"You may leave it to me, Comrade Windsor. I am no hardened old  journalist, I fear, but I have certain qualifications for the post.  A young man once called at the office of a certain newspaper, and  asked for a job. 'Have you any special line?' asked the editor.  'Yes,' said the bright lad, 'I am rather good at invective.' 'Any  special kind of invective?' queried the man up top. 'No,' replied  our hero, 'just general invective.' Such is my own case, Comrade  Windsor. I am a very fair purveyor of good, general invective. And  as my visit to Pleasant Street is of such recent date, I am  tolerably full of my subject. Taking full advantage of the  benevolent laws of this country governing libel, I fancy I will  produce a screed which will make this anonymous lessee feel as if  he had inadvertently seated himself upon a tin-tack. Give me pen  and paper, Comrade Windsor, instruct Comrade Maloney to suspend his  whistling till such time as I am better able to listen to it; and I  think we have got a success.\"        CHAPTER X    GOING SOME    There was once an editor of a paper in the Far West who was sitting  at his desk, musing pleasantly of life, when a bullet crashed  through the window and embedded itself in the wall at the back of  his head. A happy smile lit up the editor's face. \"Ah,\" he said  complacently, \"I knew that Personal column of ours was going to be  a success!\"    What the bullet was to the Far West editor, the visit of Mr.  Francis Parker to the offices of _Cosy Moments_ was to Billy Windsor.    It occurred in the third week of the new _regime_ of the paper.  _Cosy Moments_, under its new management, had bounded ahead like a  motor-car when the throttle is opened. Incessant work had been the  order of the day. Billy Windsor's hair had become more dishevelled  than ever, and even Psmith had at moments lost a certain amount of  his dignified calm. Sandwiched in between the painful case of Kid  Brady and the matter of the tenements, which formed the star items  of the paper's contents, was a mass of bright reading dealing with  the events of the day. Billy Windsor's newspaper friends had turned  in some fine, snappy stuff in their best Yellow Journal manner,  relating to the more stirring happenings in the city. Psmith, who  had constituted himself guardian of the literary and dramatic  interests of the paper, had employed his gift of general invective  to considerable effect, as was shown by a conversation between  Master Maloney and "]]]
