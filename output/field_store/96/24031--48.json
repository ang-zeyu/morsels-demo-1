A  heavy storm was impending; big drops fell in showers from the forest  trees as they groaned under the blast, and beneath the gloomy avenue the  clayey ground gleamed ghastly white. As the Raja and his son advanced,  a faint ray of light, like the line of pure gold streaking the dark  surface of the touchstone, caught their eyes, and directed their  footsteps towards the cemetery.    When Vikram came upon the open space on the riverbank where corpses were  burned, he hesitated for a moment to tread its impure ground. But seeing  his son undismayed, he advanced boldly, trampling upon remnants of  bones, and only covering his mouth with his turband-end.    Presently, at the further extremity of the smashana, or burning ground,  appeared a group. By the lurid flames that flared and flickered round  the half-extinguished funeral pyres, with remnants of their dreadful  loads, Raja Vikram and Dharma Dhwaj could note the several features of  the ill-omened spot. There was an outer circle of hideous bestial forms;  tigers were roaring, and elephants were trumpeting; wolves, whose  foul hairy coats blazed with sparks of bluish phosphoric light, were  devouring the remnants of human bodies; foxes, jackals, and hyenas  were disputing over their prey; whilst bears were chewing the livers of  children. The space within was peopled by a multitude of fiends. There  were the subtle bodies of men that had escaped their grosser frames  prowling about the charnel ground, where their corpses had been reduced  to ashes, or hovering in the air, waiting till the new bodies which  they were to animate were made ready for their reception. The spirits of  those that had been foully slain wandered about with gashed limbs; and  skeletons, whose mouldy bones were held together by bits of blackened  sinew, followed them as the murderer does his victim. Malignant witches  with shriveled skins, horrid eyes and distorted forms, crawled  and crouched over the earth; whilst spectres and goblins now stood  motionless, and tall as lofty palm trees; then, as if in fits, leaped,  danced, and tumbled before their evocator. The air was filled with  shrill and strident cries, with the fitful moaning of the storm-wind,  with the hooting of the owl, with the jackal's long wild cry, and  with the hoarse gurgling of the swollen river, from whose banks the  earth-slip thundered in its fall.    In the midst of all, close to the fire which lit up his evil  countenance, sat Shanta-Shil, the jogi, with the banner that denoted  his calling and his magic staff planted in the ground behind him. He  was clad in the ochre-coloured loin-wrap of his class; from his head  streamed long tangled locks of hair like horsehair; his black body was  striped with lines of chalk, and a girdle of thighbones encircled his  waist. His face was smeared with ashes from a funeral pyre, and his  eyes, fixed as those of a statue, gleamed from this mask with an  infernal light of hate. His cheeks were shaven, and he had not forgotten  to draw the horizontal sectarian mark. But this was of blood; and  Vikram, as he drew near saw that he was playing upon a human skull with  two shank bones, making music for the horrid revelry.    Now Raja Vikram, as has been shown by his encounter with Indra's  watchman, was a bold prince, and he was cautious as he was brave. The  sight of a human being in the midst of these terrors raised his mettle;  he determined to prove himself a hero, and feeling that the critical  moment was now come, he hoped to rid himself and his house forever of  the family curse that hovered over them.    For a moment he thought of the giant's words, \"And remember that it is  lawful and right to strike off his head that would slay thee.\" A stroke  with his good sword might at once and effectually put an end to the  danger. But then he remembered that he had passed his royal word to do  the devotee's bidding that night. Besides, he felt assured that the hour  for action had not yet sounded.    These reflections having passed through his mind with the rapid course  of a star that has lost its honours,[40] Vikram courteously saluted  Shanta-Shil. The jogi briefly replied, \"Come sit down, both of ye.\" The  father and son took their places, by no means surprised or frightened  by the devil dances before and around them. Presently the valiant Raja  reminded the devotee that he was come to perform his promise, and lastly  asked, \"What commands are there for us?\"    The jogi replied, \"O king, since you have come, just perform one piece  of business. About two kos[41] hence, in a southerly direction, there  is another place where dead bodies are burned; and in that place is a  mimosa tree, on which a body is hanging. Bring it to me immediately.\"    Raja Vikram took his son's hand, unwilling to leave him in such  company; and, catching up a fire-brand, went rapidly away in the proper  direction. He was now certain that Shanta-Shil was the anchorite who,  enraged by his father, had resolved his destruction; and his uppermost  thought was a firm resolve \"to breakfast upon his enemy, ere his enemy  could dine upon him.\" He muttered this old saying as he went, whilst the  tom-toming of the anchorite upon the skull resounded in his ears,  and the devil-crowd, which had held its peace during his meeting with  Shanta-Shil, broke out again in an infernal din of whoops and screams,  yells and laughter.    The darkness of the night was frightful, the gloom deepened till it was  hardly possible to walk. The clouds opened their fountains, raining so  that you would say they could never rain again. Lightning blazed forth  with more than the light of day, and the roar of the thunder caused the  earth to shake. Baleful gleams tipped the black cones of the trees and  fitfully scampered like fireflies over the waste. Unclean goblins dogged  the travellers and threw themselves upon the ground in their path and  obstructed them in a thousand different ways. Huge snakes, whose mouths  distilled blood and black venom, kept clinging around their legs in the  roughest part of the road, till they were persuaded to loose their hold  either by the sword or by reciting a spell. In fact, there were so many  horrors and such a tumult and noise that even a brave man would have  faltered, yet the king kept on his way.    At length having passed over, somehow or other, a very difficult road,  the Raja arrived at the smashana, or burning place pointed out by the  jogi. Suddenly he sighted the tree where from root to top every branch  and leaf was in a blaze of crimson flame. And when he, still dauntless,  advanced towards it, a clamour continued to be raised, and voices kept  crying, \"Kill them! kill them! seize them! seize them! take care that  they do not get away! let them scorch themselves to cinders! let them  suffer the pains of Patala.[42]\"    Far from being terrified by this state of things the valiant Raja  increased in boldness, seeing a prospect of an end to his adventure.  Approaching the tree he felt that the fire did not burn him, and so he  sat there for a while to observe the body, which hung, head downwards,  from a branch a little above him.    Its eyes, which were wide open, were of a greenish-brown, and never  twinkled; its hair also was brown,[43] and brown was its face--three  several shades which, notwithstanding, approached one another in an  unpleasant way, as in an over-dried cocoa-nut. Its body was thin and  ribbed like a skeleton or a bamboo framework, and as it held on to a  bough, like a flying fox,[44] by the toe-tips, its drawn muscles stood  out as if they were ropes of coin. Blood it appeared to have none, or  there would have been a decided determination of that curious juice to  the head; and as the Raja handled its skin it felt icy cold and clammy  as might a snake. The only sign of life was the whisking of a ragged  little tail much resembling a goat's.    Judging from these signs the brave king at once determined the creature  to be a Baital--a Vampire. For a short time he was puzzled to reconcile  the appearance with the words of the giant, who informed him that the  anchorite had hung the oilman's son to a tree. But soon he explained to  himself the difficulty, remembering the exceeding cunning of jogis  and other reverend men, and determining that his enemy, the better  to deceive him, had doubtless altered the shape and form of the young  oilman's body.    With this idea, Vikram was pleased, saying, \"My trouble has been  productive of fruit.\" Remained the task of carrying the Vampire to  Shanta-Shil the devotee. Having taken his sword, the Raja fearlessly  climbed the tree, and ordering his son to stand away from below,  clutched the Vampire's hair with one hand, and with the other struck  such a blow of the sword, that the bough was cut and the thing fell  heavily upon the ground. Immediately on falling it gnashed its teeth and  began to utter a loud wailing cry like the screams of an infant in pain.  Vikram having heard the sound of its lamentations, was pleased, and  began to say to himself, \"This devil must be alive.\" Then nimbly sliding  down the trunk, he made a captive of the body, and asked \"Who art thou?\"    Scarcely, however, had the words passed the royal lips, when the Vampire  slipped through the fingers like a worm, and uttering a loud shout  of laughter, rose in the air with its legs uppermost, and as before  suspended itself by its toes to another bough. And there it swung to and  fro, moved by the violence of its cachinnation.    \"Decidedly this is the young oilman!\" exclaimed the Raja, after he had  stood for a minute or two with mouth open, gazing upwards and wondering  what he should do next. Presently he directed Dharma Dhwaj not to lose  an instant in laying hands upon the thing when it next might touch the  ground, and then he again swarmed up the tree. Having reached his former  position, he once more seized the Baital's hair, and with all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#8)"],[1,"cause is known; and they may rest assured that this suffering, in nearly  every case, can be removed.    Sometimes a girl grows to the age of eighteen or twenty without having  her periodical changes. We have already said that this is not unusual in  some climates and in some families; so, as long as the general health is  good and the spirits cheerful,--always an important point,--it need  cause no anxiety. But if the health grow poor, and especially if there  be pains and weakness recurring monthly without discharge, then  something is wrong, and the doctor should be consulted.      HYSTERICS.    There is a disease of the nerves to which girls about the age of puberty  are very subject, particularly in the higher circles of society, where  their emotions are over-educated and their organization delicate. It is  called hysteria, and more commonly _hysterics_. Frequently it deceives  both doctor and friends, and is supposed to be some dangerous complaint.  Often it puts on the symptoms of epilepsy, or heart disease, or  consumption. We have witnessed the most frightful convulsions in girls  of fourteen or fifteen, which were brought on by this complaint.  Sometimes it injures the mind; and it should always receive prompt and  efficient attention, as it is always curable.    This disease is apt to produce a similar affection in other girls of the  same age who see the attacks. For this reason, hysterical girls should  not be sent to large schools, but cured at home. Often a strong mental  impression restores them. The anecdote is told of a celebrated surgeon  (Boerhaave) who was called to a female seminary where there was a number  of hysterical girls. He summoned them together, heated a number of iron  instruments before their eyes, and told them that the first one who had  a fit should be cauterized down the spine. They all recovered  immediately.      SECRET BAD HABITS.    We now approach a part of our subject which we would gladly omit, did  not constant experience admonish us of our duty to speak of it in no  uncertain tone. We refer to the disastrous consequences on soul and body  to which young girls expose themselves by exciting and indulging morbid  passions. Years ago, Miss Catherine E. Beecher sounded a note of warning  to the mothers of America on this secret vice, which leads their  daughters to the grave, the madhouse, or, worse yet, the brothel.    Gladly would we believe that her timely admonition had done away with  the necessity for its repetition. But though we believe such a habit is  more rare than many physicians suppose, it certainly exists to a degree  that demands attention. Surgeons have recently been forced to devise  painful operations to hinder young girls from thus ruining themselves;  and we must confess that, in its worst form, it is absolutely incurable.    The results of the constant nervous excitement which this habit produces  are bodily weakness, loss of memory, low spirits, distressing  nervousness, a capricious appetite, dislike of company and of study,  and finally, paralysis, imbecility, or insanity. Let it not be supposed  that there are many who suffer thus severely; but, on the other hand,  let it be clearly understood that any indulgence whatever in these evil  courses is attended with bad effects, especially because they create  impure desires and thoughts, which will prepare the girl to be a willing  victim to the arts of profligacy. There is no more solemn duty resting  on those who have the charge of young females than to protect them  against this vice.    But, it is exclaimed, is it not dangerous to tell them anything about  it? Such a course is unnecessary. Teach them that any handling of the  parts, any indecent language, any impure thought, is degrading and  hurtful. See that the servants, nurses, and companions with whom they  associate are not debased; and recommend scrupulous cleanliness.    If the habit is discovered, do not scold nor whip the child. It is  _often_ a result of disease, and induced by a disagreeable local  itching. Sometimes this is connected with a disorder of the womb, and  very frequently with worms in the bowels. Let the case be submitted to a  judicious, skilful medical adviser, and the girl will yet be saved. But  do not shut your eyes, and refuse to see this fact when it exists.  Mothers are too often unwilling to entertain for a moment the thought  that their daughters are addicted to such a vice, when it is only too  plain to the physician.      THE HYGIENE OF PUBERTY.    Concerning the maladies of puberty, we may broadly say, that if we are  obliged to have recourse to medicine, it is because we have neglected  hygiene. That the period requires assiduous care, we grant; but given  that care, drugs will be needless.    In a general way, we have already emphasized the danger of indolence and  the benefits of exercise or labor; the perils of exciting the emotions,  and the advantages of a placid disposition; the impropriety of premature  development, and the wisdom of simplicity and moderation. This is an old  story--a thrice-told tale. Let us go more into minutiae.    One of the most frequent causes of disease, about the age of puberty, is  _starvation_. Many a girl is starved to death. Food is given her, but  not of the right quality, or in insufficient quantity, or at improper  hours. The system is not nourished, and, becoming feeble, it is laid  open to the attacks of disease, and to no form of disease more readily  than to consumption.    To correct this, let the food be varied, simply prepared, and abundant.  Good fresh milk should be used daily, while tea and coffee should be  withheld. Fat meats and vegetable oils, generally disliked by girls at  this age, are exactly what they need; and were they partaken of more  freely, there would be less inquiry at the druggists for cod-liver oil.    A modern writer of eminence lays it down as one of the most common  causes of consumption in young people, that just at the age when their  physical system is undergoing such important changes, that invaluable  article of diet, _milk_, is generally dropped, and nothing equally rich  in nitrogen substituted in its place.    _Exercise_, whether as games, the skipping rope, croquet, walking,  dancing, riding, and calisthenics, or as regular labor, is highly  beneficial, especially when it leads one into the fresh air, the  sunshine, and the country. A particular kind of exercise is to be  recommended for those whose chests are narrow, whose shoulders stoop,  and who have a hereditary predisposition to consumption. If it is  systematically practised along with other means of health, we would  guarantee any child, no matter how many relatives have died of this  disease, against its invasion. It is voluntary inspiration. Nothing is  more simple. Let her stand erect, throw the shoulders well back, and the  hands behind; then let her slowly inhale pure air to the full capacity  of the lungs, and retain it a few seconds _by an increased effort_; then  it may be slowly exhaled. After one or two natural inspirations, let her  repeat the act, and so on for ten or fifteen minutes, twice daily. Not  only is this simple procedure a safeguard against consumption, but, in  the opinion of some learned physicians, it can even cure it when it has  already commenced.    At first the monthly loss of blood exhausts the system. Therefore,  plenty of food, plenty of rest, plenty of sleep, are required. That  ancient prejudice in favour of early rising should be discarded now, and  the girl should retire early, and if she will, should sleep late. Hard  study, care, or anxiety should be spared her. This is not the time for  rigid discipline.    _Clothing_ is a matter of importance, and, if we were at all sure of  attention, there is much we would say of it. The thought seriously  troubles us, that so long as women consent to deform themselves and  sacrifice their health to false ideas of beauty, it is almost hopeless  to urge their fitness for, and their right to a higher life than they  now enjoy. No educated painter or sculptor is ignorant of what the model  of female beauty is; no fashionable woman is content unless she departs  from it as far as possible.    Now beauty implies health, and ugliness of form is attained not only at  the expense of aesthetics, but of comfort. The custom of fastening  growing girls in tight corsets, of flattening their breasts with pads,  of distorting their feet in small high-heeled shoes, and of teaching  them to stoop and mince in gait, is calculated to disgust every observer  of good sense and taste, and, what is of more consequence, to render  these girls, when they become women, more liable to every species of  suffering connected with child-bearing.    The monthly change is the prelude to maternity. On its healthful  recurrence depends present comfort and future health; and not these  alone, but also happiness in marriage, easy child-beds, and the  constitution of children to a degree the thoughtless girl and even the  mature woman rarely understand. She, therefore, who neglects the due  care of her own condition, violates a duty owed to others as well as  herself. We would have mothers impress this on their daughters. Let no  mistaken modesty prevent them.    Especially at their commencement should the monthly changes be carefully  watched. The mother should prepare her daughter's mind betimes for such  an expected incident in her life, thus preventing a useless fright, or  the employment of injurious means to stop what the child may look upon  as an accident.    Nor should the maternal care cease here. Such tender sympathy should  exist on the one side, such trusting confidence on the other, that the  mother should acquaint herself with every detail of each recurring  period until the function is thoroughly established. She should inquire  into the duration of each epoch, the abundance of the discharge, the  presence"]]]
