Birds with whom the struggle for life is the sharpest seem to be more  prolific than those whose nest and young are exposed to fewer dangers.  The robin, the sparrow, the pewee, etc., will rear, or make the attempt  to rear, two and sometimes three broods in a season; but the bobolink,  the oriole, the kingbird, the goldfinch, the cedar-bird, the birds of  prey, and the woodpeckers, that build in safe retreats, in the trunks  of trees, have usually but a single brood. If the boblink reared two  broods, our meadows would swarm with them.    I noted three nests of the cedar-bird in August in a single orchard,  all productive, but all with one or more unfruitful eggs in them. The  cedar-bird is the most silent of our birds having but a single fine  note, so far as I have observed, but its manners are very expressive at  times. No bird known to me is capable of expressing so much silent alarm  while on the nest as this bird. As you ascend the tree and draw near it,  it depresses its plumage and crest, stretches up its neck, and becomes  the very picture of fear. Other birds, under like circumstances, hardly  change their expression at all till they launch into the air, when by  their voice they express anger rather than alarm.    I have referred to the red squirrel as a destroyer of the eggs and young  of birds. I think the mischief it does in this respect can hardly be  over estimated. Nearly all birds look upon it as their enemy, and attack  and annoy it when it appears near their breeding haunts. Thus, I have  seen the pewee, the cuckoo, the robin, and the wood-thrush pursuing it  with angry voice and gestures. A friend of mine saw a pair of robins  attack one in the top of a tall tree so vigorously that they caused it  to lose its hold, when it fell to the ground, and was so stunned by the  blow as to allow him to pick it up. If you wish the birds to breed and  thrive in your orchard and groves, kill every red squirrel that infests  the place; kill every weasel also. The weasel is a subtle and arch enemy  of the birds. It climbs trees and explores them with great ease and  nimbleness. I have seen it do so on several occasions. One day my  attention was arrested by the angry notes of a pair of brown-thrashers  that were flitting from bush to bush along an old stone row in a remote  field. Presently I saw what it was that excited them--three large red  weasels, or ermines coming along the stone wall, and leisurely and half  playfully exploring every tree that stood near it. They had probably  robbed the thrashers. They would go up the trees with great ease, and  glide serpent-like out upon the main branches. When they descended the  tree they were unable to come straight down, like a squirrel, but went  around it spirally. How boldly they thrust their heads out of the wall,  and eyed me and sniffed me, as I drew near,--their round, thin ears,  their prominent, glistening, bead-like eyes, and the curving, snake-like  motions of the head and neck being very noticeable. They looked like  blood-suckers and egg-suckers. They suggested something extremely  remorseless and cruel. One could understand the alarm of the rats when  they discover one of these fearless, subtle, and circumventing creatures  threading their holes. To flee must be like trying to escape death  itself. I was one day standing in the woods upon a flat stone, in what  at certain seasons was the bed of a stream, when one of these weasels  came undulating along and ran under the stone upon which I was standing.  As I remained motionless, he thrust his wedge-shaped head, and turned it  back above the stone as if half in mind to seize my foot; then he drew  back, and presently went his way. These weasels often hunt in packs like  the British stoat. When I was a boy, my father one day armed me with  an old musket and sent me to shoot chipmunks around the corn. While  watching the squirrels, a troop of weasels tried to cross a bar-way  where I sat, and were so bent on doing it that I fired at them,  boy-like, simply to thwart their purpose. One of the weasels was  disabled by my shot, but the troop was not discouraged, and, after  making several feints to cross, one of them seized the wounded one and  bore it over, and the pack disappeared in the wall on the other side.    Let me conclude this chapter with two or three notes about this alert  enemy of the birds and the lesser animals, the weasel.    A farmer one day heard a queer growling sound in the grass; on  approaching the spot he saw two weasels contending over a mouse; each  had hold of the mouse pulling in opposite directions, and were so  absorbed in the struggle that the farmer cautiously put his hands down  and grabbed them both by the back of the neck. He put them in a cage,  and offered them bread and other food. This they refused to eat, but in  a few days one of them had eaten the other up, picking his bones clean  and leaving nothing but the skeleton.    The same farmer was one day in his cellar when two rats came out of a  hole near him in great haste, and ran up the cellar wall and along its  top till they came to a floor timber that stopped their progress, when  they turned at bay, and looked excitedly back along the course they had  come. In a moment a weasel, evidently in hot pursuit of them, came out  of the hole, and seeing the farmer, checked his course and darted back.  The rats had doubtless turned to give him fight, and would probably have  been a match for him.    The weasel seems to track its game by scent. A hunter of my acquaintance  was one day sitting in the woods, when he saw a red squirrel run with  great speed up a tree near him, and out upon a long branch, from which  he leaped to some rocks, and disappeared beneath them. In a moment a  weasel came in full course upon his trail, ran up the tree, then out  along the branch, from the end of which he leaped to the rocks as the  squirrel did, and plunged beneath them.    Doubtless the squirrel fell a prey to him. The squirrel's best game  would have been to have kept to the higher tree-tops, where he could  easily have distanced the weasel. But beneath the rocks he stood a very  poor chance. I have often wondered what keeps such an animal as the  weasel in check, for weasels are quite rare. They never need go hungry,  for rats and squirrels and mice and birds are everywhere. They probably  do not fall a prey to any other animal, and very rarely to man. But  the circumstances or agencies that check the increase of any species of  animal are, as Darwin says, very obscure and but little known.          BEES.          AN IDYL OF THE HONEY-BEE.      There is no creature with which man has surrounded himself that seems  so much like a product of civilization, so much like the result of  development on special lines and in special fields, as the honey-bee.  Indeed, a colony of bees, with their neatness and love of order, their  division of labor, their public spiritedness, their thrift, their  complex economies and their inordinate love of gain, seems as far  removed from a condition of rude nature as does a walled city or a  cathedral town. Our native bee, on the other hand, \"the burly, dozing  humble-bee,\" affects one more like the rude, untutored savage. He  has learned nothing from experience. He lives from hand to mouth. He  luxuriates in time of plenty, and he starves in times of scarcity.  He lives in a rude nest or in a hole in the ground, and in small  communities; he builds a few deep cells or sacks in which he stores a  little honey and bee-bread for his young, but as a worker in wax he is  of the most primitive and awkward. The Indian regarded the honey-bee as  an ill-omen. She was the white man's fly. In fact she was the epitome of  the white man himself. She has the white man's craftiness, his industry,  his architectural skill, his neatness and love of system, his foresight;  and above all his eager, miserly habits. The honeybee's great ambition  is to be rich, to lay up great stores, to possess the sweet of every  flower that blooms. She is more than provident. Enough will not satisfy  her, she must have all she can get by hook or by crook. She comes from  the oldest country, Asia, and thrives best in the most fertile and  long-settled lands.    Yet the fact remains that the honey-bee is essentially a wild creature,  and never has been and cannot be thoroughly domesticated. Its proper  home is the woods, and thither every new swarm counts on going;  and thither many do go in spite of the care and watchfulness of the  bee-keeper. If the woods in any given locality are deficient in trees  with suitable cavities, the bees resort to all sorts of makeshifts; they  go into chimneys, into barns and outhouses, under stones, into rocks,  and so forth. Several chimneys in my locality with disused flues are  taken possession of by colonies of bees nearly every season. One day,  while bee-hunting, I developed a line that went toward a farm-house  where I had reason to believe no bees were kept. I followed it up and  questioned the farmer about his bees. He said he kept no bees, but that  a swarm had taken possession of his chimney, and another had gone under  the clapboards in the gable end of his house. He had taken a large lot  of honey out of both places the year before. Another farmer told me that  one day his family had seen a number of bees examining a knot-hole in  the side of his house; the next day as they were sitting down to  dinner their attention was attracted by a loud humming noise, when  they discovered a swarm of bees settling upon the side of the house and  pouring into the knot-hole. In subsequent years other swarms came to the  same place.    Apparently, every swarm of bees before it leaves the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31630"],[0,"Hand-Loom Weaving: A Manual for School and Home (#8)"],[1,"and light. Here are  seven shades from the three dyes, and when we add white we see that the  weaver is already very well equipped with a variety of color. The eight  shades can be still further enlarged by clouding and mixing. The mixing  can be done in two ways, either by carding two tints together before  spinning, or by twisting them together when spun.    [Sidenote: _Carding and twisting_]    \"Carding together gives a very much better effect in wool, while  twisting together is preferable in cotton.    [Sidenote: _Blue_]    [Sidenote: _Pink_]    [Sidenote: _Gray_]    [Sidenote: _Clouding_]    \"Dark blue and white and medium blue and white wool carded together will  give two blue grays which cannot be obtained by dyeing, and are most  valuable. White and red carded together give a lovely pink, and any  shade of gray can be made by carding different proportions of black and  white or half-black and white. A valuable gray is made by carding black  and white wool together, and by black wool I mean the natural black or  brownish wool of black sheep. Mixing of deeply dyed and white wool  together in carding is, artistically considered, a very valuable  process, as it gives a softness of color which it is impossible to get  in any other way. Clouding, which is almost an indispensable process for  rug centers, can be done by winding certain portions of the skeins or  hanks of yarn very tightly and closely with twine before they are thrown  into the dye pot. The winding must be close enough to prevent the dye  penetrating to the yarn. This means, of course, when the clouding is to  be of white and another color. If it is to be two shades of one color,  as a light and medium blue, the skein is first dyed a light blue, and  after drying, is wound as I have described, and thrown again into the  dye pot, until the unwound portions become the darker blue which we call  medium.\"    [Sidenote: _Mrs. Albee's manual_]    Through the courtesy of Mrs. Helen R. Albee, who has done much to revive  an interest in rug-weaving, I am allowed to quote the following detailed  suggestions on the subject of dyeing from her helpful manual, _Abnakee  Rugs_. This little manual treats fully of the \"Abnakee Rug Industry,\"  the \"Materials,\" \"Methods of Work,\" and \"Dye Formulas.\" It was issued  through the Riverside Press in 1901.    Speaking of combinations of color, Mrs. Albee says:    [Sidenote: _Combinations of color_]    [Sidenote: _Safe tones_]    [Sidenote: _Colors in rugs_]    [Sidenote: _Use of white_]    \"A careful study of the effects of colors upon each other will show that  colors which are in themselves beautiful are often inharmonious when  combined. Also, a little of a color may be good, when a larger  proportion seems to destroy the balance or harmony. Success in this  matter is largely a matter of close observation and experience, although  some persons have a natural feeling or instinct regarding color which is  seldom in error. Strong colors should never be used, especially greens.  Though they may be modest in the piece, when worked in with other  colors, they have an unfortunate way of becoming intensified tenfold.  The safest tones for an amateur to deal with are dull gray green, yellow  green, and a soft, full, but dark olive. In striking a certain key in  color it should be maintained throughout. Thus, if a full rich color  predominates, rich dark colors should be used through the whole scheme.  If a light tone is the body color, soft light tones of other colors will  be found most harmonious. Thus, for example, a rug for a library, or a  hall, in which a good deal of rich terra cotta appears, should have a  border or design worked in dark blues, full shades of olive green, and  dull yellow. There is an apparent exception to this in the use of dull  reds, old ivory, and black as seen in Bokhara rugs. But if studied, the  cream color is very dull, and is used in such small quantities as to be  quite subdued by the black that is used freely in the pattern. Old rose,  warm golden browns, and olive may be used effectively. A light Gobelin  blue may be worked with ivory, old pink, light dull olive, and the  outlines can be either a dark yellow brown or very dark bronze green. An  ivory center is lovely with an old pink border worked in green. A tan  center may be combined with old rose, sage green, bronze green, light  yellow, cream color, and dark brown outlines. Indigo blue, forest green,  and dull yellow are excellent colors when combined. A great variety of  beautiful rugs may be made by using only blue and white, and unless one  wishes to go extensively into dyeing, it might be well to choose a  certain simple color scheme such as blue and white, red, black, and  ivory, and abide by it. Let it be remembered that white in rugs is not  white, neither is it a delicate cream. Unless it is decidedly yellowish  or even grayish in tone, when in combination with other colors, it  becomes a staring white that is anything but artistic. I dye my cream  colors, just as much as I do dark reds or greens.    [Sidenote: _Planning a color scheme for a rug_]    \"I have been asked many times what is the best way to plan a color  scheme for a rug. This is a point I cannot determine for another. Some  may find help in making water color sketches of what they wish to do. In  my own work I never use them, as it requires making a reduced drawing of  great accuracy, and much time to color it. Often I plan a combination  mentally, and match it up from the dyed flannels I always have on hand.  Other times I vary the scheme of some rug I have already made,  experimenting with different combinations, using other rugs as if they  were books of reference. I have discovered one rather curious thing,  which is, that when all my experimenting is done I find some particular  color scheme fits a certain rug as no other does. It seems to clothe or  to fulfill the pattern as if it belonged personally to it. When I once  discover this elective affinity of a pattern for its special coloring, I  never make it again save in that one guise.    [Sidenote: _Shading_]    [Sidenote: _Directions for shading_]    \"Much skill can be shown by an artistic worker in the use of slight  shades of difference in the same color. For example, in the plain center  of a rug, several tones representing shades of the same color will give  the effect of a play of light on a silky surface, which is very  beautiful. By using material that has been dyed a trifle darker at one  end of the rug, and working in gradually lighter tones, the result is  surprisingly effective. To do this, each three or four yards should be  dyed with these slight differences of tone; then when within thirty  strips of the end of one color (more or less, according to the width of  the rug), work in a broken line of the next tone all across the rug.  Then use a few rows (not worked in single rows, however) of the first  color across the entire rug, then a wider broken line of the second  color. Broken lines blend better than continuous lines do. The portions  of the second line should fall above the broken spaces left in the first  line (in the same way that masons lay bricks), then a little more of the  first color, using less and less of it, and increasing the width of the  second in masses, until the first color has become only broken lines  upon the ground of the second color. All the way through, any changes  of color should be merged in this way. Be sure to work this method from  side to side across the rug, as the frameful is filled.    [Sidenote: _Coloring_]    \"This is the most difficult feature of the whole handicraft, the actual  coloring, and yet for fine effects I should recommend only the use of  hand-dyed materials. Goods dyed by professional dyers are perfectly  uniform in color throughout, and rugs made of such material will have  nothing of that difference of tone, that play of color, that is  absolutely necessary for beauty.    [Sidenote: _Dye kettles_]    \"In dyeing use only brass, copper, granite, or porcelain kettles, unless  one goes into it on a large scale and uses regular machinery. Brass and  copper vessels are to be preferred, while iron, or tin showing iron, are  to be carefully avoided, as the mordants have a great affinity for iron  and ruin the color. I use a large brass kettle holding about five  gallons.    [Sidenote: _Mordants_]    \"For mordants I use Glauber salts and sulphuric acid, and with the  weight of cloth I use, it takes 3 oz. of Glauber salts and 3/4 oz. of  sulphuric acid (full strength) to each six yards of flannel. I use a  one-ounce Phenix graduate (American standard) measuring glass, and as  full strength sulphuric acid has about twice the specific gravity of  water, one should measure by the scale engraved on the right-hand side  of the glass. The left-hand scale is based upon the standard unit of  weight, which is water.    [Sidenote: _Uses of acids_]    \"In using sulphuric acid I dilute it in a little cold water in a cup by  pouring the acid on to the water, as sulphuric acid in uniting with  water causes a chemical reaction. Where a large quantity of acid is used  this reaction is accompanied by a sudden burst of steam, if the water  falls upon the acid. But in a small quantity as this, there is no  possible danger of accident if the acid is poured on the water.  Sulphuric acid should be closely stoppered and used with care, as it is  corrosive, eating holes in cotton or linen fabrics. With ordinary  precautions it can be used without the least difficulty.
