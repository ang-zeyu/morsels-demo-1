[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27262"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 3, May 1906 (#8)"],[1,"hristians,  following a passage of St. Paul (1 Cor. xi.), treated the practice of  men and women wearing each other's clothes as confounding the order of  nature, and as liable to heavy censure of anathema.    There was formerly rigorous punishment of persons poaching game with  blackened faces. Those who hunted in forests with faces disguised were  declared to be felons. And as disguises led to crime, and mummers often  were pretenders, all who assumed disguise or visors as mummers, and  attempted to enter houses or committed assaults in highways, were liable  to be arrested and committed to prison for three months, without bail.    The Mosaic law prohibited the practice of using alhenna, or putting an  indelible color on the skin, as was done on occasions of mourning, or in  resemblance of the dead, or in honor of some idol. And two fashions of  wearing the beard and hair were prohibited, as has been supposed, on  account of idolatrous association. Even Bacon said he wondered there was  no penal law against painting the face.    (_To be Continued._)          LIBERTY IN COMMON LIFE.    By BOLTON HALL.      IT seems to me that none of us see how far-reaching freedom will be.    The Socialists have abundantly shown that if only the wastes of  production and distribution were saved, two or three hours' labor per  day would produce all that we produce now. If, in addition to this  saving, the land, including all the resources of nature, were opened to  labor, so that all workers would use the best parts of the earth to the  best advantage, wealth would be so abundant that interest would  disappear.    Even now, with increased production, and notwithstanding the  restrictions on the issue of money and our crazy banking system,  interest is decreasing so that we find it hard to get 4 per cent. here.    Suppose to-day the mortgages and railroad bonds, which are forms of  ownership of land, were taken out of the market, what interest could we  get? Certainly not one per cent.    Were the restrictions on production of the tariff, taxes on products of  labor, patent monopolies, hindrances to the making of money through  franchise privileges done away with, and above all were private  appropriation of rent abolished, wealth would not be so abundant and so  easy to obtain that it would not be worth anyone's while to keep account  of what he had \"lent\" to another. With the disappearance, at once, of  interest and of the fear of poverty the motive for accumulations of more  than would be sufficient to provide against disability or old age will  disappear, while such small but universal accumulations made available  by a system of mutual banking will provide ample capital for all needed  enterprises.    Co-operation will spring up as a labor-saving device, and the great  abilities of the trust managers will be turned to public service instead  of public plunder.    Henry George is wrong in thinking that the increased demand for capital  due to free opportunities for labor would increase interest. If it did,  it would perpetuate a form of slavery. He omits to notice that the very  use of the capital would reproduce wealth and capital so much more  abundantly that it would destroy the motive for accumulation.    The time will come--it is even now at hand--when dollars and meals and  goods will be given to those who ask these as freely as candies or water  or cigars are offered to visitors. If I am wrong in this, then I am  wasting my efforts, as far as sincere efforts can be wasted.    If Socialism or Anarchism is needed to insure voluntary communism of  goods, then it is for Socialism or Anarchism that we should work; and  for me, if I could see, I would turn from single tax to either of them  as readily as I would turn down hill if I found that up hill was the  wrong road.    At present, hardly any one favors these views--of course, not  plutocrats, because the doctrine is dangerous; not Socialists, because  they think that its words turn Socialists into land reformers; nor  Anarchists, because they regard compulsory payment of a fair price for  the land one uses as a form of tax; not even single taxers, as yet,  because they are wedded to the theory of Henry George.    My only fear, if there be room for fear, is that the new liberty and  leisure will come too soon for the sordid people to make a wise use of  it. Yet such a fear is like that of a man who should fear that his jaw  would grind so hard as to destroy his teeth.    The world is moved by one Spirit, which everlastingly adjusts action  against reaction, so that all is and always must be well.    Do not shy at truth for fear of its logical consequence.    [Illustration]          STATISTICS.    By H. KELLY.    (_Special Cable Despatch to \"The Sun.\"_)      \"LONDON.--The result of the first organized census of the British Empire  is issued in a Blue Book. It shows that the empire consists of an  approximate area of 11,908,378 square miles, or more than one-fifth of  the entire land area of the world.    \"The population is about 400,000,000, of whom 54,000,000 are whites. The  population is roughly distributed as follows: In Asia, 300,000,000;  Africa, 43,000,000; Europe, 42,000,000; America, 7,500,000, and  Australasia, 5,000,000.    \"The most populous city after London is Calcutta. The highest  proportion of married persons is in India, Natal, Cyprus and Canada. The  lowest is in the West Indies. Depression in the birth rate is general  almost everywhere, but is most remarkable in Australasia. The proportion  of insane persons in the colonies is much below that in the United  Kingdom. Insanity is markedly decreasing in India, despite  consanguineous marriages. Indeed, the theory that such marriages produce  mental unsoundness is little supported by these statistics.\"    To those who read without preconceived notions, the figures given above  show how history repeats itself. The British Empire is decaying at the  centre, and the census just taken proves it conclusively. The proportion  of insane in the colonies, even in poor famine-stricken India, is \"much  below\" that in the United Kingdom. Striking as these figures on insanity  are, they convey but a part of the truth as to the real condition of the  people of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as all reference to  their material well-being (if we were Christians we would add and  spiritual, for over one million people in these countries never heard of  God) is carefully omitted. Charles Booth, author of that truly great  work, \"Life and Labor in London,\" seventeen volumes, estimates that 30  per cent. of the population of the United Kingdom live in a state of  poverty, and Seebohm Rowntree, author of \"Poverty, A Study of Town  Life,\" puts it at 27.84 per cent. Mr. Rowntree also states that an  average of one person in five, or 20 per cent. of the population, die in  some public institution, i. e., prison, poor-house, hospital or insane  asylum. These statements are depressing enough as they are, but they  become worse when we learn that the standard of living upon which they  are based are those enjoyed--we use the word advisedly--by poor-house  inmates. Think of this, ye Pharisees, Christian and otherwise, 30 per  cent. of the population of the British Isles living under such  conditions! These are not the idle statements of long-haired reformers  or yellow journalists, but of two very estimable Christian gentlemen,  both of them manufacturers and successful business men. They are  different from the ordinary exploiter only in the sense of being honest  and humane enough to recognize that something is radically wrong with  modern civilization and make an earnest attempt to remedy it.    In this connection it is worthy of note that when the proprietors of the  London \"Daily News\" had a systematic canvas and investigation made into  the housing conditions in London, some six or seven years ago, it was  found that 900,000 people, one-fifth of the population, were living in  violation of the law. This was the case notwithstanding that the law  says 400 cubic feet of air space for each adult and 200 cubic feet for  each child must be provided, whereas Professor Huxley, who at one time  was a physician in the East End of London, said at least 800 cubic feet  for an adult and 400 cubic feet for a child was absolutely necessary to  keep the air in a fair state of purity.    It was and is the proud boast of millions of people that they are  co-inheritors of this glorious empire, an empire the greatest the world  has ever seen: 400,000,000 souls and an area so vast that the sun never  sets on all its parts at one time. Pete Curran, the Trade Unionist and  Socialist, once remarked he knew parts of the empire upon which the sun  never shone, and Pete knew.    Glory and aggrandizement based upon injustice brings its own reward, and  when a people subjugate and exploit another, they must inevitably pay  the price of their own brutality and injustice. The handwriting is on  the wall in the shape of the present census report. Decaying at the  centre, the British Empire is rapidly going the way of the Persian,  Greek and Roman Empires, and her name will be synonymous with injustice  as theirs are. Nations no more than individuals can thrive, expand and  develop their best faculties unless their lives are based upon freedom  and justice. Not freedom to exploit a weaker person or people, not  justice before the law which is a mockery and a sham, but freedom for  each to live his own life in his own way, and justice to all in the  shape of equal opportunity to the earth and all it may contain.    This lesson applies equally to America, and if any of my countrymen are  so blind as not to see it, they deserve pity rather than censure, and it  is to be hoped their awakening will not long be delayed.          GERHART HAUPTMANN WITH THE WEAVERS OF SILESIA.    By MAX BAGINSKI.      WHEN I look at the last engraving in the illustrated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/273"],[0,"The Smalcald Articles (#8)"],[1,"free  as God has instituted [and ordained] it, and we wish neither  to rescind nor hinder His work; for Paul says, 1 Tim. 4, 1  ff., that this [prohibition of marriage] is a doctrine of  devils.    XII. Of the Church.    We do not concede to them that they are the Church, and [in  truth] they are not [the Church]; nor will we listen to those  things which, under the name of Church, they enjoin or forbid.  For, thank God, [to-day] a child seven years old knows what  the Church is, namely, the holy believers and lambs who hear  the voice of their Shepherd. For the children pray thus: I  believe in one holy [catholic or] Christian Church. This  holiness does not consist in albs, tonsures, long gowns, and  other of their ceremonies devised by them beyond Holy  Scripture, but in the Word of God and true faith.    XIII. How One is Justified before God, and of Good Works.    What I have hitherto and constantly taught concerning this I  know not how to change in the least, namely, that by faith, as  St. Peter says, we acquire a new and clean heart, and God will  and does account us entirely righteous and holy for the sake  of Christ, our Mediator. And although sin in the flesh has not  yet been altogether removed or become dead, yet He will not  punish or remember it.    And such faith, renewal, and forgiveness of sins is followed  by good works. And what there is still sinful or imperfect  also in them shall not be accounted as sin or defect, even  [and that, too] for Christ's sake; but the entire man, both as  to his person and his works, is to be called and to be  righteous and holy from pure grace and mercy, shed upon us  [unfolded] and spread over us in Christ. Therefore we cannot  boast of many merits and works, if they are viewed apart from  grace and mercy, but as it is written, 1 Cor. 1, 31: He that  glorieth, let him glory in the Lord, namely, that he has a  gracious God. For thus all is well. We say, besides, that if  good works do not follow, faith is false and not true.    XIV. Of Monastic Vows.    As monastic vows directly conflict with the first chief  article, they must be absolutely abolished. For it is of them  that Christ says, Matt. 24, 5. 23 ff.: I am Christ, etc. For  he who makes a vow to live as a monk believes that he will  enter upon a mode of life holier than ordinary Christians  lead, and wishes to earn heaven by his own works not only for  himself, but also for others; this is to deny Christ. And they  boast from their St. Thomas that a monastic vow is equal to  Baptism. This is blasphemy [against God].    XV. Of Human Traditions.    The declaration of the Papists that human traditions serve for  the remission of sins, or merit salvation, is [altogether]  unchristian and condemned, as Christ says Matt. 15, 9: In vain  they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of  men. Again, Titus 1, 14: That turn from the truth. Again, when  they declare that it is a mortal sin if one breaks these  ordinances [does not keep these statutes], this, too, is not  right.    These are the articles on which I must stand, and, God  willing, shall stand even to my death; and I do not know how  to change or to yield anything in them. If any one wishes to  yield anything, let him do it at the peril of his conscience.    Lastly, there still remains the Pope's bag of impostures  concerning foolish and childish articles, as, the dedication  of churches, the baptism of bells, the baptism of the  altarstone, and the inviting of sponsors to these rites, who  would make donations towards them. Such baptizing is a  reproach and mockery of Holy Baptism, hence should not be  tolerated. Furthermore, concerning the consecration of  wax-tapers, palm-branches, cakes, oats, [herbs,] spices, etc.,  which indeed, cannot be called consecrations, but are sheer  mockery and fraud. And such deceptions there are without  number, which we commend for adoration to their god and to  themselves, until they weary of it. We will [ought to] have  nothing to do with them.           Dr. Martin Luther subscribed.         Dr. Justus Jonas, Rector, subscribed with his own hand.         Dr. John Bugenhagen, Pomeranus, subscribed.         Dr. Caspar Creutziger subscribed.         Nicholas Amsdorf of Magdeburg subscribed.         George Spalatin of Altenburg subscribed.         I, Philip Melanchthon, also regard [approve] the above       articles as right and Christian. But regarding the Pope I hold       that, if he would allow the Gospel, his superiority over the       bishops which he has otherwise, is conceded to him by human       right also by us, for the sake of the peace and general unity       of those Christians who are also under him, and may be under       him hereafter.         John Agricola of Eisleben subscribed.       Gabriel Didymus subscribed.

I, Doctor John Bugenhagen, Pomeranus, again subscribe in the       name of Magister John Brentz, as on departing from Smalcald he       directed me orally and by a letter, which I have shown to       these brethren who have subscribed.         I, Dionysius Melander, subscribe to the Confession, the       Apology, and the Concordia on the subject of the Eucharist.         Paul Rhodius, Superintendent of Stettin.       Gerard Oemcken, Superintendent of the Church at Minden.         I, Brixius Northanus, Minister of the Church of Christ which       is at Soest, subscribe to the Articles of the Reverend Father       Martin Luther, and confess that hitherto I have thus believed       and taught, and by the Spirit of Christ I shall continue thus       to believe and teach.

I, Doctor John Lang, Preacher of the Church at Erfurt,       subscribe with my own hand in my own name, and in that of my       other coworkers in the Gospel, namely:       The Reverend Licentiate Ludwig Platz of Melsungen.       The Reverend Magister Sigismund Kirchner,       The Reverend Wolfgang Kiswetter,       The Reverend Melchior Weitmann       The Reverend John Thall.       The Reverend John Kilian.       The Reverend Nicholas Faber.       The Reverend Andrew Menser.         And I, Egidius Mechler, have subscribed with my own hand."]]]
