The road ran straight, a red, red line,        To Khirogram, for cream renowned,      Through pasture-meadows where the kine,        In knee-deep grass, stood magic bound      And half awake, involved in mist,        That floated in dun coils profound,      Till by the sudden sunbeams kist        Rich rainbow hues broke all around.        \"Shell-bracelets ho! Shell-bracelets ho!\"        The roadside trees still dripped with dew,      And hung their blossoms like a show.        Who heard the cry? 'Twas but a few,      A ragged herd-boy, here and there,        With his long stick and naked feet;      A ploughman wending to his care,        The field from which he hopes the wheat;      An early traveller, hurrying fast        To the next town; an urchin slow      Bound for the school; these heard and past,        Unheeding all,--\"Shell-bracelets ho!\"        Pellucid spread a lake-like tank        Beside the road now lonelier still,      High on three sides arose the bank        Which fruit-trees shadowed at their will;      Upon the fourth side was the Ghat,        With its broad stairs of marble white,      And at the entrance-arch there sat,        Full face against the morning light,      A fair young woman with large eyes,        And dark hair falling to her zone,      She heard the pedlar's cry arise,        And eager seemed his ware to own.        \"Shell-bracelets ho! See, maiden see!        The rich enamel sunbeam-kist!      Happy, oh happy, shalt thou be,        Let them but clasp that slender wrist;      These bracelets are a mighty charm,        They keep a lover ever true,      And widowhood avert, and harm,        Buy them, and thou shalt never rue.      Just try them on!\"--She stretched her hand,        \"Oh what a nice and lovely fit!      No fairer hand, in all the land,        And lo! the bracelet matches it.\"        Dazzled the pedlar on her gazed        Till came the shadow of a fear,      While she the bracelet arm upraised        Against the sun to view more clear.      Oh she was lovely, but her look        Had something of a high command      That filled with awe. Aside she shook        Intruding curls by breezes fanned      And blown across her brows and face,        And asked the price, which when she heard      She nodded, and with quiet grace        For payment to her home referred.        \"And where, O maiden, is thy house?        But no, that wrist-ring has a tongue,      No maiden art thou, but a spouse,        Happy, and rich, and fair, and young.\"      \"Far otherwise, my lord is poor,        And him at home thou shalt not find;      Ask for my father; at the door        Knock loudly; he is deaf, but kind.      Seest thou that lofty gilded spire        Above these tufts of foliage green?      That is our place; its point of fire        Will guide thee o'er the tract between.\"        \"That is the temple spire.\"--\"Yes, there        We live; my father is the priest,      The manse is near, a building fair        But lowly, to the temple's east.      When thou hast knocked, and seen him, say,        His daughter, at Dhamaser Ghat,      Shell-bracelets bought from thee to-day,        And he must pay so much for that.      Be sure, he will not let thee pass        Without the value, and a meal,      If he demur, or cry alas!        No money hath he,--then reveal,        \"Within the small box, marked with streaks        Of bright vermilion, by the shrine,      The key whereof has lain for weeks        Untouched, he'll find some coin,--'tis mine.      That will enable him to pay        The bracelet's price, now fare thee well!\"      She spoke, the pedlar went away,        Charmed with her voice, as by some spell;      While she left lonely there, prepared        To plunge into the water pure,      And like a rose her beauty bared,        From all observance quite secure.        Not weak she seemed, nor delicate,        Strong was each limb of flexile grace,      And full the bust; the mien elate,        Like hers, the goddess of the chase      On Latmos hill,--and oh, the face        Framed in its cloud of floating hair,      No painter's hand might hope to trace        The beauty and the glory there!      Well might the pedlar look with awe,        For though her eyes were soft, a ray      Lit them at times, which kings who saw        Would never dare to disobey.        Onwards through groves the pedlar sped        Till full in front the sunlit spire      Arose before him. Paths which led        To gardens trim in gay attire      Lay all around. And lo! the manse,        Humble but neat with open door!      He paused, and blest the lucky chance        That brought his bark to such a shore.      Huge straw ricks, log huts full of grain,        Sleek cattle, flowers, a tinkling bell,      Spoke in a language sweet and plain,        \"Here smiling Peace and Plenty dwell.\"        Unconsciously he raised his cry,        \"Shell-bracelets ho!\" And at his voice      Looked out the priest, with eager eye,        And made his heart at once rejoice.      \"Ho, _Sankha_ pedlar! Pass not by,        But step thou in, and share the food      Just offered on our altar high,        If thou art in a hungry mood.      Welcome are all to this repast!        The rich and poor, the high and low!      Come, wash thy feet, and break thy fast,        Then on thy journey strengthened go.\"        \"Oh thanks, good priest! Observance due        And greetings! May thy name be blest!      I came on business, but I knew,        Here might be had both food and rest      Without a charge; for all the poor        Ten miles around thy sacred shrine      Know that thou keepest open door,        And praise that generous hand of thine:      But let my errand first be told,        For bracelets sold to thine this day,      So much thou owest me in gold,        Hast thou the ready cash to pay?        \"The bracelets were enamelled,--so        The price is high.\"--\"How! Sold to mine?      Who bought them, I should like to know.\"        \"Thy daughter, with the large black eyne,      Now bathing at the marble ghat.\"        Loud laughed the priest at this reply,      \"I shall not put up, friend, with that;        No daughter in the world have I,      An only son is all my stay;        Some minx has played a trick, no doubt,      But cheer up, let thy heart be gay.        Be sure that I shall find her out.\"        \"Nay, nay, good father, such a face        Could not deceive, I must aver;      At all events, she knows thy place,        'And if my father should demur      To pay thee'--thus she said,--'or cry        He has no money, tell him straight      The box vermilion-streaked to try,        That's near the shrine.'\" \"Well, wait, friend, wait!\"      The priest said thoughtful, and he ran        And with the open box came back,      \"Here is the price exact, my man,        No surplus over, and no lack.        \"How strange! how strange! Oh blest art thou        To have beheld her, touched her hand,      Before whom Vishnu's self must bow,        And Brahma and his heavenly band!      Here have I worshipped her for years        And never seen the vision bright;      Vigils and fasts and secret tears        Have almost quenched my outward sight;      And yet that dazzling form and face        I have not seen, and thou, dear friend,      To thee, unsought for, comes the grace,        What may its purport be, and end?        \"How strange! How strange! Oh happy thou!        And couldst thou ask no other boon      Than thy poor bracelet's price? That brow        Resplendent as the autumn moon      Must have bewildered thee, I trow,        And made thee lose thy senses all.\"      A dim light on the pedlar now        Began to dawn; and he let fall      His bracelet basket in his haste,        And backward ran the way he came;      What meant the vision fair and chaste,        Whose eyes were they,--those eyes of flame?        Swift ran the pedlar as a hind,        The old priest followed on his trace,      They reached the Ghat but could not find        The lady of the noble face.      The birds were silent in the wood,        The lotus flowers exhaled a smell      Faint, over all the solitude,        A heron as a sentinel      Stood by the bank. They called,--in vain,        No answer came from hill or fell,      The landscape lay in slumber's chain,        E'en Echo slept within her cell.        Broad sunshine, yet a hush profound!        They turned with saddened hearts to go;      Then from afar there came a sound        Of silver bells;--the priest said low,      \"O Mother, Mother, deign to hear,        The worship-hour has rung; we wait      In meek humility and fear.        Must we return home desolate?      Oh come, as late thou cam'st unsought,        Or was it but an idle dream?      Give us some sign if it was not,        A word, a breath, or passing gleam.\"        Sudden from out the water sprung        A rounded arm, on which they saw      As high the lotus buds among        It rose, the bracelet white, with awe.      Then a wide ripple tost and swung        The blossoms on that liquid plain,      And lo! the arm so fair and young        Sank in the waters down again.      They bowed before the mystic Power,        And as they home returned in thought,      Each took from thence a lotus flower        In memory of the day and spot.        Years, centuries, have passed away,        And still before the temple shrine      Descendants of the pedlar pay        Shell bracelets of the old design      As annual tribute. Much they own        In lands and gold,--but they confess      From that eventful day alone        Dawned on their industry,--success.      Absurd may be the tale I tell,        Ill-suited to the marching times,      I loved the lips from which it fell,        So let it stand among my rhymes.          IV.    THE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#8)"],[1,"   After cleaning either the inside or out of a skin with plaster it will  be necessary to gently beat it with a whisk broom or something similar  to dislodge the particles of plaster. A current of air (from a bicycle  pump, for instance) will remove the dust from the feathers when dry.    [Illustration: SCIENTIFIC SKINS, SMALL ANIMALS AND BIRDS.]    Fewest dry scientific skins are made up from the quadrupeds, but in case  the matter of transportation prevents wet preservation or they are  wanted dry the all around taxidermist must practice at making them up  also. Like the bird skin they should be thoroughly rid of flesh and fat  after skinning but do not require such finical handling. Rinsing in  water with a little washing powder or soda added will remove blood  stains and some grease but the benzine bath with the drying after, as  recommended in the chapter on tanning, etc., will be needed in case of  very fat specimens.    All small animals are made up about the same as birds, wrapping the leg  bones in tow, oakum or cotton and filling out the body with the same  material. The skull cleaned and poisoned had best be put in the centre  of the body with the filling, when it can be found at any time by  ripping a few of the stitches.    The skin of the head is filled out with the same material and the tail  may either be bent up under the body or drawn together by a few stitches  around a wrapped wire extending into the body half its length. Of course  the operator will see that the entire inner surface of the skin is  treated liberally with some preservative, arsenical paste preferably,  before the filling process.    After stitching up the opening cut the skin is laid on a board, back up  and the legs neatly disposed, the front feet beside the head and the  hind ones drawn back beside the tail. The feet are fastened with a pin  each and after smoothing down the fur with a small metal fur comb the  skin is laid aside in an airy, shady place until fully dry.    With each scientific skin a record should be made of the following  details:    1. Length, end of nose to root of tail.    2. Length of tail from root to end of bone.    3. Height at shoulders.    4. Color of eyes, lips, feet, etc.    5. Name of species, sex, locality, date, and collector's name.    These may be noted down on a corner of the outline sheet, which is  numbered and filed away; the skin tagged with a duplicate number is put  in the pickle jar or made up as a dried skin, whichever is desired, or  the full information may be put on a tag attached to the skin. Many  collectors simply number all specimens and preserve all information in  their note books. The foregoing details are sufficient for animals less  than bear and deer in size.    The larger animals should have as many as possible of the following  additional measurements:        Distance hip joint to shoulder joint.      Circumference of forearm.            \"       \"  neck.            \"       \"  body.      Back of leg.      Weight if possible.    Skins of large animals, a bear for instance, may have a slight wrapping  of tow or excelsior on the leg bones to prevent their coming in contact  with the skin and the whole skin laid to dry on a scaffold of poles or  something similar. When nearly dry fold up with the legs inside in a  square shaped package. This can be tied up with heavy cord or even sewed  up in burlap to prevent damaging the skin in transit. Fish and reptiles  are not a success as dry skins.          CHAPTER VIII.    PREPARING DRY AND WET SKINS FOR MOUNTING.      Let us assume that we have a dry skin each of a small bird and a furred  animal which has been properly made up sometime in the past and which it  is necessary to mount. Taking the bird skin first, the usual way is to  first wrap the unfeathered parts of legs in some strips of cotton cloth  saturated with water containing a few drops of carbolic acid until they  begin to relax or lose their stiffness somewhat.    Then the filling may be removed from the whole interior of the skin and  be replaced with pieces of cotton, dampened as before, and the whole  skin wrapped in a cloth or shut in a close box until with some scraping  and manipulation it becomes as pliable as when first removed. Any little  lumps of dried muscle should be broken up and the edges of the opening  cut, scraped and stretched out as they are very apt to wrinkle and curl  up, thus reducing the size of the skin considerably.    The eye sockets are to be filled with balls of wet cotton to render the  lids and surrounding skin soft. The roots of quills and tufts of large  feathers will need loosening as some flesh is necessarily left around  them.    The small animal skin may be treated the same way but the most thorough  and expeditious method of relaxing skins of both animals and birds  (except the smallest of the latter) is to plunge them into water, clear  in cool weather, slightly carbolized in warm, until they are pretty well  relaxed. Then go after the inner side with scraper until any lumps of  fat, muscle and the inner skin are well scratched up. Soak in benzine or  gasoline and clean with hot meal, sand, sawdust or plaster as directed  for tanning. Remember that bird skins must be handled carefully, so do  not be too strenuous in beating and shaking them.    Of course if any skin has been laid away with quantities of fat adhering  it will need very gingerly handling to save it, in fact unless  _very_ rare such skins are not worth trying to save as they have  little durability however treated. The largest polar bear skin I ever  saw was ruined by lying \"in the grease\" too long before dressing. Bird  skins preserved with the glycerine carbolic preparation require relaxing  the legs and a cleaning and dampening up of the inside of the skins.    Furred skins from the pickle need a good scraping on their inner  surface, thorough rinsing in soda solution to neutralize the acid and  remove all salt, then the benzine bath and cleaning. Don't forget to  rinse salted or pickled skins else beads of moisture will form on the  specimen in damp weather and crystals of salt in dry.    [Illustration: FOOT SKINNED OUT.]    Occasionally an extra rare skin will drop to pieces through age or other  infirmities when being prepared for mounting. The only hope for it then  is to glue and pin it piecemeal on a manikin covered with some  preparation which gives it a firm surface. While an expert will achieve  fair results in such work the amateur could hardly expect success.          CHAPTER IX.    MOUNTING SMALL AND MEDIUM BIRDS.      A word of advice to the beginner as to the variety of specimen to use in  first trials. Don't begin on too small a bird until somewhat adept;  unpracticed fingers bungle sadly over tiny feathered bodies. A first  subject should be at least as large as a bob white to give room to work,  and of some variety in which the feathers are firmly embedded.    Snow birds, cardinals, and some others have very thin delicate skins,  the pigeons shed their feathers on little or no provocation. Blackbirds  and jays are very good to practice on but the very best would be a coot,  sometimes called crow duck or mudhen. It is of fair size, closely  covered with feathers which will fall in place readily after skinning  and wiring even at the hands of a beginner.    Many, in fact most, birds have numerous bare patches which the adjacent  feathered tracts cover perfectly while in the flesh, but which a too  generous filling will exhibit in all their nakedness. I had not  discovered this until some of my first attempts at mounting birds  nonplussed me by showing numerous patches of bare skin in spite of the  fact that but a few feathers had become loosened in the handling.    We will assume that a suitable specimen is at hand, freshly killed and  properly skinned as per the directions already given. All bones  remaining with the skin, lower leg, wing, skull, etc., have been  stripped of flesh and any shreds remaining poisoned, as has the entire  inner surface of skin. With the skinned body at hand cut three wires of  suitable size, one a little more than twice the length of the body and  neck, for the body wire, the other two about twice the length of the  legs may be a size larger as it is important that the leg wires furnish  adequate support.    [Illustration: CLINCHING LEG WIRES IN ARTIFICIAL BODY OF BIRD]    Form the body wire into a loop which is the outline of the body laid on  one side with the surplus end projecting along the line of the neck.  This loop should not be quite as large as the body, however, to allow  for a thin layer of filling material over it. Wad up a handful of coarse  tow, push it inside the body loop and wind with coarse thread, drawing  in by pressure and winding and building out with flakes of tow to a  rough shape of the skinned body. The neck also is built up the same way,  making it fully as thick as the original but no longer ever.    [Illustration: WIRE LOOP FOR BIRD BODY.]    If the wire projects more than a couple of inches from this artificial  neck, cut it off at that length and with a flat file or emery wheel give  it a sharp triangular point. The leg wires, too, should be pointed  similarly. All wire should be smooth, straight, and free from kinks to  work well. Coming in coils it will require straightening, the larger  sizes with mallet or hammer and No. 18 and smaller by fastening one end  in the vise and giving the other a sharp tug with a pair of pliers. It  will be felt to stretch slightly and become quite straight.    Next insert the pointed end of a leg wire in the bottom of the foot and  pass it up along the back of the bone between it and the skin. A  considerable knack is necessary to do this successfully and some force  must be used. Passing the heel joint is difficult but having done this  and emerged inside the skin continue to pass it until it is a little  longer than the leg bone beside it.    [I"]]]
