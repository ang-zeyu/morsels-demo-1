Insect memory, it must be confessed, is a strange one, displaying such  lucidity in its general acquaintance with locality and such limitations  in its knowledge of the dwelling. I feel inclined to call it  topographical instinct: it grasps the map of the country and not the  beloved nest, the home itself. The Bembex-wasps (Cf. \"Insect Life\":  chapters 16 to 19.--Translator's Note.) have already led us to a like  conclusion. When the nest is laid open, these Wasps become wholly  indifferent to the family, to the grub writhing in agony in the sun.  They do not recognize it. What they do recognize, what they seek and  find with marvellous precision, is the site of the entrance-door of  which nothing at all is left, not even the threshold.    If any doubts remained as to the incapacity of the Mason-bee of the  Walls to know her nest other than by the place which the pebble occupies  on the ground, here is something to remove them: for the nest of one  Mason-bee, I substitute that of another, resembling it as closely as  possible in respect to both masonry and storage. This exchange and  those of which I shall speak presently are of course made in the owner's  absence. The Bee settles without hesitation in this nest which is not  hers, but which stands where the other did. If she was building, I offer  her a cell in process of building. She continues the masonry with the  same care and the same zeal as if the work already done were her  own work. If she was fetching honey and pollen, I offer her a  partly-provisioned cell. She continues her journeys, with honey in her  crop and pollen under her belly, to finish filling another's warehouse.  The Bee, therefore, does not suspect the exchange; she does not  distinguish between what is her property and what is not; she imagines  that she is still working at the cell which is really hers.    After leaving her for a time in possession of the strange nest, I give  her back her own. This fresh change passes unperceived by the Bee: the  work is continued in the cell restored to her at the point which it had  reached in the substituted cell. I once more replace it by the strange  nest; and again the insect persists in continuing its labour. By thus  constantly interchanging the strange nest and the proper nest, without  altering the actual site, I thoroughly convinced myself of the Bee's  inability to discriminate between what is her work and what is not.  Whether the cell belong to her or to another, she labours at it with  equal zest, so long as the basis of the edifice, the pebble, continues  to occupy its original position.    The experiment receives an added interest if we employ two neighbouring  nests the work on which is about equally advanced. I move each to where  the other stood. They are not much more than thirty inches a part. In  spite of their being so near to each other that it is quite possible for  the insects to see both homes at once and choose between them, each Bee,  on arriving, settles immediately on the substituted nest and continues  her work there. Change the two nests as often as you please and you  shall see the two Mason-bees keep to the site which they selected and  labour in turn now at their own cell and now at the other's.    One might think that the cause of this confusion lies in a close  resemblance between the two nests, for at the start, little expecting  the results which I was to obtain, I used to choose the nests which I  interchanged as much alike as possible, for fear of disheartening the  Bees. I need not have taken this precaution: I was giving the insect  credit for a perspicacity which it does not possess. Indeed, I now  take two nests which are extremely unlike each other, the only point of  resemblance being that, in each case, the toiler finds a cell in which  she can continue the work which she is actually doing. The first is an  old nest whose dome is perforated with eight holes, the apertures of the  cells of the previous generation. One of these cells has been repaired;  and the Bee is busy storing it. The second is a nest of recent  construction, which has not received its mortar dome and consists of  a single cell with its stucco covering. Here too the insect is busy  hoarding pollen-paste. No two nests could present greater differences:  one with its eight empty chambers and its spreading clay dome; the other  with its single bare cell, at most the size of an acorn.    Well, the two Mason-bees do not hesitate long in front of these  exchanged nests, not three feet away from each other. Each makes for the  site of her late home. One, the original owner of the old nest, finds  nothing but a solitary cell. She rapidly inspects the pebble and,  without further formalities, first plunges her head into the strange  cell, to disgorge honey, and then her abdomen, to deposit pollen. And  this is not an action due to the imperative need of ridding herself as  quickly as possible, no matter where, of an irksome load, for the Bee  flies off and soon comes back again with a fresh supply of provender,  which she stores away carefully. This carrying of provisions to  another's larder is repeated as often as I permit it. The other Bee,  finding instead of her one cell a roomy structure consisting of eight  apartments, is at first not a little embarrassed. Which of the eight  cells is the right one? In which is the heap of paste on which she had  begun? The Bee therefore visits the chambers one by one, dives right  down to the bottom and ends by finding what she seeks, that is to say,  what was in her nest when she started on her last journey, the nucleus  of a store of food. Thenceforward she behaves like her neighbour and  goes on carrying honey and pollen to the warehouse which is not of her  constructing.    Restore the nests to their original places, exchange them yet once  again and both Bees, after a short hesitation which the great difference  between the two nests is enough to explain, will pursue the work in the  cell of her own making and in the strange cell alternately. At last the  egg is laid and the sanctuary closed, no matter what nest happens to be  occupied at the moment when the provisioning reaches completion. These  incidents are sufficient to show why I hesitate to give the name of  memory to the singular faculty that brings the insect back to her nest  with such unerring precision and yet does not allow her to distinguish  her work from some one else's, however great the difference may be.    We will now experiment with Chalicodoma muraria from another  psychological point of view. Here is a Mason-bee building; she is at  work on the first course of her cell. I give her in exchange a cell not  only finished as a structure, but also filled nearly to the top with  honey. I have just stolen it from its owner, who would not have been  long before laying her egg in it. What will the Mason do in the presence  of this munificent gift, which saves her the trouble of building and  harvesting? She will leave the mortar no doubt, finish storing the  Bee-bread, lay her egg and seal up. A mistake, an utter mistake:  our logic is not the logic of the insect, which obeys an inevitable,  unconscious prompting. It has no choice as to what it shall do; it  cannot discriminate between what is and what is not advisable; it  glides, as it were, down an irresistible slope prepared beforehand to  bring it to a definite end. This is what the facts that still remain to  be stated proclaim with no uncertain voice.    The Bee who was building and to whom I offer a cell ready-built and full  of honey does not lay aside her mortar for that. She was doing mason's  work; and, once on that tack, guided by the unconscious impulse, she  has to keep masoning, even though her labour be useless, superfluous  and opposed to her interests. The cell which I give her is certainly  perfect, looked upon as a building, in the opinion of the master-builder  herself, since the Bee from whom I took it was completing the provision  of honey. To touch it up, especially to add to it, is useless and, what  is more, absurd. No matter: the Bee who was masoning will mason. On the  aperture of the honey-store she lays a first course of mortar, followed  by another and yet another, until at last the cell is a third taller  then the regulation height. The masonry-task is now done, not as  perfectly, it is true, as if the Bee had gone on with the cell whose  foundations she was laying at the moment when I exchanged the nests, but  still to an extent which is more than enough to prove the overpowering  impulse which the builder obeys. Next comes the victualling, which is  also cut short, lest the honey-store swelled by the joint contributions  of the two Bees should overflow. Thus the Mason-bee who is beginning  to build and to whom we give a complete cell, a cell filled with honey,  makes no change in the order of her work: she builds first and then  victuals. Only she shortens her work, her instinct warning her that the  height of the cell and the quantity of honey are beginning to assume  extravagant proportions.    The converse is equally conclusive. To a Mason-bee engaged in  victualling I give a nest with a cell only just begun and not at all fit  to receive the paste. This cell, with its last course still wet with its  builder's saliva, may or may not be accompanied by other cells recently  closed up, each with its honey and its egg. The Bee, finding this in the  place of her half-filled honey-store, is greatly perplexed what to do  when she comes with her harvest to this unfinished, shallow cup, in  which there is no place to put the honey. She inspects it, measures  it with her eyes, tries it with her antennae and recognizes its  insufficient capacity. She hesitates for a long time, goes away, comes  back, flies away again and soon returns, eager to deposit her treasure.  The insect's embarrassment is most evident;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2885"],[0,"The House of the Wolfings (#8)"],[1," And adown the glades of the oakwood the morning sun lay bright.     Then a hind came out of the thicket and stood on the sunlit glade,     And turned her head toward the oak tree and a step on toward me made.     Then stopped, and bounded aback, and away as if in fear,     That I saw her no more; then I wondered, though sitting close anear     Was a she-wolf great and grisly.  But with her was I wont to play,     And pull her ears, and belabour her rugged sides and grey,     And hold her jaws together, while she whimpered, slobbering     For the love of my love; and nowise I deemed her a fearsome thing.     There she sat as though she were watching, and o'er head a blue-winged     jay     Shrieked out from the topmost oak-twigs, and a squirrel ran his way     Two tree-trunks off.  But the she-wolf arose up suddenly     And growled with her neck-fell bristling, as if danger drew anigh;     And therewith I heard a footstep, for nice was my ear to catch     All the noises of the wild-wood; so there did we sit at watch     While the sound of feet grew nigher: then I clapped hand on hand     And crowed for joy and gladness, for there out in the sun did stand     A man, a glorious creature with a gleaming helm on his head,     And gold rings on his arms, in raiment gold-broidered crimson-red.     Straightway he strode up toward us nor heeded the wolf of the wood     But sang as he went in the oak-glade, as a man whose thought is good,     And nought she heeded the warrior, but tame as a sheep was grown,     And trotted away through the wild-wood with her crest all laid adown.     Then came the man and sat down by the oak-bole close unto me     And took me up nought fearful and set me on his knee.     And his face was kind and lovely, so my cheek to his cheek I laid     And touched his cold bright war-helm and with his gold rings played,     And hearkened his words, though I knew not what tale they had to tell,     Yet fain was my heart of their music, and meseemed I loved him well.     So we fared for a while and were fain, till he set down my feet on the     grass,     And kissed me and stood up himself, and away through the wood did he     pass.     And then came back the she-wolf and with her I played and was fain.     Lo the first thing I remember: wilt thou have me babble again?\"    Spake the Carline and her face was soft and kind:       \"Nay damsel, long would I hearken to thy voice this summer day.     But how didst thou leave the wild-wood, what people brought thee     away?\"    Then said the Hall-Sun:       \"I awoke on a time in the even, and voices I heard as I woke;     And there was I in the wild-wood by the bole of the ancient oak,     And a ring of men was around me, and glad was I indeed     As I looked upon their faces and the fashion of their weed.     For I gazed on the red and the scarlet and the beaten silver and gold,     And blithe were their noble faces and kindly to behold,     And nought had I seen of such-like since that hour of the other day     When that warrior came to the oak glade with the little child to play.     And forth now he came, with the face that my hands had fondled before,     And a battle shield wrought fairly upon his arm he bore,     And thereon the wood-wolf's image in ruddy gold was done.     Then I stretched out my little arms towards the glorious shining one     And he took me up and set me on his shoulder for a while     And turned about to his fellows with a blithe and joyous smile;     And they shouted aloud about me and drew forth gleaming swords     And clashed them on their bucklers; but nought I knew of the words     Of their shouting and rejoicing.  So thereafter was I laid     And borne forth on the warrior's warshield, and our way through the     wood we made     'Midst the mirth and great contentment of those fair-clad shielded     men.       \"But no tale of the wolf and the wild-wood abides with me since then,     And the next thing I remember is a huge and dusky hall,     A world for my little body from ancient wall to wall;     A world of many doings, and nought for me to do,     A world of many noises, and known to me were few.       \"Time wore, and I spoke with the Wolfings and knew the speech of the     kin,     And was strange 'neath the roof no longer, as a lonely waif therein;     And I wrought as a child with my playmates and every hour looked on     Unto the next hour's joyance till the happy day was done.     And going and coming amidst us was a woman tall and thin     With hair like the hoary barley and silver streaks therein.     And kind and sad of visage, as now I remember me,     And she sat and told us stories when we were aweary with glee,     And many of us she fondled, but me the most of all.     And once from my sleep she waked me and bore me down the hall,     In the hush of the very midnight, and I was feared thereat.     But she brought me unto the dais, and there the warrior sat,     Who took me up and kissed me, as erst within the wood;     And meseems in his arms I slumbered: but I wakened again and stood     Alone with the kindly woman, and gone was the goodly man,     And athwart the hush of the Folk-hall the moon shone bright and wan,     And the woman dealt with a lamp hung up by a chain aloft,     And she trimmed it and fed it with oil, while she chanted sweet and     soft     A song whose words I knew not: then she ran it up again,     And up in the darkness above us died the length of its wavering     chain.\"    \"Yea,\" said the carline, \"this woman will have been the Hall-Sun that  came before thee.  What next dost thou remember?\"    Said the maiden:       \"Next I mind me of the hazels behind the People's Roof,     And the children running thither and the magpie flitting aloof,     And my hand in the hand of the Hall-Sun, as after the others we went,     And she soberly hearkening my prattle and the words of my intent.     And now would I call her 'Mother,' and indeed I loved her well.       \"So I waxed; and now of my memories the tale were long to tell;     But as the days passed over, and I fared to field and wood,     Alone or with my playmates, still the days were fair and good.     But the sad and kindly Hall-Sun for my fosterer now I knew,     And the great and glorious warrior that my heart clung sorely to     Was but my foster-father; and I knew that I had no kin     In the ancient House of the Wolfings, though love was warm therein.\"    Then smiled the carline and said: \"Yea, he is thy foster-father, and yet  a fond one.\"    \"Sooth is that,\" said the Hall-Sun.  \"But wise art thou by seeming.  Hast  thou come to tell me of what kindred I am, and who is my father and who  is my mother?\"    Said the carline: \"Art thou not also wise?  Is it not so that the Hall-  Sun of the Wolfings seeth things that are to come?\"    \"Yea,\" she said, \"yet have I seen waking or sleeping no other father save  my foster-father; yet my very mother I have seen, as one who should meet  her in the flesh one day.\"    \"And good is that,\" said the carline; and as she spoke her face waxed  kinder, and she said:    \"Tell us more of thy days in the House of the Wolfings and how thou  faredst there.\"    Said the Hall-Sun:       \"I waxed 'neath the Roof of the Wolfings, till now to look upon     I was of sixteen winters, and the love of the Folk I won,     And in lovely weed they clad me like the image of a God:     And lonely now full often the wild-wood ways I trod,     And I feared no wild-wood creature, and my presence scared them     nought;     And I fell to know of wisdom, and within me stirred my thought,     So that oft anights would I wander through the mead and far away,     And swim the Mirkwood-water, and amidst his eddies play     When earth was dark in the dawn-tide; and over all the folk     I knew of the beasts' desires, as though in words they spoke.       \"So I saw of things that should be, were they mighty things or small,     And upon a day as it happened came the war-word to the hall,     And the House must wend to the warfield, and as they sang, and played     With the strings of the harp that even, and the mirth of the war-eve     made,     Came the sight of the field to my eyes, and the words waxed hot in me,     And I needs must show the picture of the end of the fight to be.     Then I showed them the Red Wolf bristling o'er the broken fleeing foe;     And the war-gear of the fleers, and their banner did I show,     To wit the Ling-worm's image with the maiden in his mouth;     There I saw my foster-father 'mid the pale blades of the South,     Till aloof swept all the handplay and the hurry of the chase,     And he lay along by an ash-tree, no helm about his face,     No byrny on his body; and an arrow in his thigh,     And a broken spear in his shoulder.  Then I saw myself draw nigh     To sing the song blood-staying.  Then saw I how we twain     Went 'midst of the host triumphant in the Wolfings' banner-wain,     The black bulls lowing before us athwart the warriors' song,     As up from Mirkwood-water we went our ways along     To the Great Roof of the Wolfings, whence streamed the women out     And the sound of their rejoicing blent with the warriors' shout.       \"They heard me and saw the picture, and they wotted how wise I was     grown,     And they loved me, and glad were their hearts at the tale my lips had     shown;     And my body clad as an image of a God to the field they bore,     And I held by the mast of the banner as I looked upon their war,     And endured to see unblenching on the wind-swept sunny plain     All the picture of my vision by the men-folk done again.     And over my Foster-father I sang the staunching-song,     Till the life-blood that was ebbing flowed back to his heart the     strong,     And we wended back in the war-wain 'midst the gleanings of the fight     Unto the ancient dwelling and the Hall-Sun's glimmering light.       \"So from that day henceforward folk hung upon my words, "]]]
