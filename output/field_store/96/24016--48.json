I wouldn't be fit to be a soldier if I  didn't know how to stand fast. Just as though it makes any difference  whether a girl is rich or poor if she's a dear and one likes her. How  can some girls be so silly? They wouldn't be if they had Mary's and my  military training. When in doubt ask your captain.\"    She laughed gaily, then her merry glance changed to one of dismay. \"Good  gracious! It's fifteen minutes to one. I'll have to eat my luncheon in  a hurry.\" With a hasty kiss Marjorie flitted from the room and down the  stairs to the dining-room.    After luncheon she lingered for a brief moment with her mother, then set  off for the afternoon session of school. But she could not help  wondering as she walked just how it would seem to be in the freshman  class but not of it.          CHAPTER VII    THE WARNING      The afternoon session of school passed uneventfully for Marjorie. She  had returned too late from luncheon to hold more than a few words of  conversation with the Picture Girl. In spite of the watchful espionage  of Miss Merton, whose eyes seemed riveted to her side of the room,  Muriel managed to convey to Marjorie the news that the girls were dying  to meet her and were so sorry they had missed her at noon.    \"We waited for you more than ten minutes,\" Muriel whispered guardedly.  \"Mignon saw you stop at Professor Fontaine's desk. We knew what that  meant. It always takes him forever to explain anything. Do you remember  a black-haired, black-eyed girl in the French class this morning? She  wore the sweetest brown crepe-de-chine dress. Well, that's Mignon La  Salle. Her father is the richest man in Sanford. Mignon could go away to  school if she liked, but she doesn't care about it. Tell you more  later.\"    Muriel faced front with a sudden jerk that could mean but one thing.  Marjorie cast a fleeting glance at Miss Merton. The teacher was frowning  angrily, as though about to deliver a rebuke. Luckily for the two girls,  the first recitation bell rang and they stood not upon the order of  their going, but went with alacrity. Once outside the study-hall door  they were safe.    \"I don't know what ails Miss Merton,\" complained Muriel. \"She has never  said a word to me before. That's twice to-day she has shown her claws.\"    \"She doesn't like me,\" said Marjorie, calmly, \"and I don't like her. I  think she is the rudest teacher I ever knew. It was I, not you that she  meant that scolding for this morning.\"    \"Nonsense!\" scoffed Muriel. \"She likes you as well as she likes the rest  of us. I don't believe she is awfully, terribly, fearfully fond of  girls. When she was young she must have been one of those stiff, prim  goody-goodies; the distressingly snippy sort that made all her friends  so tired.\" Muriel laughed softly.    Marjorie smiled at Muriel's unflattering description of Miss Merton's  youth, then her face sobered. In her heart she knew that Miss Merton  disliked her, and the knowledge was not pleasant. She made an earnest  resolve to overcome the teacher's prejudice. She would make Miss Merton  like her.    Muriel went with her as far as the door of the history room, which was  in charge of Miss Atkins, a stout, middle-aged woman, who beamed amiably  upon Marjorie, entered her name in the class register, motioned her to a  front seat and promptly appeared to forget her existence. But though  Miss Atkins exhibited small personal interest in her new pupil, such was  not the case with regard to the subject which she taught. The lesson  dealt with the coming of the Virginia colonists, their settlement in  Jamestown and the final burning of the town. Miss Atkins' vivid  description of the colonists' determined struggles to gain a foothold in  the New World was well worth listening to. The reading of extracts from  special reference books pertaining to that gallant expedition into the  treacherous forests of an unknown, untried country made the lesson seem  doubly interesting. When the recitation was over Marjorie went back to  the study hall congratulating herself on the fact that she had not  dropped history, and reflecting that no one would ever have suspected  Miss Atkins of being so fascinating.    As she groped in her desk for her textbook on physiology, she looked  about her for some sign of Constance Stevens. She recollected that she  had not seen her in her seat when the afternoon session began. The  moment her recitation in physiology was over she hastened to the locker  room. No, her new friend's hat was not there. She had not returned to  school after luncheon. Marjorie reached for her own hat, vaguely  wondering what had happened to keep Constance away from school.    She stood meditatively poking her hatpins in and out of her hat, when  the sound of footsteps on the stairs came to her ears. School was over  for the day. She put on her hat in a hurry, took a swift peep at herself  as she passed the one large mirror that hung at the end of the  freshmen's lockers, and ran up the stairs. She would not disappoint  Muriel's friends again.    This time she was first on the scene, standing on the identical spot  where she had stood the day Constance rushed weeping past her. Why  didn't her class come out? Surely she had heard their footsteps on the  stairs. But it was fully five minutes before the stream of girls began  to issue from the big doors. Then Muriel appeared, surrounded by her  friends, and in another instant the girl with the dimples, the  fair-haired girl, the stout girl and the Evil Genius were, with varying  degrees of friendliness, telling Marjorie Dean that they were glad to  meet her.    Susan Atwell said so frankly with a delightful show of dimples. Irma  Linton looked the acme of gentle friendliness. Geraldine Macy's face  wore an expression of open admiration. Mignon La Salle's greeting,  however, was distinctly reserved. To be sure, she smiled; but Muriel,  who had been furtively watching her, knew that the French girl was not  pleased with the idea of admitting another girl to their fellowship.    \"The rest of the girls like her,\" thought Muriel. \"Mignon will find  she'll have to give in this time.\" Purposely, to make sure she was  right, she said boldly: \"Miss Dean, will you go to the basketball tryout  with us on Friday afternoon?\"    \"Yes, do,\" urged Geraldine Macy, eagerly.    \"We'd love to have you,\" came from Susan Atwell. \"We understand that you  are a star player.\"    \"Of course you must,\" smiled Irma Linton.    The French girl alone hesitated. Her eyes roved speculatively from one  face to another, then she said suavely, \"Come by all means, Miss Dean.  It will be quite interesting.\"    \"Thank you. I shall be pleased to go with you.\" Marjorie ignored  Mignon's slight hesitation, although she had noted it. \"I wonder if you  are all as fond of basketball as I,\" she went on quickly. \"It's a  splendid game, isn't it?\"    Her new acquaintances answered with emphasis that it was certainly a  great game, and, the ice now broken, they began to ply their new  acquaintance with questions. How did she like Sanford? Did it seem  strange to her after a big city high school? What subjects had she  selected? Had she met any other girls besides themselves?    Marjorie answered them readily enough. She was glad to be one of a  crowd of girls again.    \"Have you met any other girls?\" asked Geraldine Macy, abruptly.    \"I met a Miss Seymour before I had even gone as far as Miss Archer's  office. She is a delightful girl, isn't she?\"    No one of the five girls made answer. The little freshman regarded them  perplexedly.    \"Mm!\" ejaculated Muriel Harding. \"You wouldn't think her quite so nice  if you knew as much about her as we do. Wait until you see her play  basketball. She plays center on the sophomore team, and she makes some  very peculiar plays. She's always creating trouble, too. She and some of  her sophomore friends seem to have a particular grudge against Mignon.  They are forever criticising her playing. They have even gone so far as  to say that we don't play fairly; that we are tricky. The idea!\" Muriel  looked highly offended at the mere idea of any such thing.    Marjorie listened without comment. Muriel's ready tirade against the  pleasant-faced sophomore who had willingly offered her services that  morning made her feel decidedly uncomfortable. Then Miss Seymour's  straightforward speech to Miss Archer came back to her. The sophomore  had been generous to her enemies, if they were enemies, in that she had  refused to mention any names. Marjorie wondered if Muriel or Mignon  would be equally generous in the same circumstances. She resolved to say  nothing of what she had been privileged to hear. It was not hers to  tell.    Suddenly she divined, rather than saw, Mignon's elfish eyes fixed upon  her. \"You met another girl, at noon, did you not, Miss Dean?\" asked the  French girl, with an almost sarcastic inflection.    \"Yes; Miss Stevens,\" was the composed answer. \"We share the same locker.  She is a nice girl, too, and I like her very much, so, please, don't say  anything against her,\" she ended, in half-smiling warning.    Mignon La Salle's face grew dark. She recognized the challenging note in  the new girl's tone. Muriel, too, frowned. Susan Atwell sidled up to  Mignon, Irma Linton looked distressed and Geraldine Macy calmly curious  as to what would come next.

He was not sure he could draw his finger out of  the hole even if he wished to do so, it felt so strangely numb. What  did it mean that knives seemed to be cutting, and pins pricking him  from head to foot? What would happen if no one ever found him--no one  ever came to help?    At last the rose and silver of the dawn flushed the sky. Day had come  and along that lonesome road came the first traveller in all the hours  of Peter's vigil.    A clergyman whose night had been spent by the bedside of a sick  parishioner, hurrying homeward on the path beside the dyke, heard a  groan, a feeble sound of one in mortal agony. Turning, he glanced,  first here and there, and looking up, at last, he saw beside the dyke,  the figure of a child writhing in agony.    In a single bound, the clergyman stood beside him exclaiming:    \"In the name of wonder, boy, what are you doing here?\"    \"I am keeping the water from running out,\" said Peter. \"Oh, can't you  ask them to come _quick_.\"    And they did. The town of Haarlem, even Holland itself, had been saved,  through the courage of a little boy who did his duty, and from that day  to this there has never been a child in Holland who has not heard the  stirring story of Peter, whose pluck was worthy of a sluicer's son, and  whose name will never be forgotten, or effaced from the page of  historic legend.          DAVID:    The Shepherd Boy      A rare good fortune it is to have a friend so true and so faithful that  it is as safe to tell him a secret as to whisper it to yourself, one to  whom your interests are as important as his own, and who would do any  sort of unselfish act to show his devotion to you. It was just such a  comradeship as this which existed between two boys of long ago, the  story of whose intimacy has come down to us from Bible times as a most  wonderful example of what a friendship can be.    Those boys were David, the son of Jesse of Bethlehem, and Jonathan, the  son of Saul, King of Israel, and when you hear two persons spoken of as  \"a David and a Jonathan\" you may know that they are the closest kind of  friends.    To appreciate thoroughly the friendship between David and Jonathan, and  what it meant to both of them, let us go back a little into the history  of the time in which the boys lived, and look at the circumstances  which led up to their friendship, for that is very important to a clear  understanding of the story of David and Jonathan.    At that time the kingdom of Israel was in a deplorable condition, for  the Philistines, a war-like tribe who lived in a small territory on the  coast, had over-run and conquered most of Israel, and Samuel who was  the aged guide and advisor of the Israelites, as well as the last of  the judges and the first of the prophets of Israel, saw that the only  hope for his people lay in having a higher moral standard and a central  government. To bring this about, Samuel established the schools of the  prophets in Ramah and other cities, where men could be trained to teach  their nation how to live wiser, purer lives--and Samuel also anointed  Saul as King of Israel, and for a while Saul ruled wisely and well.  Then he disobeyed the command of God, and began to care for conquest in  war only when it brought him glory or the spoils of battles, and Samuel  seeing this, was much troubled, and finally went to Saul and told him  that he must repent and do differently or he would no longer be worthy  to be the King of Israel, that God demanded more honest service than he  was giving. Saul was considerably troubled at this plain speaking of  Samuel and promised to do better in future, but when Samuel left him,  it was with a heavy heart, for he felt sure that there would be need of  a new king--that Saul would not keep his promises.    And so Samuel at once began to look for a man whom he could anoint as  the future King, although no one knew of this purpose but himself, and  the voice of God within him inspired him to go to Bethlehem and seek  among the sons of Jesse for the King he wished to find. So Samuel went  to Bethlehem, but in order that the real purpose of his visit might not  be discovered, he took with him beside the horn of oil with which he  would anoint the new King if he should find him, also a young calf to  offer as a sacrifice, that he might have a suitable excuse to give to  the people for his visit.    Of course the coming of Samuel created a great excitement in the little  town of Bethlehem, for the people feared that he came to reprove them  for some wrong-doing, until Samuel assured them that this was not so,  that he came peaceably, and in proof of it invited them to the  sacrifice which he was preparing to offer on a hill just outside the  gate of the city. According to the rule of Oriental hospitality, it was  customary that some prominent man from the village should invite Samuel  to return to his home after offering the sacrifice, to break bread with  him and to pass the night under his roof if Samuel desired to do so,  and as Samuel had invited Jesse to the sacrifice, it came about quite  naturally that, as Samuel desired, it was Jesse's home to which the  aged Prophet went.    After they had arrived there, Samuel and Jesse sat and talked together  alone, for although Jesse had eight sons and two daughters, and they  were no longer children, the Eastern custom forbade a man's family to  enter his presence unless he expressly asked them to do so. And so  Samuel and Jesse were alone together, until Samuel asked Jesse if he  had no sons. Jesse replied that he had, and Samuel then requested to  see them. It was natural for a father to be pleased at such a request  and Jesse at once sent for Eliab, his eldest son, who promptly came  into the presence of his father and the aged Prophet, and Samuel looked  earnestly at the tall, handsome fellow, but a voice within him told  Samuel that Eliab was not the king-to-be, and after a brief talk with  the young man, he was dismissed, and Jesse called another and then  another of his sons, until Samuel had seen seven of them, but the  prophet only shook his head as he saw each one of them, for the voice  of inspiration or instinct said within him:    \"Neither hath the Lord chosen this.\" Then Samuel turned once more to  Jesse and asked:    \"Are here all thy children?\" And Jesse answered reluctantly:    \"There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold he keepeth the sheep.\"    Then Samuel bade Jesse send for David, which he did, and David, who was  as usual roaming with his flock in the Judean pasture-land, was greatly  surprised to see a messenger coming to him in breathless haste, and  still more was he surprised to receive his father's message that he was  to come home at once, as the prophet Samuel had asked to see him before  leaving. It was an unexpected command, but young David was always ready  for any emergency, and so, simply taking up his shepherd's staff, which  was a long stick with a handle crooked in such a way that by its aid  David could examine the limbs of his flock, or roll a sheep over with  it, when unruly and without further preparation, David accompanied the  messenger, although filled with wonder as to the reason for being  summoned to appear before the aged prophet Samuel.    See him as he enters his home and stands before Samuel, red-cheeked,  fair-skinned, glowing with health and happiness, with arms strong  enough to break a bow of steel, and with limbs like a deer's in their  swiftness to escape a foe or to scale a wall. Sturdy and fearless he  stood before Samuel, the picture of youthful vigour and courage, and  when Samuel had scarcely more than glanced at him, the voice of God  spoke within the prophet saying:    \"Arise, anoint him, for this is he.\"    Then Samuel rose with simple earnestness and laid a hand on David's  shoulder, looking long and solemnly into the clear bright eyes which  answered his glance, then more solemnly still, Samuel took up the horn  of oil which he had brought with him, and with the customary ceremony,  anointed David, the fair-haired young shepherd boy, to be the future  King of Israel. As only kings were anointed and Samuel always performed  this ceremony, Jesse could not have failed to understand the solemn  rite, although he must have marvelled over it, wondering why it should  be performed over this, his youngest and least important son.  Doubtless, although the Bible narrative does not tell us so, the aged  prophet later spoke to Jesse of the meaning of his act, and one can  imagine Jesse's flutter of heart at the thought that one of his boys  should have been chosen to fill such a great position. David also,  young as he was, must have understood in some measure what the ceremony  meant, although he must have been completely at a loss to understand  how he, a mere child, could be the Lord's anointed. Probably, like any  other boy of to-day, he wanted to ask questions, but there was not the  freedom allowed young people in those days that there is now and David,  looking from the awe-struck face of his father, to the solemn one of  the prophet, doubtless kept silent. Then with an appropriately  reverential farewell to the aged prophet he must have been sent from  the presence of Jesse and Samuel, sent back again to his accustomed  task and to await the fulfilling of that destiny which, from the moment  when he thrilled at the touch of the prophet's hand on his head, and  the sound of his solemn words, he felt sure was in some way to link his  life in consecrated service to that of the people of Israel.    But that belief did not alter his conduct in his daily routine of duty,  and with the faithfulness which was one of his marked characteristics,  he continued to care for his sheep, tending them with increased  watchfulness under the stimulus of his new day-dream.
