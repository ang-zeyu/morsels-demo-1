There was a horrible panic when her presence became known, and  men ran hither and thither vainly seeking to attack her; yet there was  less terror among them than before when they saw the figure of a  horrible woman. In spite of all, the monster seized Aschere, one of  King Hrothgar's thanes, and bore him away to the fens, leaving a house  of lamentation where men had feasted so joyously a few hours before.  The news was brought to King Hrothgar, who bitterly lamented the loss  of his wisest and dearest counsellor, and bade them call Beowulf to  him, since he alone could help in this extremity. When Beowulf stood  before the king he courteously inquired if his rest had been peaceful.  Hrothgar answered mournfully: \"Ask me not of peace, for care is  renewed in Heorot. Dead is Aschere, my best counsellor and friend, the  truest of comrades in fight and in council. Such as Aschere was should  a true vassal be! A deadly fiend has slain him in Heorot, and I know  not whither she has carried his lifeless body. This is doubtless her  vengeance for thy slaying of Grendel; he is dead, and his kinswoman  has come to avenge him.\"        \"I have heard it reported    by some of my people      That they have looked on    two such unearthly ones,      Huge-bodied march-striders    holding the moor wastes;      One of them seemed to be    shaped like a woman,      Her fellow in exile    bore semblance of manhood,      Though huger his stature    than man ever grew to:      In years that are long gone by    Grendel they named him,      But know not his father    nor aught of his kindred.      Thus these dire monsters    dwell in the secret lands,      Haunt the hills loved by wolves,    the windy nesses,      Dangerous marshy paths,    where the dark moorland stream      'Neath the o'erhanging cliffs    downwards departeth,      Sinks in the sombre earth.    Not far remote from us      Standeth the gloomy mere,    round whose shores cluster      Groves with their branches mossed,    hoary with lichens grey      A wood firmly rooted    o'ershadows the water.      There is a wonder seen    nightly by wanderers,      Flame in the waterflood:    liveth there none of men      Ancient or wise enough    to know its bottom.      Though the poor stag may be    hard by the hounds pursued,      Though he may seek the wood,    chased by his cruel foes,      Yet will he yield his life    to hunters on the brink      Ere he will hide his head    in the dark waters.      'Tis an uncanny place.    Thence the surge swelleth up      Dark to the heavens above,    when the wind stirreth oft      Terrible driving storms,    till the air darkens,      The skies fall to weeping.\"    Then Hrothgar burst forth in uncontrollable emotion: \"O Beowulf, help  us if thou canst! Help is only to be found in thee. But yet thou  knowest not the dangerous place thou must needs explore if thou seek  the fiend in her den. I will richly reward thy valour if thou  returnest alive from this hazardous journey.\"    Beowulf was touched by the sorrow of the grey-haired king, and  replied:        \"Grieve not, O prudent King!    Better it is for each      That he avenge his friend,    than that he mourn him much.      Each man must undergo    death at the end of life.      Let him win while he may    warlike fame in the world!      That is best after death    for the slain warrior.\"    \"Arise, my lord; let us scan the track left by the monster, for I  promise thee I will never lose it, wheresoever it may lead me. Only  have patience yet for this one day of misery, as I am sure thou wilt.\"    Hrothgar sprang up joyously, almost youthfully, and ordered his horse  to be saddled; then, with Beowulf beside him, and a mixed throng of  Geats and Danes following, he rode away towards the home of the  monsters, the dread lake which all men shunned. The blood-stained  tracks were easy to see, and the avengers moved on swiftly till they  came to the edge of the mere, and there, with grief and horror, saw  the head of Aschere lying on the bank.    [Illustration: Beowulf finds the head of Aschere]        \"The lake boiled with blood,    with hot welling gore;      The warriors gazed awe-struck,    and the dread horn sang      From time to time fiercely    eager defiance.      The warriors sat down there,    and saw on the water      The sea-dragons swimming    to search the abysses.      They saw on the steep nesses    sea-monsters lying,      Snakes and weird creatures:    these madly shot away      Wrathful and venomous    when the sound smote their ears,      The blast of the war-horn.\"    As Beowulf stood on the shore and watched the uncouth sea-creatures,  serpents, nicors, monstrous beasts of all kinds, he suddenly drew his  bow and shot one of them to the heart. The rest darted furiously away,  and the thanes were able to drag the carcase of the slain beast on  shore, where they surveyed it with wonder.      The Fight with Grendel's Mother    Meanwhile Beowulf had made ready for his task. He trusted to his  well-woven mail, the corslet fitting closely to his body and  protecting his breast, the shining helm guarding his head, bright with  the boar-image on the crest, and the mighty sword Hrunting, which  Hunferth, his jealousy forgotten in admiration, pressed on the  adventurous hero.        \"That sword was called Hrunting,    an ancient heritage.      Steel was the blade itself,    tempered with poison-twigs,      Hardened with battle-blood:    never in fight it failed      Any who wielded it,    when he would wage a strife      In the dire battlefield,    folk-moot of enemies.\"    When Beowulf stood ready with naked sword in hand, he turned and  looked at his loyal followers, his friendly hosts, the grey old King  Hrothgar, the sun and the green earth, which he might never see again;  but it was with no trace of weakness or fear that he spoke:        \"Forget not, O noble    kinsman of Healfdene,      Illustrious ruler,    gold-friend of warriors,      What we two settled    when we spake together,      If I for thy safety should    end here my life-days,      That thou wouldst be to me,    though dead, as a father.      Be to my kindred thanes,    my battle-comrades,      A worthy protector    should death o'ertake me.      Do thou, dear Hrothgar,    send all these treasures here      Which thou hast given me,    to my king, Hygelac.      Then may the Geat king,    brave son of Hrethel dead,      See by the gold and gems,    know by the treasures there,      That I found a generous lord,    whom I loved in my life.      Give thou to Hunferth too    my wondrous old weapon,      The sword with its graven blade;    let the right valiant man      Have the keen war-blade:    I will win fame with his,      With Hrunting, noble brand,    or death shall take me.\"    Beowulf dived downward, as it seemed to him, for the space of a day  ere he could perceive the floor of that sinister lake, and all that  time he had to fight the sea-beasts, for they, attacking him with tusk  and horn, strove to break his ring-mail, but in vain. As Beowulf came  near the bottom he felt himself seized in long, scaly arms of gigantic  strength. The fierce claws of the wolfish sea-woman strove eagerly to  reach his heart through his mail, but in vain; so the she-wolf of the  waters, a being awful and loathsome, bore him to her abode, rushing  through thick clusters of horrible sea-beasts.        \"The hero now noticed    he was in some hostile hall,      Where him the water-stream    no whit might injure,      Nor for the sheltering roof    the rush of the raging flood      Ever could touch him.    He saw the strange flickering flame,      Weird lights in the water,    shining with livid sheen:      He saw, too, the ocean-wolf,    the hateful sea-woman.\"    Terrible and almost superhuman was the contest which now followed: the  awful sea-woman flung Beowulf down on his back and stabbed at him with  point and edge of her broad knife, seeking some vulnerable point; but  the good corslet resisted all her efforts, and Beowulf, exerting his  mighty force, overthrew her and sprang to his feet. Angered beyond  measure, he brandished the flaming sword Hrunting, and flashed one  great blow at her head which would have killed her had her scales and  hair been vulnerable; but alas! the edge of the blade turned on her  scaly hide, and the blow failed. Wrathfully Beowulf cast aside the  useless sword, and determined to trust once again to his hand-grip.  Grendel's mother now felt, in her turn, the deadly power of Beowulf's  grasp, and was borne to the ground; but the struggle continued long,  for Beowulf was weaponless, since the sword failed in its work. Yet  some weapon he must have.        \"So he gazed at the walls,    saw there a glorious sword,      An old brand gigantic,    trusty in point and edge,      An heirloom of heroes;    that was the best of blades,      Splendid and stately,    the forging of giants;      But it was huger than    any of human race      Could bear to battle-strife,    save Beowulf only.\"    This mighty sword, a relic of earlier and greater races, brought new  hope to Beowulf. Springing up, he snatched it from the wall and swung  it fiercely round his head. The blow fell with crushing force on the  neck of the sea-woman, the dread wolf of the abyss, and broke the  bones. Dead the monster sank to the ground, and Beowulf, standing  erect, saw at his feet the lifeless carcase of his foe. The hero still  grasped his sword and looked warily along the walls of the  water-dwelling, lest some other foe should emerge from its recesses;  but as he gazed Beowulf saw his former foe, Grendel, lying dead on a  bed in some inner hall. He strode thither, and, seizing the corpse by  the hideous coiled locks, shore off the head to carry to earth again.  The poisonous hot blood of the monster melted the blade of the mighty  sword, and nothing remained but the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25529"],[0,"The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse (#8)"],[1,"Rabbit.

But just as anybody can make a  mistake sometimes, so can everybody. Still, in this case, it is  quite likely that everybody is right. Danny Meadow Mouse is  timid. Ask Peter Rabbit. Ask Sammy Jay. Ask Striped Chipmunk.  They will all tell you the same thing. Sammy Jay might even tell  you that Danny is afraid of his own shadow, or that he tries to  run away from his own tail. Of course this isn't true. Sammy Jay  likes to say mean things. It isn't fair to Danny Meadow Mouse to  believe what Sammy Jay says.    But the fact is Danny certainly is timid. More than this, he  isn't ashamed of it--not the least little bit.    \"You see, it's this way,\" said Danny, as he sat on his doorstep  one sunny morning talking to his friend, old Mr. Toad. \"If I  weren't afraid, I wouldn't be all the time watching out, and if  I weren't all the time watching out, I wouldn't have any more  chance than that foolish red ant running across in front of you.\"    Old Mr. Toad looked where Danny was pointing, and his tongue  darted out and back again so quickly that Danny wasn't sure that  he saw it at all, but when he looked for the ant it was nowhere  to be seen, and there was a satisfied twinkle in Mr. Toad's eyes.  There was an answering twinkle in Danny's own eyes as he  continued.    \"No, Sir,\" said he, \"I wouldn't stand a particle more chance than  that foolish ant did. Now if I were big and strong, like Old Man  Coyote, or had swift wings, like Skimmer the Swallow, or were so  homely and ugly looking that no one wanted me, like--like--\"  Danny hesitated and then finished rather lamely, \"like some folks  I know, I suppose I wouldn't be afraid.\"    Old Mr. Toad looked up sharply when Danny mentioned homely and  ugly-looking people, but Danny was gazing far out across the  Green Meadows and looked so innocent that Mr. Toad concluded that  he couldn't have had him in mind.    \"Well,\" said he, thoughtfully scratching his nose, \"I suppose  you may be right, but for my part fear seems a very foolish  thing. Now, I don't know what it is. I mind my own business, and  no one ever bothers me. I should think it would be a very  uncomfortable feeling.\"    \"It is,\" replied Danny, \"but, as I said before, it is a very good  thing to keep one on guard when there are as many watching for  one as there are for me. Now there's Mr. Blacksnake and--\"    \"Where?\" exclaimed old Mr. Toad, turning as pale as a toad can  turn, and looking uneasily and anxiously in every direction.    [Illustration: _\"Where?\" exclaimed old Mr. Toad, turning as pale  as a toad can turn_]    Danny turned his head to hide a smile. If old Mr. Toad wasn't  showing fear, no one ever did. \"Oh,\" said he, \"I didn't mean that  he is anywhere around here now. What I was going to say was that  there is Mr. Blacksnake and Granny Fox and Reddy Fox and Redtail  the Hawk and Hooty the Owl and others I might name, always  watching for a chance to make a dinner from poor little me. Do  you wonder that I am afraid most of the time?\"    \"No,\" replied old Mr. Toad. \"No, I don't wonder that you are  afraid. It must be dreadful to feel hungry eyes are watching for  you every minute of the day and night, too.\"    \"Oh, it's not so bad,\" replied Danny. \"It's rather exciting.  Besides, it keeps my wits sharp all the time. I am afraid I  should find life very dull indeed if, like you, I feared nothing  and nobody. By the way, see how queerly that grass is moving over  there. It looks as if Mr. Blacksnake--Why, Mr. Toad, where are  you going in such a hurry?\"    [Illustration: _\"Why, Mr. Toad, where are you going in such a  hurry?\" asked Danny_]    \"I've just remembered an important engagement with my cousin,  Grandfather Frog, at the Smiling Pool,\" shouted old Mr. Toad  over his shoulder, as he hurried so that he fell over his own  feet.    Danny chuckled as he sat alone on his doorstep. \"Oh, no, old Mr.  Toad doesn't know what fear is!\" said he. \"Funny how some people  won't admit what everybody can see for themselves. Now, I am  afraid, and I'm willing to say so.\"    [Illustration]                                       XXI               An Exciting Day for Danny Meadow Mouse      Danny Meadow Mouse started along one of his private little paths  very early one morning. He was on his way to get a supply of a  certain kind of grass seed of which he is very fond. He had been  thinking about that seed for some time and waiting for it to get  ripe. Now it was just right, as he had found out the day before  by a visit to the place where this particular grass grew. The  only trouble was it grew a long way from Danny's home, and to  reach it he had to cross an open place where the grass was so  short that he couldn't make a path under it.    \"I feel it in my bones that this is going to be an exciting day,\"  said Danny to himself as he trotted along. \"I suppose that if I  were really wise, I would stay nearer home and do without that  nice seed. But nothing is really worth having unless it is worth  working for, and that seed will taste all the better if I have  hard work getting it.\"    So he trotted along his private little path, his ears wide open,  and his eyes wide open, and his little nose carefully testing  every Merry Little Breeze who happened along for any scent of  danger which it might carry. Most of all he depended upon his  ears, for the grass was so tall that he couldn't see over it,  even when he sat up. He had gone only a little way when he  thought he heard a queer rustling behind him. He stopped to  listen. There it was again, and it certainly was right in the  path behind him! He didn't need to be told who was making it.  There was only one who could make such a sound as that--Mr.  Blacksnake.    Now Danny can run very fast along his private little paths, but  he knew that Mr. Blacksnake could run faster. \"If my legs can't  save me, my wits must,\" thought Danny as he started to run as  fast as ever he could. \"I must reach that fallen old hollow fence  post.\"    He was almost out of breath when he reached the post and scurried  into the open end. He knew by the sound of the rustling that Mr.  Blacksnake was right at his heels. Now the old post was hollow  its whole length, but halfway there was an old knothole just big  enough for Danny to squeeze through. Mr. Blacksnake didn't know  anything about that hole, and because it was dark inside the old  post, he didn't see Danny pop through it. Danny ran back along  the top of the log and was just in time to see the tip of Mr.  Blacksnake's tail disappear inside. Then what do you think Danny  did? Why, he followed Mr. Blacksnake right into the old post, but  in doing it he didn't make the least little bit of noise.    Mr. Blacksnake kept right on through the old post and out the  other end, for he was sure that that was the way Danny had gone.  He kept right on along the little path. Now Danny knew that he  wouldn't go very far before he found out that he had been fooled,  and of course he would come back. So Danny waited only long  enough to get his breath and then ran back along the path to  where another little path branched off. For just a minute he  paused.    \"If Mr. Blacksnake follows me, he will be sure to think that of  course I have taken this other little path,\" thought Danny, \"so I  won't do it.\"    Then he ran harder than ever, until he came to a place where two  little paths branched off, one to the right and one to the left.  He took the latter and scampered on, sure that by this time Mr.  Blacksnake would be so badly fooled that he would give up the  chase. And Danny was right.        \"_Brains are better far than speed      As wise men long ago agreed,_\"    said Danny, as he trotted on his way for the grass seed he liked  so well. \"I felt it in my bones that this would be an exciting  day. I wonder what next.\"                                      XXII              What Happened Next to Danny Meadow Mouse      Danny is so used to narrow escapes that he doesn't waste any time  thinking about them. He didn't this time. \"He who tries to look  two ways at once is pretty sure to see nothing,\" says Danny, and  he knew that if he thought too much about the things that had  already happened, he couldn't keep a sharp watch for the things  that might happen.    Nothing more happened as he hurried along his private little path  to the edge of a great patch of grass so short that he couldn't  hide under it. He had to cross this, and all the way he would be  in plain sight of anyone who happened to be near. Very cautiously  he peeped out and looked this way and looked that way, not  forgetting to look up in the sky. He could see no one anywhere.  Drawing a long breath, Danny started across the open place as  fast as his short legs could take him.    Now all the time, Redtail the Hawk had been sitting in a tree  some distance away, sitting so still that he looked like a part  of the tree itself. That is why Danny hadn't seen him. But  Redtail saw Danny the instant he started across the open place,  for Redtail's eyes are very keen, and he can see a great  distance. With a satisfied chuckle, he spread his broad wings and  started after Danny.    Just about halfway to the safety of the long grass on the other  side, Danny gave a hurried look behind him, and his heart seemed  to jump right into his mouth, for there was Redtail with his  cruel claws already set to seize him! Danny gave a frightened  squeak, for he thought that surely this time he would be caught.  But he didn't mean to give up without trying to escape. Three  jumps ahead of him was a queer-looking thing. He didn't know what  it was, but if there was a hole in it he might yet fool Redtail.    [Illustration: _With a frightened squeak, Danny dived into the  opening just in "]]]
