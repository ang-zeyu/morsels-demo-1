Porphyry, born at Tyre in 233, wrote a book  against them, which was burned by order of Theodosius the Great, in the  year 304. (Zell's Encyclopedia.)    The Emperor Julian, born in the year 331, and Hierocles, who lived in  the fourth century, both wrote against Christianity, against the  Scriptures, but did not call in question the existence of Christ, nor  the fact that he wrought miracles.    Celsus, an Epicurean philosopher who lived in the second century, was  the author of a work written against Christianity, entitled \"Logos  Aleethees,\" that is, \"Word of Truth.\" To this work Origen replied.  Celsus, in this work, quotes from the gospels by Matthew, Mark, Luke and  John, and does this over and over, and shows that the Christians valued  the books very highly; they suffered death rather than repudiate them.    A TABLE OF THE ANCIENT TIMES OF TRIAL AND OF PEACE.      DATE--      A.D. 64 to  68--Persecution under Nero.          95 to  96--Persecution under Domitian. Banishment of John.          96 to 104--Time of peace.         104 to 117--Persecution under Trajan. Martyrdom of Ignatius.         117 to 161--Time of peace. Apologies of Aristides,                       Quadratus and Justin Martyr were written.         161 to 180--Persecution under Marcus Aurelius. Martyrdom                       of Polycarp and the martyrs of                       Lyons.                164--Justin Martyr was put to death.    Statistics concerning the sufferings of the first Christians show that  they were in great earnest. Eternity alone will reveal the true number  of the martyrs. They all suffered and died just as we would expect, in  case they knew the facts of our religion. Twenty-two books of the New  Testament were written before the martyrdom of the Apostles Paul and  Peter. Infidels often boast, in their ignorance, that the books of the  gospels were not written by those whose names they bear.    If Matthew, Mark, Luke and John did not write those books which bear  their names, then are they false in fact? and if so, what did the  authors die for? The sufferings of primitive Christians were great; the  persecutions which they endured were outrageous, cruel and inhuman in  their character. Such is the universal verdict of ancient history. Of  the persecution under Nero, Tacitus, a celebrated Roman historian, who  was born in the year 56, just twenty-three years after Pentecost,  writes, that Nero \"laid upon the Christians the charge of that terrible  conflagration at Rome of which he himself was the cause.\" He says, \"A  vast multitude were apprehended. And many were disguised in the skins of  wild beasts and worried to death by dogs, some were crucified, and  others were wrapped in pitched shirts and set on fire when the day  closed, that they might serve as lights to illuminate the night. Nero  lent his own garden for these executions, and celebrated at the same  time a public entertainment in the circus, being a spectator of the  whole in the dress of a charioteer, sometimes mingling with the crowd on  foot, and sometimes viewing the spectacle from his car.\" (Annals of  Tacitus, 15: 44.)    Juvenal, the coarse and bitter satirist of the same time, writes of the  martyred Christians as \"those who stand burning in their own flame and  smoke, their head being held up by a stake fixed to their chin, till  they make a long stream of blood and sulphur on the ground.\" (Juv. Sat.,  1: 155.)    Seneca also refers to their fearful sufferings: \"Imagine here a prison,  crosses and racks and the hook, and a stake thrust through the body and  coming out at the mouth, and the limbs torn by chariots pulling adverse  ways, and the coat besmeared and interwoven with inflammable materials,  nutriment for fire, and whatever else beside _these_ cruelty has  invented.\" (Seneca's Epistles, 14.)    One of Diocletian's coins commemorates the blotting out of the very name  of Christian: \"Nomine Christianorum deleto.\" But the age of martyrdoms  ended with the accession of Constantine to the Roman empire, and to-day  there are more Christians in the world than ever before. Skeptic, take  one long look at the unbelieving, bloody, persecuting hosts, and choose  your future associates.    Strauss says: \"No man knows who wrote the Gospels.\" Can he mean that  they are anonymous books? Does he mean that they are not  biographies--books containing, in their historic matter, an account of  the authors _themselves_? Who does not know that those books are and  have been called the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John? And who  has, in all the past centuries, produced evidence showing that those are  the wrong names. No one. Insane men might say such a thing. Infidels  don't like to say that; they just say you can't prove your religion, nor  show that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John wrote those books. Will any  sensible man affirm that they are the wrong names? How do we judge and  believe respecting the authorship of other ancient books? Why do we  believe that Caesar wrote the Commentaries on the Gallic War? And why do  we believe that Virgil wrote the AEneid? No sane man ever doubted the  authorship of those writings. Preoccupancy during the ages past is  considered by infidels themselves a sufficient ground for belief. The  fact that those books exist has certainly been known from the age of the  apostles to the present time, for men quoted extensively from them in  the second century. The names they bear were in the possessive case  then, and it is but fair to consider them the true owners.    Why are skeptics and infidels so partial among ancient books? They doubt  the authorship of no ancient books unless they are written in favor of  the religion of Christ. Will some wise one tell us why this strange  inconsistency? O, it is an evidence of a wicked heart--that's all!  all!!--ALL THERE IS OF IT!!!

One feels, indeed, as if it were  not Hebrew--such a noble universality, different from noble patriotism  or sectarianism, reigns in it. A noble book! All men's book! It is our  first, oldest statement of the never-ending problem of man's destiny and  God's ways with him here on this earth, and all in such free, flowing  outlines, grand in its simplicity and its epic melody and repose of  reconcilement! There is the seeing eye, the mildly understanding heart.  So true every way; true eye-sight and vision for all things--material  things no less than spiritual; the horse--'thou hast clothed his neck  with thunder;' 'he laughs at the shaking of the spear!' Such living  likenesses were never since drawn. Sublime sorrow! Sublime  reconciliation! Oldest choral melody, as of the heart of mankind! So  soft and great, as the summer midnight, as the world with its seas and  stars! There is nothing written, I think, in the Bible or out of it, of  equal literary merit.\" (Dr. Cotton's Scrap-Book.)          WHAT I LIVE FOR.      \"I live to hold communion      With all that is divine,    To feel there is a union      Between God's will and mine;    For the cause that lacks assistance,      For the future, in the distance,    For what'er is good and true,      For all human hearts that bind me,    For the task by God assigned me,      And the good that I can do.\"          THE MOLECULE GOD.

(#8)"],[1,"is equal to something made of nothing. Mr.  Darwin, being apprised of this difficulty, claimed a miraculous origin  for the first form, or forms, of life, but retired the Creator at once  upon the great achievement, leaving all to be evolved from these first  forms by and through natural agencies, denying even design in nature.  Mr. Buckner, a bold advocate of the \"spontaneous generation\" of life,  who has published two volumes on Darwinism, says Darwin's views \"are the  most thoroughly naturalistic that can be imagined, and far more  atheistic than those of his predecessor, Lamark, who admitted, at least,  a general law of progress and development; whereas, according to Darwin,  the whole development is due to the gradual summation of innumerable  minute and accidental operations.\" It is admitted that the doctrine of  evolution of species from other and entirely different species is a mere  hypothesis, an opinion, _or guess_.    What have we to gain by the adoption of this unknown factor in the  vegetable and animal _kingdoms_? Answer, nothing but _irreligion_; a  world of godless infidels tearing afresh the wounds that death has  made, and restoring to the grave its victory over the human heart.  Renan, in his recent lectures talks about the \"torture consequent upon  the disappointment in his efforts to attain to the unattainable;\" and  Strauss said the \"sense of abandonment is at first something awful.\"  This is the inheritance that the tenet of evolution leaves to all  infidels in their last extremity.          WHEN SHOULD CHILDREN BECOME CHURCH MEMBERS?      We have looked with great anxiety upon the efforts being put forth in  our Sunday-schools, believing that they would result in bringing  intelligent Christians from the extremes into which they have fallen by  means of the controversy going on upon the subject of infant church  membership; but it seems that there is great need of some one to speak  out against the old, fossilized ideas touching this subject. And at the  risk of being faulted we shall say our piece. First, The Apostle John  addresses a class of Christians which he terms \"little children,\"  classifying them in contradistinction from young men and fathers. He  says, \"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven  you for his name's sake.\" This class included neither young men nor  fathers, for John addresses young men and fathers as separate and  distinct classes.    Jesus also recognized this class of disciples by saying, \"Better were it  for a man that a mill-stone be hanged about his neck, and he be drowned  in the depths of the sea than for him to offend one of these little ones  which _believe in me_.\"--_Matt. 18._    Second, The gospel of Christ undoubtedly reaches the lowest capacity of  responsible creatures, and just where the ability to believe in Christ  and commence a Christian life comes in, there responsibility comes in,  whether that be at eight, ten, or any other year in the child's  history. We can not conceive of a sinner in youth without a Savior  provided, nor of a sinner in childhood without the gospel privilege of  becoming a member of the body of Christ.    Fathers and mothers, where are your children? Are they reading novels  between Sundays, and all other kinds of literature? Are they believing  this, that, and the other story, which they read?    Are they old enough and wise enough to know what is wrong? Do they know  what is right? Have you taught them? If you have, that settles one  important question, viz.: are they teachable? If they are not, of course  you have not taught them. Well, teach them the knowledge of our Lord  just as soon as you can, as soon as they are teachable, and then point  them to the Savior of men, for they are then old enough and wise enough  to become Christians. The gospel of the blessed Savior is so loaded down  with divine mercy that it simplifies its requirements to faith in the  Lord Jesus Christ and obedience to his will. But ability measures  responsibility, and where ability begins responsibility begins, and as  ability increases responsibility also increases.    I am, and have been, for many years, satisfied that a great and grievous  wrong exists on both sides of the question of infant church membership.  First, no one can be a member of the body of Christ who is incapable of  enjoying spiritual union with Christ through faith and submission to his  will, for \"he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.\" So membership  in the body of Christ is, so far as unteachable babes are concerned, a  _misnomer_. On the other side, the neglect to teach children when they  are teachable, and to instruct them to come to Christ in their  childhood, when they can come in faith, is a great and grievous wrong.  Will not all our brethren speak out upon this subject? _Brethren, let us  have no laziness here!_ Where a soul finds condemnation there the gospel  finds it.          OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO THE JEWS.      It is the business of mind to follow facts and mark their results. The  Jewish nation had an existence prior to the Augustan or Athenian age,  and was far ahead of either in civilization and morality. The Jewish  people have often been reprobated, as a people almost without  literature, art and civilization, but we are persuaded that it is base  ingratitude upon the part of any scholar living in a civilized land to  speak of that ancient family thus in terms of reproach. What are the  scriptures of the Old and New Testaments but Hebrew productions? It  certainly corresponds with infidelity to speak contemptuously of the  people who, more than all others, were under the influence of those  scriptures for ages in the past, and who were the chosen people through  whom they were to be given to the world of mankind. The Hieroglyphics of  Egypt, and the Classics of Greece, are perishable monuments constructed  in memory of intelligence and civilization, when compared with the  undying influence of the Bible upon the hearts of the millions who  resort to it to find their way through life. For one edition of the  classics we have had ten thousand Bibles. Why is this?    Men of the profoundest wisdom have investigated the claims of the Bible  upon the attention of the literary and scientific, upon the attention of  the moral and civil in every nation. They tell us that its morality and  theology are far superior to the teachings of any and all of the ancient  teachings of the greatest known philosophers, and that the writings of  those philosophers are much inferior to those of Moses and the prophets.  The poetry and philosophy of the Hebrews, as presented in the Bible,  surpasses Homer and Aristotle. And their independent religion, existing  amidst the heathenism of the surrounding pagan nations, was the only  religion calculated, by virtue of its \"one God\" to worship, to unite the  human family in one great brotherhood. It is conceded upon all sides  that the Bible is the most remarkable book that the world ever read.  How base and unjust is it, therefore, to be speaking reproachfully of  the Hebrews as a nation. We should remember them with great kindness for  the inestimable treasures of wisdom and knowledge handed to the people  of the ages through them. To them the whole Christian world is indebted  for its morality and civilization. Even Thomas Paine got his notions of  civil government from the Pentateuch. If you doubt this read his work  entitled \"Common Sense,\" and you will doubt it no more.    Jewish writings and American life and character are very intimately  blended, and we can not separate them without being guilty of great  injustice. \"If British, Scottish, Roman, Saxon, Danish and Norman blood  runs through our veins, our minds have been cast in a Hebrew mould.\" To  this cause we owe the most of our greatness as a nation.          THE SECOND FIVE POINTS IN CALVINISM, WITH TWO OTHER FIVES.      Some one has submitted the second five points in Calvinism. Here they  are:    _First_--If you seek religion you can't find it.    _Second_--If you find it you don't know it.    _Third_--If you know it you haven't got it.    _Fourth_--If you have got it you can't lose it.    _Fifth_--If you lose it you never had it.      --_Virginia Missionary._      THE FIVE POINTS OF METHODISM.    _First_--God is able to give religion to all the world.    _Second_--If you seek it you can find it.    _Third_--If you find it you are sure to know it.    _Fourth_--If you don't know it, you haven't got it.    _Fifth_--If you lose it you can easily find it.      FIVE POINTS IN THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST    _First_--The gospel is the embodiment of the religion of Jesus Christ.    _Second_--God gave it as a system of good news, to the whole human  family.    _Third_--If you lay hold upon it by faith you have it.    _Fourth_--If you have it, and will obey it in your every day life, you  will enjoy it.    _Fifth_--If you don't enjoy it, it is because you don't obey it.          BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S EPITAPH AS THE EXPONENT OF HIS FAITH.    [Copy, from the _Virginia Missionary_ of August 12th, 1880.]      A correspondent of the _Inter-Ocean_ not long since sent the following  comment upon Ingersoll's claim that Benjamin Franklin was an infidel:    \"As Col. Ingersoll appears to be trying to appropriate our old and  esteemed friend, Benjamin Franklin, as a recruit for his infidel  doctrine, let me call his attention, through your widely circulated  journal, to the following epitaph, written by himself for himself:               \"'The body of           Benjamin Franklin,                Printer,       Lies here food for worms,     Like the cover of an old book,    Its contents torn out and stripped       Of its lettering and gilding;                But it will             (As he believed)             Appear again, in a           New and more beautiful           Edition, corrected and                Amended by              THE AUTHOR.'\"        "]]]
