His comings and his goings       Are to and from the presence of God.    \"If it is asserted,\" he argued, \"that King Wen was really in the  presence of God, and that there really is such a Being as God, He  certainly cannot have the form in which He is represented by the clay  or wooden images in vogue. Still, as these statements were made by the  Prophets of old, there must have been some foundation for them.\"    There is, however, a certain amount of inconsistency in his writings on  the supernatural, for in another passage he says,    \"When God is about to send down calamities upon us, He first raises up  the hero whose genius shall finally prevail against those calamities.\"    Sometimes he seems to be addressing the educated Confucianist; at other  times, the common herd whose weaknesses have to be taken into account.        CHAPTER V -- BUDDHISM AND OTHER RELIGIONS    So early as the third century B.C., Buddhism seems to have appeared in  China, though it was not until the latter part of the first century A.D.  that a regular propaganda was established, and not until a century or  two later still that this religion began to take a firm hold of the  Chinese people. It was bitterly opposed by the Taoists, and only after  the lapse of many centuries were the two doctrines able to exist side  by side in peace. Each religion began early to borrow from the other. In  the words of the philosopher Chu Hsi, of the twelfth century, \"Buddhism  stole the best features of Taoism; Taoism stole the worst features of  Buddhism. It is as though one took a jewel from the other, and the loser  recouped the loss with a stone.\"    From Buddhism the Taoists borrowed their whole scheme of temples,  priests, nuns, and ritual. They drew up liturgies to resemble the  Buddhist _Sutras_, and also prayers for the dead. They adopted the  idea of a Trinity, consisting of Lao Tzu, P'an Ku, and the Ruler of the  Universe; and they further appropriated the Buddhist Purgatory with all  its frightful terrors and tortures after death.    Nowadays it takes an expert to distinguish between the temples and  priests of the two religions, and members of both hierarchies are often  simultaneously summoned by persons needing religious consolation or  ceremonial of any kind.    Doubts.--In a chapter on \"Doubts,\" by the Taoist philosopher Mou Tzu, we  read,    \"Some one said to Mou, The Buddhist doctrine teaches that when men die  they are born again. I cannot believe this.    \"When a man is at the point of death, replied Mou, his family mount upon  the house-top and call to him to stay. If he is already dead, to whom do  they call?    \"They call his soul, said the other.    \"If the soul comes back, the man lives, answered Mou; but if it does  not, whither does it go?    \"It becomes a disembodied spirit, was the reply.    \"Precisely so, said Mou. The soul is imperishable; only the body decays,  just as the stalks of corn perish, while the grain continues for ever  and ever. Did not Lao Tzu say, 'The reason why I suffer so much is  because I have a body'?    \"But all men die whether they have found the truth or not, urged the  questioner; what then is the difference between them?    \"That, replied Mou, is like considering your reward before you have put  in right conduct for a single day. If a man has found the truth, even  though he dies, his spirit will go to heaven; if he has led an evil life  his spirit will suffer everlastingly. A fool knows when a thing is done,  but a wise man knows beforehand. To have found the truth and not to have  found it are as unlike as gold and leather; good and evil, as black and  white. How then can you ask what is the difference?\"    Buddhism, which forbids the slaughter of any living creature, has wisely  abstained from denouncing the sacrifice of victims at the Temple of  Heaven and at the Confucian Temple. But backed by Confucianism it  denounces the slaughter for food of the ox which tills the soil. Some  lines of doggerel to this effect, based upon the Buddhist doctrine of  the transmigration of souls and put into the mouth of an ox, have been  rendered as follows:--         My murderers shall come to grief,       Along with all who relish beef;       When I'm a man and you're a cow,       I'll eat you as you eat me now.    Fire Worshippers.--Mazdeism, the religion of Zoroaster, based upon the  worship of fire, and in that sense not altogether unfamiliar to the  Chinese, reached China some time in the seventh century A.D. The first  temple was built at Ch'ang-an, the capital, in 621, ten years after  which came the famous missionary, Ho Lu the Magus. But the lease of life  enjoyed by this religion was of short duration.    Islamism.--Mahometans first settled in China in the year of the Mission,  A.D. 628, under Wahb-Abi-Kabcha, a maternal uncle of Mahomet, who was  sent with presents to the Emperor. The first mosque was built at Canton,  where, after several restorations, it still exists. There is at present  a very large Mahometan community in China, chiefly in the province of  Yunnan. These people carry on their worship unmolested, on the sole  condition that in each mosque there shall be exhibited a small tablet  with an inscription, the purport of which is recognition of allegiance  to the reigning Emperor.    Nestorians.--In A.D. 631 the Nestorian Church introduced Christianity  into China, under the title of \"The Luminous Doctrine;\" and in 636  Nestorian missionaries were allowed to settle at the capital. In 781  the famous Nestorian Tablet, with a bilingual inscription in Chinese and  Syriac, was set up at Si-ngan Fu, where it still remains, and where it  was discovered in 1625 by Father Semedo, long after Nestorianism had  altogether disappeared, leaving not a rack behind.    Manichaeans.--In A.D. 719 an ambassador from Tokharestan arrived at  the capital. He was accompanied by one Ta-mou-she, who is said to have  taught the religion of the Chaldean Mani, or Manes, who died about A.D.  274. In 807 the Manichaean sect made formal application to be allowed  to have recognised places of meeting; shortly after which they too  disappear from history.    Judaism.--The Jews, known to the Chinese as those who \"take out the  sinew,\" from their peculiar method of preparing meat, are said by some  to have reached China, and to have founded a colony in Honan,  shortly after the Captivity, carrying the Pentateuch with them. Three  inscriptions on stone tablets are still extant, dated 1489, 1512, and  1663, respectively. The first says the Jews came to China during the  Sung dynasty; the second, during the Han dynasty; and the third, during  the Chou dynasty. The first is probably the correct account. We know  that the Jews built a synagogue at K'ai-feng Fu in A.D. 1164, where they  were discovered by Ricci in the seventeenth century, and where, in 1850,  there were still to be found traces of the old faith, now said to be  completely effaced.    Christianity.--With the advent of the Jesuit Fathers in the sixteenth  century, and of the Protestant missionaries, Marshman and Morrison, in  1799 and 1807 respectively, we pass gradually down to the present day,  where we may well pause and look around to see what remains to the  modern Chinese of their ancient faiths. It is scarcely too much to  say that all idea of the early God of their forefathers has long since  ceased to vivify their religious instincts, though the sacrifices to  God and to Earth are still annually performed by the Emperor.  Ancestor-worship, and the cult of Confucius, are probably very much  what they were many hundreds of years ago; while Taoism, once a pure  philosophy, is now a corrupt religion. As to alien faiths, the Buddhism  of China would certainly not be recognised by the Founder of Buddhism  in India; Mahometanism is fairly flourishing; Christianity is still  bitterly opposed.

As  both lines fall within less than a division, we subdivide that division  as by arcs _a_, _b_, which divide it into three equal divisions, of  which the lines occupy one division. Hence, it is clear that they are at  an angle of 20 degrees, because twenty is one-third of sixty. When the  number of degrees of angle between two lines is less than 90, the lines  are said to form an acute angle one to the other, but when they are at  more than 90 degrees of angle they are said to form an obtuse angle.  Thus, in Figure 60, A and C are at an acute angle, while B and C are at  an obtuse angle. F and G form an acute angle one to the other, as also  do G and B, while H and A are at an obtuse angle. Between I and J there  are 90 degrees of angle; hence they form neither an acute nor an obtuse  angle, but what is termed a right-angle, or an angle of 90 degrees. E  and B are at an obtuse angle. Thus it will be perceived that it is the  amount of inclination of one line to another that determines its angle,  irrespective of the positions of the lines, with respect to the circle.    [Illustration: Fig. 60.]      TRIANGLES.    A right-angled triangle is one in which two of the sides are at a right  angle one to the other. Figure 61 represents a right-angled triangle, A  and B forming a right angle. The side opposite, as C, is called the  hypothenuse. The other sides, A and B, are called respectively the base  and the perpendicular.    [Illustration: Fig. 61.]    [Illustration: Fig. 62.]    [Illustration: Fig. 63.]    [Illustration: Fig. 64.]    An acute-angled triangle has all its angles acute, as in Figure 63.    An obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle, as A, Figure 62.    When all the sides of a triangle are equal in length and the angles are  all equal, as in Figure 63, it is termed an equilateral triangle, and  either of its sides may be called the base. When two only of the sides  and two only of the angles are equal, as in Figure 64, it is termed an  isosceles triangle, and the side that is unequal, as A in the figure, is  termed the base.    [Illustration: Fig. 65.]    [Illustration: Fig. 66.]    When all the sides and angles are unequal, as in Figure 65, it is termed  a scalene triangle, and either of its sides may be called the base.    The angle opposite the base of a triangle is called the vertex.    [Illustration: Fig. 67.]    [Illustration: Fig. 68.]    A figure that is bounded by four straight lines is termed a quadrangle,  quadrilateral or tetragon. When opposite sides of the figure are  parallel to each other it is termed a parallelogram, no matter what the  angle of the adjoining lines in the figure may be. When all the angles  are right angles, as in Figure 66, the figure is called a rectangle. If  the sides of a rectangle are of equal length, as in Figure 67, the  figure is called a square. If two of the parallel sides of a rectangle  are longer than the other two sides, as in Figure 66, it is called an  oblong. If the length of the sides of a parallelogram are all equal and  the angles are not right angles, as in Figure 68, it is called a rhomb,  rhombus or diamond. If two of the parallel sides of a parallelogram are  longer than the other two, and the angles are not right angles, as in  Figure 69, it is called a rhomboid. If two of the parallel sides of a  quadrilateral are of unequal lengths and the angles of the other two  sides are not equal, as in Figure 70, it is termed a trapezoid.    [Illustration: Fig. 69.]    [Illustration: Fig. 70.]    [Illustration: Fig. 71.]    If none of the sides of a quadrangle are parallel, as in Figure 71, it  is termed a trapezium.    THE CONSTRUCTION OF POLYGONS.    [Illustration: Fig. 71_a_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 72.]    The term polygon is applied to figures having flat sides equidistant  from a common centre. From this centre a circle may be struck that will  touch all the corners of the sides of the polygon, or the point of each  side that is central in the length of the side. In drawing a polygon,  one of these circles is used upon which to divide the figure into the  requisite number of divisions for the sides. When the dimension of the  polygon across its corners is given, the circle drawn to that dimension  circumscribes the polygon, because the circle is without or outside of  the polygon and touches it at its corners only. When the dimension  across the flats of the polygon is given, or when the dimension given is  that of a circle that can be inscribed or marked within the polygon,  touching its sides but not passing through them, then the polygon  circumscribes or envelops the circle, and the circle is inscribed or  marked within the polygon. Thus, in Figure 71 _a_, the circle is  inscribed within the polygon, while in Figure 72 the polygon is  circumscribed by the circle; the first is therefore a circumscribed and  the second an inscribed polygon. A regular polygon is one the sides of  which are all of an equal length.      NAMES OF REGULAR POLYGONS.    A figure of 3 sides is called a Trigon.       \"      4   \"        \"      Tetragon.    polygon   5   \"        \"      Pentagon.       \"      6   \"        \"      Hexagon.       \"      7   \"        \"      Heptagon.       \"      8   \"        \"      Octagon.       \"      9   \"        \"      Enneagon or Nonagon.    [Illustration: Fig. 73.]    [Illustration: Fig. 74.]    The angles of regular polygons are designated by their degrees of angle,  \"at the centre\" and \"at the circumference.\" By the angle at the centre  is meant the angle of a side to a radial line; thus in Figure 73 is a  hexagon, and at C is a radial line; thus the angle of the side D to C is  60 degrees. Or if at the two ends of a side, as A, two radial lines be  drawn, as B, C, then the angles of these two lines, one to the other,  will be the \"angle at the centre.\" The angle at the circumference is the  angle of one side to its next neighbor; thus the angle at the  circumference in a hexagon is 120 degrees, as shown in the figure for  the sides E, F. It is obvious that as all the sides are of equal length,  they are all at the same angle both to the centre and to one another. In  Figure 74 is a trigon, the angles at its centre being 120, and the angle  at the circumference being 60, as marked.

An ellipse is a figure bounded by a continuous curve, whose nature will  be shown presently.    The dimensions of an ellipse are taken at its extreme length and  narrowest width, and they are designated in three ways, as by the length  and breadth, by the major and minor axis (the major axis meaning the  length, and the minor the breadth of the figure), and the conjugate and  transverse diameters, the transverse meaning the shortest, and the  conjugate the longest diameter of the figure.    In this book the terms major and minor axis will be used to designate  the dimensions.    The minor and major axes are at a right angle one to the other, and  their point of intersection is termed the axis of the ellipse.    In an ellipse there are two points situated upon the line representing  the major axis, and which are termed the foci when both are spoken of,  and a focus when one only is referred to, foci simply being the plural  of focus. These foci are equidistant from the centre of the ellipse,  which is formed as follows: Two pins are driven in on the major axis to  represent the foci A and B, Figure 75, and around these pins a loop of  fine twine is passed; a pencil point, C, is then placed in the loop and  pulled outwards, to take up the slack of the twine. The pencil is held  vertical and moved around, tracing an ellipse as shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 75.]    Now it is obvious, from this method of construction, that there will be  at every point in the pencil's path a length of twine from the final  point to each of the foci, and a length from one foci to the other, and  the length of twine in the loop remaining constant, it is demonstrated  that if in a true ellipse we take any number of points in its curve, and  for each point add together its distance to each focus, and to this add  the distance apart of the foci, the total sum obtained will be the same  for each point taken.    [Illustration: Fig. 76.]    [Illustration: Fig. 77.]    In Figures 76 and 77 are a series of ellipses marked with pins and a  piece of twine, as already described. The corresponding ellipses, as A  in both figures, were marked with the same loop, the difference in the  two forms being due to the difference in distance apart of the foci.  Again, the same loop was used for ellipses B in both figures, as also  for C and D. From these figures we perceive that--    1st. With a given width or distance apart of foci, the larger the  dimensions are the nearer the form of the figure will approach to that  of a circle.    2d. The nearer the foci are together in an ellipse, having any given  dimensions, the nearer the form of the figure will approach that of a  circle.    3d. That the proportion of length to width in an ellipse is determined  by the distance apart of the foci.    4th. That the area enclosed within an ellipse of a given circumference  is greater in proportion as the distance apart of the foci is  diminished; and,    5th. That an ellipse may be given any required proportion of width to"]]]
