A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#8)"],[1,"and doubtful harmonies, and she imagines she can  venture the same thing with like effect. But alas! what a travesty the  experiment frequently is!    Many of the New Yorkers who read this page will recall the Original  Dollar Store on Broadway and its fascinating young salesladies. Some of  these were perfect sirens with their loveliness of feature and delicacy  of color; their luxuriant hair, made amenable to the discipline of the  prevailing fashion; the gown stylish and perfect, and frequently not at  all reticent in its revelations of form; the countenance calm, watchful  and intelligent--frequently mischievous; the walk something akin to the  serene consciousness of power which we are told that Phryne exemplified  before her judges, and accompanied with that grace which is the  birthright of beauty in every age and under any circumstances.    For many reasons the tone of morality, in some instances, among store  girls in this city is not high. A variety of obvious causes contribute  to this result, among which may be mentioned their generally poor  salaries: their natural levity, and the example of their companions;  their love of dress and display, coupled with a natural desire for  masculine attentions; long hours in close, impure air; sensational  literature; frequent absence of healthy or adequate home influence; and  the many temptations which beset an attractive girl in such a position.    Many of them enter stores as mere children in the capacity of cash  girls. They are the children of poor parents, and as they grow up to  young maidenhood, they acquire a sort of superficial polish in the  store, and are brightened without being educated. Some grow up and take  their places as full-blown salesladies, and begin to sigh for the gayety  of the streets, for freedom from restraint, and for amusements that are  not within their reach. Naturally _au fait_ in style, with taste and  clever fingers, they dress in an attractive manner, with the hope of  beguiling the ideal hero they have constructed from the pages of the  trashy story paper. It is a sort of voluntary species of sacrifice on  their part--a kind of suicidal decking with flowers, and making  preparation for immolation. Full of pernicious sentimentality, they are  open to the first promising flirtation. They see elegantly-dressed and  diamonded ladies, and their imagination is fed from the fountains of  vulgar literature until they dream that they, too, are destined to be  won by some splendid cavalier of fabulous wealth. Learning from the  wishy-washy literature that their face is their fortune, and so, reading  what happened to others, and how perfectly lovely and romantic it all  was, they are ready for the wiles of the first gay deceiver. Waiting in  vain for their god-like ideal, they are finally content to look a little  lower, and favorably receive the immodest addresses of some clerk in  their own store, or succeed in making a street \"mash.\"    Sometimes the pretty girl rushes impetuously into marriage, repents and  separates from her husband. She is still good looking, and her marital  experience has given her an air of easy assurance, and she readily finds  employment as a saleslady. Her influence afterwards, among girls  comparatively innocent and without her experience, cannot but be  pernicious, and at the same time must exert a certain formative and  shaping process in determing the peculiar character of the whole class  of girls in the store.    Very frequently she does not attain even to the questionable dignity of  a marriage ceremony. Flattered by the attentions of some swell, the  pretty shop girl will be induced to accompany him to the theatre and to  supper in a concert saloon. Her vanity is kindled by his appearance. She  rejoices in the style of his clothes, in the magnificence of his  jewelry, and she thinks her mission in life is to walk beside the  splendid swell, amid rose gardens, theatres and supper rooms, for the  remainder of her life. Finally she yields to his soft solicitations, and  her prospects are forever blighted. She becomes an incorrigible flirt,  meets her \"fellows\" on the corner of the street near the store, spends a  certain number of evenings and nights with them at hotels where no  course of catechism takes place at the clerk's desk. She goes to Coney  Island or local beer gardens on Sundays, manifesting a vivid animal  pleasure in her enjoyment, with little manifestation of gratitude  towards her escort who is supplying the money.    Sometimes, again, an exceptionally pretty girl will fall a victim to the  proprietor, the manager or some of the superintendents of the store; and  there have been cases of this kind heard in the courts, in one of which  the proprietor not only seduced the girl, but married her, afterwards  obtaining a divorce because of her incontinence. Sometimes the lapse of  these girls from the paths of virtue is accompanied with exceptional  hardships. The young lady is beautiful as well as good perhaps, and the  pride of her idolizing parents, who have taught her that she is fit to  be the wife of a duke. She attracts the eye of a man about town, and the  process of courting and flattery--of sapping and mining--begins, with  the result that he has had in view since the inception of the  acquaintance. He is not a bad fellow as the world goes; but providence  and society have made it very hard for single men to show kindness to  single women in any way but one. He is sorry at her situation; but she  is hardly the person for him to marry, even with her blooming,  flower-like face. In such a situation--and such situations are far too  common with the class--Byron's lines, slightly altered, seem peculiarly  applicable to the pretty shop girl:      \"'Twas thine own beauty gave the fatal blow,  And help'd to plant the wound that laid thee low.\"      Sometimes it happens that the pretty girl, wearied of waiting for her  knightly deliverer, comes across the advertisement of a gifted  seeress--the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, perchance, or \"the  only English prophetess who has the genuine Roman and Arabian talismans  for love, good luck, and all business affairs;\" or the wonderful  clairvoyant who can be \"consulted on absent friends, love, courtship and  marriage.\" Not infrequently she falls into the toils of those  advertising frauds, who frequently combine the vile trade of procuress  with the ostensible trade of fortune-telling. When the girl is drawn to  this den, the trump card offered her is, of course, the young gentleman,  rich as Croesus and handsome as Adonis, with whom she is to fall in  love. He is generally described with considerable minuteness, and the  time and place of meeting foretold. This may be fictitious, and it is  fortunate for her if it is so. Rut the seeress too frequently needs no  powers of clairvoyance or ratiocination to make these disclosures, for  some _roue_; who has exhausted the ordinary rounds of dissipation, or  some fast young fellow seeking a change, has made a bargain with the  prophetess for a new and innocent victim--the amount of the fee to  depend on the means and liberality of the libertine and the  attractiveness of the victim. The vain, silly girl is dazzled with the  wily woman's story, and readily promises to call again. At her next  visit the man inspects her from some place of concealment, and if she  meets his views, either an introduction takes place or a rendezvous is  perfected. Thus the acquaintance begins, with the result which every  intelligent reader can see for himself. Sometimes the picture of the  scamp is shown, but in every case there is but one end in view on the  part of the seeress, and that end is almost invariably achieved. The  girl thus becomes clandestinely \"gay,\" and spreads the influence of her  evil example and impure associations among her shopmates. Pope has told  us in four immortal lines the effects of a constant contact with vice.  In the second epistle of his Essay on Man, he writes:      \"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,  As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;  Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,  We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"      In the case of the class of young girls under consideration this truth  is peculiarly applicable. In consequence of their associations they hear  and see things whose influence is almost wholly bad and pernicious.  Those disguised advertisements in the newspapers called \"Personals\" are  of this evil character. To young girls, with minds imperfectly  disciplined, there is a fatal fascination in the mystery of  surreptitious appointments and meetings. Mystery is so suggestive and  romantic, and the young girl who, from piqued curiosity, is tempted to  dally with a \"Matrimonial\" or a \"Personal,\" is an object of  commiseration. From dallying and reading and wondering, the step is easy  to answer such notices. She believes that she has a chance of getting a  rich and handsome husband, who will take her to Europe, and, in other  respects, make her life a sort of earthly paradise. The men who write  such advertisements know this besetting female weakness and bait their  trap accordingly. And so a young girl, too frequently, walks alone and  unadvised into the meshes of an acquaintanceship which leads to her  ruin. It is perhaps as useless to ask the men who are base enough to  conceive these things to refrain from publishing them, as it is to urge  the mercenary proprietors of certain newspapers to refrain from printing  them in their columns. Yet it must be perfectly clear to all  right-thinking minds, that it is in vain for parents to warn, parsons to  preach, friends to advise, for the good to deplore, and the ignorant to  wonder, at the increasing deterioration of our metropolitan morals,  while these tempting lures to feminine destruction are so alluringly  displayed.    It would be doing very imperfect justice to this theme did we "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#8)"],[1,"from the eleventh century. Before that time there had been  transparent mosaics made by putting together bits of colored glass, and  arranging them in simple, set and ornamental patterns. Such mosaics date  from the earliest days of Christianity, and were in use as soon as glass  was used for windows. From ancient writings we know that some windows were  made with pictures upon them as long ago as A.D. 989; but nothing now  remains from that remote date.    There is a doubt as to whether glass-painting originated in France or  Germany. Some French authors ascribe its invention to Germany, while some  German writers accord the same honor to France. Remains of glass-painting  of the eleventh century have been found in both these countries; but it is  probable that five windows in the Cathedral of Augsburg date from 1065,  and are a little older than any others of which we know. This picture of  David is from one of them, and is probably as old as any painted window in  existence.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--WINDOW. _From the Cathedral of St. Denis._]    The oldest glass-painting in France is probably a single fragment in the  Cathedral of Le Mans. This cathedral was completed in 1093, but was badly  burned in 1136, so that but a single piece of its windows remains; this  has been inserted in a new window in the choir, and is thus preserved.  With the beginning of the twelfth century, glass-painting became more  frequent in Europe, and near the end of this century it was introduced  into England, together with the Gothic style of architecture. Very soon a  highly decorative effect was given to glass-painting, and the designs upon  many windows were very much like those used in the miniatures of the same  time. The stained glass in the Cathedral of St. Denis, near Paris, is very  important. It dates from about 1140-1151, and was executed under the care  of the famous Abbot Suger. He employed both French and German workmen, and  decorated the entire length of the walls with painted windows. St. Denis  was the first French cathedral in the full Gothic style of architecture.  The present windows in St. Denis can scarcely be said to be the original  ones, as the cathedral has suffered much from revolutions; but some of  them have been restored as nearly as possible, and our illustration (Fig.  22) will give you a good idea of what its windows were.    The stripes which run across the ground in this window are red and blue,  and the leaf border is in a light tone of color. There are nine  medallions; the three upper ones have simply ornamental designs upon them,  and the six lower ones have pictures of sacred subjects. The one given  here is an Annunciation, in which the Abbot Suger kneels at the feet of  the Virgin Mary. His figure interferes with the border of the medallion in  a very unusual manner.    Perhaps the most important ancient glass-painting remaining in France is  that of the west front of the Cathedral of Chartres. It dates from about  1125, when this front was begun; there are three windows, and their color  is far superior to the glass of a later period, which is in the same  cathedral. The earliest painted glass in England dates from about 1180.  Some of the windows in Canterbury Cathedral correspond to those in the  Cathedral of St. Denis.    In the Strasbourg Cathedral there are some splendid remains of painted  glass of the Romanesque period, although they were much injured by the  bombardment of 1870. Fig. 23 is from one of the west windows, and  represents King Henry I.    This is an unusually fine example of the style of the period before the  more elaborate Gothic manner had arisen; the quiet regularity of the  drapery and the dignified air of the whole figure is very impressive.    An entirely different sort of colored windows was used in the churches and  edifices which belonged to the Cistercian order of monks. The rule of this  order was severe, and while they wished to soften the light within their  churches, they believed it to be wrong to use anything which denoted pomp  or splendor in the decoration of the house of God. For these reasons they  invented what is called the _grisaille_ glass: it is painted in regular  patterns in gray tones of color. Sometimes these windows are varied by a  leaf pattern in shades of green and brown, with occasional touches of  bright color; but this is used very sparingly. Some of these _grisaille_  windows are seen in France; but the finest are in Germany in the Cathedral  of Heiligenkreuz: they date from the first half of the thirteenth century.      THE FINAL, OR GOTHIC PERIOD.    The Gothic order of architecture, which was perfected during this period,  had a decided influence upon the painting and sculpture of the time; but  this influence was not felt until Gothic architecture had reached a high  point in its development. France was now the leading country of the world,  and Paris came to be the most important of all cities: it was the centre  from which went forth edicts as to the customs of society, the laws of  dress and conduct, and even of the art of love. From France came the codes  of chivalry, and the crusades, which spread to other lands, originated  there. Thus, for the time, Paris overshadowed Rome and the older centres  of art, industry, and science, with a world-wide influence.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--FIGURE OF HENRY I. IN WEST WINDOW OF STRASBOURG  CATHEDRAL.]    Although the painting of this period had largely the same characteristics  as that of the Romanesque period, it had a different spirit, and it was no  longer under the control of the clergy. Before this time, too, painters  had frequently been skilled in other arts; now it became the custom for  them to be painters only, and besides this they were divided into certain  classes of painters, and were then associated with other craftsmen who  were engaged in the trade which was connected with their art. That is, the  glass-painters painted glass only, and were associated with the  glass-blowers; those who decorated shields, with the shield or scutcheon  makers, and so on; while the painters, pure and simple, worked at  wall-painting, and a little later at panel-painting also. From this  association of artists and tradesmen there grew up brotherhoods which  supported their members in all difficulties, and stood by each other like  friends. Each brotherhood had its altar in some church; they had their  funerals and festivals in common, and from these brotherhoods grew up the  more powerful societies which were called guilds. These guilds became  powerful organizations; they had definite rights and duties, and even  judicial authority as to such matters as belonged to their special trades.    All this led to much greater individuality among artists than had ever  existed before: it came to be understood that a painter could, and had a  right to, paint a picture as he wished, and was not governed by any  priestly law. Religious subjects were still painted more frequently than  others, and the decoration of religious edifices was the chief employment  of the artists; but they worked with more independence of thought and  spirit. The painters studied more from nature, and though the change was  very slow, it is still true that a certain softness of effect, an easy  flow of drapery, and a new grace of pose did appear, and about A.D. 1350 a  new idea of the uses and aims of painting influenced artists everywhere.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--BIRTH OF THE VIRGIN. _From the Grandes Heures of  the Duc de Berri._]    About that time they attempted to represent distances, and to create  different planes in their works; to reproduce such things as they  represented far more exactly than they had done before, and to put them in  just relations to surrounding places and objects; in a word, they seemed  to awake to an appreciation of the true office of painting and to its  infinite possibilities.    During this Gothic period some of the most exquisite manuscripts were made  in France and Germany, and they are now the choicest treasures of their  kind in various European collections.    Fig. 24, of the birth of the Virgin Mary, is from one of the most splendid  books of the time which was painted for the Duke de Berry and called the  Great Book of the Hours. The wealth of ornament in the border is a  characteristic of the French miniatures of the time. The Germans used a  simpler style, as you will see by Fig. 25, of the Annunciation.    The influence of the Gothic order of architecture upon glass-painting was  very pronounced. Under this order the windows became much more important  than they had been, and it was not unusual to see a series of windows  painted in such pictures as illustrated the whole teaching of the  doctrines of the church. It was at this time that the custom arose of  donating memorial windows to religious edifices. Sometimes they were the  gift of a person or a family, and the portraits of the donors were painted  in the lower part of the window, and usually in a kneeling posture; at  other times windows were given by guilds, and it is very odd to see  craftsmen of various sorts at work in a cathedral window: such pictures  exist at Chartres, Bourges, Amiens, and other places.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--THE ANNUNCIATION. _From the Mariale of Archbishop  Arnestus of Prague._]    About A.D. 1300 it began to be the custom to represent architectural  effects upon colored windows. Our cut is from a window at Konigsfelden,  and will show exactly what I mean (Fig. 26).    This style of decoration was not as effective as the earlier ones had  been, and, indeed, from about this time glass-painting became less  satisfactory than before, from the fact that it had more resemblance to  panel-painting, and so lost a part of the individuality which had belonged  to it.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--PAINTED WINDOW AT KONIGSFELDEN.]    Wall-paintings were rare in the Gothic period, for "]]]
