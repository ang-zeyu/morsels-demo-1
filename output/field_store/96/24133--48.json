Internet hosts    This entry lists the number of Internet hosts available within a  country. An Internet host is a computer connected directly to the  Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) computer is a  host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired terminal, at an  institution with a mainframe computer connected directly to the  Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via telephone line,  cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's host computer.  The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of Internet  connectivity.    Internet users    This entry gives the number of users within a country that access the  Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and may include users  who access the Internet at least several times a week to those who  access it only once within a period of several months.    Introduction    This category includes one entry, Background.    Investment (gross fixed)    This entry records total business spending on fixed assets, such as  factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings, and inventories of raw  materials, which provide the basis for future production. It is  measured gross of the depreciation of the assets, i.e., it includes  invesment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped capital.    Irrigated land    This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is  artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch    This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) and a brief  description of the selection process for members.    Labor force    This entry contains the total labor force figure.    Labor force - by occupation    This entry lists the percentage distribution of the labor force by  occupation. The distribution will total less than 100 percent if the  data are incomplete.    Land boundaries    This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the  individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries. When  available, official lengths published by national statistical agencies  are used. Because surveying methods may differ, country border lengths  reported by contiguous countries may differ.    Land use    This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three  different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated for crops  like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest;  permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and  rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes land under  flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land  under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land not arable or  under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and pastures, forests  and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land, etc.    Languages    This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting with the  largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking  that language.    Legal system    This entry contains a brief description of the legal system's  historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of International  Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.    Legislative branch    This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral,  bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of  office. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.  Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats  held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth    This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group  of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains  constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as  the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a  measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the  mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the  potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for  the calculation of various actuarial measures.    Literacy    This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no  universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise  specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the  ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards  that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write  is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy, while not  a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily  available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of  literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development  of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.    Location    This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring  countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Major infectious diseases    This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered in  countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very high  as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases represent  risks to US government personnel traveling to the specified country for  a period of less than three years. The degree of risk is assessed by  considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their  severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases  present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total  disease burden experienced by the local population.    The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific  location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations,  time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine  physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend  appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.    Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown  in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note - The  sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries  may vary according to local conditions.    food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the  local economy:    Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the  liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with  fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit  fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged  symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.    Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the  functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal  contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,  abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.    Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or  water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained  high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.    vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected  arthropod:    Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;  transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;  parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in  cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to  damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;  endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the  majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-  Saharan Africa.    Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe  headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death  in 5% of cases.    Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from  influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;  occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where  most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.    Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral  disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can  progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.    African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma;  transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies;  infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases  when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death;  endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals  act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.    Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania;  transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin  lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases  occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild  and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of  infection.    Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated  with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent  plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America  associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as  fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses  rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a  death rate in excess of 50%.    Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease; infection  may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue;  geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2752"],[0,"Martin Guerre (#8)"],[1,"to be most faithfully described, and  surely only himself could thus narrate his own actions. As the historian  remarks, alluding to the story of Amphitryon, Mercury himself could not  better reproduce all Sosia's actions, gestures, and words, than did the  false Martin Guerre those of the real one.    In accordance with the demand of the accused, Bertrande de Rolls was  detained in seclusion, in order to remove her from the influence of  Pierre Guerre. The latter, however, did not waste time, and during the  month spent in examining the witnesses cited by Martin, his diligent  enemy, guided by some vague traces, departed on a journey, from which he  did not return alone.    All the witnesses bore out the statement of the accused; the latter  heard this in prison, and rejoiced, hoping for a speedy release. Before  long he was again brought before the judge, who told him that his  deposition had been confirmed by all the witnesses examined.    \"Do you know of no others?\" continued the magistrate. \"Have you no  relatives except those you have mentioned?\"    \"I have no others,\" answered the prisoner.    \"Then what do you say to this man?\" said the judge, opening a door.    An old man issued forth, who fell on the prisoner's neck, exclaiming,  \"My nephew!\"    Martin trembled in every limb, but only for a moment. Promptly  recovering himself, and gazing calmly at the newcomer, he asked coolly--    \"And who may you be?\"    \"What!\" said the old man, \"do you not know me? Dare you deny me?--me,  your mother's brother, Carbon Barreau, the old soldier! Me, who dandled  you on my knee in your infancy; me, who taught you later to carry a  musket; me, who met you during the war at an inn in Picardy, when you  fled secretly. Since then I have sought you everywhere; I have spoken of  you, and described your face and person, until a worthy inhabitant of  this country offered to bring me hither, where indeed I did not expect  to find my sister's son imprisoned and fettered as a malefactor. What is  his crime, may it please your honour?\"    \"You shall hear,\" replied the magistrate. \"Then you identify the  prisoner as your nephew? You affirm his name to be---?\"    \"Arnauld du Thill, also called 'Pansette,' after his father, Jacques  Pansa. His mother was Therese Barreau, my sister, and he was born in the  village of Sagias.\"    \"What have you to say?\" demanded the judge, turning to the accused.    \"Three things,\" replied the latter, unabashed, \"this man is either mad,  or he has been suborned to tell lies, or he is simply mistaken.\"    The old man was struck dumb with astonishment. But his supposed nephew's  start of terror had not been lost upon the judge, also much impressed by  the straightforward frankness of Carbon Barreau. He caused fresh  investigations to be made, and other inhabitants of Sagias were summoned  to Rieux, who one and all agreed in identifying the accused as the same  Arnauld du Thill who had been born and had grown up under their very  eyes. Several deposed that as he grew up he had taken to evil courses,  and become an adept in theft and lying, not fearing even to take the  sacred name of God in vain, in order to cover the untruth of his daring  assertions. From such testimony the judge naturally concluded that  Arnauld du Thill was quite capable of carrying on, an imposture, and  that the impudence which he displayed was natural to his character.  Moreover, he noted that the prisoner, who averred that he was born in  Biscay, knew only a few words of the Basque language, and used these  quite wrongly. He heard later another witness who deposed that the  original Martin Guerre was a good wrestler and skilled in the art of  fence, whereas the prisoner, having wished to try what he could do,  showed no skill whatever. Finally, a shoemaker was interrogated, and his  evidence was not the least damning. Martin Guerre, he declared, required  twelve holes to lace his boots, and his surprise had been great when he  found those of the prisoner had only nine. Considering all these points,  and the cumulative evidence, the judge of Rieux set aside the favourable  testimony, which he concluded had been the outcome of general credulity,  imposed on by an extraordinary resemblance. He gave due weight also to  Bertrande's accusation, although she had never confirmed it, and now  maintained an obstinate silence; and he pronounced a judgment by which  Arnauld du Thill was declared \"attainted and convicted of imposture, and  was therefore condemned to be beheaded; after which his body should be  divided into four quarters, and exposed at the four corners of the  town.\"    This sentence, as soon as it was known, caused much diversity of opinion  in the town. The prisoner's enemies praised the wisdom of the judge, and  those less prejudiced condemned his decision; as such conflicting  testimony left room for doubt. Besides, it was thought that the  possession of property and the future of the children required much  consideration, also that the most absolute certainty was demanded before  annulling a past of two whole years, untroubled by any counter claim  whatever.    The condemned man appealed from this sentence to the Parliament of  Toulouse. This court decided that the case required more careful  consideration than had yet been given to it, and began by ordering  Arnauld du Thill to be confronted with Pierre Guerre and Bertrande de  Rolls.    Who can say what feelings animate a man who, already once condemned,  finds himself subjected to a second trial? The torture scarcely ended  begins again, and Hope, though reduced to a shadow, regains her sway  over his imagination, which clings to her skirts, as it were, with  desperation. The exhausting efforts must be recommenced; it is the last  struggle--a struggle which is more desperate in proportion as there is  less strength to maintain it. In this case the defendant was not one of  those who are easily cast down; he collected all his energy, all his  courage, hoping to come victoriously out of the new combat which lay  before him.    The magistrates assembled in the great hall of the Parliament, and the  prisoner appeared before them. He had first to deal with Pierre, and  confronted him calmly, letting him speak, without showing any emotion.  He then replied with indignant reproaches, dwelling on Pierre's greed  and avarice, his vows of vengeance, the means employed to work upon  Bertrande, his secret manoeuvres in order to gain his ends, and the  unheard-of animosity displayed in hunting up accusers, witnesses, and  calumniators. He defied Pierre to prove that he was not Martin Guerre,  his nephew, inasmuch as Pierre had publicly acknowledged and embraced  him, and his tardy suspicions only dated from the time of their violent  quarrel. His language was so strong and vehement, that Pierre became  confused and was unable to answer, and the encounter turned entirely in  Arnauld's favour, who seemed to overawe his adversary from a height of  injured innocence, while the latter appeared as a disconcerted  slanderer.    The scene of his confrontation with Bertrande took a wholly different  character. The poor woman, pale, cast down, worn by sorrow, came  staggering before the tribunal, in an almost fainting condition. She  endeavoured to collect herself, but as soon as she saw the prisoner she  hung her head and covered her face with her hands. He approached her and  besought her in the gentlest accents not to persist in an accusation  which might send him to the scaffold, not thus to avenge any sins he  might have committed against her, although he could not reproach himself  with any really serious fault.    Bertrande started, and murmured in a whisper, \"And Rose?\"    \"Ah!\" Arnauld exclaimed, astonished at this revelation.    His part was instantly taken. Turning to the judges--    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"my wife is a jealous woman! Ten years ago, when I  left her, she had formed these suspicions; they were the cause of my  voluntary exile. To-day she again accuses me of, guilty relations with  the same person; I neither deny nor acknowledge them, but I affirm that  it is the blind passion of jealousy which, aided by my uncle's  suggestions, guided my wife's hand when she signed this denunciation.\"    Bertrande remained silent.    \"Do you dare,\" he continued, turning towards her,--\"do you dare to swear  before God that jealousy did not inspire you with the wish to ruin me?\"    \"And you,\" she replied, \"dare you swear that I was deceived in my  suspicions?\"    \"You see, gentlemen,\" exclaimed the prisoner triumphantly, \"her jealousy  breaks forth before your eyes. Whether I am, or am not, guilty of the  sin she attributes to me, is not the question for you to decide. Can you  conscientiously admit the testimony of a woman who, after publicly  acknowledging me, after receiving me in her house, after living two  years in perfect amity with me, has, in a fit of angry vengeance,  thought she could give the lie to all her wards and actions? Ah!  Bertrande,\" he continued, \"if it only concerned my life I think I could  forgive a madness of which your love is both the cause and the excuse,  but you are a mother, think of that! My punishment will recoil on the  head of my daughter, who is unhappy enough to have been born since our  reunion, and also on our unborn child, which you condemn beforehand to  curse the union which gave it being. Think of this, Bertrande, you will  have to answer before God for what you are now doing!\"    The unhappy woman fell on her knees, weeping.    \"I adjure you,\" he continued solemnly, \"you, my wife, Bertrande de  Rolls, to swear now, here, on the crucifix, that I am an impostor and a  cheat.\"    A crucifix was placed before Bertrande; she made a sign as if to push it  away, endeavoured to speak, and feebly exclaimed, \"No,\" then fell to the  ground, and was carried out insensible.    This scene considerably shook the opinion of the magistrates. They"]]]
