Now the males of some of the migratory species, especially of those  which are accustomed to return to their breeding haunts early in the  season, are called upon to face greater dangers and have a greater  strain imposed upon their strength by starting forth upon their journey  ten days or a fortnight before their prospective mates. The blizzards  which so often sweep across the northern parts of Europe in the latter  half of March, destroying in their course the all too scanty supply of  insect life, may take toll of their numbers; or the westerly gales,  which are not infrequent at that period, may meet them in mid-ocean and  add to the perils of their journey; or the temperature of the previous  weeks may have been sufficiently low to arrest the development of insect  life--and yet males are annually exposed to these risks in hurrying to  their breeding grounds. For what purpose? The answer will largely depend  upon the way in which we regard those few acres wherein a resting place  is ultimately found. For myself, I believe that they are of importance,  inasmuch as the securing of a place suitable for the rearing of  offspring is a primary condition of success in the attainment of  reproduction; and if this be so, it is evident that the interests of  the race will be better served by the males making good this first step  before the females are ready to pair, otherwise they might oscillate  between two modes of behaviour, created by the premature functioning of  conflicting impulses.    The different steps in the process seem to follow one another in ordered  sequence. The male inherits a disposition--which for us, of course, has  prospective meaning--to seek the appropriate breeding ground and there  to establish itself; and as early a functioning of this disposition as  possible, consonant with the conditions of existence in the external  environment, may have been evolved for the following reasons--firstly,  the earlier individuals will meet with less interference wherever they  may settle, every locality will be open to them, every acre free, their  only need being that particular environment for which racial preparation  has fitted them. In the second place, being already established when  other males appear upon the scene, and advertising their presence by  song, they will be less liable to molestation; thirdly, in those cases  in which a long journey is undertaken, they will have ample time to  recover from the fatigue, and, if attacked by later arrivals, will thus  be in a better position to defend their territories; and lastly, a  greater uniformity in their distribution will be insured before the  females begin their search.    There is, besides, another good reason for thinking that the earlier  males will have an advantage. We will assume--and from the abundant  evidence supplied by the marking of birds, it is quite a reasonable  assumption--that there is a tendency, generally speaking, for  individuals to return to the neighbourhood of their birthplace, or to  the place in which they had previously reared their offspring. Now the  earlier arrivals will have no difficulty in securing territories; those  that come later may have to search more diligently, still they will gain  all that they require so long as any available space remains. Then comes  the point when all suitable ground is occupied, and yet there are males  to be provided for. What will be the position of these males? Urged by  their inherited nature, they will leave the district and possibly  continue their search into those adjoining, only, however, to add to the  difficulties of the males there similarly situated; and even allowing  that they are at length successful in establishing themselves, what are  their prospects of securing mates? Since the earlier females will not  extend their wanderings farther than is absolutely necessary, but will  pair whenever the opportunity for doing so arises, it is to the later  females, forced onwards by competition, that the late males must look  for mates; so that when at length pairing does take place, much valuable  time will have been lost.    The disadvantages which the late arrivals have to face are therefore  great, and it is probable that the percentage which attain to  reproduction will on the average be somewhat lower than the percentage  in the case of the earlier arrivals. The district in which my  observations have been made lies well within the limits of the breeding  range of most of our common species, and it is not surprising that I  should have met with little evidence of failure to breed as a result of  failure to secure territory. Some interesting information was supplied  to me, however, by the late Robert Service. He found, in certain seasons  in Dumfriesshire, flocks of from ten to fifty unmated Sedge-Warblers,  which, from the time of their arrival in May until the middle of July,  haunted reed-filled spaces along stagnant streams. These flocks appeared  to him to be composed of loosely-attached individuals of a migrant flock  that had failed to find things congenial enough to entice them to  disperse. But may they not have been composed of males that had failed  to secure territories, or of females that had failed to discover males  in possession of territories, or of both?      We have seen that, in the case of many species, each male establishes  itself in a particular place at the commencement of the breeding season,  even though this may mean a partial or perhaps a complete severance from  former companions. We must now discuss this fact in greater detail  because it is opposed to the views often held regarding the sexual  behaviour of birds, and is manifestly of importance when considering  the theory of breeding territory.    First, however, there is a point which requires some explanation. I  speak of the _same_ male being in the _same_ place. How can I prove its  identity? In the first place it is highly improbable that a bird which  roams about within the same small area of ground, makes regular use of a  certain tree and a certain branch of that tree, and observes a similar  routine day after day, can be other than the same individual. But, apart  from this general consideration, are there any means by which  individuals of the same species can be identified? Well, there is  variation in the plumage. Supposing we take a dozen cock Chaffinches and  examine them carefully, we shall find slight differences in pattern and  in colour--more grey here or a duller red there, as the case may be--and  though these differences may not be sufficient to enable us to pick out  a bird at a distance, they are nevertheless conspicuous when it is close  at hand. Then again there is variation in the song; and the more highly  developed the vocal powers the greater scope there is for variation. But  even the phrases of a simple song can be split up and recombined in  different ways. If one were asked casually whether the different phrases  of the Reed-Bunting's song always followed one another in the same  sequence, the answer would probably be that they certainly did so,  whereas the bird is capable of combining the few notes it possesses in a  surprising number of different ways. And lastly, there are differences  in just the particular way in which specific behaviour, founded upon a  congenital basis, is adapted by each individual to its own special  environment. Racial preparation determines behaviour as a whole, but the  individual is allowed some latitude in the execution of details which  are in themselves of small moment--the selection of a particular tree as  a headquarters and a particular branch upon that tree, the direction of  the distant excursion, and the direction of the limited wanderings  within the small area surrounding the headquarters which in the course  of time determine the extent of the territory, are matters for each  individual to decide when the occasion for doing so arises. Moreover  instances of abnormal coloration or abnormal song are not rare, and they  are valuable since they place the identity of the individual beyond  dispute. I can recall the case of a Willow-Warbler whose song was unlike  that of its own or any other species, and of a Redbreast whose voice  puzzled me not a little. I can recollect also a male Yellow Bunting  whose foot was injured or deformed. Of this bird's behaviour I kept a  record for two months or so; and inasmuch as it inhabited a roadside  hedge, and was of fearless disposition, the deformed foot could plainly  be seen whenever it settled upon the road to search for food.  Identification is not, therefore, a difficulty. There is always some  small difference in colour or in song, or some well-defined routine  which makes recognition possible.    Owing to their great powers of locomotion, birds have generally been  regarded as wanderers more or less; anything in the nature of a fixed  abode, apart from the actual nest, having been accounted foreign to  their mode of life; and even the locality immediately surrounding the  nest has not been apprehended as possessing any meaning for the owner of  that nest. No doubt the supply of food determines their movements for a  considerable part of the year; they seek it where they can find it, here  to-day, there to-morrow--in fact few species fail to move their quarters  at one season or another, so that there is much truth in the notion that  birds are wanderers. Yet to suppose that every individual one sees or"]]]
