[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24562"],[0,"The Panjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir (#8)"],[1," Kashmir the Indus and the  Shyok in some places flow placidly over alluvial flats, and at others  with a rapid and broken current through narrow gorges. At Skardo their  united stream is said, even in winter, to be 500 feet wide and nine or  ten feet deep. If one of the deep gorges, as sometimes happens, is  choked by a landslip, the flood that follows when the barrier finally  bursts may spread devastation hundreds of miles away. To the north of  the fertile Chach plain in Attock there is a wide stretch of land along  the Indus, which still shows in its stony impoverished soil the effects  of the great flood of 1841.    [Illustration: Fig. 12. The Indus at Attock.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13. Indus at Kafirkot, D.I. Khan dt.]    ~The Indus in British India.~--After reaching British India the Indus soon  becomes the boundary dividing Hazara and Peshawar, two districts of the  North West Frontier Province. Lower down it parts Peshawar from the  Panjab district of Attock. In this section after a time the hills recede  on both sides, and the stream is wide and so shallow that it is fordable  in places in the cold weather. There are islands, ferry boats and rafts  can ply, and the only danger is from sudden freshets. Ohind, where  Alexander crossed, is in this section. A more famous passage is at  Attock just below the junction of the Kabul river. Here the heights  again approach the Indus on either bank. The volume of water is vastly  increased by the union of the Kabul river, which brings down the whole  drainage of the southern face of the Hindu Kush. From the north it  receives near Jalalabad the Kunar river, and near Charsadda in Peshawar  the Swat, which with its affluent the Panjkora drains Dir, Bajaur, and  Swat. In the cold weather looking northwards from the Attock fort one  sees the Kabul or Landai as a blue river quietly mingling with the  Indus, and in the angle between them a stretch of white sand. But during  floods the junction is the scene of a wild turmoil of waters. At Attock  there are a railway bridge, a bridge of boats, and a ferry. The bed of  the stream is 2000 feet over sea level. For ninety miles below Attock  the river is confined between bare and broken hills, till it finally  emerges into the plains from the gorge above Kalabagh, where the Salt  Range impinges on the left bank. Between Attock and Kalabagh the right  bank is occupied by Peshawar and Kohat and the left by Attock and  Mianwali. In this section the Indus is joined by the Haro and Soan  torrents, and spanned at Khushalgarh by a railway bridge. This is the  only other masonry bridge crossing it in the Panjab. Elsewhere the  passage has to be made by ferry boats or by boat bridges, which are  taken down in the rainy season. At Kalabagh the height above sea level  is less than 1000 feet. When it passes the western extremity of the Salt  Range the river spreads out into a wide lake-like expanse of waters. It  has now performed quite half of its long journey. Henceforth it receives  no addition from the east till the Panjnad in the south-west corner of  the Muzaffargarh district brings to it the whole tribute of the five  rivers of the Panjab. Here, though the Indian ocean is still 500 miles  distant, the channel is less than 300 feet above the sea. From the west  it receives an important tributary in the Kurram, which, with its  affluent the Tochi, rises in Afghanistan. The torrents from the Suliman  Range are mostly used up for irrigation before they reach the Indus, but  some of them mingle their waters with it in high floods. Below Kalabagh  the Indus is a typical lowland river of great size, with many sandy  islands in the bed and a wide valley subject to its inundations.  Opposite Dera Ismail Khan the valley is seventeen miles across. As a  plains river the Indus runs at first through the Mianwali district of  the Panjab, then divides Mianwali from Dera Ismail Khan, and lastly  parts Muzaffargarh and the Bahawalpur State from the Panjab frontier  district of Dera Ghazi Khan.    ~The Jhelam.~--The Jhelam, the most westernly of the five rivers of the  Panjab, is called the Veth in Kashmir and locally in the Panjab plains  the Vehat. These names correspond to the Bihat of the Muhammadan  historians and the Hydaspes of the Greeks, and all go back to the  Sanskrit Vitasta. Issuing from a deep pool at Vernag to the east of  Islamabad in Kashmir it becomes navigable just below that town, and  flows north-west in a lazy stream for 102 miles through Srinagar, the  summer capital, into the Wular lake, and beyond it to Baramula. The  banks are quite low and often cultivated to the river's edge. But across  the flat valley there is on either side a splendid panorama of  mountains. From Baramula the character of the Jhelam suddenly changes,  and for the next 70 miles to Kohala, where the traveller crosses by a  fine bridge into the Panjab, it rushes down a deep gorge, whose sides  are formed by the Kajnag mountains on the right, and the Pir Panjal on  the left, bank. Between Baramula and Kohala there is a drop from 5000 to  2000 feet. At Domel, the stage before Kohala the Jhelam receives from  the north the waters of the Kishnganga, and lower down it is joined by  the Kunhar, which drains the Kagan glen in Hazara. A little above Kohala  it turns sharply to the south, continuing its character as a mountain  stream hemmed in by the hills of Rawalpindi on the right bank and of the  Punch State on the left. The hills gradually sink lower and lower, but  on the left side only disappear a little above the cantonment of Jhelam,  where there is a noble railway bridge. From Jhelam onwards the river is  of the usual plains' type. After dividing the districts of Jhelam (right  bank) and Gujrat (left), it flows through the Shahpur and Jhang  districts, falling finally into the Chenab at Trimmu, 450 miles from its  source. There is a second railway bridge at Haranpur on the Sind Sagar  line, and a bridge of boats at Khushab, in the Shahpur district. The  noblest and most-varied scenery in the north-west Himalaya is in the  catchment area of the Jhelam. The Kashmir valley and the valleys which  drain into the Jhelam from the north, the Liddar, the Lolab, the Sind,  and the Kagan glen, display a wealth of beauty unequalled elsewhere. Nor  does this river wholly lose its association with beauty in the plains.  Its very rich silt gives the lands on its banks the green charm of rich  crops and pleasant trees.    ~The Chenab.~--The Chenab (more properly Chinab or river of China) is the  Asikni of the Vedas and the Akesines of the Greek historians. It is  formed by the union of the Chandra and Bhaga, both of which rise in  Lahul near the Baralacha pass. Having become the Chandrabhaga the river  flows through Pangi in Chamba and the south-east of Kashmir. Near  Kishtwar it breaks through the Pir Panjal range, and thenceforwards  receives the drainage of its southern slopes. At Akhnur it becomes  navigable and soon after it enters the Panjab district of Sialkot. A  little later it is joined from the west by the Tawi, the stream above  which stands Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir. The Chenab parts  Sialkot and Gujranwala on the left bank from Gujrat and Shahpur on the  right. At Wazirabad, near the point where Sialkot, Gujrat, and  Gujranwala meet, it is crossed by the Alexandra railway bridge. Leaving  Shahpur and Gujranwala behind, the Chenab flows through Jhang to its  junction with the Jhelam at Trimmu. In this section there is a second  railway bridge at Chund Bharwana. The united stream runs on under the  name of Chenab to be joined on the north border of the Multan district  by the Ravi and on its southern border by the Sutlej. Below its junction  with the latter the stream is known as the Panjnad. In the plains the  Chenab cannot be called an attractive river, and its silt is far  inferior to that of the Jhelam.    [Illustration: Fig. 14. Fording the River at Lahore.]    ~The Ravi.~--The Ravi was known to the writers of the Vedic hymns as the  Parushni, but is called in classical Sanskrit Iravati, whence the  Hydraotes of the Greek historians. It rises near the Rotang pass in  Kangra, and flows north-west through the southern part of Chamba. Below  the town of Chamba, it runs as a swift slaty-blue mountain stream, and  here it is spanned by a fine bridge. Passing on to the north of the hill  station of Dalhousie it reaches the Kashmir border, and turning to the  south-west flows along it to Basoli where Kashmir, Chamba, and the  British district of Gurdaspur meet. At this point it is 2000 feet above  the sea level. It now forms the boundary of Kashmir and Gurdaspur, and  finally near Madhopur, where the head-works of the Bari Doab canal are  situated, it passes into the Gurdaspur district. Shortly after it is  joined from the north by a large torrent called the Ujh, which rises in  the Jammu hills. After reaching the Sialkot border the Ravi parts that  district first from Gurdaspur and then from Amritsar, and, passing  through the west of Lahore, divides Montgomery and Lyallpur, and flowing  through the north of Multan joins the Chenab near the Jhang border. In  Multan there is a remarkable straight reach in the channel known as the  Sidhnai, which has been utilized for the site of the head-works of a  small canal. The Degh, a torrent which rises in the Jammu hills and has  a long course through the Sialkot and Gujranwala districts, joins the  Ravi when in flood in the north of the Lyallpur district. But its waters  will now be diverted into the river higher up in order to safeguard the  Upper Chenab canal. Lahore is on the left bank of the Ravi. It is a mile  from the cold weather channel, but in high floods the waters have often  come almost up to the Fort. At Lahore the North Western Railway and the  Grand Trunk Road are carried over the Ravi by masonry bridges. There is  a second railway bridge over the Sidhnai reach in Multan. Though the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#8)"],[1,"been well described by the Rev. W. Dunbar, a  Scotch Apiarian.    \"When the queen is about to lay, she puts her head into a cell, and  remains in that position for a second or two, to ascertain its fitness  for the deposit which she is about to make. She then withdraws her  head, and curving her body downwards,[2] inserts the lower part of it  into the cell: in a few seconds she turns half round upon herself and  withdraws, leaving an egg behind her. When she lays a considerable  number, she does it equally on each side of the comb, those on the one  side being as exactly opposite to those on the other as the relative  position of the cells will admit. The effect of this is to produce the  utmost possible concentration and economy of heat for developing the  various changes of the brood!\"    Here as at every step in the economy of the bee our minds are filled  with admiration as we witness the perfect adaptation of means to ends.  Who can blame the warmest enthusiasm of the Apiarian in view of a  sagacity which seems scarcely inferior to that of man.    \"The eggs of bees,\" I quote from the admirable treatise of Bevan, \"are  of a lengthened oval shape, with a slight curvature, and of a bluish  white color: being besmeared at the time of laying, with a glutinous  substance,[3] they adhere to the bases of the cells, and remain  unchanged in figure or situation for three or four days; they are then  hatched, the bottom of each cell presenting to view a small white worm.  On its growing so as to touch the opposite angle of the cell, it coils  itself up, to use the language of Swammerdam, like a dog when going to  sleep; and floats in a whitish transparent fluid, which is deposited in  the cells by the nursing-bees, and by which it is probably nourished; it  becomes gradually enlarged in its dimensions, till the two extremities  touch one another and form a ring. In this state it is called a larva or  worm. So nicely do the bees calculate the quantity of food which will be  required, that none remains in the cell when it is transformed to a  nymph. It is the opinion of many eminent naturalists that farina does  not constitute the sole food of the larva, but that it consists of a  mixture of farina, honey and water, partly digested in the stomachs of  the nursing-bees.\"    \"The larva having derived its support, in the manner above described,  for four, five or six days, according to the season,\" (the development  being retarded in cool weather, and badly protected hives,) \"continues  to increase during that period, till it occupies the whole breadth and  nearly the length of the cell. The nursing bees now seal over the cell,  with a light _brown cover_, externally more or less _convex_, (the cap  of a drone cell is more convex than that of a worker,) and thus  differing from that of a honey cell which is _paler_ and somewhat  _concave_.\" The cap of the brood cell appears to be made of a mixture of  bee-bread and wax; it is not air tight as it would be if made of wax  alone; but when examined with a microscope it appears to be reticulated,  or full of fine holes through which the enclosed insect can have air for  all necessary purposes. From its texture and shape it is easily thrust  off by the bee when mature, whereas, if it consisted wholly of wax, the  young bee would either perish for lack of air, or be unable to force its  way into the world! Both the material and shape of the lids which seal  up the honey cells are different, because an entirely different object  was aimed at; they are of pure wax to make them air tight and thus to  prevent the honey from souring or candying in the cells! They are  concave or hollowed inwards to give them greater strength to resist the  pressure of their contents!    To return to Bevan. \"The larva is no sooner perfectly inclosed than it  begins to line the cell by spinning round itself, after the manner of  the silk worm, a whitish silky film or cocoon, by which it is encased,  as it were, in a pod. When it has undergone this change, it has usually  borne the name of _nymph_ or _pupa_. The insect has now attained its  full growth, and the large amount of nutriment which it has taken serves  as a store for developing the perfect insect.\"    \"The _working bee nymph_ spins its cocoon in thirty-six hours. After  passing about three days in this state of preparation for a new  existence, it gradually undergoes so great a change as not to wear a  vestige of its previous form, but becomes armed with a firmer mail, and  with scales of a dark brown hue. On its belly six rings become  distinguishable, which by slipping one over another enables the bee to  shorten its body whenever it has occasion to do so.    \"When it has reached the twenty-first day of its existence, counting  from the moment the egg is laid, it comes forth a perfect winged insect.  The cocoon is left behind, and forms a closely attached and exact lining  to the cell in which it was spun; by this means the breeding cells  become smaller and their partitions stronger, the oftener they change  their tenants; and may become so much diminished in size as not to admit  of the perfect development of full sized bees.\"    \"Such are the respective stages of the working bee: those of the royal  bee are as follows: she passes three days in the egg and is five a worm;  the workers then close her cell, and she immediately begins spinning her  cocoon, which occupies her twenty four hours. On the tenth and eleventh  days and a part of the twelfth, as if exhausted by her labor, she  remains in complete repose. Then she passes four days and a part of the  fifth as a nymph. It is on the sixteenth day therefore that the perfect  state of queen is attained.\"    \"The drone passes three days in the egg, six and a half as a worm, and  changes into a perfect insect on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth day  after the egg is laid.\"    \"The _development_ of _each species_ likewise proceeds more slowly when  the colonies are weak or the air cool, and when the weather is very cold  it is entirely suspended. Dr. Hunter has observed that the eggs, worms  and nymphs all require a heat above 70 deg. of Fahrenheit for their  evolution.\"    In the chapter on protection against extremes of _heat_ and _cold_, I  have dwelt, at some length, upon the importance of constructing the  hives in such a manner as to enable the bees to preserve, as far as  possible, a uniform temperature in their tenement. In thin hives exposed  to the sun, the heat is sometimes so great as to destroy the eggs and  the larvae, even when the combs escape from being melted; and the cold is  often so severe as to check the development of the brood, and sometimes  to kill it outright.    In such hives, when the temperature out of doors falls suddenly and  severely, the bees at once feel the unfavorable change; they are obliged  in self defence to huddle together to keep warm, and thus large portions  of the brood comb are often abandoned, and the brood either destroyed at  once by the cold, or so enfeebled that they never recover from the  shock. Let every bee keeper, in all his operations, remember that brood  comb must never be exposed to a low temperature so as to become chilled:  the disastrous effects are almost as certain, as when the eggs of a  setting hen are left, for too long a time, by the careless mother. The  brood combs are never safe when taken for any considerable time from the  bees, unless the temperature is fully up to summer heat.    \"[4]The young bees break their envelope with their teeth, and assisted,  as soon as they come forth, by the older ones, proceed to cleanse  themselves from the moisture and exuviae with which they were surrounded.  Both drones and workers on emerging from the cell are, at first grey,  soft and comparatively helpless so that some time elapses before they  take wing.    \"With respect to the cocoons spun by the different larvae, both workers  and drones spin _complete cocoons_, or inclose themselves on every side;  royal larvae construct only _imperfect cocoons_, open behind, and  enveloping only the head, thorax, and first ring of the abdomen; and  Huber concludes, without any hesitation, that the final cause of their  forming only incomplete cocoons is, that they may thus be exposed to the  mortal sting of the first hatched queen, whose instinct leads her  instantly to seek the destruction of those who would soon become her  rivals.    \"If the royal larvae spun complete cocoons, the stings of the queens  seeking to destroy their rivals might be so entangled in their meshes  that they could not be disengaged. 'Such,' says Huber, 'is the  instinctive enmity of young queens to each other, that I have seen one  of them, immediately on its emergence from the cell, rush to those of  its sisters, and tear to pieces even the imperfect larvae. Hitherto  philosophers have claimed our admiration of nature for her care in  preserving and multiplying the species. But from these facts we must now  admire her precautions in exposing certain individuals to a mortal  hazard.'\"    The cocoon of the royal larva is very much stronger and coarser than  that spun by the drone or worker, its texture considerably resembling  that of the silk worm's. The young queen does not come forth from her  cell until she is quite mature; and as its great size gives her abundant  room to exercise her wings she is capable of flying as soon as she quits  it. While still in her cell she makes the fluttering and piping noises  with which every observant bee keeper is so well acquainted.    Some Apiarians have supposed that the queen bee has the power to  regulate the development of eggs in her ovaries, so that few or many are  produced, according to the necessities of the colony. This is evidently  a mistake. Her eggs, like those of the domestic hen, are formed without  any volition of her own, and when fully developed, must be extruded.
