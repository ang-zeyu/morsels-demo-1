But it has lost much for want of  investigation. Our free school and Sunday-school systems are making the  rising generation better acquainted with both science and the Bible, and a  thorough acquaintance with both is the one thing most needed in order to a  better future in religion, as well as in every other human interest. The  time is come when men will no longer be content to listen to grave errors  and keep silence. Every truth is being put to the test of logic, as well  as fact. It is natural to abhor a contradiction, and it is right. All  truth is harmonious. I am glad that harmony is demanded in religious  teaching; I often think of pulpit teaching away back thirty and forty  years ago. It used to be very popular in some parts to tell people that  they could do nothing to better their condition in a future state, and, at  the same time, exhort them to do better.    I heard of three brothers, George, William and James. George and William  were \"Hard-shell Baptist\" preachers; James made no profession. His wife  was a member of George's congregation. She was a great \"scold.\" One day  James failed to do just as she wished him, and, as a matter of course, he  received quite a lecture; finally the woman told him that it was a great  pity that he could not be a good man, like his brother George or brother  William, and fell to exhorting him to do better. He finally became  impatient and said, \"Yes! George and William were too lazy to work, and I  called them to preach. They both stood it until the third call, and then  put on their hats and went. You belong to George's church, and I go there  with you to hear him preach. He tells me that I can do nothing, and you  tell me that I can do nothing; and, now, what in the h--l do you want me to  do?\" Such inconsistent teaching was always repugnant to common sense and  natural reason. There are many persons yet teaching the old falsehood that  man is passive in his conversion, notwithstanding the fact that men are  imperatively commanded to convert--turn, that their sins may be blotted  out. Men are yet found in some Protestant pulpits who spend a great deal  of their time praying the Lord to convert sinners. It is often the case,  in their own estimation, that the Lord gives no heed to their prayers; but  this has happened so frequently that it does not seem to trouble them. It  has been a very short time since I heard a minister advocating what he was  pleased to call \"miraculous conversion.\" I thought, if you are right in  that matter, why did the Heavenly Father command his love, commended in  the Savior's death, preached to every creature, and still refuse to  convert every creature? What difference does it make to me whether the  Lord passed me by before He made Adam, or passed me by on yesterday? And  if He refuses to send His spirit and convert me until the last, and I die  in my sins and am lost, who is to blame? What is the difference between  His neglect to convert me and the old Calvinistic idea that Christ did not  die for me? What is the difference between the spirit of God being partial  to communities--going into one and converting a great many persons and  passing others by--and God Himself being partial? And why does the Spirit  not convert all the unwilling sinners in the community where it does  convert sinners? These are questions that have been asked in a great many  hearts before they yielded themselves up to skepticism and infidelity.    In the present stage of critical investigation it is well for all  preachers to remember that there is but one question involving this whole  matter of conversion and pardon, and that is the question coupled with the  Judgment; it is not, How much did the Heavenly Father love me? He loved  all men. It is not, How much did Jesus do for _me_? He tasted death for  every man. It is not, How much has the Spirit done for me? It gave the  gospel to all nations, as the power of God unto salvation to every man  that believeth. The one, and only, question in the Judgment is, What have  I done for myself? What are the deeds done in my body? the deeds which _I  have done_.    Christianity is right thinking and doing; all that is to be attained in  the religion of Christ is enjoyed in an upright life. Every theory that  conflicts with this grand sentiment is smoked with the darkness of the  dark ages. The Father of Spirits made us with the power of choice--gave us  the liberty to choose--and we all may have, in the future, just such a  state as we will. The Father loved all; the Son died for all; and the  Spirit says to all, COME!    The great struggle that is now going on between Christianity and unbelief  is accomplishing two good things: First, it is making it hard for  professors of religion to hold their errors, or cover up hypocrisy; and  second, it is making it hard for infidels and skeptics to hold on to their  flimsy objections to the Christian religion. Let the struggle go on!            THE RECORDS RESPECTING THE DEATH OF THOMAS PAINE.      That he bitterly regretted the writing and the publishing of the _Age of  Reason_ we have incontestable proof. During his last illness he asked a  pious young woman, Mary Roscoe, a Quakeress, who frequently visited him,  if she had ever read any of his writings, and being told that she had read  very little of them he inquired what she thought of them, adding, \"From  such a one as you I expect a true answer.\" She told him, when very young  she had read his _Age of Reason_, but the more she read of it the more  dark and distressed she felt, and she threw it into the fire. \"I wish all  had done as you,\" he replied, \"for if the devil ever had an agency in any  work, he has had it in writing that book.\"--_Journal of Stephen Grellet,  1809._    Dr. Manley, who was with him during his last hours, in a letter to  Cheetham, in 1809, writes: \"He could not be left alone night or day. He  not only required to have some person with him, but he must see that he or  she was there, and if, as it would sometimes happen, he was left alone, he  would scream and halloo until some person came to him. There was something  remarkable in his conduct about this period, which comprises about two  weeks immediately preceding his death. He would call out during his  paroxysms of distress, without intermission, 'O Lord, help me! God, help  me! Jesus Christ, help me! O Lord, help me!' etc., repeating the same  expressions without the least variation, in a tone of voice that would  alarm the house. It was this conduct which induced me to think that he  abandoned his former opinions, and I was more inclined to that belief when  I understood from his nurse, who is a very serious, and I believe pious  woman, that he would occasionally inquire, when he saw her engaged with a  book, what she was reading, and being answered, and at the same time asked  whether she should read aloud, he assented, and would appear to give  particular attention. The doctor asked him if he believed that Jesus  Christ is the Son of God? After a pause of some minutes he replied, 'I  have no wish to believe on that subject.' 'For my own part,' says the  doctor, 'I believe that had not Thomas Paine been such a distinguished  infidel he would have left less equivocal evidences of a change of  opinion.' \"    The Roman Catholic Bishop, Fenwick, says: \"A short time before Paine died  I was sent for by him.\" He was prompted to do this by a poor Catholic  woman who went to see him in his sickness, and who told him if anybody  could do him any good it was the Catholic priest. \"I was accompanied by F.  Kohlman, an intimate friend. We found him at a house in Greenwich, now  Greenwich street, New York, where he lodged. A decent-looking, elderly  woman came to the door, and inquired whether we were the Catholic priests;  'for,' said she, 'Mr. Paine has been so much annoyed of late by other  denominations calling upon him, that he has left express orders to admit  no one but the clergymen of the Catholic church.' Upon informing her who  we were, she opened the door and showed us into the parlor. 'Gentlemen,'  said the lady, 'I really wish you may succeed with Mr. Paine, for he is  laboring under great distress of mind every since he was told by his  physicians that he can not possibly live, and must die shortly. He is  truly to be pitied. His cries, when left alone, are heart-rending. \"O  Lord, help me!\" he will exclaim during his paroxysms of distress: \"God,  help me! Jesus Christ, help me!\" Repeating these expressions in a tone of  voice that would alarm the house. Sometimes he will say, \"O God, what have  I done to suffer so much?\" Then shortly after, \"but there is no God,\" then  again, \"yet if there should be, what would become of me hereafter?\" Thus  he will continue for some time, when, on a sudden, he will scream as if in  terror and agony, and call for me by name. On one occasion I inquired what  he wanted. \"Stay with me,\" he replied, \"for God's sake, for I can not bear  to be left alone.\" I told him I could not always be in the room. \"Then,\"  said he, \"_send even a child to stay with me, for it is a hell to be  alone._\" _I never saw_,' she continued, '_a more unhappy, a more forsaken  man. It seems he can not reconcile himself to die._'    \"Such was the conversation of the woman, who was a Protestant, and who  seemed very desirous that we should afford him some relief in a state  bordering on complete despair. Having remained some time in the parlor, we  at length heard a noise in the adjoining room. We proposed to enter, which  was assented to by the woman, who opened the door for us. A more wretched  being in appearance I never beheld. He was lying in a bed sufficiently  decent in itself, but at present besmeared with filth; his look was that  of a man greatly tortured in mind, his eyes haggard, his countenance  forbidding, and his whole appearance that of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#8)"],[1,"s,  chaste and fair,\" the abbess, as Paul de Saint-Victor calls her, of  the woodlands, is a beautiful and natural fancy, which requires no  explanation. On the other hand, the Artemis of Arcadia, who is confused  with the nymph Callisto, who, again, is said to have become a she-bear,  and later a star; and the Brauronian Artemis, whose maiden ministers  danced a bear-dance,(2) are goddesses whose legend seems unnatural,  and needs to be made intelligible. Or, again, there is nothing not  explicable and natural in the conception of the Olympian Zeus as  represented by the great chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia,  or in the Homeric conception of Zeus as a god who \"turns everywhere his  shining eyes, and beholds all things, and protects the righteous, and  deals good or evil fortune to men.\" But the Zeus whose grave was shown in  Crete, or the Zeus who played Demeter an obscene trick by the aid of  a ram, or the Zeus who, in the shape of a swan, became the father of  Castor and Pollux, or the Zeus who deceived Hera by means of a feigned  marriage with an inanimate object, or the Zeus who was afraid of Attes,  or the Zeus who made love to women in the shape of an ant or a cuckoo,  is a being whose myth is felt to be unnatural and bewildering.(3) It  is this IRRATIONAL and unnatural element, as Mr. Max Muller says, \"the  silly, senseless, and savage element,\" that makes mythology the puzzle  which men have so long found it. For, observe, Greek myth does  not represent merely a humorous play of fancy, dealing with things  religiously sacred as if by way of relief from the strained reverential  contemplation of the majesty of Zeus. Many stories of Greek mythology  are such as could not cross, for the first time, the mind of a civilised  Xenophanes or Theagenes, even in a dream. THIS was the real puzzle.      (1) Odyssey, vi. 102.    (2) (Greek word omitted); compare Harpokration on this word.    (3) These are the features in myth which provoke, for example, the  wonder of Emeric-David. \"The lizard, the wolf, the dog, the ass,  the frog, and all the other brutes so common on religious monuments  everywhere, do they not all imply a THOUGHT which we must divine?\" He  concludes that these animals, plants, and monsters of myths are so many  \"enigmas\" and \"symbols\" veiling some deep, sacred idea, allegories of  some esoteric religious creed. Jupiter, Paris, 1832, p. lxxvii.      We have offered examples--Savage, Indian, and Greek--of that element in  mythology which, as all civilised races have felt, demands explanation.    To be still more explicit, we may draw up a brief list of the chief  problems in the legendary stories attached to the old religions of the  world--the problems which it is our special purpose to notice. First we  have, in the myths of all races, the most grotesque conceptions of the  character of gods when mythically envisaged. Beings who, in religion,  leave little to be desired, and are spoken of as holy, immortal,  omniscient, and kindly, are, in myth, represented as fashioned in the  likeness not only of man, but of the beasts; as subject to death, as  ignorant and impious.    Most pre-Christian religions had their \"zoomorphic\" or partially  zoomorphic idols, gods in the shape of the lower animals, or with the  heads and necks of the lower animals. In the same way all mythologies  represent the gods as fond of appearing in animal forms. Under these  disguises they conduct many amours, even with the daughters of men, and  Greek houses were proud of their descent from Zeus in the shape of an  eagle or ant, a serpent or a swan; while Cronus and the Vedic Tvashtri  and Poseidon made love as horses, and Apollo as a dog. Not less wild  are the legends about the births of gods from the thigh, or the head,  or feet, or armpits of some parent; while tales describing and pictures  representing unspeakable divine obscenities were frequent in the  mythology and in the temples of Greece. Once more, the gods were said  to possess and exercise the power of turning men and women into birds,  beasts, fishes, trees, and stones, so that there was scarcely a familiar  natural object in the Greek world which had not once (according to  legend) been a man or a woman. The myths of the origin of the world and  man, again, were in the last degree childish and disgusting. The Bushmen  and Australians have, perhaps, no story of the origin of species quite  so barbarous in style as the anecdotes about Phanes and Prajapati which  are preserved in the Orphic hymns and in the Brahmanas. The conduct  of the earlier dynasties of classical gods towards each other was as  notoriously cruel and loathsome as their behaviour towards mortals was  tricksy and capricious. The classical gods, with all their immortal  might, are, by a mythical contradiction of the religious conception,  regarded as capable of fear and pain, and are led into scrapes as  ludicrous as those of Brer Wolf or Brer Terrapin in the tales of  the Negroes of the Southern States of America. The stars, again,  in mythology, are mixed up with beasts, planets and men in the same  embroglio of fantastic opinion. The dead and the living, men, beasts and  gods, trees and stars, and rivers, and sun, and moon, dance through the  region of myths in a burlesque ballet of Priapus, where everything may  be anything, where nature has no laws and imagination no limits.    Such are the irrational characteristics of myths, classic or Indian,  European or American, African or Asiatic, Australian or Maori. Such  is one element we find all the world over among civilised and savage  people, quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus. It is no wonder that  pious and reflective men have, in so many ages and in so many ways,  tried to account to themselves for their possession of beliefs closely  connected with religion which yet seemed ruinous to religion and  morality.    The explanations which men have given of their own sacred stories, the  apologies for their own gods which they have been constrained to offer  to themselves, were the earliest babblings of a science of mythology.  That science was, in its dim beginnings, intended to satisfy a moral  need. Man found that his gods, when mythically envisaged, were not made  in his own moral image at its best, but in the image sometimes of the  beasts, sometimes of his own moral nature at its very worst: in the  likeness of robbers, wizards, sorcerers, and adulterers. Now, it  is impossible here to examine minutely all systems of mythological  interpretation. Every key has been tried in this difficult lock; every  cause of confusion has been taken up and tested, deemed adequate, and  finally rejected or assigned a subordinate place. Probably the first  attempts to shake off the burden of religious horror at mythical impiety  were made by way of silent omission. Thus most of the foulest myths of  early India are absent, and presumably were left out, in the Rig-Veda.  \"The religious sentiment of the hymns, already so elevated, has  discarded most of the tales which offended it, but has not succeeded  in discarding them all.\"(1) Just as the poets of the Rig-Veda prefer to  avoid the more offensive traditions about Indra and Tvashtri, so Homer  succeeds in avoiding the more grotesque and puerile tales about his own  gods.(2) The period of actual apology comes later. Pindar declines, as  we have seen, to accuse a god of cannibalism. The Satapatha Brahmana  invents a new story about the slaying of Visvarupa. Not Indra, but  Trita, says the Brahmana apologetically, slew the three-headed son of  Tvashtri. \"Indra assuredly was free from that sin, for he is a god,\"  says the Indian apologist.(3) Yet sins which to us appear far more  monstrous than the peccadillo of killing a three-headed Brahman are  attributed freely to Indra.      (1) Les Religions de l'Inde, Barth, p. 14. See also postea, \"Indian  Myths\".    (2) The reasons for Homer's reticence are probably different in  different passages. Perhaps in some cases he had heard a purer version  of myth than what reached Hesiod; perhaps he sometimes purposely (like  Pindar) purified a myth; usually he must have selected, in conformity  with the noble humanity and purity of his taste, the tales that best  conformed to his ideal. He makes his deities reluctant to drag out in  dispute old scandals of their early unheroic adventures, some of which,  however, he gives, as the kicking of Hephaestus out of heaven, and the  imprisonment of Ares in a vessel of bronze. Compare Professor Jebb's  Homer, p. 83: \"whatever the instinct of the great artist has tolerated,  at least it has purged these things away.\" that is, divine amours in  bestial form.    (3) Satapatha Brahmana, Oxford, 1882, vol. i. p. 47.      While poets could but omit a blasphemous tale or sketch an apology  in passing, it became the business of philosophers and of antiquarian  writers deliberately to \"whitewash\" the gods of popular religion.  Systematic explanations of the sacred stories, whether as preserved  in poetry or as told by priests, had to be provided. India had her  etymological and her legendary school of mythology.(1) Thus, while the  hymn SEEMED to tell how the Maruts were gods, \"born together with the  spotted deer,\" the etymological interpreters explained that the word for  deer only meant the many-coloured lines of clouds.(2) In the armoury of  apologetics etymology has been the most serviceable weapon. It is  easy to see that by aid of etymology the most repulsive legend may be  compelled to yield a pure or harmless sense, and may be explained as  an innocent blunder, caused by mere verbal misunderstanding. Brahmans,  Greeks, and Germans have equally found comfort in this hypothesis. In  the Cratylus of Plato, Socrates speaks of the notion of explaining myths  by etymological guesses at the meaning of divine names as \"a philosophy  which came to him all in an instant\". Thus we find Socrates shocked by  the"]]]
