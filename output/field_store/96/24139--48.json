When this mucus adheres long to the papillae  of the tongue, the saliva, which it contains in its interstices, like a  sponge, is liable to become putrid, and to acquire a bitter taste, like  other putrid animal substances; which is generally mistaken for an  indication of the presence of bile.    M. M. Warm subacid liquids. See Class I. 2. 5. 8.    2. _Fauces aridae._ Dry throat. The expuition of a frothy mucus with great  and perpetual hawking occurs in hydrophobia, and is very distressing to the  patient; which may be owing to the increased irritability or sensibility of  the upper part of the oesophagus, which will not permit any fluid to rest  on it.    It affects some people after intoxication, when the lungs remain slightly  inflamed, and by the greater heat of the air in expiration the mucus  becomes too hastily evaporated, and is expectorated with difficulty in the  state of white froth.    I knew a person, who for twenty years always waked with his tongue and  throat quite dry; so that he was necessitated to take a spoonful of water,  as soon as he awoke; otherwise a little blood always followed the forcible  expuition of the indurated mucus from his fauces. See Class II. 1. 3. 17.    M. M. Steel-springs fixed to the night-cap so as to suspend the lower jaw  and keep it closed; or springs of elastic gum. Or a pot of water suspended  over the bed, with a piece of list, or woollen cloth, depending from it,  and held in the mouth; which will act like a syphon, and slowly supply  moisture, or barley water should be frequently syringed into the mouth of  the patient.    3. _Nares aridi._ Dry nostrils with the mucus hardening upon their internal  surface, so as to cover them with a kind of skin or scale, owing to the  increased action of the absorbents of this membrane; or to the too great  dryness of the air, which passes into the lungs; or too great heat of it in  its expiration.    When air is so dry as to lose its transparency; as when a tremulous motion  of it can be seen over corn fields in a hot summer's day; or when a dry  mist, or want of transparency of the air, is visible in very hot weather;  the sense of smell is at the same time imperfect from the dryness of the  membrane, beneath which it is spread.    4. _Expectoratio solida._ Solid expectoration. The mucus of the lungs  becomes hardened by the increased absorption, so that it adheres and forms  a kind of lining in the air-cells, and is sometimes spit up in the form of  branching vessels, which are called polypi of the lungs. See Transact. of  the College, London. There is a rattling or weezing of the breath, but it  is not at first attended with inflammation.    The Cynanche trachealis, or Croup, of Dr. Cullen, or Angina polyposa of  Michaelis, if they differ from the peripneumony of infants, seem to belong  to this genus. When the difficulty of respiration is great, venesection is  immediately necessary, and then an emetic, and a blister. And the child  should be kept nearly upright in bed as much as may be. See Tonsillitis,  Class II. 1. 3. 3.    M. M. Diluents, emetics, essence of antimony, foetid gums, onions, warm  bath for half an hour every day for a month. Inhaling the steam of water,  with or without volatile alcali. Soap.    5. _Constipatio alvi._ Costiveness from increased action of the intestinal  absorbents. The feces are hardened in lumps called scybala; which are  sometimes obliged to be extracted from the rectum with a kind of marrow  spoon. This is said to have happened from the patient having taken much  rust of iron. The mucus is also hardened so as to line the intestines, and  to come away in skins, rolled up as they pass along, so as to resemble  worms, for which they are frequently mistaken; and sometimes it is  evacuated in still larger pieces, so as to counterfeit the form of the  intestines, and has been mistaken for a portion of them. Balls of this  kind, nearly as heavy as marble, and considerably hard, from two inches to  five in diameter, are frequently found in the bowels of horses. Similar  balls found in goats have been called Bezoar.    M. M. Cathartics, Diluents, fruit, oil, soap, sulphur, warm bath.  Sprinkling with cold water, cool clothing. See Class I. 2. 4. 18.    6. _Cutis arida._ Dry skin. This dry skin is not attended with coldness as  in the beginning of fever-fits. Where this cutaneous absorption is great,  and the secreted material upon it viscid, as on the hairy scalp, the skin  becomes covered with hardened mucus; which adheres so as not to be easily  removed, as the scurf on the head; but is not attended with inflammation  like the Tinea, or Lepra. The moisture, which appears on the skin beneath  resinous or oily plasters, or which is seen to adhere to such plasters, is  owing to their preventing the exhalation of the perspirable matter, and not  to their increasing the production of it, as some have idly imagined.    M. M. Warm bathing, oil externally, oil-skin gloves, resinous plasters.  Wax.    7. _Urina parca colorata._ Diminished urine, which is high coloured, and  deposits an earthy sediment, when cold, is owing to the great action of the  urinary absorbents. See Class I. 1. 2. 4. In some dropsies the cutaneous  absorbents are paralytic, as well as those opening into the cellular  membrane; and hence, no moisture being acquired from the atmosphere, or  from the cellular membrane, great thirst is excited; and great absorption  from all parts, where the absorbents are still capable of action. Hence the  urine is in very small quantity, and of deep colour, with copious sediment;  and the kidneys are erroneously blamed for not doing their office;  stimulant diuretic medicines are given in vain; and very frequently the  unhappy patient is restrained from quenching his thirst, and dies a martyr  to false theory.    M. M. Diluent liquids, and warm bathing, are the natural cure of this  symptom; but it generally attends those dropsies, which are seldom curable;  as they are owing to a paralysis both of the cutaneous and cellular  lymphatics.    8. _Calculus felleus._ Gall-stone. From the too hasty absorption of the  thinner parts of the bile, the remainder is left too viscid, and  crystallizes into lumps; which, if too large to pass, obstruct the ductus  choledochus, producing pain at the pit of the stomach, and jaundice. When  the indurated bile is not harder than a boiled pea, it may pass through the  bile-duct with difficulty by changing its form; and thus gives those pains,  which have been called spasms of the stomach; and yet these viscid lumps of  bile may afterwards dissolve, and not be visible among the feces.    In two instances I have seen from thirty to fifty gall-stones voided after  taking an oil vomit as below. They were about the size of peas, and  distinguishable when dry by their being inflammable like bad wax, when put  into the flame of a candle. For other causes of jaundice, see Class I. 2.  4. 19.    M. M. Diluents, daily warm bathing. Ether mixed with yolk of egg and water.  Unboiled acrid vegetables, as lettice, cabbage, mustard, and cresses. When  in violent pain, four ounces of oil of olives, or of almonds, should be  swallowed; and as much more in a quarter of an hour, whether it stays or  not. The patient should lie on the circumference of a large barrel, first  on one side, and then on the other. Electric shocks through the gall-duct.  Factitious Selter's water made by dissolving one dram of Sal Soda in a pint  of water; to half a pint of which made luke-warm add ten drops of marine  acid; to be drank as soon as mixed, twice a day for some months. Opium must  be used to quiet the pain, if the oil does not succeed, as two grains, and  another grain in half an hour if necessary. See Class IV. 2. 2. 4.    9. _Calculus renis._ Stone of the kidney. The pain in the loins and along  the course of the ureter from a stone is attended with retraction of the  testicle in men, and numbness on the inside of the thigh in women. It is  distinguished from the lumbago or sciatica, as these latter are seldom  attended with vomiting, and have pain on the outside of the thigh,  sometimes quite down to the ankle or heel. See Herpes and Nephritis.    Where the absorption of the thinner parts of the secretion takes place too  hastily in the kidnies, the hardened mucus, and consequent calculous  concretions, sometimes totally stop up the tubuli uriniferi; and no urine  is secreted. Of this many die, who have drank much vinous spirit, and some  of them recover by voiding a quantity of white mucus, like chalk and water;  and others by voiding a great quantity of sand, or small calculi. This  hardened mucus frequently becomes the nucleus of a stone in the bladder.  The salts of the urine, called microcosmic salt, are often mistaken for  gravel, but are distinguishable both by their angles of crystallization,  their adhesion to the sides or bottom of the pot, and by their not being  formed till the urine cools. Whereas the particles of gravel are generally  without angles, and always drop to the bottom of the vessel, immediately as  the water is voided.    Though the proximate cause of the formation of the calculous concretions of  the kidneys, and of chalk-stones in the gout, and of the insoluble  concretions of coagulable lymph, which are found on membranes, which have  been inflamed in peripneumony, or rheumatism, consists in the too great  action of the absorbent vessels of those parts; yet the remote cause in  these cases is probably owing to the inflammation of the membranes; which  at that time are believed to secrete a material more liable to coagulate or  concrete, than they would otherwise produce by increased action alone  without the production of new vessels, which constitutes inflammation.

Television - broadcast stations  This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus  any repeater stations.    Televisions  This entry gives the total number of television sets.    Terminology  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word Country  in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies,  areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities  in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.  Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense,  security, and defense activities in many entries. The Independence  entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling  states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency  status noted in this same entry.    Terrain  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Total fertility rate  This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each  age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of  fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per  woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the  country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force  participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women  indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of the  families to feed and educate their children.    Transnational Issues  This category includes only two entries at the present time - Disputes  - international and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going  beyond national boundaries.    Transportation  This category includes the entries dealing with the means for movement  of people and goods.    Transportation - note  This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Unemployment rate  This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without  jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Waterways  This entry gives the total length and individual names of navigable  rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.    Years  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as  fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting period of 12  months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is an accounting  period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.
