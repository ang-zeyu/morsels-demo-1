According, however, to the chronological list of Suras  given by Weil (Leben M. p. 364) from ancient tradition, as well as from the  consentient voice of tradionists and commentaries (v. Nöld. Geschichte, p.  69; Sprengers Life of Mohammad, p. 111) it was the next revealed after the  Fatrah, and the designation to the prophetic office.  The main features of  the tradition are, that Muhammad while wandering about in the hills near  Mecca, distracted by doubts and by anxiety after truth, had a vision of the  Angel Gabriel seated on a throne between heaven and earth, that he ran to his  wife, Chadijah, in the greatest alarm, and desired her, perhaps from  superstitious motives (and believing that if covered with clothes he should  be shielded from the glances of evil spirits-comp. Stanley on I Cor. xi. 10),  to envelope him in his mantle; that then Gabriel came down and addressed him  as in v. I.  This vision, like that which preceded Sura xcvi., may actually  have occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits from  which Muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered.  Hence Muhammad in  Sura lxxxi. appeals to it as a matter of fact, and such he doubtless believe  it to be.  It may here be observed, that however absurd the Muslim traditions  may be in many of their details, it will generally be found that where there  is an ancient and tolerably universal consent, there will be found at the  bottom a residuum of fact and historical truth.  At the same time there can  be no doubt but that the details of the traditions are too commonly founded  upon the attempt to explain or to throw light upon a dark passage of the  Koran, and are pure inventions of a later age.    2 The Arabic words are not those used in later Suras to express the same  idea.    3  Said to be Walid b. Mogheira, a person of note among the unbelieving  Meccans.  This portion of the Sura seems to be of a different date from the  first seven verses, though very ancient, and the change of subject is similar  to that at v. 9 of the previous Sura.    4 This and the three following verses wear the appearance of having been  inserted at a later period to meet objections respecting the number of the  angels who guard hell, raised by the Jews; perhaps at Medina, as the four  classes of persons specified are those whom Muhammad had to deal with in that  city, viz., the Jews, Believers, the Hypocrites, or undecided, and Idolaters.  These are constantly mentioned together in the Medina Suras.    5 That is, who believe, and do not believe.    6 As the word sakar disturbs the rhyme, it may have been inserted by a  mistake of the copyist for the usual word, which suits it.    7 That is, death.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    O THOU ENFOLDED in thy mantle,    Stand up all night, except a small portion of it, for prayer:    Half; or curtail the half a little,-    Or add to it: And with measured tone intone the Koran,2    For we shall devolve on thee weighty words.    Verily, at the oncoming of night are devout impressions strongest, and words  are most collected;3    But in the day time thou hast continual employ-    And commemorate the name of thy Lord, and devote thyself to Him with entire  devotion.    Lord of the East and of the West! No God is there but He! Take Him for thy  protector,    And endure what they say with patience, and depart from them with a decorous  departure.    And let Me alone with the gainsayers, rich in the pleasures of this life; and  bear thou with them yet a little while:    For with Us are strong fetters, and a flaming fire,    And food that choketh, and a sore torment.    The day cometh when the earth and the mountains shall be shaken; and the  mountains shall become a loose sand heap.    Verily, we have sent you an Apostle to witness against you, even as we sent  an Apostle to Pharaoh:    But Pharaoh rebelled against the Apostle, and we therefore laid hold on him  with a severe chastisement.    And how, if ye believe not, will you screen yourselves from the day that  shall turn children greyheaded?    The very heaven shall be reft asunder by it: this threat shall be carried  into effect.    Lo! this is a warning. Let him then who will, take the way to his Lord.    Of a truth,4 thy Lord knoweth that thou prayest almost two-thirds, or half,  or a third of the night, as do a part of thy followers. But God measureth the  night and the day:  He knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and  therefore, turneth to you mercifully. Recite then so much of the Koran as may  be easy to you. He knoweth that there will be some among you sick, while  others travel through the earth in quest of the bounties of God; and others  do battle in his cause. Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy. And  observe the Prayers and pay the legal Alms,5 and lend God a liberal loan: for  whatever good works ye send on before for your own behoof, ye shall find with  God. This will be best and richest in the recompense. And seek the  forgiveness of God: verily, God is forgiving, Merciful.      _______________________    1 From the first line of this Sura, and its expressions concerning the Koran,  Prayer, and Future Punishment: from the similarity of the tradition with  regard to its having been preceded by a vision of Gabriel (Beidh., etc.), it  seems to belong to, or at least to describe, a period, perhaps immediately  succeeding the Fatrah, during which the hours of night were spent by Muhammad  in devotion and in the labour of working up his materials in rhythmical and  rhyming Suras, and in preparation for the public assumption of the prophetic  office. Comp. especially verses 11, 19, 20, at the end, with 11, 54, 55, of  the preceding Sura.    2 Singe den Koran laut. H.v.P. Psalle Alcoranum psallendo. Mar.

Ullm.    3 Lit. most firm, perhaps, distinct.    4 This verse, according to a tradition of Ayesha, was revealed one year later  than the previous part of the Sura. Nöldeke says it is \"offenbar ein  Medinischer.\"    5 The reader will not be surprised to find in the very outset of Muhammad's  career a frequent mention of Alms, Prayer, Heaven, Hell, Judgment, Apostles,  etc., in their usual sense, when he remembers that Judaism was extensively  naturalised in Arabia, and Christianity, also, although to a smaller extent.  The words and phrases of these religions were doubtless familiar to the  Meccans, especially to that numerous body who were anxiously searching after  some better religion than the idolatries of their fathers (v. on Sura iii.  19, 60), and provided Muhammad with a copious fund from which to draw.      SURA XCIII.1-THE BRIGHTNESS [IV.]    MECCA.-11 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    BY the noon-day BRIGHTNESS,    And by the night when it darkeneth!    Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither hath he been displeased.    And surely the Future shall be better for thee than the Past,    And in the end shall thy Lord be bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied.    Did he not find thee an orphan2 and gave thee a home?    And found thee erring and guided thee,3    And found thee needy and enriched thee.    As to the orphan therefore wrong him not;    And as to him that asketh of thee, chide him not away;    And as for the favours of thy Lord tell them abroad.      _______________________    1 This and the six following Suras are expressions of a state of deep mental  anxiety and depression, in which Muhammad seeks to reassure himself by  calling to mind the past favours of God, and by fixing his mind steadfastly  on the Divine Unity. They belong to a period either before the public  commencement of his ministry or when his success was very dubious, and his  future career by no means clearly marked out.    2 The charge of the orphaned Muhammad was undertaken by Abd-al-Mutalib, his  grandfather, A.D. 576. Hishami, p. 35; Kitab al Wakidi, p. 22, have preserved  traditions of the fondness with which the old man of fourscore years treated  the child, spreading a rug for him under the shadow of the Kaaba, protecting  him from the rudeness of his own sons, etc.    3 Up to his 40th year Muhammad followed the religion of his countrymen. Waq.  Tabari says that when he first entered on his office of Prophet, even his  wife Chadijah had read the Scriptures, and was acquainted with the History of  the Prophets. Spreng. p. 100. But his conformity can only have been partial.

And taken off from thee thy burden,    Which galled thy back?    And have we not raised thy name for thee?    Then verily along with trouble cometh ease.    Verily along with trouble cometh ease.    But when thou art set at liberty, then prosecute thy toil.    And seek thy Lord with fervour.

Such unfortunates could hardly do better than to court the  society of the joyous tit. His whistles and chirps, his graceful feats  of climbing and hanging, and withal his engaging familiarity (for, of  course, such good-nature as his could not consist with suspiciousness)  would most likely send them home in a more Christian mood. The time will  come, we may hope, when doctors will prescribe bird-gazing instead of  blue-pill.    To illustrate the chickadee's trustfulness, I may mention that a friend  of mine captured one in a butterfly-net, and, carrying him into the  house, let him loose in the sitting-room. The little stranger was at  home immediately, and seeing the window full of plants, proceeded to go  over them carefully, picking off the lice with which such window-gardens  are always more or less infested. A little later he was taken into my  friend's lap, and soon he climbed up to his shoulder; where, after  hopping about for a few minutes on his coat-collar, he selected a  comfortable roosting place, tucked his head under his wing, and went to  sleep, and slept on undisturbed while carried from one room to another.  Probably the chickadee's nature is not of the deepest. I have never seen  him when his joy rose to ecstasy. Still his feelings are not shallow,  and the faithfulness of the pair to each other and to their offspring is  of the highest order. The female has sometimes to be taken off the nest,  and even to be held in the hand, before the eggs can be examined.    Our American goldfinch is one of the loveliest of birds. With his  elegant plumage, his rhythmical, undulatory flight, his beautiful song,  and his more beautiful soul, he ought to be one of the best beloved, if  not one of the most famous; but he has never yet had half his deserts.  He is like the chickadee, and yet different. He is not so extremely  confiding, nor should I call him merry. But he is always cheerful, in  spite of his so-called plaintive note, from which he gets one of his  names, and always amiable. So far as I know, he never utters a harsh  sound; even the young ones, asking for food, use only smooth, musical  tones. During the pairing season his delight often becomes rapturous. To  see him then, hovering and singing,--or, better still, to see the  devoted pair hovering together, billing and singing,--is enough to do  even a cynic good. The happy lovers! They have never read it in a book,  but it is written on their hearts,--        \"The gentle law, that each should be      The other's heaven and harmony.\"    The goldfinch has the advantage of the titmouse in several respects, but  he lacks that sprightliness, that exceeding light-heartedness, which is  the chickadee's most endearing characteristic.    For the sake of a strong contrast, we may look next at the brown thrush,  known to farmers as the planting-bird and to ornithologists as  _Harporhynchus rufus_; a staid and solemn Puritan, whose creed is the  Preacher's,--\"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.\" No frivolity and  merry-making for him! After his brief annual period of intensely  passionate song, he does penance for the remainder of the  year,--skulking about, on the ground or near it, silent and gloomy. He  seems ever on the watch against an enemy, and, unfortunately for his  comfort, he has nothing of the reckless, bandit spirit, such as the jay  possesses, which goes to make a moderate degree of danger almost a  pastime. Not that he is without courage; when his nest is in question he  will take great risks; but in general his manner is dispirited,  \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.\" Evidently he feels        \"The heavy and the weary weight      Of all this unintelligible world;\"    and it would not be surprising if he sometimes raised the question, \"Is  life worth living?\" It is the worst feature of his case that his  melancholy is not of the sort which softens and refines the nature.  There is no suggestion of saintliness about it. In fact, I am convinced  that this long-tailed thrush has a constitutional taint of vulgarity.  His stealthy, underhand manner is one mark of this, and the same thing  comes out again in his music. Full of passion as his singing is (and we  have hardly anything to compare with it in this regard), yet the  listener cannot help smiling now and then; the very finest passage is  followed so suddenly by some uncouth guttural note, or by some whimsical  drop from the top to the bottom of the scale.    In neighborly association with the brown thrush is the towhee bunting,  or chewink. The two choose the same places for their summer homes, and,  unless I am deceived, they often migrate in company. But though they are  so much together, and in certain of their ways very much alike, their  habits of mind are widely dissimilar. The towhee is of a peculiarly even  disposition. I have seldom heard him scold, or use any note less  good-natured and musical than his pleasant _cherawink_. I have never  detected him in a quarrel such as nearly all birds are once in a while  guilty of, ungracious as it may seem to mention the fact; nor have I  ever seen him hopping nervously about and twitching his tail, as is the  manner of most species, when, for instance, their nests are approached.  Nothing seems to annoy him. At the same time, he is not full of  continual merriment like the chickadee, nor occasionally in a rapture  like the goldfinch. Life with him is pitched in a low key; comfortable  rather than cheerful, and never jubilant. And yet, for all the towhee's  careless demeanor, you soon begin to suspect him of being deep. He  appears not to mind you; he keeps on scratching among the dry leaves as  if he had no thought of being driven away by your presence; but in a  minute or two you look that way again, and he is not there. If you pass  near his nest, he makes not a tenth part of the ado which a brown thrush  would make in the same circumstances, but (partly for this reason) you  will find half a dozen nests of the thrush sooner than one of his. With  all his simplicity and frankness, which puts him in happy contrast with  the thrush, he knows as well as anybody how to keep his own counsel. I  have seen him with his mate for two or three days together about the  flower-beds in the Boston Public Garden, and so far as appeared they  were feeding as unconcernedly as though they had been on their own  native heath, amid the scrub-oaks and huckleberry bushes; but after  their departure it was remembered that they had not once been heard to  utter a sound. If self-possession be four fifths of good manners, our  red-eyed Pipilo may certainly pass for a gentleman.    We have now named four birds, the chickadee, the goldfinch, the brown  thrush, and the towhee,--birds so diverse in plumage that no eye could  fail to discriminate them at a glance. But the four differ no more truly  in bodily shape and dress than they do in that inscrutable something  which we call temperament, disposition. If the soul of each were  separated from the body and made to stand out in sight, those of us who  have really known the birds in the flesh would have no difficulty in  saying, This is the titmouse, and this the towhee. It would be with them  as we hope it will be with our friends in the next world, whom we shall  recognize there because we knew them here; that is, we knew _them_, and  not merely the bodies they lived in. This kind of familiarity with birds  has no necessary connection with ornithology. Personal intimacy and a  knowledge of anatomy are still two different things. As we have all  heard, ours is an age of science; but, thank fortune, matters have not  yet gone so far that a man must take a course in anthropology before he  can love his neighbor.    It is a truth only too patent that taste and conscience are sometimes at  odds. One man wears his faults so gracefully that we can hardly help  falling in love with them, while another, alas, makes even virtue itself  repulsive. I am moved to this commonplace reflection by thinking of the  blue jay, a bird of doubtful character, but one for whom, nevertheless,  it is impossible not to feel a sort of affection and even of respect. He  is quite as suspicious as the brown thrush, and his instinct for an  invisible perch is perhaps as unerring as the cuckoo's; and yet, even  when he takes to hiding, his manner is not without a dash of boldness.  He has a most irascible temper, also, but, unlike the thrasher, he does  not allow his ill-humor to degenerate into chronic sulkiness. Instead,  he flies into a furious passion, and is done with it. Some say that on  such occasions he swears, and I have myself seen him when it was plain  that nothing except a natural impossibility kept him from tearing his  hair. His larynx would make him a singer, and his mental capacity is far  above the average; but he has perverted his gifts, till his music is  nothing but noise and his talent nothing but smartness. A like process  of depravation the world has before now witnessed in political life,  when a man of brilliant natural endowments has yielded to low ambitions  and stooped to unworthy means, till what was meant to be a statesman  turns put to be a demagogue. But perhaps we wrong our handsome friend,  fallen angel though he be, to speak thus of him. Most likely he would  resent the comparison, and I do not press it. We must admit that  juvenile sportsmen have persecuted him unduly; and when a creature  cannot show himself without being shot at, he may be pardoned for a  little misanthropy. Christians as we are, how many of us could stand  such a test? In these circumstances, it is a point in the jay's favor  that he still has, what is rare with birds, a sense of humor, albeit it  is humor of a rather grim sort,--the sort which expends itself in"]]]
