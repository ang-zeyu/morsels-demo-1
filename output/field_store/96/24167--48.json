Ritson, in       his Historical Essay on _Scottish Song_, speaks of some of       these, with a zest, as if he longed to untie the \"whip-cord\"       packet.]    While the country was thus giving proofs of the prevalence of this  disorder, the two Harringtons (especially the younger)[28] and the  illustrious Spenser[29] were unfortunately seized with it in the  metropolis.         [Footnote 28: SIR JOHN HARRINGTON, knt. Sir John, and his       father John Harrington, were very considerable literary       characters in the 16th century; and whoever has been       fortunate enough to read through Mr. Park's new edition of       the _Nugae Antiquae_, 1804, 8vo., will meet with numerous       instances in which the son displays considerable       bibliographical knowledge--especially in _Italian_       literature; Harrington and Spenser seem to have been the       Matthias and Roscoe of the day. I make no doubt but that the       former was as thoroughly acquainted with the _vera edizione_       of the Giuntae edition of Boccaccio's Decamerone, 1527, 4to.,       as either Haym, Orlandi, or Bandini. Paterson, with all his       skill, was mistaken in this article when he catalogued       Croft's books. See Bibl. Crofts. No. 3976: his true       edition was knocked down for 6_s._!!!]         [Footnote 29: Spenser's general acquaintance with Italian       literature has received the best illustration in Mr. Todd's       Variorum edition of the poet's works; where the reader will       find, in the notes, a constant succession of anecdotes of,       and references to, the state of anterior and contemporaneous       literature, foreign and domestic.]    In the seventeenth century, from the death of Elizabeth to the  commencement of Anne's reign, it seems to have made considerable  havoc; yet, such was our blindness to it that we scrupled not to  engage in overtures for the purchase of Isaac Vossius's[30] fine  library, enriched with many treasures from the Queen of Sweden's,  which this versatile genius scrupled not to pillage without confession  or apology. During this century our great reasoners and philosophers  began to be in motion; and, like the fumes of tobacco, which drive the  concealed and clotted insects from the interior to the extremity of  the leaves, the infectious particles of the BIBLIOMANIA set a thousand  busy brains a-thinking, and produced ten thousand capricious works,  which, over-shadowed by the majestic remains of Bacon, Locke, and  Boyle, perished for want of air, and warmth, and moisture.         [Footnote 30: \"The story is extant, and written in very       choice _French_.\" Consult Chauffepie's _Supplement to       Bayle's Dictionary_, vol. iv. p. 621. note Q. Vossius's       library was magnificent and extensive. The University of       Leyden offered not less than 36,000 florins for it. _Idem._       p. 631.]    The reign of Queen Anne was not exempt from the influence of this  disease; for during this period, Maittaire[31] began to lay the  foundation of his extensive library, and to publish some  bibliographical works which may be thought to have rather increased,  than diminished, its force. Meanwhile, Harley[32] Earl of Oxford  watched its progress with an anxious eye; and although he might have  learnt experience from the fatal examples of R. Smith,[33] and T.  Baker,[34] and the more recent ones of Thomas Rawlinson,[35]  Bridges,[36] and Collins,[37] yet he seemed resolved to brave and to  baffle it; but, like his predecessors, he was suddenly crushed within  the gripe of the demon, and fell one of the most splendid of his  victims. Even the unrivalled medical skill of Mead[38] could save  neither his friend nor himself. The Doctor survived his Lordship about  twelve years; dying of the complaint called the BIBLIOMANIA! He left  behind an illustrious character; sufficient to flatter and soothe  those who may tread in his footsteps, and fall victims to a similar  disorder.         [Footnote 31: Of MICHAEL MAITTAIRE I have given a brief       sketch in my Introduction to the _Greek and Latin Classics_,       vol. I, 148. Mr. Beloe, in the 3rd vol. of his _Anecdotes of       Literature_, p. ix., has described his merits with justice.       The principal value of Maittaire's _Annales Typographici_       consists in a great deal of curious matter detailed in the       notes; but the absence of the \"lucidus ordo\" renders the       perusal of these fatiguing and dissatisfactory. The author       brought a full and well-informed mind to the task he       undertook--but he wanted taste and precision in the       arrangement of his materials. The eye wanders over a vast       indigested mass; and information, when it is to be acquired       with excessive toil, is, comparatively, seldom acquired.       Panzer has adopted an infinitely better plan, on the model       of Orlandi; and, if his materials had been _printed_ with       the same beauty with which they appear to have been       composed, and his annals had descended to as late a period       as those of Maittaire, his work must have made us,       eventually, forget that of his predecessor. The       bibliographer is, no doubt, aware that of Maittaire's first       volume there are two editions. Why the author did not       reprint, in the second edition (1733), the facsimile of the       epigram and epistle of LASCAR prefixed to the edition of the       Anthology 1496, and the disquisition concerning the ancient       editions of Quintilian (both of which were in the first       edition of 1719), is absolutely inexplicable. Maittaire was       sharply attacked for this absurdity, in the \"Catalogus       Auctorum,\" of the \"_Annus Tertius Saecularis Inv. Art.       Topog._\" Harlem, 1741, 8vo. p. 11. \"Rara certe Librum       augendi methodus (exclaims the author)! Satis patet auctorem       hoc eo fecisse consilio, ut et primae et secundae Libri sive       editioni pretium suum constaret, et una aeque ac altera       Lectoribus necessaria esset.\"         The catalogue of Maittaire's library [1748, 2 parts, 8vo.],       which affords ample proof of the BIBLIOMANIA of its       collector, is exceedingly scarce. A good copy of it, even       unpriced, is worth a guinea: it was originally sold for 4       shillings; and was drawn up by Maittaire himself.]         [Footnote 32: In a periodical publication called \"_The       Director_,\" to which I contributed under the article of       \"_Bibliographiana_\" (and of which the printer of this work,       Mr. William Savage, is now the sole publisher), there was       rather a minute analysis of the famous library of HARLEY,       EARL OF OXFORD: a library which seems not only to have       revived, but eclipsed, the splendour of the Roman one formed       by Lucullus. The following is an abridgement of this       analysis:                                                              VOLUMES.         1.

Pamphlets--_Four Hundred Thousand_!         Mr. Gough says, these books \"filled thirteen handsome       chambers, and two long galleries.\" Osborne the bookseller       purchased them for L13,000: a sum little more than two       thirds of the price of the binding, as paid by Lord Oxford.       The bookseller was accused of injustice and parsimony; but       the low prices which he afterwards affixed to the articles,       and the tardiness of their sale, are sufficient refutations       of this charge. Osborne opened his shop for the inspection       of the books on Tuesday the 14th of February, 1744; for fear       \"of the curiosity of the spectators, before the sale,       producing disorder in the disposition of the books.\" The       dispersion of the HARLEIAN COLLECTION is a blot in the       literary annals of our country: had there then been such a       Speaker, and such a spirit in the House of Commons, as we       now possess, the volumes of Harley would have been reposing       with the MARBLES OF TOWNLEY!]         [Footnote 33: \"BIBLIOTHECA SMITHIANA: sive Catalogus       Librorum in quavis facultate insigniorum, quos in usum suum       et Bibliothecae ornamentum multo aere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#8)"],[1,"it may be attached. In _action_  turbines steam is led through fixed nozzles or steam-ways, and the  momentum of the steam is brought to bear on the surfaces of movable  bodies connected with the shaft.      THE DE LAVAL TURBINE.    In its earliest form this turbine was a modification of Hero's. The  wheel was merely a pipe bent in S form, attached at its centre to a  hollow vertical shaft supplied with steam through a stuffing-box at one  extremity. The steam blew out tangentially from the ends of the S,  causing the shaft to revolve rapidly and work the machinery (usually a  cream separator) mounted on it. This motor proved very suitable for  dairy work, but was too wasteful of steam to be useful where high power  was needed.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--The wheel and nozzles of a De Laval turbine.]    In the De Laval turbine as now constructed the steam is blown from  stationary nozzles against vanes mounted on a revolving wheel. Fig. 36  shows the nozzles and a turbine wheel. The wheel is made as a solid  disc, to the circumference of which the vanes are dovetailed separately  in a single row. Each vane is of curved section, the concave side  directed towards the nozzles, which, as will be gathered from the  \"transparent\" specimen on the right of our illustration, gradually  expand towards the mouth. This is to allow the expansion of the steam,  and a consequent gain of velocity. As it issues, each molecule strikes  against the concave face of a vane, and, while changing its direction,  is robbed of its kinetic energy, which passes to the wheel. To turn  once more to a stone-throwing comparison, it is as if a boy were pelting  the wheel with an enormous number of tiny stones. Now, escaping  high-pressure steam moves very fast indeed. To give figures, if it  enters the small end of a De Laval nozzle at 200 lbs. per square inch,  it will leave the big end at a velocity of 48 miles per _minute_--that  is, at a speed which would take it right round the world in 8-1/2 hours!  The wheel itself would not move at more than about one-third of this  speed as a maximum.[7] But even so, it may make as many as 30,000  revolutions per minute. A mechanical difficulty is now  encountered--namely, that arising from vibration. No matter how  carefully the turbine wheel may be balanced, it is practically  impossible to make its centre of gravity coincide exactly with the  central point of the shaft; in other words, the wheel will be a  bit--perhaps only a tiny fraction of an ounce--heavier on one side than  the other. This want of truth causes vibration, which, at the high speed  mentioned, would cause the shaft to knock the bearings in which it  revolves to pieces, if--and this is the point--those bearings were close  to the wheel M. de Laval mounted the wheel on a shaft long enough  between the bearings to \"whip,\" or bend a little, and the difficulty was  surmounted.    The normal speed of the turbine wheel is too high for direct driving of  some machinery, so it is reduced by means of gearing. To dynamos, pumps,  and air-fans it is often coupled direct.      THE PARSONS TURBINE.    At the grand naval review held in 1897 in honour of Queen Victoria's  diamond jubilee, one of the most noteworthy sights was the little  _Turbinia_ of 44-1/2 tons burthen, which darted about among the floating  forts at a speed much surpassing that of the fastest \"destroyer.\" Inside  the nimble little craft were engines developing 2,000 horse power,  without any of the clank and vibration which usually reigns in the  engine-room of a high-speed vessel. The _Turbinia_ was the first  turbine-driven boat, and as such, even apart from her extraordinary  pace, she attracted great attention. Since 1897 the Parsons turbine has  been installed on many ships, including several men-of-war, and it seems  probable that the time is not far distant when reciprocating engines  will be abandoned on all high-speed craft.      DESCRIPTION OF THE PARSONS TURBINE.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Section of a Parsons turbine.]    The essential parts of a Parsons turbine are:--(1) The shaft, on which  is mounted (2) the drum; (3) the cylindrical casing inside which the  drum revolves; (4) the vanes on the drum and casing; (5) the balance  pistons. Fig. 37 shows a diagrammatic turbine in section. The drum, it  will be noticed, increases its diameter in three stages, D^1, D^2,  D^3, towards the right. From end to end it is studded with little  vanes, M M, set in parallel rings small distances apart. Each vane has a  curved section (see Fig. 38), the hollow side facing towards the left.  The vanes stick out from the drum like short spokes, and their outer  ends almost touch the casing. To the latter are attached equally-spaced  rings of fixed vanes, F F, pointing inwards towards the drum, and  occupying the intervals between the rings of moving vanes. Their concave  sides also face towards the left, but, as seen in Fig. 38, their line of  curve lies the reverse way to that of M M. Steam enters the casing at A,  and at once rushes through the vanes towards the outlet at B. It meets  the first row of fixed vanes, and has its path so deflected that it  strikes the ring of moving (or drum) vanes at the most effective angle,  and pushes them round. It then has its direction changed by the ring of  F F, so that it may treat the next row of M M in a similar fashion.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Blades or vanes of a Parsons turbine.]    [Illustration: One of the low-pressure turbines of the _Carmania_, in  casing. Its size will be inferred from comparison with the man standing  near the end of the casing.]      THE EXPANSIVE ACTION OF STEAM IN A TURBINE.    On reaching the end of D^1 it enters the second, or intermediate, set  of vanes. The drum here is of a greater diameter, and the blades are  longer and set somewhat farther apart, to give a freer passage to the  now partly expanded steam, which has lost pressure but gained velocity.  The process of movement is repeated through this stage; and again in  D^3, the low-pressure drum. The steam then escapes to the condenser  through B, having by this time expanded very many times; and it is found  advisable, for reasons explained in connection with compound  steam-engines, to have a separate turbine in an independent casing for  the extreme stages of expansion.    The vanes are made of brass. In the turbines of the _Carmania_, the huge  Cunard liner, 1,115,000 vanes are used. The largest diameter of the  drums is 11 feet, and each low-pressure turbine weighs 350 tons.      BALANCING OF THRUST.    The push exerted by the steam on the blades not only turns the drum, but  presses it in the direction in which the steam flows. This end thrust is  counterbalanced by means of the \"dummy\" pistons, P^1, P^2, P^3.  Each dummy consists of a number of discs revolving between rings  projecting from the casing, the distance between discs and rings being  so small that but little steam can pass. In the high-pressure  compartment the steam pushes P^1 to the left with the same pressure as  it pushes the blades of D^1 to the right. After completing the first  stage it fills the passage C, which communicates with the second piston,  P^2, and the pressure on that piston negatives the thrust on D^2.  Similarly, the passage E causes the steam to press equally on P^3 and  the vanes of D^3. So that the bearings in which the shaft revolves  have but little thrust to take. This form of compensation is necessary  in marine as well as in stationary turbines. In the former the dummy  pistons are so proportioned that the forward thrust given by them and  the screw combined is almost equal to the thrust aft of the moving  vanes.    [Illustration: One of the turbine drums of the _Carmania_. Note the  rows of vanes. The drum is here being tested for perfect balance on two  absolutely level supports.]      ADVANTAGES OF THE MARINE TURBINE.    (1.) Absence of vibration. Reciprocating engines, however well balanced,  cause a shaking of the whole ship which is very unpleasant to  passengers. The turbine, on the other hand, being almost perfectly  balanced, runs so smoothly at the highest speeds that, if the hand be  laid on the covering, it is sometimes almost impossible to tell whether  the machinery is in motion. As a consequence of this smooth running  there is little noise in the engine-room--a pleasant contrast to the  deafening roar of reciprocating engines. (2.) Turbines occupy less room.  (3.) They are more easily tended. (4.) They require fewer repairs, since  the rubbing surfaces are very small as compared to those of  reciprocating engines. (5.) They are more economical at high speeds. It  must be remembered that a turbine is essentially meant for high speeds.  If run slowly, the steam will escape through the many passages without  doing much work.    Owing to its construction, a turbine cannot be reversed like a cylinder  engine. It therefore becomes necessary to fit special astern turbines to  one or more of the screw shafts, for use when the ship has to be stopped  or moved astern. Under ordinary conditions these turbines revolve idly  in their cases.    The highest speed ever attained on the sea was the forty-two miles per  hour of the unfortunate _Viper_, a turbine destroyer which developed  11,500 horse power, though displacing only 370 tons. This velocity would  compare favourably with that of a good many expresses on certain  railways that we could name. In the future thirty miles an hour will  certainly be attained by turbine-driven liners.      [7] Even at this speed the wheel has a circumferential velocity of  two-thirds that of a bullet shot from a Lee-Metford rifle. A vane  weighing only 250 grains (about 1/2 oz.) exerts under these conditions a  centrifugal pull of 15 cwt. on the wheel!          Chapter IV.    THE INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE.
