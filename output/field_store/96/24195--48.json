And yet it is requisite that the Trade shall succeed in  its various missions. Always.           *       *       *       *       *    The Government of the United States, you understand, will admit that  it has a Secret Service, which it strives to identify solely with the  pursuit of counterfeiters, postal thieves, and violators of the  prohibition laws. Strongly pressed, it will admit that some members of  the Secret Service work abroad, the official explanation being that  they work abroad to forestall smugglers. And at a pinch, and in  confidence, it may concede the existence of diplomatic secret agents.  But there is no such thing as the Trade. Not at all. The funds which  members of the Trade expend are derived by very devious bookkeeping  from the appropriations allotted to an otherwise honestly conducted  Department of the United States Government.    Therefore the Trade does not really exist. You might say that there is  a sort of conspiracy among certain people to do certain things. Some  of them are government officials, major and minor. Some of them are  private citizens, reputable and otherwise. One or two of them are in  jail, both here and abroad. But as far as the Government of the United  States is concerned, certain fortunate coincidences that happen now  and then are purely coincidences. And the Trade, which arranges for  them, does not exist. But it has a good many enemies.           *       *       *       *       *    The fog-horn howled dismally overhead. Mist swirled past the ship, and  an oily swell surged vaguely overside and disappeared into a gray  oblivion half a ship's length away. Bell moved on toward the stern. It  was his intention to go into the smoking-room and idle ostentatiously.  Perhaps he would enter into another argument with that Brazilian air  pilot who had so much confidence in Handley-Page wing-slots. Bell had,  in Washington, a small private plane that, he explained, had been  given him by a wealthy aunt, who hoped he would break his neck in it.  He considered that wing-slots interfered with stunting.    He had picked out the door with his eye when he espied a small figure  standing by the rail. It was Ortiz, the Argentine ex-Cabinet Minister,  staring off into the grayness, and seeming to listen with all his  ears.    Bell slowed up. The little stout man turned and nodded to him, and  then put out his hand.    \"Senor Bell,\" he said quietly, \"tell me. Do you hear airplane motors?\"    Bell listened. The drip-drip-drip of condensed mist. The shuddering of  the ship with her motors going dead slow. The tinkling, muted notes of  the piano inside the saloon. The washing and hissing of the waves  overside. That was all.    \"Why, no,\" said Bell. \"I don't. Sound travels freakishly in fog,  though. One might be quite close and we couldn't hear it. But we're a  hundred and fifty miles off the Venezuelan coast, aren't we?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ortiz turned and faced him. Bell was shocked at the expression on the  small man's face. It was drained of all blood, and its look was  ghastly. But the rather fine dark eyes were steady.    \"We are,\" agreed Ortiz, very steadily indeed, \"but I--I have received  a radiogram that some airplane should fly near this ship, and it would  amuse me to hear it.\"    Bell frowned at the fog.    \"I've done a good bit of flying,\" he observed, \"and if I were flying  out at sea right now, I'd dodge this fog bank. It would be  practically suicide to try to alight in a mist like this.\"    Ortiz regarded him carefully. It seemed to Bell that sweat was coming  out upon the other man's forehead.    \"You mean,\" he said quietly, \"that an airplane could not land?\"    \"It might try,\" said Bell with a shrug. \"But you couldn't judge your  height above the water. You might crash right into it and dive under.  Matter of fact, you probably would.\"    Ortiz's nostrils quivered a little.    \"I told them,\" he said steadily, \"I told them it was not wise to  risk....\"           *       *       *       *       *    He stopped. He looked suddenly at his hands, clenched upon the rail. A  depth of pallor even greater than his previous terrible paleness  seemed to leave even his lips without blood. He wavered on his feet,  as if he were staggering.    \"You're sick!\" said Bell sharply. Instinctively he moved forward.    The fine dark eyes regarded him oddly. And Ortiz suddenly took his  hands from the railing of the promenade deck. He looked at his fingers  detachedly. And Bell could see them writhing, opening and closing in a  horribly sensate fashion, as if they were possessed of devils and  altogether beyond the control of their owner. And he suddenly realized  that the steady, grim regard with which Ortiz looked at his hands was  exactly like the look he had seen upon a man's face once, when that  man saw a venomous snake crawling toward him and had absolutely no  weapon.    Ortiz was looking at his fingers as a man might look at cobras at the  ends of his wrists. Very calmly, but with a still, stunned horror.           *       *       *       *       *    He lifted his eyes to Bell.    \"I have no control over them,\" he said quietly. \"My hands are useless  to me, Senor Bell. I wonder if you will be good enough to assist me to  my cabin.\"    Again that deadly pallor flashed across his face. Bell caught at his  arm.    \"What is the matter?\" he demanded anxiously. \"Of course I'll help  you.\"    Ortiz smiled very faintly.    \"If any airplane arrives in time,\" he said steadily, \"something may be  done. But you have rid me of even that hope. I have been poisoned,  Senor Bell.\"    \"But the ship's doctor....\"    Ortiz, walking rather stiffly beside Bell, shrugged.    \"He can do nothing. Will you be good enough to open this door for me?  And\"--his voice was hoarse for an instant--\"assist me to put my hands  in my pockets. I cannot. But I would not like them to be seen.\"    Bill took hold of the writhing fingers. He saw sweat standing out upon  Ortiz's forehead. And the fingers closed savagely upon Bell's hands,  tearing at them. Ortiz looked at him with a ghastly supplication.    \"Now,\" he said with difficulty, \"if you will open the door, Senor  Bell....\"    Bell slid the door aside. They went in together. People were making  the best of boresome weather within, frankly yawning, most of them.  But the card-room would be full, and the smoking-room steward would be  busy.    \"My cabin is upon the next deck below,\" said Ortiz through stiff lips.  \"We--we will descend the stairs.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell went with him, his face expressionless.    \"My cabin should be unlocked,\" said Ortiz.    It was. Ortiz entered, and, with his hands still in his pockets,  indicated a steamer-trunk.    \"Please open that.\" He licked his lips. \"I--I had thought I would have  warning enough. It has not been so severe before. Right at the  top....\"    Bell flung the top back. A pair of bright and shiny handcuffs lay on  top of a dress shirt.    \"Yes,\" said Ortiz steadily. \"Put them upon my wrists, please. The  poison that has been given to me is--peculiar. I believe that one of  your compatriots has experienced its effects.\"    Bell started slightly. Ortiz eyed him steadily.    \"Precisely.\" Ortiz, with his face a gray mask of horror, spoke with a  steadiness Bell could never have accomplished. \"A poison, Senor Bell,  which has made a member of the Secret Service of the United States a  homicidal maniac. It has been given to me. I have been hoping for its  antidote, but--Quick! Senor Bell! Quick! The handcuffs!\"      CHAPTER II    The throbbing of the engines went on at an unvarying tempo. There was  the slight, almost infinitesimal tremor of their vibration. The  electric light in the cabin wavered rhythmically with its dynamo. From  the open porthole came the sound of washing water. Now and then a  disconnected sound of laughter or of speech came down from the main  saloon.    Ortiz lay upon the bed, exhausted.    \"It is perhaps humorous, Senor Bell,\" he said presently, in the same  steady voice he had used upon the deck. \"It is undoubtedly humorous  that I should call upon you. I believe that you are allied with the  Secret Service of your government.\"    Bell started to shake his head, but was still. He said nothing.    \"I am poisoned,\" said Ortiz. He tried to smile, but it was ghastly.  \"It is a poison which makes a man mad in a very horrible fashion. If I  could use my hands--and could trust them--I would undoubtedly shoot  myself. It would be entirely preferable. Instead, I hope--\"    He broke off short and listened intently. His forehead beaded.    \"Is that an airplane motor?\"    Bell went to the port and listened. The washing of waves. The  throbbing of the ship's engines. The dismal, long-drawn-out moaning  of the fog-horn. Nothing else.... Yes! A dim and distant muttering. It  drew nearer and died away again.    \"That is a plane,\" said Bell. \"Yes, It's out of hearing now.\"    Ortiz clamped his jaws together.    \"I was about to speak,\" he said steadily, \"to tell you--many things.  Which your government should know. Instead, I ask you to go to the  wireless room and have the wireless operator try to get in touch with  that plane. It is a two-motored seaplane and it has a wireless outfit.  It will answer the call M.S.T.R. Ask him to use his directional  wireless and try to guide it to the ship. It brings the antidote to  the poison which affects me.\"    Bell made for the door. Ortiz raised his head with a ghastly smile.    \"Close the door tightly,\" he said quietly. \"I--I feel as if I shall be  unpleasant.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Closing the door behind him, Bell felt rather like a man in a  nightmare. He made for the stairway, bolted for the deck, and fairly  darted up the ladder to the wireless room.    \"Ortiz sent me,\" he said to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#8)"],[1,"on  the watch for better hunters like the Falcon, they throw themselves on  him as soon as he has seized his prey. The proud bird, though much  more courageous, stronger, and more skilful than these thieves,  usually abandons the prey either because the burden embarrasses him in  the struggle, or else because he knows that he can easily find  another. These highway robbers of the air often unite to gain  possession of a prey already taken and killed, and ready to be eaten.  A handsome Falcon of the Southern States of North America, the  Caracara Eagle (_Polyborus cheriway_), frequently steals fish from the  Brown Pelicans on the coast of Texas. When the Pelicans are returning  from their expeditions with pouches filled with fish, the Caracaras  attack them until they disgorge, and then alight to devour the stolen  prey. They do not attack the outgoing birds, but only the incoming  ones, and they wait until they reach the land (so that the contents of  the pouches may not fall into the water) before pouncing on them.[25]       [25] Bendire, _Life Histories of North American Birds_,          p. 315.    Among other animals a habit has been formed from some special  circumstance. As an extreme case in this group we meet with parasites  of whom some cannot live outside a particular nest, and are even  absolutely transformed by this kind of life. But between these and  independent hunters there are an extreme number of intermediate  stages, of which it is sufficient to mention a few.[26]       [26] For a discussion of this subject, see P. van Beneden,          _Commensaux et Parasites_, Paris, 1875.    The _Fierasfer_, a little fish of the Mediterranean, installs himself  in the respiratory cavity of a Holothurian; he does not live at the  expense of his host's flesh, but contents himself with levying a tax  on the foods which enter the cavity. It is a case of commensalism of  which there are very numerous examples. Other cases may be mentioned  which are still further removed from parasitism. Among these may be  mentioned the birds who relieve large mammals of their vermin.    One of them, the Red-beaked Buffalo bird (_Buphaga erythrorhyncha_),  lives in Abyssinia. This bird is insectivorous. He has remarked that  the ruminants constitute baits for flies; therefore he never leaves  these animals, hops about on their backs and delivers them from  annoying parasites; the buffaloes, who recognise this service, allow  the bird to wander quietly over their hide. The _Buphaga_, who gives  himself up entirely to this kind of chase, is often called the  Beef-eater. He is only found in the society of flocks, of camels,  buffaloes, or oxen. He settles on the back, legs, and snouts of these  living baits. They remain passive even when he opens the skin in order  to draw out the flies' larva; they know the benefit of this little  operation. The patience of the oxen is certainly due to custom, for it  is observed that herds which are not used to this bird manifest great  terror when he prepares to alight on them, so that they even take  flight from this small aggressor.    Sometimes it is not easy to understand the advantages derived by the  animal from the conditions in which he is usually found. Thus, for  example, there is a fish, the _Polyprion cernium_, which accompanies  driftwood on which Barnacles have fixed themselves. Yet the remains of  these Crustaceans are never found in his stomach, and it is known on  the contrary that he lives exclusively on other small fish. It is  possible that these find their food in fragments of wood at the  expense of the barnacles, and that therefore the _Polyprion_ which  hunts them is always near driftwood thus garnished.    _Methods of utilising the captured game._--Frequently it is not enough  for the animal to obtain possession of his prey. Before making his  meal it is still necessary to find a method of making use of it,  either because the eatable parts are buried in a thick shell which he  is unable to break, or because he has captured a creature which rolls  itself into a ball and bristles its plumes. Here are some of the more  curious practices followed in such cases.    Sometimes it is a question of carrying off a round fruit which offers  no prominence to take hold of. The Red-headed Melanerpes (_Melanerpes  erythrocephalus_) of North America is very greedy with regard to  apples, and feeds on them as well as on cherries. It takes him a  considerable time to consume an apple, and as he is well aware of the  danger he runs by prolonging his stay in an orchard, he wishes to  carry away his booty to a safe and sheltered spot. He vigorously  plunges his open beak into the apple; the two mandibles enter  separately, and the fruit is well fixed; he detaches it and flies away  to the chosen retreat. Apes are very skilful in utilising their booty.  Cocoa-nuts are rather hard to open, but Apes do not lose any part of  them; they first tear off the fibrous envelope with their teeth, then  they enlarge the natural holes with their fingers, and drink the milk.  Finally, in order to reach the kernel they strike the nut on some hard  object exactly as Man would do. The Baboons (_Cynocephali_), whose  courage is prodigious, since they will fight in a band against a pack  of dogs or even against a leopard, are also very prudent and very  skilful. They know that courage is no use against the sting of a  venomous snake, and that the best thing is to avoid being bitten. The  scorpion, whose dart is perfidious, also inspires their distrust, but  as they like eating him they endeavour to catch him. This is not  indeed very difficult if one carefully observes his movements, and it  is possible to seize him suddenly by the tail, as I have often done,  without being stung. Apes employ this method, pull out his sting, and  crunch the now inoffensive Arachnid. They also like ants, but fear  being bitten by them; when they wish to enjoy them, they place an open  hand on an ant-hill and remain motionless until it is covered by  insects. They can then absorb them at one stroke without fear.    One would not think that an animal so well defended as the Hedgehog  need fear becoming the prey of the Fox. Rolled in a ball, bristling  with hard prickles which cruelly wound an assailant's mouth, nothing  will induce him to unroll so long as he supposes the enemy still in  the neighbourhood. It is vain to strike him or to rub him on the  earth; he remains on the armed defensive. Only one circumstance  disturbs him to the point of making him quit his prudent posture; it  is to feel himself in the water, or even simply to be moist. The fox  is acquainted with this weakness, therefore as soon as he has captured  a hedgehog he rolls him in the nearest marsh to strangle him as soon  as his head appears. It may happen that there is no puddle in the  neighbourhood suitable for this bath; it is said that in this case the  fox is not embarrassed for so small a matter, and provides from his  own body the wherewithal to moisten the hedgehog.    The combination is complicated, and approaches more nearly the methods  employed by Man when the animal makes use of a foreign body, as a tool  or as a fulcrum, to achieve his objects. A snake is very embarrassed  when he has swallowed an entire egg with the shell; he cannot digest  it in that condition, and the muscles of his stomach are not strong  enough to break it. The snake often finds himself in this condition,  and is then accustomed either to strike his body against hard objects  or to coil himself around them until he has broken the envelope of the  eggs he contains.    The Snake himself is treated in this way in South America. The Sulphur  Tyrant-bird picks up a young snake by the tail, and, flying to a  branch or stone, uses it like a flail until its life is battered  out.[27]       [27] W. H. Hudson, _Naturalist in La Plata_, p. 73.    It would be a paradox to attribute great intelligence to Batrachians;  yet certain facts are recorded which show them to be capable of  reflection. Among others the case is quoted of a green frog who  obtained possession of a small red frog, and who proposed to swallow  him. The other was naturally opposed to the realisation of this scheme  and struggled with energy. Seeing that he would not succeed, the green  frog went towards the trunk of a tree and, still holding his victim,  struck him many times vigorously against it. At last the red frog was  stunned, and could then be swallowed at leisure.    Gasteropods are not always protected by their calcareous shells any  more than tortoises are by their carapaces; for certain birds know  very well how to break them. Ravens drop snails from a height, and  thus get possession of the contents of the shell.    The most celebrated breaker of shells is the Bearded Vulture or  Lammergeyer (_Gypaeetos barbatus_). This rapacious bird is very common  in Greece, where he does not usually live on large prey. If he  sometimes carries away a fowl, it is exceptional; he prefers to live  on carrion or bones, the remains of the feasts of man or of the true  vulture. He rises very high carrying these bones in his talons and  allows them to fall on a stone, swallowing the fragments after having  sucked out the marrow. He is also greedy of tortoises, and uses the  same method to break their carapaces, eating the soft parts. These  facts have been many times observed by Brehm and other trustworthy  naturalists. It is even said that in Greece every Lammergeyer chooses  a rock on which he always comes to execute the tortoises he has  captured. It was no doubt beneath one of these birds so occupied that,  according to the story, mischance conducted AEschylus.    Neither the beak nor the claws of the Shrike or Butcher-bird (_Lanius  excubitor_) are strong enough to enable him to tear his prey easily.  When he is not too driven by hunger he installs himself in a  comfortable fashion for this carving process,"]]]
