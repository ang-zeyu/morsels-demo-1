His voice is skillful in  removing from us all anger and bitterness against the most unjust  measures, and is just such as kings require to put us to sleep again in  that old hazy slumber which is the death of nations. Every day he  odiously betrays his country, and nevertheless, despite his treason,  remains an idol for half Germany, which, dazzled by him, accepts  unresisting the poison poured out by him in his periodic pamphlets,  wrapped up and protected as he is by the seductive mantle of a great  poetic reputation. Incited by him, the princes of Germany, who have  forgotten their promises, will allow nothing free or good to be  accomplished; or if anything of the kind is accomplished in spite of  them, they will league themselves with the French to annihilate it. That  the history of our time may not be covered with eternal ignominy, it is  necessary that he should fall.    \"I have always said that if we wish to find a great and supreme remedy  for the state of abasement in which we are, none must shrink from combat  nor from suffering; and the real liberty of the German people will only  be assured when the good citizen sets himself or some other stake upon  the game, and when every true son of the country, prepared for the  struggle for justice, despises the good things of this world, and only  desires those celestial good things which death holds in charge.    \"Who then will strike this miserable hireling, this venal traitor?    \"I have long been waiting in fear, in prayer, and in tears--I who am not  born for murder--for some other to be beforehand with me, to set me  free, and suffer me to continue my way along the sweet and peaceful path  that I had chosen for myself. Well, despite my prayers and my tears, he  who should strike does not present himself; indeed, every man, like  myself, has a right to count upon some other, and everyone thus  counting, every hour's delay, but makes our state worse; far at any  moment--and how deep a shame would that be for us! Kotzebue may leave  Germany, unpunished, and go to devour in Russia the treasures for which  he has exchanged his honour, his conscience, and his German name. Who  can preserve us from this shame, if every man, if I myself, do not feel  strength to make myself the chosen instrument of God's justice?  Therefore, forward! It shall be I who will courageously rush upon him  (do not be alarmed), on him, the loathsome seducer; it shall be I who  will kill the traitor, so that his misguiding voice, being extinguished,  shall cease to lead us astray from the lessons of history and from the  Spirit of God. An irresistible and solemn duty impels me to this deed,  ever since I have recognised to what high destinies the German; nation  may attain during this century, and ever since I have come to know the  dastard and hypocrite who alone prevents it from reaching them; for me,  as for every German who seeks the public good, this desire has became a  strict and binding necessity. May I, by this national vengeance,  indicate to all upright and loyal consciences where the true danger  lies, and save our vilified and calumniated societies from the imminent  danger that threatens them! May I, in short, spread terror among the  cowardly and wicked, and courage and faith among the good! Speeches and  writings lead to nothing; only actions work.    \"I will act, therefore; and though driven violently away from my fair  dreams of the future, I am none the less full of trust in God; I even  experience a celestial joy, now that, like the Hebrews when they sought  the promised land, I see traced before me, through darkness and death,  that road at the end of which I shall have paid my debt to my country.    \"Farewell, then, faithful hearts: true, this early separation is hard;  true, your hopes, like my wishes, are disappointed; but let us be  consoled by the primary thought that we have done what the voice of our  country called upon us to do; that, you knew, is the principle according  to which I have always lived. You will doubtless say among yourselves,  'Yes, thanks to our sacrifices, he had learned to know life and to taste  the joys of earth, and he seemed: deeply to love his native country and  the humble estate to which he was called'. Alas, yes, that is true!  Under your protection, and amid your numberless sacrifices, my native  land and life had become profoundly dear to me. Yes, thanks to you, I  have penetrated into the Eden of knowledge, and have lived the free life  of thought; thanks to you, I have looked into history, and have then  returned to my own conscience to attach myself to the solid pillars of  faith in the Eternal.    \"Yes, I was to pass gently through this life as a preacher of the  gospel; yes, in my constancy to my calling I was to be sheltered from  the storms of this existence. But would that suffice to avert the danger  that threatens Germany? And you yourselves, in your infinite lave,  should you not rather push me on to risk my life for the good of all? So  many modern Greeks have fallen already to free their country from the  yoke of the Turks, and have died almost without any result and without  any hope; and yet thousands of fresh martyrs keep up their courage and  are ready to fall in their turn; and should I, then, hesitate to die?    \"That I do not recognise your love, or that your love is but a trifling  consideration with me, you will not believe. What else should impel me  to die if not my devotion to you and to Germany, and the need of proving  this devotion to my family and my country?    \"You, mother, will say, 'Why have I brought up a son whom I loved and  who loved me, for whom I have undergone a thousand cares and toils, who,  thanks to my prayers and my example, was impressionable to good  influences, and from whom, after my long and weary course, I hoped to  receive attentions like those which I have given him? Why does he now  abandon me?'    \"Oh, my kind and tender mother! Yes, you will perhaps say that; but  could not the mother of anyone else say the same, and everything go off  thus in words when there is need to act for the country? And if no one  would act, what would become of that mother of us all who is called  Germany?    \"But no; such complaints are far from you, you noble woman! I understood  your appeal once before, and at this present hour, if no one came  forward in the German cause, you yourself would urge me to the fight. I  have two brothers and two sisters before me, all noble and loyal. They  will remain to you, mother; and besides you will have for sons all the  children of Germany who love their country.    \"Every man has a destiny which he has to accomplish: mine is devoted to  the action that I am about to undertake; if I were to live another fifty  years, I could not live more happily than I have done lately. Farewell,  mother: I commend you to the protection of God; may He raise you to that  joy which misfortunes can no longer trouble! Take your grandchildren, to  whom I should so much have liked to be a loving friend, to the top of  our beautiful mountains soon. There, on that altar raised by the Lord  Himself in the midst of Germany, let them devote themselves, swearing to  take up the sword as soon as they have strength to lift it, and to lay  it down only when our brethren are all united in liberty, when all  Germans, having a liberal constitution; are great before the Lord,  powerful against their neighbours, and united among themselves.    \"May my country ever raise her happy gaze to Thee, Almighty Father! May  Thy blessing fall abundantly upon her harvests ready to be cut and her  armies ready for battle, and recognising the blessings that Thou host  showered upon us, may the German nation ever be first among nations to  rise and uphold the cause of humanity, which is Thy image upon earth!    \"Your eternally attached son, brother and friend, \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.  \"JENA, the beginning of March, 1819.\"    Sand, who, as we have said, had at first been taken to the hospital, was  removed at the end of three months to the prison at Mannheim, where the  governor, Mr. G----, had caused a room to be prepared for him. There he  remained two months longer in a state of extreme weakness: his left arm  was completely paralysed; his voice was very weak; every movement gave  him horrible pain, and thus it was not until the 11th of August--that is  to say, five months after the event that we have narrated--that he was  able to write to his family the following letter:--    \"MY VERY DEAR PARENTS:--The grand-duke's commission of inquiry informed  me yesterday that it might be possible I should have the intense joy of  a visit from you, and that I might perhaps see you here and embrace  you--you, mother, and some of my brothers and sisters.    \"Without being surprised at this fresh proof of your motherly love, I  have felt an ardent remembrance reawaken of the happy life that we spent  gently together. Joy and grief, desire and sacrifice, agitate my heart  violently, and I have had to weigh these various impulses one against  the other, and with the force of reason, in order to resume mastery of  myself and to take a decision in regard to my wishes.    \"The balance has inclined in the direction of sacrifice.    \"You know, mother, how much joy and courage a look from your eyes, daily  intercourse with you, and your pious and high-minded conversation, might  bring me during my very short time. But you also know my position, and  you are too well acquainted with the natural course of all these painful  inquiries, not to feel as I do, that such annoyance, continually  recurring, would greatly trouble the pleasure of our companionship, if  it did not indeed succeed in entirely destroying it. Then, mother, after  the long and fatiguing journey that you would be obliged to make in  order to see me, think of the terrible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#8)"],[1,"his message; he returned, however, in a few moments, and told Grandier,  in the presence of Dupuis, Buron, and a certain sieur Labrasse, that the  bishop advised him to take his case to the royal judges, and that he  earnestly hoped he would obtain justice from them. Grandier perceived  that the bishop had been warned against him, and felt that he was  becoming more and more entangled in the net of conspiracy around him;  but he was not a man to flinch before any danger. He therefore returned  immediately to Loudun, and went once more to the bailiff, to whom he  related all that had happened at Dissay; he then, a second time, made a  formal complaint as to the slanders circulated with regard to him, and  begged the magistrates to have recourse to the king's courts in the  business. He also said that he desired to be placed under the protection  of the king and his justice, as the accusations made against him were  aimed at his honour and his life. The bailiff hastened to make out a  certificate of Urbain's protest, which forbade at the same time the  repetition of the slanders or the infliction on Urbain of any injury.    Thanks to this document, a change of parts took place: Mignon, the  accuser, became the accused. Feeling that he had powerful support behind  him, he had the audacity to appear before the bailiff the same day. He  said that he did not acknowledge his jurisdiction, as in what concerned  Grandier and himself, they being both priests, they could only be judged  by their bishop; he nevertheless protested against the complaint lodged  by Grandier, which characterised him as a slanderer, and declared that  he was ready to give himself up as a prisoner, in order to show everyone  that he did not fear the result of any inquiry. Furthermore, he had  taken an oath on the sacred elements the day before, in the presence of  his parishioners who had come to mass, that in all he had hitherto done  he had been moved, not by hatred of Grandier, but by love of the truth,  and by his desire for the triumph of the Catholic faith; and he insisted  that the bailiff should give him a certificate of his declaration, and  served notice of the same on Grandier that very day.          CHAPTER V      Since October 13th, the day on which the demons had been expelled, life  at the convent seemed to have returned to its usual quiet; but Grandier  did not let himself be lulled to sleep by the calm: he knew those with  whom he was contending too well to imagine for an instant that he would  hear no more of them; and when the bailiff expressed pleasure at this  interval of repose, Grandier said that it would not last long, as the  nuns were only conning new parts, in order to carry on the drama in a  more effective manner than ever. And in fact, on November 22nd, Rene  Mannouri, surgeon to the convent, was sent to one of his colleagues,  named Gaspard Joubert, to beg him to come, bringing some of the  physicians of the town with him, to visit the two sisters, who were  again tormented by evil spirits. Mannouri, however, had gone to the  wrong man, for Joubert had a frank and loyal character, and hated  everything that was underhand. Being determined to take no part in the  business, except in a public and judicial manner, he applied at once to  the bailiff to know if it was by his orders that he was called in. The  bailiff said it was not, and summoned Mannouri before him to ask him by  whose authority he had sent for Joubert. Mannouri declared that the  'touriere' had run in a fright to his house, saying that the nuns had  never been worse possessed than now, and that the director, Mignon,  begged him to come at once to the convent, bringing with him all the  doctors he could find.    The bailiff, seeing that fresh plots against Grandier were being formed,  sent for him and warned him that Barre had come over from Chinon the day  before, and had resumed his exorcisms at the convent, adding that it was  currently reported in the town that the mother superior and Sister  Claire were again tormented by devils. The news neither astonished nor  discouraged Grandier, who replied, with his usual smile of disdain, that  it was evident his enemies were hatching new plots against him, and that  as he had instituted proceedings against them for the former ones, he  would take the same course with regard to these. At the same time,  knowing how impartial the bailiff was, he begged him to accompany the  doctors and officials to the convent, and to be present at the  exorcisms, and should any sign of real possession manifest itself, to  sequester the afflicted nuns at once, and cause them to be examined by  other persons than Mignon and Barre, whom he had such good cause to  distrust.    The bailiff wrote to the king's attorney, who, notwithstanding his bias  against Grandier, was forced to see that the conclusions arrived at were  correct, and having certified this in writing, he at once sent his clerk  to the convent to inquire if the superior were still possessed. In case  of an affirmative reply being given, the clerk had instructions to warn  Mignon and Barre that they were not to undertake exorcisms unless in  presence of the bailiff and of such officials and doctors as he might  choose to bring with him, and that they would disobey at their peril; he  was also to tell them that Grandier's demands to have the nuns  sequestered and other exorcists called in were granted.    Mignon and Barre listened while the clerk read his instructions, and  then said they refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the bailiff in  this case; that they had been summoned by the mother superior and Sister  Claire when their strange illness returned, an illness which they were  convinced was nothing else than possession by evil spirits; that they  had hitherto carried out their exorcisms under the authority of a  commission given them by the Bishop of Poitiers; and as the time for  which they had permission had not yet expired; they would continue to  exorcise as often as might be necessary. They had, however, given notice  to the worthy prelate of what was going on, in order that he might  either come himself or send other exorcists as best suited him, so that  a valid opinion as to the reality, of the possession might be procured,  for up to the present the worldly and unbelieving had taken upon  themselves to declare in an off-hand manner that the whole affair was a  mixture of fraud and delusion, in contempt of the glory of God and the  Catholic religion. As to the rest of the message, they would not, in any  way prevent the bailiff and the other officials, with as many medical  men as they chose to bring, from seeing the nuns, at least until they  heard from the bishop, from whom they expected a letter next day. But it  was for the nuns themselves to say whether it was convenient for them to  receive visitors; as far as concerned themselves, they desired to renew  their protest, and declared they could not accept the bailiff as their  judge, and did not think that it could be legal for them to refuse to  obey a command from their ecclesiastical superiors, whether with  relation to exorcism or any other thing of which the ecclesiastical  courts properly took cognisance. The clerk brought this answer to the  bailiff, and he, thinking it was better to wait for the arrival of the  bishop or of fresh orders from him, put off his visit to the convent  until the next day. But the next day came without anything being heard  of the prelate himself or of a messenger from him.    Early in the morning the bailiff went to the convent, but was not  admitted; he then waited patiently until noon, and seeing that no news  had arrived from Dissay, and that the convent gates were still closed  against him, he granted a second petition of Grandier's, to the effect  that Byre and Mignon should be prohibited from questioning the superior  and the other nuns in a manner tending to blacken the character of the  petitioner or any other person. Notice of this prohibition was served  the same day on Barre and on one nun chosen to represent the community.  Barre did not pay the slightest attention to this notice, but kept on  asserting that the bailiff had no right to prevent his obeying the  commands of his bishop, and declaring that henceforward he would perform  all exorcisms solely under ecclesiastical sanction, without any  reference to lay persons, whose unbelief and impatience impaired the  solemnity with which such rites should be conducted.    The best part of the day having gone over without any sign of either  bishop or messenger, Grandier presented a new petition to the bailiff.  The bailiff at once summoned all the officers of the bailiwick and the  attorneys of the king, in order to lay it before them; but the king's  attorneys refused to consider the matter, declaring upon their honour  that although they did not accuse Grandier of being the cause, yet they  believed that the nuns were veritably possessed, being convinced by the  testimony of the devout ecclesiastics in whose presence the evil spirits  had come out. This was only the ostensible reason for their refusal, the  real one being that the advocate was a relation of Mignon's, and the  attorney a son-in-law of Trinquant's, to whose office he had succeeded.  Thus Grandier, against whom were all the ecclesiastical judges, began to  feel as if he were condemned beforehand by the judges of the royal  courts, for he knew how very short was the interval between the  recognition of the possession as a fact and the recognition of himself  as its author.    Nevertheless, in spite of the formal declarations of the king's advocate  and attorney, the bailiff ordered the superior and the lay sister to be  removed to houses in town, each to be accompanied by a nun as companion.  During their absence from the convent they were to be looked after by  exorcists, by women of high character and position, as well as "]]]
