[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26076"],[0,"Birds from Coahuila, Mexico (#8)"],[1,"State.    **_Micrathene whitneyi_ (Cooper).--Miller (1955a:164) heard the Elf Owl  at close range in oaks at 5000 feet in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra  del Carmen on April 24.    **_Speotyto cunicularia hypugaea_ (Bonaparte).--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: [Female] 32043 from 3 mi. S, 9 mi. E Cuatro Cienegas, 2250  ft., June 30, 1952; [Male] 32653 from 6 mi. W San Antonio de las  Alazanas, July 5, 1955; and [Male] 31602 from 14 mi. W San Antonio de  las Alazanas, 6500 ft., January 7, 1954.    Although there are no records in Coahuila of specimens of Burrowing  Owls north of 3 mi. S and 9 mi. E Cuatro Cienegas, this owl probably  occurs in the northern section of the State. The records of Burrowing  Owls from the southern part of Brewster County, Texas (Van Tyne and  Sutton, 1937:38), suggest such occurrence. No. 31602 was shot in a  prairie dog colony; No. 32043 was captured in a steel trap. Baker saw  Burrowing Owls 7 mi. S and 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 feet, on June 25,  1952.    *_Caprimulgus vociferus arizonae_ (Brewster).--_Specimens examined:_  total 4: [Male] 31449 and [Female] 31450 from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi.  S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May 12 and 15, 1954, weights, 48 and 42 gms.;  and [Male] [Male] 31028-31029 from 2 mi. N, 18 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7250  ft., April 3, 1952.    The Whip-poor-will occurs between 5000 feet and 9000 feet in Coahuila.  Miller (1955a:164) reported _C. v. arizonae_ in the Sierra del Carmen.  Ridgway (1914:521) stated that _Antrostomus vociferus macromystax_  (=_C. v. arizonae_) occurs in the southeastern sector of Coahuila at  Sierra Guadalupe. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:190) reported the  Whip-poor-will \"near the summit of Diamante Pass\"; because of its size  (wing, 170 mm.; tail, 135 mm.) this Whip-poor-will from Diamante Pass  seems to represent the subspecies _arizonae_. Dickerman saw four  Whip-poor-wills 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6000 feet, on April 4, 1954. The sizes  of the testes of Nos. 31449, 31028, and 31029 (13, 12, and 13 mm. long)  and an egg taken from No. 31450 indicate breeding by this species in  the State.    *_Phalaenoptilus nuttallii nuttallii_ (Audubon).--_Specimens examined:_  total 6: [Male] 31032 from 37 mi. S, 21 mi. E Boquillas, 4100 ft.,  March 12, 1952; [Male] 31446 and [Female] 31447 from Sierra del Pino  (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), 6200 ft., May 13, 1954; [Male] [Male]  32048-32049 from 2 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nava, June 16, 1952; and [Female]  31033 from 4 mi. W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft., March 26, 1952.    Miller (1955a:164) found the Poor-will common along the rocky canyon  walls up to 5000 feet in the Sierra del Carmen. Ridgway (1914:550)  recorded the Poor-will at Sabinas on May 21 and at Saltillo on May 6.  Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:39) stated that _P. n. nuttallii_ was not  common in the Big Bend Country of Texas; this probably is true for  northwestern Coahuila as well. The specimens from the Sierra del Pino,  collected by Dickerman in a pine-oak association at 6200 feet, were  taken near the upper limit of their range. Findley saw Poor-wills 2 mi.  W Jimenez, 850 feet, on June 19, 1952; 2 mi. S and 11 mi. E Nava, 810  feet, on June 15, 1952; and 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on  June 22, 1952. Dickerman noted Poor-wills 16 mi. E and 18 mi. N Ocampo  on May 7, 1954, and 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6000 feet, on April 4, 1954.    The size of the testes (9x5 mm.) of No. 31446 and an enlarged oviduct  and an ovum (4 mm. in diameter) of No. 31447 indicate breeding by the  Poor-will in Coahuila.    **_Chordeiles minor howelli_ Oberholser.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31443, from 3 mi. N, 4 mi. E San Francisco (=25 mi. N Ocampo),  4850 ft., May 16, 1954.    Van Hoose (1955:302) wrote that nighthawks were heard and seen  frequently 3 mi. N and 4 mi. E San Francisco. Blake (1953:227) said  that the Common Nighthawk breeds in Sonora, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, and  Durango; the size of the testes (7x4.5 mm.) of No. 31443 indicates the  possibility of breeding by this species in the State.    *_Chordeiles acutipennis texensis_ Lawrence.--_Specimens examined:_  total 4: [Male] 32044 and [Female] 32045 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft.,  June 20, 1952; [Female] 31442 from 5 mi. N, 13 mi. E Ocampo, May 6,  1954; and [Male] 32046 from 2 mi. N, 1 mi. W Ocampo, 4050 ft., July 6,  1952.    Specimens of the Lesser Nighthawk, subspecies _C. a. texensis_, have  been recorded in the literature from representative localities  throughout most of Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:190-191)  obtained, on April 18, at \"a small pond at the edge of Saltillo,\" one  male that was exceedingly fat; they (_loc. cit._) suggested that their  specimen was a migrant. Goldman (1951:377, 389) stated that _C. a.  texensis_ occupied the Lower and Upper Sonoran and Upper Austral  life-zones of Coahuila. Dickerman saw Lesser Nighthawks at San Marcos  (=20 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas) on May 4, 1954. Van Tyne and Sutton  (1937:41) reported that the Lesser Nighthawk was common throughout the  lower parts of the Big Bend in Texas. This is probably true for  northwestern Coahuila as well.    The presence of an egg in the oviduct of No. 32045 and the dates (May  6, June 20, and July 6) on which Nos. 31442, and 32044-32046 were  obtained indicate breeding by this species in Coahuila.    **_Aeronautes saxatalis saxatalis_ (Woodhouse).--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Male] 31672, from Pico de Jimulco, 5600 ft., April 5, 1953,  weight, 35 gms.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191) found the White-throated Swift to be  common at \"the summit of Diamante Pass and on the nearby ridges.\"  Miller (1955a:164) saw the species from 4800 feet up to the crest of  the Sierra del Carmen. Several White-throated Swifts were seen flying  overhead at Pico de Jimulco on April 5.    No specimens of _A. s. sclateri_ from Mexico are known. Miller  (1955a:165) listed one specimen with dimensions (wing, 145 mm.) that  approaches _sclateri_. The measurements of No. 31672 (wing, 143 mm.;  tail, 58 mm.) also approach the dimensions of specimens of _sclateri_  but are best referred to _A. s. saxatalis_.    **_Calothorax lucifer_ (Swainson).--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191)  obtained a male Lucifer Hummingbird at the Chorro del Agua on April 19.  Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:43) reported a male from the Rio Grande (=3  mi. W Boquillas, Texas).    _Archilochus colubris_ (Linnaeus).--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1950:180) remarked that the Ruby-throated Hummingbird is a moderately  common migrant, wintering from sea level to 9350 feet throughout  Mexico, except in a few states. The only published record of a specimen  of this hummer in the State is of a male taken on April 22 in a small  arroyo twenty miles west of Saltillo (Burleigh and Lowery, 1942:191).    *_Archilochus alexandri_ (Bourcier and Mulsant).--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] 31035 from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell  County, Texas, in Coahuila), 600 ft., March 18, 1952; and [Male] 32052  from 2 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nava, 810 ft., June 16, 1952.    Miller (1955a:165) stated the Black-chinned Hummingbird was common in  the desert area at the base of the mountains of the Sierra del Carmen,  and that Marsh, on July 25, obtained this hummingbird \"near Piedra  Blanca (Conejo).\" Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191) obtained a female in  an arroyo about twenty miles west of Saltillo on April 22.    **_Selasphorus platycercus platycercus_ (Swainson).--_Specimens  examined:_ total 2: [Male] 31583 from 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6500 ft., April  4, 1954; and [Female] 32673 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas,  9950 ft., July 6, 1955.    Miller (1955a:165) indicated that the Broad-tailed Hummingbird was  fairly common in the Sierra del Carmen. According to Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:191) this species is not uncommon in the pine woods  bordering the summit of Diamante Pass; they saw the bird between 4900  and 10,000 feet.    *_Eugenes fulgens fulgens_ Boucard.--Miller (1955a:165) obtained a male  Rivoli's Hummingbird on Loomis Peak, 8800 feet, on April 11 in the  Sierra del Carmen.    **_Lampornis clemenciae clemenciae_ (Lesson).--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] 31036 from 26 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7050 ft., April 5,  1952; and [Female] 32668 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas,  9950 ft., July 6, 1955.    The Blue-throated Hummingbird occurs between 5000 and 9950 feet in  Coahuila. Miller (1955a:165) remarked that it was found in canyon  bottoms, \"whether at 7500 feet among the rocky slopes, oaks, and white  pines ... or at 5000 feet in the madrone, maples, elms, and  basswoods....\" No. 32668, was obtained in a Douglas fir-pine-aspen  association at 9950 feet.    [_Amazilia yucatanensis chalconota_ Oberholser.--The Buff-bellied  Hummingbird seems to be uncommon in Coahuila. Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1950:172) and the AOU Check-list Committee (1957:306) stated  that this hummingbird occurs in Coahuila.]    _Megaceryle alcyon alcyon_ (Linnaeus).--Miller (1955a:165) saw a Belted  Kingfisher at Carboneras Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:15) stated that one specimen of _M.  a. alcyon_ was obtained in Coahuila on November 14.    **_Chloroceryle americana hachisukai_ (Laubmann).--_Specimens  examined:_ total 2: [Female] 32053 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez,  June 19, 1952; and [Female] 31038 from 8 mi. N, 4 mi. W Muzquiz, 1800  ft., March 31, 1952.    The Green Kingfisher has been recorded in Coahuila as far south as 8  mi. N and 4 mi. W Muzquiz. The forehead of No. 31038, when compared  with typical representatives of _C. a. hachisukai_, is not extensively  streaked with white, nor are all the coverts conspicuously spotted with  white, yet it clearly has more extensive white markings than typical  representatives of _C. a. septentrionalis_. This specimen from 8 mi. N  and 4 mi. W Muzquiz probably is intermediate between _hachisukai_ and  _septentrionalis_. Miller (1955a:165) stated that Marsh took a specimen  at Tanque de"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26113"],[0,"Handbook of Wool Knitting and Crochet (#8)"],[1,"ger, draw it back, catching the  thread, and pull this through the loop on the needle), forming a new  stitch or loop, take up the thread and draw through this, and so  continue until the chain is of the length required, tightening each loop  as drawn through, so that all will be of uniform size and smoothness.  After a little practise one does this without thought. When  abbreviations are used, that for chain is ch.    THE SLIP-STITCH is properly a close joining stitch: Drop the stitch on  the needle, insert hook through the stitch of work to which you wish to  join, take up the dropped stitch and pull through, thus making a close  fastening. This stitch is sometimes used to \"slip\" along certain  portions of the work, from one to another point, but single crochet is  more often employed for this. The abbreviation is sl-st.    [Illustration: Figure 2. Single Crochet]    SINGLE CROCHET (Figure 2, frequently called slip-stitch, and sometimes  mitten-stitch) is made thus: Having a stitch on needle, insert hook in  work, take up the thread and draw it through the work and the stitch on  the needle at the same time. The abbreviation is s c.    [Illustration: Figure 3. Double Crochet]    DOUBLE CROCHET. (Figure 3). Having a stitch on needle, insert hook in  work, take up thread and draw through, giving you two stitches on the  needle; take up thread and draw through the two stitches. The  abbreviation is d c. There are many variations of the double-crochet  stitch; the slipper-stitch, or ribbed stitch, is formed by taking up the  back horizontal loop or vein of each stitch in preceding row. A quite  different effect is given when the hook is inserted under both loops.    [Illustration: Figure 4. Treble Crochet]    TREBLE CROCHET. (Figure 4.) Having a stitch on the needle, take up the  thread as if to make a stitch, insert hook in work, take up thread and  draw through, making three stitches or loops on the needle; * take up  thread and draw through two, again and draw through two. The  abbreviation of treble crochet, is t c. It will be noted that the single  crochet has one \"draw,\" the double two, and the treble three, from which  these stitches take their names.    [Illustration: Figure 5. Half-Treble Crochet]    HALF-TREBLE OR SHORT-TREBLE CROCHET. Like treble to *; then take up  thread and draw through all three stitches at once.    [Illustration: Figure 6. Double-Treble Crochet]    DOUBLE-TREBLE CROCHET. (Figure 6.) Having a stitch on the needle, take  up the thread twice, or put it twice over the needle, insert hook in  work, take up thread and draw through, making four stitches to be worked  off; (take up thread and draw through two) three times. The abbreviation  of double-treble crochet is d t c.    [Illustration: Figure 7. Triple-Treble Crochet]    TRIPLE-TREBLE CROCHET. (Figure 7.) Take up thread three times, insert  hook in work, take up thread and draw through, making five stitches on  needle; work these off two at a time, as in double treble. The  abbreviation is t t c.    One sometimes has occasion to use other extra-long stitches, such as  quadruple crochet (over four times before insertion of hook in work),  quintuple crochet (over five times), and so on, which are worked off two  at a time, exactly as in treble or double treble. In turning, one  chain-stitch corresponds to a double, two chain-stitches to a half or  short treble, three chain to a treble, four to a double treble, five to  a triple treble, and so on, adding one chain for each extra \"draw.\"    PARENTHESES () AND ASTERISKS OR STARS * * are used to prevent the  necessity of repetition and save space. They indicate repeats of like  directions. Thus: (Chain 3, miss 3, 1 treble in next) three times is  equivalent to chain 3, miss 3, 1 treble in next, chain 3, miss 3, 1  treble in next, chain 3, miss 3, 1 treble in next; or to * chain 3, miss  3, 1 treble in next, repeat from * twice.    The worker should be careful in the selection of a hook. It should be  well made and smooth, and of a size to carry the wool smoothly, without  catching in and roughening it. If too large, on the other hand, the work  is apt to be sleazy. Needles that have been used for some time work more  easily than new ones. If all makes of crochet-needles were numbered in  the same way the size might be easily designated; but it happens that no  two manufacturers use like numbers for the same sizes, hence the rule  given is the best that can be.          Crocheted Jacket      [Illustration: Crochet Jacket]    One color or two may be used for making this pretty jacket, which is  extremely modish, and very comfortable for the cool days and evenings  sure to be experienced during summer outings. Six skeins of fourfold  Germantown will be sufficient; or four skeins of one color for the body  and two of white for the border, if made in two colors.    Make a chain of 54 stitches, turn.    1. Miss 3, a double in next, * chain 1, miss 1, 1 double in next; repeat  from * across, making 26 doubles; turn.    2. Chain 2, a double under 1 chain, * chain 1, a double under next 1  chain; repeat across, turn.    Repeat 2d row until you have completed a strip 22 inches long, for the  back, bringing the work to the shoulder.    Now work back and forth for one shoulder and front, repeating 2d row  until you have made 9 doubles; turn, chain 2, and repeat until you have  made 4 rows.    In the next row widen by making 2 doubles, 1 chain between, in center of  row, finishing row as usual; widen in the center of every 8th row until  you have 15 doubles in the row, then continue without widening until the  front is of the same length as the back.    Leave 8 doubles for back of neck and on the remaining 9 doubles work the  other front to correspond.    For the border: Commence (with the border-color, if two colors are used)  at corner of left front, make a treble under 1 chain (chain 3 for 1st  treble), * chain 1, a treble under next 1 chain; repeat from * all  around, putting 2 trebles with 1 chain between in same stitch at  corners, and on the shoulders at the neck to shape the collar.    Make another row in the same way, then work in seed-stitch as you did  the body of the jacket (a double under 1 chain, chain 1) for 8 rows,  widening the same stitches at corners each time.    Fold the garment at the shoulders, bringing fronts and back together.  Commencing in 10th chain from bottom of front and back, work in the  usual way for 25 stitches, a double under each chain. Work from underarm  around the armscye until the sleeve is 12 inches in length, or as long  as desired, then make the 2 rows of spaces, in treble crochet, as before  and finish with 7 rows of seed-stitch, same as body of jacket.    For the picot edge: Two doubles in 2 stitches, chain 3 for a picot;  repeat.    The stitch given is very simple and pretty, but any other fancy stitch  may be used that is liked. Among others may be named Lancaster-stitch,  made as follows: Having a chain of an even number of stitches, turn.    1. Miss 1st stitch, a double in each remaining stitch, turn.    2. Chain 3, wool over, draw a loop through 1st stitch, over, draw a loop  through next stitch, over, draw a loop through same stitch, over, draw a  loop through next stitch, over, draw through all the loops on needle, *  chain 4, a double in 1st stitch of the chain just made, which closes or  joins the cluster of loops, over, draw a loop through same stitch with  last loop of preceding cluster, over, draw a loop through next stitch,  over, draw a loop through same stitch, over, draw a loop through next  stitch, over, draw through all the loops on needle, and repeat from *;  turn.    3. A double in 1st space, double around the thread between 4 chain and  cluster; repeat, ending with a double in top of 3 chain with which last  row started. Repeat 2d and 3d rows for the pattern.    The bird's-eye-stitch is simple and pleasing: Having a chain of desired  length, turn.    1. Miss 1, a double in each stitch of chain, turn.    2. A double in double, taking front loop of stitch in last row, a double  in next double, taking back loop; repeat to end, and repeat 2d row.    Still another pretty stitch, easily adjusted to any garment, is as  follows: Chain a number of stitches divisible by 3, turn.    1. Miss 1, a double in each remaining stitch of chain, turn.    2. Chain 1, a double in each double of last row, turn.    3. Chain 1, a double in each of 2 doubles, * wool over, insert hook in  3d stitch of 1st row, take up wool and draw through, (over, draw through  2 stitches) twice, miss 1, a double in each of next 2 doubles; repeat  from * to end of row, turn.    4. Same as 2d row.    5. Chain 1, a double in each of 1st 2 doubles, * wool over and make a  treble as before, inserting the hook under the treble of 3d row, miss 1,  a double in each of 2 stitches; repeat from * to end, turn. Repeat 4th  and 5th rows.    And another still: Make a chain of length required, turn.    1. Miss 3, a treble in next stitch, * miss 1, 2 trebles in next stitch,  repeat to end of row, turn.    2. Chain 3, 2 trebles between each group of 2 trebles in last row;  repeat. Repeat 2d row.          Tam-o'-Shanter in Double Crochet      [Illustration: Tam-o'-Shanter in Double Crochet]    For the model were used one skein of electric-blue knitting-worsted and  a ball of gray Angora wool, with a hook large enough to carry the yarn  easily.    Make a chain of 3 stitches, join.    1. Seven doubles in ring.    2. Two doubles in each double, taking both veins of stitch.    3. A double in double, 2 in next; repeat.    4. A double in each of 2 doubles, 2 in next; repeat.    5. A double in each of 3 doubles, 2 in next; repeat.    Continue in this way, adding 1 double between widenings each row, until  you have 30 doubles in each section--between widenings--or more, if a  larger crown is desired.    33. A double in each of 7 doubles, miss 1; repeat.    34. A double in each of 6 doubles, miss 1; "]]]
