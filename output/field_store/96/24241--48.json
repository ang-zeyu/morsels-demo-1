But the girl looked at it with  some disdain, and said--    \"Dear neighbour, I can give you something much better than that cotton  rag.\"  And she tripped up the shop and came back presently, and as she  passed the boy whispered something in his ear, and he nodded and got up  and went out.  The girl held up in her finger and thumb a red morocco  bag, gaily embroidered, and said, \"There, I have chosen one for you, and  you are to have it: it is pretty, and will hold a lot.\"    Therewith she fell to cramming it with the tobacco, and laid it down by  me and said, \"Now for the pipe: that also you must let me choose for you;  there are three pretty ones just come in.\"    She disappeared again, and came back with a big-bowled pipe in her hand,  carved out of some hard wood very elaborately, and mounted in gold  sprinkled with little gems.  It was, in short, as pretty and gay a toy as  I had ever seen; something like the best kind of Japanese work, but  better.    \"Dear me!\" said I, when I set eyes on it, \"this is altogether too grand  for me, or for anybody but the Emperor of the World.  Besides, I shall  lose it: I always lose my pipes.\"    The child seemed rather dashed, and said, \"Don't you like it, neighbour?\"    \"O yes,\" I said, \"of course I like it.\"    \"Well, then, take it,\" said she, \"and don't trouble about losing it.  What  will it matter if you do?  Somebody is sure to find it, and he will use  it, and you can get another.\"    I took it out of her hand to look at it, and while I did so, forgot my  caution, and said, \"But however am I to pay for such a thing as this?\"    Dick laid his hand on my shoulder as I spoke, and turning I met his eyes  with a comical expression in them, which warned me against another  exhibition of extinct commercial morality; so I reddened and held my  tongue, while the girl simply looked at me with the deepest gravity, as  if I were a foreigner blundering in my speech, for she clearly didn't  understand me a bit.    \"Thank you so very much,\" I said at last, effusively, as I put the pipe  in my pocket, not without a qualm of doubt as to whether I shouldn't find  myself before a magistrate presently.    \"O, you are so very welcome,\" said the little lass, with an affectation  of grown-up manners at their best which was very quaint.  \"It is such a  pleasure to serve dear old gentlemen like you; especially when one can  see at once that you have come from far over sea.\"    \"Yes, my dear,\" quoth I, \"I have been a great traveller.\"    As I told this lie from pure politeness, in came the lad again, with a  tray in his hands, on which I saw a long flask and two beautiful glasses.  \"Neighbours,\" said the girl (who did all the talking, her brother being  very shy, clearly) \"please to drink a glass to us before you go, since we  do not have guests like this every day.\"    Therewith the boy put the tray on the counter and solemnly poured out a  straw-coloured wine into the long bowls.  Nothing loth, I drank, for I  was thirsty with the hot day; and thinks I, I am yet in the world, and  the grapes of the Rhine have not yet lost their flavour; for if ever I  drank good Steinberg, I drank it that morning; and I made a mental note  to ask Dick how they managed to make fine wine when there were no longer  labourers compelled to drink rot-gut instead of the fine wine which they  themselves made.    \"Don't you drink a glass to us, dear little neighbours?\" said I.    \"I don't drink wine,\" said the lass; \"I like lemonade better: but I wish  your health!\"    \"And I like ginger-beer better,\" said the little lad.    Well, well, thought I, neither have children's tastes changed much.  And  therewith we gave them good day and went out of the booth.    To my disappointment, like a change in a dream, a tall old man was  holding our horse instead of the beautiful woman.  He explained to us  that the maiden could not wait, and that he had taken her place; and he  winked at us and laughed when he saw how our faces fell, so that we had  nothing for it but to laugh also--    \"Where are you going?\" said he to Dick.    \"To Bloomsbury,\" said Dick.    \"If you two don't want to be alone, I'll come with you,\" said the old  man.    \"All right,\" said Dick, \"tell me when you want to get down and I'll stop  for you.  Let's get on.\"    So we got under way again; and I asked if children generally waited on  people in the markets.  \"Often enough,\" said he, \"when it isn't a matter  of dealing with heavy weights, but by no means always.  The children like  to amuse themselves with it, and it is good for them, because they handle  a lot of diverse wares and get to learn about them, how they are made,  and where they come from, and so on.  Besides, it is such very easy work  that anybody can do it.  It is said that in the early days of our epoch  there were a good many people who were hereditarily afflicted with a  disease called Idleness, because they were the direct descendants of  those who in the bad times used to force other people to work for  them--the people, you know, who are called slave-holders or employers of  labour in the history books.  Well, these Idleness-stricken people used  to serve booths _all_ their time, because they were fit for so little.  Indeed, I believe that at one time they were actually _compelled_ to do  some such work, because they, especially the women, got so ugly and  produced such ugly children if their disease was not treated sharply,  that the neighbours couldn't stand it.  However, I'm happy to say that  all that is gone by now; the disease is either extinct, or exists in such  a mild form that a short course of aperient medicine carries it off.  It  is sometimes called the Blue-devils now, or the Mulleygrubs.  Queer  names, ain't they?\"    \"Yes,\" said I, pondering much.  But the old man broke in:    \"Yes, all that is true, neighbour; and I have seen some of those poor  women grown old.  But my father used to know some of them when they were  young; and he said that they were as little like young women as might be:  they had hands like bunches of skewers, and wretched little arms like  sticks; and waists like hour-glasses, and thin lips and peaked noses and  pale cheeks; and they were always pretending to be offended at anything  you said or did to them.  No wonder they bore ugly children, for no one  except men like them could be in love with them--poor things!\"    He stopped, and seemed to be musing on his past life, and then said:    \"And do you know, neighbours, that once on a time people were still  anxious about that disease of Idleness: at one time we gave ourselves a  great deal of trouble in trying to cure people of it.  Have you not read  any of the medical books on the subject?\"    \"No,\" said I; for the old man was speaking to me.    \"Well,\" said he, \"it was thought at the time that it was the survival of  the old mediaeval disease of leprosy: it seems it was very catching, for  many of the people afflicted by it were much secluded, and were waited  upon by a special class of diseased persons queerly dressed up, so that  they might be known.  They wore amongst other garments, breeches made of  worsted velvet, that stuff which used to be called plush some years ago.\"    All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made  the old man talk more.  But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient  history: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for  his great-grandfather.  So he burst out laughing at last, and said:  \"Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it.  Fancy people not liking to  work!--it's too ridiculous.  Why, even you like to work, old  fellow--sometimes,\" said he, affectionately patting the old horse with  the whip.  \"What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!\"    And he laughed out again most boisterously; rather too much so, I  thought, for his usual good manners; and I laughed with him for company's  sake, but from the teeth outward only; for _I_ saw nothing funny in  people not liking to work, as you may well imagine.          CHAPTER VII: TRAFALGAR SQUARE      And now again I was busy looking about me, for we were quite clear of  Piccadilly Market, and were in a region of elegantly-built much  ornamented houses, which I should have called villas if they had been  ugly and pretentious, which was very far from being the case.  Each house  stood in a garden carefully cultivated, and running over with flowers.  The blackbirds were singing their best amidst the garden-trees, which,  except for a bay here and there, and occasional groups of limes, seemed  to be all fruit-trees: there were a great many cherry-trees, now all  laden with fruit; and several times as we passed by a garden we were  offered baskets of fine fruit by children and young girls.  Amidst all  these gardens and houses it was of course impossible to trace the sites  of the old streets: but it seemed to me that the main roadways were the  same as of old.    We came presently into a large open space, sloping somewhat toward the  south, the sunny site of which had been taken advantage of for planting  an orchard, mainly, as I could see, of apricot-trees, in the midst of  which was a pretty gay little structure of wood, painted and gilded, that  looked like a refreshment-stall.  From the southern side of the said  orchard ran a long road, chequered over with the shadow of tall old pear  trees, at the end of which showed the high tower of the Parliament House,  or Dung Market.    A strange sensation came over me; I shut my eyes to keep out the sight of  the sun glittering on this fair abode of gardens, and for a moment there  passed before them a phantasmagoria of another day.  A great space  surrounded by tall ugly houses, with an ugly church at the corner and a  nondescript ugly cupolaed building at my back; the roadway"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32664"],[0,"Black Amazon of Mars (#8)"],[1,"her mount. Bending low, she took up the axe from where  it had fallen, and faced her warriors, who were as dazed as Stark.    \"I have led you well,\" she said. \"I have taken you Kushat. Will any man  dispute me?\"    They knew the axe, if they did not know her. They looked from side to  side uneasily, completely at a loss, and Stark, still gasping on the  ground, thought that he had never seen anything as proud and beautiful  as she was then in her black mail, with her bright hair blowing and her  glance like blue lightning.    The nobles of Kushat chose that moment to charge. This strange unmasking  of the Mekhish lord had given them time to rally, and now they thought  that the Gods had wrought a miracle to help them. They found hope, where  they had lost everything but courage.    \"A wench!\" they cried. \"A strumpet of the camps. _A woman!_\"    They howled it like an epithet, and tore into the barbarians.    She who had been the Lord Ciaran drove the spurs in deep, so that the  beast leaped forward screaming. She went, and did not look to see if any  had followed, in among the men of Kushat. And the great axe rose and  fell, and rose again.    She killed three, and left two others bleeding on the stones, and not  once did she look back.    The clansmen found their tongues.    \"_Ciaran! Ciaran!_\"    The crashing shout drowned out the sound of battle. As one man, they  turned and followed her.    Stark, scrambling for his life underfoot, could not forbear smiling.  Their childlike minds could see only two alternatives--to slay her out  of hand, or to worship her. They had chosen to worship. He thought the  bards would be singing of the Lord Ciaran of Mekh as long as there were  men to listen.    He managed to take cover behind a wrecked booth, and presently make his  way out of the square. They had forgotten him, for the moment. He did  not wish to wait, just then, until they--or she--remembered.    She.    He still did not believe it, quite. He touched the bruise under his jaw  where she had struck him, and thought of the lithe, swift strength of  her, and the way she had ridden alone into battle. He remembered the  death of Thord, and how she had kept her red wolves tamed, and he was  filled with wonder, and a deep excitement.    He remembered what she had said to him once--_We are of one blood,  though we be strangers._    He laughed, silently, and his eyes were very bright.    The tide of war had rolled on toward the King City, where from the sound  of it there was hot fighting around the castle. Eddies of the main  struggle swept shrieking through the streets, but the rat-runs under the  Wall were clear. Everyone had stampeded inward, the victims with the  victors close on their heels. The short northern day was almost gone.    He found a hiding place that offered reasonable safety, and settled  himself to wait.    Night came, but he did not move. From the sounds that reached him, the  sacking of Kushat was in full swing. They were looting the richer  streets first. Their upraised voices were thick with wine, and mingled  with the cries of women. The reflection of many fires tinged the sky.    By midnight the sounds began to slacken, and by the second hour after  the city slept, drugged with wine and blood and the weariness of battle.  Stark went silently out into the streets, toward the King City.    According to the immemorial pattern of Martian city-states, the castles  of the king and the noble families were clustered together in solitary  grandeur. Many of the towers were fallen now, the great halls open to  the sky. Time had crushed the grandeur that had been Kushat, more  fatally than the boots of any conqueror.    In the house of the king, the flamboys guttered low and the chieftains  of Mekh slept with their weary pipers among the benches of the banquet  hall. In the niches of the tall, carved portal, the guards nodded over  their spears. They, too, had fought that day. Even so, Stark did not go  near them.    Shivering slightly in the bitter wind, he followed the bulk of the  massive walls until he found a postern door, half open as some kitchen  knave had left it in his flight. Stark entered, moving like a shadow.           *       *       *       *       *    The passageway was empty, dimly lighted by a single torch. A stairway  branched off from it, and he climbed that, picking his way by guess and  his memories of similar castles he had seen in the past.    He emerged into a narrow hall, obviously for the use of servants. A  tapestry closed the end, stirring in the chill draught that blew along  the floor. He peered around it, and saw a massive, vaulted corridor, the  stone walls panelled in wood much split and blackened by time, but still  showing forth the wonderful carvings of beasts and men, larger than life  and overlaid with gold and bright enamel.    From the corridor a single doorway opened--and Otar slept before it,  curled on a pallet like a dog.    Stark went back down the narrow hall. He was sure that there must be a  back entrance to the king's chambers, and he found the little door he  was looking for.    From there on was darkness. He felt his way, stepping with infinite  caution, and presently there was a faint gleam of light filtering around  the edges of another curtain of heavy tapestry.    He crept toward it, and heard a man's slow breathing on the other side.    He drew the curtain back, a careful inch. The man was sprawled on a  bench athwart the door. He slept the honest sleep of exhaustion, his  sword in his hand, the stains of his day's work still upon him. He was  alone in the small room. A door in the farther wall was closed.    Stark hit him, and caught the sword before it fell. The man grunted once  and became utterly relaxed. Stark bound him with his own harness and  shoved a gag in his mouth, and went on, through the door in the opposite  wall.    The room beyond was large and high and full of shadows. A fire burned  low on the hearth, and the uncertain light showed dimly the hangings and  the rich stuffs that carpeted the floor, and the dark, sparse shapes of  furniture.    Stark made out the lattice-work of a covered bed, let into the wall  after the northern fashion.    She was there, sleeping, her red-gold hair the colour of the flames.    He stood a moment, watching her, and then, as though she sensed his  presence, she stirred and opened her eyes.    She did not cry out. He had known that she would not. There was no fear  in her. She said, with a kind of wry humor, \"I will have a word with my  guards about this.\"           *       *       *       *       *    She flung aside the covering and rose. She was almost as tall as he,  white-skinned and very straight. He noted the long thighs, the narrow  loins and magnificent shoulders, the small virginal breasts. She moved  as a man moves, without coquetry. A long furred gown, that Stark guessed  had lately graced the shoulders of the king, lay over a chair. She put  it on.    \"Well, wild man?\"    \"I have come to warn you.\" He hesitated over her name, and she said,    \"My mother named me Ciara, if that seems better to you.\" She gave him  her falcon's glance. \"I could have slain you in the square, but now I  think you did me a service. The truth would have come out  sometime--better then, when they had no time to think about it.\" She  laughed. \"They will follow me now, over the edge of the world, if I ask  them.\"    Stark said slowly, \"Even beyond the Gates of Death?\"    \"Certainly, there. Above all, there!\"    She turned to one of the tall windows and looked out at the cliffs and  the high notch of the pass, touched with greenish silver by the little  moons.    \"Ban Cruach was a great king. He came out of nowhere to rule the  Norlands with a rod of iron, and men speak of him still as half a god.  Where did he get his power, if not from beyond the Gates of Death? Why  did he go back there at the end of his days, if not to hide away his  secret? Why did he build Kushat to guard the pass forever, if not to  hoard that power out of reach of all the other nations of Mars?    \"Yes, Stark. My men will follow me. And if they do not, I will go  alone.\"    \"You are not Ban Cruach. Nor am I.\" He took her by the shoulders.  \"Listen, Ciara. You're already king in the Norlands, and half a legend  as you stand. Be content.\"    \"Content!\" Her face was close to his, and he saw the blaze of it, the  white intensity of ambition and an iron pride. \"Are you content?\" she  asked him. \"Have you ever been content?\"    He smiled. \"For strangers, we do know each other well. No. But the spurs  are not so deep in me.\"    \"The wind and the fire. One spends its strength in wandering, the other  devours. But one can help the other. I made you an offer once, and you  said you would not bargain unless you could look into my eyes. Look  now!\"    He did, and his hands upon her shoulders trembled.    \"No,\" he said harshly. \"You're a fool, Ciara. Would you be as Otar, mad  with what you have seen?\"    \"Otar is an old man, and likely crazed before he crossed the mountains.  Besides--I am not Otar.\"    Stark said somberly, \"Even the bravest may break. Ban Cruach  himself....\"    She must have seen the shadow of that horror in his eyes, for he felt  her body tense.    \"What of Ban Cruach? What do you know, Stark? Tell me!\"    He was silent, and she went from him angrily.    \"You have the talisman,\" she said. \"That I am sure of. And if need be, I  will flay you alive to get it!\" She faced him across the room. \"But  whether I get it or not, I will go through the Gates of Death. I must  wait, now, until after the thaw. The warm wind will blow soon, and the  gorges will be running full. But afterward, I will go, and no talk of  fears and demons will stop me.\"    She began to pace the room with long strides, and the full skirts of the  gown made a subtle whispering about her.    \"You do not know,\" she said, in a low and bitter voice. \"I was a  girl-c"]]]
