[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#8)"],[1,"sizes of grains is incorrect; there must be enough  difference in the size of the grains to provide voids so large that the  smaller grains will enter them and not wedge the larger grains apart.  Turning now to the shape of the grains, the tests showed that rounded  grains give less voids than angular grains. Using sand having a  composition of L_{5}M_{3}F_{2} Feret got the following results:                                         --Per cent. Voids--  Kind of Grains.                       Shaken.

Chandler      30         Clean    ~Voids in Broken Stone and Gravel.~--The percentage of voids in broken  stone varies with the nature of the stone: whether it is broken by hand  or by crushers; with the kind of crusher used, and upon whether it is  screened or crusher-run product. The voids in broken stone seldom  exceed 52 per cent. even when the fragments are of uniform size and the  stone is shoveled loose into the measuring box. The following records of  actual determinations of voids in broken stone cover a sufficiently wide  range of conditions to show about the limits of variation.    The following are results of tests made by Mr. A. N. Johnson, State  Engineer of Illinois, to determine the variation in voids in crushed  stone due to variation in size and to method of loading into the  measuring box. The percentage of voids was determined by weighing the  amount of water added to fill the box:               Method of          Per cent.  Size.

Dropping the stone 20 ft. reduced the voids some 12 to 15 per  cent. as compared with shoveling.

Table IV gives the voids in broken stone as determined by various  engineers; it requires no explanation. Table V, taken from Feret's  tests, shows the effect of changes in granulometric composition on the  amount of voids in both broken stone and gravel. Considering the column  giving voids in stone it is to be noted first how nearly equal the voids  are for stone of uniform size whatever that size be. As was the case  with sand a mixture of coarse and fine particles gives the fewest voids;  for stone an L_{1}M_{0}F_{1} mixture and for gravel an L_{8}M_{0}F_{2}  mixture. Tamping reduces the voids in broken stone. Mr. Geo. W. Rafter  gives the voids in clean, hand-broken limestone passing a 2½-in. ring as  43 per cent. after being lightly shaken and 37½ per cent. after being  rammed. Generally speaking heavy ramming will reduce the voids in loose  stone about 20 per cent.    It is rare that gravel has less than 30 per cent. or more than 45 per  cent. voids. If the pebbles vary considerably in size so that the small  fit in between the large, the voids may be as low as 30 per cent. but if  the pebbles are tolerably uniform in size the voids will approach 45 per  cent. Table V shows the effect of granulometric composition on the voids  in gravel as determined by Feret. Mr. H. Von Schon gives the following  granulometric analysis of a gravel having 34.1 per cent. voids:    Retained on 1-in. ring, per cent.          10.70  Retained on 3/8-in. ring, per cent.        23.65  Retained on No. 4 sieve, per cent.          8.70  Retained on No. 10 sieve, per cent.        17.14  Retained on No. 20 sieve, per cent.        21.76  Retained on No. 30 sieve, per cent.         6.49  Retained on No. 40 sieve, per cent.         5.96  Passed a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],[0,"The Story of Wool (#8)"],[1,"man smiled at the boy.    \"That is generous of you, Donald boy. I appreciate it. No, I do not see  how you could help me by remaining. You go with Sandy and when I need  you I will send for you. In the meantime Thornton and I will get on very  well here.\"    \"Thornton! Isn't he going to the range with one of the new herds?\"    \"Not at present. There is a great deal of work to be done here. I prefer  to keep him to help me.\"    \"I wish you would have somebody else to help you and let Thornton take  the herd, father.\"    \"I think he is better here.\"    \"Very well. You know best,\" declared Donald. \"Shall you really feel all  right if I go with Sandy?\"    \"Yes, indeed. I want you to learn every phase of ranch life that you  can. Then if anything ever decided you to take up wool-growing as a  business you would come to it with a knowledge I never had. It would be  far more interesting on that account. If, on the other hand, you decided  on some other work in life you at least would have learned something of  one of the great industries of our country and would be a broader-minded  citizen in consequence.\"    \"I am sure I should, father. Why, ever since I have seen how big America  is I am lots prouder that I am an American.\"    His father smiled at his enthusiasm, then added gently:    \"Yes, but size is not everything. It is what a country is doing, or  trying to do, to better the conditions of her people that makes her  truly great. You know some of the things that are done to make life  happy, healthful, and comfortable for those who live in our cities. Now  go out on the range. Look about you. See all that thoughtful, far-seeing  men are doing to protect our forests, hillsides, streams; see how our  government is entering into the life of those who live not in cities but  on farms and ranches. You will find our country is doing much on the  range beside merely issuing permits for us to graze there.\"    \"What sort of things?\"    \"Sandy knows; he'll show you. In spite of the fact that he was born a  Scotchman he is as good an American as I know. He appreciates the  benefits of this wonderful land enough to desire to be a helpful,  law-abiding citizen. He does not accept all the advantages America  offers without giving something in return, you see.\"    \"Sandy is too proud to take everything for nothing, father.\"    \"He is also too honest, son. Now go and get your camping traps together.  I expect by afternoon to have a telegram that will answer in place of  permits until they can be mailed to us. As soon as they come you and  Sandy can start off; and in case they do not come to-day I can send them  after you by a mounted messenger. So I think you'd better set out  anyway. Wear your tramping shoes and carry your sleeping-bag. You better  ask Sandy if there is anything else he wants you to take.\"    Donald needed no second bidding.    He was in the highest of spirits.    An hour later and he had said good-bye to his father and Thornton, and  was on his way to the range with Sandy McCulloch. At their backs a band  of about two thousand sheep ambled along, the four dogs, Robin, Prince  Charlie, Colin, and Hector, dashing in and out among them to keep the  stragglers well in the path.    The trail Sandy was following led across the open fields and ascending  gradually, made for the chain of low hills faintly outlined in the  far-away blue haze. Beyond these hills loomed more distant mountains,  their tops capped with snow. These mountains, Sandy told Donald, were  the foot-hills of the Rockies.    It was quite evident that Sandy was now in his element. He swung along  with slow but steady gait, carrying his pack easily and swinging his  staff. His eye was alert for every movement of the flock. Now he would  turn and draw some straying creature into place by putting his crook  around one of its back legs. Sometimes he would motion the dogs to drive  the herd along faster.    To an eastern-bred lad who had lived all his life in a city the scene  was wonderfully novel. The great blue stretch of sky seemed endless. How  still the country was! Had it not been for the muffled tramp of hoofs,  the low bleating of the herd, the flat-toned note of the sheep-bells,  there would not have been a sound. The quiet of the day cast its spell  everywhere. Sandy, who was usually chary enough of his words, preserved  even a stricter silence. Although his lips were parted with a contented  smile, only once did he venture to break the quiet and that was when he  softly hummed a bar or two of \"There Were Hundred Pipers\"--a favorite  song of his.    At last Donald, who was bubbling over with questions, could bear it no  longer.    \"Are you always so quiet, Sandy, when you go to the range?\" he asked.    The Scotchman roused himself.    \"Why, laddie, I was almost forgetting you were here! Aye, being with a  flock is a quiet life. You have nobody to talk to on the range--nobody  except the dogs; so you fall into the way of thinking a heap and saying  but little. I like it. Some herders, though, find it a hard sort of  existence. Many a man has sat alone day after day on the range, watching  the sheep work their way in and out of the flock until in his sleep he  could picture that sea of gray and white moving, moving, moving! It was  always before him, sleeping or waking. It is a bad thing for a shepherd  to get into that state of mind. We call it getting locoed.\"    \"What does that mean?\"    \"You must know that on the hills grows a weed called loco-weed.  Sometimes the sheep find and eat it, and it makes them dull and  stupid--you know how you feel when you take gas to have your teeth  pulled. Yes? Well, it's like that. We never let the herd get it if we  can help it, and if they do we drive them away from it. They will go  right back again, too, and eat more if you do not watch them. That's  what loco-weed is.\"    \"And the shepherds?\"    \"When a man gets dull and stupid by being alone so much, and sees sheep  all the time--even when his eyes are shut--the best thing he can do is  to leave the range. Some folks can stand being alone, others can't. Why,  I have known of herders being alone until they actually wouldn't  talk--they couldn't. They didn't want to speak or be spoken to and were  ready to shoot any one who came upon them on the range and disturbed  them. Once I knew of a herder leaving a ranch because the boss said  good-morning to him. He complained that things were getting too  sociable.\"    \"I should think the herders would like to see people when they are alone  so much.\"    \"Aye. Wouldn't you! But no. In Wyoming there is a law that no herder  shall be sent out alone to tend flocks; men must go in pairs. More than  that they must have little traveling libraries of a few books. The  reason for that is to prevent them from sitting with their eyes fixed  vacantly on the moving sheep all the time. It is a good law. Some time,  likely, they will have it in all the states.\"    \"I mean to tell father about it. We could do that at our ranch easily,\"  said Donald. \"Do you get lonely on the range, Sandy?\"    \"Nay, nay, laddie. It is many a year that I have been alone on the  hills. I love it. There is always plenty to do. Sometimes I play tunes  on my harmonica. Again I'll spend weeks carving flowers and figures on a  staff. Then I have my dogs, and they are rare company. I sleep a good  part of the day, you know, and watch the flock at night.\"    \"But I should think you would sleep at night.\"    \"I couldn't do that.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because there is more danger to the sheep at night. It is then that the  wild creatures steal down and attack the herds.\"    \"Wild creatures?\"    \"Bears, bob-cats, cougars, and coyotes.\"    \"On the range!\" cried Donald.    \"Where else?\"    \"But I never thought of such animals being on the range!\" murmured the  boy.    Sandy flashed him a smile.    \"You're no in a city park here, laddie,\" he observed emphatically.  \"There are all sorts of prowling creatures abroad at night. They are not  after us--never fear. It is the poor, helpless sheep they are after.\"    \"Do you suppose, Sandy, that I shall see a bear?\" asked Donald, his eyes  sparkling.    \"Verra likely. For your sake I hope you may; for the sake of the herd I  hope not. I have seen many on the range and have shot not a few. Down at  the ranch I have a long chain made of bears' claws.\"    Donald's eyes opened wider and wider.    \"I'd like to see a bear,\" cried he. \"Just see him, you know--not have  him hurt the sheep.\"    \"Mayhap you'll get your wish.\"    Thus--now talking, now lapsing into big, silent pauses, Donald and Sandy  jogged on. At sundown they stopped for the night near a water-hole and  here the flock was refreshed by a draught from a clear mountain stream.  Then Sandy unpacked his saucepans, built a fire, and fried bacon which  he laid--smoking hot--between two slices of bread. Was ever a meal so  delicious, Donald wondered! Supper finished, the little portable tent  was set up, more wood heaped on the fire, and the camp pitched for the  night. Donald was tired out. After the sheep were bedded down around  them, he crept only too gladly into his sleeping-bag and was soon  oblivious of the range, the herd, and even Sandy himself.           *       *       *       *       *    When he awoke it was with a sense of being cramped within a small space.  He opened his eyes. It took him a few moments to collect his wits and  remember where he was. Ah, yes! Here was the little low tent over his  head, and just outside blinked the embers of the fire where he and Sandy  had cooked their supper.    [Illustration: THEY STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT]    He sat up softly and peered out into the night.    The country was flooded with moonlight in the brilliancy of which the  ridges of the far-off hills stood out clearly; even the pool in the  midst of the pasture caught the radiance and gleamed like a mirror. But  amid all the beauty a subtle feeling of"]]]
