Every piece must be  examined to make sure that it is perfect, and it must be thoroughly  seasoned and kiln-dried to free it from oil. Then it goes through a  grooving-machine which cuts out a groove half as deep as the lead.  The lead is laid into one piece, another is glued on top of it; and  there is a pencil ready for work.

(7) The pencil varnished  and stamped.]    Such a pencil would be useful, but to sell well it must also be  pretty; and therefore it goes through machinery which makes it round  or oval or six-sided, as the case may be, rubs it smooth, and  varnishes it, and then, with gold leaf or silver leaf or aluminum or  ink, stamps upon it the name of the maker, and also a number or letter  to show how hard the lead is.    The pencil is now ready for sale, but many people like to have an  eraser in the end, and this requires still more work. These erasers  are round or flat or six-sided or wedge-shaped. They are let into the  pencil itself, or into a nickel tip, or drawn over the end like a cap,  so that any one's special whim may be gratified. Indeed, however hard  to please any one may be, he ought to be able to find a pencil to suit  his taste, for a single factory in the United States makes more than  six hundred kinds of pencils, and makes so many of them that if they  were laid end to end they would reach three times across the continent.    There are many exceedingly cheap pencils, but they are expensive in  the end, because they are poorly made. The wood will often split in  sharpening, and the lead is of poor materials so badly mixed that it  may write blacker in one place than another, and is almost sure to  break. Good pencils bearing the name of a reliable firm are cheapest.          VII    THE DISHES ON OUR TABLES      If any one should give you a lump of clay and ask you to make a bowl,  how should you set about it? The first thing would be, of course, to  put it on a table so you could work on it with both hands. You would  make a depression at the top and push out the sides and smooth them as  best you could. It would result in a rough, uneven sort of bowl, and  before it was done, you would have made one discovery, namely, that if  the table only turned around in front of you, you could see all sides  of the bowl from the same position, and it would be easier to make it  regular. This is just what the potter's wheel does. It is really two  horizontal wheels. The upper one is a disk a foot or two in diameter.  This is connected by a shaft with the lower one, which is much larger.  When the potter was at work at a wheel of this sort, he stood on one  foot and turned the lower wheel with the other, thus setting the upper  wheel in motion. This was called a \"kick-wheel.\" As wheels are made  now, the potter sits at his work and turns the wheel by means of a  treadle.    Almost any kind of clay will make a dish, but no one kind will make  it so well that the addition of some other kind would not improve it.  Whatever clays are chosen, they must be prepared with great care to  make sure that not one grain in them is coarser than any other.  Sometimes one will slip through, and you can see on the finished dish  what a bad-looking place it makes. Even for the coarsest earthenware,  such as flower-pots, the moist clay is forced down a cylinder and  through a wire sieve; and for stoneware and porcelain it has to go  through several processes. When flint and feldspar are used, they are  ground fine at the quarry. On reaching the factory, they are mixed  with the proper quantities of other clays--but in just what proportions  is one of the secrets of the trade. Then they go into \"plungers\" or  \"blungers,\" great round tanks with arms extending from a shaft in the  center. The shaft revolves and the arms beat the clay till all the sand  and pebbles have settled on the bottom, and the fine clay grains are  floating in the water above them. These pass into canvas bags. The  water is forced out through the canvas, and on every bag there is left  a thin sheet of moist clay. If this is to be used for the finest work,  it is ground and pounded and washed still more, until it is a wonder  that any of it survives; then it is sifted through a screen so fine  that its meshes are only one one hundred and fiftieth of an inch  across. Now it becomes \"slip,\" and after a little more beating and  tumbling about, it is ready to go to the man at the wheel.    This man is called the \"thrower,\" because he lifts the lump of clay  above his head and throws it down heavily upon the center of the  wheel. The things that happen to that lump of clay when he touches it  and the wheel revolves seem like the work of magic. He presses his  thumbs into it from above and draws the walls up between his thumbs  and fingers. He clasps his hands around it, and it grows tall and  slender. He lays his finger on the top of the little column of clay,  and it flattens in a moment. He points his finger at it, barely  touching it, and a little groove appears, running around the whole  mass. He seems to be wasting considerable time in playing with it, but  all the while he is making sure that the clay is perfectly uniform and  that there are no bubbles of air in it. He holds a piece of leather  against the outside surface and a wet sponge against the inside, to  make them perfectly smooth; and in a moment he has made a bowl. He  holds his bent finger against the top of the bowl, and it becomes a  vase. With another touch of his magical finger the top of the vase  rolls over into a lip. If he makes a cup or a mug, he models a handle  in clay and fastens it in place with slip. When it is done, he draws a  wire deftly between the article and the table, and puts it on a board  to dry.    When you watch a potter at work, it all looks so simple and easy that  you feel sure you could do it; but see how skillfully he uses his  hands, how strong they are, and yet how lithe and delicate in their  movements. See into what odd positions he sometimes stretches them;  and yet these are plainly the only positions in which they could do  their work. See how every finger does just what he wishes it to do.  Notice all these things, and you will not be so certain that making  pottery is the easiest thing in the world.    No two pieces of hand work are exactly the same; and skillful as the  potter is, his pieces are not precisely alike. Many of them therefore  are passed over to the turner for finishing. He uses an ordinary  lathe, and with this he thins any place that may be a little too  thick, rounds the edge, and smooths it. The article is partly dried  when he takes it, and so its walls can be cut thinner. When it leaves  his lathe, all signs of hand work have vanished, but the dish is  exactly like the others of the set, and this is what the greater  number of people want. In some potteries there is hardly a throwing  wheel in use, and articles are formed in plaster of Paris moulds.  There are two ways of using these moulds. By one method, the mould is  put upon a \"jigger,\" a power machine which keeps it revolving, and  clay is pressed against its walls from within. Above the mould is a  piece of iron cut in the shape of the inside curve of the bowl or  whatever is being made. This skims off all the extra clay from the  inside of the walls. Plates and saucers are made on a jigger. The  mould used for this work is a model of the top of the plate. The  workman makes a sort of pancake of clay and throws it upon the mould.  A second mould, shaped like half of the bottom of the plate, is  brought down close and revolves, cutting off all the extra clay and  shaping the bottom of the plate.    When the very finest ware is to be made, the mould is used in quite  another fashion. If a pitcher, for instance, is to be cast, the mould  is made in two sections and tied tightly together. Then the slip is  poured into it and left for a while. The plaster of Paris absorbs the  water and a layer of clay is formed all about the walls. When this  is thick enough, the liquid is poured out, and after the pitcher has  dried awhile, the mould is carefully opened and the pitcher is very  gently taken out. The handle is made in a little mould of its own and  fastened on with slip. \"Eggshell\" porcelain is made in this way. The  clay shell becomes smaller as it dries, so there is no trouble about  removing it from the mould--if one knows how. If a large article is to  be cast, the mould is made in sections. Of course this fine ware must  all be made by hand, especially as machines do not work well with the  finest clays; but cheap dishes are all made by machinery.    After any clay article is thrown, or moulded, or cast, it is passed  through a little doorway and set upon a shelf in a great revolving  cage. The air in this cage is kept at about 85 deg. F.; but this heat  is nothing to what is to follow; and after the articles are thoroughly  dry, they are placed in boxes of coarse fire-clay, which are called  \"saggers,\" piled up in a kiln, the doors are closed, and the fires are  lighted. For a day and night, sometimes for two days and two nights,  the fires burn. The heat goes up to 2000 deg. or 2500 deg. F. Every few  hours test pieces, which were put in for this purpose, are taken out.  When they are found to be sufficiently baked, the fire-holes are bricked  up and the furnace is left for two days longer to cool. The ware is then  called \"biscuit.\"    Biscuit is dull and porous. It is soon to be glazed, but first whatever  underglaze decorating is desired may be done. Sometimes the decorations  are painted by hand, and sometimes they are printed on thin paper, laid  upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28570"],[0,"Astronomy of To-day: A Popular Introduction in Non-Technical Language (#8)"],[1,"displacement as a result of our own change of position  being known as \"parallax.\" The dependence between the two is so  mathematically exact, that if we know the amount of our own change of  place, and if we observe the amount of the consequent displacement of  any object, we are enabled to calculate its precise distance from us.  Thus it comes to pass that distances can be measured without the  necessity of moving over them; and the breadth of a river, for instance,  or the distance from us of a ship at sea, can be found merely by such  means.    It is by the application of this principle to the wider field of the sky  that we are able to ascertain the distance of celestial bodies. We have  noted that it requires a goodly change of place on our own part to shift  the position in which some object in the far distance is seen by us. To  two persons separated by, say, a few hundred yards, a ship upon the  horizon will appear pretty much in the same direction. They would  require, in fact, to be much farther apart in order to displace it  sufficiently for the purpose of estimating their distance from it. It  is the same with regard to the moon. Two observers, standing upon our  earth, will require to be some thousands of miles apart in order to see  the position of our satellite sufficiently altered with regard to the  starry background, to give the necessary data upon which to ground their  calculations.    The change of position thus offered by one side of the earth's surface  at a time is, however, not sufficient to displace any but the nearest  celestial bodies. When we have occasion to go farther afield we have to  seek a greater change of place. This we can get as a consequence of the  earth's movement around the sun. Observations, taken several days apart,  will show the effect of the earth's change of place during the interval  upon the positions of the other bodies of our system. But when we desire  to sound the depths of space beyond, and to reach out to measure the  distance of the nearest star, we find ourselves at once thrown upon the  greatest change of place which we can possibly hope for; and this we get  during the long journey of many millions of miles which our earth  performs around the sun during the course of each year. But even this  last change of place, great as it seems in comparison with terrestrial  measurements, is insufficient to show anything more than the tiniest  displacements in a paltry forty-three out of the entire host of the  stars.    We can thus realise at what a disadvantage the ancients were. The  measuring instruments at their command were utterly inadequate to detect  such small displacements. It was reserved for the telescope to reveal  them; and even then it required the great telescopes of recent times to  show the slight changes in the position of the nearer stars, which were  caused by the earth's being at one time at one end of its orbit, and  some six months later at the other end--stations separated from each  other by a gulf of about one hundred and eighty-six millions of miles.    The actual distances of certain celestial bodies being thus  ascertainable, it becomes a matter of no great difficulty to determine  the actual sizes of the measurable ones. It is a matter of everyday  experience that the size which any object appears to have, depends  exactly upon the distance it is from us. The farther off it is the  smaller it looks; the nearer it is the bigger. If, then, an object which  lies at a known distance from us looks such and such a size, we can of  course ascertain its real dimensions. Take the moon, for instance. As we  have already shown, we are able to ascertain its distance. We observe  also that it looks a certain size. It is therefore only a matter of  calculation to find what its actual dimensions should be, in order that  it may look that size at that distance away. Similarly we can ascertain  the real dimensions of the sun. The planets, appearing to us as points  of light, seem at first to offer a difficulty; but, by means of the  telescope, we can bring them, as it were, so much nearer to us, that  their broad expanses may be seen. We fail, however, signally with regard  to the stars; for they are so very distant, and therefore such tiny  points of light, that our mightiest telescopes cannot magnify them  sufficiently to show any breadth of surface.    Instead of saying that an object looks a certain breadth across, such  as a yard or a foot, a statement which would really mean nothing,  astronomers speak of it as measuring a certain angle. Such angles are  estimated in what are called \"degrees of arc\"; each degree being divided  into sixty minutes, and each minute again into sixty seconds. Popularly  considered the moon and sun _look_ about the same size, or, as an  astronomer would put it, they measure about the same angle. This is an  angle, roughly, of thirty-two minutes of arc; that is to say, slightly  more than half a degree. The broad expanse of surface which a celestial  body shows to us, whether to the naked eye, as in the case of the sun  and moon, or in the telescope, as in the case of other members of our  system, is technically known as its \"disc.\"          CHAPTER VII    ECLIPSES AND KINDRED PHENOMENA      Since some members of the solar system are nearer to us than others, and  all are again much nearer than any of the stars, it must often happen  that one celestial body will pass between us and another, and thus  intercept its light for a while. The moon, being the nearest object in  the universe, will, of course, during its motion across the sky,  temporarily blot out every one of the others which happen to lie in its  path. When it passes in this manner across the face of the sun, it is  said to _eclipse_ it. When it thus hides a planet or star, it is said to  _occult_ it. The reason why a separate term is used for what is merely a  case of obscuring light in exactly the same way, will be plain when one  considers that the disc of the sun is almost of the same apparent size  as that of the moon, and so the complete hiding of the sun can last but  a few minutes at the most; whereas a planet or a star looks so very  small in comparison, that it is always _entirely swallowed up for some  time_ when it passes behind the body of our satellite.    The sun, of course, occults planets and stars in exactly the same manner  as the moon does, but we cannot see these occultations on account of the  blaze of sunlight.    By reason of the small size which the planets look when viewed with the  naked eye, we are not able to note them in the act of passing over stars  and so blotting them out; but such occurrences may be seen in the  telescope, for the planetary bodies then display broad discs.    There is yet another occurrence of the same class which is known as a  _transit_. This takes place when an apparently small body passes across  the face of an apparently large one, the phenomenon being in fact the  exact reverse of an occultation. As there is no appreciable body nearer  to us than the moon, we can never see anything in transit across her  disc. But since the planets Venus and Mercury are both nearer to us than  the sun, they will occasionally be seen to pass across his face, and  thus we get the well-known phenomena called Transits of Venus and  Transits of Mercury.    As the satellites of Jupiter are continually revolving around him, they  will often pass behind or across his disc. Such occultations and  transits of satellites can be well observed in the telescope.    There is, however, a way in which the light of a celestial body may be  obscured without the necessity of its being hidden from us by one  nearer. It will no doubt be granted that any opaque object casts a  shadow when a strong light falls directly upon it. Thus the earth, under  the powerful light which is directed upon it from the sun, casts an  extensive shadow, though we are not aware of the existence of this  shadow until it falls upon something. The shadow which the earth casts  is indeed not noticeable to us until some celestial body passes into it.  As the sun is very large, and the earth in comparison very small, the  shadow thrown by the earth is comparatively short, and reaches out in  space for only about a million miles. There is no visible object except  the moon, which circulates within that distance from our globe, and  therefore she is the only body which can pass into this shadow. Whenever  such a thing happens, her surface at once becomes dark, for the reason  that she never emits any light of her own, but merely reflects that of  the sun. As the moon is continually revolving around the earth, one  would be inclined to imagine that once in every month, namely at what is  called _full moon_, when she is on the other side of the earth with  respect to the sun, she ought to pass through the shadow in question.  But this does not occur every time, because the moon's orbit is not  quite _upon the same plane_ with the earth's. It thus happens that time  after time the moon passes clear of the earth's shadow, sometimes above  it, and sometimes below it. It is indeed only at intervals of about six  months that the moon can be thus obscured. This darkening of her light  is known as an _eclipse of the moon_. It seems a great pity that custom  should oblige us to employ the one term \"eclipse\" for this and also for  the quite different occurrence, an eclipse of the sun; in which the  sun's face is hidden as a consequence of the moon's body coming directly  _between_ it and our eyes.    The popular mind seems always to have found it more difficult to grasp  the causes of an eclipse of the moon than an eclipse of the sun. As Mr.  J.E. Gore[4] puts it: \"The darkening of the sun's light by the  interposition of the moon's body seems more obvious than the passing of  the moon through the earth's shadow.\"    Eclipses of the moon furnish striking"]]]
