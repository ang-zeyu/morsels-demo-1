In spite of the Little Catechism and the uplifting influence of Emerson,  I looked on this probably mythical gentleman as one of the glories of  our family. And then there was an old man--very old--who walked up and  down Sixth Street with his head wrapped in a bandanna handkerchief,  bearing a parrot on his shoulder. The boys of the neighbourhood believed  that he was Sanson, the executioner of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette.  We shivered when we saw him; but we boasted of his existence in our  neighbourhood, all the same. After I had read \"Cagliostro\" I devoured  every line on the subject of the French Revolution I could find. It  seemed to me that I would have been willing to give five years out of  my life to have lived in Paris during those horrors, and to have rescued  Marie Antoinette and the Princess Elizabeth! Such brutalities seemed  impossible in our time; and yet I have since lived very near to friends  who went through even greater horrors in Russia--the Baroness Sophie de  Buxhoevenden, second lady-in-waiting to the Czarina, for instance, whose  letters lie before me as I write.    In spite of my taste for Carlyle, which induced me to dip into Jean Paul  Richter, of whose writings I remember only one line,         I love God and little children,    I did not get very far into his \"French Revolution.\" It seemed then an  unreal and lurid book.    Emerson led to Montaigne, whose essays, in an old edition which I had  from the Mechanics' Institute, of which my father was a committeeman,  delighted me beyond words. I liked Emerson's essay on \"Friendship\"  better than his, but for wit, quick repartee, general cheerfulness, he  reminded me of my favourite heroine in literature, Sir Walter Scott's  Catherine Seton! Later, I read with astonishment that Montaigne was an  unbeliever, a skeptic, almost a cynic. I was extremely indignant; he  seemed to me to be a very pious gentleman, with that wit and humour  which I seldom found in professedly pious books; and to this day I  cannot hear Montaigne talked of as a precursor of Voltaire without  believing that there is something crooked in the mind of the talker. So  much for the impressions made in youth, so much for the long, long  thoughts of which Longfellow sings.    Who is more amusingly cheerful than Montaigne, who more amusingly wise,  who so well bred and attractive, who knew the world better and took it  only as the world? Give me the old volume of Montaigne and a loaf of  bread--no Victrola singing to me in the wilderness!--a thermos bottle,  and one or two other things, and I can still spend the day in any wild  place! I did not, of course, know, in those early days, what in his  flavour attracted me. Afterward, I found that it was the very flavour  and essence of Old France. Carlyle's impressions of historical persons  interested me, but Montaigne was the most actual of living persons who  spoke to me in a voice I recognized as wholly his. To be sure, I read  him in Florio's translation.    I think it was about this time, too, that I discovered a very modern  writer, who charmed me very greatly. It was Justin McCarthy who  contributed a series of sketches of great men of the day to a magazine  called the _Galaxy_. He \"did\" Victor Emmanuel and Pope Pius IX. and  Bismarck, and many other of the worthies of the times. Nothing that he  wrote before or after this pleased me at all; but these sketches were so  interesting and apparently so true that they really became part of my  life. If I had been asked at this time who was my favourite of all  modern authors, and what the name of the composer I admired most, I  should have said Justin McCarthy and Offenbach! I regarded \"Voici le  Sabre\" in \"La Grande Duchesse\" as a masterpiece only to be compared to  an \"Ave Verum,\" by Pergolesi, which was often sung in St. Philip's  Church at the Offertory! A strange mixture, but the truth is the truth.  Although I have not been able to find Justin McCarthy's series of  sketches, they still hold a sweet place in my memory. Perhaps, like  other masterpieces that one loves in youth, one would now find them like  those beautiful creatures of the sea that seem to be vermilion and  purple and gold under the waves, but are drab and ugly things when taken  out of the water. This applies to some books that one reads with  pleasure in early days, and wonders, later, how they were endured!    There were not so many outdoor books in the late '60's as there are now.  We were all sent to Thoreau's \"Walden\" and Dana's \"Two Years Before the  Mast.\" \"Walden\" I learned to like, but I much preferred Fenimore  Cooper's description of nature. \"Walden\" struck me as the book of a man  playing at out-of-doors, imagining his wildness, and never really liking  to be too far from the town. Singularly enough, it was not until I  discovered Hamerton's \"A Painter's Camp\" that I began to see that nature  had beauties in all weathers. In truth, I hate to confess that nature  alone never appealed to me. A landscape without human beings seemed  deadly dull; and I did not understand until I grew much older that I had  really believed that good art was an improvement on nature.    I have not the slightest idea in what light the modern critics see the  works of Philip Gilbert Hamerton. I tried to read one of his novels  recently, and failed; but let me say that, allowing for receptivity and  what one may call temperament, I know of no book more revealing as to  the relations of nature and art than \"A Painter's Camp.\" I recall  vividly the words of the beginning of the preface to the first edition:         It is known to all who are acquainted with the present condition of       the fine arts in England that landscape-painters rely less on       memory and invention than formerly, and that their work from nature       is much more laborious than it used to be.    I had seen so many pictures that seemed to be \"made up\" in the artist's  studio and I knew so well from my experience in the drawing classes at  school, how nature was neglected for artificial models, that I hailed  these words with great joy.    Everything in life was rather conventional, rather fixed, for the  Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, to which our country owes the  beginning of the aesthetic awakening, had not yet taken place. It may  seem strange to this generation that we were limited to the wood-cuts in  Godey's _Lady's Book_, the illustrations in _Harper's Magazine_, and an  occasional picture in some short-lived periodical. The reign of the  chromo had just begun. Rogers's groups were a fixture in nearly every  self-respecting house, though I am glad to say, in my own family, very  good casts of the Clytie and the Discus-thrower filled their place. My  father greatly admired Power's Greek Slave, whose praises had been  celebrated in the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_; but my mother regarded it as  almost \"improper.\"    Nearly every youth of my generation, in Philadelphia, wanted not exactly  something better, but something more vivid. There were few sports; long  walks and a little cricket supplied the place of the coming baseball and  tennis.    In his \"Steeplejack,\" James Huneker speaks of his weekly walks with Mr.  Edward Roth, the head of a military school and the author of \"Christus  Judex.\" I, too, looked on these walks with an occasional row on the  Schuylkill with him as the best part of my education. But this was  later. All we could do, then, in our moments of leisure, was to walk and  talk and read.    The cult of the out-of-doors had not yet begun to be developed. The  beginning of \"A Painter's Camp\" was most attractive to my thirsty soul.  Mr. Hamerton says:         I had a wild walk yesterday. I have a notion of encamping on the       Boulsworth moors to study heather; and heartily tired of being       caged up here in my library, with nothing to see but wet       garden-walks and dripping yew trees, and a sundial whereon no       shadow had fallen the livelong day, I determined, in spite of the       rain to be off to the moors to choose a site for my encampment. Not       very far from this house still dwells an old servant of my uncle's       with whom I am on the friendliest terms. So I called upon this       neighbour on my way and asked him if he would take a walk with me       to the hills. Jamie stared a little and remarked that \"it ur feefi       weet\" but accompanied me nevertheless, and a very pleasant walk we       had of it.    Hamerton opened his book in Jane Eyre's country; our family had lately  read \"Jane Eyre.\" This added interest to the volume, and there came the  details of the invention of the new hut, intended to be a shelter  against all weathers, so that the artist might study nature on intimate  terms. He made it in order to paint the heather at close range. Now,  this was a revelation! It had never hitherto occurred to me that the  heather changes its aspect day by day, or indeed that our pet place of  beauty, the Wissahickon Creek, or river if you like, was not the same  every day in the year except when the ice bound it! This may seem a  rather stupid state of mind; but it is the stupidity that is very  common. I could understand how interesting it would be to be in  snow-fall while yet safely out of it. Mr. Hamerton thus described his  hut:         It consists entirely of panels, of which the largest are two feet       six inches square: these panels can be carried separately on       packhorses, or even on men's backs, and then united together by       iron bolts into a strong little building. Four of the largest       panels serve as windows, being each of them filled with a large       pane of excellent plate-glass. When erected, the walls present a       perfectly smooth surface outside, and a panelled interior; the       floor being formed in exactly the same manner, with the panelled or     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#8)"],[1,"is the even-handed dealing of the world!' he said. 'There is  nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it  professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!'    'You fear the world too much,' she answered gently. 'All your other  hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid  reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until  the master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'    'What then?' he retorted. 'Even if I have grown so much wiser, what  then? I am not changed towards you.'    She shook her head.    'Am I?'    'Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and  content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly  fortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made you  were another man.'    'I was a boy,' he said impatiently.    'Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,' she  returned. 'I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart  is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I  have thought of this I will not say. It is enough that I _have_ thought  of it, and can release you.'    'Have I ever sought release?'    'In words. No. Never.'    'In what, then?'    'In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of  life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of  any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,'  said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; 'tell me,  would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!'    He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of  himself. But he said, with a struggle, 'You think not.'    'I would gladly think otherwise if I could,' she answered. 'Heaven  knows! When _I_ have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and  irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,  yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless  girl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by  Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your  one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and  regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart,  for the love of him you once were.'    [Illustration: SHE LEFT HIM, AND THEY PARTED]    He was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed:    'You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have  pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the  recollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it  happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have  chosen!'    She left him, and they parted.    'Spirit!' said Scrooge, 'show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you  delight to torture me?'    'One shadow more!' exclaimed the Ghost.    'No more!' cried Scrooge. 'No more! I don't wish to see it. Show me no  more!'    But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him  to observe what happened next.    They were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or  handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful  young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,  until he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.  The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more  children there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;  and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty  children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting  itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but  no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed  heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to  mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most  ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I  never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all  the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the  precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!  to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold  young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to  have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And  yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have  questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the  lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose  waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in  short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest  license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.    [Illustration: _A flushed and boisterous group_]    But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately  ensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne  towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to  greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas  toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the  onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with  chairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of  brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his  neck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The  shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package  was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in  the act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than  suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden  platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and  gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough  that, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the  parlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where  they went to bed, and so subsided.    And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of  the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her  and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such  another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have  called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his  life, his sight grew very dim indeed.    'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an  old friend of yours this afternoon.'    'Who was it?'    'Guess!'    'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing  as he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'    'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut  up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His  partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.  Quite alone in the world, I do believe.'    'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'    'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the  Ghost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'    'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'    He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a  face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces  it had shown him, wrestled with it.    'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'    In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost  with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort  of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and  bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized  the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its  head.    [Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]    The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its  whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he  could not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken  flood upon the ground.    He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible  drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a  parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel  to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.    [Illustration]      STAVE THREE      [Illustration]          THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS      Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in  bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told  that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was  restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial  purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to  him through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned  uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this  new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own  hands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the  bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its  appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.    Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being  acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of  day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing  that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;  between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide  and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite  as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was  ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing  between a baby and a "]]]
