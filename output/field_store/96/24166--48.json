I have turned to thee  for aid; but if thou wilt not find it, I shall find it myself. Aulus  considers Lygia as a daughter; why should I look on her as a slave? And  since there is no other way, let her ornament the door of my house, let  her anoint it with wolf's fat, and let her sit at my hearth as wife.\"    \"Calm thyself, mad descendant of consuls. We do not lead in barbarians  bound behind our cars, to make wives of their daughters. Beware of  extremes. Exhaust simple, honorable methods, and give thyself and me  time for meditation. Chrysothemis seemed to me too a daughter of Jove,  and still I did not marry her, just as Nero did not marry Acte, though  they called her a daughter of King Attalus. Calm thyself! Think that if  she wishes to leave Aulus for thee, he will have no right to detain her.  Know also that thou art not burning alone, for Eros has roused in her  the flame too. I saw that, and it is well to believe me. Have patience.  There is a way to do everything, but to-day I have thought too much  already, and it tires me. But I promise that to-morrow I will think of  thy love, and unless Petronius is not Petronius, he will discover some  method.\"    They were both silent again.    \"I thank thee,\" said Vinicius at last. \"May Fortune be bountiful to  thee.\"    \"Be patient.\"    \"Whither hast thou given command to bear us?\"    \"To Chrysothemis.\"    \"Thou art happy in possessing her whom thou lovest.\"    \"I? Dost thou know what amuses me yet in Chrysothemis? This, that she is  false to me with my freedman Theokles, and thinks that I do not  notice it. Once I loved her, but now she amuses me with her lying and  stupidity. Come with me to her. Should she begin to flirt with thee, and  write letters on the table with her fingers steeped in wine, know that I  shall not be jealous.\"    And he gave command to bear them both to Chrysothemis.    But in the entrance Petronius put his hand on Vinicius's shoulder, and  said,--\"Wait; it seems to me that I have discovered a plan.\"    \"May all the gods reward thee!\"    \"I have it! I judge that this plan is infallible. Knowest what, Marcus?\"    \"I listen to thee, my wisdom.\"    \"Well, in a few days the divine Lygia will partake of Demeter's grain in  thy house.\"    \"Thou art greater than Caesar!\" exclaimed Vinicius with enthusiasm.          Chapter IV      IN fact, Petronius kept his promise. He slept all the day following his  visit to Chrysothemis, it is true; but in the evening he gave command to  bear him to the Palatine, where he had a confidential conversation with  Nero; in consequence of this, on the third day a centurion, at the  head of some tens of pretorian soldiers, appeared before the house of  Plautius.    The period was uncertain and terrible. Messengers of this kind were more  frequently heralds of death. So when the centurion struck the hammer at  Aulus's door, and when the guard of the atrium announced that there  were soldiers in the anteroom, terror rose through the whole house.  The family surrounded the old general at once, for no one doubted that  danger hung over him above all. Pomponia, embracing his neck with  her arms, clung to him with all her strength, and her blue lips moved  quickly while uttering some whispered phrase. Lygia, with a face pale  as linen, kissed his hand; little Aulus clung to his toga. From the  corridor, from chambers in the lower story intended for servant-women  and attendants, from the bath, from the arches of lower dwellings, from  the whole house, crowds of slaves began to hurry out, and the cries of  \"Heu! heu, me miserum!\" were heard. The women broke into great weeping;  some scratched their cheeks, or covered their heads with kerchiefs.    Only the old general himself, accustomed for years to look death  straight in the eye, remained calm, and his short eagle face became as  rigid as if chiselled from stone. After a while, when he had silenced  the uproar, and commanded the attendants to disappear, he said,--\"Let me  go, Pomponia. If my end has come, we shall have time to take leave.\"    And he pushed her aside gently; but she said,--\"God grant thy fate and  mine to be one, O Aulus!\"    Then, failing on her knees, she began to pray with that force which fear  for some dear one alone can give.    Aulus passed out to the atrium, where the centurion was waiting for him.  It was old Caius Hasta, his former subordinate and companion in British  wars.    \"I greet thee, general,\" said he. \"I bring a command, and the greeting  of Caesar; here are the tablets and the signet to show that I come in his  name.\"    \"I am thankful to Caesar for the greeting, and I shall obey the command,\"  answered Aulus. \"Be welcome, Hasta, and say what command thou hast  brought.\"    \"Aulus Plautius,\" began Hasta, \"Caesar has learned that in thy house is  dwelling the daughter of the king of the Lygians, whom that king during  the life of the divine Claudius gave into the hands of the Romans as a  pledge that the boundaries of the empire would never be violated by the  Lygians. The divine Nero is grateful to thee, O general, because thou  hast given her hospitality in thy house for so many years; but, not  wishing to burden thee longer, and considering also that the maiden as  a hostage should be under the guardianship of Caesar and the senate, he  commands thee to give her into my hands.\"    Aulus was too much a soldier and too much a veteran to permit himself  regret in view of an order, or vain words, or complaint. A slight  wrinkle of sudden anger and pain, however, appeared on his forehead.  Before that frown legions in Britain had trembled on a time, and even  at that moment fear was evident on the face of Hasta. But in view of the  order, Aulus Plautius felt defenceless. He looked for some time at the  tablets and the signet; then raising his eyes to the old centurion, he  said calmly,--\"Wait, Hasta, in the atrium till the hostage is delivered  to thee.\"    After these words he passed to the other end of the house, to the  hall called oecus, where Pomponia Graecina, Lygia, and little Aulus were  waiting for him in fear and alarm.    \"Death threatens no one, nor banishment to distant islands,\" said he;  \"still Caesar's messenger is a herald of misfortune. It is a question of  thee, Lygia.\"    \"Of Lygia?\" exclaimed Pomponia, with astonishment.    \"Yes,\" answered Aulus.    And turning to the maiden, he began: \"Lygia, thou wert reared in our  house as our own child; I and Pomponia love thee as our daughter. But  know this, that thou art not our daughter. Thou art a hostage, given  by thy people to Rome, and guardianship over thee belongs to Caesar. Now  Caesar takes thee from our house.\"    The general spoke calmly, but with a certain strange, unusual voice.  Lygia listened to his words, blinking, as if not understanding what the  question was. Pomponia's cheeks became pallid. In the doors leading  from the corridor to the oecus, terrified faces of slaves began to show  themselves a second time.    \"The will of Caesar must be accomplished,\" said Aulus.    \"Aulus!\" exclaimed Pomponia, embracing the maiden with her arms, as if  wishing to defend her, \"it would be better for her to die.\"    Lygia, nestling up to her breast, repeated, \"Mother, mother!\" unable in  her sobbing to find other words.    On Aulus's face anger and pain were reflected again. \"If I were alone in  the world,\" said he, gloomily, \"I would not surrender her alive, and my  relatives might give offerings this day to 'Jupiter Liberator.' But I  have not the right to kill thee and our child, who may live to happier  times. I will go to Caesar this day, and implore him to change his  command. Whether he will hear me, I know not. Meanwhile, farewell,  Lygia, and know that I and Pomponia ever bless the day in which thou  didst take thy seat at our hearth.\"    Thus speaking, he placed his hand on her head; but though he strove to  preserve his calmness, when Lygia turned to him eyes filled with tears,  and seizing his hand pressed it to her lips, his voice was filled with  deep fatherly sorrow.    \"Farewell, our joy, and the light of our eyes,\" said he.    And he went to the atrium quickly, so as not to let himself be conquered  by emotion unworthy of a Roman and a general.    Meanwhile Pomponia, when she had conducted Lygia to the cubiculum, began  to comfort, console, and encourage her, uttering words meanwhile which  sounded strangely in that house, where near them in an adjoining chamber  the lararium remained yet, and where the hearth was on which Aulus  Plautius, faithful to ancient usage, made offerings to the household  divinities. Now the hour of trial had come. On a time Virginius had  pierced the bosom of his own daughter to save her from the hands of  Appius; still earlier Lucretia had redeemed her shame with her life.  The house of Caesar is a den of infamy, of evil, of crime. But we, Lygia,  know why we have not the right to raise hands on ourselves! Yes! The law  under which we both live is another, a greater, a holier, but it gives  permission to defend oneself from evil and shame even should it happen  to pay for that defence with life and torment. Whoso goes forth pure  from the dwelling of corruption has the greater merit thereby. The earth  is that dwelling; but fortunately life is one twinkle of the eye, and  resurrection is only from the grave; beyond that not Nero, but Mercy  bears rule, and there instead of pain is delight, there instead of tears  is rejoicing.    Next she began to speak of herself. Yes! she was calm; but in her breast  there was no lack of painful wounds. For example, Aulus was a cataract  on her eye; the fountain of light had not flowed to him yet. Neither was  it permitted her to rear her son in Truth. When she thought, therefore,  that it might be thus to the end of her life, and that for them a moment  of separation might come which would be a hundred times more grievous  and terrible than that temporary one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#8)"],[1,"are set the two great lights and the  stars. The upper, therefore, is emphatically _reqi[=a]` hasshamayim_,  \"the firmament of heaven,\" of the \"uplifted.\" It is \"in the face  of\"--that is, \"before,\" or \"under the eyes of,\" \"beneath,\"--this higher  expanse that the fowls of the air fly to and fro.    The firmament, then, is that which Tennyson sings of as \"the central  blue,\" the seeming vault of the sky, which we can consider as at any  height above us that we please. The clouds are above it in one sense;  yet in another, sun, moon and stars, which are clearly far higher than  the clouds, are set in it.    There is no question therefore as to what is referred to by the word  \"firmament\"; but there is a question as to the etymological meaning of  the word, and associated with that, a question as to how the Hebrews  themselves conceived of the celestial vault.    The word _r[=a]qi[=a]`_, translated \"firmament,\" properly signifies \"an  expanse,\" or \"extension,\" something stretched or beaten out. The verb  from which this noun is derived is often used in Scripture, both as  referring to the heavens and in other connections. Thus in Job xxxvii.  18, the question is asked, \"Canst thou with Him _spread out_ the sky,  which is strong as a molten mirror?\" Eleazar, the priest, after the  rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram took the brazen censers of the  rebels, and they were \"_made broad_ plates for a covering of the altar.\"  The goldsmith described by Isaiah as making an idol, \"_spreadeth it  over_ with gold\"; whilst Jeremiah says, \"silver _spread_ into plates is  brought from Tarshish.\" Again, in Psalm cxxxvi., in the account of  creation we have the same word used with reference to the earth, \"To him  that _stretched out_ the earth above the waters.\" In this and in many  other passages the idea of extension is clearly that which the word is  intended to convey. But the Seventy, in making the Greek Version of the  Old Testament, were naturally influenced by the views of astronomical  science then held in Alexandria, the centre of Greek astronomy. Here,  and at this time, the doctrine of the crystalline spheres--a  misunderstanding of the mathematical researches of Eudoxus and  others--held currency. These spheres were supposed to be a succession of  perfectly transparent and invisible solid shells, in which the sun,  moon, and planets were severally placed. The Seventy no doubt considered  that in rendering _r[=a]qi[=a]`_, by _stere[=o]ma_, i. e. firmament,  thus conveying the idea of a solid structure, they were speaking the  last word of up-to-date science.    There should be no reluctance in ascribing to the Hebrews an erroneous  scientific conception if there is any evidence that they held it. We  cannot too clearly realize that the writers of the Scriptures were not  supernaturally inspired to give correct technical scientific  descriptions; and supposing they had been so inspired, we must bear in  mind that we should often consider those descriptions wrong just in  proportion to their correctness, for the very sufficient reason that not  even our own science of to-day has yet reached finality in all things.    There should be no reluctance in ascribing to the Hebrews an erroneous  scientific conception if there is any evidence that they held it. In  this case, there is no such evidence; indeed, there is strong evidence  to the contrary.    The Hebrew word _r[=a]qi[=a]`_, as already shown, really signifies  \"extension,\" just as the word for heaven, _shamayim_ means the  \"uplifted.\" In these two words, therefore, significant respectively of a  surface and of height, there is a recognition of the \"three  dimensions,\"--in other words, of Space.    When we wish to refer to super-terrestrial space, we have two  expressions in modern English by which to describe it: we can speak of  \"the vault of heaven,\" or of \"the canopy of heaven.\" \"The vault of  heaven\" is most used, it has indeed been recently adopted as the title  of a scientific work by a well-known astronomer. But the word _vault_  certainly gives the suggestion of a solid structure; whilst the word  _canopy_ calls up the idea of a slighter covering, probably of some  textile fabric.    The reasons for thinking that the Hebrews did not consider the  \"firmament\" a solid structure are, first, that the word does not  necessarily convey that meaning; next, that the attitude of the Hebrew  mind towards nature was not such as to require this idea. The question,  \"What holds up the waters above the firmament?\" would not have troubled  them. It would have been sufficient for them, as for the writer to the  Hebrews, to consider that God was \"upholding all things by the word of  His power,\" and they would not have troubled about the machinery. But  besides this, there are many passages in Scripture, some occurring in  the earliest books, which expressly speak of the clouds as carrying the  water; so that the expressions placing waters \"above the firmament,\" or  \"above the heavens,\" can mean no more than \"in the clouds.\" Indeed, as  we shall see, quite a clear account is given of the atmospheric  circulation, such as could hardly be mended by a modern poet.    It is true that David sang that \"the _foundations_ of heaven moved and  shook, because He was wroth,\" and Job says that \"the _pillars_ of heaven  tremble and are astonished at His reproof.\" But not only are the  references to foundations and pillars evidently intended merely as  poetic imagery, but they are also used much more frequently of the  earth, and yet at the same time Job expressly points out that God  \"stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth  upon nothing.\" The Hebrew formed no ideas like those of the Hindus, who  thought the earth supported by elephants, the elephants by a tortoise,  the tortoise by a snake.    In Scripture, in most cases the word \"earth\" (_eretz_) does not mean the  solid mass of this our planet, but only its surface; the \"dry land\" as  opposed to the \"seas\"; the countries, the dwelling place of man and  beast. The \"pillars\" or \"foundations\" of the earth in this sense are the  great systems of the rocks, and these were conceived of as directly  supported by the power of God, without any need of intermediary  structures. The Hebrew clearly recognized that it is the will of God  alone that keeps the whole secure.    Thus Hannah sang--         \"The pillars of the earth are the Lord's,          And He hath set the world upon them.\"    And Asaph represents the Lord as saying:--         \"The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:          I bear up the pillars of it.\"    Yet again, just as we speak of \"the celestial canopy,\" so Psalm civ.  describes the Lord as He \"who stretchest out the heavens like a  curtain,\" and Isaiah gives the image in a fuller form,--\"that stretcheth  out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell  in.\" The same expression of \"stretching out the heavens\" is repeatedly  used in Isaiah; it is indeed one of his typical phrases. Here, beyond  question, extension, spreading out, is the idea sought to be conveyed,  not that of solidity.    The prophet Amos uses yet another parallel. \"It is He that buildeth His  stories in the heaven.\" While Isaiah speaks of the entire stellar  universe as the tent or pavilion of Jehovah, Amos likens the height of  the heavens as the steps up to His throne; the \"stories\" are the  \"ascent,\" as Moses speaks of the \"ascent of Akrabbim,\" and David makes  \"the ascent\" of the Mount of Olives. The Hebrews cannot have regarded  the heavens as, literally, both staircase and reservoir.    The firmament, _i. e._ the atmosphere, is spoken of as dividing between  the waters that are under the firmament, _i. e._ oceans, seas, rivers,  etc., from the waters that are above the firmament, _i. e._ the masses  of water vapour carried by the atmosphere, seen in the clouds, and  condensing from them as rain. We get the very same expression as this of  the \"waters which were above\" in the Psalm of Praise:--         \"Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens,       And ye waters that be above the heavens;\"    and again in the Song of the Three Children:--         \"O all ye waters that be above the heaven, bless ye the Lord.\"    In the later books of the Bible the subject of the circulation of water  through the atmosphere is referred to much more fully. Twice over the  prophet Amos describes Jehovah as \"He that calleth for the waters of the  sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth.\" This is not  merely a reference to the tides, for the Preacher in the book of  Ecclesiastes expressly points out that \"all the rivers run into the sea,  yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come,  thither they return again\"; and Isaiah seems to employ something of the  same thought:         \"For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and       returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it       bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to       the eater.\"    Schiaparelli indeed argues that this very passage from Isaiah \"expressly  excludes any idea of an atmospheric circulation of waters\"[41:1] on the  ground that the water so falling is thought to be transmuted into seeds  and fruits. But surely the image is as true as it is beautiful! The rain  is absorbed by vegetation, and is transmuted into seeds and fruit, and  it would go hard to say that the same particles of rain are again  evaporated and taken up afresh into the clouds. Besides, if we complete  the quotation we find that what is stated is that the rain does not  return _until_ it has accomplished its purpose:--         \"So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it       shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that       which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I       sent it.\"    Elihu describes the process of evaporation precisely:-"]]]
