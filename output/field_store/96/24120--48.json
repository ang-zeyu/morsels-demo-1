This fluid is used likewise in situations and experiments in which  mercury would be frozen; for mercury becomes a solid body, like a piece  of lead or any other metal, at a certain degree of cold: but no degree  of cold has ever been known to freeze spirit of wine.    A thermometer, therefore, consists of a tube with a bulb, such as you  see here, containing a fluid whose degrees of dilatation and contraction  are indicated by a scale to which the tube is fixed. The degree which  indicates the boiling point, simply means that, when the fluid is  sufficiently dilated to rise to this point, the heat is such that water  exposed to the same temperature will boil. When, on the other hand, the  fluid is so much condensed as to sink to the freezing point, we know  that water will freeze at that temperature. The extreme points of the  scales are not the same in all thermometers, nor are the degrees always  divided in the same manner. In different countries philosophers have  chosen to adopt different scales and divisions. The two thermometers  most used are those of Fahrenheit, and of Reaumur; the first is  generally preferred by the English, the latter by the French.    EMILY.    The variety of scale must be very inconvenient, and I should think  liable to occasion confusion, when French and English experiments are  compared.    MRS. B.    The inconvenience is but very trifling, because the different gradations  of the scales do not affect the principle upon which thermometers are  constructed. When we know, for instance, that Fahrenheit's scale is  divided into 212 degrees, in which 32 deg. corresponds with the freezing  point, and 212 deg. with the point of boiling water: and that Reaumur's is  divided only into 80 degrees, in which 0 deg. denotes the freezing point,  and 80 deg. that of boiling water, it is easy to compare the two scales  together, and reduce the one into the other. But, for greater  convenience, thermometers are sometimes constructed with both these  scales, one on either side of the tube; so that the correspondence of  the different degrees of the two scales is thus instantly seen. Here  is one of these scales, (PLATE II. Fig. 1.) by which you can at  once perceive that each degree of Reaumur's corresponds to 2-1/4 of  Fahrenheit's division. But I believe the French have, of late, given  the preference to what they call the centigrade scale, in which the  space between the freezing and the boiling point is divided into 100  degrees.      [Illustration: Plate II. Vol. I. p. 42.      Fig. 1. Thermometer.    Fahrenheit's Scale.    Reaumur's Scale.    Boiling point of Water    Freezing point of Water      Fig. 2. Differential Thermometer.]    CAROLINE.    That seems to me the most reasonable division, and I cannot guess  why the freezing point is called 32 deg., or what advantage is derived  from it.    MRS. B.    There really is no advantage in it; and it originated in a mistaken  opinion of the instrument-maker, Fahrenheit, who first constructed these  thermometers. He mixed snow and salt together, and produced by that  means a degree of cold which he concluded was the greatest possible, and  therefore made his scale begin from that point. Between that and boiling  water he made 212 degrees, and the freezing point was found to be at  32 deg.    EMILY.    Are spirit of wine, and mercury, the only liquids used in the  construction of thermometers?    MRS. B.    I believe they are the only liquids now in use, though some others, such  as linseed oil, would make tolerable thermometers: but for experiments  in which a very quick and delicate test of the changes of temperature is  required, air is the fluid sometimes employed. The bulb of air  thermometers is filled with common air only, and its expansion and  contraction are indicated by a small drop of any coloured liquor, which  is suspended within the tube, and moves up and down, according as the  air within the bulb and tube expands or contracts. But in general, air  thermometers, however sensible to changes of temperature, are by no  means accurate in their indications.    I can, however, show you an air thermometer of a very peculiar  construction, which is remarkably well adapted for some chemical  experiments, as it is equally delicate and accurate in its indications.    CAROLINE.    It looks like a double thermometer reversed, the tube being bent, and  having a large bulb at each of its extremities. (PLATE II. Fig. 2.)    EMILY.    Why do you call it an air thermometer; the tube contains a coloured  liquid?    MRS. B.    But observe that the bulbs are filled with air, the liquid being  confined to a portion of the tube, and answering only the purpose of  showing, by its motion in the tube, the comparative dilatation or  contraction of the air within the bulbs, which afford an indication of  their relative temperature. Thus if you heat the bulb A, by the warmth  of your hand, the fluid will rise towards the bulb B, and the contrary  will happen if you reverse the experiment.    But if, on the contrary, both tubes are of the same temperature, as is  the case now, the coloured liquid, suffering an equal pressure on each  side, no change of level takes place.    CAROLINE.    This instrument appears, indeed, uncommonly delicate. The fluid is set  in motion by the mere approach of my hand.    MRS. B.    You must observe, however, that this thermometer cannot indicate the  temperature of any particular body, or of the medium in which it is  immersed; it serves only to point out the _difference_ of temperature  between the two bulbs, when placed under different circumstances. For  this reason it has been called _differential_ thermometer. You will see  by-and-bye to what particular purposes this instrument applies.    EMILY.    But do common thermometers indicate the exact quantity of caloric  contained either in the atmosphere, or in any body with which they are  in contact?    MRS. B.    No: first, because there are other modifications of caloric which do not  affect the thermometer; and, secondly, because the temperature of a  body, as indicated by the thermometer, is only relative. When, for  instance, the thermometer remains stationary at the freezing point, we  know that the atmosphere (or medium in which it is placed, whatever it  may be) is as cold as freezing water; and when it stands at the boiling  point, we know that this medium is as hot as boiling water; but we do  not know the positive quantity of heat contained either in freezing or  boiling water, any more than we know the real extremes of heat and cold;  and consequently we cannot determine that of the body in which the  thermometer is placed.    CAROLINE.    I do not quite understand this explanation.    MRS. B.    Let us compare a thermometer to a well, in which the water rises to  different heights, according as it is more or less supplied by the  spring which feeds it: if the depth of the well is unfathomable, it must  be impossible to know the absolute quantity of water it contains; yet we  can with the greatest accuracy measure the number of feet the water has  risen or fallen in the well at any time, and consequently know the  precise quantity of its increase or diminution, without having the least  knowledge of the whole quantity of water it contains.    CAROLINE.    Now I comprehend it very well; nothing appears to me to explain a thing  so clearly as a comparison.    EMILY.    But will thermometers bear any degree of heat?    MRS. B.    No; for if the temperature were much above the highest degree marked on  the scale of the thermometer, the mercury would burst the tube in an  attempt to ascend. And at any rate, no thermometer can be applied to  temperatures higher than the boiling point of the liquid used in its  construction, for the steam, on the liquid beginning to boil, would  burst the tube. In furnaces, or whenever any very high temperature is to  be measured, a pyrometer, invented by Wedgwood, is used for that  purpose. It is made of a certain composition of baked clay, which has  the peculiar property of contracting by heat, so that the degree of  contraction of this substance indicates the temperature to which it has  been exposed.    EMILY.    But is it possible for a body to contract by heat? I thought that heat  dilated all bodies whatever.    MRS. B.    This is not an exception to the rule. You must recollect that the bulk  of the clay is not compared, whilst hot, with that which it has when  cold; but it is from the change which the clay has undergone by _having  been_ heated that the indications of this instrument are derived. This  change consists in a beginning fusion which tends to unite the particles  of clay more closely, thus rendering it less pervious or spongy.    Clay is to be considered as a spongy body, having many interstices or  pores, from its having contained water when soft. These interstices are  by heat lessened, and would by extreme heat be entirely obliterated.    CAROLINE.    And how do you ascertain the degrees of contraction of Wedgwood's  pyrometer?    MRS. B.    The dimensions of a piece of clay are measured by a scale graduated on  the side of a tapered groove, formed in a brass ruler; the more the clay  is contracted by the heat, the further it will descend into the narrow  part of the tube.    Before we quit the subject of expansion, I must observe to you that, as  liquids expand more readily than solids, so elastic fluids, whether air  or vapour, are the most expansible of all bodies.    It may appear extraordinary that all elastic fluids whatever, undergo  the same degree of expansion from equal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],[0,"Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#8)"],[1,"t, causes, and incidence of the problem of  delinquency in this Dominion. We think that this must be done before  any thorough-going solutions can be propounded for consideration by  Government.    VI. That the suggestions made by the Department of Justice with respect  to \"comics\" in general and \"crime comics\" in particular and also with  regard to \"suggestive\" magazines and periodicals appeal very strongly  to the members of the present Committee, and we accordingly recommend  that the Government should take action along the lines proposed by the  Justice Department.    VII. That every effort be made through the Parent-Teacher and Home and  School Associations to reach the greatest possible number of parents  and prospective parents in order that they might be given the type of  assistance referred to in greater detail in the body of this report.    VIII. That, for the better attainment of the object set out in the  preceding paragraph, it is recommended that the Director of Education  be asked to confer with appropriate experts with a view to the  provision of suitable courses of lectures for parents and prospective  parents.    That with the same end in view steps should be taken to increase the  numbers of our visiting teachers, school psychologists, and public  health nurses.    IX. That the Director of the National Broadcasting Service be supported  in the course he proposes to follow to put into effect the suggestions  made by him in this report. We also stress our view that during the  hours set apart for listening by children there should be a complete  absence of features that can fairly be regarded as being unsuitable for  or injurious to young children.    X. That on the question of contraceptives the Committee has but one  recommendation to make--namely, that the Government should seriously  consider whether it could be made a criminal offence for any one but a  chemist acting in the ordinary course of his business to sell such  articles to any member of the general public.
