I challenge you to do it. Just give us one, long or short,  from any chapter in all the Bible. The man failed. He couldn't do it.  Then, said the Christian gentleman, you fellows are always talking about  science and about the \"unscientific character of the Bible,\" so I will  now ask you one of the most simple questions known in science, and we  will see whether you will answer it. It is this: How many teeth have you  got in your mouth; how many does a man have? To the utter astonishment  of the company the man failed again, and the company told him laughingly  that he must treat to the cigars. Such fellows know comparatively  nothing, and yet they are always championing their men, who contain all  their knowledge and do their thinking for them. Ask the infidel who his  leaders are and he will point you to Hume, Voltaire, Thomas Paine, etc.  Are Christians always holding up their great minds? Suppose we test the  merits of the case in this manner, then who are your infidels that will  compare with Jesus Christ and his apostles? or, with such men, even, as  Milton, Clarendon, Hale, Bacon, Boyle, Locke, Newton, Addison,  Lyttleton, West, Johnson and Campbell? Where are your persons of such  profound understanding? To compare such persons as these with Voltaire,  Hume, Gibbon and Thomas Paine, is as silly as to compare manhood with  infancy. No infidels try Christianity upon its own merits. If they were  candid men they would separate Christianity from all foreign and  irrelative circumstances, and test its evidences seriously, as the  magnitude of the question deserves. Apply the same unbelief to the  common and ancient records of history and you will at once get the  credit of being rash and foolish. The scoffs and sarcasms and  sophistries of infidels are not from a love of truth. Whatever the cause  or causes may be, one thing is certain, and that is, that they do not  understand Christianity itself, nor the nature and magnitude of its  evidences. They condemn that which they never gave themselves the  trouble to investigate.    Whoever investigates the religion of Jesus Christ will find that the  character of its founder is far superior to any other character, and his  apostles far superior to any other fishermen. To believe that his  religion is of simple human origin is like believing that a first-class  ship of war is the invention of a child. \"The majesty of Christ and the  divinity of his religion appears in nothing more than this, that in  proportion to our acquaintance with the Scriptures of the New Testament  does the light of truth shine upon the mind.\" The seeming successes of  infidelity, and the multitude of apostates scattered over our country,  makes us naturally more anxious to warn the rising generation against  the errors of those who would mislead them. But there is nothing in  these fearful signs of the times to shake our faith or excite our  fears, because the faithful Bible student finds the condition of our  world just such as the Scriptures have foretold. All the surroundings  that characterize the conduct of infidels; their expertness in ridicule;  their extreme folly and resoluteness; their licentiousness and anxiety  for change in laws as well as society; the snares laid out by them to  catch the unsteadfast, and their vain professions to free the world from  slavery, while they themselves are in bondage to corruption, are drawn  by the divine pencil of prophecy with so much exactness that \"he who  runs may read.\" By examining the word of God you will find that the  _Free-thinkers_ of our country, the _Illuminati_ of Germany, Darwin,  Strauss, Huxley, Tyndal, Renan, and the man of our own land who is most  noted in our midst for oratorical accomplishments without logic,  argument or truthfulness of statements touching the Christian religion,  are all present evidences of the divinity of the prophetic words of the  New Testament.          WOMAN AND HER RANK.      I presume that Adam knew nothing of the subject of woman's inferiority.  I do not think that he ever said to Eve, Don't soar so high nor dive so  deep into philosophy, science and religion, because you are a woman. I  don't think he ever said to his wife, Astronomy is beyond your reach,  nor Science is too deep for your slender powers.    Home is a woman's empire, but this very fact demands that her  intellectual powers should not be inferior to her husband's. A vast  majority of people have their minds influenced and their characters  formed by their mothers. Foolish and silly, as well as lazy women  generally, have their counterparts in their offspring. By following the  outlines of nature in her facts we have become scientific, and all the  wisdom we can get from this source will be still more advantageous. The  woman's physical nature should ever teach us that she is not to be taxed  with physical labor beyond her strength and sphere of life. Such  taxation is barbarism and savageness. This heathenism always _destroys  home_. The American Indian has no home; he lives an idle, lazy,  good-for-nothing life, while his wife, or woman, as the case may be,  does all the drudgery. For this _very reason_ he was never elevated, as  a general rule, above a shot-gun and a hound dog, and never had a home  superior to Doolittle's birth-place, which, he said, was \"at Cape Cod,  Nantucket, and all along up and down the shore.\"    It is said that the English is the only language in which the word  \"home\" occurs. What infamous hours many bachelors keep; many of them die  of dissipation because they have no mother, sister, or wife to look  after them and render their homes pleasant and attractive. What an odd  looking thing a house is without a female occupant. \"Won't you tarry  awhile?\" \"Can't you stay awhile?\" \"O, don't be in a hurry.\" Such is  often heard, and the reply is, \"No, I am much obliged to you, I must go,  for my mother, my sister, or my wife, is expecting me.\" But for these  sentiments he would stay until midnight; so some unmarried men are the  most contemptible _bores_. When you get acquainted with them you  naturally hate to see them coming. Some married men fall into the same  way of _boring_ their neighbors. When I see a man doing this I suspect  that he has lost his love of home associations, and ask myself the  question, What is the trouble?    There is always an adequate cause for every effect. Modern \"Freeloveism\"  looks to the annihilation of home, for the reason that it proposes no  definite home for male or female. No people destitute of the light of  the Bible ever possessed a home, such an one as ours.    One of the great abominations of infidelity is often met within the  advocacy of _Freeloveism_, and matrimony binding at the option, simply,  of the parties. What is a vagabond on the earth but a man without a  home? Slaves have been the same in every age, and a government that does  everything for its subjects will always keep them in degradation. A  father and mother who would not effectually ruin their children must not  raise them in indolence and affluence, doing everything for them and  teaching them nothing in a practical way; even so a woman must be  elevated until her post is one of honor. You might as well tie a man  hand and foot, and command him to run a race, as to deprive women or  others of their natural rights, and then expect them to rise or progress  the same as those who are in the full possession of all their liberties.  Give to all freedom and scope for their talents, and allow them to rise  or fall at pleasure, but ever point them upward and onward.    Women were slaves in Egypt, in Babylon, in Ninevah, in Persia, in Greece  and Rome, and all those nations _sunk_. She is now a slave in China, in  India and in Turkey.    Adam said: \"She is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; she shall be  called woman for she was taken from man. Therefore shall a man leave his  father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be  one flesh.\"    Say what you will of gallantry, and of the flattery of the sex, but here  you have the intelligent and affectionate language of the first man,  which, for beauty and love, as well as simplicity, has never been  surpassed. \"She is bone of my bone,\" and consequently of my own rank. We  are one. She is flesh of my flesh and therefore is my equal. \"She shall  be called woman,\" that is, a female man.    It is authoritatively asserted that the Hebrew term translated woman  signifies a female man, just as in Latin \"equa\" is the feminine of  \"equus,\" \"Julia\" is the feminine of \"Julius.\" But if she was a female  man she possessed all the attributes of humanity, and therefore her  dignity was and is the same as the other sex. Adam gave to Eve a  position, an honorable position, for he took her in as a part of  himself. His honor was her honor, his rank was her rank, and she was his  helpmeet. My ideal woman is not one who is good for nothing, \"bred only  and polished to the taste of lustful appetence; to sing, to dance, to  dress, to troll the tongue and roll the eye.\" She should be a helpmeet  as termed in the Bible. She should be a creature not too bright and good  to labor in her proper sphere, that is, to prepare daily food, serve it  up and guide the house. A high legal dignitary placed an epitaph upon  the tomb of his wife, that read: \"An excellent woman and a good cook.\"    When a stout, able-bodied woman sits herself down and whines out, \"I  can't work,\" she gets down very low. What is such a woman good for?    It has been said that woman is man's imaginative side. Well, I imagine  that there is a great deal of truth in the remark so far as many men are  concerned,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28677"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#8)"],[1,"us,  his messenger on earth, who taught the wicked to repent of the error of  their ways and that God was ever ready to receive them. Forms and  ordinances, parade and show, are no points of his system, but virtue and  purity of heart can alone prepare man for a blissful existence beyond  the grave, the wisdom and hope of which were furnished by the  resurrection of the teacher of their faith, _a member of earth and an  heir of immortality_.\"--Free-thinking Christians' Magazine; Hannah  Adams's Dictionary of all Religions, page 82.      REMARKS.    The above dictionary is in my possession. It was published in 1817 by  James Eastburn & Company at the literary rooms, corner of Broadway and  Pine streets, New York, and by Cummings and Hilliard, No. 1 Cornhill,  Boston. The author credits the above article to the above-named  magazine, so we may rely upon it as the freethinker's own presentation  of his theory in its early history. It will be of great interest to all  our readers, as it will enable them to see, at once, the origin of  so-called free-thought. It had its origin with Calvinistic errors upon  the subject of the Trinity, a vicarious atonement, and kindred ideas  concerning human redemption. It will be of interest also to mark the  improvements (?) of free-thinkers, who are always boasting of being in  the advance guard in warring with error and ignorance.    They had neither singing nor prayers when they started out, and in these  regards they have not apostatized from their first faith, for they are  up to this time a praiseless and prayerless people, never praying unless  it is when they have the cramp or some other disease. Their wants seem  to be few and easily supplied. Health and hominy are the staples of  spiritual food with them at the present. The time was when, as a  society, they wished to wear some of the main elements of the Christian  religion, such as belief in the existence of God; the existence of the  church of God, and belief in the resurrection of Christ, and through him  the resurrection of all men; but they have long ere this thrown aside  all these. In the beginning of their history they were noted, as our  author says, for their disposition to promptly \"controvert the current  doctrines of the Christian world,\" and \"show their dissent from all  sects and parties, and their aversion to the clergy, and to Christian  ministers of all denominations.\" This trait of character they still  retain, regardless of the advance of Christians from Calvinistic errors.  This looks like they were determined on hating the profession of  Christianity, regardless of its character. _Such_ is their chronic  disease.    They talk no more of worshiping the eternal God, nor of obeying the  commands of Jesus. But it is just to say of their most noted leaders  that they confess that the _Christ life_ was, and is, the most exalted  and praiseworthy life of all the ages. And, while this life remains to  challenge the world to imitation, we Christians shall rejoice, believing  in Christ and realizing that our foundation stands sure and secure. In  their origin they built a fine church house, but now they go to China  and borrow \"Josh house,\" as an odius epithet for church house,  forgetting that their China brethren are simply clinging to their own  old philosophy of nature and her lessons, without the religion of the  Bible; and, also, forgetting that they, themselves, allow that all that  is, is right, being, from natural selection, simply the survival of the  fittest. Eight years more and a century will have passed since free  thought started out in Parliament Court Chapel, and from present  indications we are inclined to think that all men will be under the  necessity of conceding that Christianity is the _fittest_, for it  stoutly refuses to die.    In their beginning they repudiated the idea of the inspiration of the  Bible; to this they have held without change. Further than this, they  acknowledged that the Bible was an authentic history, but now they  calumniate the idea, and blaspheme the Bible and its God. In these  respects they have grown backwards; and they no longer claim to \"worship  one God, eternal, just and good,\" nor to \"obey the commands of Jesus,\"  \"rejecting sacraments, forms, ordinances, parade and show, along with  song and prayer.\" Perhaps they cast up their accounts, and found that  there could, in the very nature of things, be no worship outside of all  these elements of worship, and then determined to be more honest at  least, and endeavor in the future to people the earth with a  non-worshipping, Godless, Christless, praiseless, prayerless, non-hoping  set of inhabitants, who would give all up in death for the sake of free  thought.          WHAT A MAN MAY BE AND BE A CHRISTIAN IN THE ESTIMATION OF COL.  INGERSOLL.      We find the following in the Colonel's speech, which was delivered at  Rockford, Ill., on Tuesday, October 5, 1880. We publish it in order to  show the utter fallacy of the infidel's claim that Christianity is  necessarily in conflict with education; that Christians are necessarily  bigots, narrow-minded men, dangerous to the liberty of man, woman and  child. Read it, ye fault-finding skeptics and infidels, and save your  claims against the Christian religion if you can. Correllate it with  the hollow utterances of Colonel Ingersoll, which are so often repeated  by him in other addresses directed wholly against Christianity, if you  can. Here it is:         \"I have known him (Garfield) for years. I know him as well as I       know any other man, and I tell you he has more brains, more       education, wider and more splendid views than any other man who has       been nominated for the Presidency by any party since I was born.       Some people say to me: 'How can you vote for Garfield when he is a       Christian and was a preacher?' I tell them: 'I have two reasons:       One is, I am not a bigot, and the other is, General Garfield is not       a bigot. He does not agree with me; I do not agree with him on       thousands of things; _but on the great luminous principle that       every man must give to every other man every right that he claims       for himself we do absolutely agree._' [Italics mine.--ED.] I would       despise myself if I would vote against a man in politics simply       because we differed about what is known as religion. I will vote       for a liberal Catholic, a liberal Presbyterian, a liberal       Methodist, a liberal anything ten thousand times quicker than I       would vote for an illiberal free-thinker. I believe in the right. I       believe in doing to other people in these matters as I would like       them to do to me. _General Garfield is an honest man every way;       intellectual every way._ He is a poor man; he is rich in honor, in       integrity he is wealthy, and in brains he is a millionaire. * * *       He is a great, good, broad, kind, tender man, and he will do, if       elected President, what he believes to be right.\"      SUM OF POSSIBILITIES.    1. It is possible for an honest man to be the best educated man in the  nation, and at the same time be a Christian.    2. It is possible for the millionaire in brains to be the best educated  man in the nation, and at the same time be a Christian.    3. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and not be a bigot.    4. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and an advocate of the  great luminous principle that every man must give to every other man  every right that he claims for himself.    5. It is possible for a man to be a Christian and be a liberal man.    6. It is possible for a man to be honest every way, and be a Christian.    7. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and be every way an  intellectual man.    8. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and be rich in honor.    9. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and be wealthy in  integrity.    10. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and be a great man.    11. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and be a good man.    12. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and be a broad, kind,  tender man.    13. It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and have wider and more  splendid views than any other man.    And Colonel Ingersoll says he knows all this to be so. Now what shall we  think of the utterances of lesser lights in infidelity since we have the  living fact before us that Christianity is in perfect harmony with the  very highest education; with the widest and most splendid views; with  honesty every way; with greatness; with goodness; with integrity; with  honor; with kindness and tenderness; with the great luminous principle  that a man must give to every other man every right that he claims for  himself? And it is also in perfect harmony with a great and _liberal  heart_.    We have hope that Colonel Ingersoll will yet find his way into the  temple of truth, which reveals the glory and grandeur of the perfect  harmony that exists between Christianity and all that is truly great and  good--since he has pronounced the word \"Eureka.\"          LIFE AND FORCE ARE NOT THE SAME.      Hylozoism is the doctrine that life and matter are inseparable. This  doctrine has been presented in several different forms. Straton, of  Lampsacus, claimed that molecules were each and all of them in  possession of life. The Stoics did not, however, accord life to each and  every distinct particle of matter, but held that the universe, as a  whole, was a being animated by a principle which gave to it motion, form  and life. This principle they called the soul of the universe. This idea  was advocated by the followers of Plotinus, who contended that this soul  of the world animated the smallest particle of matter. Spinoza asserted  that all things were alive in different degrees. Matter, according to  Leibnitz and Boscovish, and others, is always endowed with force.  Attraction and"]]]
