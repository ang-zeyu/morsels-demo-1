The tank, a  galvanized-iron ash-can, is provided with a conical top, through an  opening in which a funnel is placed. The diagram shows the water leaving  the calorimeter and entering the meter through this funnel, but in  practice it is adjusted to enter through an opening on the side of the  meter. After the valve _f_ is tightly closed the empty can is weighed.    When the experiment proper begins the water-current is deflected so as  to run into this can and at the end of an hour the water is deflected  into a small can used for measuring the rate of flow. While it is  running into this can, the large can G is weighed on platform scales to  within 10 grams. After weighing, the water is again deflected into the  large can and that collected in the small measuring can is poured into G  through the funnel. The can holds about 100 liters of water and  consequently from 3 to 8 one-hour periods, depending upon the rate of  flow, can be continued without emptying the meter. When it is desired to  empty the meter at the end of the period, the water is allowed to flow  into the small can, and after weighing G, the valve _f_ is opened. About  4 minutes are required to empty the large can. After this the valve is  again closed, the empty can weighed, and the water in the small  measuring-can poured into the large can G through the funnel. The scales  used are the so-called silk scales and are listed by the manufacturers  to weigh 150 kilograms. This form of scales was formerly used in  weighing the man inside the chamber.[7]      THERMOMETERS.    In connection with the calorimeter and the accessories, mercurial and  electric-resistance thermometers are employed. For measuring the  temperature of the water as it enters and leaves the chamber through  horizontal tubes, mercurial thermometers are used, and these are  supplemented by electric-resistance thermometers which are connected  with a special form of recording instrument for permanently recording  the temperature differences. For the measurement of the temperatures  inside of the calorimeter, two sets of electric-resistance thermometers  are used, one of which is a series of open coils of wire suspended in  the air of the chamber so as to take up quickly the temperature of the  air. The other set consists of resistance coils encased in copper boxes  soldered to the copper wall and are designed to indicate the temperature  of the copper wall rather than that of the air.      MERCURIAL THERMOMETERS.    The mercurial thermometers used for measuring the temperature  differences of the water-current are of special construction and have  been calibrated with the greatest accuracy. As the water enters the  respiration chamber through a horizontal tube, the thermometers are so  constructed and so placed in the horizontal tubes through which the  water passes that the bulbs of the thermometers lie about in a plane  with the copper wall, thus taking the temperature of the water  immediately as it enters and as it leaves the chamber. For convenience  in reading, the stem of the thermometer is bent at right angles and the  graduations are placed on the upright part.    The thermometers are graduated from 0 deg. to 12 deg. C. or from 8 deg. to  20 deg. C. and each degree is divided into fiftieths. Without the use of a  lens it is possible to read accurately to the hundredth of a degree. For  calibrating these thermometers a special arrangement is necessary. The  standards used consist of well-constructed metastatic thermometers of  the Beckmann type, made by C. Richter, of Berlin, and calibrated by the  Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt. Furthermore, a standard  thermometer, graduated from 14 deg. to 24 deg. C., also made by Richter  and standardized by the Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt, serves  as a basis for securing the absolute temperature. Since, however, on the  mercurial thermometers used in the water-current, differences in  temperature are required rather than absolute temperatures, it is  unnecessary, except in an approximate way, to standardize the  thermometers on the basis of absolute temperature. For calibrating the  thermometers, an ordinary wooden water-pail is provided with several  holes in the side near the bottom. One-hole rubber stoppers are inserted  in these holes and through these are placed the bulbs and stems of the  different thermometers which are to be calibrated. The upright portion  of the stem is held in a vertical position by a clamp. The pail is  filled with water, thereby insuring a large mass of water and slow  temperature fluctuations, and the water is stirred by means of an  electrically driven turbine stirrer.    The Beckmann thermometers, of which two are used, are so adjusted that  they overlap each other and thus allow a range of 8 deg. to 14 deg. C.  without resetting. For all temperatures above 14 deg. C., the standard  Richter thermometer can be used directly. For temperatures at 8 deg. C.  or below, a large funnel filled with cracked ice is placed with the stem  dipping into the water. As the ice melts, the cooling effect on the large  mass of water is sufficient to maintain the temperature constant and  compensate the heating effect of the surrounding room-air. The  thermometers are tapped and read as nearly simultaneously as possible. A  number of readings are taken at each point and the average readings used  in the calculations. Making due allowance for the corrections on the  Beckmann thermometers, the temperature differences can be determined to  less than 0.01 deg. C. The data obtained from the calibrations are  therefore used for comparison and a table of corrections is prepared for  each set of thermometers used. It is especially important that these  thermometers be compared among themselves with great accuracy, since as  used in the calorimeter the temperature of the ingoing water is measured  on one thermometer and the temperature of the outgoing water on another.    Thermometers of this type are extremely fragile. The long angle with an  arm some 35 centimeters in length makes it difficult to handle them  without breakage, but they are extremely sensitive and accurate and have  given great satisfaction. The construction of the bulb is such, however,  that the slightest pressure on it raises the column of mercury very  perceptibly, and hence it is important in practical use to note the  influence of the pressure of the water upon the bulbs and make  corrections therefor. The influence of such pressure upon thermometers  used in an apparatus of this type was first pointed out by Armsby,[8]  and with high rates of flow, amounting to 1 liter or more per minute,  there may be a correction on these thermometers amounting to several  hundredths of a degree. We have found that, as installed at present,  with a rate of flow of less than 400 cubic centimeters per minute, there  is no correction for water pressure.    In installing a thermometer it is of the greatest importance that there  be no pressure against the side of the tube through which the  thermometer is inserted. The slightest pressure will cause considerable  rise in the mercury column. Special precautions must also be taken to  insulate the tube through which the water passes, as the passage of the  water along the tube does not insure ordinarily a thorough mixing, and  by moving the thermometer bulb from the center of the tube to a point  near the edge, the water, which at the edge may be somewhat warmer than  at the center, immediately affects the thermometer. By use of the vacuum  jacket mentioned above, this warming of the water has been avoided, and  in electric-resistance thermometers special precautions are taken not  only with regard to the relative position of the bulb of the mercury  thermometer and the resistance thermometer, but also with regard to the  hard-rubber insulation, to avoid errors of this nature.      ELECTRIC-RESISTANCE THERMOMETERS.    Electric-resistance thermometers are used in connection with the  respiration calorimeter for several purposes: first, to determine the  fluctuations in the temperature of the air inside the chamber; second,  to measure the fluctuations of the temperature of the copper wall of the  respiration chamber; third, for determining the variations in body  temperature; finally, for recording the differences in temperature of  the incoming and outgoing water. While these thermometers are all built  on the same principle, their installation is very different, and a word  regarding the method of using each is necessary.      AIR THERMOMETERS.    The air thermometers are designed with a special view to taking quickly  the temperature of the air. Five thermometers, each having a resistance  of not far from 4 ohms, are connected in series and suspended 3.5  centimeters from the wall on hooks inside the chamber. They are  surrounded for protection, first, with a perforated metal cylinder, and  outside this with a wire guard.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Detail of air-resistance thermometer, showing  method of mounting and wiring the thermometer. Parts of the wire guard  and brass guard are shown, cut away so that interior structure can be  seen.]    The details of construction and method of installation are shown in fig.  15. Four strips of mica are inserted into four slots in a hard maple rod  12.5 centimeters long and 12 millimeters in diameter, and around each  strip is wound 5 meters of double silk-covered pure copper wire  (wire-gage No. 30). By means of heavy connecting wires, five of these  thermometers are connected in series, giving a total resistance of the  system of not far from 20 ohms. The thermometer proper is suspended  between two hooks by rubber bands and these two hooks are in turn  fastened to a wire guard which is attached to threaded rods soldered to  the inner surface of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28233"],[0,"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (#8)"],[1,"ultima.
