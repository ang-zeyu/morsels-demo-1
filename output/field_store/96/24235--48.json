[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32032"],[0,"Second Variety (#8)"],[1,"he killed Rudi.\"    Hendricks sat down again slowly. He shook his head. He was numb. He  could not think.    \"Do you see?\" Tasso said. \"Do you understand?\"    Hendricks said nothing. Everything was slipping away from him, faster  and faster. Darkness, rolling and plucking at him.    He closed his eyes.           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks opened his eyes slowly. His body ached all over. He tried to  sit up but needles of pain shot through his arm and shoulder. He  gasped.    \"Don't try to get up,\" Tasso said. She bent down, putting her cold  hand against his forehead.    It was night. A few stars glinted above, shining through the drifting  clouds of ash. Hendricks lay back, his teeth locked. Tasso watched him  impassively. She had built a fire with some wood and weeds. The fire  licked feebly, hissing at a metal cup suspended over it. Everything  was silent. Unmoving darkness, beyond the fire.    \"So he was the Second Variety,\" Hendricks murmured.    \"I had always thought so.\"    \"Why didn't you destroy him sooner?\" he wanted to know.    \"You held me back.\" Tasso crossed to the fire to look into the metal  cup. \"Coffee. It'll be ready to drink in awhile.\"    She came back and sat down beside him. Presently she opened her pistol  and began to disassemble the firing mechanism, studying it intently.    \"This is a beautiful gun,\" Tasso said, half-aloud. \"The construction  is superb.\"    \"What about them? The claws.\"    \"The concussion from the bomb put most of them out of action. They're  delicate. Highly organized, I suppose.\"    \"The Davids, too?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How did you happen to have a bomb like that?\"    Tasso shrugged. \"We designed it. You shouldn't underestimate our  technology, Major. Without such a bomb you and I would no longer  exist.\"    \"Very useful.\"    Tasso stretched out her legs, warming her feet in the heat of the  fire. \"It surprised me that you did not seem to understand, after he  killed Rudi. Why did you think he--\"    \"I told you. I thought he was afraid.\"    \"Really? You know, Major, for a little while I suspected you. Because  you wouldn't let me kill him. I thought you might be protecting him.\"  She laughed.    \"Are we safe here?\" Hendricks asked presently.    \"For awhile. Until they get reinforcements from some other area.\"  Tasso began to clean the interior of the gun with a bit of rag. She  finished and pushed the mechanism back into place. She closed the gun,  running her finger along the barrel.    \"We were lucky,\" Hendricks murmured.    \"Yes. Very lucky.\"    \"Thanks for pulling me away.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tasso did not answer. She glanced up at him, her eyes bright in the  fire light. Hendricks examined his arm. He could not move his fingers.  His whole side seemed numb. Down inside him was a dull steady ache.    \"How do you feel?\" Tasso asked.    \"My arm is damaged.\"    \"Anything else?\"    \"Internal injuries.\"    \"You didn't get down when the bomb went off.\"    Hendricks said nothing. He watched Tasso pour the coffee from the cup  into a flat metal pan. She brought it over to him.    \"Thanks.\" He struggled up enough to drink. It was hard to swallow. His  insides turned over and he pushed the pan away. \"That's all I can  drink now.\"    Tasso drank the rest. Time passed. The clouds of ash moved across the  dark sky above them. Hendricks rested, his mind blank. After awhile he  became aware that Tasso was standing over him, gazing down at him.    \"What is it?\" he murmured.    \"Do you feel any better?\"    \"Some.\"    \"You know, Major, if I hadn't dragged you away they would have got  you. You would be dead. Like Rudi.\"    \"I know.\"    \"Do you want to know why I brought you out? I could have left you. I  could have left you there.\"    \"Why did you bring me out?\"    \"Because we have to get away from here.\" Tasso stirred the fire with a  stick, peering calmly down into it. \"No human being can live here.  When their reinforcements come we won't have a chance. I've pondered  about it while you were unconscious. We have perhaps three hours  before they come.\"    \"And you expect me to get us away?\"    \"That's right. I expect you to get us out of here.\"    \"Why me?\"    \"Because I don't know any way.\" Her eyes shone at him in the  half-light, bright and steady. \"If you can't get us out of here  they'll kill us within three hours. I see nothing else ahead. Well,  Major? What are you going to do? I've been waiting all night. While  you were unconscious I sat here, waiting and listening. It's almost  dawn. The night is almost over.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks considered. \"It's curious,\" he said at last.    \"Curious?\"    \"That you should think I can get us out of here. I wonder what you  think I can do.\"    \"Can you get us to the Moon Base?\"    \"The Moon Base? How?\"    \"There must be some way.\"    Hendricks shook his head. \"No. There's no way that I know of.\"    Tasso said nothing. For a moment her steady gaze wavered. She ducked  her head, turning abruptly away. She scrambled to her feet. \"More  coffee?\"    \"No.\"    \"Suit yourself.\" Tasso drank silently. He could not see her face. He  lay back against the ground, deep in thought, trying to concentrate.  It was hard to think. His head still hurt. And the numbing daze still  hung over him.    \"There might be one way,\" he said suddenly.    \"Oh?\"    \"How soon is dawn?\"    \"Two hours. The sun will be coming up shortly.\"    \"There's supposed to be a ship near here. I've never seen it. But I  know it exists.\"    \"What kind of a ship?\" Her voice was sharp.    \"A rocket cruiser.\"    \"Will it take us off? To the Moon Base?\"    \"It's supposed to. In case of emergency.\" He rubbed his forehead.    \"What's wrong?\"    \"My head. It's hard to think. I can hardly--hardly concentrate. The  bomb.\"    \"Is the ship near here?\" Tasso slid over beside him, settling down on  her haunches. \"How far is it? Where is it?\"    \"I'm trying to think.\"    Her fingers dug into his arm. \"Nearby?\" Her voice was like iron.  \"Where would it be? Would they store it underground? Hidden  underground?\"    \"Yes. In a storage locker.\"    \"How do we find it? Is it marked? Is there a code marker to identify  it?\"    Hendricks concentrated. \"No. No markings. No code symbol.\"    \"What, then?\"    \"A sign.\"    \"What sort of sign?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks did not answer. In the flickering light his eyes were  glazed, two sightless orbs. Tasso's fingers dug into his arm.    \"What sort of sign? What is it?\"    \"I--I can't think. Let me rest.\"    \"All right.\" She let go and stood up. Hendricks lay back against the  ground, his eyes closed. Tasso walked away from him, her hands in her  pockets. She kicked a rock out of her way and stood staring up at the  sky. The night blackness was already beginning to fade into gray.  Morning was coming.    Tasso gripped her pistol and walked around the fire in a circle, back  and forth. On the ground Major Hendricks lay, his eyes closed,  unmoving. The grayness rose in the sky, higher and higher. The  landscape became visible, fields of ash stretching out in all  directions. Ash and ruins of buildings, a wall here and there, heaps  of concrete, the naked trunk of a tree.    The air was cold and sharp. Somewhere a long way off a bird made a few  bleak sounds.    Hendricks stirred. He opened his eyes. \"Is it dawn? Already?\"    \"Yes.\"    Hendricks sat up a little. \"You wanted to know something. You were  asking me.\"    \"Do you remember now?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What is it?\" She tensed. \"What?\" she repeated sharply.    \"A well. A ruined well. It's in a storage locker under a well.\"    \"A well.\" Tasso relaxed. \"Then we'll find a well.\" She looked at her  watch. \"We have about an hour, Major. Do you think we can find it in  an hour?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Give me a hand up,\" Hendricks said.    Tasso put her pistol away and helped him to his feet. \"This is going  to be difficult.\"    \"Yes it is.\" Hendricks set his lips tightly. \"I don't think we're  going to go very far.\"    They began to walk. The early sun cast a little warmth down on them.  The land was flat and barren, stretching out gray and lifeless as far  as they could see. A few birds sailed silently, far above them,  circling slowly.    \"See anything?\" Hendricks said. \"Any claws?\"    \"No. Not yet.\"    They passed through some ruins, upright concrete and bricks. A cement  foundation. Rats scuttled away. Tasso jumped back warily.    \"This used to be a town,\" Hendricks said. \"A village. Provincial  village. This was all grape country, once. Where we are now.\"    They came onto a ruined street, weeds and cracks criss-crossing it.  Over to the right a stone chimney stuck up.    \"Be careful,\" he warned her.    A pit yawned, an open basement. Ragged ends of pipes jutted up,  twisted and bent. They passed part of a house, a bathtub turned on its  side. A broken chair. A few spoons and bits of china dishes. In the  center of the street the ground had sunk away. The depression was  filled with weeds and debris and bones.    \"Over here,\" Hendricks murmured.    \"This way?\"    \"To the right.\"    They passed the remains of a heavy duty tank. Hendricks' belt counter  clicked ominously. The tank had been radiation blasted. A few feet  from the tank a mummified body lay sprawled out, mouth open. Beyond  the road was a flat field. Stones and weeds, and bits of broken glass.    \"There,\" Hendricks said.           *       *       *       *       *    A stone well jutted up, sagging and broken. A few boards lay across  it. Most of the well had sunk into rubble. Hendricks walked unsteadily  toward it, Tasso beside him.    \"Are you certain about this?\" Tasso said. \"This doesn't look like  anything.\"    \"I'm sure.\" Hendricks sat down at the edge of the well, his teeth  locked. His breath came quickly. He wiped perspiration from his face.  \"This was arranged so the senior command officer could get"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#8)"],[1,"hirt. I dined once more  with Rogendorf. I gave 2 stivers for the colour which is  found in the bricks; and I paid 9 stivers for an ox horn. I  made a charcoal portrait of a Spaniard. I have dined once  with my wife. I gave 2 stivers for a dozen little pipes; I  gave 3 stivers for two little maplewood bowls, two such  Felix gave my wife, and Master Jacob, the painter from  Lubeck, has given my wife another; dined once with  Rogendorf.  I paid 1 stiver for the printed \"Entry into  Antwerp,\" showing how the King was received with a splendid  triumph; the gates were beautifully decorated, and there  were plays, much rejoicing, and beautiful maidens in  tableaux vivants, whose like I have seldom seen. Changed 1  florin for expenses.    I have seen the bones of the great giant at Antwerp; his leg  above his knee is five and a half feet long, and beyond  measure heavy; so were his shoulder blades--a single one is  broader than a strong man's back--and his other limbs. The  man was eighteen feet high, and reigned at Antwerp and did  great wonders, as is set out in an old book which belongs to  the town magistrates.    Raphael of Urbino's effects have been all dispersed after  his death, but one of his disciples, Tommaso of Bologna by  name, a good painter, desired to see me, so he came to me  and gave me a gold ring, an antique with a well-cut stone  worth 5 florins, but I have been already offered twice as  much for it; in return I gave him my best engravings, worth  6 florins. I bought a piece of calico for 3 stivers, I gave  the messenger 1 stiver, and spent 3 stivers in company.    I presented to Lady Margaret, the Emperor's sister [Editor's  note: Actually, she was his aunt], a whole set of all my  works, and have drawn her two pictures on parchment with the  greatest pains and care; all this I have put at 30 florins,  and I have had to draw the design of the house for her  physician, the doctor, according to which he intends to  build one, and for drawing that I would not willingly take  less than 10 florins. I have given the servant 1 stiver, and  I paid 1 stiver for brick colour; I have given Herr Nicolas  Ziegler a \"Christ lying dead,\" worth 3 florins. To the  Portuguese factor I gave a painting of a \"Child's Head,\"  worth 1 florin. I have given 10 stivers for a buffalo horn;  I gave 1 gold florin for an elk's hoof.

I dined once with my wife; gave 3 stivers  for the little tract. The Bolognese has painted my portrait,  which he will take with him back to Rome.

In John Gabriel's house I have taken  the portrait of an Italian lord, who gave me 2 gold florins.  Bought a portmanteau for 2 florins, 4 stivers.      VISIT TO AACHEN    On Thursday after St. Michael's Day, I journeyed from  Antwerp to Aachen, and I took 1 gulden and I noble with me;  and after passing through Maestricht we came to Gulpen, and  from there to Aix on Sunday; there I have spent up till now,  with the fare and all, 3 florins. At Aachen I saw the well-  proportioned pillars with their good capitals of green and  red porphyry and granite which Carolus [Charlemagne] had  brought from Rome and set up there. These are made truly  according to Vitruvius's writings. At Aachen I bought an ox  horn for 1 gold florin. I have taken the portraits of Herr  Hans Ebner and George Schlaudersbach, and Hans Ebner's a  second time.

On the 23rd day of October King Charles was crowned at  Aachen; there I saw all manner of lordly splendour, the like  of which those who live in our parts have never seen--all,  as it has been described.    I gave Mathes works of art worth 2 florins, and presented  Stephen, Lady Margaret's chamberlain, with 3 prints.

Thence we traveled and  came on Sunday, which was St. Simon and St. Jude's Day, to  Cologne. I had lodging, food, and drink at Brussels with my  lords of Nuremberg, and they would take nothing from me for  it, and at Aachen likewise I ate with them three weeks and  they brought me to Cologne, and would take nothing for it.    I have bought a tract of Luther's for 5 white pf. besides 1  white pf. for the \"Condemnation of Luther,\" the pious man,  besides 1 white pf. for a Paternoster, and 2 white pf. for a  girdle, I white pf. for one pound of candles; changed 1  florin for expenses.
