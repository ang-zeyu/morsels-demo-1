The ends of the tube are sealed and  the bottom of the plug is drawn off, thus giving the finished \"blank\" as  shown by _h_. This blank is now held in a pair of asbestos-covered  tongs, heated to dull redness all over, and transferred to the annealing  oven.    When cold, the socket is ground out by the second method given under  \"Grinding Stoppers\"; that is to say, by means of type-metal or copper  cone, and the plug is ground to fit in a corresponding mould. When the  fit is almost perfect, the transverse hole is drilled in the plug, and  the final finishing is made with fine abrasive powder. Great care must  be taken in the final grinding that there is no accumulation of  abrasive material in the transverse hole of the plug; if this is allowed  to occur there will be a ring ground out of the socket where the holes  move, and the tightness of the finished stopcock will be lost.    _Marking Glass._--As a preliminary to a consideration of the methods of  graduating and calibrating glass apparatus, it is convenient to consider  the various methods which are available for marking glass. Among these  are, the writing diamond, the carborundum or abrasive pencil, the  cutting-wheel, and etching by means of hydrofluoric acid. Each produces  a different class of marking and each is worthy of independent  consideration.    _The Writing Diamond._--This is the name given to a small irregular  fragment of \"bort\" which is usually mounted in a thin brass rod. Such a  diamond, if properly selected, has none of the characteristics of a  cutting diamond; although one occasionally finds so-called \"writing  diamonds\" which will produce a definite cut. These should be rejected.    The writing diamond is used in much the same way as a pencil, but is  held more perpendicularly to the object, and a certain amount of  pressure is necessary. The mark produced is a thin scratch which,  although fairly definite, lacks breadth, and this is a disadvantage  where the marking has to be read at a distance. This disadvantage may to  some extent be overcome by making a number of parallel scratches.    _The Abrasive Pencil._--A rod of carborundum composition may be ground  or filed to a point, and this forms a very useful pencil for general  work. The marking produced is rather less definite than that produced by  a writing diamond, but has the advantage of being broader.    _The Cutting Wheel._--\"Cutting\" in this case is scarcely the ideal  expression, it should rather be \"grinding,\" but \"cutting\" is more  commonly used. Exceedingly good graduations may be made by the edge of a  small, thin, abrasive wheel which is mounted on the end of a small  mandrel and driven by a flexible shaft from an electric motor or any  other convenient source of power. The depth of the mark can be  controlled, and very light pressure will suffice.    _Etching._--This is often the quickest and easiest way of marking glass  apparatus. The object to be marked should first be warmed and coated  very thoroughly with a thin film of paraffin wax. When cold, the marking  is made through the paraffin wax by means of a needle point, and the  object is then exposed to the action of hydrofluoric acid. If a shallow  but clearly visible marking is desired, it is well to use the vapour of  the acid; this may be done by bending up a sheet-lead trough on which  the object can rest with the marked surface downwards. A little of the  commercial hydrofluoric acid, or a mixture of a fluoride and sulphuric  acid, is distributed over the bottom of the trough, and the whole  arrangement is allowed to stand for about an hour. The object is washed  thoroughly and the paraffin wax removed, either by melting and wiping  off or by the use of a solvent, and the marking is finished.    If a deep marking is desired, in order that it may afterwards be filled  with some pigment, a better result is obtained by the use of liquid  commercial hydrofluoric acid, which is a solution of hydrogen fluoride  in water. The acid is mopped on to the object after the markings have  been made on the paraffin wax film, and allowed to remain in contact for  a few minutes. It is advantageous to repeat the mopping-on process at  intervals during the etching.    In all cases where hydrofluoric acid is used, or stored, it is of great  importance to keep it well away from any optical instruments, as the  most minute trace of vapour in the air will produce a highly destructive  corrosion of any glass surfaces.    _Methods of Calibration._--In the case of apparatus for volumetric work,  this is usually carried out by weighing, although some of the smaller  subdivisions are often made by measurement. When the subdivisions are  made in this way it is of importance to see that the walls of the tube  or vessel to be calibrated are parallel. Great errors arise in some of  the commercial apparatus from neglect of this precaution. A convenient  method of testing for parallelism, in the case of a wide tube, is to  close one end and to weigh in successive quantities of mercury. An  observation of the length occupied by each successive quantity will  indicate any change in the bore. In the case of capillary tubes, it is  convenient to introduce an unweighed quantity of mercury, measure its  length accurately, and then to move it along the tube in stages, either  by tilting the tube or by the application of air pressure. A measurement  of the length at each stage will indicate whether the bore is  approximately parallel or not. Neither of these methods is to be relied  on without a careful examination of the tube, as it may happen that  there are local irregularities in the bore which compensate for each  other, and do not, therefore, affect the volume of a given length.  Obviously, the smaller the quantity of mercury with which the test is  carried out and the greater the number of observations made, the less  risk will there be of such an error. A liquid, such as water or alcohol,  which wets the glass is not suitable for such a test, unless special  precautions are taken.    When, however, a pipette or burette has to be calibrated to deliver a  certain volume of water, the final calibration must be made with this  liquid. Thus, the burette would first be calibrated by weighing in  definite quantities of mercury of say 13.54 grammes (1 cc at 15 deg.C.),  each of the 1 cc divisions should be marked by some temporary marking.  The burette is now filled with a solution of potassium bichromate and  sulphuric acid and allowed to soak for some time; the bichromate is  washed out and distilled water is put in. Successive quantities of water  are run out of the jet, a fixed time being allowed for draining, and the  weights of the quantities delivered are noted. This procedure will give  the necessary data for altering the marking so that it may correspond to  1 cc _delivered_. Each 1 cc division is now divided into tenths by the  method described below. A final verification of the markings should be  made when the subdivision is completed.    _Subdivision of Graduations._--Mark out the spaces to be subdivided on a  sheet of paper. Take a reliable ruler on which any convenient length is  divided into the desired number and place it across the lines at such an  angle that the limits noted on the rule exactly bridge the gap. Now draw  parallel lines through the markings.    _Copying a Scale._--When a scale has been prepared on paper and it is  necessary to copy that scale on the waxed-glass surface for etching, a  convenient method is to employ a long wooden bar having a sharp needle  passing through it at either end. The scale and object to be marked are  fastened in line with one another, and the caliper bar is used from step  to step. The mark is made by moving the bar through a minute portion of  a circle, which provided that the bar is two or three feet in length,  will not introduce any perceptible error in a scale of say a quarter of  an inch in width. The arrangement is shown by Fig. 15.    [Illustration: Fig. 15]    _Graduating a Thermometer._--Assuming that the thermometer has been made  of carefully selected tubing in which the bore is parallel and free from  any small irregularities, we have only to fix the freezing point and  boiling point. The intervening space may then be divided into 100 (if  the thermometer is to be Centigrade) or 180 (if Fahrenheit). This  division may be carried out by the method given under \"Subdivisions of  Graduations.\" A thermometer should not be calibrated until some weeks  after making, as the glass bulb tends to contract.    _Joining Glass and Metal._--It sometimes happens that one needs to make  a more permanent and less flexible joint between a glass and metal tube  than can be obtained by means of a rubber tube. To this end, any one of  three slightly different methods may be employed. In the method of  Chatelier one first coats the glass with platinum or silver, which may  be done by moistening the glass with platinum chloride or silver nitrate  and then heating to redness; a layer of copper is then deposited  electrolytically on the treated surface of the glass, and soldering is  carried out in the usual manner.    McKelvy and Taylor call attention to two other methods in the _Journal  of the Chemical Society_ for September, 1920. In one of these methods  the glass is coated with platinum by covering it with a suspension of  platinum chloride in oil of lavender and heating until the oil is burnt  off. The metal tube is then tinned on its inner side and soldered to the  prepared glass, slightly acid zinc chloride being used as a flux.    In the second method, a joint is made by means of the Kraus flux, which  consists of equal weights of zinc oxide, borax, and powdered soda-glass  fused together. This is coated on the inner surface of the metal tube,  and the hot glass tube, which has had the end slightly flanged to give  support, is inserted. Fusion of the flux is completed by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32974"],[0,"The Elements of Blowpipe Analysis (#8)"],[1,"        |  | Iron      | Red         | Reddish      |  |           |             |              |  | Lead      | Colorless   | Gray--Opaque |  |           |             |              |  | Magnesium | Colorless   | Colorless    |  |           |             |              |  | Manganese | Colorless   | Colorless    |  |           |             |              |  | Nickel    | Colorless   | Gray         |  |           |             |              |  | Silver    | Colorless   | Gray         |  |           |             |              |  | Strontium | Colorless   | Colorless    |  |           |             |              |  | Tin       | Colorless   | Colorless    |  |           |             |              |  | Zinc      | Colorless   | Gray--Cloudy |  ------------+-------------+--------------+      THE PRACTICAL METHODS    OF    ORGANIC CHEMISTRY    AUTHORIZED TRANSLATION    12mo.
