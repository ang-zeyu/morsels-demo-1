JOHN C. WRIGHT, we mourn the loss to the       State of Ohio, and to the nation at large, of one of our       most sagacious statesmen and distinguished patriots; and to       the cause of Union and conciliation, one of its most       illustrious supporters.         _Resolved_, That while we deplore with saddened hearts the       affliction with which an All-wise Providence has visited us,       we know that no transition from life to immortality could       have been more grateful to him who has fallen than this, in       which his life has been offered a willing sacrifice in an       effort to restore harmony to his distracted country.         _Resolved_, That the members of this Convention tender their       heartfelt sympathies to the family of the deceased in this       their great affliction.         _Resolved_, That these resolutions be spread upon the       records of this body, and a copy of the same be transmitted       to the family of the deceased.    Mr. CHARLES A. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky, moved the adoption of the  resolutions, and said:    Mr. PRESIDENT, I rise to tender my most cordial sanction and second to  the resolutions which have just been read.    Mr. WRIGHT and myself entered the councils of this nation thirty-seven  years ago. We served together during a period when party excitement  ran high upon questions more of a personal than a constitutional  character. I can bear witness not only to his ability, but to his  personal integrity, and his purity of political action through our  term of service in the House of Representatives. I have seldom met him  since we separated at the termination of his service and mine in that  body, which occurred at pretty near the same period; but whenever I  have met him, I have found him the same stern advocate of the Union  and of constitutional liberty. I rejoiced, therefore, when I found him  in this hall on the day we first assembled here. I knew his  conservative disposition and principles, and I promised myself that  with his aid I could be more useful to my country and to my State than  without him. In conversing with him upon the difficulties which now  divide and distract our common country, I found him ready and willing,  conscientiously and patriotically, to do that which I thought that  portion of the country which I represent has a right to demand and  expect of those who represent a different portion of our Union. And if  my friend from Ohio (Mr. CHASE) and his colleagues will permit me to  mingle my sorrow at the public loss, I will say nothing of the private  bereavement of the family of our deceased colleague. I leave him to  his country, and to you, with this testimony which I leave to his  memory, his honesty of purpose and his patriotic love of country.    The Hon. A.W. LOOMIS, of Pennsylvania, said:    Mr. PRESIDENT, I desire to mingle my sincere regrets with those of the  members of this assemblage at the sad and unexpected occurrence which  deprived us of an able, experienced, and patriotic associate. My  relations with the deceased were, for many years, probably more  intimate than those which existed between him and any other member of  this Convention. Forty years have elapsed since I first made his  acquaintance. He was then in full, active, and extensive practice; a  learned lawyer, an accomplished, skilful, and successful advocate.  During the succeeding year I came to the bar, and resided and  practiced in the same judicial circuit with our departed friend. For  many years the most kind and intimate relations existed between  us--sometimes colleagues, but usually opponents. So kind and genial  was his nature, so fair and liberal his practice, that during our  entire intercourse not an unkind word was uttered, and, so far as I  know or believe, not an unpleasant feeling existed in the bosom of  either.    Though not gifted with the highest order of eloquence, he was clear,  distinct, and persuasive. His style of speaking resembled not the  babbling brook or the dashing cataract, but usually the limpid stream,  gliding gracefully amid fields and fruits and flowers, though  sometimes assuming the power and proportions of the majestic river,  cutting its sure and certain way to the mighty ocean.    His professional position, his kindness of heart, and genial humor,  made him an object of high respect and warm regard among his  professional brethren. And now, sir, as memory passes in review the  pleasant incidents which marked our social and professional  intercourse, the smitten heart shrinks in sadness and sorrow from the  contemplation of our bereavement. He adorned, sir, the bar, the bench,  and the halls of Legislation. He discharged, in all the relations of  life, his obligations with fidelity. Of him it might be truly said:         His life hath flowed a sacred stream, in whose calm depths       The beautiful and pure alone are mirrored;       Which, though shapes of ill may hover o'er the surface,       Glides in light, and takes no shadows from them.    But, sir, the great crowning virtue and glory of his life was his  acceptance of the mission which brought him here. Though whitened by  the frosts of nearly eighty winters, neither lofty mountains nor  intervening space could restrain his patriotic heart from a prompt  response to the call of his country to mingle his influence in a  sincere and sacred effort to save the Constitution and perpetuate the  Union. He accepted the great trust; he mingled in our deliberations,  and has fallen in the discharge of his duty. He has justly earned a  title to the gratitude and respect of his country. May we not, sir,  fondly hope that he, who was called from the discharge of such duties  to the presence of his God, has passed from the sorrows of earth to  the happiness of Heaven, and to the full fruition of joys pure,  perfect, and eternal?    The Hon. THOMAS EWING, of Ohio, said:--I rise to bear my tribute of  respect to the memory of the deceased. I have known him long. On my  first entrance into active life, at the bar, I found him an able and  distinguished member. Since that time down to the present day, he has  been largely associated, in mind and person, with all the acts and  progress, professional and political, of my life. I feel his loss  intensely; and I feel it with more regret, because I know that on this  occasion his voice would have been potential in our counsels, and  would have been united with all of us who labor most earnestly for the  preservation of the Union.    I tender my sympathies to the family of the deceased. I unite with  them in their regrets and in their hopes of the happy future to which  he may have attained.    The Hon. WILLIAM C. RIVES, of Virginia, said:--Though wholly  unprepared to say any thing worthy of the solemnity of this occasion,  I feel that I should be wanting, sir, in that sentiment of respect  which is due to the character of a distinguished citizen, if I were  not to add to what has been so eloquently spoken by others, a few  words of personal recollection in regard to our deceased friend Judge  WRIGHT. It so happened that we entered the public councils of the  country at the same moment, and continued in them for the same period  of time. It is now just thirty-seven years since I had the pleasure of  meeting Judge WRIGHT, for the first time, in the House of  Representatives of the United States. I may be permitted to say, that  there were giants in those days. My honorable friend from Kentucky  (Governor WICKLIFFE), who has already so feelingly addressed the  Convention, will recollect that on the roll of the House of  Representatives at that time stood the names of WEBSTER and EVERETT,  of OAKLEY and STORRS, of SARGEANT and of HEMPHILL, of LEWIS McLANE, of  the immortal CLAY, and BARBOUR and RANDALL, and other gentlemen known  to fame from the State which I have the honor to represent in this  body, and LIVINGSTON of Louisiana, McDUFFIE and HAMILTON of South  Carolina, and other gentlemen who, on the spur of the occasion, I am  not now able to recall, but whose names will forever shine upon the  rolls of their country's glory. And yet in that body Judge WRIGHT,  then in the maturity of his powers, though not previously known to the  nation, vindicated an equal rank in debate with those gentlemen whose  names I have mentioned. Sir, I shall never forget with what  earnestness, with what manliness, with what integrity, with what  ability, he ever uttered his convictions of public duty, whatever they  were, in that consecrated hall.    After remaining here, I think, for six years, he retired to his own  State for the purpose of assuming the duties of a highly-important and  dignified office, which was soon followed by his retirement into the  bosom of private life, where he met a rich and ample solace for the  storms of his public career. He was followed there by the respect of  his fellow-citizens throughout the country, and the confidence of his  own State, as we have recently seen, by his being called from that  honorable retirement to take part in the grave and solemn duties of  this assembly. Sir, he came among us in obedience to the solemn call  of patriotic duty, at a most exigent and distressing period in our  national annals. He came here on an errand of peace, in the spirit of  peace and conciliation. Such was the feeling entertained toward him by  the whole of this assembly, that without the slightest preconcert, so  far as I know, he was invited by general consent to preside during the  preliminary stages of the organization of this Convention. I had an  opportunity, from time to time, of private conversation with the aged  statesman. I found no member of the assembly I met here, and, indeed,  I have found nowhere any citizen of this wide Republic of ours, whose  heart was more deeply imbued with the spirit of conciliation and of  peace--of that spirit which was"]]]
