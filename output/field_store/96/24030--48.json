Next, sand the shellac coat lightly when it has hardened. Apply a coat  of paste filler colored considerably darker than the stain to the tone  desired for the open grain. If the filler is well stirred and properly  applied, one coat ought to be sufficient. If it does not fill the pores  satisfactorily, apply another coat when the first has had time to  harden. Vandyke brown is used to color the filler, if none but natural  color is to be had. On the hardened filler apply a thin coat of shellac.  On this apply several coats of wax. The directions for waxing will be  found upon the cans in which the wax comes.          A BOOKCASE      This beautiful piece of mission furniture can be made at a very moderate  cost by anyone who has a slight knowledge of tools. Considerable labor  can be saved by ordering the material from the mill ready cut to size,  dressed and sanded. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to use and it is  comparatively easy to obtain. Plain-sawed oak looks well, but is more  liable to warp than the quarter-sawed and this is quite an element in  pieces as wide as the ones used. For the complete bookcase the following  material will be needed:      1 top, 3/4 by 15 by 31-1/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.    1 top back board, 3/4 by 4 by 30-1/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.    2 sides, 3/4 by 14 by 50 in., hard wood, S-1-S.    1 bottom, 3/4 by 14 by 28-3/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.    1 bottom rail, 3/4 by 4 by 28-3/4 in., hard wood, S-1-S.    1 center piece, 3/4 by 2 by 45-3/4 in., hard wood, S-2-S.    4 door sides, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 45-1/4 in., hard wood, S-2-S.    4 door ends, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 14 in., hard wood, S-2-S.    4 pieces door lattice, 1/2 by 1/2 by 12-1/2 in., hard wood.    4 pieces door lattice, 1/2 by 1/2 by 7 in., hard wood.    2 bottom cleats, 1-1/4 by 1-1/4 by 13 in., soft wood.    2 top cleats, 1 by 1 by 12-1/2 in., soft wood.    3 shelves, 1/2 by 12 by 28-1/2 in., soft wood.   12 pieces backing, 3/8 by 4 by 29-3/4 in., soft wood.    4 hinges.    2 door handles.    Begin with the sides by cutting them so they will pair up all right. The  front edges are rounded while the back edges are rabbeted on the inside  as deep as the backing to be used. The bottoms are cut as shown in the  sketch. Holes about 1/2 in. deep should be bored on the inside at the  proper places for the wooden pegs which hold up the shelves.    [Illustration: Completed Bookcase.]    [Illustration: Details of Bookcase]    The top and bottom boards should have the front edges rounded and sanded  the same as the sides. The top board is sanded on one side only and  care should be taken to get the best side up.    Now cut and fit the top back board. This is fastened to the top by means  of screws. Screw two cleats to each of the sides as shown and by running  screws through these into the top and bottom boards the frame is  completed.    The backing which can be made of some cheap lumber is now put on. Next  put in the center upright piece between the doors by means of a tenon  and mortise at the top and nail at the bottom. The front edge should be  rounded and the edge and sides sanded. Cut and fit the bottom rail as  shown. It is fastened to the frame by means of cleats on the back side.    The doors are put together by means of a tenon and mortise. They should  be rabbeted for the lattice work and the glass. This lattice work can be  omitted and leaded glass put in its place which is very becoming to this  kind of work.    When the case is completed it must be carefully gone over with sandpaper  before any finish is applied.    A mission stain is suitable for work of this kind, but it can also be  finished in \"golden oak\" which is done in the following manner: First  put on a golden oak stain and after it has dried for about 2 hours,  apply the filler. Let this dry about 10 minutes then rub off with an old  rag. Then go over the case again with some very fine sandpaper and after  seeing that all parts are free from dust and dirt the varnish can be  applied. Three coats of varnish will give a beautiful glossy finish.          A LAMP STAND      A mission table lamp stand for those who use electric lights is shown in  the accompanying illustration. It is suitable for either the office or  the home and is very simple in design and construction. The stock should  be quarter-sawed oak and it can be ordered from the mill ready cut to  length, squared and sanded. The following pieces will be needed:      1 post, 1-1/2 in. sq. by 23 in.    1 arm, 1-/8 by 3/4 by 13-1/2 in.    1 block, 3/4 in. thick by 6 in. square.    1 block, 1 in. thick by 9 in. square.    [Illustration: Details of Lamp Stand]    Square up the base blocks and fasten them together with screws as shown  in the detail sketch. A mortise, 1 in. square, is cut in the center of  the blocks for the center post.. Lead weights, covered with felt,  should be attached to the bottom, as shown. The post has a tenon cut on  one end to fit the base, and a mortise cut in the other for the arm.  Holes are bored in the arm from the ends for the wires. They can be  plugged after the wires are in place. A hole is also bored in the top of  the center post to connect with the holes in the arm for the lead wire.    [Illustration: Electric Lamp Stand Complete]    It is best to glue the joints together, although this is not necessary  if the joints are a tight fit. Sandpaper the parts thoroughly, then  stain to match the other furniture.    [Illustration: Extension Dining Table Complete]          AN EXTENSION DINING TABLE      The accompanying sketch and photograph show a simple design of an  extension dining table of the mission style. It is very easy to  construct and can be built at home by anyone who is at all handy with  tools. It should be made of quarter-sawed oak, which can be secured at  the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. Order the following  pieces:      2 top pieces, 1 by 23 by 46 in.    2 extra leaves, 1 by 12 by 46 in.    2 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 44 in.    4 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 22 in.    2 pieces for posts, 3/4 by 8 by 24 in.    2 pieces for posts, 3/4 by 6 by 24 in.    4 pieces for feet, 3 by 3 by 14 in.    4 pieces for feet, 3 by 3 by 5 in.    4 pieces for feet, 1 by 4 by 4 in.    4 pieces moulding, 1 by 1 by 10 in.    1 piece, 1 by 12 by 27 in., birchwood.    2 brackets, 3/4 by 3 by 32 in., birchwood.    2 pieces for slide, 1-3/4 by 3 by 36 in., birchwood.    4 pieces for slide, 1 by 3 by 36 in., birchwood.   12 pieces for slide, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 36 in., birchwood.    The feet can be made first by squaring up one end of each and beveling  the other as shown in the drawing. The short pieces are fastened to the  long ones by means of long screws and glue. The four square pieces  should be nailed to the outer ends and holes bored in them for the  casters. Prepare the pieces for the posts, and before nailing them  together fasten the feet to them with long screws. Be careful to get  them on square, else the table will not set level when complete. Now  nail and glue the pieces forming the table together and fasten the  moulding at the bottom. This moulding should have mitered corners as  shown in the bottom view. Also fasten the rest piece to the top of the  post, using long screws and glue.    [Illustration: Details of Dining Table]    The slides can be made next. The pieces are made and fastened together  with screws as shown in the enlarged detail view. This slide, if made  with care, is a good one. The center piece should be firmly fastened to  the post rest with long screws. The screws that fasten into the top  should be inserted from below through counter-bored holes as shown.    Miter the rails at the corners and glue them to the top. Blocks can be  used on the inside if desired, which will make a much stronger  construction. Screw the two brackets to the top as shown. These help to  support the table when it is extended.    When complete the table should be carefully gone over with fine  sandpaper, and all glue and rough spots removed. Apply stain of the  desired color. This can be any one of the many mission stains supplied  by the trade for this purpose.          AN OAK-BOUND CEDAR CHEST      This cedar chest for storing unused bedding or furs is not a difficult  thing to make and when made, the hard oak binding takes the wear and  protects the softer cedar so that the chest ought to serve several  generations. Order the stock as follows:    CEDAR      2 top and bottom pieces, 7/8 by 16-1/2 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 sides, 7/8 by 18-7/8 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 ends, 7/8 by 18-7/8 by 14-3/4 in., S-2-S.    OAK      2 overhanging top pieces, 1 by 1 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 overhanging top pieces, 1 by 1 by 18-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 lock and hinge rails, 1 by 2-1/2 by 36-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 lock and hinge rails, 1 by 2-1/2 by 18-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 base pieces, 1 by 3-1/4 by 36-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 base pieces, 1 by 3-1/4 by 18-1/2 in., S-2-S.    [Illustration: Details of Cedar Chest]    Specify thoroughly seasoned Tennessee red cedar and plain sawed white  oak and have the different pieces mill-planed and sandpapered as  indicated in the stock-bill. This bill allows 1/2 in. extra on the  length and the width of each piece for \"squaring up\" of all pieces  except those marked to be surfaced on four sides.    Begin by squaring the sides and ends to size. Probably the best joint  for the corners is the dovetail. If the worker is not experienced in  woodworking, some of the more simple joints will do. It will be noted  that the drawing and stock-bill call for the simplest form of joint,  that in which the sides of the chest lap over the end. For the dovetail  joint it will be necessary to add 2 in. more to the length of the end  pieces, making them 16-3/4 in. each in the rough.    Having got the sides and ends ready, fasten them together.

XXXII    Habit alleviates the grief  Inseparable from our lot;  This great discovery relief  And consolation soon begot.  And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure  Found out the secret how at pleasure  To dominate her worthy lord,  And harmony was soon restored.  The workpeople she superintended,  Mushrooms for winter salted down,  Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,(*)  The bath on Saturdays attended,  When angry beat her maids, I grieve,  And all without her husband's leave.    [Note: The serfs destined for military service used to have  a portion of their heads shaved as a distinctive mark.]    XXXIII    In her friends' albums, time had been,  With blood instead of ink she scrawled,  Baptized Prascovia Pauline,  And in her conversation drawled.  She wore her corset tightly bound,  The Russian N with nasal sound  She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;  But soon she altered all her ways,  Corset and album and Pauline,  Her sentimental verses all,  She soon forgot, began to call  Akulka who was once Celine,  And had with waddling in the end  Her caps and night-dresses to mend.    XXXIV    As for her spouse he loved her dearly,  In her affairs ne'er interfered,  Entrusted all to her sincerely,  In dressing-gown at meals appeared.  Existence calmly sped along,  And oft at eventide a throng  Of friends unceremonious would  Assemble from the neighbourhood:  They growl a bit--they scandalise--  They crack a feeble joke and smile--  Thus the time passes and meanwhile  Olga the tea must supervise--  'Tis time for supper, now for bed,  And soon the friendly troop hath fled.    XXXV    They in a peaceful life preserved  Customs by ages sanctified,  Strictly the Carnival observed,  Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,  Twice in the year to fast were bound,  Of whirligigs were very fond,  Of Christmas carols, song and dance;  When people with long countenance  On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,  Three tears they dropt with humble mein  Upon a bunch of lovage green;  _Kvass_ needful was to them as air;  On guests their servants used to wait  By rank as settled by the State.(27)    [Note 27: The foregoing stanza requires explanation. Russian  pancakes or \"blinni\" are consumed vigorously by the lower  orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult  to procure them, at any rate in the large towns.    The Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which  are also much in vogue during the Carnival.    \"Christmas Carols\" is not an exact equivalent for the Russian  phrase. \"Podbliudni pessni,\" are literally \"dish songs,\" or  songs used with dishes (of water) during the \"sviatki\" or Holy  Nights, which extend from Christmas to Twelfth Night, for  purposes of divination. Reference will again be made to this  superstitious practice, which is not confined to Russia. See Note 52.    \"Song and dance,\" the well-known \"khorovod,\" in which the dance  proceeds to vocal music.    \"Lovage,\" the _Levisticum officinalis_, is a hardy plant growing  very far north, though an inhabitant of our own kitchen gardens.  The passage containing the reference to the three tears and  Trinity Sunday was at first deemed irreligious by the Russian  censors, and consequently expunged.    _Kvass_ is of various sorts: there is the common _kvass_ of  fermented rye used by the peasantry, and the more expensive  _kvass_ of the restaurants, iced and flavoured with various fruits.    The final two lines refer to the \"Tchin,\" or Russian social  hierarchy. There are fourteen grades in the Tchin assigning  relative rank and precedence to the members of the various  departments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,  scientific and educational. The military and naval grades from  the 14th up to the 7th confer personal nobility only, whilst  above the 7th hereditary rank is acquired. In the remaining  departments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only  attained with the 9th grade, hereditary with the 4th.]    XXXVI    Thus age approached, the common doom,  And death before the husband wide  Opened the portals of the tomb  And a new diadem supplied.(28)  Just before dinner-time he slept,  By neighbouring families bewept,  By children and by faithful wife  With deeper woe than others' grief.  He was an honest gentleman,  And where at last his bones repose  The epitaph on marble shows:  _Demetrius Larine, sinful man,  Servant of God and brigadier,  Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.    [Note 28: A play upon the word \"venetz,\" crown, which also  signifies a nimbus or glory, and is the symbol of marriage  from the fact of two gilt crowns being held over the heads  of the bride and bridegroom during the ceremony. The literal  meaning of the passage is therefore: his earthly marriage  was dissolved and a heavenly one was contracted.]    XXXVII    To his Penates now returned,  Vladimir Lenski visited  His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned  Above the ashes of the dead.  There long time sad at heart he stayed:  \"Poor Yorick,\" mournfully he said,  \"How often in thine arms I lay;  How with thy medal I would play,  The Medal Otchakoff conferred!(29)  To me he would his Olga give,  Would whisper: shall I so long live?\"--  And by a genuine sorrow stirred,  Lenski his pencil-case took out  And an elegiac poem wrote.    [Note 29: The fortress of Otchakoff was taken by storm on the  18th December 1788 by a Russian army under Prince Potemkin.  Thirty thousand Turks are said to have perished during the  assault and ensuing massacre.]    XXXVIII    Likewise an epitaph with tears  He writes upon his parents' tomb,  And thus ancestral dust reveres.  Oh! on the fields of life how bloom  Harvests of souls unceasingly  By Providence's dark decree!  They blossom, ripen and they fall  And others rise ephemeral!  Thus our light race grows up and lives,  A moment effervescing stirs,  Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,  The appointed hour arrives, arrives!  And our successors soon shall drive  Us from the world wherein we live.    XXXIX    Meantime, drink deeply of the flow  Of frivolous existence, friends;  Its insignificance I know  And care but little for its ends.  To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,  Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise  And agitate my heart again;  And thus it is 'twould cause me pain  Without the faintest trace to leave  This world. I do not praise desire,  Yet still apparently aspire  My mournful fate in verse to weave,  That like a friendly voice its tone  Rescue me from oblivion.    XL    Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,  And then the stanzas of my theme  Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,  Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.  Then it may be, O flattering tale,  Some future ignoramus shall  My famous portrait indicate  And cry: he was a poet great!  My gratitude do not disdain,  Admirer of the peaceful Muse,  Whose memory doth not refuse  My light productions to retain,  Whose hands indulgently caress  The bays of age and helplessness.

Many  eminent English poets have been laid under contribution by him,  often without going through the form of acknowledging the  source of inspiration. Even the poem in question cannot be  pronounced entirely original, though its intrinsic beauty is  unquestionable. It undoubtedly owes its origin to Burger's poem  \"Leonora,\" which has found so many English translators. Not  content with a single development of Burger's ghastly production  the Russian poet has directly paraphrased \"Leonora\" under its  own title, and also written a poem \"Liudmila\" in imitation of it.
