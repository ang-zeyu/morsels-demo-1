Bassariscus astutus flavus Rhoads Ringtail         _Specimens examined._--Total, 4: MV 7884/507 and 7885/507, trapped       in Balcony House and prepared by D. Watson in 1939; MV 7901/507 and       7902/507, without data.    The cliff dwellings are favored by ringtails and in some years they are  common near occupied dwellings in the area of headquarters. Ringtails  have been seen in each major habitat within the Park.      Mustela frenata nevadensis Hall Long-tailed Weasel         _Specimens examined._--Total, 5: MV 7891/507, [Male], from the       \"Garden\" [= Indian Cornfield]; [Female], MV 7892/507, also from       the \"Cornfield\"; MV 7859/507, \"Killed by car on Prater Grade\";       [Male], MV 7871/507, in winter pelage, from the North Rim; and       [Male], 83464, killed on the road 1/2 mi. NE of the tunnel,       Morfield Canyon.    C.W. Quaintance in 1935 reported that on January 11, he and Mr. Nelson  saw a weasel attack a cottontail, and on March 9, while on the snow  plow, Mr. Nelson witnessed another cottontail being killed by a weasel.  Weasels in white winter pelage have been recorded in December and  January. The brown pelage has been seen as late as November.      Mustela vison energumenos (Bangs) Mink    D. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) wrote: \"When Jack Wade, now  Chief Ranger, was doing patrol work in the Mancos Canyon back in the  1930's, he saw mink along the river at the east side of the Park.  Several years ago, the people who lived on the ranch where Weber Canyon  joins the Mancos trapped a mink.\" Tracks have been reported along the  Mancos River in several years.      Spilogale putorius gracilis Merriam Spotted Skunk         _Specimen_: Immature [Male], MV 7860/507, Cliff Palace, August       22, 1936, prepared by A.E. Borrell.    In some years these little skunks have become so numerous in the area of  headquarters that they were a nuisance, and were captured in garbage  cans and released in other parts of the Park.      Mephitis mephitis estor Merriam Striped Skunk    D. Watson advises me that striped skunks are fairly common around the  entrance to the Park, along the foot of the Mesa, and along the Mancos  River. Striped skunks have been reported in 1951 in Morfield Canyon, in  1952 on the Knife Edge, in 1953 at Windy Point (1/4 mi. N of Point  Lookout), and in 1959 at the head of Morfield Canyon.    [Illustration: PLATE 1    UPPER: View of the North Rim of Mesa Verde, looking west from Park  Point, the highest place on the North Rim. The south-facing slope on the  left is covered with brushy vegetation, mostly oak. Sheltered parts of  the north-facing slope support stands of Douglas fir, and at a few  places some ponderosa pines.

The area in the foreground on  Wetherill Mesa was burned in 1934. Photo taken in August, 1956, by S.  Anderson.    LOWER RIGHT: Prater Canyon, at Upper Well, 7575 feet. In the matted  grasses and sedges on the floor of the canyon _Microtus montanus_ and  _Sorex vagrans_ were captured. _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_ was found in a  side canyon, Chickaree Draw, one half mile southwest of the place shown.  Chickaree Draw is more sheltered than the slope in the background and  has a denser stand of Douglas fir than occurs here. Photo taken in  August, 1956, by S. Anderson.]    [Illustration: PLATE 2    UPPER: Relatively undisturbed stand of pinyon pine and Utah juniper 1/4  mi. N Rock Springs, at 7400 feet elevation on Wetherill Mesa along a  service road.

NNW Rock Springs, 7500 feet elevation.  This area burned in 1934. It contained no pine or juniper in 1956  despite attempted reforestation in the thirties and the presence of a  stand of pinyon and juniper (shown above) only one quarter of a mile  away. Possibly fire in the last three or four hundred years on the  higher parts of the Mesa has been a factor in producing chaparral there,  rather than pinyon and juniper. Photo taken in August, 1956, by S.  Anderson.]      Taxidea taxus berlandieri Baird Badger    Several reports, but no specimens, of the badger have been obtained. In  1935, C.W. Quaintance wrote that in School Section Canyon tracks of  cougar, bobcat, coyote, and deer were found, and that pocket gophers,  badgers, and cottontail rabbits were present. Later in 1935, H.P. Pratt  wrote that he had found evidence of badgers \"at the lower well in Prater  Canyon, where on September 23, there were extensive badger diggings and  fresh tracks in the vicinity of the prairie dog colony there.\" Badgers  are common in the lowlands around the Mesa and they are common enough on  the Mesa to be regarded as nuisances by archeologists on account of  badgers digging in ruins. Badgers have been seen from three to six times  each year from 1950 to this date, most of them in the vicinity of the  North Rim.      Felis concolor hippolestes Merriam Mountain Lion    Mountain lions range throughout the Park. There are reliable sight  records of lions and lion tracks, but no specimen has been preserved.  Early records of observations include the report of tracks seen in  Navajo Canyon by Cary (1911:165), and a lion seen in 1917. Since 1930  the more adequate records include reports of from one to eight  observations each year for 26 of the 30 years. Young animals (recorded  as \"half-grown\") or cubs have been reported in four of these years. The  tabulation of dated reports by month beginning with January is: 2, 0, 3,  2, 8, 4, 6, 7, 4, 9, 5, 7. Mountain lions range more widely than bears  in their daily and seasonal activities, but like bears probably breed,  bear young, and feed in the Park. Although at any one time lions may or  may not be within the Park, it is part of their normal range and the  species should be regarded as resident and is not uncommon.      Lynx rufus baileyi Merriam Bobcat         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: A specimen (now mounted in Park       Museum) from the Knife Edge Road; and ad. [Female], 76302,       Prater Canyon, 7500 ft., November 12, 1957, obtained by J.R.       Alcorn.    Bobcats are present throughout the Park. Approximately 80 observations  of bobcats are on file, from all parts of the Park and in all months.  Probably the bobcat and the gray fox are the most abundant carnivores in  the Park. In addition to known predation by mountain lions and coyotes  on porcupines, the bobcat kills porcupines. A dead porcupine and a dead  bobcat with its face, mouth, and one foot full of quills were found  together on January 31, 1952, under a boulder in front of Cliff Palace.  On August 20, 1956, I saw a bobcat hunting in sage in a draw near a  large clump of oak-brush, into which it fled, at the head of the east  fork of Navajo Canyon, Sect. 21, near the North Rim, 8100 feet.      Odocoileus hemionus hemionus (Rafinesque) Mule Deer         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Young [Male], 76303, November       8, 1957, Far View Ruins; [Female], 76304, November 12, 1957,       Spruce Tree House Ruin, both obtained by J.R. Alcorn.    In all parts of the Park, mule deer are common. Five projects concerning  deer are in progress or have been concluded recently on the Mesa. One is  a study of the responses of different species of plants to browsing and  was begun in 1949 by Harold R. Shepherd for the Colorado Department of  Game and Fish. A number of individual plants and in some instances  groups of plants were fenced to exclude deer. Systematic clips of 20,  40, 60, 80, or 100 per cent of the annual growth are made each year. The  results of the first ten years of this study are being prepared for  publication by Shepherd.    A study of browsing pressure was initiated in 1952 by Regional Biologist  C.M. Aldous, on eight transects in the Park. Each transect consists of  15 plots at intervals of 200 feet. The amount of use of each plant  species was recorded from time to time. The study was terminated in  1955. I have seen no summary of results of this study.    A trapping program was begun in 1953 with the co-operation of the  Colorado Department of Game and Fish. Deer are trapped, marked, and  released. Some are released in areas other than where trapped. In this  way the excessive size of the herd near headquarters has been reduced.  Recoveries of marked deer outside the Park by hunters and retrapping  results in the Park should provide information about movements of deer  and about life expectancy.    The \"Deer Trend Study\" was initiated in 1954. From November to May,  twice a day, at the same time, a count is made along the entrance road  from the Park Entrance to Headquarters. Ten drainage areas traversed are  tabulated separately. The results of four years of this study indicate  that the greatest number of deer are present in November, December, and  January, and that only about one-fourth as many are present in February  and March. Depending on severity of weather, the yearly pattern varies,  the deer arriving earlier, or leaving earlier. This change in numbers,  the recovery outside of the Park of animals marked in the Park, and  direct observations of movement indicate that the Mesa Verde is an  intermediate range rather than a summer-range or winter-range. In summer  deer tend to move northward and eastward out of the Park, and in winter  they move back through the Park toward lower and more protected areas in  canyons both in the Park and south of the Park on the Ute Reservation.  Some deer remain in the Park the entire year. Close co-operation between  personnel of the Park Service and of the Colorado Department of Game and  Fish has regulated hunting outside the Park in such a way as to provide  satisfactory control of the deer within"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#8)"],[1,"y, closed with it. _Twaddle_ for a while succeeded _bore_; but  _bore_ has recovered the supremacy. We want another Swift to give a new  edition of his \"Polite Conversation.\" A dictionary of barbarisms too  might be collected from some wretched neologists, whose pens are now at  work! Lord Chesterfield, in his exhortations to conform to Johnson's  Dictionary, was desirous, however, that the great lexicographer should  add as an appendix, \"_A neological dictionary_, containing those polite,  though perhaps not strictly grammatical, words and phrases commonly  used, and sometimes understood by the _beau-monde_.\"[26] This last  phrase was doubtless a contribution! Such a dictionary had already  appeared in the French language, drawn up by two caustic critics, who in  the _Dictionnaire neologique a l'usage des beaux Esprits du Siecle_  collected together the numerous unlucky inventions of affectation, with  their modern authorities! A collection of the fine words and phrases,  culled from some very modern poetry, might show the real amount of the  favours bestowed on us.    The attempts of neologists are, however, not necessarily to be  condemned; and we may join with the commentators of Aulus Gellius, who  have lamented the loss of a chapter of which the title only has  descended to us. That chapter would have demonstrated what happens to  all languages, that some neologisms, which at first are considered  forced or inelegant, become sanctioned by use, and in time are quoted as  authority in the very language which, in their early stage, they were  imagined to have debased.    The true history of men's minds is found in their actions; their wants  are indicated by their contrivances; and certain it is that in highly  cultivated ages we discover the most refined intellects attempting  NEOLOGISMS.[27] It would be a subject of great curiosity to trace the  origin of many happy expressions, when, and by whom created. Plato  substituted the term _Providence_ for _fate_; and a new system of human  affairs arose from a single word. Cicero invented several; to this  philosopher we owe the term of _moral_ philosophy, which before his time  was called the philosophy of _manners_. But on this subject we are  perhaps more interested by the modern than by the ancient languages.  Richardson, the painter of the human heart, has coined some expressions  to indicate its little secret movements, which are admirable: that great  genius merited a higher education and more literary leisure than the  life of a printer could afford. Montaigne created some bold expressions,  many of which have not survived him; his _incuriosite_, so opposite to  curiosity, well describes that state of negligence where we will not  learn that of which we are ignorant. With us the word _incurious_ was  described by Heylin, 1656, as an unusual word; it has been appropriately  adopted by our best writers, although we still want _incuriosity_.  Charron invented _etrangete_ unsuccessfully, but which, says a French  critic, would be the true substantive of the word _etrange_; our Locke  is the solitary instance produced for \"foreignness\" for \"remoteness or  want of relation to something.\" Malherbe borrowed from the Latin,  _insidieux_, _securite_, which have been received; but a bolder word,  _devouloir_, by which he proposed to express _cesser de vouloir_, has  not. A term, however, expressive and precise. Corneille happily  introduced _invaincu_ in a verse in the Cid,      Vous etes _invaincu_, mais non pas _invincible_.    Yet this created word by their great poet has not sanctioned this fine  distinction among the French, for we are told that it is almost a  solitary instance. Balzac was a great inventor of neologisms. _Urbanite_  and _feliciter_ were struck in his mint. \"Si le mot _feliciter_ n'est  pas francaise, il le sera l'annee qui vient;\" so confidently proud was  the neologist, and it prospered as well as _urbanite_, of which he says,  \"Quand l'usage aura muri parmi nous un mot de si mauvais gout, et  corrige _l'amertume de la nouveaute_ qui s'y peut trouver, nous nous y  accoutumerons comme aux autres que nous avons emprunte de la meme  langue.\" Balzac was, however, too sanguine in some other words; for his  _delecter_, his _seriosite_, &c. still retain their \"bitterness of  novelty.\"    Menage invented a term of which an equivalent is wanting in our  language; \"J'ai fait _prosateur_ a l'imitation de l'italien _prosatore_,  pour dire un homme qui ecrit en prose.\" To distinguish a prose from a  verse writer, we _once_ had \"a proser.\" Drayton uses it; but this useful  distinction has unluckily degenerated, and the current sense is so daily  urgent, that the purer sense is irrecoverable.    When D'Albancourt was translating Lucian, he invented in French the  words _indolence_ and _indolent_, to describe a momentary languor,  rather than that habitual indolence in which sense they are now  accepted; and in translating Tacitus, he created the word  _turbulemment_; but it did not prosper any more than that of  _temporisement_. Segrais invented the word _impardonnable_, which, after  having been rejected, was revived, and is equivalent to our expressive  _unpardonable_. Moliere ridiculed some neologisms of the _Precieuses_ of  his day; but we are too apt to ridicule that which is new, and which we  often adopt when it becomes old. Moliere laughed at the term  _s'encanailler_, to describe one who assumed the manners of a  blackguard; the expressive word has remained in the language. The  meaning is disputed as well as the origin is lost of some novel terms.  This has happened to a word in daily use--_Fudge_! It is a cant term not  in Grose, and only traced by Todd not higher than to Goldsmith. It is,  however, no invention of his. In a pamphlet, entitled \"Remarks upon the  Navy,\" 1700, the term is declared to have been the name of a certain  nautical personage who had lived in the lifetime of the writer. \"There  was, sir, in our time, one _Captain Fudge_, commander of a merchantman,  who upon his return from a voyage, how ill-fraught soever his ship was,  always brought home his owners a good cargo of lies; so much that now,  aboard ship, the sailors, when they hear a great lie told, cry out, 'You  _fudge_ it!'\" It is singular that such an obscure byword among sailors  should have become one of the most popular in our familiar style; and  not less, that recently at the bar, in a court of law, its precise  meaning perplexed plaintiff and defendant and their counsel. I think it  does not signify mere lies, but bouncing lies, or rhodomontades.    There are two remarkable French words created by the Abbe de Saint  Pierre, who passed his meritorious life in the contemplation of  political morality and universal benevolence--_bienfaisance_ and  _gloriole_. He invented _gloriole_ as a contemptuous diminutive of  _glorie_; to describe that vanity of some egotists, so proud of the  small talents which they may have received from nature or from accident.  _Bienfaisance_ first appeared in this sentence: \"L'Esprit de la vraie  religion et le principal but de l'evangile c'est _la bienfaisance_,  c'est-a-dire la pratique de la charite envers le prochain.\" This word  was so new, that in the moment of its creation this good man explained  its necessity and origin. Complaining that \"the word 'charity' is abused  by all sorts of Christians in the persecution of their enemies, and even  heretics affirm that they are practising Christian charity in  persecuting other heretics, I have sought for a term which might convey  to us a precise idea of doing good to our neighbours, and I can form  none more proper to make myself understood than the term of  _bienfaisance_, good-doing. Let those who like, use it; I would only be  understood, and it is not equivocal.\" The happy word was at first  criticised, but at length every kind heart found it responded to its own  feeling. Some verses from Voltaire, alluding to the political reveries  of the good abbe, notice the critical opposition; yet the new word  answered to the great rule of Horace.      Certain legislateur, dont la plume feconde    Fit tant de vains projets pour le bien du monde,    Et qui depuis trente ans ecrit pour des ingrats,    Vient de creer un mot qui manque a Vaugelas:    Ce mot est BIENFAISANCE; il me plait, il rassemble    Si le coeur en est cru, bien des vertus ensemble.    Petits grammairiens, grands precepteurs de sots,    Qui pesez la parole et mesurez les mots,    Pareille expression vous semble hazardee,    Mais l'univers entier doit en cherir l'idee!    The French revolutionists, in their rage for innovation, almost  barbarised the pure French of the Augustan age of their literature, as  they did many things which never before occurred; and sometimes  experienced feelings as transitory as they were strange. Their  nomenclature was copious; but the revolutionary jargon often shows the  danger and the necessity of neologisms. They form an appendix to the  Academy Dictionary. Our plain English has served to enrich this odd  mixture of philology and politics: _Club_, _clubiste_, _comite_, _jure_,  _juge de paix_, blend with their _terrorisme_, _lanterner_, a verb  active, _levee en masse_, _noyades_, and the other verb active,  _septembriser_, &c. The barbarous term _demoralisation_ is said to have  been the invention of the horrid capuchin Chabot; and the remarkable  expression of _arriere pensee_ belonged exclusively in its birth to the  jesuitic astuteness of the Abbe Sieyes, that political actor, who, in  changing sides, never required prompting in his new part!    A new word, the result of much consideration with its author, or a term  which, though unknown to the language, conveys a collective assemblage  of ideas by a fortunate designation, is a precious contribution of  genius; new words should convey new ideas.
