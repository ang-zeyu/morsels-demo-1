The  person commemorated is obviously Apollonius Tyaneus, a Pythagorean  philosopher and wonderworker, said to have been born about four years  before the Christian era.    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Elevation of a single compartment of the wall of  the Library discovered in Rome, 1883.    From notes and measurements made by Signor Lanciani and Prof. Middleton.]    A similar room was discovered at Herculaneum in 1754. A full account of  the discovery was drawn up at once by Signor Paderni, keeper of the  Herculaneum Museum, and addressed to Thomas Hollis, Esq., by whom it was  submitted to the Royal Society. I will extract, from this and subsequent  letters, the passages that bear upon my subject.                                         _Naples, 27 April, 1754._        ... The place where they are digging, at present, is      under _Il Bosco di Sant' Agostino_.... All the buildings      discover'd in this site are noble; ... in one there has      been found an entire library, compos'd of volumes of the      Egyptian Papyrus, of which there have been taken out      about 250....[54]                       _To the same._                                             _18 October, 1754._        ... As yet we have only entered into one room, the floor      of which is formed of mosaic work, not unelegant. It      appears to have been a library, adorned with presses,      inlaid with different sorts of wood, disposed in rows;      at the top of which were cornices, as in our own times.        I was buried in this spot more than twelve days, to      carry off the volumes found there; many of which were so      perished, that it was impossible to remove them. Those      which I took away amounted to the number of three      hundred and thirty-seven, all of them at present      uncapable of being opened. These are all written in      Greek characters. While I was busy in this work I      observed a large bundle, which, from the size, I      imagined must contain more than a single volume. I tried      with the utmost care to get it out, but could not, from      the damp and weight of it. However I perceived that it      consisted of about 18 volumes, each of which was in      length a palm and three Neapolitan inches, being the      largest hitherto discovered. They were wrapped about      with the bark of a tree and covered at each end with a      piece of wood. All these were written in Latin, as      appears by a few words which broke off from them. I was      in hopes to have got something out of them, but they are      in a worse condition than the Greek[55]....                       _From Sir J. Gray, Bart._                                             _29 October, 1754._        ... They have lately met with more rolls of Papyri of      different lengths and sizes, some with the _Umbilicus_      remaining in them: the greater part are Greek in small      capitals.... The Epicurean Philosophy is the subject of      another fragment.        A small bust of Epicurus, with his name in Greek      characters, was found in the same room, and was possibly      the ornament of that part of the library where the      writings in favour of his principles were kept; and it      may also be supposed that some other heads of      philosophers found in the same room were placed with the      same taste and propriety[56].    Between 1758 and 1763, the place was visited by Winckelmann, who wrote  long letters in Italian, describing what he saw, to Consigliere Bianconi,  Physician to the King of Saxony. One of these, dated 1762, gives the  following account of the library:        Ii luogo in cui per la prima volta caddero sott' occhio,      fu una piccola stanza nella villa d'Ercolano di cui      parlammo sopra, la cui lunghezza due uomini colle      braccia distese potevano misurare. Tutto all' intorno      del muro vi erano degli scaffali quali si vedono      ordinariamente negli archivi ad altezza d' uomo, e nel      mezzo della stanza v' era un altro scaffale simile o      tavola per tenervi scritture, e tale da potervi girare      intorno. Il legno di questa tavola era ridotto a      carboni, e cadde, come e facile ad imaginarselo, tutta      in pezzi quando si tocco. Alcuni di questi rotoli di      papiri si trovarono involti insieme con carta piu      grossolana, di quella qualita che gli antichi chiamavano      _emporetica_, e questi probabilmente formavano le parti      ed i libri d' un' opera intiera[57]....        The place in which they [the rolls] were first seen was      a small room in the villa at Herculaneum of which we      spoke above, the length of which could be covered by two      men with their arms extended. All round the wall there      were book-cases such as are commonly seen in      record-rooms, of a man's height, and in the middle of      the room there was another similar book-case or table to      hold writings, of such a size that one could go round      it. The wood of this table was reduced to charcoal, and,      as may easily be imagined, fell all to pieces when it      was touched. Some of these papyrus rolls were found      fastened together with paper of coarser texture, of that      quality which the ancients called _emporetica_, and      these probably formed the parts and books of an entire      work.    The information which these observers have given us amounts to this: the  room was about 12 feet long, with a floor of mosaic. Against the walls  stood presses, of a man's height, inlaid with different sorts of wood,  disposed in rows, with cornices at the top; and there was also a table, or  press, in the centre of the room. Most of the rolls were separate, but a  bundle of eighteen was found \"wrapped about with the bark of a tree, and  covered at each end with a piece of wood.\" A room so small as this could  hardly have been intended for study. It must rather have been the place  where the books were put away after they had been read elsewhere.    Before I quit this part of my subject, I should like to mention one other  building, as its arrangements throw light on the question of fitting up  libraries and record-offices. I allude to the structure built by  Vespasian, A.D. 78, to contain the documents relating to his restoration of  the city of Rome. It stood at the south-west corner of the Forum of Peace,  and what now exists of it is known as the Church of SS. Cosma e Damiano.    The general arrangement and relation to adjoining structures will be  understood from the plan (fig. 7). The room was about 125 feet long by 65  feet broad, with two entrances, one on the north-west, from the _Forum  Pacis_, through a hexastyle portico (fig. 7. 2), the other on the  north-east, through a square-headed doorway of travertine which still  exists (_ibid._ 1) together with a considerable portion of a massive wall  of Vespasian's time. After a restoration by Caracalla the building came to  be called _Templum Sacrae Urbis_. It was first consecrated as a church by  pope Felix IV. (526-530), but he did little more than connect it with the  _Heroon Romuli_ (_ibid._ 5), and build the apse (_ibid._ 4).    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Plan of the Record-House of Vespasian, with the  adjoining structures.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Part of the internal wall of the Record-House of  Vespasian.    Reduced from a sketch taken in the 16th century by Pirro Ligorio.]    The whole building was mercilessly mutilated by pope Urban VIII. in 1632;  but fortunately a drawing of the interior had been made by Pirro Ligorio  in the second half of the sixteenth century, when the original treatment  of the walls was practically intact. I give a reduced copy of a small  portion of this drawing (fig. 8). As Lanciani says:        The walls were divided into three horizontal bands by      finely cut cornices. The upper band was occupied by the      windows; the lower was simply lined with marble slabs      covered by the bookcases ... which contained the ...      records ...; the middle one was incrusted with      tarsia-work of the rarest kinds of marble with panels      representing panoplies, the wolf with the infant      founders of Rome, and other allegorical scenes[58].    I explained at the beginning of this chapter that my subject is the care  of books, not books themselves; but, at the point which we have now  reached in regard to Roman libraries, it is necessary to make a few  remarks about their contents. It must be remembered, in the first place,  that those who fitted them up had to deal with rolls (_volumina_),  probably of papyrus, but possibly of parchment; and that a book, as we  understand the word, the Latin equivalent for which was _codex_, did not  come into general use until long after the Christian era. Some points  about these rolls require notice.    The length and the width of the roll depended on the taste or convenience  of the writer[59]. The contents were written in columns, the lines of  which ran parallel to the long dimension[60], and the reader, holding the  roll in both hands, rolled up the part he had finished with his left hand,  and unrolled the unread portion with his right. This way of dealing with  the roll is well shewn in the accompanying illustration (fig. 9) reduced  from a fresco at Pompeii[61]. In most examples the two halves of the roll  are turned inwards, as for instance in the well-known statue of  Demosthenes in the Vatican[62]. The end of the roll was fastened to a  stick (usually referred to as _umbilicus_ or _umbilici_). It is obvious  that this word ought properly to denote the ends of the stick only, but it  was constantly applied to the whole stick, and not to a part of it, as for  instance in the following lines:        ... deus nam me vetat    Inceptos olim promissum carmen iambos      Ad umbilicum adducere[63].        ... for heaven forbids me to cover the scroll down to      the stick with the iambic lines I had begun a song      promised long ago to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#8)"],[1,"it diuretic and use it especially  in rheumatic affections.    The root of _S. carpinifolia_ gives a blue color with the salts of  iron. It does not precipitate gelatin and contains asparagin.    Botanical Description.--A plant 2-4° high with woody, branching stem,  leaves alternate, oblong, pointed, serrate, under surface neither  hoary nor tomentose as in some other species of _Sida_. Petioles  very short, curved near the leaf, 2 stipules near the base. Flowers  axillary, solitary. Calyx simple, in 5 parts. Corolla, 5 petals notched  obliquely. Stamens numerous, inserted on the end of a column. Anthers  globose. Styles 5, mingled with the stamens. Stigmas globose. Cells  of the same number as the styles, verticillate, with solitary seeds.    Habitat.--Common in Luzon, Panay, Mindanao, Paragua, Cebú and Balabac.        _Abutilon Indicum_, Don.

Uses.--The trunk bark is slightly bitter, and in decoction is used  as a diuretic. An infusion of the leaves and flowers is used as an  emollient in place of mallows. The infusion of the root is used for  the same effect, as a lotion or injection. I have often had occasion  to employ this plant and would never use the _Philippine mallow_  in place of it.    Botanical Description.--A plant 3-4° high, all its parts covered with  hairs, simple and tomentose. Leaves heart-shaped, angular, obtuse,  unequally serrate, smooth, soft, the lower surface hoary and bearing  9 well-marked nerves. Petioles longer than the leaves, with 2 stipules  at the base. Flowers yellow, axillary, solitary. Peduncles long, with  a node near the end. Calyx, 5 sepals, as in all the Malvaceæ. Corolla,  5 petals with a small notch at the end. Stamens very numerous as well  as the styles. Both arise from the summit of a very short column and  twist in all directions forming a tassel or tuft. Fruit much higher  than the calyx, of 10-20 cells or carpels which are broad, compressed,  hairy, the walls united toward the center, each containing 2-3 seeds.    Habitat.--Common in Luzon, Panay, Mindanao and other islands. Blooms  in September.        _Urena sinuata_, L. (_U. morifolia_ and _muricata_, DC.;  _U. multifida_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kulutan_, _Kulutkulutan_, _Molopolo_, Tag., Vis., Pam.    Uses.--The infusion of the root is used internally as an emollient  and refrigerant; externally in skin diseases accompanied by smarting  and inflammation. The boiled and pounded leaves are used as a poultice  in inflammation of the intestines and bladder.    Botanical Description.--A spreading plant 4-6° high, with straight  stem, leaves cleft at the base, serrate and hairy; the larger ones  have 5-6 lobules which subdivide into smaller ones and bear a small  gland in the inferior surface of the midrib. Petioles short. Flowers  terminal and racemose. Calyx double, composed of 5 narrow sepals  externally, and 5 colored sepals internally alternating with the  outer ones. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens numerous, inserted about a  small column. Styles 10, on the end of the column. Stigmas thick,  covered with little spheres. Five united carpels, kidney-shaped,  bristling with short stiff hairs, containing solitary seeds.    Habitat.--Common in all parts of the Archipelago.        _Hibiscus Abelmoschus, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Kastuli_, _Kastio_, _Kastiogan_, _Dalupan_, Tag.;  _Marikum_, _Dukum_, _Marukum_, _Marapoto_, Vis.; [2] _Marsh Mallow_,  Eng.    Uses.--The bruised seeds emit an odor of musk, and for this reason  the plant has received the name _Kastuli_, signifying musk in  Sanscrit. They possess antispasmodic and stimulant properties, and the  infusion is diuretic. Bonastre [3] analyzed Kastuli seeds as follows:              Water and parenchyma                    52.00          Gum                                     36.00          Albumin                                  5.60          Fixed oil, resin, crystals and          odorous principles                       6.40                                                 ------              Total                              100.00      The fixed oil is greenish-yellow, fluid, but gradually solidifying  in the air. The crystalline material is white, of an agreeable odor,  soluble in ether, where it crystallizes in rays, fusible at 35°. The  odorous principle is a bright green, non-volatile liquid of the odor  of musk.    Botanical Description.--A plant 5-6° high, the stem hairy and with  few branches. Leaves heart-shaped, cleft at the base, with 5 large  pointed lobes, serrate, pubescent. Petioles long with two awl-shaped  stipules at the base, and a large violet spot in the axil.

Stamens very numerous,  inserted around a column. One pistil. Five stigmas. Ovary very large,  downy, ovoid, 5-angled, with 5 compartments, each containing many  kidney-shaped seeds with numerous grooves concentric at the hilum.    Habitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.        _Hibiscus tiliaceus, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Balibago_, Tag., Pam.; _Malabago_, Vis.    Uses.--An infusion of the leaves is used as a wash for ulcers and  indolent sores. The flowers boiled in milk are used to relieve the  pain of earache (Blanco), the warm milk being dropped into the external  canal. The powdered bark in dose of 3 grams is emetic(?) (Blanco).    Botanical Description.--A small tree 6-12° high with leaves 4-6' long,  alternate, 7-nerved, cleft at the base, abruptly acute, scalloped,  pubescent. Petioles long. Flowers axillary, in panicles of very small  flowerets. Calyx double, the outer portion divided into 8-9 teeth,  the inner into 5 longer parts. Stamens numerous, inserted about a  column. Style 1. Stigmas 5. Ovary of 5 cells, each containing 2 seeds.    Habitat.--Abounds in all parts of the islands.        _Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Takurangan_, _Aronganan_, _Kayanga_, _Tapulanga_,  _Gumamila_, Tag., Vis., Pam.; _Rose of China_, Eng.    Uses.--The flowers are emollient and are widely used by the Filipinos  as a domestic remedy; they are bruised and applied to boils, tumors  and all sorts of inflammations. The decoction is much used internally  in bronchial catarrh for its sudorific effect.    The Chinese use the trunk bark as an emmenagogue, calling it  Fu-yong-pi.    Botanical Description.--A small tree about 7° high commonly called  _Gumamela_ in Manila; the leaves are ovate, acute, with about 5 nerves,  serrate from the middle to the apex, hairs growing sparsely on both  surfaces, with a small group of dark-colored, deciduous hairs growing  on the lower part of the midrib. Petioles short with 2 stipules at  the base. Calyx double, the outer part divided almost to the base  into 6-8 parts; the inner cylindrical, divided in 5. Corolla large,  splendid scarlet-red, often double, on slender peduncles. Styles  numerous. Fruit identical with that of the _Hibiscus tiliaceus_.    Habitat.--Universally common in the Philippines.        _Thespesia populnea_, Corr.    Nom. Vulg.--_Babuy_ or _Bobuy gubat_, Tag.; _Bulakan_, Vis.    Uses.--The fruit yields a yellow juice which is used locally in  the itch and other cutaneous troubles, after first washing the  affected part with a decoction of the roots and leaves. The bark is  astringent and is used as a decoction in the treatment of dysentery  and hemorrhoids.    Botanical Description.--A tree of the second order with leaves 4-5'  long, sparse, 5-nerved, heart-shaped, broad, acute, entire, glabrous,  6 small glands on the lower face of the base. Petioles of equal length  with the leaves. Flowers large, axillary, solitary. Calyx double,  the outer portion deciduous, consisting of 3 small, acute leaflets  inserted on the base of the inner calyx; the inner is bell-shaped,  larger than the outer, with 5 inconspicuous, persistent teeth. Corolla  four times longer than the calyx, of 5 fleshy, fluted petals, their  borders overlapping, much broader above. Stamens very numerous,  arranged around and along a column. Filaments long. Anthers of  half-moon shape. Style 1, very thick. Stigma cleft in 5 parts, which  are twisted in spiral form. Seed vessels about the size of a filbert,  5-sided, with 5 apartments each containing 5 ovoid seeds attached  by separate seed stalks to the central axis of the ovary. Seeds  not woolly.    Habitat.--Mandaloya Tayabas, Iloilo.        _Gossypium herbaceum_, L. (_G. Indicum_, Lam.; _G. Capas_, Rumph.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Algodón_, Sp.; _Bulak_, Tag.; _Cotton_, Eng.    Uses.--The root bark is antiasthmatic, emmenagogue, and according  to Daruty [4] is a substitute for ergot in uterine hemorrhage. The  leaves are used in bronchial troubles and the seeds are sudorific. The  negroes in the United States use the root bark in large doses as an  abortifacient; but a dose of 60 grams to 1,200 of water in decoction  is proper and useful in treating dysmenorrhoea.    For a long time the seeds went to waste but industry has learned to  obtain from them a brownish-red oil which is used as a substitute for  olive oil, from which it is hard to distinguish it, if the latter  is adulterated by mixing the two; for both have the same density  and a very similar odor and taste. For this reason the production  of cottonseed oil is very considerable nowadays. It is cheap and  excellent for domestic, industrial and pharmaceutic use.    The seeds are used in North America in dysentery and as a galactagogue,  and the juice of the leaves as an emollient in diarrhoea and mild  dysentery. The pulp of the seeds, after the oil is extracted, yields  a sweet material called _gossypose_, which is dextrogyrous and has  the formula C_18_H_32_O_16_ + 5H_2_O.
