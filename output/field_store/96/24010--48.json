Some were tossed about by the winds and waves for many  long years, and suffered shipwrecks. Others reached home safely, only to  be murdered by relatives who had taken possession of their thrones  during their long absence.    [Illustration: Vase.]    [Illustration: Jug.]    [Illustration: Cup.]    Only a few among these heroes escaped with their lives, and wandered off  to other countries to found new cities. Thus arose many Greek colonies  in Sicily and southern Italy, which were called Great Greece, in honor  of the country from which the first settlers had come.    As you have already seen, Prince AEneas was among these Trojans. After  many exciting adventures, which you will be able to read in the \"Story  of Rome,\" he sailed up the Ti'ber River, and landed near the place where  one of his descendants was to found the present capital of Italy, which  is one of the most famous cities in the world.          XIX. HEROIC DEATH OF CODRUS.      You remember, do you not, how the sons of Pelops had driven the  Heraclidae, or sons of Hercules, out of the peninsula which was called  the Peloponnesus? This same peninsula is now called Mo-re'a, or the  mulberry leaf, because it is shaped something like such a leaf, as you  will see by looking at your map.    The Heraclidae had not gone away willingly, but were staying in Thessaly,  in the northern part of Greece, where they promised to remain one  hundred years without making any attempt to come back.    Shortly after the end of the Trojan War, this truce of a hundred years  came to an end; and the Heraclidae called upon their neighbors the  Dorians to join them, and help them win back their former lands.    Led by three brave chiefs, the allies passed through Greece proper,  along the Isthmus of Corinth, and, spreading all over the Peloponnesus,  soon took possession of the principal towns. The leading members of the  family of Hercules took the title of kings, and ruled over the cities of  Argos, Mycenae, and Spar'ta.    The Dorians, who had helped the Heraclidae win back their former  possessions, now saw that the land here was better than their home in  the mountains, so they drove all the rest of the Ionians out of the  country, and settled there also.    Thus driven away by the Dorians and the Heraclidae, these Ionians went to  Athens, to the neighboring islands, and even to the coast of Asia Minor,  south of the ruined city of Troy, where they settled in great numbers.  They called the strip of land which they occupied Ionia, and founded  many towns, some of which, such as Eph'e-sus and Mi-le'tus, were  destined to become famous.    Of course, the Ionians were very angry at thus being driven away from  home; and those who had gone to live in Athens soon asked Co'drus, the  Athenian king, to make war against the Heraclidae of Sparta.    The two armies soon met, and prepared for battle. Codrus, having  consulted an oracle, had learned that the victory would be given to the  army whose king should be killed, so he nobly made up his mind to die  for the good of his people.    Instead of going into battle in royal dress, with his guards all around  him, as was his habit, he dressed himself like an ordinary soldier, and  went forward until he stood in the very first rank of the army. Then he  rushed boldly into the midst of the foe.    Of course, he was soon cut down; but the Athenians, seeing his courage,  and learning why he had thus risked his life, fought with such valor  that they defeated the Spar'tan forces, and forced them to retreat.    The victory had been won; but the Athenians were so sorry to lose their  beloved king, that they could not rejoice, and sadly returned home,  carrying the body of Codrus. Such was the admiration of all the people  for this act of royal courage, that they vowed they would never again  call any one by the name of king.    When Codrus had been buried, therefore, the Athenians gave his son and  heir the government of the city, calling him archon, or chief for  life,--a title which was borne by many rulers after him.    The Spartans, who had come into Attica to fight the Athenians, retreated  hastily after their defeat, and returned to their city, where they  settled, forcing all the people who dwelt in the neighborhood either to  leave the country or to serve them as their slaves.    The return of the Heraclidae into the Peloponnesus is the last event of  the Heroic Age, and now real history begins. After this, it is no longer  necessary to try to find out the truth hidden in the old tales which  were handed down from father to son, and which were the only fairy  stories the Greek children knew; for henceforth records were kept of all  the principal events.          XX. THE BLIND POET.      Three or four centuries after the siege of Troy, there lived a poor old  blind poet who wandered about from place to place, playing upon his  lyre, and reciting wonderful verses which told about the adventures of  the Greek heroes, and their great deeds during the Trojan War.    We are told that this old man, whose name was Ho'mer, had not always  been poor and blind, but that, having embarked by mistake upon a vessel  manned by pirates, he not only had been robbed of all his wealth, and  blinded, but had been left upon a lonely shore.    By some happy chance, poor blind Homer found his way to the inhabited  parts of the country, where he soon won many friends. Instead of  spending all his time in weeping over his troubles, Homer tried to think  of some way in which he could earn his living, and at the same time give  pleasure to others. He soon found such a way in telling the stories of  the past to all who cared to listen to them.    [Illustration: Homer.]    As the people in those days had no books, no schools, and no theaters,  these stories seemed very wonderful. Little by little Homer turned them  into verses so grand and beautiful that we admire them still; and these  he recited, accompanying himself on a lyre, which he handled with much  skill. As he wandered thus from place to place, old and young crowded  around him to listen to his tales; and some young men were so struck by  them that they followed him everywhere, until they too could repeat  them. This was quite easy to do, because Homer had put them into the  most beautiful and harmonious language the world has ever known. As soon  as these young men had learned a few of the tales, they too began to  travel from place to place, telling them to all they met; and thus  Homer's verses became well known throughout all Greece.    [Illustration: Telling Homer's Tales.]    The Greeks who could recite Homer's poems went next to the islands and  Asia Minor, stopping at every place where Greek was spoken, to tell  about the wrath of Achilles, the death of Patroclus, Hector, or old  Priam, the burning of Troy, the wanderings of Ulysses, and the return of  the Greeks. Other youths learned the poems; and so, although they were  not written down for many a year, they were constantly recited and sung,  and thus kept alive in the memory of the people.    As for Homer, their author, we know but little about him. We are told  that he lived to be very old, and that although he was poor as long as  he lived, and forced to earn his living by reciting his songs, he was  greatly honored after his death.    His two great heroic poems--the Iliad, telling all about the Trojan War,  and the Od'ys-sey, relating how Ulysses sailed about for ten years on  his way home from Troy--were finally written down, and kept so carefully  that they can still be read to-day. Such was the admiration felt for  these poems, that some years after Homer's death an attempt was made to  find out more about him, and about the place where he was born.    Fifty cities claimed the honor of giving him birth; but, although it was  never positively found out where he was born, most people thought the  Island of Chi'os was his birthplace. The Greek towns, wishing to show  how much they admired the works of Homer, used to send yearly gifts to  this place, the native land of the grandest poet the world has ever  known.          XXI. THE RISE OF SPARTA.      The city of Sparta, founded in the days of the Pelasgians, and once  ruled over by Menelaus and Helen, had fallen, as we have seen, into the  hands of the Heraclidae when they came back to the Peloponnesus after  their exile of a hundred years. It was first governed by  A-ris-to-de'mus, one of their three leaders; and, as records soon began  to be kept, we know a great deal about the early history of this famous  place.    As the town had formerly belonged to the Heraclidae, and had been ruled  by one of their ancestors, called Lac-e-dae'mon, they called it by his  name, and the country around it they named La-co'ni-a. Having won back  the town by fighting, the Heraclidae said that they would attend to war  and politics, and make the conquered people till the ground.    The old inhabitants of Laconia, therefore, went on living in the  country, where they sowed and harvested for the benefit of the Spartans.  All the prisoners of war, however, became real slaves. They were obliged  to serve the Spartans in every way, and were called He'lots.    When Aristodemus died, his twin sons were both made kings; and, as each  of them left his throne to his descendants, Sparta had two kings,  instead of one, from this time on. One member of the royal family,  although he never bore the name of king, is the most noted man in  Spartan history. This is Ly-cur'gus, the son of one ruler, the brother  of another, and the guardian of an infant king named Char-i-la'us.    Lycurgus was a thoroughly good and upright man. We are told that the  mother of the baby king once offered to put her child to death that  Lycurgus might reign. Fearing for the babe's safety, Lycurgus made  believe that he agreed to this plan, and asked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#8)"],[1,"in birds of this species.  It is only  in the woods, and when freshly caught or killed, that these brilliant  tints can be seen to perfection.  They fade in captivity, and  immediately after the bird has been shot.  They seem to form part of its  life and liberty, and disappear when it is robbed of either.  I have  often thrust the wild pigeon, freshly killed, into my game-bag,  glittering like an opal.  I have drawn it forth a few hours after of a  dull leaden hue, and altogether unlike the same bird.    As with all birds of this tribe, the female is inferior to the male,  both in size and plumage.  The eye is less vivid.  In the male it is of  the most brilliant fiery orange, inclosed in a well-defined circle of  red.  The eye is in truth its finest feature, and never fails to strike  the beholder with admiration.    The most singular fact in the natural history of the \"passenger,\" is  their countless numbers.  Audubon saw a flock that contained \"one  billion one hundred and sixteen millions of birds!\"  Wilson counted, or  rather computed, another flock of \"two thousand two hundred and thirty  millions!\"  These numbers seem incredible.  I have no doubt of their  truth.  I have no doubt that they are _under_ rather than _over_ the  numbers actually seen by both these naturalists, for both made most  liberal allowances in their calculations.    Where do these immense flocks come from?    The wild pigeons breed in all parts of America.  Their breeding-places  are found as far north as the Hudson's Bay, and they have been seen in  the southern forests of Louisiana and Texas.  The nests are built upon  high trees, and resemble immense rookeries.  In Kentucky, one of their  breeding-places was forty miles in length, by several in breadth!  One  hundred nests will often be found upon a single tree, and in each nest  there is but one \"squab.\"  The eggs are pure white, like those of the  common kind, and, like them, they breed several times during the year,  but principally when food is plenty.  They establish themselves in great  \"roosts,\" sometimes for years together, to which each night they return  from their distant excursions--hundreds of miles, perhaps; for this is  but a short fly for travellers who can pass over a mile in a single  minute, and some of whom have even strayed across the Atlantic to  England!  They, however, as I myself have observed, remain in the same  woods where they have been feeding for several days together.  I have  also noticed that they prefer roosting in the low underwood, even when  tall trees are close at hand.  If near water, or hanging over a stream,  the place is still more to their liking; and in the morning they may be  seen alighting on the bank to drink, before taking to their daily  occupation.    The great \"roosts\" and breeding-places are favourite resorts for  numerous birds of prey.  The small vultures (_Cathartes aura_ and  _Atratus_), or, as they are called in the west, \"turkey buzzard,\" and  \"carrion crow,\" do not confine themselves to carrion alone.  They are  fond of live \"squabs,\" which they drag out of their nests at pleasure.  Numerous hawks and kites prey upon them; and even the great white-headed  eagle (_Falco leucocephalus_) may be seen soaring above, and  occasionally swooping down for a dainty morsel.  On the ground beneath  move enemies of a different kind, both biped and quadruped.  Fowlers  with their guns and long poles; farmers with waggons to carry off the  dead birds; and even droves of hogs to devour them.  Trees fall under  the axe, and huge branches break down by the weight of the birds  themselves, killing numbers in their descent.  Torches are used--for it  is usually a night scene, after the return of the birds from feeding,--  pots of burning sulphur, and other engines of destruction.  A noisy  scene it is.  The clapping of a million pair of wings, like the roaring  of thunder; the shots; the shouts; men hoarsely calling to each other;  women and children screaming their delight; the barking of dogs; the  neighing of horses; the \"crashes\" of breaking branches; and the \"chuck\"  of the woodman's axe, all mingled together.    When the men--saturated with slaughter, and white with ordure--have  retired beyond the borders of the roost to rest themselves for the  night, their ground is occupied by the prowling wolf and the fox; the  racoon and the cougar; the lynx and the great black bear.    With so many enemies, one would think that the \"passengers\" would soon  be exterminated.  Not so.  They are too prolific for that.  Indeed, were  it not for these enemies, they themselves would perish for want of food.  Fancy what it takes to feed them!  The flock seen by Wilson would  require eighteen million bushels of grain every day!--and it, most  likely, was only one of many such that at the time were traversing the  vast continent of America.  Upon what do they feed? it will be asked.  Upon the fruits of the great forest--upon the acorns, the nuts of the  beech, upon buck-wheat, and Indian corn; upon many species of berries,  such as the huckleberry (_whortleberry_), the hackberry (_Celtis  crassifolia_), and the fruit of the holly.  In the northern regions,  where these are scarce, the berries of the juniper tree (_Juniperus  communis_) form the principal food.  On the other hand, among the  southern plantations, they devour greedily the rice, as well as the nuts  of the chestnut-tree and several species of oaks.  But their staple food  is the beech-nut, or \"mast,\" as it is called.  Of this the pigeons are  fond, and fortunately it exists in great plenty.  In the forests of  Western America there are vast tracts covered almost entirely with the  beech-tree.    As already stated, these beechen forests of America remain almost  intact, and so long as they shower down their millions of bushels of  \"mast,\" so long will the passenger-pigeons flutter in countless numbers  amidst their branches.    Their migration is semi-annual; but unlike most other migratory birds,  it is far from being regular.  Their flight is, in fact, not a  periodical migration, but a sort of nomadic existence--food being the  object which keeps them in motion and directs their course.  The  scarcity in one part determines their movement to another.  When there  is more than the usual fall of snow in the northern regions, vast flocks  make their appearance in the middle States, as in Ohio and Kentucky.  This may in some measure account for the overcrowded \"roosts\" which have  been occasionally seen, but which are by no means common.  You may live  in the west for many years without witnessing a scene such as those  described by Wilson and Audubon, though once or twice every year you may  see pigeons enough to astonish you.    It must not be imagined that the wild pigeons of America are so \"tame\"  as they have been sometimes represented.  That is their character only  while young at the breeding-places, or at the great roosts when confused  by crowding upon each other, and mystified by torch-light.    Far different are they when wandering through the open woods in search  of food.  It is then both difficult to approach and hard to kill them.  Odd birds you may easily reach; you may see them perched upon the  branches on all sides of you, and within shot-range; but the _thick_ of  the flock, somehow or other, always keeps from one to two hundred yards  off.  The sportsman cannot bring himself to fire at single birds.  No.  There is a tree near at hand literally black with pigeons.  Its branches  creak under the weight.  What a fine havoc he will make if he can but  get near enough!  But that is the difficulty; there is no cover, and he  must approach as he best can without it.  He continues to advance; the  birds sit silent, watching his movements.  He treads lightly and with  caution; he inwardly anathematises the dead leaves and twigs that make a  loud rustling under his feet.  The birds appear restless; several  stretch out their necks as if to spring off.    At length he deems himself fairly within range, and raises his gun to  take aim; but this is a signal for the shy game, and before he can draw  trigger they are off to another tree!    Some stragglers still remain; and at them he levels his piece and fires.  The shot is a random one; for our sportsman, having failed to \"cover\"  the flock, has become irritated and careless, and in all such cases the  pigeons fly off with the loss of a few feathers.    The gun is reloaded, and our amateur hunter, seeing the thick flock upon  another tree, again endeavours to approach it, but with like success.        CHAPTER FIVE.    HUNT WITH A HOWITZER.    When the conversation about the haunts and habits of these birds began  to flag, some one called for a \"pigeon story.\"  Who could tell a pigeon  story?  To our surprise the doctor volunteered one, and all gathered  around to listen.    \"Yes, gentlemen,\" began the doctor, \"I have a pigeon adventure, which  occurred to me some years ago.  I was then living in Cincinnati,  following my respectable calling, when I had the good fortune to set a  broken leg for one Colonel P--, a wealthy planter, who lived upon the  bank of the river some sixty miles from the city.  I made a handsome set  of if, and won the colonel's friendship for ever.  Shortly after, I was  invited to his house, to be present at a great pigeon-hunt which was to  come off in the fall.  The colonel's plantation stood among beech woods,  and he had therefore an annual visitation of the pigeons, and could tell  almost to a day when they would appear.  The hunt he had arranged for  the gratification of his numerous friends.    \"As you all know, gentlemen, sixty miles in our western travel is a mere  bagatelle; and tired of pills and prescriptions, I flung myself into a  boat, and in a few hours arrived at the colonel's stately home.  A word  or two about this stately home and its proprietor.    \"Colonel P-- was a splendid"]]]
