Your loving Cousin,    EDWARD KIGHTLEY.      The Rebellion in Ireland and our Battell were both the 23 of October.          II.    The Geology of Edge Hill.      The Geology of the Edge Hill region presents points of study to the  student of the physical phases of the science rather than to the  palaeontologist, though it does not appear in either case that the  conditions presented are difficult to read. Beginning with the low range  of hills three miles N.W. of Kineton, forming the Trias outcrop, and  fringed with a thin development of Rhaetics, we cross the broad plain of  the Lower Lias almost without undulation, save in the ridge which  stretches from Gaydon to Butler's Marston, until the foot of Edge Hill  itself is reached. Fragments of Ammonites of the _rotiformis_ type are  occasionally ploughed up in the plain, and the railway cutting at North  End has yielded specimens of _Ammonites semicostatus_. The hill slopes are  in the main formed of the clays and shales of the Middle Lias, the Zone of  _Ammonites margaritatus_ with certain characteristic fossils, _Cypricardia  cucullata_, &c., appearing in the old brickyard at Arlescot. There is no  other exposure of the seleniferous shales of the zone; their course is  masked by a rich belt of woodland. The natural terraces somewhat  characteristic of this horizon in the midlands are roughly developed  towards the Sun Rising, and are more perfectly shown at Hadsham hollow in  the Hornton vale. At Shenington, four miles southward, there are some  beautifully terraced fields, one locally known as Rattlecombe Slade  recalling to mind the lynchets of the Inferior Oolite sands of  Dorsetshire. They are in the main terraces of drainage, the step-like form  of subsidence being due to the composition of the seleniferous marls and  under waste. The terraces are of exceptional regularity, and run parallel  to the lines of drainage; in one case, however (Kenhill), in the same  locality, they form a bay or recess on the hill slope. A familiar instance  of the last phase is to be seen at the Bear Garden, Banbury. The salient  feature of the Edge Hill escarpment is the Marlstone rock-bed, the  uppermost division of the Middle Lias. Several sections in this zone  (_Ammonites spinatus_) may be seen near the Round House. It has three main  divisions: The upper red layers the roadstone, the middle of several green  hard beds called top-rag, and the lower courses of dark green softer  stone, the best rag (used for building). Some of the quarries have been  worked for centuries, and the grey green slabs of Hornton stone, its local  name, are familiar on the hearths and in the homes of nearly the whole  country-side. At this its N.W. outcrop, the rock thickens considerably,  attaining a development of about twenty-four feet. The stone itself is a  ferruginous limestone, greenish when unweathered, otherwise of a rich red  brown colour. Good evidence of its durability as a building material is  shewn in the fine fourteenth century churches of North Oxon, which are  almost without exception built of the stone. Near the Beacon House on the  Burton Dassett Hills, a good section is exposed in which fossils are found  more freely. Amongst the brachiopod shells _Waldhemia indentata_,  _Terebratula punctata_, _T. Edwardsii_ occur, together with an abundance  of the characteristic _Rhynchonella tetraedra_: _Spiriferinae_ are rare.  When the ironstone workings were extended, ten years or so since, large  _Pholadomya ambigua_ and other shells were obtainable from some sandy beds  at the base of the series. Capping the \"spinatus\" beds are a few feet of  Upper Lias Clay belonging to the zone of _Ammonites serpentinus_, and  fragments of the Ammonites common to the horizon are scattered about; but  these beds are not found along the escarpment east of Shenloe Hill.    By the roadside leading from Burton Dassett to Fenny Compton, a small  quarry on the south side shows a patch of Inferior Oolite. A fault has  preserved this the only remnant to prove the former extension of the  Bajocian beds over the area of the Burton and Edge Hills. Tysoe Hill, four  miles S.W. of the Round House, and the hills which fringe the borderland  of Warwickshire and Oxon, are nearly all capped with sands or limestones  of the Inferior Oolite, and occasionally with the marly limestones of the  Great Oolite also.

BANBURY CROSS.--A fine hexagonal Gothic structure, fifty feet in height,  was erected from the designs of the architect, Mr. John Gibbs, in 1859, in  commemoration of the marriage of the Princess Royal with Prince Frederick  William of Prussia. On the buttresses of the lower stage are painted the  municipal seals of old Banbury. Between the buttresses are pedestals  intended to receive statues. Statues of the late Queen, Oliver Cromwell,  and Whateley would complete the beauty of the structure if accompanied by  the removal of the palisading. The upper panels are enriched with  conventional ornaments of vine, ivy, rose, and other flowers, and bear the  arms or cyphers of Queens Mary and Victoria, Kings Charles I. and George  I., the Princess William of Prussia, the Earls of Banbury and Guildford,  Viscount Saye and Sele, Sir William Cope, Sir William Compton, the Bishop  of Lincoln, and the Rev. W. Whateley. The celebrated old Cross is believed  to have stood near the site of the present one, and was destroyed about  the year 1602, at which time it went ill with the other Crosses which  formerly adorned the town, owing to excesses of religious zeal. The High  Cross mentioned in King Ed. VI.'s reign is probably the same as The Bread  Cross repaired in 1563, on the site of which the present Cross is supposed  to be. Of the White Cross \"outside Sugarford\" (West) Bar and of the Market  Cross no more can be said. From a passage in Leland's Itinerary, it  appears that the Cross was of some note, and from the old nursery rhyme,  \"Ride a cock-horse,\" &c., if from no more veracious record, it seems that  it was honoured by an occasional pageant.    THE PARISH CHURCH (ST. MARY'S).--The old church, of which there is  abundant record in engravings and contemporary drawings, stood on the  ground where now is the new church. Of fine proportions and good style,  its destruction (1790) appears to have been an ill-judged measure. It had  a massive west tower, embattled and crowned by eight ornamented pinnacles  and a series of beautiful windows on the south and south-east sides. Its  chantry of St. Mary was founded in 1413, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296"],[0,"The Confessions of St. Augustine (#8)"],[1,"heart was void of truth. Yet they cried out \"Truth,  Truth,\" and spake much thereof to me, yet it was not in them: but they  spake falsehood, not of Thee only (who truly art Truth), but even of  those elements of this world, Thy creatures. And I indeed ought to have  passed by even philosophers who spake truth concerning them, for love  of Thee, my Father, supremely good, Beauty of all things beautiful.  O Truth, Truth, how inwardly did even then the marrow of my soul pant  after Thee, when they often and diversely, and in many and huge books,  echoed of Thee to me, though it was but an echo? And these were the  dishes wherein to me, hungering after Thee, they, instead of Thee,  served up the Sun and Moon, beautiful works of Thine, but yet Thy works,  not Thyself, no nor Thy first works. For Thy spiritual works are before  these corporeal works, celestial though they be, and shining. But I  hungered and thirsted not even after those first works of Thine, but  after Thee Thyself, the Truth, in whom is no variableness, neither  shadow of turning: yet they still set before me in those dishes,  glittering fantasies, than which better were it to love this very sun  (which is real to our sight at least), than those fantasies which by  our eyes deceive our mind. Yet because I thought them to be Thee, I fed  thereon; not eagerly, for Thou didst not in them taste to me as Thou  art; for Thou wast not these emptinesses, nor was I nourished by them,  but exhausted rather. Food in sleep shows very like our food awake; yet  are not those asleep nourished by it, for they are asleep. But those  were not even any way like to Thee, as Thou hast now spoken to me; for  those were corporeal fantasies, false bodies, than which these true  bodies, celestial or terrestrial, which with our fleshly sight we  behold, are far more certain: these things the beasts and birds discern  as well as we, and they are more certain than when we fancy them. And  again, we do with more certainty fancy them, than by them conjecture  other vaster and infinite bodies which have no being. Such empty husks  was I then fed on; and was not fed. But Thou, my soul's Love, in looking  for whom I fail, that I may become strong, art neither those bodies  which we see, though in heaven; nor those which we see not there; for  Thou hast created them, nor dost Thou account them among the chiefest of  Thy works. How far then art Thou from those fantasies of mine, fantasies  of bodies which altogether are not, than which the images of those  bodies, which are, are far more certain, and more certain still the  bodies themselves, which yet Thou art not; no, nor yet the soul, which  is the life of the bodies. So then, better and more certain is the life  of the bodies than the bodies. But Thou art the life of souls, the life  of lives, having life in Thyself; and changest not, life of my soul.    Where then wert Thou then to me, and how far from me? Far verily was I  straying from Thee, barred from the very husks of the swine, whom with  husks I fed. For how much better are the fables of poets and grammarians  than these snares? For verses, and poems, and \"Medea flying,\" are more  profitable truly than these men's five elements, variously disguised,  answering to five dens of darkness, which have no being, yet slay the  believer. For verses and poems I can turn to true food, and \"Medea  flying,\" though I did sing, I maintained not; though I heard it sung,  I believed not: but those things I did believe. Woe, woe, by what steps  was I brought down to the depths of hell! toiling and turmoiling through  want of Truth, since I sought after Thee, my God (to Thee I confess  it, who hadst mercy on me, not as yet confessing), not according to the  understanding of the mind, wherein Thou willedst that I should excel  the beasts, but according to the sense of the flesh. But Thou wert more  inward to me than my most inward part; and higher than my highest. I  lighted upon that bold woman, simple and knoweth nothing, shadowed out  in Solomon, sitting at the door, and saying, Eat ye bread of secrecies  willingly, and drink ye stolen waters which are sweet: she seduced me,  because she found my soul dwelling abroad in the eye of my flesh, and  ruminating on such food as through it I had devoured.    For other than this, that which really is I knew not; and was, as it  were through sharpness of wit, persuaded to assent to foolish deceivers,  when they asked me, \"whence is evil?\" \"is God bounded by a bodily shape,  and has hairs and nails?\" \"are they to be esteemed righteous who had  many wives at once, and did kill men, and sacrifice living creatures?\"  At which I, in my ignorance, was much troubled, and departing from the  truth, seemed to myself to be making towards it; because as yet I knew  not that evil was nothing but a privation of good, until at last a thing  ceases altogether to be; which how should I see, the sight of whose eyes  reached only to bodies, and of my mind to a phantasm? And I knew not God  to be a Spirit, not one who hath parts extended in length and breadth,  or whose being was bulk; for every bulk is less in a part than in the  whole: and if it be infinite, it must be less in such part as is defined  by a certain space, than in its infinitude; and so is not wholly every  where, as Spirit, as God. And what that should be in us, by which we  were like to God, and might be rightly said to be after the image of  God, I was altogether ignorant.    Nor knew I that true inward righteousness which judgeth not according  to custom, but out of the most rightful law of God Almighty, whereby  the ways of places and times were disposed according to those times and  places; itself meantime being the same always and every where, not one  thing in one place, and another in another; according to which Abraham,  and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and David, were righteous, and all  those commended by the mouth of God; but were judged unrighteous by  silly men, judging out of man's judgment, and measuring by their own  petty habits, the moral habits of the whole human race. As if in an  armory, one ignorant what were adapted to each part should cover his  head with greaves, or seek to be shod with a helmet, and complain that  they fitted not: or as if on a day when business is publicly stopped in  the afternoon, one were angered at not being allowed to keep open shop,  because he had been in the forenoon; or when in one house he observeth  some servant take a thing in his hand, which the butler is not suffered  to meddle with; or something permitted out of doors, which is forbidden  in the dining-room; and should be angry, that in one house, and one  family, the same thing is not allotted every where, and to all. Even  such are they who are fretted to hear something to have been lawful  for righteous men formerly, which now is not; or that God, for certain  temporal respects, commanded them one thing, and these another, obeying  both the same righteousness: whereas they see, in one man, and one day,  and one house, different things to be fit for different members, and  a thing formerly lawful, after a certain time not so; in one corner  permitted or commanded, but in another rightly forbidden and punished.  Is justice therefore various or mutable? No, but the times, over which  it presides, flow not evenly, because they are times. But men whose days  are few upon the earth, for that by their senses they cannot harmonise  the causes of things in former ages and other nations, which they had  not experience of, with these which they have experience of, whereas in  one and the same body, day, or family, they easily see what is fitting  for each member, and season, part, and person; to the one they take  exceptions, to the other they submit.    These things I then knew not, nor observed; they struck my sight on all  sides, and I saw them not. I indited verses, in which I might not place  every foot every where, but differently in different metres; nor even in  any one metre the self-same foot in all places. Yet the art itself, by  which I indited, had not different principles for these different cases,  but comprised all in one. Still I saw not how that righteousness, which  good and holy men obeyed, did far more excellently and sublimely contain  in one all those things which God commanded, and in no part varied;  although in varying times it prescribed not every thing at once, but  apportioned and enjoined what was fit for each. And I in my blindness,  censured the holy Fathers, not only wherein they made use of things  present as God commanded and inspired them, but also wherein they were  foretelling things to come, as God was revealing in them.    Can it at any time or place be unjust to love God with all his heart,  with all his soul, and with all his mind; and his neighbour as himself?  Therefore are those foul offences which be against nature, to be every  where and at all times detested and punished; such as were those of the  men of Sodom: which should all nations commit, they should all stand  guilty of the same crime, by the law of God, which hath not so made men  that they should so abuse one another. For even that intercourse which  should be between God and us is violated, when that same nature, of  which He is Author, is polluted by perversity of lust. But those  actions which are offences against the customs of men, are to be avoided  according to the customs severally prevailing; so that a thing agreed  upon, and confirmed, by custom or law of any city or nation, may not be  violated at the lawless pleasure of any, whether native or foreigner.  For any part which harmoniseth not with its whole, is offensive. But  when God commands a thing to be done, against the customs or compact of  any people, though it were never by them done heretofore, it is to be  done; and if intermitted, it is to be restored; and if never ordained,  is now to be ordained.
