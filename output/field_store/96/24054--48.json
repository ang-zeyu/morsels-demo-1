Here I am. I can do no otherwise.  God help me! Amen.\"    This declaration satisfied his friends, though it did not satisfy the  members of the diet. Luther was permitted to retire. He had gained the  confidence of the nation. From that time, he was its idol, and the  acknowledged leader of the greatest insurrection of human intelligence  which modern times have seen. The great principles of the reformation  were declared. The great hero of the Reformation had planted his cause  upon a rock. And yet his labors had but just commenced. Henceforth,  his life was toil and vexation. New difficulties continually arose.  New questions had to be continually settled. Luther, by his letters,  was every where. He commenced the translation of the Scriptures; he  wrote endless controversial tracts; his correspondence was  unparalleled; his efforts as a preacher were prodigious. But he was  equal to it all; was wonderfully adapted to his age and circumstances.    [Sidenote: Imprisonment at Wartburg.]    About this time commenced his voluntary imprisonment at Wartburg,  among the Thuringian forests: he being probably conducted thither by  the orders of the elector of Saxony. Here he was out of sight, but not  out of mind; and his retirement, under the disguise of a knight, gave  him leisure for literary labor. In the old Castle of Wartburg, a great  part of the Scriptures was translated into that beautiful and simple  version, which is still the standard of the German language.    [Sidenote: Carlstadt.]    While Luther was translating the Scriptures, in his retreat,  Wittemberg was the scene of new commotions, pregnant with great  results. There were many of the more zealous converts to the reformed  doctrines, headed by Carlstadt, dean of the faculty of theology, who  were not content with the progress which had been made, and who  desired more sweeping and radical changes. Such a party ever exists in  all reforms; for there are some persons who are always inclined to  ultra and extravagant courses. Carlstadt was a type of such men. He  was learned, sincere, and amiable, but did not know where to stop; and  the experiment was now to be tried, whether it was possible to  introduce a necessary reform, without annihilating also all the  results of the labors of preceding generations. Carlstadt's mind was  not well balanced, and to him the reformation was only a half measure,  and a useless movement, unless all the external observances of  religion and the whole economy of the church were destroyed. He  abolished, or desired to abolish, all priestly garments, all fasts and  holydays, all pictures in the churches, and all emblematical  ceremonies of every kind. He insisted upon closing all places of  public amusement, the abolition of all religious communities, and the  division of their possessions among the poor. He maintained that there  was no need of learning, or of academic studies, and even went into  the houses of the peasantry to seek explanation of difficult passages  of Scripture. For such innovations, the age was certainly not  prepared, even had they been founded on reason; and the conservative  mind of Luther was shocked at extravagances which served to disgust  the whole Christian world, and jeopardize the cause in which he had  embarked. So, against the entreaties of the elector, and in spite of  the ban of the empire, he returned to Wittemberg, a small city, it was  true, but a place to which had congregated the flower of the German  youth. He resolved to oppose the movements of Carlstadt, even though  opposition should destroy his influence. Especially did he declare  against all violent measures to which the ultra reformers were  inclined, knowing full well, that, if his cause were sullied with  violence or fanaticism, all Christendom would unite to suppress it.  His sermons are, at this time, (1522,) pervaded with a profound and  conservative spirit, and also a spirit of conciliation and love,  calculated to calm passions, and carry conviction to excited minds.  His moderate counsels prevailed, the tumults were hushed, and order  was restored. Carlstadt was silenced for a time; but a mind like his  could not rest, especially on points where he had truth on his side.  One of these was, in reference to the presence of Christ's body in the  Eucharist, which Carlstadt totally denied. He taught \"that the Lord's  supper was purely symbolic, and was simply a pledge to believers of  their redemption.\" But Luther saw, in every attempt to exhibit the  symbolical import of the supper, only the danger of weakening the  authority of Scripture, which was his stronghold, and became  exceedingly tenacious on that point; carried his views to the extreme  of literal interpretation, and never could emancipate himself from the  doctrines of Rome respecting the eucharist. Carlstadt, finding himself  persecuted at Wittemberg left the city, and, as soon as he was  released from the presence of Luther, began to revive his former zeal  against images also, and was the promoter of great disturbances. He at  last sought refuge in Strasburg, and sacrificed fame, and friends, and  bread to his honest convictions.    [Sidenote: Thomas Muenzer.]    But, nevertheless, the views of Carlstadt found advocates, and his  extravagances were copied with still greater zeal. Many pretended to  special divine illumination--the great central principle of all  fanaticism. Among these was Thomas Muenzer, of Zwickau, mystical,  ignorant, and conceited, but sincere and simple hearted. \"Luther,\"  said he, \"has liberated men's consciences from the papal yoke, but has  not led them in spirit towards God.\" Considering himself as called  upon by a special revelation to bring men into greater spiritual  liberty, he went about inflaming the popular mind, and raising  discontents, and even inciting to a revolt. Religion now became  mingled with politics, and social and political evils were violently  resisted, under the garb of religion. An insurrection at last arose in  the districts of the Black Forest, (1524,) near the sources of the  Danube, and spread from Suabia to the Rhine provinces, until it became  exceedingly formidable. Then commenced what is called the \"peasants'  war,\" which was only ended by the slaughter of fifty thousand people.  As the causes of this war, after all, were chiefly political, the  details belong to our chapter on political history. For this  insurrection of the peasantry, however, Luther expressed great  detestation; although he availed himself of it to lecture the princes  of Germany on their duties as civil rulers.    The peasant war was scarcely ended, when Luther married Catharine  Bora; and, as she was a nun, and he was a monk, the marriage gave  universal scandal. But this marriage, which proved happy, was the  signal of new reforms. Luther now emancipated himself from his  monastic fetters, and lifted up his voice against the whole monastic  system. Eight years had elapsed since he preached against indulgences.  During these eight years, reform had been gradual, and had now  advanced to the extreme limit it ever reached during the life of the  reformer.    But, in another quarter, it sprang up with new force, and was carried  to an extent not favored in Germany. It was in Switzerland that the  greatest approximation was made to the forms, if not to the spirit, of  primitive Christianity.    [Sidenote: Ulric Zwingle.]    The great hero of this Swiss movement was Ulric Zwingle, the most  interesting of all the reformers. He was born in 1484, and educated  amid the mountains of his picturesque country, and, like Erasmus,  Reuchlin, Luther, and Melancthon, had no aristocratic claims, except  to the nobility of nature. But, though poor, he was well educated, and  was a master of the scholastic philosophy and of all the learning of  his age. Like Luther, he was passionately fond of music, and played  the lute, the harp, the violin, the flute and the dulcimer. There was  no more joyous spirit in all Switzerland than his. Every one loved his  society, and honored his attainments, and admired his genius. Like  Luther and Erasmus, he was disgusted with scholasticism, and regretted  the time he had devoted to its study. He was ordained in 1506, by the  bishop of Constance, and was settled in Zurich in 1518. At first, his  life did not differ from that which the clergy generally led, being  one of dissipation and pleasure. But he was studious, and became well  acquainted with the fathers, and with the original Greek. Only  gradually did light dawn upon him, and this in consequence of his  study of the Scriptures, not in consequence of Luther's preaching. He  had no tempests to withstand, such as shook the soul of the Saxon  monk. Nor had he ever devoted himself with the same ardor to the  established church. Nor was he so much interested on doctrinal points  of faith. But he saw with equal clearness the corruptions of the  church, and preached with equal zeal against indulgences and the  usurpations of the popes. The reformation of morals was the great aim  of his life. His preaching was practical and simple, and his doctrine  was, that \"religion consisted in trust in God, loving God, and  innocence of life.\" Moreover, he took a deep interest in the political  relations of his country, and was an enthusiast in liberty as well as  in religion. To him the town of Zurich was indebted for its  emancipation from the episcopal government of Constance, and also for  a reformation in all the externals of the church. He inspired the  citizens with that positive spirit of Protestantism, which afterwards  characterized Calvin and the Puritans. He was too radical a reformer  to suit Luther, although he sympathized with most of his theological  opinions.    [Sidenote: Controversy between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1,"perpetuate those ideas in ceremonial and other observances.  The student of Fairy Tales, therefore, cannot afford to neglect the  study of institutions; for it often throws a light altogether  unexpected on the origin and meaning of a story. Tradition must, indeed,  be studied as a whole. As with other sciences, its division into parts  is natural and necessary; but it should never be forgotten that none of  its parts can be rightly understood without reference to the others. By  Tradition I mean the entire circle of thought and practice, custom as  well as belief, ceremonies, tales, music, songs, dances and other  amusements, the philosophy and the superstitions and the institutions,  delivered by word of mouth and by example from generation to generation  through unremembered ages: in a word, the sum total of the psychological  phenomena of uncivilized man. Every people has its own body of  Tradition, its own Folklore, which comprises a slowly diminishing part,  or the whole, of its mental furniture, according as the art of writing  is, or is not, known. The invention of writing, by enabling records to  be made and thoughts and facts to be communicated with certainty from  one to another, first renders possible the accumulation of true  knowledge and ensures a constantly accelerating advance in civilization.  But in every civilized nation there are backward classes to whom reading  and writing are either quite unknown, or at least unfamiliar; and there  are certain matters in the lives even of the lettered classes which  remain more or less under the dominion of Tradition. Culture, in the  sense of a mode of life guided by reason and utilizing the discoveries  and inventions that are the gift of science, finds its way but slowly  among a people, and filters only sluggishly through its habits, its  institutions and its creeds. Surely, however, though gradually it  advances, like a rising tide which creeps along the beach, here  undermining a heap of sand, there surrounding, isolating, and at last  submerging a rock, here swallowing up a pool brilliant with living  creatures and many-coloured weed, there mingling with and overwhelming a  rivulet that leaps down to its embrace, until all the shore is covered  with its waters. Meanwhile, he who would understand its course must know  the conformation of the coast,--the windings, the crags (their  composition as well as their shape), the hollows, the sands, the  streams; for without these its currents and its force are alike  inexplicable. The analogy must not be pressed too far; but it will help  us to understand why we find a fragment of a custom in one place, a  portion of a tale jumbled up with portions of dissimilar tales in  another place, a segment of a superstition, and again a worn and broken  relic of a once vigorous institution. They are the rocks and the sands  which the flood of civilization is first isolating, then undermining,  and at last overwhelming, and hiding from our view. They are (to change  the figure) survivals of an earlier state of existence, unintelligible  if regarded singly, made to render up their secret only by comparison  with other survivals, and with examples of a like state of existence  elsewhere. Taken collectively, they enable us to trace the evolution of  civilization from a period before history begins, and through more  recent times by channels whereof history gives no account.    These are the premises whence we set out, and the principles which will  guide us, in the study on which we are about to enter. The name of Fairy  Tales is legion; but they are made up of incidents whose number is  comparatively limited. And though it would be impossible to deal  adequately with more than a small fraction of them in a work like the  present, still a selection may be so treated as to convey a reasonably  just notion of the application of the principles laid down and of the  results to be obtained. In making such a selection several interesting  groups of stories, unconnected as between themselves, might be chosen  for consideration. The disadvantage of this course would be the  fragmentary nature of the discussions, and consequently of the  conclusions arrived at. It is not wholly possible to avoid this  disadvantage in any mode of treatment; but it is possible to lessen it.  I propose, therefore, to deal with a few of the most interesting sagas  relative to the Fairy Mythology strictly so called. We shall thus  confine our view to a well-defined area, in the hope that we may obtain  such an idea of it as in its main lines at all events may be taken to be  fairly true to the facts, and that we may learn who really were these  mysterious beings who played so large a part in our fathers'  superstitions. As yet, however, we must not be disappointed if we find  that the state of scientific inquiry will not admit of many conclusions,  and such as we may reach can at present be stated only tentatively and  with caution. Science, like Mr. Fox in the nursery tale, writes up over  all the doors of her palace:        \"Be bold, be bold, but not too bold.\"    Many a victim has found to his cost what it meant to disregard this  warning.      FOOTNOTES:    [14] I have not thought it necessary to illustrate at length the  characteristics of savage thought enumerated above. They are  exhaustively discussed by Dr. Tylor in \"Primitive Culture,\" Sir John  Lubbock in \"The Origin of Civilization,\" Mr. Andrew Lang in \"Myth Ritual  and Religion,\" and some of them by Mr. J. G. Frazer in \"Totemism,\" and  more recently in \"The Golden Bough,\" published since these pages were  written.          CHAPTER III.    FAIRY BIRTHS AND HUMAN MIDWIVES.         Stories of midwives who have been summoned to the birth of       fairies--Human visitors to Fairyland must not eat there--The       reason--Fairies' gratitude--The conditions of fairy gifts.      A tale, the scene of which is laid near Beddgelert, runs, as translated  by Professor Rhys, in this way:--\"Once on a time, when a midwife from  Nanhwynan had newly got to the Hafodydd Brithion to pursue her calling,  a gentleman came to the door on a fine grey steed and bade her come with  him at once. Such was the authority with which he spoke, that the poor  midwife durst not refuse to go, however much it was her duty to stay  where she was. So she mounted behind him, and off they went, like the  flight of a swallow, through Cwmllan, over the Bwlch, down Nant yr Aran,  and over the Gadair to Cwm Hafod Ruffydd before the poor woman had time  even to say Oh! When they got there, she saw before her a magnificent  mansion, splendidly lit up with such lamps as she had never before seen.  They entered the court, and a crowd of servants in expensive liveries  came to meet them, and she was at once led through the great hall into a  bed-chamber, the like of which she had never seen. There the mistress of  the house, to whom she had been fetched, was awaiting her. She got  through her duties successfully, and stayed there until the lady had  completely recovered, nor had she spent any part of her life so merrily;  there was naught but festivity day and night: dancing, singing, and  endless rejoicing reigned there. But merry as it was, she found she  must go, and the nobleman gave her a large purse, with the order not to  open it until she had got into her own house; then he bade one of his  servants escort her the same way she had come. When she reached home she  opened the purse, and, to her great joy, it was full of money; and she  lived happily on those earnings to the end of her life.\"[15]    It is a long leap from Carnarvonshire to Lapland, where this story is  told with no great variation. A clergyman's wife in Swedish Lappmark,  the cleverest midwife in all Sweden, was summoned one fine summer's  evening to attend a mysterious being of Troll race and great might,  called Vitra. At this unusual call she took counsel with her husband,  who, however, deemed it best for her to go. Her guide led her into a  splendid building, the rooms whereof were as clean and elegant as those  of very illustrious folk; and in a beautiful bed lay a still more  beautiful woman, for whom her services were required, and who was no  other than Vitra herself. Under the midwife's care Vitra speedily gave  birth to a fair girl, and in a few minutes had entirely recovered, and  fetched all sorts of refreshments, which she laid before her  benefactress. The latter refused to eat, in spite of Vitra's reassuring  persuasion, and further refused the money which the Troll-wife pressed  upon her. Vitra then sent her home, bidding her look on the table when  next she entered her cowherd's hut and see what she would find there.  She thought no more of the matter until the following spring, when on  entering the hut she found on the table half a dozen large spoons of  pure silver with her name engraved thereon in neat letters. These spoons  long remained an heirloom in the clergyman's family to testify the truth  of the story. A Swedish book, published in 1775, contains a tale,  narrated in the form of a legal declaration solemnly subscribed on the  12th April 1671 by the fortunate midwife's husband, whose name was Peter  Rahm, and who also seems to have been a clergyman. On the authority of  this declaration we are called on to believe that the event recorded  actually happened in the year 1660. Peter Rahm alleges that he and his  wife were at their farm one evening late when there came a little man,  swart of face and clad in grey, who begged the declarant's wife to come  and help his wife then in labour. The declarant, seeing that they had to  do with a Troll, prayed over his wife, blessed her, and bade her in  God's name go with the stranger. She seemed to be borne along by the  wind. After her task was accomplished she, like the clergyman's wife  just mentioned, refused the food offered her, and was borne home in the  same manner as she had come."]]]
