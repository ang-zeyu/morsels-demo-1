[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#8)"],[1,"is so wonderful it is almost unbelievable. The public  cannot appreciate what the operation means. There has been some levity  over the news of the gland operations, but it should be treated with the  greatest respect and admiration. The operation has been a success on me  so I am in a position to speak authoritatively. It is one of the  greatest things of the century.\"    Among the other thirty-five patients who have been successfully operated  on are many well-known to thousands of people in Chicago. Here are some  typical Chicago cases omitting names:    Policeman ----, aged 60, suffering from chronic diabetes and a general  breakdown, which was about to compel his retirement from the force.  Operated on August 9. Left the hospital yesterday feeling like \"a new  man.\"    Alderman ----, aged 55, chronic asthma sufferer. Operated on April 26.  Asthma had disappeared by the time he left the hospital. Declared he  felt years younger and is now completely revivified.    Mr. G----, newspaperman, aged 39. Suffered from complete nervous  breakdown from overwork. Operated on April 25. Resumed work almost  immediately, full of pep, and today is the picture of health.    Judge ----, aged 58. Premature old age from hardening of the arteries.  Operated on April 28. Because of his wonderful improvement in health has  changed his mind about retiring from the bench.    +Operation Painless.+ \"Ignorance about the gland transplanting is almost  universal,\" I told Dr. Brinkley. \"I know nothing of it. Tell me how it  is done, why you use goat-glands, all the whys and wherefores, so the  readers of +The American+ will have some authentic information. Is the  operation painful?\"    \"No,\" Dr. Brinkley replied. \"It is a simple incision with very little  actual pain. In practically all cases a local anesthetic is used.  A general anesthetic is used only in exceptional cases.\"    \"How long does the operation take?\"    \"Fifteen to twenty minutes. It is as simple as grafting new shoots on a  fruit tree. No part of the human gland is removed. The goat-gland is  simply planted to take the place of the old gland.\"    \"And the hospital confinement?\"    \"One week, to rest the patient and allow the gland to begin functioning  without undue exertion.\"    \"Any danger?\"    \"None whatever. It's like grafting on a piece of skin. There is  absolutely no danger.\"    +Eliminates Disorders.+ Lost youth is regained, according to Dr.  Brinkley, as a result of the revivifying fluid secreted by the  transplanted gland, leading to the elimination of organic disorders that  are hastening old age.    Dr. Brinkley explained in detail:    \"I began my experiments nine years ago, and began using goat-glands  three years ago in the interstitial gland operation because the  goat-glands resemble to a large degree the human glands in their  histological make-up. The interstitial glands and the blood, of a goat,  are a very close approach in their constituents to those of a human  being.    \"Old people are simply broken down. The goat-gland secretes the fluid  that builds up the brokendown parts of the human body. Eyesight improves  50 per cent. If a man is underweight he will gain to normal, and if he  is overweight he will reduce to normal, showing that the goat glands  actually function.\"    +Chronic Diseases Cured.+ \"Chronic skin diseases are cleared up. Stomach  trouble disappears under the new gland's guardianship of the body.  I have the laboratory data, the scientific records, and the actual  revivified patients to prove it. The only unsuccessful cases are certain  people whose blood lacks necessary essentials, and they are few.\"    Dr. Brinkley gives Dr. G. Frank Lydston of Chicago credit for performing  the first gland transplanting operations.    +Lydston Is Pioneer.+ \"Dr. Lydston is the pioneer,\" Dr. Brinkley said.  \"He was the first man to transplant glands from a human to a human.  I have never transplanted anthropoid ape glands, as Dr. Voronoff of  Paris, and only in three cases human glands, as Dr. Lydston, and I was  not pleased with the results in those three cases. I was the first to  transplant goat glands. Dr. Serge Voronoff has performed the operation  on only two human beings. He failed to give Dr. Lydston credit, although  it is obvious he followed Dr. Lydston's book.\"       *   *   *   *    This completes Mr. Lehrbas' interview. In the same paper, +The Chicago  Evening American+, a month later, date of September 15, appeared the  following account of another visit to Chancellor Tobias, written by  Edward M. Thierry:    J. J. Tobias, chancellor of the Chicago Law School, told me it was none  of my business how old he is. He's got a goat-gland sewed into his  innards and I was trying to get some personal Ponce de Leon statistics.    \"I'm over 50,\" Tobias conceded. \"How much I won't say. But I will say my  clock has been turned back from ten to twenty years! Just look at me!\"    He jumped out of his chair--er--friskily. That's the only expressive  word. Tobias is little, thin and wiry. His face wrinkles up and his  teeth flash when he smiles. He has grey hair and talks with quick  jerks--as if his energy is running a race with his tongue.    \"I'm rejuvenated,\" Tobias said. \"Time will tell whether my goat-gland  will make me live longer. I had that operation on last March 26, and I'm  still living. I'm no decrepit old man, either.\"    Tobias was operated on by Dr. J. R. Brinkley, who has caused a furor in  medical circles through his many successful goat-gland operations.    Critics of Dr. Brinkley make Tobias tired. Get his goat, so to speak. He  says he knows what he's talking about, for he was formerly lecturer in a  Chicago medical college.    \"Seventy-five years ago my father had a little German machine,\" Tobias  said, \"called the 'life waker.' It was a disk as big as a dollar with a  lot of needles in it. You jabbed it into the small of the back and waked  life that way. We can laugh at that archaic system, for it was crude.  Now we're more scientific. Witness the transplantation of goat-glands.\"    Tobias said he went to see Dr. Brinkley at Milford, Kansas, to  investigate his goat-gland discovery because of long suffering from  congestion of the brain arteries. Doctors had told him he was in danger  of death because of severe attacks of vertigo and a high blood pressure.    \"The operation,\" Tobias said, \"occupied about 20 minutes. Within three  hours after the operation the goat-gland began to function, the  congestion was relieved, and within three days the cause was eliminated.    \"I am a new man physically, with new mental vigor, and a new power of  sustained effort. I can distinctly sense the function of a new gland in  my body.\"    It must have functioned muscularly, for when I left Tobias gave me a  knuckle-crushing grip which made it necessary to write this story with  my left hand.      These newspaper articles are printed here without change, in spite of  evident repetitions, because of their evidential value. It is an old  trick of the public press in the United States, and probably in Europe  also, to start a sensation with a blazing front page story, and in the  course of a few weeks follow it with a complete and sarcastic expose of  the whole matter as a baseless fabrication, piling facts on facts to  show that the first story was an ingenious piece of deception got up by  the subject with the purpose of making capital out of the credulity of  the public. There are no better detectives in the world than newspaper  men. They work for the love of it. An expose is dearer to the  detective-instinct in them than a laudatory article, and they leave no  stone unturned to get at the facts. When, therefore, after the lapse of  months, the newspapers of the United States repeat and confirm their  first stories about Dr. Brinkley's work it means something to one who  knows their methods of working. Money cannot buy this sort of publicity.  There must be facts, and facts of value, and facts verified again and  again, before stories of this kind appear and reappear in the great  organs of publicity in all the big cities of the United States. How far  they carry, and how wide-reaching is the interest, will be understood by  the statement that the announcement of Dr. Brinkley's work, printed  first in American newspapers, and copied in the English papers, has  brought him urgent requests to visit South Africa, Australia, Sweden,  Scotland, and many other countries. From England in particular come  requests from women that he do not fail to make a journey to some part  of Europe in the summer of 1921, in order that they may take the  operation with a view to bearing children. This he has arranged to do  about June of this year, expecting to find in England a climate during  the months of June, July and August, which will not be too hot to  prevent him from transplanting the goat-glands. He does not operate at  his hospital in Kansas during June, July and August, on account of the  heat, having found that when the outdoor temperature is high the glands  will certainly slough. The high temperature without seems to create a  high temperature for the patient, and the result is a wasted pair of  good goat glands, with loss of time and money to all concerned. In  England in the summer it should be necessary to wait a few days only for  right climatic conditions to present themselves, and be sure that they  will do so. There are the further matters of a supply of goats of the  right Toggenburg breed, a place to keep them, in close proximity to the  operating hospital, and the hospital itself, to be dealt with suitably  in the shortest possible space of time after arrival. The supply of  goats can probably be best procured direct from Switzerland through some  London importer, and the other matters will no doubt fall easily into  place. The goats must not come from a high altitude, or their glands  will not contain a right amount of iodine."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#8)"],[1,"laterally by some physical characteristic of the soil  structure. The movement of underground water is affected by many  circumstances, but only two conditions need be discussed herein.    Underground water, like surface water, tends to attain a level  surface, but in so doing it may need to flow long distances through  the pores of the soil, and to overcome the resistance incident to so  doing some head will be required. That is to say, the water will be  higher at some places than at others. If a cut is made in grading the  road, the road surface may actually be lower than the ground water  level in the land adjoining the road. As a result, the water will seep  out of the side slopes in the cut and keep the ditches wet, or even  furnish enough water to occasion a flow in the ditch. Similarly, the  higher head of the underground water near the top of a hill may result  in ground water coming quite close to the surface some distance down  the hill. The remedy in both cases is tile underdrains alongside the  road to lower the ground water level so that it cannot affect the road  surface.    Sometimes the ground water encounters an impervious stratum as it  flows downward through the soil, or one that is less pervious than the  surface soil. When such is the case, the water will follow along this  stratum, and should there be an outcrop of the dense stratum, a spring  will be found at that place. This may be on a highway. The impervious  stratum may not actually outcrop but may lie only a few feet under the  surface of the road, in which case, the road surface will be so water  soaked as to be unstable. The so-called \"seepy places\" so often noted  along a road are generally the result of this condition. This  condition can be corrected by tile laid so as to intercept the flow at  a depth that precludes damage to the road. Commonly, the tile will be  laid diagonally across the road some distance above the section where  the effect of the water is noted, and will be turned parallel to the  road at the ditch line and carried under one of the side ditches to an  outlet.    =Tile Drains.=--Where the soil and climatic conditions are such that  the roadway at times becomes unstable because of underground water  rising to a level not far below the road surface, the ground water  level is lowered by means of tile underdrains. The function of the  tile drains in such cases is precisely the same as when employed in  land drainage; to lower the ground water level.    =Laying Tile.=--The tile lines are usually laid in trenches parallel  to the center line of the road near the ditch line and at least 4 feet  deep so as to keep the ground water level well down. They must be  carefully laid to line and grade. A good outlet must be provided and  the last few joints of pipe should be bell-and-spigot sewer pipe with  the joints filled with cement mortar. The opening of the tile should  be covered with a coarse screen to prevent animals from nesting in the  tile.    It is frequently necessary to lay a line of tile at the toe of the  slope in cuts to intercept water that will percolate under the road  from the banks at the sides. In some cases, it is desirable to  back-fill the tile trench with gravel or broken stone to insure rapid  penetration of surface water to the tile. In other instances, it is  advantageous to place catch basins about every three or four hundred  feet. These may be of concrete or of tile placed on end or may be  blind catch basins formed by filling a section of the trench with  broken stone. When a blind catch basin is used, the top should be  built up into a mound, and for a tile or concrete catch basin, a  grating of the beehive type should be used, so that flow to the tile  will not be obstructed by weeds and other trash that is carried to the  catch basin.    =Culverts.=--Culverts and bridges are a part of the drainage system  and the distinction between the two is merely a matter of size.  Generally, structures of spans less than about eight feet are classed  as culverts, but the practice is not uniform. In this discussion  culverts will be defined as of spans of 8 feet or less.    Numerous culverts are required to afford passage for storm water and  small streams crosswise of the road, and their aggregate cost is a  large item in the cost of road improvement. The size of the waterway  of a culvert required in any location will be estimated by an  inspection of the stream and existing structure, and by determining  the extent and physical characteristics of the drainage area.  Sometimes there is sufficient evidence at the site to indicate quite  closely the size required, but this should always be checked by  run-off computations. The drainage area contributing water to the  stream passing through the culvert under consideration is computed  from contour maps or from a survey of the ground, and the size of  culvert determined by one of the empirical formulas applicable to that  purpose. In these formulas, the solution depends upon the proper  selection of a factor \"C\" which varies in accordance with the nature  of the drainage area. Two of these that are quite widely used are as  follows:      _Myers' Formula: a = CA_    Where _a_ = area of cross section of culvert in square feet. _A_ =  area in acres of the drainage area above culvert. _C_ a factor varying  from 1 for flat country to 4 for mountainous country or rocky soil,  the exact value to be selected after an inspection of the drainage  area.    _Talbot's Formula_: Area of waterway in square feet =      _C_ [Square root of] ((Drainage area in acres)^3)         Transcriber's Note: The above formula used the mathematical       square root symbol in the original. One should read it as \"C       times the square root of the Drainage area in acres cubed.\"    _C_ being variable according to circumstances thus:    \"For steep and rocky ground _C_ varies from 2/3 to 1. For rolling  agricultural country, subject to floods at times of melting snow, and  with length of valley three or four times its width, _C_ is about 1/3,  and if stream is longer in proportion to the area, decrease _C_. In  districts not affected by accumulated snow, and where the length of  valley is several times its width, 1/5 or 1/6 or even less may be  used. _C_ should be increased for steep side slopes, especially if the  upper part of the valley has a much greater fall than the channel at  the culvert. The value of _C_ to be used in any case is determined  after an inspection of the drainage area.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Design of Pipe Culvert and Bulkhead]    =Length of Culvert.=--The clear length between end walls on a culvert  should be at least equal to the width of the roadway between ditches.  This is a minimum of 20 feet for secondary roads and ranges from 24 to  30 feet for main roads. The headwall to the culvert should not be a  monument, but should be no higher than needed to prevent vehicles from  leaving the roadway at the culvert.    =Farm Entrance Culverts.=--At farm entrances, culverts are required to  carry the farm driveway across the side ditch of the road. These  culverts are usually about 16 feet along, and should be of a size  adequate to take the flow of the side ditch. The farm entrance culvert  should be of such design that it can be easily removed to permit  cleaning out the ditches with a road grader.      TYPES OF CULVERTS    Culverts constructed of concrete and poured in place are called box  culverts because of the rectangular form of the cross section.  Culverts of pre-cast pipe are known as pipe culverts. Several forms of  pipe culvert are in general use.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Typical Concrete Box Culvert]    =Metal Pipe.=--These may be of cast iron, steel or wrought iron. The  cast iron pipe is very durable but expensive and heavy to handle and  is not widely used in highway construction. Steel pipe has been  employed to a limited extent but its durability is questioned. At  least it is known that the pipe made from uncoated, light sheet steel  is not very durable. Sheet iron and sheets made from alloy iron  coated with spelter have been extensively used and seem to be durable,  especially when laid deep enough to eliminate possibility of damage  from heavy loads. To insure reasonable resistance to corrosion, the  metal sheets should be coated with at least one and one-half ounces of  spelter per square foot of sheet and the sheets should not be lighter  than 16 gauge for small sizes and should be heavier for the larger  sizes.    =Clay and Cement Concrete Pipe.=--The ordinary burned clay bell and  spigot pipe that is employed for sewer construction is sometimes used  for culverts. It must be very carefully bedded, preferably on a  concrete cradle and the joints filled with cement mortar. Culverts of  this type have a tendency to break under unusual loads, such as  traction engines or trucks. They may be damaged by the pressure from  freezing water, particularly when successive freezing and thawing  results in the culvert filling with mushy snow, which subsequently  freezes.    =Concrete Pipe.=--Reinforced concrete pipe is a satisfactory material  for culverts, if the pipe is properly designed. The pipe should be  carefully laid on a firm earth bed with earth carefully back-filled  and tamped around the pipe. The joints in the pipe should be filled  with cement mortar, or should be of a design that will be tight.    =Endwalls for Culverts.=--A substantial retaining wall is placed at  each end of the culvert barrel, whatever the type. This is to prevent  the end of the culvert from becoming choked with earth and to retain  the roadway at the culvert. It also indicates to the drivers the  location of the end of the culvert. The endwall extends a foot or more  below the floor of the culvert to prevent water from cutting under the  barrel. Plain concrete or stone masonry are most commonly used for  culvert endwalls.
