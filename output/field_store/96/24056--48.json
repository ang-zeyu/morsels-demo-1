[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24637"],[0,"Bromide Printing and Enlarging (#8)"],[1,"th, when the ferricyanide can be applied as before.    Latterly the toning of bromide prints has become popular. There are many  methods and innumerable formulae. Here we shall concern ourselves with the  sulphide method which best fulfills the three chief requirements, namely:  (1) Certainty of results; (2) the use of few baths; (3) the production of  permanent prints. Processes which, as regards color, vigor, etc., are  beyond the control of the worker, are of very little practical use.  Equally so, if the toning involves a whole string of operations, the final  outcome of which is usually--a spoilt print. And, lastly, a process  which--however satisfactory it may be in other respects--impairs the  undoubted permanency of a black-developed print is not one worthy of  adoption. In one or two other respects, processes vary chiefly as regards  the depth or intensity which the print must have in order to produce the  most satisfactory result when toned. Thus, prints to be toned with uranium  require to be distinctly on the pale side, whilst those for sulphide  toning are best a little vigorous. One or two other methods, on the other  hand, require the use of the costly gold or platinum salts. The latter,  except under exceptional circumstances, are far better employed in the  legitimate form of platinotype or other platinum paper; bromide prints  toned with platinum will probably cost more, and will never have the  absolute permanence peculiar to the platinum print.    Placed in rough order of merit, the processes available are: Sulphide  toning (hypo-alum toning is a cheaper, slower, and not quite so effective  form of this method, whilst the thio processes represent sulphide toning  at its best); copper toning; toning by re-development. These methods  differ, not only in the results which they give, but also as regards the  perfection with which each attains its particular effect; on the principle  of the lady in the play who spoke the \"absolute truth under the  circumstances,\" each may claim to be included among the really serviceable  processes.    In the sulphide process, the image which, in a black-developed print,  consists of metallic silver in fine division, is converted into silver  sulphide, a substance which in the ordinary way is also black, but when  produced in a fine condition on a photographic print is brown to sepia  color. Silver sulphide is a most permanent substance. Therefore a  sulphide-toned print should be permanent, too, a conclusion which is fully  borne out in practice. A sulphide-toned print is at least as permanent as  the bromide from which it is made. The image of the latter is susceptible  to practically only one agent likely to come in contact with it, namely,  sulphur fumes from burning gas, which partially sulphurize it and give  rise to iridescent markings resembling those due to stale paper. Now, as  the sulphide-toned print is the result of this sulphurizing process  carried out with intention to a state of completeness, the result should  be--and proves to be in practice--immune to this one cause of defacement.    In converting the silver image into one of silver sulphide, the method is  to first act on (bleach) the silver image with some reagent which will  change it into a compound of silver susceptible to the action of sulphide.  Iodine has been used for this, giving an image of silver iodide. Bromine  gives one of silver bromide. A mixture of potass bichromate and  hydrochloric acid gives silver chloride, as does also a solution of  chlorine, though in the former case the presence of the chromium compounds  affects the color obtained. But the best of the lot is a solution of the  two substances potassium ferricyanide and potassium bromide, which forms  an image of silver ferrocyanide and silver bromide. Both of these are  converted into silver sulphide when treated with a solution of sodium  sulphide. In the case of the hypo-alum process, in which the prints are  toned direct (without bleaching) in a mixture of hypo and alum, the image  is also changed into silver sulphide, but only to a partial extent.  Theoretically, the method is not so good as sulphide proper; it is much  more inconvenient in practice except on a commercial scale, while the  results cannot be said to quite equal those by the sulphide process as  regards permanency.    So much by way of theory. We will now give the formulae for the two  solutions required in the sulphide process. The first of these is the  \"bleach,\" or oxidizing mixture of bromide and ferricyanide. Within  reasonable limits, the proportions of these salts and the quantity of each  in the solution does not matter very much. Each chemical can, if desired,  be kept in a separate solution if care be taken to keep the mixture in the  dark,--that is, in a cupboard where it will not be exposed constantly to  daylight. The ferricyanide suffers in time by exposure to daylight; but,  as both it and the bromide are comparatively cheap and serve for a large  number of prints, there is no need to take excessive care. The  ferricyanide-bromide mixture, however, keeps very much better than a plain  solution of ferricyanide alone. Formulae which place the salts in separate  solutions are a mistake.    As good a formula as any is: Potass ferricyanide, 300 grains; potass  bromide, 100 grains, water 20 ounces; Ammonium bromide may be used in  place of the potassium salt in the above formula; the difference is not  marked, but the ammonium compound tends to give a somewhat warmer brown or  sepia. In the case of many formulae, it will be noticed that equal  quantities of bromide and ferricyanide are recommended. Although, as just  stated, variations in the formula are not at all marked in their effects,  a proportion of bromide over one-quarter of the ferricyanide does tend  towards the yellowish color of which complaints are now and again heard. I  want to make it clear that the opportunities for going wrong with the  bleacher are very small indeed. Without encouraging the reader to be  careless let it be said that \"any old formula\" (of ferricyanide and  bromide) for the bleacher will prove successful. Not so, however, in the  case of the sulphide solution, which requires to be very carefully made up  and used.    Sulph_ide_, not sulph_ite_. The material for the toning or darkening of  the bleached print is the chemical substance, sodium sulphide, of the  formula Na_2S.9H_2O. This is purchased as small crystals which greedily  absorb water and rapidly become almost liquid if not properly corked. Not  that this totally unfits the sulphide for use. Sulphide which has gone  liquid will at all times be found to work perfectly, but it is of course  open to suspicion, and, in any case, it is not possible to know what is  the strength of a solution made up with such a supply. For this reason, it  is best to make up the sulphide into solution of 20 per cent strength, and  add this to water to make the toning bath. And it is here that a caution  must be noted. The weak working solution, which is only about 1 to 2 per  cent strength, keeps very badly indeed, and should be made up fresh from  the stock solution at the time of toning each batch of prints. This is one  of the most necessary items to bear in mind in using the sulphide process.    Sodium sulphide is sold in various degrees of purity, and the label on the  bottle is not always in exact correspondence with the condition of the  substance inside, but the two forms which must be adhered to for sulphide  toning are the ordinary \"pure\" and the \"pure for analysis.\" The former can  be obtained from any reliable drug store or photographic dealer. It comes  in small lumps, yellowish to greenish in color; when dissolved in water  the solution will be yellow, and will usually show a deposit which must be  filtered off. This sulphide will give tones which are sepia brown with  most papers. In the case of the \"pure-for-analysis\" sulphide, which is the  recrystallized variety, the salt will be pure white and will form a quite  colorless and clear solution in water. The tone given by this kind of  sulphide is usually of a more purplish color. The distinct difference  between the two commercial varieties of sulphide should not be overlooked,  as it allows the worker to modify the process usefully when dealing with  papers differing (as all papers do) to a slight extent in their  adaptability to sulphide toning. The purer form has certainly much better  keeping properties than the other, but either, if made up in 20 per cent  solution, keeps for a month or two at least--which is enough for all  purposes. The chief difference between the two is noticed in the diluted  or working solutions. That of the purest sulphide _may_ be kept and used  again, though it is not really good policy to do so.    The supply of sulphide should therefore be dissolved as soon as purchased,  as follows: _Stock sulphide solution_--20 per cent; sodium sulphite 4  ounces; water to make 20 ounces. The actual toning solution is made up at  the time of treating the prints by mixing the above stock with water, as  follows: _Sulphide toning bath._--Stock 20 per cent solution 3 ounces;  water to make 20 ounces.    This makes a bath which contains about one per cent real sulphide,  corresponding with about a 3 per cent solution of the sulphide as  purchased. If the bath is much weaker, the tone obtained is usually not  quite so good; while, if it is stronger, there is danger of the print's  blistering while toning, or afterward in the washing water. Indeed, some  papers need to be toned in a weaker bath, and require also to be fixed in  an alum-hypo fixing bath (see later), so that the strength of the toning  bath given above may be taken as the maximum, and used at half or  one-third strength, as circumstances show to be necessary. And, to repeat  the caution once more, the toning bath is to be thrown away as soon as the  prints have been passed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24647"],[0,"The Standard Operaglass (#8)"],[1," at once; even Fieramosca at the Cardinal's request  assists.

BY ORDER OF HIS HIGHNESS    (AUF HOHEN BEFEHL.)    Comic Opera in three acts by CARL REINECKE.    Text by the composer after RIEHL's novel: \"Ovidius at Court.\"      Reinecke of Leipzig is known both as excellent pianist and composer of  no ordinary talent.  The Dresden theatre has been one of the first to  put the new opera upon its boards and with regard to the music, the  expectations entertained have been fully realised.    It is true music, melodious and beautiful.  Reinecke's musical language  free, untrammelled and suggestive, only assumes decided form in the  character of a song, or when several voices are united.  The  instrumentation is very interesting and the popular melody remarkably  well characterized.    So he introduces for instance the wellknown popular song: \"Kein Feuer,  keine Kohle\" (no fire, no coal can burn) with the most exquisite  variations.    The libretto is not as perfect as the music, being rather improbable.    A little German Residential Capital of the last century forms the  background to the picture.    {31}    Franz, the son of the Organist Ignaz Laemml, introduces himself to Dal  Segno, the celebrated Italian singing-master as the Bohemian singer  Howora.  He obtains lessons from the capricious old man, who however  fails to recognize in him the long-absent son of his old enemy.  Cornelia, Dal Segno's daughter however is not so slow in recognizing  the friend of her childhood, who loves her and has all her love, as we  presently learn.  Franz has only taken the name of Howora, in order to  get into favor with the maiden's father, an endeavour in which he  easily succeeds owing to his musical talents.    Meanwhile the Prince is determined to have an opera composed from  Ovid's metamorphoses.  He has chosen Pyramus and Thisbe, but as the  Princess is of a very gay disposition, a request is made that the  tragedy have a happy solution, a whim which puts old pedantic Laemml  quite out of sorts.    In the second act Louis, one of the princely lackeys, brings a large  cracknel and huge paper-cornet of sweets for Cornelia, whom he courts  and whose favor he hopes in this way to win.    When he is gone, Dal Segno's sister Julia, lady's maid to the Princess,  enters with birthday-presents for her niece Cornelia, and among the  things which attract her attentions sees the cracknel, beside which she  finds a note from her own faithless lover Louis.  Filled with righteous  indignation she takes it away.    Cornelia stepping out to admire her {32} birthday-presents, meets  Franz, and after a tender scene, the young man tells his lady-love,  that he has been fortunate enough to invent for his father a happy  issue to the tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, and that they may now hope  the best from the grateful old master.    Meanwhile good old Laemml himself appears to ask his old enemy Dal  Segno to give singing-lessons to his dear son.  The Italian teacher is  very rude and ungracious, Laemml's blood rises also and a fierce  quarrel ensues, which is interrupted by the arrival of the Prince.  Having heard their complaints, he decides that the quarrel is to be  settled by a singing competition in which Howora, Dal Segno's new and  greatly praised pupil, and Franz, Laemml's son, are to contest for the  laurels.  Both masters are content and decide on a duet for tenor and  soprano.  This is a happy choice and Franz, who with Cornelia has heard  everything, causes his lady-love to disguise herself, in order to play  the part of Franz, while he decides to appear as Howora.    In the third act the Princess receives old Laemml, who comes to tell  her, that he has complied with her wishes as to the happy issue of the  tale and confides to her his son's secret, that Franz and Howora are  one and the same person.--The gracious Princess promises her  assistance, and Laemml leaves her very happy, dancing and merry-making  with the Prince's fool.--    In the evening Louis finds Julia attired in {33} Cornelia's dress, and  believing her to be her niece, he places a ring on her finger and once  more pledges his faith to his old love.    The two singers perform their duet so perfectly, that Laemml, uncertain  who will obtain the prize begs for a solo.  Each-one then sings a  popular song (Volkslied), and all agree that Howora has triumphed.  The  happy victor is crowned with the laurels.  But the Princess, touched by  the sweet voice of the other singer puts a rose-wreath on his brow.  When the cap is taken off, Dal Segno perceives that the pretended Franz  has the curls of his own daughter.--Howora being presented to him as  Laemml's son, he can do no other than yield.  He embraces old Laemml  and gives his benediction to the lovers.          CARLO BROSCHI    or    THE DEVIL'S PART.    Comic Opera in three acts by AUBER.    Text by SCRIBE.      This composition might rather be called a Vaudeville with musical  accompaniment, than an opera.  The music is not above mediocrity,  though we find many pleasing and even exquisite melodies in it.  That  it has held its present place on the stage for the past forty years is  due principally to its excellent libretto, which is full of comical and  ingenious situations.  The principal role is given to Carlo Broschi.  He is no other than the famous {34} singer Farinelli, who as a matter  of fact did heal a Spanish King from madness, though it was not  Ferdinand IV, but his predecessor Philip V, the husband of Elizabeth of  Ferrara.  Notwithstanding these anachronisms the libretto ranks with  the best.    Carlo Broschi has placed his only sister Casilda in a convent near  Madrid, to save her from the persecutions of the clergy, who have been  trying for reasons of their own to give the beautiful maiden to the  King.  Casilda confesses to her brother that she is in love with an  unknown cavalier, who entertains a like passion for her, but Carlo, a  poor minstrel, considers that his sister, a milliner, does not stand  high enough in the social scale to permit a lawful union with a  nobleman.    Carlo meets the King accidentally.  He has fallen into deep melancholy,  and Carlo succeeds in cheering him by singing an old romance, which he  learnt from his mother.  Both King and Queen are full of gratitude, and  Carlo soon finds himself at court and loaded with honors.  In his new  position he meets with Raphael d'Estuniga, Casilda's lover.    In despair at having lost his lady-love he is about to appeal to the  Devil for help, when Carlo appears, presenting himself as Satan.  He  promises his help on condition that Raphael shall give him one half of  all his winnings.  This is a condition easily accepted, and Raphael is  made a Court Official through Carlo's influence.    Meanwhile the clergy vainly try to ensnare the King again; Carlo is  like his better self; he {35} disperses his Sire's melancholy by  singing to him and rekindles his interest in government.    Raphael, feeling quite secure in his league with the Devil, begins to  play; he is fortunate, but Carlo never fails to claim the share, which  is willingly surrendered to him.    All at once Casilda appears on the scene to put herself under the  protection of her brother, the priests having found out her refuge.  She recognizes the King, and tells her brother that it was he, to whom  she was taken against her will.  The King believes her to be a ghost  and his reason threatens to give way, but Carlo assures him that the  girl is living.  The Queen, who knows nothing of her husband's secret,  here interrupts the conversation and bids Carlo follow her.    Meanwhile Raphael and Casilda have an interview, but the King comes  suddenly upon them and at once orders Raphael to be put to death, the  latter having failed in the reverence due to his Sovereign.  Raphael  however trusting in the Devil's help does not let his spirits sink and  Carlo actually saves him by telling the King, that Casilda is Raphael's  wife.    But the Grand-Inquisitor succeeds in discovering this untruth, and in  exciting the King's anger against his favorite.  Carlo, much  embarrassed, obtains an interview with the King, and confessing the  whole truth assures him, that the Queen knows as yet nothing and  implores him to give his thoughts and his affections once more to her  and to his country.  {36} The King, touched to generosity, gives his  benediction to the lovers, together with a new title for Raphael, who  is henceforth to be called Count of Puycerda.  Now at last Raphael  learns that the so-called Devil is his bride's brother, who tells him  that this time his share lies in making two lovers happy, a share which  gives him both pleasure and content.          CARMEN.    Opera in four acts by GEORGE BIZET.      This opera is essentially Spanish.  The music throughout has a southern  character and is passionate and original to a high degree.    Carmen, the heroine is a Spanish gipsy, fickle and wayward, but endowed  with all the wild graces of her nation.  She is adored by her people,  and so it is not to be wondered at, that she has many of the stronger  sex at her feet.  She is betrothed to Don Jose, a brigadier of the  Spanish army; of course he is one out of many; she soon grows tired of  him, and awakens his jealousy by a thousand caprices and cruelties.    Don Jose has another bride, sweet and lovely, Micaela, waiting for him  at home, but she is forgotten as soon as he sees"]]]
