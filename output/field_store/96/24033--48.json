She had entered in a reckless mood, almost anxious to be scolded,  that she might have the chance of showing how little she cared; and  now, for perhaps the first time in her life, she had been compelled to  think seriously and sensibly upon a subject.    Very few teachers would have taken the trouble to reason thus with a  pupil, but Miss Cavendish had her special method of education, and  believed in paying particular attention to each girl's individuality.  \"Different plants require different cultivation, if you are to obtain  good results,\" was one of her axioms. \"You cannot successfully grow  roses and carnations with the same treatment.\" She had seen at once,  partly from her own observation and partly as the result of a talk with  Major Fitzgerald, that Honor was an unusual and difficult character;  and she wished to obtain a hold over the girl's mind from the very  outset. It was part of her system to train her pupils to keep rules  rather from a recognition of their justice and value than from a fear  of punishment; therefore she regarded the ten minutes spent in the  study as, not wasted time, but an opportunity of sowing good seed on  hitherto neglected ground.    Vivian Holmes was waiting for Honor outside the door of the study.  After conducting her to the school dressing-room, she produced a pair  of scissors and ripped the offending green trimming from the hat in  stony silence.    \"May I keep them?\" Honor ventured to ask, for it went to her heart to  see her bunch of cherished shamrock torn ruthlessly from its place and  flung aside.    \"As you like,\" replied Vivian, \"so long as they are not seen here  again.\" Then, with a look of utterly crushing scorn, she burst out:  \"You needn't think that what you have done is at all clever. It's not  the place of a new girl to show off in this way, and you'll gain  nothing by it. I am responsible for St. Chad's, and I don't mean to  have this kind of nonsense going on there; so please understand, Honor  Fitzgerald, that if you give any more trouble, you may expect to find  yourself thoroughly well sat upon!\"          CHAPTER IV    Janie's Charge      The four-leaved shamrock having so far belied its reputation, and  brought bad luck instead of good upon its wearer, Honor put it away in  her drawer, with the resolve not to test its powers again until she was  back in her own Emerald Isle, where, perhaps, it could exercise its  magic more freely than in the land of the stranger.    Her first day at school was satisfactory, in spite of its bad  beginning. She took her place in her new class, and made the  acquaintance of Miss Farrar, her Form mistress, and all the seventeen  girls who composed the Lower Third Form.    After the quiet and solitude of Kilmore Castle, to be at Chessington  College seemed like plunging into the world. It was almost bewildering  to meet so many companions, all of whom were busily occupied with  employments into which she had not yet been initiated. It was an  especially fresh experience for Honor to belong to a class, instead of  learning from a private governess, and she much appreciated the change.  It interested her to watch the faces of her schoolfellows, and to  listen to their recitations, or their replies to Miss Farrar's  questions. The strict discipline of the place astonished her: the ready  answers, the total lack of whispering, the way in which each girl sat  straight at her desk, giving her whole attention to the subject in  hand; the prompt obedience, even the orderly manner of filing out of  the room for lunch, all were as unusual as they were amazing to one who  had hitherto behaved as she liked during lessons. She felt for the  first time that she was a unit in a large community, and began to have  some dim perception of that esprit de corps to which Miss Cavendish had  referred during their interview in the study.    In spite of her previous laziness and neglect of work, Honor was a very  bright girl, and she contrived even in that first morning to satisfy  Miss Farrar that she was capable of doing well if she wished. Perhaps,  after all, the four-leaved shamrock had sent her a little luck, for she  happened to remember a date which the rest of the Form had forgotten,  and won corresponding credit in consequence. When one o'clock arrived  she arranged her new textbooks and notebooks in the desk that had been  allotted to her next to Lettice Talbot.    \"Did you get into a fearful scrape with Miss Cavendish, Paddy?\"  whispered the latter eagerly. \"Do tell me about it!\"    But Honor pursed up her mouth and looked inscrutable. She was unwilling  to divulge what had passed in the study, and Lettice's curiosity had  perforce to go unsatisfied.    On her arrival at St. Chad's Honor had been given a spare cubicle in  the bedroom occupied by the Talbots and Pauline Reynolds. On the  following afternoon, however, Miss Maitland sent for Janie Henderson, a  girl of nearly sixteen, and informed her that a fresh arrangement had  been made.    \"I am going to put you and Honor Fitzgerald together in the room over  the porch,\" she said. \"I hope that you will get on nicely, and become  friends. I want you, Janie, to have a good influence over Honor, and  help her to keep school rules. She does not yet know our St. Chad's  standards, and has very much to learn. I give her into your charge  because I am sure you are conscientious, and will try your best to make  her wish to improve and turn out a worthy Chaddite. You may carry your  things into your new quarters during recreation-time.\"    \"Yes, Miss Maitland,\" answered Janie, with due respect. She dared not  dispute the mistress's orders, but inwardly she was anything but  pleased. She did not wish to leave her present cubicle, and looked with  dismay at the prospect of having to share a bedroom with this wild  Irish girl, towards whom as yet she certainly felt no attraction.    Janie Henderson had a painfully shy and reserved disposition. Hitherto  she had made no friends, invited no confidences, and \"kept herself to  herself\" at St. Chad's. She was seldom seen walking with a companion,  and during recreation generally buried herself in a book. Slight, pale,  and narrow-chested, her constitution was not robust; and though a year  and a half at Chessington College had already worked a wonderful  improvement, she was still far below the ordinary average of good  health. She was a quiet, mouse-like girl, who seldom obtruded herself,  or took any prominent part in the life of St. Chad's--a girl who was  continually in the background, and passed almost unnoticed among her  schoolfellows. She had little self-confidence and a sensitive dread of  being laughed at, so for this reason she rarely offered a suggestion,  or an opinion, unless invited. She often felt lonely at school, but her  shyness prevented her from making advances, and so far nobody had  offered her even the elements of friendship. It sometimes hurt her to  be thus entirely ignored and left out, but she had grown accustomed to  it, and, shutting herself up in her shell, she followed the motto of  the Miller of Dee:        \"I care for nobody, no, not I,      Since nobody cares for me.\"    She was obliged to share in the daily games, which were compulsory for  all; but she never joined in the voluntary ones unless she were  specially asked to do so, to make up a side, and then she played with  an utter lack of enthusiasm. \"Moonie\", as the girls called her, was a  bookworm pure and simple. She had read almost every volume in the  school library; it did not matter whether it were biography, travels,  poetry, essays, or fiction, she would devour any literature that came  her way. She lived in an imaginary world, peopled by heroes and  heroines of romance, who often seemed more real to her than her  schoolmates, and certainly twice as interesting. Half the time she went  about in a dream, and even during lesson hours she would let her  thoughts drift far away to some exciting incident in a story, or some  mental picture of her own. It appeared as if Miss Maitland could not  have picked out two more opposite and unsuitable girls to share a  bedroom than Honor Fitzgerald and Janie Henderson; but she had good  reasons for her choice. Not only did she hope that Janie's sober ways  would steady Honor, but she also thought that Honor's high spirits  would have a leavening effect upon Janie, who was sadly in need of  stirring up.    \"I wish I could shake the pair in a bag!\" she confided to a  fellow-teacher. \"It would be of the greatest advantage to both.\"    There was at least one compensation to Janie for being obliged to  change her quarters. No. 8, the room over the porch, was a special  sanctum, much coveted by all the other Chaddites. It was arranged to  accommodate only two, instead of four, and was the beau-ideal of every  pair of chums. It had a French window opening out on to a tiny balcony,  and, having been originally intended for one of the mistresses, was  furnished rather more luxuriously than the rest of the bedrooms. There  was a handsome wall-paper, a full-length mirror in the wardrobe, a  comfortable basket-chair, and also what appealed particularly to  Janie--a large and inviting bookcase, with glass doors. She conducted  her removal, therefore, with less dissatisfaction than she had at first  anticipated.    \"I call you lucky,\" declared Lettice Talbot. \"I only wish I could go  instead. Everyone on our landing is envying you. I shall be rather  sorry to lose Paddy--I think she's a joke.\"    \"Especially as we're to have Flossie Taylor instead,\" said Pauline  Reynolds. \"It's a poor exchange. I can't stand Flossie; she gives  herself airs.\"    \"She needn't put them on with us,\" observed Maisie. \"I've had a quarrel  with her already. She was actually trying to make Lettice pick up her  balls for her at tennis!\"    \"Lettice always picks up yours,\" suggested Pauline.    \"That's a totally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#8)"],[1,"severance with the mother country. A resolution  to that effect was carried on the motion of Lee, the great Virginian  gentleman, an ancestor of the noblest of Southern warriors. After much  adroit negotiations a unanimous vote was secured for it. A committee was  appointed to draft a formal announcement and defence of the step which  had been taken. Jefferson was chosen a member of the committee, and to  him was most wisely entrusted the drafting of the famous \"Declaration.\"    The introductory paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence contain  the whole substance of the faith upon which the new Commonwealth was to  be built. Without a full comprehension of their contents the subsequent  history of America would be unintelligible. It will therefore be well to  quote them here verbatim, and I do so the more readily because, apart  from their historic importance, it is a pity that more Englishmen are  not acquainted with this masterpiece of English prose.    _When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people  to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another  and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal  station to which the laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a  decent respect for the opinion of Mankind requires that they shall  declare the cause that impels the separation.    We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal;  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;  that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that  to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving  their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any  form of government becomes destructive of those ends it is the right of  the people to alter or to abolish it, and to reinstate a new government,  laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in  such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and  happiness._    The Declaration goes on to specify the causes of grievances which the  colonists conceive themselves to have against the royal government, and  concludes as follows:--    _We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America in  General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World  for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name and by the authority  of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that  these United Colonies are and of right ought to be Free and Independent  States._    The first principles set out in the Declaration must be rightly grasped  if American history is understood, for indeed the story of America is  merely the story of the working out of those principles. Briefly the  theses are two: first, that men are of right equal, and secondly, that  the moral basis of the relations between governors and governed is  contractual. Both doctrines have in this age had to stand the fire of  criticisms almost too puerile to be noticed. It is gravely pointed out  that men are of different heights and weights, that they vary in  muscular power and mental cultivation--as if either Rousseau or  Jefferson was likely to have failed to notice this occult fact!  Similarly the doctrine of the contractual basis of society is met by a  demand for the production of a signed, sealed, and delivered contract,  or at least for evidence that such a contract was ever made. But  Rousseau says--with a good sense and modesty which dealers in  \"prehistoric\" history would do well to copy--that he does not know how  government in fact arose. Nor does anyone else. What he maintains is  that the moral sanction of government is contractual, or, as Jefferson  puts it, that government \"derives its just powers from the consent of  the governed.\"    The doctrine of human equality is in a sense mystical. It is not  apparent to the senses, nor can it be logically demonstrated as an  inference from anything of which the senses can take cognizance. It can  only be stated accurately, and left to make its appeal to men's minds.  It may be stated theologically by saying, as the Christian theology  says, that all men are equal before God. Or it may be stated in the form  which Jefferson uses--that all men are equal in their \"inalienable  rights.\" But it must be accepted as a first principle or not at all. The  nearest approach to a method of proving it is to take the alternative  proposition and deduce its logical conclusion. Would those who would  maintain that the \"wisest and best\" have rights superior to those of  their neighbours, welcome a law which would enable any person  demonstrably wiser or more virtuous than themselves to put them to  death? I think that most of them have enough modesty (and humour) to  shrink, as Huxley did, from such a proposition. But the alternative is  the acceptance of Jefferson's doctrine that the fundamental rights of  men are independent of adventitious differences, whether material or  moral, and depend simply upon their manhood.    The other proposition, the contractual basis of human society and its  logical consequences, the supremacy of the general will, can be argued  in the same fashion. It is best defended by asking, like the Jesuit  Suarez, the simple question: \"If sovereignty is not in the People, where  is it?\" It is useless to answer that it is in the \"wisest and best.\" Who  are the wisest and best? For practical purposes the phrases must mean  either those whom their neighbours think wisest and best--in which case  the ultimate test of democracy is conceded--or those who think  themselves wisest and best: which latter is what in the mouths of such  advocates it usually does mean. Thus those to whom the Divine Right of  the conceited makes no appeal are forced back on the Jeffersonian  formula. Let it be noted that that formula does not mean that the people  are always right or that a people cannot collectively do deliberate  injustice or commit sins--indeed, inferentially it implies that  possibility--but it means that there is on earth no temporal authority  superior to the general will of a community.    It is, however, no part of the function of this book to argue upon the  propositions contained in the Declaration of Independence. It is merely  necessary to chronicle the historical fact that Jefferson, as mouthpiece  of the Continental Congress, put forward these propositions as  self-evident, and that all America, looking at them, accepted them as  such. On that acceptance, the intensity and ardent conviction of which  showed itself, as will presently be seen, in a hundred ways, the  American Commonwealth is built. In the modern haze of doubt and amid the  denial of all necessary things, there have been found plenty of  sophists, even in America, to dispute these great truisms. But if the  American nation as a whole ever ceases to believe in them, it will not  merely decay, as all nations decay when they lose touch with eternal  truths; it will drop suddenly dead.    We must now turn back a little in time in order to make clear the  military situation as it stood when Jefferson's \"Declaration\" turned the  war into a war of doctrines.    The summer of 1775 saw the first engagement which could well be  dignified with the name of a battle. A small English force had been sent  to Boston with the object of coercing the recalcitrant colony of  Massachusetts. It was absolutely insufficient, as the event showed, even  for that purpose, and before it had landed it was apparent that its real  task would be nothing less than the conquest of America. The  Massachusetts rebels wisely determined to avoid a combat with the guns  of the British fleet; they abandoned the city and entrenched themselves  in a strong position in the neighbourhood known as Bunker's Hill. The  British troops marched out of Boston to dislodge them. This they  eventually succeeded in doing; and those who regard war as a game like  billiards to be settled by scoring points may claim Bunker's Hill as a  British victory. But it produced all the consequences of a defeat. The  rebel army was not destroyed; it was even less weakened than the force  opposed to it. It retired in good order to a position somewhat further  back, and the British force had no option but to return to Boston with  its essential work undone. For some time England continued to hold  Boston, but the State of Massachusetts remained in American hands. At  last, in the absence of any hope of any effective action, the small  English garrison withdrew, leaving the original prize of war to the  rebels.    On the eve of this indecisive contest the American Congress met to  consider the selection of a commander-in-chief for the revolutionary  armies. Their choice fell on General George Washington, a Virginian  soldier who, as has been remarked, had served with some distinction in  the French wars.    The choice was a most fortunate one. America and England have agreed to  praise Washington's character so highly that at the hands of the young  and irreverent he is in some danger of the fate of Aristides. For the  benefit of those who tend to weary of the Cherry Tree and the Little  Hatchet, it may be well to say that Washington was a very typical  Southern gentleman in his foibles as well as in his virtues. Though his  temper was in large matters under strict control, it was occasionally  formidable and vented itself in a free and cheerful profanity. He loved  good wine, and like most eighteenth-century gentlemen, was not sparing  in its use. He had a Southerner's admiration for the other sex--an  admiration which, if gossip may be credited, was not always strictly  confined within monogamic limits. He had also, in large measure, the  high dignity and courtesy of his class, and an enlarged liberality of  temper which usually goes with such good breeding. There is no story of  him more really"]]]
