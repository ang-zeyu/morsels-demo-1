All which, though  plausible in tone labours under the disadvantage of being untrue.    Ptolemy is careful to point out, in his celebrated work the  'Tetrabiblos,' that, of all events whatsoever which take place after  birth, the most essential is the continuance of life. 'It is useless,'  he says, 'to consider what events might happen to the native in later  years if his life does not extend, for instance, beyond one year. So  that the enquiry into the duration of life takes precedence of all  others.' In order to deal properly with this question, it is necessary  to determine what planet shall be regarded as the Hyleg, Apheta, or Lord  of Life, for the native. Next the Anareta, or Destroyer of Life, must be  ascertained. The Anaretic planets are, by nature, Saturn, Mars, and  Uranus, though the sun, moon, and Mercury may be endowed with the same  fatal influence, if suitably afflicted. The various ways in which the  Hyleg, or Giver of Life, may be afflicted by the Anareta, correspond to  the various modes of death. But astrologers have always been singularly  careful, in casting horoscopes, to avoid definite reference to the  native's death. There are but few cases where the actual day of death is  said to have been assigned. One is related in Clarendon's 'History of  the Rebellion.' He tells us that William Earl of Pembroke died at the  age of fifty, on the day upon which his tutor Sandford had predicted his  decease. Burton, the author of the 'Anatomy of Melancholy,' having cast  his own horoscope, and ascertained that he was to die on January 23,  1639, is said to have committed suicide in order that the accuracy of  his calculations might not be called in question. A similar story is  related of Cardan by Dr. Young (Sidrophel Vapulans), on the authority of  Gassendi, who, however, says only that either Cardan starved himself,  or, being confident in his art, took the predicted day for a fatal one,  and by his fears made it so. Gassendi adds that while Cardan pretended  to describe the fates of his children in his voluminous commentaries, he  all the while never suspected, from the rules of his great art, that his  dearest son would be condemned in the flower of his youth to be beheaded  on a scaffold, by an executioner of justice, for destroying his own wife  by poison.    Horary astrology relates to particular questions, and is a comparatively  easy branch of the science. The art of casting nativities requires many  years of study; but horary astrology 'may be well understood,' says  Lilly, 'in less than a quarter of a year.' 'If a proposition of any  nature,' he adds, 'be made to any individual, about the result of which  he is anxious, and therefore uncertain whether to accede to it or not,  let him but note the hour and minute when it was _first_ made, and erect  a figure of the heavens, and his doubts will be instantly resolved. He  may thus in five minutes learn whether the affair will succeed or not:  and consequently whether it is prudent to accept the offer made or not.  If he examine the sign on the first house of the figure, the planet  therein, or the planet ruling the sign, _will exactly describe the party  making the offer_, both in person and character, and this may at once  convince the enquirer for truth of the reality of the principles of the  science. Moreover, the descending sign, etc., _will describe his own  person and character_--a farther proof of the truth of the science.'    There is one feature of horary astrology which is probably almost as  ancient as any portion of the science, yet which remains even to the  present day, and will probably remain for many years to come. I refer to  the influence which the planets were supposed to exert on the  successive hours of every day--a belief from which the division of time  into weeks of seven days unquestionably had its origin--though we may  concede that the subdivision of the lunar month into four equal parts  was also considered in selecting this convenient measure of time. Every  hour had its planet. Now dividing twenty-four by seven, we get three and  three over; whence, each day containing twenty-four hours, it follows  that in each day the complete series of seven planets was run through  three times, and three planets of the next series were used. The order  of the planets was that of their distances, as indicated above. Saturn  came first, then Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.  Beginning with Saturn, as ruling the first hour of Saturn's day  (Saturday), we get through the above series three times, and have for  the last three hours of the day, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. Thus the  next hour, the first hour of the next day, belongs to the sun--Sunday  follows Saturday. We again run three times through the series, and the  three remaining hours are governed by the sun, Venus, and  Mercury,--giving the moon as the first planet for the next day. Monday  thus follows Sunday. The last three hours of Monday are ruled by the  moon, Saturn, and Jupiter; leaving Mars to govern the next day--Martis  dies, Mardi, Tuesday or Tuisco's day. Proceeding in the same way, we get  Mercury for the next day, Mercurii dies, Mercredi, Wednesday or Woden's  day; Jupiter for the next day, Jovis dies, Jeudi, Thursday or Thor's  day; Venus for the next day, Veneris dies, Vendredi, Friday or Freya's  day; and so we come to Saturday again.[14]    The period of seven days, which had its origin in, and derived its  nomenclature from astrological ideas, shows by its wide prevalence how  widely astrological superstitions were once spread among the nations. As  Whewell remarks (though, for reasons which will readily be understood he  was by no means anxious to dwell upon the true origin of the Sabbatical  week), 'the usage is found over all the East; it existed among the  Arabians, Assyrians, and Egyptians. The same week is found in India,  among the Brahmins; it has there also its days marked by the names of  the heavenly bodies; and it has been ascertained that the same day has,  in that country, the name corresponding with its designation in other  nations.... The period has gone on without interruption or irregularity  from the earliest recorded times to our own days, traversing the extent  of ages and the revolutions of empires; the names of ancient deities,  which were associated with the stars, were replaced by those of the  objects of the worship of our Teutonic ancestors, according to their  views of the correspondence of the two mythologies; and the Quakers, in  rejecting these names of days, have cast aside the most ancient existing  relic of astrological as well as idolatrous superstition.    Not only do the names remain, but some of the observances connected with  the old astrological systems remain even to this day. As ceremonies  derived from Pagan worship are still continued, though modified in form,  and with a different interpretation, in Christian and especially Roman  Catholic observances, so among the Jews and among Christians the rites  and ceremonies of the old Egyptian and Chaldaean astrology are still  continued, though no longer interpreted as of yore. The great Jewish  Lawgiver and those who follow him seem, for example, to have recognised  the value of regular periods of rest (whether really required by man or  become a necessity through long habit), but to have been somewhat in  doubt how best to continue the practice without sanctioning the  superstitions with which it had been connected. At any rate two  different and inconsistent interpretations were given in the earlier and  later codes of law. But whether the Jews accepted the Sabbath because  they believed that an All-powerful Being, having created the world in  six days, required and took rest ('and was refreshed') on the seventh,  as stated in Exodus (xx. 11 and xxxi. 17), or whether they did so in  remembrance of their departure from Egypt, as stated in Deuteronomy (v.  15), there can be no question that among the Egyptians the Sabbath or  Saturn's day was a day of rest because of the malignant nature of the  powerful planet-deity who presided over that day. Nor can it be  seriously doubted that the Jews descended from the old Chaldaeans, among  whom (as appears from stone inscriptions recently discovered) the very  word Sabbath was in use for a seventh day of rest connected with  astrological observances, were familiar with the practice even before  their sojourn in Egypt. They had then probably regarded it as a  superstitious practice to be eschewed like those idolatrous observances  which had caused Terah to remove with Abraham and Lot from Ur of the  Chaldees. At any rate, we find no mention of the seventh day of rest as  a religious observance until after the Exodus.[15] It was not their only  religious observance having in reality an astrological origin. Indeed,  if we examine the Jewish sacrificial system as described in Numbers  xxviii. and elsewhere, we shall find throughout a tacit reference to the  motions or influences of the celestial bodies. There was the morning and  evening sacrifice guided by the movements of the sun; the Sabbath  offering, determined by the predominance of Saturn; the offering of the  new moon, depending on the motions of the moon; and lastly, the Paschal  sacrifice, depending on the combined movements of the sun and  moon--made, in fact, during the lunation following the sun's ascending  passage of the equator at the sign of Aries.    Let us return, however, after this somewhat long digression, to  astrological matters.    Horary astrology is manifestly much better fitted than the casting of  nativities for filling the pocket of the astrologer himself; because  only one nativity can be cast, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26558"],[0,"Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking (#8)"],[1,"in hot oven.
