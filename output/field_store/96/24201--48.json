The  hymenium is sinuous and convolute, bearing basidia with sterigmata and  spores in the cavities. Sometimes the cavities are traversed by  threads, as in the _Myxogastres_. The spores are in many instances  beautifully echinulate, sometimes globose, at others elongated, and  produced in such numbers as to lead to the belief that their  development is successive on the spicules. When fully matured, the  peridia are filled with a dusty mass of spores, so that it is scarcely  possible in this condition to gain any notion of the structure. This  is, indeed, the case with nearly all _Gasteromycetes_. The hypogaeous  fungi are curiously connected with _Phalloidei_ by the genus  _Hysterangium_.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Basidia and spores of _Lycoperdon_.]    TRICHOGASTRES.[T]--In their early stages the species contained in  this group are not gelatinous, as in the _Myxogastres_, but are  rather fleshy and firm. Very little has been added to our knowledge  of structure in this group since 1839 and 1842, when one of us  wrote to the following effect:--If a young plant of _Lycoperdon  coelatum_ or _L. gemmatum_ be cut through and examined with a common  pocket lens, it will be found to consist of a fleshy mass,  perforated in every direction with minute elongated, reticulated,  anastomosing, labyrinthiform cavities. The resemblance of these to the  tubes of _Boleti_ in an early stage of growth, first led me to  suspect that there must be some very close connection between them.  If a very thin slice now be taken, while the mass is yet firm, and  before there is the slightest indication of a change of colour, the  outer stratum of the walls of these cavities is found to consist of  pellucid obtuse cells, placed parallel to each other like the pile  of velvet, exactly as in the young hymenium of an Agaric or  Boletus. Occasionally one or two filaments cross from one wall to  another, and once I have seen these anastomose. At a more advanced  stage of growth, four little spicules are developed at the tips of  the sporophores, all of which, as far as I have been able to observe,  are fertile and of equal height, and on each of these spicules a  globose spore is seated. It is clear that we have here a structure  identical with that of the true Hymenomycetes, a circumstance which  accords well with the fleshy habit and mode of growth. There is some  difficulty in ascertaining the exact structure of the species just  noticed, as the fruit-bearing cells, or sporophores, are very  small, and when the spicules are developed the substance becomes so  flaccid that it is difficult to cut a proper slice, even with the  sharpest lancet. I have, however, satisfied myself as to the true  structure by repeated observations. But should any difficulty arise  in verifying it in the species in question, there will be none in  doing so in _Lycoperdon giganteum_. In this species the fructifying  mass consists of the same sinuous cavities, which are, however,  smaller, so that the substance is more compact, and I have not seen  them traversed by any filaments. In an early stage of growth, the  surface of the hymenium, that is of the walls of the cavities,  consists of short threads composed of two or three articulations,  which are slightly constricted at the joints, from which, especially  from the last, spring short branchlets, often consisting of a  single cell. Sometimes two or more branchlets spring from the same  point. Occasionally the threads are constricted without any  dissepiments, the terminal articulations are obtuse, and soon swell  very much, so as greatly to exceed in diameter those on which they  are seated. When arrived at their full growth, they are somewhat  obovate, and produce four spicules, which at length are surmounted  each with a globose spore. When the spores are fully developed, the  sporophores wither, and if a solution of iodine be applied, which  changes the spores to a rich brown, they will be seen still adhering  by their spicules to the faded sporophores. The spores soon become  free, but the spicule often still adheres to them; but they are not  attached to the intermingled filaments. In _Bovista plumbea_, the  spores have very long peduncles.[U] As in the _Hymenomycetes_, the  prevailing type of reproductive organs consisted of quaternary  spores borne on spicules; so in _Gasteromycetes_, the prevailing  type, in so far as it is yet known, is very similar, in some cases  nearly identical, consisting of a definite number of minute spores  borne on spicules seated on basidia. In a very large number of  genera, the minute structure and development of the fructification  (beyond the mature spores) is almost unknown, but from analogy it  may be concluded that a method prevails in a large group like the  _Myxogastres_ which does not differ in essential particulars from that  which is known to exist in other groups. The difficulties in the way  of studying the development of the spores in this are far greater  than in the previous order.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--_a._ Threads of _Trichia_. _b._ Portion further  magnified, with spores. _c._ Portion of spinulose thread.]    MYXOGASTRES.--At one time that celebrated mycologist, Professor De  Bary, seemed disposed to exclude this group from the vegetable kingdom  altogether, and relegate them to a companionship with amoeboid forms.  But in more recent works he seems to have reconsidered, and almost, if  not entirely, abandoned, that disposition. These fungi, mostly minute,  are characterized in their early stages by their gelatinous nature.  The substance of which they are then composed bears considerable  resemblance to sarcode, and, did they never change from this, there  might be some excuse for doubting as to their vegetable nature; but as  the species proceed towards maturity they lose their mucilaginous  texture, and become a mass of spores, intermixed with threads,  surrounded by a cellular peridium. Take, for instance, the genus  _Trichia_, and we have in the matured specimens a somewhat globose  peridium, not larger than a mustard seed, and sometimes nearly of the  same colour; this ultimately ruptures and exposes a mass of minute  yellow spherical spores, intermixed with threads of the same  colour.[V] These threads, when highly magnified, exhibit in themselves  a spiral arrangement, which has been the basis of some controversy,  and in some species these threads are externally spinulose. The chief  controversy on these threads has been whether the spiral markings are  external or internal, whether caused by twisting of the thread or by  the presence of an external or internal fibre. The spiral appearance  has never been called in question, only the structure from whence it  arises, and this, like the striae of diatoms, is very much an open  question. Mr. Currey held that the spiral appearance may be accounted  for by supposing the existence of an accurate elevation in the wall of  the cell, following a spiral direction from one end of the thread to  the other. This supposition would, he thinks, accord well with the  optical appearances, and it would account exactly for the undulations  of outline to which he alludes. He states that he had in his  possession a thread of _Trichia chrysosperma_, in which the spiral  appearance was so manifestly caused by an elevation of this nature, in  which it is so clear that no internal spiral fibre exists, that he did  not think there could be a doubt in the mind of any person carefully  examining it with a power of 500 diameters that the cause of the  spiral appearance was not a spiral fibre. In _Arcyria_, threads of a  different kind are present; they mostly branch and anastomose, and are  externally furnished with prominent warts or spines, which Mr.  Currey[W] holds are also arranged in a spiral manner around the  threads. In other Myxogastres, threads are also present without any  appreciable spiral markings or spines. In the mature condition of  these fungi, they so clearly resemble, and have such close affinities  with, the Trichogastres that one is led almost to doubt whether it was  not on hasty grounds, without due examination or consideration, that  proposals were made to remove them from the society of their kindred.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Arcyria incarnata_, with portion of threads and  spore, magnified.]    Very little is known of the development of the spores in this group;  in the early stages the whole substance is so pulpy, and in the latter  so dusty, whilst the transition from one to the other is so rapid,  that the relation between the spores and threads, and their mode of  attachment, has never been definitely made out. It has been supposed  that the spinulose projections from the capillitium in some species  are the remains of pedicels from which, the spores have fallen, but  there is no evidence beyond this supposition in its favour, whilst on  the other hand, in _Stemonitis_, for instance, there is a profuse  interlacing capillitium, and no spines have been detected. In order to  strengthen the supposition, spines should be more commonly present.  The threads, or capillitium, form a beautiful reticulated network in  _Stemonitis_, _Cribraria_, _Diachaea_, _Dictydium_, &c. In _Spumaria_,  _Reticularia_, _Lycogala_, &c., they are almost obsolete.[X] In no  group is the examination of the development of structure more  difficult, for the reasons already alleged, than in the Myxogastres.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Diachaea elegans._]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Cyathus vernicosus._]    NIDULARIACEI.--This small group departs in some important particulars  from the general type of structure present in the rest of the  Gasteromycetes.[Y] The plants here included may be described under  three parts, the mycelium, the peridium, and the sporangia. The  mycelium is often plentiful, stout, rigid, interlacing, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#8)"],[1,"ty-five thousand persons had been directly  served by us. They had received our help independently and without  begging. No child has learned to beg at the doors of the Red Cross.    It is to be borne in mind that the fury of the deluge had swept almost  entirely the homes of the wealthy, the elegant, the cultured leaders of  society, and the fathers of the town. This class who were spared were  more painfully homeless than the indigent poor, who could still huddle  in together. They could not go away, for the suffering and demoralized  town needed their care and oversight more than ever before. There was no  home for them, nowhere to get a meal of food or to sleep. Still they  must work on, and the stranger coming to town on business must go  unfed, with no shelter at night, if he would sleep, or, indeed, escape  being picked up by the military guard.    To meet these necessities, and being apprehensive that some good lives  might go out under the existing luck of accommodations, it was decided  to erect a building similar to our warehouse. The use of the former site  of the Episcopal Church was generously tendered us by the Bishop early  in June, for any purpose we might desire. This house, which was soon  erected, was known as the \"Locust Street Red Cross Hotel\"; it stood some  fifty rods from our warehouse, and was fifty by one hundred and sixteen  feet in dimensions, two stories in height, with lantern roof, built of  hemlock, single siding, papered inside with heavy building paper, and  heated by natural gas, as all our buildings were. It consisted of  thirty-four rooms, besides kitchen, laundry, bath-rooms with hot and  cold water, and one main dining-hall and sitting-room through the  center, sixteen feet in width by one hundred in length.    It was fully furnished with excellent beds, bedding, bureaus, tables,  chairs, and all needful housekeeping furniture. A competent landlady,  who, like the rest, had a few weeks before floated down over the same  ground on the roof of her house in thirty feet of water, was placed in  charge, with instructions to keep a good house, make what she could rent  free, but charging no Johnstown person over twenty-five cents for a meal  of food.    This was the first attempt at social life after that terrible  separation, and its success was something that I am very proud of. The  house was full of townspeople from the first day, and strangers no  longer looked in vain for accommodations.    The conception of the need of this house, and the method of selecting  its inmates, and the manner of inducting them into their new home, were  somewhat unique and may be of interest to the reader. I had noticed  among the brave and true men, who were working in the mud and rain, many  refined-looking gentlemen, who were, before this great misfortune  carried away most of their belongings, the wealthiest and most  influential citizens. Never having had to struggle amid such hardships  and deprivations, their sufferings were more acute than those of the  poorer and more hardy people; and it did not require any great  foresight to know that they were physically incapable of such labor if  prolonged, nor to predict their early sickness and death if they were  not properly housed and fed. As the salvation of the town depended in a  great measure upon the efforts of these men, it was vitally necessary  that their lives should be preserved. Realizing all this, it occurred to  us that the most important thing to do, next to feeding the hungry, was  to provide proper shelter for these delicate men and their families. The  idea once conceived was soon communicated to my staff, and, after due  consideration, it was put in the way of realization.    On the afternoon of July 27th hundreds of citizens called on us, and  congratulations and good wishes were the order of the day. As the  members of each family whom we had selected to occupy apartments in the  house arrived, they were quietly taken aside and requested to remain and  have dinner with us. After all the guests were departed except those who  had been requested to remain, dinner was announced, and the party was  seated by the members of the Red Cross. Beside the plate of each head  of a family were laid the keys to an apartment, with a card inviting the  family to take possession at once, and remain as long as they chose.    I can not describe the scene that followed; there were tears and broken  voices; suffice to say, the members of that household were made happy  and comfortable for many long months; and I venture to assert that those  now living recall those days with the fondest recollections.    The contributions to the general committee had been so liberal that it  was possible to erect and provide for the great burial-place of its  dead--\"Grand View,\" that overlooks the city. It was also suggested that  a benevolent society, as a permanent institution, be formed by the  united action of the general committee and the Red Cross. This was  successfully accomplished by the generous provision of eight thousand  dollars from the committee on its part and the turning over of our  well-made and supplied hospital buildings, and the funds we had left  placed in charge of a faithful custodian under our pay for the following  six months.    This is the present \"Union Benevolent Society\" of Johnstown to-day.    I remained five months with these people without once visiting my own  home, only returning to it when the frost had killed the green I had  left in May.    In that time, it was estimated, we had housed, handled, and distributed  $211,000 worth of supplies--new and old--for, by request of the weary  chairman of the general committee, at the last, we took up the close of  its distribution. It is our joy and pride to recall how closely we  worked in connection with that honored committee from first to last, and  how strong and unsullied that friendship has remained.    The value of money that passed through our hands was $39,000, as stated  in the official report of the general committee, to which all required  returns were made, recorded, and published by the committee.    Our usual quota of assistants was fifty persons, the higher grade of men  and women assistants largely volunteers. Two railroads brought our  supplies. To handle these the strongest men were required, and seven  two-horse teams ran daily for three and a half months in the  distribution, at customary rates of pay. These were the workingmen of  the town who had suffered with the rest.    It was a joy that in all the uncertainties of that uncertain field not a  single complaint ever reached us of the non-acknowledgment of a dollar  entrusted to us.    The paths of charity are over roadways of ashes; and he who would tread  them must be prepared to meet opposition, misconstruction, jealousy, and  calumny. Let his work be that of angels--still it will not satisfy all.    In the light of recent events, I may perhaps be pardoned for quoting a  few lines from the official report of the Johnstown Flood Finance  Committee appointed by Governor Beaver, as showing how these gentlemen,  the foremost men in the community, regarded our efforts to give them a  helping hand:    \"In this matter of sheltering the people, as in others of like  importance, Miss Clara Barton, President of the Red Cross Association,  was most helpful. At a time when there was a doubt if the Flood  Commission could furnish houses of suitable character and with the  requisite promptness, she offered to assume charge, and she erected with  the funds of the Association three large apartment houses, which  afforded comfortable lodgings for many houseless people. She was among  the first to arrive on the scene of calamity, bringing with her Dr.  Hubbell, the Field Officer of the Red Cross Association, and a staff of  skilled assistants. She made her own organization for relief work in  every form, disposing of the large resources under her control with such  wisdom and tenderness that the charity of the Red Cross had no sting,  and its recipients are not Miss Barton's dependents, but her friends.  She was also the last of the ministering spirits to leave the scene of  her labors, and she left her apartment houses for use during the winter,  and turned over her warehouse with its store of furniture, bedding, and  clothing, and a well-equipped infirmary, to the Union Benevolent  Association of the Conemaugh Valley, the organization of which she  advised and helped to form; and its lady visitors have so well performed  their work that the dreaded winter has no terrors, mendicancy has been  repressed, and not a single case of unrelieved suffering is known to  have occurred in all the flooded district.\"    Enterprising, industrious, and hopeful, the new Johnstown,  phoenix-like, rose from its ruins more beautiful than the old, with a  ceaseless throb of grateful memory for every kind act rendered, and  every thought of sympathy given her in her great hour of desolation and  woe. God bless her, and God bless all who helped save her!          V    THE RUSSIAN FAMINE      As early as 1889, the foreign journals began to tell us of the  apprehension caused by an unusual failure of the crops in Central  Russia, extending from Moscow north and south, and east beyond the Ural  Mountains and into Siberia--embracing an era of a million square miles.  This failure was followed by another in 1890.    Eighteen hundred and ninety-one found the old-time granaries empty, and  a total failure of the crops, and a population of thirty-five millions  of people, paralyzed with the dread of approaching famine.    The American Red Cross had placed itself in communication with the  Secretary of State, Hon. James G. Blaine, whose name and memory it  treasures with reverence, and Mr. Alexander Gregor, the accomplished  Russian _Charge d'Affaires_ at Washington, and ascertained that Russia  would gladly receive donations of relief from"]]]
