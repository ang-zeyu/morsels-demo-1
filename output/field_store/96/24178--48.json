This disk was sharply bordered by a narrow _black_ ring,  and outside the ring the luminous haze of the nebula again appeared,  gradually fading toward the edge to invisibility. The accompanying cut,  which exaggerates the brightness of the nebula as compared with the  star, gives but a faint idea of this most singular object. If its  peculiarities were within the reach of ordinary telescopes, there are  few scenes in the heavens that would be deemed equally admirable.    In the star eta we have another long-period variable, which is also a  double star; unfortunately the companion, being of only the tenth  magnitude and distant less than 1\" from its third-magnitude primary, is  beyond the reach of our telescopes. But eta points the way to one of the  finest star clusters in the sky, marked 1360 on the map. The naked eye  perceives that there is something remarkable in that place, and the  opera glass faintly reveals its distant splendors, but the telescope  fairly carries us into its presence. Its stars are innumerable, varying  from the ninth magnitude downward to the last limit of visibility, and  presenting a wonderful array of curves which are highly interesting from  the point of view of the nebular origin of such clusters. Looking  backward in time, with that theory to guide us, we can see spiral lines  of nebulous mist occupying the space that now glitters with interlacing  rows of stars. It is certainly difficult to understand how such lines of  nebula could become knotted with the nuclei of future stars, and then  gradually be absorbed into those stars; and yet, if such a process does  not occur, what is the meaning of that narrow nebulous streak in the  Pleiades along which five or six stars are strung like beads on a  string? The surroundings of this cluster, 1360, as one sweeps over them  with the telescope gradually drawing toward the nucleus, have often  reminded me of the approaches to such a city as London. Thicker and  closer the twinkling points become, until at last, as the observers eye  follows the gorgeous lines of stars trending inward, he seems to be  entering the streets of a brilliantly lighted metropolis.    Other objects in Gemini that we can ill miss are: , double, magnitudes  three and eleven, distance 73\", p. 76 deg., colors yellow and blue; 15,  double, magnitudes six and eight, distance 33\", p. 205 deg.; gamma,  remarkable for array of small stars near it; 38, double, magnitudes six  and eight, distance 6.5\", p. 162 deg., colors yellow and blue (very pretty);  lambda, double, magnitudes four and eleven, distance 10\", p. 30 deg., color  of larger star blue--try with the five-inch; epsilon, double, magnitudes  three and nine, distance 110\", p. 94 deg..    From Gemini we pass to Cancer. This constellation has no large stars,  but its great cluster Praesepe (1681 on map No. 4) is easily seen as a  starry cloud with the naked eye. With the telescope it presents the most  brilliant appearance with a very low power. It was one of the first  objects that Galileo turned to when he had completed his telescope, and  he wonderingly counted its stars, of which he enumerated thirty-six, and  made a diagram showing their positions.    The most interesting star in Cancer is zeta, a celebrated triple. The  magnitudes of its components are six, seven, and seven and a half;  distances 1.14\", p. 6 deg., and 5.7\", p. 114 deg.. We must use our five-inch  glass in order satisfactorily to separate the two nearest stars. The  gravitational relationship of the three stars is very peculiar. The  nearest pair revolve around their common center in about fifty-eight  years, while the third star revolves with the other two, around a center  common to all three, in a period of six or seven hundred years. But the  movements of the third star are erratic, and inexplicable except upon  the hypothesis advanced by Seeliger, that there is an invisible, or  dark, star near it by whose attraction its motion is perturbed.    In endeavoring to picture the condition of things in zeta Cancri we  might imagine our sun to have a companion sun, a half or a third as  large as itself, and situated within what may be called planetary  distance, circling with it around their center of gravity; while a third  sun, smaller than the second and several times as far away, and  accompanied by a _black_ or non-luminous orb, swings with the first two  around another center of motion. There you would have an entertaining  complication for the inhabitants of a system of planets!    Other objects in Cancer are: Sigma 1223, double star, magnitudes six and  six and a half, distance 5\", p. 214 deg.; Sigma 1291, double, magnitudes  both six, distance 1.3\", p. 328 deg.--four-inch should split it; iota,  double, magnitudes four and a half and six and a half, distance 30\", p.  308 deg.; 66, double magnitudes six and nine, distance 4.8\", p. 136 deg.; Sigma  1311, double, magnitudes both about the seventh, distance 7\", p. 200 deg.;  1712, star cluster, very beautiful with the five-inch glass.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 5.]    The constellation of Auriga may next command our attention (map No. 5).  The calm beauty of its leading star Capella awakens an admiration that  is not diminished by the rivalry of Orion's brilliants glittering to the  south of it. Although Capella must be an enormously greater sun than  ours, its spectrum bears so much resemblance to the solar spectrum that  a further likeness of condition is suggested. No close telescopic  companion to Capella has been discovered. A ninth-magnitude companion,  distant 159\", p. 146 deg., and two others, one of twelfth magnitude at 78\",  p. 317 deg., the other of thirteenth magnitude at 126\", p. 183 deg., may be  distant satellites of the great star, but not planets in the ordinary  sense, since it is evident that they are self-luminous. It is a  significant fact that most of the first-magnitude stars have faint  companions which are not so distant as altogether to preclude the idea  of physical relationship.    But while Capella has no visible companion, Campbell, of the Lick  Observatory, has lately discovered that it is a conspicuous example of a  peculiar class of binary stars only detected within the closing decade  of the nineteenth century. The nature of these stars, called  spectroscopic binaries, may perhaps best be described while we turn our  attention from Capella to the second star in Auriga beta (Menkalina),  which not only belongs to the same class, but was the first to be  discovered. Neither our telescopes, nor any telescope in existence, can  directly reveal the duplicity of beta Aurigae to the eye--i. e., we can  not see the two stars composing it, because they are so close that their  light remains inextricably mingled after the highest practicable  magnifying power has been applied in the effort to separate them. But  the spectroscope shows that the star is double and that its components  are in rapid revolution around one another, completing their orbital  swing in the astonishingly short period of _four days_! The combined  mass of the two stars is estimated to be two and a half times the mass  of the sun, and the distance between them, from center to center, is  about eight million miles.    The manner in which the spectroscope revealed the existence of two  stars in beta Aurigae is a beautiful illustration of the unexpected and,  so to speak, automatic application of an old principle in the discovery  of new facts not looked for. It was noticed at the Harvard Observatory  that the lines in the photographed spectrum of beta Aurigae (and of a few  other stars to be mentioned later) appeared single in some of the  photographs and double in others. Investigation proved that the lines  were doubled at regular intervals of about two days, and that they  appeared single in the interim. The explanation was not far to seek. It  is known that all stars which are approaching us have their spectral  lines shifted, by virtue of their motion of approach, toward the violet  end of the spectrum, and that, for a similar reason, all stars which are  receding have their lines shifted toward the red end of the spectrum.  Now, suppose two stars to be revolving around one another in a plane  horizontal, or nearly so, to the line of sight. When they are at their  greatest angular distance apart as seen from the earth one of them will  evidently be approaching at the same moment that the other is receding.  The spectral lines of the first will therefore be shifted toward the  violet, and those of the second will be shifted toward the red. Then if  the stars, when at their greatest distance apart, are still so close  that the telescope can not separate them, their light will be combined  in the spectrum; but the spectral lines, being simultaneously shifted in  opposite directions, will necessarily appear to be doubled. As the  revolution of the stars continues, however, it is clear that their  motion will soon cease to be performed in the line of sight, and will  become more and more athwart that line, and as this occurs the spectral  lines will gradually assume their normal position and appear single.  This is the sequence of phenomena in beta Aurigae. And the same sequence  is found in Capella and in several other more or less conspicuous stars  in various parts of the heavens.    Such facts, like those connecting rows and groups of stars with masses  and spiral lines of nebula are obscure signboards, indicating the  opening of a way which, starting in an unexpected direction, leads deep  into the mysteries of the universe.    Southward from beta we find the star theta, which is a beautiful  quadruple. We shall do best with our five-inch here, although in a fine  condition of the atmosphere the four-inch might suffice.

Do you fear that some of the fruit may be taken?  What of it? Plant for beauty, and the fruit is all extra--give it away  freely, and pass on to others some of God's good gifts, to your own true  happiness!    There is another crab-apple that is distinctive in its elegance, color  and fragrance. It is the true \"wild crab\" of Eastern North America, and  one who makes its acquaintance in blooming time will never forget it.  The tree is not large, and it is likely to be set with crooked, thorny  branches; but the flowers! Deep pink or rosy red chalices, rather longer  than the commonplace apple-blossom, and hanging on long and slender  stems in a certain picturesquely stiff disposition, they are a joy for  the senses of sight and fragrance. This notable native may be found on  rich slopes and in dry glades--it is not fond of swamps. It is grown  by some enlightened nurserymen, too, and can well be planted in the home  grounds to their true adornment. The blossoms give way to form handsome  yellow fruits, about an inch in diameter, which are themselves much more  ornamental than edible, for even the small boy will not investigate a  second time the bitter flesh. I have heard that a cider of peculiar  \"hardness\" and potency, guaranteed to unsettle the firmest head, is made  from these acid fruits--but I have not found it necessary to extend my  tree studies in that direction.    [Illustration: The Spectabilis crab in bloom]    The states west of Kansas do not know this lovely wild crab, to which  the botanists give a really euphonious designation as _Pyrus coronaria_.  There is a prairie-states crab-apple, which I have never seen, but  which, I am told, has nothing like the beauty of our exquisite Eastern  native. This Western species lacks the long stem and the bright color of  the flowers of our favorite, and its fruits, while quite as viciously  sour, are a dull and greasy green. The great West has many other things,  but we have the wild crab-apple.    Rather between, as to beauty, is the native crab-apple of the Southland,  which is known as the Soulard crab. It is not as attractive as our own  Eastern gem, a pure native possession, and one which our foreign friends  envy us.    Curiously enough, our own fruiting apple is not a native of America. It  was at a meeting of a New England pomological association that I heard,  several years ago, an old man of marvelous memory and power of  observation tell of his recollections of seventy years, notable among  which was his account of seeing the first good apples, as a boy, during  a visit in the state of New York. Think of it! the most widely grown and  beautiful of all our fruits hardly older than the railroad in America!  We owe the apples we eat to Europe, for the start, the species being  probably of Himalayan origin. America has greatly developed the apple,  however, as one who has looked over the fruit tables at any great  exposition will promptly testify, and nearly all our really good  varieties are of American origin. Moreover, we are the greatest  apple-growers in the world, and the yearly production probably exceeds  a hundred millions of barrels.    [Illustration: Fruits of the wild crab]    The curious story of \"Johnny Appleseed\" is given us by historians, who  tell us of this semi-religious enthusiast who roamed barefoot over the  wilds of Ohio and Indiana a century ago, sowing apple-seeds in the  scattered clearings, and living to see the trees bearing fruit,  selections from which probably are interwoven among the varieties of  today. New varieties of apples, by the way, come from seeds sown, and  trees grown from them, with a bare chance that one in ten thousand may  be worth keeping. When a variety seems thus worthy, \"buds\" or \"scions\"  from the original tree are \"budded\" or \"grafted\" by the nurseryman into  young seedling trees, which are thus changed into the selected sort. To  sow the seeds of your favorite Baldwin does not imply that you will get  Baldwin trees, by any means; you will more likely have a partial  reversion to the acid and bitter original species.    It is not only for the fruit that we are indebted to the Old World, but  also for some distinctively beautiful and most ornamental varieties of  the apple, not by any means as well known among us as they ought to be.  The nurserymen sell as an ornamental small tree a form known as  \"Parkman's double-flowering crab,\" which produces blooms of much beauty,  like delicate little roses. Few of them, however, know of the glorious  show that the spring brings where there is a proper planting of the  Chinese and Japanese crab-apples, with some other hybrids and varieties.  To readers in New England a pilgrimage to Boston is always in order. In  the Public Gardens are superb specimens of these crab-apples from the  Orient, as well as those native to this continent, and for several weeks  in May they may be enjoyed. They _are_ enjoyed by the Bostonians, who  are in this, as in many things, better served by their authorities than  is any other American city. What other city, for instance, gives its  people such a magnificent spring show of hyacinths, tulips, daffodils  and the like?    It is at the wonderful Arnold Arboretum, that Mecca of tree-lovers just  outside of Boston and really within its superbly managed park system,  that the greatest show of the \"pyrus family,\" as the apples and pears  are botanically called, may be found. Here have been gathered the lovely  blooming trees of all the hardy world, to the delight of the eye and the  nose, and the education of the mind. To me the most impressive of all  was a wonderful Siberian crab (one must look for _Pyrus baccata_ on the  label, as the Arboretum folks are not in love with \"common\" names) close  by the little greenhouses. Its round head was purely white, with no  hint of pink, and the mass of bloom that covered it was only punctuated  by the green of the expanding leaves. The especial elegance of this crab  was in its whiteness, and that elegance was not diminished by the later  masses of little yellow and red, almost translucent, fruits.    A somewhat smaller tree is commonly called the Chinese flowering apple,  and its early flowers remind one strongly of the beauty of our own wild  crab, as they are deeper in color than most of the crabs, being almost  coral-red in bud. This \"spectabilis,\" as it is familiarly called, is a  gem, as it opens the season of the apple blooms with its burst of pink  richness.    The beauty-loving Japanese have a festival at the time of the  cherry-blooming--and it is altogether a festival of beauty, not  connected with the food that follows the flowers. They actually dare to  cut the blossoms, too, for adornment, and all the populace take time to  drink in the message of the spring. Will we workaday Americans ever dare  to \"waste\" so much time, and go afield to absorb God's provision of soul  and sense refreshment in the spring, forgetting for the time our shops  and desks, our stores and marts?    [Illustration: The beauty of a fruiting apple branch]    Professor Sargent, that deep student of trees who has built himself a  monument, which is also a beneficence to all mankind, in the great  volumes of his \"Silva of North America,\" lives not far from Boston, and  he loves especially that jewel of the apple family which, for want of a  common name, I must designate scientifically as _Pyrus floribunda_. On  his own magnificent estate, as well as at the Arboretum, this superb  shrub or small tree riots in rosy beauty in early spring. While the  leaves do come with these flowers, they are actually crowded back out of  apparent sight by the straight wands of rose-red blooms, held by the  twisty little tree at every angle and in indescribable beauty. If the  visitor saw nothing but this Floribunda apple--\"abundant flowering\" sure  enough--on his pilgrimage, he might well be satisfied, especially if he  then and there resolved to see it again, either as he planted it at home  or journeyed hither another spring for the enlargement of his soul.    There are other of these delightful crabs or apples to be  enjoyed--Ringo, Kaido, Toringo--nearly all of Japanese origin, all of  distinct beauty, and all continuing that beauty in handsome but inedible  fruits that hang most of the summer. My tree-loving friends can well  study these, and, I hope, plant them, instead of repeating continually  the monotonously familiar shrubs and trees of ordinary commerce.    But I have not spoken enough of one notable feature of the every-day  apple tree that we may see without a journey to the East. The fully set  fruiting branch of an apple tree in health and vigor, properly nurtured  and protected against fungous disease by modern \"spraying,\" is a thing  of beauty in its form and color. See those deep red Baldwins shine  overhead in the frosty air of early fall; note the elegance of form and  striping on the leathery-skinned Ben Davis; appreciate true apples of  gold set in green enamel on a tree of the sunny Bellefleur! These in the  fall; but it is hardly full summer before the closely set branches of  Early Harvest are as beautiful as any orange-tree, or the more upright  Red Astrachan is ablaze with fruit of red and yellow. Truly, an apple  orchard might be arranged to give a series of pictures of changing  beauty of color and growth from early spring until fall frost, and then  to follow with a daily panorama of form and line against snow and sky  until the blossoms peeped forth again. Let us learn, if we do not  already love the apple tree, to love it for its beauty all the year!
