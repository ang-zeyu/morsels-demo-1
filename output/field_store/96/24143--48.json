In the April of 1815, a  mastership of chancery became vacant by the death of Mr. Morris; and  forthwith the Chancellor was assailed with entreaties from every  direction for the vacant post. For two months Eldon, pursuing that  policy of which he was a consummate master, delayed to appoint; but  on June 23, he disgusted the bar and shocked the more intelligent  section of London society, by conferring the post on Jekyll, the  courtly _bon vivant_ and witty descendant of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master  of the Rolls. Amiable, popular, and brilliant, Jekyll received the  congratulations of his numerous personal friends; but beyond the  circle of his private acquaintance the appointment created lively  dissatisfaction--dissatisfaction which was heightened rather than  diminished by the knowledge that the placeman's good fortune was  entirely due to the personal importunity of the Prince Regent, who  called at the Chancellor's house, and having forced his way into the  bedroom, to which Eldon was confined by an attack of gout, refused  to take his departure without a promise that his friend should have  the vacant place. How this royal influence was applied to the  Chancellor, is told in the 'Anecdote Book.'    Fortunately Jekyll was less incompetent for the post than his enemies  had declared, and his friends admitted. He proved a respectable master,  and held his post until age and sickness compelled him to resign it;  and then, sustained in spirits by the usual retiring pension, he  sauntered on right mirthfully into the valley of the shadow of death. On  the day after his retirement, the jocose veteran, meeting Eldon in the  street, observed:--\"Yesterday, Lord Chancellor, I was your master;  to-day I am my own.\"    From Bedford Square, Lord Eldon, for once following the fashion, moved  to Hamilton Place, Piccadilly. With the purpose of annoying him the  'Queen's friends,' during the height of the 'Queen Caroline agitation,'  proposed to buy the house adjoining the Chancellor's residence in  Hamilton Place, and to fit it up for the habitation of that not  altogether meritorious lady. Such an arrangement would have been an  humiliating as well as exasperating insult to a lawyer who, as long as  the excitement about the poor woman lasted, would have been liable to  affront whenever he left his house or looked through the windows facing  Hamilton Place. The same mob that delighted in hallooing round whatever  house the Queen honored with her presence, would have varied their  'hurrahs' for the lady with groans for the lawyer who, after making her  wrongs the stalking-horse of his ambition, had become one of her chief  oppressors. Eldon determined to leave Hamilton Place on the day which  should see the Queen enter it; and hearing that the Lords of the  Treasury were about to assist her with money for the purchase of the  house, he wrote to Lord Liverpool, protesting against an arrangement  which would subject him to annoyance at home and to ridicule out of  doors. \"I should,\" he wrote, \"be very unwilling to state anything  offensively, but I cannot but express my confidence that Government will  not aid a project which must remove the Chancellor from his house the  next hour that it takes effect, and from his office at the same time.\"  This decided attitude caused the Government to withdraw their  countenance from the project; whereupon a public subscription was opened  for its accomplishment. Sufficient funds were immediately proffered; and  the owner of the mansion had verbally made terms with the patriots, when  the Chancellor, outbidding them, bought the house himself. \"I had no  other means,\" he wrote to his daughter, \"of preventing the destruction  of my present house as a place in which I could live, or which anybody  else would take. The purchase-money is large, but I have already had  such offers, that I shall not, I think, lose by it.\"    Russell Square--where Lord Loughborough (who knows aught of the Earl of  Rosslyn?) had his town house, after leaving Lincoln's Inn Fields, and  where Charles Abbott (Lord Tenterden) established himself on leaving the  house in Queen Square, into which he married during the summer of  1795--maintained a quasi-fashionable repute much later than the older  and therefore more interesting parts of the 'old law quarter.' Theodore  Hook's disdain for Bloomsbury is not rightly appreciated by those who  fail to bear in mind that the Russell Square of Hook's time was tenanted  by people who--though they were unknown to 'fashion,' in the sense given  to the word by men of Brummel's habit and tone--had undeniable status  amongst the aristocracy and gentry of England. With some justice the  witty writer has been charged with snobbish vulgarity because he  ridiculed humble Bloomsbury for being humble. His best defence is found  in the fact that his extravagant scorn was not directed at helpless and  altogether obscure persons so much as at an educated and well-born class  who laughed at his caricatures, and gave dinners at which he was proud  to be present. Though it fails to clear the novelist of the special  charge, this apology has a certain amount of truth; and in so far as it  palliates some of his offences against good taste and gentle feeling, by  all means let him have the full benefit of it. Criticism can afford to  be charitable to the clever, worthless man, now that no one admires or  tries to respect him. Again, it may be advanced, in Hook's behalf, that  political animosity--a less despicable, though not less hurtful passion  than love of gentility--contributed to Hook's dislike of the quarter on  the north side of Holborn. As a humorist he ridiculed, as a panderer to  fashionable prejudices he sneered at, Bloomsbury; but as a tory he  cherished a genuine antagonism to the district of town that was  associated in the public mind with the wealth and ascendency of the  house of Bedford. Anyhow, the Russell Square neighborhood--although it  was no longer fashionable, as Belgravia and Mayfair are fashionable at  the present day--remained the locality of many important families, at  the time when Mr. Theodore Hook was pleased to assume that no one above  the condition of a rich tradesman or second-rate attorney lived in it.  Of the lawyers whose names are mournfully associated with the square  itself are Sir Samuel Romilly and Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd. In 1818, the  year of his destruction by his own hand, Sir Samuel Romilly lived there;  and Talfourd had a house on the east side of the square up to the time  of his lamented death in 1854.    That Theodore Hook's ridicule of Bloomsbury greatly lessened for a time  the value of its houses there is abundant evidence. When he deluged the  district with scornful satire, his voice was a social power, to which a  considerable number of honest people paid servile respect. His clever  words were repeated; and Bloomsbury having become a popular by-word for  contempt, aristocratic families ceased to live, and were reluctant to  invest money, in its well-built mansions. But Hook only accelerated a  movement which had for years been steadily though silently making  progress. Erskine knew Red Lion Square when every house was occupied by  a lawyer of wealth and eminence, if not of titular rank; but before he  quitted the stage, barristers had relinquished the ground in favor of  opulent shopkeepers. When an ironmonger became the occupant of a house  in Red Lion Square on the removal of a distinguished counsel, Erskine  wrote the epigram--       \"This house, where once a lawyer dwelt,       Is now a smith's,--alas!     How rapidly the iron age       Succeeds the age of brass.\"    These lines point to a minor change in the social arrangements of  London, which began with the century, and was still in progress when  Erskine had for years been mouldering in his grave. In 1823, the year of  Erskine's death, Chief Baron Richards expired in his town house, in  Great Ormond Street. In the July of the following year Baron  Wood--_i.e._, George Wood, the famous special pleader--died at his house  in Bedford Square, about seventeen months after his resignation of his  seat in the Court of Exchequer to John Hullock.    At the present time the legal fraternity has deserted Bloomsbury. The  last of the Judges to depart was Chief Baron Pollock, who sold his great  house in Queen Square at a quite recent date. With the disappearance of  this venerable and universally respected judge, the legal history of the  neighborhood may be said to have closed. Some wealthy solicitors still  live in Russell Square and the adjoining streets; a few old-fashioned  barristers still linger in Upper Bedford Place and Lower Bedford Place.  Guilford Street and Doughty Street, and the adjacent thoroughfares of  the same class, still number a sprinkling of rising juniors, literary  barristers, and fairly prosperous attorneys. Perhaps the ancient aroma  of the 'old law quarter'--Mesopotamia, us it is now disrespectfully  termed--is still strong and pleasant enough to attract a few lawyers who  cherish a sentimental fondness for the past.

'Now,' said Taffy, 'I want you to go to my Mummy, because your legs are  longer than mine, and you won't fall into the beaver-swamp, and ask for  Daddy's other spear--the one with the black handle that hangs over our  fireplace.'    The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, 'This is a very, very  wonderful child. She waves her arms and she shouts at me, but I don't  understand a word of what she says. But if I don't do what she wants, I  greatly fear that that haughty Chief, Man-who-turns-his-back-on-callers,  will be angry.' He got up and twisted a big flat piece of bark off a  birch-tree and gave it to Taffy. He did this, Best Beloved, to show that  his heart was as white as the birch-bark and that he meant no harm; but  Taffy didn't quite understand.    'Oh!' said she. 'Now I see! You want my Mummy's living-address? Of  course I can't write, but I can draw pictures if I've anything sharp to  scratch with. Please lend me the shark's tooth off your necklace.'    The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) didn't say anything, So Taffy  put up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and seed and  shark-tooth necklace round his neck.    The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, 'This is a very, very,  very wonderful child. The shark's tooth on my necklace is a magic  shark's tooth, and I was always told that if anybody touched it without  my leave they would immediately swell up or burst, but this  child doesn't swell up or burst, and that important Chief,  Man-who-attends-strictly-to-his-business, who has not yet taken any  notice of me at all, doesn't seem to be afraid that she will swell up or  burst. I had better be more polite.'    So he gave Taffy the shark's tooth, and she lay down flat on her tummy  with her legs in the air, like some people on the drawing-room floor  when they want to draw pictures, and she said, 'Now I'll draw you some  beautiful pictures! You can look over my shoulder, but you mustn't  joggle. First I'll draw Daddy fishing. It isn't very like him; but Mummy  will know, because I've drawn his spear all broken. Well, now I'll draw  the other spear that he wants, the black-handled spear. It looks as if  it was sticking in Daddy's back, but that's because the shark's tooth  slipped and this piece of bark isn't big enough. That's the spear I want  you to fetch; so I'll draw a picture of me myself 'splaining to you. My  hair doesn't stand up like I've drawn, but it's easier to draw that way.  Now I'll draw you. I think you're very nice really, but I can't make you  pretty in the picture, so you mustn't be 'fended. Are you 'fended?'    The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) smiled. He thought, 'There must  be a big battle going to be fought somewhere, and this extraordinary  child, who takes my magic shark's tooth but who does not swell up or  burst, is telling me to call all the great Chief's tribe to help him. He  is a great Chief, or he would have noticed me.    'Look,' said Taffy, drawing very hard and rather scratchily, 'now I've  drawn you, and I've put the spear that Daddy wants into your hand, just  to remind you that you're to bring it. Now I'll show you how to find my  Mummy's living-address. You go along till you come to two trees (those  are trees), and then you go over a hill (that's a hill), and then you  come into a beaver-swamp all full of beavers. I haven't put in all the  beavers, because I can't draw beavers, but I've drawn their heads, and  that's all you'll see of them when you cross the swamp. Mind you don't  fall in! Then our Cave is just beyond the beaver-swamp. It isn't as high  as the hills really, but I can't draw things very small. That's my Mummy  outside. She is beautiful. She is the most beautifullest Mummy there  ever was, but she won't be 'fended when she sees I've drawn her so  plain. She'll be pleased of me because I can draw. Now, in case you  forget, I've drawn the spear that Daddy wants outside our Cave. It's  inside really, but you show the picture to my Mummy and she'll give it  you. I've made her holding up her hands, because I know she'll be so  pleased to see you. Isn't it a beautiful picture? And do you quite  understand, or shall I 'splain again?'    The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) looked at the picture and nodded  very hard. He said to himself,' If I do not fetch this great Chief's  tribe to help him, he will be slain by his enemies who are coming up on  all sides with spears. Now I see why the great Chief pretended not to  notice me! He feared that his enemies were hiding in the bushes and  would see him. Therefore he turned to me his back, and let the wise and  wonderful child draw the terrible picture showing me his difficulties.  I will away and get help for him from his tribe.' He did not even ask  Taffy the road, but raced off into the bushes like the wind, with the  birch-bark in his hand, and Taffy sat down most pleased.    Now this is the picture that Taffy had drawn for him!    'What have you been doing, Taffy?' said Tegumai. He had mended his spear  and was carefully waving it to and fro.    'It's a little berangement of my own, Daddy dear,' said Taffy. 'If you  won't ask me questions, you'll know all about it in a little time, and  you'll be surprised. You don't know how surprised you'll be, Daddy!  Promise you'll be surprised.'    'Very well,' said Tegumai, and went on fishing.    The Stranger-man--did you know he was a Tewara?--hurried away with the  picture and ran for some miles, till quite by accident he found Teshumai  Tewindrow at the door of her Cave, talking to some other Neolithic  ladies who had come in to a Primitive lunch. Taffy was very like  Teshumai, especially about the upper part of the face and the eyes,  so the Stranger-man--always a pure Tewara--smiled politely and handed  Teshumai the birch-bark. He had run hard, so that he panted, and his  legs were scratched with brambles, but he still tried to be polite.    As soon as Teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything and flew  at the Stranger-man. The other Neolithic ladies at once knocked him down  and sat on him in a long line of six, while Teshumai pulled his hair.    'It's as plain as the nose on this Stranger-man's face,' she said. 'He  has stuck my Tegumai all full of spears, and frightened poor Taffy so  that her hair stands all on end; and not content with that, he brings  me a horrid picture of how it was done. Look!' She showed the picture to  all the Neolithic ladies sitting patiently on the Stranger-man. 'Here is  my Tegumai with his arm broken; here is a spear sticking into his back;  here is a man with a spear ready to throw; here is another man throwing  a spear from a Cave, and here are a whole pack of people' (they were  Taffy's beavers really, but they did look rather like people) 'coming up  behind Tegumai. Isn't it shocking!'    'Most shocking!' said the Neolithic ladies, and they filled the  Stranger-man's hair with mud (at which he was surprised), and they beat  upon the Reverberating Tribal Drums, and called together all the chiefs  of the Tribe of Tegumai, with their Hetmans and Dolmans, all Neguses,  Woons, and Akhoonds of the organisation, in addition to the Warlocks,  Angekoks, Juju-men, Bonzes, and the rest, who decided that before they  chopped the Stranger-man's head off he should instantly lead them down  to the river and show them where he had hidden poor Taffy.    By this time the Stranger-man (in spite of being a Tewara) was really  annoyed. They had filled his hair quite solid with mud; they had rolled  him up and down on knobby pebbles; they had sat upon him in a long  line of six; they had thumped him and bumped him till he could hardly  breathe; and though he did not understand their language, he was almost  sure that the names the Neolithic ladies called him were not ladylike.  However, he said nothing till all the Tribe of Tegumai were assembled,  and then he led them back to the bank of the Wagai river, and there they  found Taffy making daisy-chains, and Tegumai carefully spearing small  carp with his mended spear.    'Well, you have been quick!' said Taffy. 'But why did you bring so many  people? Daddy dear, this is my surprise. Are you surprised, Daddy?'    'Very,' said Tegumai; 'but it has ruined all my fishing for the day.  Why, the whole dear, kind, nice, clean, quiet Tribe is here, Taffy.'    And so they were. First of all walked Teshumai Tewindrow and the  Neolithic ladies, tightly holding on to the Stranger-man, whose hair was  full of mud (although he was a Tewara). Behind them came the Head Chief,  the Vice-Chief, the Deputy and Assistant Chiefs (all armed to the upper  teeth), the Hetmans and Heads of Hundreds, Platoffs with their Platoons,  and Dolmans with their Detachments; Woons, Neguses, and Akhoonds ranking  in the rear (still armed to the teeth). Behind them was the Tribe in  hierarchical order, from owners of four caves (one for each season), a  private reindeer-run, and two salmon-leaps, to feudal and prognathous  Villeins, semi-entitled to half a bearskin of winter nights, seven yards  from the fire, and adscript serfs, holding the reversion of a scraped  marrow-bone under heriot (Aren't those beautiful words, Best Beloved?).  They were all there, prancing and shouting, and they frightened every  fish for twenty miles, and Tegumai thanked them in a fluid Neolithic  oration.    Then Teshumai Tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged Taffy very much  indeed; but the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai took Tegumai by the  top-knot feathers and shook him severely.    'Explain! Explain! Explain!' cried all the Tribe of Tegumai.    'Goodness' sakes alive!' said Tegumai. 'Let go of my top-knot. Can't  a man break his carp-spear without the whole countryside descending on  him? You're a very interfering people.'    'I don't believe you've brought my Daddy's black-handled spear after  all,' said Taffy. "]]]
