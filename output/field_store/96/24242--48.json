Kline and  Edward Lee, a one-half interest in his U.S. patent 7,776 which was  issued on November 12, 1850 (fig. 23).    [Illustration: Figure 23.--WILSON'S PATENT MODEL, 1850. (Smithsonian  photo 45504-H.)]    Inventor Wilson had been associated with Kline and Lee (E. Lee & Co.)  for only a few months, when, on November 25, 1850, he agreed to sell his  remaining interest to his partners for $2,000. He retained only limited  rights for New Jersey and for Massachusetts. The sale was fruitless for  the inventor, as no payment was ever made. How much money E. E. Lee &  Co. realized from the Wilson machine is difficult to determine, but they  ran numerous ads in the 1851 and 1852 issues of _Scientific American_. A  typical one reads:         A. B. Wilson's Sewing Machine, justly allowed to be the cheapest       and best now in use, patented November 12, 1850; can be seen on       exhibition at 195 and 197 Broadway (formerly the Franklin House,       Room 23, third floor) or to E. E. Lee & Co., Earle's Hotel. Rights       for territory or machines can be had by applying to George R.       Chittenden, Agent.[48]    [Illustration: Figure 24.--WILSON'S PREPATENT MODEL for his rotary hook,  1851. (Smithsonian photo 45506-E.)]    [Illustration: Figure 25.--WILSON'S ROTARY-HOOK PATENT MODEL, 1851.  (Smithsonian photo 45505-B.)]    Another reads:         A. B. Wilson's Sewing Machine ... the best and only practical       sewing machine--not larger than a lady's work box--for the trifling       sum of $35.[49]    Wilson severed relations with Lee and Kline in early 1851 shortly after  meeting Nathaniel Wheeler, who was to become his partner in a happier,  more profitable enterprise involving the sewing machine.    [Illustration: Figure 26.--WILSON'S stationary-bobbin patent model,  1852; a commercial machine was used since Wheeler, Wilson, Co. had begun  manufacturing machines the previous year. (Smithsonian photo 45504-B.)]    Wilson, with his two partners, was occupying a room in the old Sun  Building at 128 Fulton Street, when Wheeler, on a business trip to New  York City, learned of the Wilson sewing machine. Wheeler examined the  machine, saw its possibilities, and at once contracted with E. Lee & Co.  to make 500 of them. At the same time he engaged Wilson to go with him  to Watertown, Connecticut, to perfect the machine and supervise its  manufacture. Meanwhile, Wilson had been working on a substitute for the  shuttle. He showed his model of the device, which became known as the  rotary hook, to Wheeler who was so convinced of its superiority that he  decided to develop this new machine and leave Wilson's first machine to  the others, who, by degrees, had become its owners.    Wilson now applied all his effort to improving the rotary hook, for  which he received his second patent on August 12, 1851 (figs. 24 and  25). Wheeler, his two partners Warren and Woodruff, and Wilson now  formed a new copartnership--Wheeler, Wilson, and Company. They began the  manufacture of the machines under the patent, which combined the rotary  hook and a reciprocating bobbin. The rotary hook extended or opened more  widely the loop of the needle thread, while a reciprocating bobbin  carried its thread through the extended loop. To avoid litigation which  the reciprocating bobbin might have caused, Wilson contrived his third  outstanding invention--the stationary bobbin. This was a feature of the  first machine produced by the new company in 1851, though the patent  for the stationary bobbin was not issued until June 15, 1852 (fig. 26).    In all reciprocating-shuttle machines a certain loss of power is  incurred in driving forward, stopping, and bringing back the shuttle at  each stitch; also, the machines are rather noisy, owing to the striking  of the driver against the shuttle at each stroke. These objections were  removed by Wilson's rotary hook and stationary bobbin. The locking of  the needle thread with the bobbin thread was accomplished, not by  driving a shuttle through the loop of the needle thread, but by passing  that loop under the bobbin. The driving shaft carried the circular  rotary hook, one of the sewing machine's most beautiful contrivances.  The success of the machine is indicated in an article that appeared in  the June 1853 issue of _Scientific American_:         There are 300 of these machines now in operation in various parts       of the country, and the work which they can perform cannot be       surpassed.... The time must soon come when every private family       that has much sewing to do, will have one of these neat and perfect       machines; indeed many private families have them now.... The price       of one all complete is $125; every machine is made under the eye of       the inventor at the company's machine shop, Watertown, Connecticut,       so that every one is warranted ... agreement between Mr. Howe and       Messrs. Wheeler, Wilson & Co., so every customer will be perfectly       protected....[50]    [Illustration: Figure 27.--WILSON'S four-motion-feed patent model, 1854,  is not known to be in existence; this is a commercial machine of the  period. The plate is stamped \"A. B. Wilson, Patented Aug. 12, 1851,  Watertown, Conn., No. 1....\" (Smithsonian photo 45504.)]    This agreement was important to sales, as Elias Howe was known to have  sued purchasers of machines, as well as rival inventors and companies.    The business was on a substantial basis by October 1853, and a stock  company was formed under the name of Wheeler & Wilson Manufacturing  Company.[51] A little more than a year later, on December 19, 1854,  Wilson's fourth important patent (U.S. patent 12,116)--for the  four-motion cloth feed--was issued to him (fig. 27). In this  development, the flat-toothed surface in contact with the cloth moved  forward carrying the cloth with it; then it dropped a little, so as not  to touch the cloth; next it moved backward; then in the fourth motion it  pushed up against the cloth and was ready to repeat the forward  movements. This simple and effective feed method is still used today,  with only minor modifications, in almost every sewing machine. This feed  with the rotary hook and the stationary circular-disk bobbin, completed  the essential features of Wilson's machine. It was original and  fundamentally different from all other machines of that time.    The resulting Wheeler and Wilson machine made a lockstitch by means of a  curved eye-pointed needle carried by a vibrating arm projecting from a  rock shaft connected by link and eccentric strap with an eccentric on  the rotating hook shaft. This shaft had at its outer end the rotary  hook, provided with a point adapted to enter the loop of needle thread.  As the hook rotated, it passed into and drew down the loop of  needle-thread, which was held by means of a loop check, while the point  of the hook entered a new loop. When the first loop was cast off--the  face of the hook being beveled for that purpose--it was drawn upward by  the action of the hook upon the loop through which it was then passing.  During the rotation of the hook each loop was passed around a disk  bobbin provided with the second thread and serving the part of the  shuttle in other machines. The four-motion feed was actuated in this  machine by means of a spring bar and a cam in conjunction with the  mandrel.    From the beginning, Wheeler and Wilson had looked beyond the use of the  sewing machine solely by manufacturers and had seen the demand for a  light-running, lightweight machine for sewing in the home. Wilson's  inventions lent themselves to this design, and Wheeler and Wilson led  the way to the introduction of the machine as a home appliance. Other  manufacturers followed.    When the stock company was formed, Mr. Wilson retired from active  participation in the business at his own request. His health had not  been good, and a nervous condition made it advisable for him to be freed  from the responsibility of daily routine. During this period Wilson's  inventive contributions to the sewing machine continued as noted, and in  addition he worked on inventions concerning cotton picking and  illuminating gases.    Wheeler and Wilson's foremost competitor in the early years of  sewing-machine manufacture was the Singer Company, which overtook them  by 1870 and finally absorbed the entire Wheeler and Wilson Manufacturing  Company in 1905.    The founder of this most successful 19th-century company was Isaac  Singer, a native of Pittstown, New York.[52] Successively a mechanic, an  actor, and an inventor, Singer came to Boston in 1850 to promote his  invention of a machine for carving printers' wooden type. He exhibited  the carving machine in Orson Phelps' shop, where the Blodgett and Lerow  machines were being manufactured.    Because the carving machine evoked but little interest, Singer turned  his attention to the sewing machine as a device offering considerable  opportunity for both improvement and financial reward. Phelps liked  Singer's ideas and joined with George Zieber, the publisher who had been  backing the carving-machine venture, to support Singer in the work of  improving the sewing machine. His improvements in the Blodgett and Lerow  machine included a table to hold the cloth horizontally rather than  vertically (this had been used by Bachelder and Wilson also), a yielding  vertical presser foot to hold the cloth down as the needle was drawn up,  and a vertically reciprocating straight needle driven by a rotary,  overhanging shaft.    The story of the invention and first trial of the machine was told by  Singer in the course of a patent suit sometime later:         I explained to them how the work was to be fed over the table and       under the presser-foot, by a wheel, having short pins on its       periphery, projecting through a slot in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3268"],[0,"The Mysteries of Udolpho (#8)"],[1,"Italian  poets; while Emily's pencil enabled her to preserve some of those  combinations of forms, which charmed her at every step.    The loneliness of the road, where, only now and then, a peasant was seen  driving his mule, or some mountaineer-children at play among the rocks,  heightened the effect of the scenery. St. Aubert was so much struck with  it, that he determined, if he could hear of a road, to penetrate further  among the mountains, and, bending his way rather more to the south, to  emerge into Rousillon, and coast the Mediterranean along part of that  country to Languedoc.    Soon after mid-day, they reached the summit of one of those cliffs,  which, bright with the verdure of palm-trees, adorn, like gems, the  tremendous walls of the rocks, and which overlooked the greater part of  Gascony, and part of Languedoc. Here was shade, and the fresh water of  a spring, that, gliding among the turf, under the trees, thence  precipitated itself from rock to rock, till its dashing murmurs were  lost in the abyss, though its white foam was long seen amid the darkness  of the pines below.    This was a spot well suited for rest, and the travellers alighted to  dine, while the mules were unharnessed to browse on the savoury herbs  that enriched this summit.    It was some time before St. Aubert or Emily could withdraw their  attention from the surrounding objects, so as to partake of their little  repast. Seated in the shade of the palms, St. Aubert pointed out to her  observation the course of the rivers, the situation of great towns, and  the boundaries of provinces, which science, rather than the eye, enabled  him to describe. Notwithstanding this occupation, when he had talked  awhile he suddenly became silent, thoughtful, and tears often swelled to  his eyes, which Emily observed, and the sympathy of her own heart told  her their cause. The scene before them bore some resemblance, though it  was on a much grander scale, to a favourite one of the late Madame St.  Aubert, within view of the fishing-house. They both observed this, and  thought how delighted she would have been with the present landscape,  while they knew that her eyes must never, never more open upon this  world. St. Aubert remembered the last time of his visiting that spot in  company with her, and also the mournfully presaging thoughts which had  then arisen in his mind, and were now, even thus soon, realized! The  recollections subdued him, and he abruptly rose from his seat, and  walked away to where no eye could observe his grief.    When he returned, his countenance had recovered its usual serenity; he  took Emily's hand, pressed it affectionately, without speaking, and soon  after called to the muleteer, who sat at a little distance, concerning  a road among the mountains towards Rousillon. Michael said, there were  several that way, but he did not know how far they extended, or even  whether they were passable; and St. Aubert, who did not intend to travel  after sun-set, asked what village they could reach about that time. The  muleteer calculated that they could easily reach Mateau, which was in  their present road; but that, if they took a road that sloped more to  the south, towards Rousillon, there was a hamlet, which he thought they  could gain before the evening shut in.    St. Aubert, after some hesitation, determined to take the latter course,  and Michael, having finished his meal, and harnessed his mules, again  set forward, but soon stopped; and St. Aubert saw him doing homage to a  cross, that stood on a rock impending over their way. Having concluded  his devotions, he smacked his whip in the air, and, in spite of the  rough road, and the pain of his poor mules, which he had been lately  lamenting, rattled, in a full gallop, along the edge of a precipice,  which it made the eye dizzy to look down. Emily was terrified almost  to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending still greater danger from  suddenly stopping the driver, was compelled to sit quietly, and trust  his fate to the strength and discretion of the mules, who seemed to  possess a greater portion of the latter quality than their master; for  they carried the travellers safely into the valley, and there stopped  upon the brink of the rivulet that watered it.    Leaving the splendour of extensive prospects, they now entered this  narrow valley screened by     Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic spell,   Here scorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green.    The scene of barrenness was here and there interrupted by the spreading  branches of the larch and cedar, which threw their gloom over the cliff,  or athwart the torrent that rolled in the vale. No living creature  appeared, except the izard, scrambling among the rocks, and often  hanging upon points so dangerous, that fancy shrunk from the view of  them. This was such a scene as SALVATOR would have chosen, had he then  existed, for his canvas; St. Aubert, impressed by the romantic character  of the place, almost expected to see banditti start from behind some  projecting rock, and he kept his hand upon the arms with which he always  travelled.    As they advanced, the valley opened; its savage features gradually  softened, and, towards evening, they were among heathy mountains,  stretched in far perspective, along which the solitary sheep-bell was  heard, and the voice of the shepherd calling his wandering flocks to the  nightly fold. His cabin, partly shadowed by the cork-tree and the ilex,  which St. Aubert observed to flourish in higher regions of the air than  any other trees, except the fir, was all the human habitation that yet  appeared. Along the bottom of this valley the most vivid verdure was  spread; and, in the little hollow recesses of the mountains, under the  shade of the oak and chestnut, herds of cattle were grazing. Groups  of them, too, were often seen reposing on the banks of the rivulet, or  laving their sides in the cool stream, and sipping its wave.    The sun was now setting upon the valley; its last light gleamed upon the  water, and heightened the rich yellow and purple tints of the heath and  broom, that overspread the mountains. St. Aubert enquired of Michael  the distance to the hamlet he had mentioned, but the man could not with  certainty tell; and Emily began to fear that he had mistaken the road.  Here was no human being to assist, or direct them; they had left the  shepherd and his cabin far behind, and the scene became so obscured in  twilight, that the eye could not follow the distant perspective of the  valley in search of a cottage, or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon still  marked the west, and this was of some little use to the travellers.  Michael seemed endeavouring to keep up his courage by singing; his  music, however, was not of a kind to disperse melancholy; he sung, in a  sort of chant, one of the most dismal ditties his present auditors had  ever heard, and St. Aubert at length discovered it to be a vesper-hymn  to his favourite saint.    They travelled on, sunk in that thoughtful melancholy, with which  twilight and solitude impress the mind. Michael had now ended his ditty,  and nothing was heard but the drowsy murmur of the breeze among the  woods, and its light flutter, as it blew freshly into the carriage. They  were at length roused by the sound of fire-arms. St. Aubert called to  the muleteer to stop, and they listened. The noise was not repeated; but  presently they heard a rustling among the brakes. St. Aubert drew forth  a pistol, and ordered Michael to proceed as fast as possible; who had  not long obeyed, before a horn sounded, that made the mountains ring. He  looked again from the window, and then saw a young man spring from the  bushes into the road, followed by a couple of dogs. The stranger was in  a hunter's dress. His gun was slung across his shoulders, the hunter's  horn hung from his belt, and in his hand was a small pike, which, as  he held it, added to the manly grace of his figure, and assisted the  agility of his steps.    After a moment's hesitation, St. Aubert again stopped the carriage, and  waited till he came up, that they might enquire concerning the hamlet  they were in search of. The stranger informed him, that it was only half  a league distant, that he was going thither himself, and would readily  shew the way. St. Aubert thanked him for the offer, and, pleased with  his chevalier-like air and open countenance, asked him to take a seat  in the carriage; which the stranger, with an acknowledgment, declined,  adding that he would keep pace with the mules. 'But I fear you will be  wretchedly accommodated,' said he: 'the inhabitants of these mountains  are a simple people, who are not only without the luxuries of life,  but almost destitute of what in other places are held to be its  necessaries.'    'I perceive you are not one of its inhabitants, sir,' said St. Aubert.    'No, sir, I am only a wanderer here.'    The carriage drove on, and the increasing dusk made the travellers very  thankful that they had a guide; the frequent glens, too, that now opened  among the mountains, would likewise have added to their perplexity.  Emily, as she looked up one of these, saw something at a great distance  like a bright cloud in the air. 'What light is yonder, sir?' said she.    St. Aubert looked, and perceived that it was the snowy summit of a  mountain, so much higher than any around it, that it still reflected the  sun's rays, while those below lay in deep shade.    At length, the village lights were seen to twinkle through the dusk,  and, soon after, some cottages were discovered in the valley, or rather  were seen by reflection in the stream, on whose margin they stood, and  which still gleamed with the evening light.    The stranger now came up, and St. Aubert, on further enquiry, found not  only that there was no inn in the place, but not any sort of house of  public reception. The stranger, however, offered to walk on, and"]]]
