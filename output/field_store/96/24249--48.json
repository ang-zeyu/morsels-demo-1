Copyright, 1897, by                            Thomas Taylor, M. D.,                                    and                                A. R. Taylor.          ASCOMYCETES.      Fruit, consisting of sporidia, mostly definite, contained in asci,  springing from a naked or enclosed stratum of fructifying cells, and  forming a hymenium.--Cooke and Berkeley.    Prof. J. de Seyne states that the three elements which form the hymenium  in the families Hymenomycetes and Gasteromycetes are (1) the normal  basidium, that is, the fruitful club-shaped cell which supports the  naked spores, (2) the cystidium or sterile cell, an aborted or atrophied  basidium, and (3) the paraphyses, hypertrophied basidium, the one organ,  the basidium, being the basis of it all, according as it experiences an  arrest of development, as it grows and fructifies, or as it becomes  hypertrophied.    In the family Ascomycetes a minute ascus or spore case envelops the  sporidia, and takes the place of the basidium, and the hymenium consists  of (1) the asci containing the sporidia, (2) the paraphyses, and (3) a  colorless or yellowish mucilage which envelops the paraphyses and asci.  The asci are present in all species. In some species, however, the  paraphyses are rare, and the mucilaginous substance is entirely wanting.  The asci differ in shape and size, according to the species. The  paraphyses, when present, are at first very short, but they rapidly  elongate, and are wholly developed before the appearance of the asci.  They are linear, simple or branched according to the species of plant,  usually containing oily granules. There is some difference of opinion  among mycologists as to the special functions of the paraphyses, some  considering them as abortive asci, and others, like Boudier, as  excitatory organs for the dehiscence of the asci, by which the spores  are liberated.    The family Ascomycetes is rich in genera and species.    It consists largely of microscopic fungi, however, and the only group  which will be considered here is that which includes plants of the  mushroom family which are edible and indigenous to this country, viz.,  the sub-family Discomycetes.          DISCOMYCETES.      The name Discomycetes, \"disk-like fungi,\" does not give an accurate idea  of the distinguishing characteristics of this sub-family, the discoid  form only belonging to the plants of one of its groups. In the  Discomyceteae the hymenium is superior, that is, disposed upon the upper  or exterior surface of the mushroom cap. The sporidia are produced in  membraneous asci, usually four or eight, or some multiple of that  number, in each ascus; Cooke says \"rarely four, most commonly eight.\"  The sporidia are usually hyaline, transparent; colored sporidia are  rare.    The asci are so minute as to be imperceptible to the naked eye; but if a  small portion of the upper surface of the cap is removed with a pen  knife and placed under a microscope having a magnifying power of from  400 to 800 diameters, the asci, or spore sacks, can be separated and  their structure studied.    Of the genera included in the Discomycetes the genus Peziza comprises by  far the largest number of described species. The plants in this genus  are generally small, thin, and tough. A few of them have been recorded  as edible by European authors, but not specially commended; one form,  Peziza _cochleata_, has been spoken of by Berkeley as being gathered in  basketfuls in one county in England, where it is used as a substitute,  though a very indifferent one, for the Morel.    Vittadini says the Verpa _digitaliformis_ Persoon, a small  brownish-colore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#8)"],[1," color. Too dark tail coverts  approaching a greenish black sometimes occur and are undesirable. In  type this variety will not average quite as good as the White.    _The White Runner._ This variety is best in type and it likewise runs  good in color which should be white throughout. Sometimes foreign color  will be shown in the back of females and this of course must be avoided.  Also avoid birds as breeders with green or mottled bills.    [Illustration: FIG. 14. Penciled Runner Drake on left and White Runner  Drake on right. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    _The Penciled Runner._ In type this variety runs about the same as the  Fawn and White. The color combination is rather difficult to breed as it  is hard to get the good penciling desired in the female together with  the white markings. In general, in breeding this variety there is a  tendency to pay more attention to type than to color. The penciling is  like that of the Rouen but lighter in color consisting of a brown  penciling on a fawn colored ground. Avoid any grayish stippling on the  breast of the drake and also on the wing-bows. These defects are likely  to be associated with colored flights which are undesirable. The colored  portion of the head of the drake is darker than that of the duck in this  variety. Avoid lack of white on the neck in both sexes and avoid females  which are lacking in penciling.    _Preparing Ducks for the Show._ Aside from selecting the individuals  which most nearly approach the standard requirements there is very  little which can be done in the way of preparing the birds for the show  as these fowls are practically self-prepared. For a period of at least a  week or ten days before they are shipped to the show those intended for  exhibition should be given access to a grass range and also if possible  to running water. The grass range will keep them in good condition and  the running water will allow them to clean themselves. Any broken  feathers should be plucked at least six weeks before the birds are to be  shown in order to allow the feathers time enough to grow out again. It  must be remembered that most ducks after getting in a good condition of  flesh do not tend to hold this for a very long period but soon grow  thinner again and will not take on fat the second time for some little  period.    Often there will be a difference in weight as high as 3 pounds when a  duck is in good condition and after it has thinned. In order to have the  ducks in top form, therefore, it is necessary to bring them up to flesh  at the proper time. In order to bring ducks which are to be exhibited up  to standard weight, they should be fed twice daily, for at least 10 days  before shipping, a grain mixture consisting of one part corn and two  parts oats. Give them all they will eat of this mixture. With Runners  and the small breeds of ducks there is a danger of their putting on too  much weight if corn is used in the ration and it is therefore best to  give them oats alone. When the birds are shipped to the show they are  quite likely to get their plumage soiled during the journey. When this  occurs fill a barrel about half full of water. Then as the ducks are  taken out of the shipping coops take three of them at a time, put them  in the barrel and cover it over, leaving them for a few minutes. When  they are taken out they will usually be clean.      Catching and Handling Ducks    Ducks should never be caught by the legs which are short and weak and  are very likely to be injured. For the same reason they should never be  carried by the legs. Ducks should be caught by the neck, grasping them  just below the head. They can be carried short distances without injury  in this way but it is not advisable to carry fat ducks by the neck for  any considerable distance. The best way to handle them is to catch them  by the neck, then carry them on the arm with the legs in the hand just  as one would carry a chicken. See Fig. 15. A scoop net about 18 inches  in diameter and with a six foot handle can also be used to excellent  advantage in catching ducks.    [Illustration: FIG. 15. Two methods of carrying ducks. (_Photographs  from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]      Packing and Shipping Hatching Eggs    Eggs for hatching must be shipped when they are fresh as duck eggs tend  to deteriorate in quality quite rapidly. They may be shipped fairly long  distances. Shipment may be made either by express or by Parcel Post. In  order to prevent breakage and to lessen the effects of the jar to which  the eggs are subjected during shipment, they must be carefully packed.  One of the best methods is to use an ordinary market basket. Line the  basket well on the bottom and sides with excelsior. Wrap each egg in  paper and then wrap in excelsior so that there will be a good thick  cushion of excelsior between the eggs and they will not be allowed to  come in contact with one another. Pack the eggs in the basket securely  standing them on end so that they cannot move or shift around. Cover  the top of the eggs with a thick layer of excelsior using enough so that  it runs up well above the sides of the basket. Over the top sew a piece  of strong cotton cloth. Instead of sewing the cloth it can be pushed up  under the outside rim of the basket with a case knife, this being  quicker and equally as effective as sewing.          CHAPTER III    Commercial Duck Farming--Location--Estimate of Equipment and Capital  Necessary in Starting the Business      _Distribution._ Commercial Duck farming is confined very largely to the  sections within easy shipping distance of the larger cities. A great  majority of these farms are located about New York City, particularly on  Long Island. Some duck farms are located on the Pacific Coast and a few  commercial plants are scattered about here and there throughout the  country. The size of these farms ranges all the way from plants with an  output of 5,000 or 10,000 ducklings up to those with an output around  100,000 yearly.    _Stock Used._ The stock used on the commercial duck plants of the United  States consists exclusively of the Pekin. The reasons for the use of  this particular breed are the fact that it has white plumage and  therefore dresses out well, that it is of good size, that its egg  production is good, and that it makes quick growth.    _Location of Plant._ On Long Island the commercial duck plants are  located along the streams, especially those on the southern shore of the  Island, which empty into the various bays. Locations along these  streams are not easy to secure at the present time owing to the fact  that duck farms are not allowed in many sections where summer homes have  been built. A water site of this sort is very valuable, although not  absolutely essential, since it provides water yards for the breeding  ducks and for the fattening ducklings if desired, and reduces the labor  and cost of equipment materially since the ducks always have access to  water and no additional provision need be made to provide them with  drinking water. It also enables the ducks to keep their plumage clean.  Usually these locations are on fresh water streams but some of them are  further out toward the bay where the water is salty or at least  brackish.    The mature ducks thrive well on the salt water and do not have to be  furnished with fresh drinking water in addition. For the young ducks,  however, with a salt water location it is necessary to provide fresh  drinking water. A few farms in other sections of the country are what  are known as dry land farms, that is to say, they are not situated on  the bank of a stream. In such locations running water is carried through  the yards so that the ducks have an ample supply of drinking water and  in some cases artificial ponds are constructed to provide water in which  the breeding ducks can swim. Formerly the idea was universally held that  swimming water was essential for the breeders in order to secure good  fertility, and many duck farmers still believe that better results can  be secured in this way. On some of the dry land duck farms, however,  breeding ducks are successfully kept without such swimming places. The  young market ducklings do not require water to swim in although some  raisers prefer to have it and it is commonly allowed where readily  available. On the dry land farms provision is made simply for a  continuous supply of fresh drinking water for the fattening ducklings.  Ducklings kept out of the water, do not take as much exercise and, in  consequence, fatten a little more readily.      Making a Start in Duck Farming    Duck farms or plants are sometimes operated on a considerable scale at  the beginning, the plans being carefully laid by some experienced duck  man. In these cases, operations at the start may be of sufficient  magnitude so that the output will amount to 15,000 or 20,000 ducklings  in a year. In most cases, however, these places have been the result of  a more gradual growth from a small beginning, a condition made necessary  either by the inexperience of the grower or by lack of capital. Not  infrequently men engaged in other forms of farming but possessing a  suitable location will keep 200 or 300 breeding ducks and from this  gradually build up a good sized duck plant.    _Equipment, Capital, etc. Required._ The estimates given as to the  amount of equipment and capital required are based on the assumption  that a plant is to be operated of sufficient size to have a yearly  output of about 30,000 ducklings. It must be understood in this  connection that location and various other conditions or circumstances  will influence the cost of different items of equipment and for this  reason these estimates must not be considered as absolute but should  rather serve as a guide or basis on which to figure.
