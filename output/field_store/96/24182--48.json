With the horse, there seems hardly a  doubt that bony exostoses on the legs, caused by too much travelling on  hard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records the case of a man who had his  little finger on the right hand almost cut off, and which in consequence  grew crooked, and his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly  crooked. A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage, lost his left eye  from purulent ophthalmia, and his {24} two sons were microphthalmic on the  same side.[62] In all such cases, if truthfully reported, in which the  parent has had an organ injured on one side, and more than one child has  been born with the same organ affected on the same side, the chances  against mere coincidence are enormous. But perhaps the most remarkable and  trustworthy fact is that given by Dr. Brown-Sequard,[63] namely, that many  young guinea-pigs inherited an epileptic tendency from parents which had  been subjected to a particular operation, inducing in the course of a few  weeks a convulsive disease like epilepsy: and it should be especially noted  that this eminent physiologist bred a large number of guinea-pigs from  animals which had not been operated on, and not one of these manifested the  epileptic tendency. On the whole, we can hardly avoid admitting, that  injuries and mutilations, especially when followed by disease, or perhaps  exclusively when thus followed, are occasionally inherited.    Although many congenital monstrosities are inherited, of which examples  have already been given, and to which may be added the lately recorded case  of the transmission during a century of hare-lip with a cleft-palate in the  writer's own family,[64] yet other malformations are rarely or never  inherited. Of these later cases, many are probably due to injuries in the  womb or egg, and would come under the head of non-inherited injuries or  mutilations. With plants, a long catalogue of inherited monstrosities of  the most serious and diversified nature could easily be given; and with  plants, there is no reason to suppose that monstrosities are caused by  direct injuries to the seed or embryo.    _Causes of Non-inheritance._    A large number of cases of non-inheritance are intelligible on the  principle, that a strong tendency to inheritance does exist, but {25} that  it is overborne by hostile or unfavourable conditions of life. No one would  expect that our improved pigs, if forced during several generations to  travel about and root in the ground for their own subsistence, would  transmit, as truly as they now do, their tendency to fatten, and their  short muzzles and legs. Dray-horses assuredly would not long transmit their  great size and massive limbs, if compelled to live on a cold, damp  mountainous region; we have indeed evidence of such deterioration in the  horses which have run wild on the Falkland Islands. European dogs in India  often fail to transmit their true character. Our sheep in tropical  countries lose their wool in a few generations. There seems also to be a  close relation between certain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of an  enlarged tail in fat-tailed sheep, which form one of the most ancient  breeds in the world. With plants, we have seen that the American varieties  of maize lose their proper character in the course of two or three  generations, when cultivated in Europe. Our cabbages, which here come so  true by seed, cannot form heads in hot countries. Under changed  circumstances, periodical habits of life soon fail to be transmitted, as  the period of maturity in summer and winter wheat, barley, and vetches. So  it is with animals; for instance, a person whose statement I can trust,  procured eggs of Aylesbury ducks from that town, where they are kept in  houses and are reared as early as possible for the London market; the ducks  bred from these eggs in a distant part of England, hatched their first  brood on January 24th, whilst common ducks, kept in the same yard and  treated in the same manner, did not hatch till the end of March; and this  shows that the period of hatching was inherited. But the grandchildren of  these Aylesbury ducks completely lost their early habit of incubation, and  hatched their eggs at the same time with the common ducks of the same  place.    Many cases of non-inheritance apparently result from the conditions of life  continually inducing fresh variability. We have seen that when the seeds of  pears, plums, apples, &c., are sown, the seedlings generally inherit some  degree of family likeness from the parent-variety. Mingled with these  seedlings, a few, and sometimes many, worthless, wild-looking plants  commonly appear; and their appearance may be attributed to the principle of  reversion. But scarcely a single seedling will be found {26} perfectly to  resemble the parent-form; and this, I believe, may be accounted for by  constantly recurring variability induced by the conditions of life. I  believe in this, because it has been observed that certain fruit-trees  truly propagate their kind whilst growing on their own roots, but when  grafted on other stocks, and by this process their natural state is  manifestly affected, they produce seedlings which vary greatly, departing  from the parental type in many characters.[65] Metzger, as stated in the  ninth chapter, found that certain kinds of wheat brought from Spain and  cultivated in Germany, failed during many years to reproduce themselves  truly; but that at last, when accustomed to their new conditions, they  ceased to be variable,--that is, they became amenable to the power of  inheritance. Nearly all the plants which cannot be propagated with any  approach to certainty by seed, are kinds which have long been propagated by  buds, cuttings, offsets, tubers, &c., and have in consequence been  frequently exposed during their individual lives to widely diversified  conditions of life. Plants thus propagated become so variable, that they  are subject, as we have seen in the last chapter, even to bud-variation.  Our domesticated animals, on the other hand, are not exposed during their  individual lives to such extremely diversified conditions, and are not  liable to such extreme variability; therefore they do not lose the power of  transmitting most of their characteristic features. In the foregoing  remarks on non-inheritance, crossed breeds are of course excluded, as their  diversity mainly depends on the unequal development of characters derived  from either parent, modified by the principles of reversion and prepotency.    _Conclusion._    It has, I think, been shown in the early part of this chapter how strongly  new characters of the most diversified nature, whether normal or abnormal,  injurious or beneficial, whether affecting organs of the highest or most  trifling importance, are inherited. Contrary to the common opinion, it is  often sufficient for the inheritance of some peculiar character, that one  parent alone should possess it, as in most cases in which the rarer {27}  anomalies have been transmitted. But the power of transmission is extremely  variable: in a number of individuals descended from the same parents, and  treated in the same manner, some display this power in a perfect manner,  and in some it is quite deficient; and for this difference no reason can be  assigned. In some cases the effects of injuries or mutilations apparently  are inherited; and we shall see in a future chapter that the effects of the  long-continued use and disuse of parts are certainly inherited. Even those  characters which are considered the most fluctuating, such as colour, are  with rare exceptions transmitted much more forcibly than is generally  supposed. The wonder, indeed, in all cases is not that any character should  be transmitted, but that the power of inheritance should ever fail. The  checks to inheritance, as far as we know them, are, firstly, circumstances  hostile to the particular character in question; secondly, conditions of  life incessantly inducing fresh variability; and lastly, the crossing of  distinct varieties during some previous generation, together with reversion  or atavism--that is, the tendency in the child to resemble its  grand-parents or more remote ancestors instead of its immediate parents.  This latter subject will be fully discussed in the following chapter.           *       *       *       *       *      {28}    CHAPTER XIII.    INHERITANCE _continued_--REVERSION OR ATAVISM.

The great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has been  recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations, as shown by  the scientific term _Atavism_, derived from atavus, an ancestor; by the  English terms of _Reversion_, or _Throwing back_; by the French  _Pas-en-arriere_; and by the German _Rueck-schlag_, or _Rueck-schritt_.  When the child resembles either grandparent more closely than its immediate  parents, our attention is not much arrested, though in truth the fact is  highly remarkable; but when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1,"have got as good poems by the Shannon or the Suir or by sweet  Ana Life'?\"    \"They are good rivers,\" was the answer. \"They all belong to good gods.\"    \"But why did you choose this river out of all the rivers?\"    Finegas beamed on his pupil.    \"I would tell you anything,\" said he, \"and I will tell you that.\"    Fionn sat at the kindly man's feet, his hands absent among tall grasses,  and listening with all his ears. \"A prophecy was made to me,\" Finegas  began. \"A man of knowledge foretold that I should catch the Salmon of  Knowledge in the Boyne Water.\"    \"And then?\" said Fionn eagerly.    \"Then I would have All Knowledge.\"    \"And after that?\" the boy insisted.    \"What should there be after that?\" the poet retorted.    \"I mean, what would you do with All Knowledge?\"    \"A weighty question,\" said Finegas smilingly. \"I could answer it if I  had All Knowledge, but not until then. What would you do, my dear?\"    \"I would make a poem,\" Fionn cried.    \"I think too,\" said the poet, \"that that is what would be done.\"    In return for instruction Fionn had taken over the service of his  master's hut, and as he went about the household duties, drawing the  water, lighting the fire, and carrying rushes for the floor and the  beds, he thought over all the poet had taught him, and his mind dwelt on  the rules of metre, the cunningness of words, and the need for a clean,  brave mind. But in his thousand thoughts he yet remembered the Salmon of  Knowledge as eagerly as his master did. He already venerated Finegas  for his great learning, his poetic skill, for an hundred reasons; but,  looking on him as the ordained eater of the Salmon of Knowledge, he  venerated him to the edge of measure. Indeed, he loved as well as  venerated this master because of his unfailing kindness, his patience,  his readiness to teach, and his skill in teaching.    \"I have learned much from you, dear master,\" said Fionn gratefully.    \"All that I have is yours if you can take it,\" the poet answered, \"for  you are entitled to all that you can take, but to no more than that.  Take, so, with both hands.\"    \"You may catch the salmon while I am with you,\" the hopeful boy mused.  \"Would not that be a great happening!\" and he stared in ecstasy across  the grass at those visions which a boy's mind knows.    \"Let us pray for that,\" said Finegas fervently.    \"Here is a question,\" Fionn continued. \"How does this salmon get wisdom  into his flesh?\"    \"There is a hazel bush overhanging a secret pool in a secret place. The  Nuts of Knowledge drop from the Sacred Bush into the pool, and as they  float, a salmon takes them in his mouth and eats them.\"    \"It would be almost as easy,\" the boy submitted, \"if one were to set on  the track of the Sacred Hazel and eat the nuts straight from the bush.\"    \"That would not be very easy,\" said the poet, \"and yet it is not as easy  as that, for the bush can only be found by its own knowledge, and that  knowledge can only be got by eating the nuts, and the nuts can only be  got by eating the salmon.\"    \"We must wait for the salmon,\" said Fionn in a rage of resignation.        CHAPTER X    Life continued for him in a round of timeless time, wherein days and  nights were uneventful and were yet filled with interest. As the day  packed its load of strength into his frame, so it added its store of  knowledge to his mind, and each night sealed the twain, for it is in the  night that we make secure what we have gathered in the day.    If he had told of these days he would have told of a succession of meals  and sleeps, and of an endless conversation, from which his mind would  now and again slip away to a solitude of its own, where, in large hazy  atmospheres, it swung and drifted and reposed. Then he would be back  again, and it was a pleasure for him to catch up on the thought that was  forward and re-create for it all the matter he had missed. But he could  not often make these sleepy sallies; his master was too experienced a  teacher to allow any such bright-faced, eager-eyed abstractions, and as  the druid women had switched his legs around a tree, so Finegas chased  his mind, demanding sense in his questions and understanding in his  replies.    To ask questions can become the laziest and wobbliest occupation of a  mind, but when you must yourself answer the problem that you have posed,  you will meditate your question with care and frame it with precision.  Fionn's mind learned to jump in a bumpier field than that in which he  had chased rabbits. And when he had asked his question, and given his  own answer to it, Finegas would take the matter up and make clear to him  where the query was badly formed or at what point the answer had begun  to go astray, so that Fionn came to understand by what successions a  good question grows at last to a good answer.    One day, not long after the conversation told of, Finegas came to the  place where Fionn was. The poet had a shallow osier basket on his arm,  and on his face there was a look that was at once triumphant and gloomy.  He was excited certainly, but he was sad also, and as he stood gazing on  Fionn his eyes were so kind that the boy was touched, and they were yet  so melancholy that it almost made Fionn weep. \"What is it, my master?\"  said the alarmed boy.    The poet placed his osier basket on the grass.    \"Look in the basket, dear son,\" he said. Fionn looked.    \"There is a salmon in the basket.\"    \"It is The Salmon,\" said Finegas with a great sigh. Fionn leaped for  delight.    \"I am glad for you, master,\" he cried. \"Indeed I am glad for you.\"    \"And I am glad, my dear soul,\" the master rejoined.    But, having said it, he bent his brow to his hand and for a long time he  was silent and gathered into himself.    \"What should be done now?\" Fionn demanded, as he stared on the beautiful  fish.    Finegas rose from where he sat by the osier basket.    \"I will be back in a short time,\" he said heavily. \"While I am away you  may roast the salmon, so that it will be ready against my return.\"    \"I will roast it indeed,\" said Fionn.    The poet gazed long and earnestly on him.    \"You will not eat any of my salmon while I am away?\" he asked.    \"I will not eat the littlest piece,\" said Fionn.    \"I am sure you will not,\" the other murmured, as he turned and walked  slowly across the grass and behind the sheltering bushes on the ridge.    Fionn cooked the salmon. It was beautiful and tempting and savoury as  it smoked on a wooden platter among cool green leaves; and it looked all  these to Finegas when he came from behind the fringing bushes and sat  in the grass outside his door. He gazed on the fish with more than his  eyes. He looked on it with his heart, with his soul in his eyes, and  when he turned to look on Fionn the boy did not know whether the love  that was in his eyes was for the fish or for himself. Yet he did know  that a great moment had arrived for the poet.    \"So,\" said Finegas, \"you did not eat it on me after all?\" \"Did I not  promise?\" Fionn replied.    \"And yet,\" his master continued, \"I went away so that you might eat the  fish if you felt you had to.\"    \"Why should I want another man's fish?\" said proud Fionn.    \"Because young people have strong desires. I thought you might have  tasted it, and then you would have eaten it on me.\"    \"I did taste it by chance,\" Fionn laughed, \"for while the fish was  roasting a great blister rose on its skin. I did not like the look of  that blister, and I pressed it down with my thumb. That burned my thumb,  so I popped it in my mouth to heal the smart. If your salmon tastes as  nice as my thumb did,\" he laughed, \"it will taste very nice.\"    \"What did you say your name was, dear heart?\" the poet asked.    \"I said my name was Deimne.\"    \"Your name is not Deimne,\" said the mild man, \"your name is Fionn.\"    \"That is true,\" the boy answered, \"but I do not know how you know it.\"    \"Even if I have not eaten the Salmon of Knowledge I have some small  science of my own.\"    \"It is very clever to know things as you know them,\" Fionn replied  wonderingly. \"What more do you know of me, dear master?\"    \"I know that I did not tell you the truth,\" said the heavy-hearted man.    \"What did you tell me instead of it?\"    \"I told you a lie.\"    \"It is not a good thing to do,\" Fionn admitted. \"What sort of a lie was  the lie, master?\" \"I told you that the Salmon of Knowledge was to be  caught by me, according to the prophecy.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That was true indeed, and I have caught the fish. But I did not tell  you that the salmon was not to be eaten by me, although that also was in  the prophecy, and that omission was the lie.\"    \"It is not a great lie,\" said Fionn soothingly.    \"It must not become a greater one,\" the poet replied sternly.    \"Who was the fish given to?\" his companion wondered.    \"It was given to you,\" Finegas answered. \"It was given to Fionn, the son  of Uail, the son of Baiscne, and it will be given to him.\"    \"You shall have a half of the fish,\" cried Fionn.    \"I will not eat a piece of its skin that is as small as the point of its  smallest bone,\" said the resolute and trembling bard. \"Let you now eat  up the fish, and I shall watch you and give praise to the gods of the  Underworld and of the Elements.\"    Fionn then ate the Salmon of Knowledge, and when it had disappeared a  great jollity and tranquillity and exuberance returned to the poet.    \"Ah,\" said he, \"I had a great combat with that fish.\"    \"Did it fight for its life?\" Fionn inquired.    \"It did, but that was not the fight I meant.\"    \"You shall eat a Salmon of Knowledge too,\" Fionn assured him.    \"You have eaten one,\" cried the blithe poet, \"and if you make such a  promise it will be because you know.\"    \"I promise it and know it,\" said Fionn, \"you shall eat a Salmon of  Knowledge yet.\"        CHAPTER XI    He had received all that he could get from Finegas. His education was  finished and the time had come to test it, and to "]]]
