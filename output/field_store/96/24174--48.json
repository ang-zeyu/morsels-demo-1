The real universe is the  invisible. There is nothing that can not be thrown into the invisible.  Even the diamond has been thrown into solution, and all solutions may be  thrown into the invisible by heat. The question, What is matter? has  puzzled the best minds of earth, and puzzled all, both infidels and  Christians, as much as any other question. The visible, organic universe  was created, but it was created out of the invisible. The invisible is  eternal. There is an eternal world, and that is the invisible and real  universe, without which the visible would not be, for of nothing,  nothing comes. All matter is to be referred to antecedent  substance--that which lies under and causes it to be. Substance,  strictly speaking, lies in the invisible. Matter, properly speaking, is  an effect, which is the visible manifestation of an unseen substance,  and this is eternal.    God created the universe by means of eternal substance. He is the king  eternal. The time never was when he was the king of nothing. It is said  of Leibnitz that he thought inert matter insufficient to explain the  phenomena of body, and had recourse to the entelechies of Aristotle, or  the _substantial forms_ of scholastic philosophy, conceiving of them as  primitive forces, constituting the substance of matter, atoms of  substance, but not of matter _imperishable_, but subject to  transformation. This view of the atomic theory is two-fold: First, the  atomic invisible, as the very term _atom_ indicates, for it is from \"ha  temno,\" which means _not cut_--literally _indivisible_. You can't cut an  atom chemically or otherwise, unless you are working upon that which is  an atom in the loose and more modern sense of the term. You may reduce  matter chemically to the invisible or underlying substance, but beyond  this you can not cut? Can you run it into nothing? No. Into nothing  nothing goes. Physicists are indebted to the oldest philosophers, who  lived prior to Democrites, for the use of the term atom. Those oldest  philosophers used the term to indicate something that was not matter,  viz: immaterial substance. The term in its primary sense is applicable  nowhere else.    The invisible world of substance is undoubtedly eternal. But those men  who try to make this fact an argument against the existence of God are  guilty of the most stupid nonsense and impudence, for, having allowed  eternity not only to substance, but to _material_ substance, they have  no right in logic to deny eternity to life and mind; because it is as  easy, and as rational, to conceive of the eternity of one thing known to  exist as of another. But the idea that the visible world is eternal is  in direct conflict with the facts of science, which establish beyond  contradiction the mutable nature of all organized bodies. Aristotle,  though a believer in the existence of God, did affirm the world's  eternity, and therefore held that there never was any first male or  female in the history of any animals whatsoever, but affirmed, on the  contrary that one begat another infinitely, without any beginning. This  thought was so repugnant to common sense that Aristotle himself seemed  to be skeptical about it, admitting it to be a disputable thing. After  affirming his notion he added, \"If the world had a beginning, and if men  were once earth-born, then must they have been, in all probability,  either generated as worms, out of putrefaction, or else out of eggs.\"  But the question comes up for an answer, From whence came the eggs?    Old Epicurus, after Aristotle, fancied that the first men and animals  were formed in certain wombs or bags growing out of the earth, by a  fortuitous concourse of dead atoms. Here we have the last _home stretch_  of all physicists in their efforts to get rid of the Christian idea of  creation; beyond it no modern infidel has traveled in his speculations,  nor ever will.    But if men were formed from eggs growing out of the earth, or from bags,  or from wombs created by a fortuitous concourse of dead atoms, by  chance, why, the motion of atoms being as brisk and vigorous as ever,  should we not expect the same thing to occur occasionally throughout all  the ages?    Anaximander, however, concluded that men, because they require longer  time than other animals to be hatched up, were at first generated in the  bellies of fishes, and there nourished till they were able to defend and  shift for themselves, and were then disgorged and cast upon dry land. So  we are driven to the conclusion that there is nothing in the world too  absurd for those men, both ancient and modern, to swallow down in their  efforts to get rid of the notion of an intelligent creation by the hand  of an intelligent creator.          ESTOPPELS; OR, FOSSILIZATION.      In our religion we find no law requiring uniformity of thought. Think  the same things. Be of the same opinion. These and like statements are  no part of our religion. Faith and opinion are not the same. All  Christians have one faith, \"the faith of Christ.\" \"Be of the same mind  and of the same judgment.\" \"Speak the same things.\" These are to be  taken in their proper relations. The made up judgment is the result of  faith in the judgment of Christ. \"I judge nothing by myself; he that  judgeth me is the Lord.\" The one great mind enjoined is the result of  thought upon the one great subject of the life of Christ, which is given  as the light of men. These imperatives are summed up in the beautiful  expression, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.\"  Uniformity of thoughts or opinions is a very different thing. A man  would be considered worse than a knave who would throw chains around the  human intellect, so as to put an end to progress in thought; it would be  the stagnation of all in which we are most interested. Christians are  not to be charged with any such wickedness, for they are using all their  powers to produce thought; money and talent are freely bestowed in many  ways to get men to think, and then decide, not in reference to opinions  but facts; not in reference to things which are matters of opinion only,  but of the living object of faith, Christ and Christian duty. There is  no system of things in which investigation, liberty of thought and  action, upon all matters of interest to our humanity, both as respects  this world and the world to come, is more encouraged and insisted upon.  Wicked and unholy thoughts only are prohibited.    Who would paint every flower of the same hue? Who would trim all the  trees of the forest into one and the same shape? Or, who is so foolish  as to want all faces cast into one mould? Who would chain human thought  or mould the opinions of men so that they should not only be one in  Christ, the greatest living fact in history, but one in every other  being known in the world's history--one in opinions? The freeist thing  in the universe is thought. The liberties of thought are charter  liberties from the King of Kings. The spirit of man is free in its  normal state. You can not chain it in slavery against its will. No. It  knows no servitude but the voluntary. But, then, its wanderings are  many. In the field of search after beauty, rectitude and truth, many  minds may come into collision. But greater evils would result from  chaining them all to one spot, and thus ending progress in many things  of interest lying in the realm of thought. Of all the varieties known  among men those of thought are the most sublime and useful.    This variety causes the investigation of every interest; it brings every  truth and every error to the surface.    Men have made many attempts to check the onward march of intellect. But  every attempt in that direction is marked by some great dread. Men are  not anxious to put on the brakes unless they are in fear of being  wrecked. Nothing is more dangerous in any government than perfect  indifference to public interests. Men in places of public trust always  need watching. Irresponsible power, it is said, would corrupt an  archangel, and is, doubtless, unknown among the inhabitants of the  better land. Among men there is great liability. Every political  candidate has his accusations, his promises, and scheme, with which he  confronts his rival and agitates the minds of the people. So we have  been saved from that stagnation of thought which has retarded progress  among other nations. Many men, seeking office, have been wise enough to  see the danger to their interests of an expose of corruption. So they  have been perfectly willing that mechanics, artisans and farmers should  investigate and expose to public view all the questions of interest  belonging to our government, but good Christians, \"and especially  preachers, entering the field of political investigation, at once  forfeit their right to the crown of life.(?)\"    But just how it is that lawyers, doctors and politicians will all reach  heaven in spite of political action, and preachers will sink to  perdition on account of the same, is a problem among problems that has  never yet been satisfactorily solved. Are we to conclude that such men  as Generals Hancock and Garfield, along with a great many more, had, and  have, no religion to be disturbed? Or is there a double portion of  sacrifice, the sacrifice of principle and liberty, demanded at the hands  of ministers of the Gospel of Christ? How is this? We are anxious to  know. Are the politicians of the country the voluntary scapegoats of the  nation, who risk their own salvation for political toil, which, from its  character, would, according to a very common opinion, kill out the  religion of all the saints in America? Surely we ought to feel grateful  to the political sinners who so willingly take all the risk of being  shut out of Paradise that they may have the exclusive right of  controlling the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28681"],[0,"The Cook's Oracle; and Housekeeper's Manual (#8)"],[1," most books of cookery, but _it is  my aim to blend the toothsome with the wholesome_; but, after all,  however the hale gourmand may at first differ from me in opinion, the  latter is the chief concern; since if he be even so entirely devoted to  the pleasure of eating as to think of no other, still the care of his  health becomes part of that; if he is sick he cannot relish his food.    \"The term _gourmand_, or EPICURE, has been strangely perverted; it has  been conceived synonymous with a glutton, '_ne pour la digestion_,' who  will eat as long as he can sit, and drink longer than he can stand, nor  leave his cup while he can lift it; or like the great eater of Kent whom  FULLER places among his worthies, and tells us that he did eat with ease  _thirty dozens of pigeons_ at one meal; at another, _fourscore rabbits_  and _eighteen yards of black pudding_, London measure!--or a fastidious  appetite, only to be excited by fantastic dainties, as the brains of  _peacocks_ or _parrots_, the tongues of _thrushes_ or _nightingales_, or  the teats of a lactiferous _sow_.    \"In the acceptation which I give to the term EPICURE, it means only the  person who has good sense and good taste enough to wish to have his food  cooked according to scientific principles; that is to say, so prepared  that the palate be not offended--that it be rendered easy of solution in  the stomach, and ultimately contribute to health; exciting him as an  animal to the vigorous enjoyment of those recreations and duties,  physical and intellectual, which constitute the happiness and dignity of  his nature.\" For this illustration I am indebted to my scientific friend  _Apicius Caelius, Jun._, with whose erudite observations several pages of  this work are enriched, to which I have affixed the signature _A.

A very spare and simple diet has commonly been recommended as  most conducive to health; but it would be more beneficial to mankind if  we could show them that a pleasant and varied diet was equally  consistent with health, as the very strict regimen of Arnard, or the  miller of Essex. These, and other abstemious people, who, having  experienced the greatest extremities of bad health, were driven to  temperance as their last resource, may run out in praises of a simple  diet; but the probability is, that nothing but the dread of former  sufferings could have given them the resolution to persevere in so  strict a course of abstinence, which persons who are in health and have  no such apprehension could not be induced to undertake, or, if they did,  would not long continue.    \"In all cases, great allowance must be made for the weakness of human  nature: the desires and appetites of mankind must, to a certain degree,  be gratified, and the man who wishes to be most useful will imitate the  indulgent parent, who, while he endeavours to promote the true interests  of his children, allows them the full enjoyment of all those innocent  pleasures which they take delight in. If it could be pointed out to  mankind that some articles used as food were hurtful, while others were  in their nature innocent, and that the latter were numerous, various,  and pleasant, they might, perhaps, be induced to forego those which were  hurtful, and confine themselves to those which were innocent.\"--_See_  Dr. STARK'S _Experiments on Diet_, pp. 89 and 90.

In consequence of these changes, the muscular fibre  becomes opaque, shorter, firmer, and drier; the tendons less opaque,  softer, and gluey; the fat is either melted out, or rendered  semi-transparent. Animal fluids become more transparent: the albumen is  coagulated and separated, and they dissolve gelatine and osmazome.    \"Lastly, and what is the most important change, and the immediate object  of all cookery, the meat loses the vapid nauseous smell and taste  peculiar to its raw state, and it becomes savoury and grateful.    \"Heat applied through the intervention of boiling oil, or melted fat, as  in FRYING, produces nearly the same changes; as the heat is sufficient  to evaporate the water, and to induce a degree of scorching.    \"But when water is the medium through which heat is applied--as in  BOILING, STEWING, and BAKING, the effects are somewhat different, as the  heat never exceeds 212 deg., which is not sufficient to commence the process  of browning or decomposition, and the soluble constituents are removed  by being dissolved in the water, forming soup or broth; or, if the  direct contact of the water be prevented, they are dissolved in the  juices of the meat, and separate in the form of gravy.\"    Vide Supplement to _Encyclop.
