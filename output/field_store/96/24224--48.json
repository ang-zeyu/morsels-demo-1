Of course these unions are almost inevitably miserable failures,  and one wonders what else the victims could have expected.       *   *   *    We now come to the third division, _Marriage for a Purpose_. These  matches are distantly allied with the partially-sordid, but there is  nothing sordid about them, as they are frequently undertaken from the  highest motives. In this class are the widowers who wed for the sake of  their children, the spinsters whose motive is their desire for  motherhood, the men and women who marry to possess a home, or for the  sake of companionship. All these reasons are justifiable enough, and  people who embark on matrimony with a set purpose generally take it very  seriously, and determine to make a success of it. Such marriages often  prove extremely happy, perhaps for the very reason that so little is  asked. The spirit of contentment is an excellent influence in married  life, since love is often killed by its own excessive demands, as I  shall endeavour to show later.       *   *   *    _Haphazard Marriages_ seem to me the best way to describe those unions  into which men drift without any special reason, sometimes almost  against their own wish. Nature does not care how the young people come  together as long as they do come, and sometimes a man finds himself  drifting into matrimony almost before he is aware. I write a 'man'  advisedly as women never _drift_ into wifehood. In these cases it is  generally their set and deliberate purpose that has steered the man into  the conjugal harbour unknown to him. He has merely followed the line of  least resistance and found to his surprise that it leads to the altar.  Mr Bernard Shaw has given a very amusing, and, in spite of itself,  convincing, picture of this manoeuvring in _Man and Superman_, where he  also expresses his conviction that 'men, to protect themselves . . .  have set up a feeble, romantic conviction that the initiative in sex  business must always come from the man . . . but the pretence is so  shallow, so unreal that even in the theatre, that last sanctuary of  unreality, it imposes only on the inexperienced. In Shakespeare's plays  the woman always takes the initiative. In his problem plays and his  popular plays alike the love interest is the interest of seeing the  woman hunt the man down. . . . The pretence that women do not take the  initiative is part of the farce. Why, the whole world is strewn with  snares, traps, gins, and pitfalls for the capture of men by women. It is  assumed that the woman must wait motionless to be wooed. Nay, she often  does wait motionless. That is how the spider waits for the fly. The  spider spins her web. And if the fly, like my hero, shows a strength  that promises to extricate him, how swiftly does she abandon her  pretence of passiveness, and openly fling coil after coil about him  until he is secured for ever!'       *   *   *    _The Marriage of Affection._--'Do you know any thoroughly happy  couples?' says one of the characters in _Double Harness_.    'Very hard to say. Oh, ecstasies aren't for this world, you know--not  permanent ecstasies. You might as well have permanent hysterics. And, as  you're aware, there are no marriages in heaven. So perhaps there's no  heaven in marriages either.'    These sentiments are of a nature to disgust and irritate the ignorant  girl of twenty by their callous unreality in her eyes, and to delight  the experienced woman of, say, thirty, by their profound truth in  hers--so utterly do one's ideas about life change in the course of ten  years or so!    Sixty years ago George Sand wrote: 'You ask me whether you will be happy  thro' love and marriage. You will not, I am fully convinced, be so in  either the one or the other. Love, fidelity, maternity are nevertheless  the most important, the most necessary things in the life of a woman.'    To the same effect writes R. L. Stevenson when he says: 'I suspect Love  is rather too violent a passion to make in all cases a good domestic  character.' Of course no very young people will believe this, but it is  a horrid sordid truth that, as a rule, the happiest marriages are those  in which the couple do not love too intensely. I am speaking of solid,  workaday happiness, not of ecstasies and raptures. The excessive claims  made by passionate love and the fevered state of mind it produces are  often the cause of its shipwreck. 'If I am horrid, darling,' a girl once  said to her lover, when trying to make up a quarrel she herself had  brought about, 'it's only because I love you so intensely.' 'Then, for  God's sake, love me less, and treat me better,' snapped the outraged  lover, and we can but sympathise with him.    I have purposely used the word _Affection_ in this division, in place of  one signifying a greater degree of feeling, and I unhesitatingly state  that generally speaking, the most successful marriages are those  which--'when the first sweet sting of love be past, the sweet that  almost venom is,' develop into the temperate, unexacting, peaceful and  harmonious unions which come under this heading. To the ardent youths  and maidens--restless seekers after the elusive joy of life--who will  have none of this prosaic and inglorious counsel, and who are prepared  to stake their all on the belief that the first sweet sting of love is  going to last for ever, I say: Get your roses-and-raptures over some  other way; don't look for romance in marriage or, unless your case prove  the exception to the rule, you will inevitably make a terrible  mistake! . . . Oh, don't ask _me_ how it is to be done, but remember  what I say, and don't marry until the quiet, sober, beautiful and  restful affection you now scorn becomes in your eyes a haven of peace  from the storm and stress of life, and the highest good it contains.    Another reason why the Marriage of Affection is the most likely to prove  a success is because mutual respect enters so largely into its  composition, and how enormously important this is in the holy estate,  none can realise until they marry. I shall have more to say later about  the urgent necessity for respect in married life.            II      WHY WE FALL OUT: DIVERS DISCORDS      'And yet when all has been said, the man who should hold back from    marriage is in the same case with him who runs away from battle.'      --R. L. STEVENSON.      We have discussed those types of marriage more or less doomed to failure  from the outset, and now come to the reason why so many matches prove  unhappy when apparently every circumstance has been favourable.    It was Socrates, I think, who said: 'Whether you marry or whether you  remain unmarried, you will repent it.' The people who assert that  marriage is a failure seem to lose sight of the fact that the estate was  not ordained for the purpose of happiness, but to meet the necessities  of society, and so long as these necessities are fulfilled by marriage,  then the institution must be pronounced successful, however unhappy  married people may be.    If the reasons 'why we fell out, my wife and I,' were to be considered  exhaustively, the subject would overflow the bounds of this modest  volume and run into several hundred giant tomes; indeed I believe an  entire library could be filled with books on this matter alone. Ever  since Adam and Eve had a few words over their dessert, husbands and  wives have gone on quarrelling continuously and the humble philosopher  who said that certain people quarrelled 'bitter and reg'lar, like man  and wife,' was merely describing a condition that habit had made  familiar to him.    As with the rest of life, in matrimony it is the little things that  count, and the frail barque of married happiness founders principally on  the insignificant, half-perceived rocks--the little jealousies, little  denials, little irritations, little tempers, little biting words, which  by degrees wear so many little holes in the stern that at last an  irreparable leak is sprung and the ship goes down in the next storm. The  big obstacles make a worse crash when they _do_ get in the way, but they  can be seen from afar and steered clear of.    A miserable husband who had come to the parting of the ways (having  started in the madly-in-love section), once confided in me that the  bitter and terrible quarrels between him and his wife always began for  some utterly trivial reason, generally because he did not admire her  clothes! Could anything be more pitifully absurd? 'Then why,' I asked,  'as you're so anxious to keep the peace, do you volunteer any criticism  at all?' 'Oh, I never do,' was the answer. 'She asks me my opinion of a  new gown, say, and gets angry when it's unfavourable. Then of course I  get angry too, I'm no saint, and presently we come to curses and words  that sting like blows. Then I clear out for a couple of days, and of  course there's the devil to pay when I go back, and it begins all over  again. Why, this present row has lasted five weeks or so, and in the  beginning it was simply because I said I didn't like the ostrich feather  in her hat!'    Again: I once met at a race-meeting a school-friend, long lost sight of,  whom I had last seen as a newly-wedded wife, loving and beloved. She was  now very much changed, hard and haggard of face. I asked after the man I  remembered as a radiant bridegroom.    'Oh, he's gone the way of all husbands,' she said, with a sigh; 'liver,  my dear.'    'Do you mean he's dead?' I asked, shocked and pained.    'Oh, dear, no, he's alive enough, but he's developed liver and that's  killed our love,' was the cynical reply.    It had. Devotion and dyspepsia are hard to reconcile and my friend's  husband had developed a nasty knack of throwing his dinner in the fire  whenever it displeased him, a habit hardly conducive to home happiness.

CELERY SALAD    Scrape and wash the tender hearts of crisp celery, cut in one-inch  pieces; cut pieces in straws lengthwise; there should be two cups. Add  one cup blanched and shredded almonds, mix well and marinate with French  Dressing and let stand one hour. Drain and arrange in nests of heart  lettuce leaves, sprinkle with the rings of Spanish onion thinly sliced  (using the heart rings). Mask with Mayonnaise or with Boiled Salad  Dressing.      SQUASH PIE (ECONOMICAL)    Bake the half of a Hubbard squash, scoop out the pulp, rub through a  strainer. (There should be one and one-half cups.) Add one cup hot milk,  one-half cup sugar, one-half teaspoon salt, one-half teaspoon ginger,  one-fourth teaspoon nutmeg and one egg well beaten. Mix well. Line a pie  pan with Plain Paste, put an extra rim of pastry around edge of pie,  flute rim and turn in mixture. Bake thirty minutes in a moderately hot  oven.

Bit of bay leaf.            4 cloves.            1/2 teaspoon peppercorns.            Few gratings nutmeg.            3 tablespoons butter.            2 tablespoons flour.            Salt, pepper, cayenne.    PROCESS: Cook the first six ingredients together twenty minutes. Rub  through a puree strainer, keep hot. Melt butter in a sauce-pan, add  flour and stir to a smooth paste, let cook one minute; dilute with  tomato mixture to the consistency to pour. Combine mixtures and season  with salt, a few grains cayenne and a grating of nutmeg. Reheat and  serve with crisp, toasted Saratoga Wafers.      ROAST GUINEA FOWL    Clean, singe, draw and truss in the same way as for roasting chicken.  Stuff if desired. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay very thin slices of  fat salt pork over the breast, wings and legs. Place in a covered  roasting pan, pour in one-half cup water, set in oven and roast from  forty-five minutes to one hour (continue cooking if liked well done),  turning so as to brown evenly. (When the roasting pan is used there need  be no basting.) If roasted in an open dripping-pan, baste every ten to  fifteen minutes. The flesh of this bird is dry and is therefore best  cooked rare. Serve as roast chicken. Prepare sauce same as Giblet Sauce.  (See Page 154.)      RHUBARB SAUCE    The young, tender stalks of rhubarb need only be washed, tops and root  cut off, then cut in one-inch pieces (without peeling). Put in a  sauce-pan, add just enough water to prevent burning. Cook slowly until  soft. Add sugar to sweeten to taste, cook five minutes, cool and turn  into serving dish.      POTATO SOUFFLES    Select six medium-sized, rather flat potatoes. Wash, pare and trim them  square, then cut lengthwise in slices one-eighth of an inch thick (no  thicker). Wash and dry them on a towel. Drop a few at a time into hot  Cottolene (not smoking hot), fry them four minutes, turning them  occasionally. Remove with skimmer to a croquette basket, let stand five  minutes while the fat is heating. When hot enough to brown an inch cube  of bread in forty seconds, place the basket containing potatoes into  fat, shake constantly and fry two minutes. Drain on brown paper. Repeat  process until all potatoes are used. Sprinkle with salt and dispose  around roasted Guinea Fowl.      EGG-PLANT SAUTE (WITH FINE HERBS)    Pare a medium-sized egg-plant, cut in very thin slices, sprinkle with  salt and pile in a colander. Cover with a plate and weights to press out  the acrid juice; let stand two hours, sprinkle with pepper, dredge with  flour, and saute in hot butter until crisp and a golden brown. Mix  together one-half teaspoon each finely chopped parsley and chives,  one-fourth teaspoon very finely chopped chervil and sprinkle lightly  over egg-plant as soon as crisp. Arrange on hot serving dish and serve  at once.      DRESSED HEAD LETTUCE    Remove the outer green leaves from two medium-sized heads of crisp head  lettuce. Wash carefully, without separating the leaves; drain dry in a  wire basket or on towels. Cut heads in halves lengthwise and arrange in  salad bowl. Set aside in a cool place, and, just before serving, pour  over French Dressing. Serve at once.      ORANGE ICE              4 cups water.            2-1/2 cups sugar.            2 cups orange juice.            1/2 cup lemon juice.            Rind of two oranges.    PROCESS: Pare the rind as thinly as possible from two oranges; add to  water and sugar, and cook twenty minutes. Remove rind, add fruit juice,  strain, cool and freeze. Serve in stem glasses.      CHOCOLATE JUMBLES              1/3 cup Cottolene.            1 cup sugar.            2 squares chocolate grated.            1 tablespoon milk or water.            2 eggs beaten thick and light.            2 teaspoons baking powder.            2 cups flour.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            1 teaspoon vanilla.    PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly, add  chocolate, milk and eggs. Mix and sift flour, baking powder and salt;  add to first mixture. Add more flour if necessary. Dough should be soft.  Toss on a floured board, roll out to one-half inch thickness, shape with  a doughnut cutter, sprinkle with granulated sugar and bake ten to twelve  minutes in a hot oven.          _March_                _What and how great the virtue and the art             To live on little with a cheerful heart._                                              --_Pope._    [Illustration]    [Sidenote: _March_    _First Sunday_]          Menu              SPRING SOUP--CRUSTS              BREAST OF VEAL ROASTED--BROWN SAUCE              SPANISH RICE      MASHED PARSNIPS              PINEAPPLE FRITTERS              RED CABBAGE, CELERY AND ONION SALAD              STEAMED CURRANT PUDDING              DRIED APRICOT AND HARD SAUCE              SMALL CUPS COFFEE           *       *       *       *       *    SPRING SOUP              3 bunches chopped watercress.            1 bunch young onions.            3 tablespoons butter.            2 tablespoons flour.            1/2 cup thin cream.

Cook watercress and onions in butter five minutes (without  browning), add flour and salt, stir until smooth, then pour milk on  gradually, stirring constantly. Cook over hot water twenty minutes. Add  beef extract, stir until dissolved; season with Worcestershire sauce and  a few grains cayenne. Strain into hot soup tureen, add whipped cream and  sprinkle with finely chopped parsley.      CRUSTS    Cut stale sandwich bread lengthwise in one-inch thick slices and remove  crusts. Cut slices in bars one inch wide and six inches long. Bake in a  hot oven until delicately browned. Turn them so that crusts may brown  evenly on all sides. Serve hot and crisp.      BREAST OF VEAL ROASTED    Six pounds of veal cut from the breast. Wipe, and skewer meat into  shape, sprinkle with salt, pepper, dredge with flour and cover top with  thin slices of fat salt pork. Lay in a dripping pan and strew cubes of  pork around meat. Place in a very hot oven for the first half hour,  basting every ten minutes with fat in pan, then reduce heat and cook  meat slowly until tender, allowing twenty minutes to pound; continue  basting. The last half hour of cooking remove salt pork, dredge meat  again with flour, and brown richly. Remove meat to hot serving platter,  surround with Spanish Rice and prepare a Brown Sauce from some of the  fat in pan. (See Page 82 for Brown Sauce.)      SPANISH RICE    Cover one cup of rice with cold water; heat to boiling point and boil  two minutes. Drain in a strainer, rinse well with cold water and drain  again. Cut four slices of bacon in shreds, crosswise, and cook until  crisp. Remove bacon, add to rice. Cut one-half of a green or red pepper  in shreds and cook in bacon fat until soft, then add pepper and bacon  fat to rice. Cover with three cups of well-seasoned chicken broth,  season well with salt, cover and let cook until rice has absorbed broth  and is tender, then add one cup of thick tomato puree and two-thirds cup  of grated cheese. Mix well with a fork and let heat through over boiling  water. Serve with roast veal or breaded veal cutlets.      MASHED PARSNIPS    Wash and cook in boiling water, drain and plunge into cold water, when  the skins may be easily rubbed off. Mash and rub through a sieve. Season  with salt, pepper, butter and moisten with a little cream or milk.  Reheat over hot water and serve.      PINEAPPLE FRITTERS    Drain sliced pineapple from the liquor in the can. Dry on a crash towel.  Dip in batter and fry a golden brown in deep hot Cottolene. Drain on  brown paper, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with some of the  liquor from which it was drained. This may be slightly thickened with  arrowroot, allowing one teaspoon arrowroot to each cup of liquor.    BATTER FOR FRITTERS              1 cup bread flour.            1 tablespoon sugar.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            2/3 cup milk.            1/2 teaspoon melted Cottolene.
