He spoke eagerly to the Abenaquais in their own  tongue, which was unintelligible to the Hurons. When he had listened  to a few words of their explanation, he ran hastily to the lady,  kissed her, called her by name, 'Caroline!' She woke up suddenly, and  recognizing the Intendant, embraced him, crying 'Francois! 'Francois!'  and fainted in his arms.    \"The Chevalier was profoundly agitated, blessing and banning, in the  same breath, the fortune that had led her to him. He gave her wine,  restored her to consciousness, talked with her long, and sometimes  angrily; but to no avail, for the woman, in accents of despair,  exclaimed in French, which the Hurons understood, that the Intendant  might kill and bury her there, but she would never, never return home  any more.\"    Angelique scarcely took breath as she continued her eager recital.    \"The Intendant, overpowered either by love of her or fear of her, ceased  his remonstrances. He gave some pieces of gold to the Abenaquais, and  dismissed them. The strange Indians kissed her on both hands as they  would a queen, and with many adieus vanished into the forest. The lady,  attended by Bigot, remained seated under the tree till nightfall, when  he conducted her secretly to the Chateau, where she still remains in  perfect seclusion in a secret chamber, they say, and has been seen by  none save one or two of the Intendant's most intimate companions.\"    \"Heavens! what a tale of romance! How learned you all this, Angelique?\"  exclaimed Amelie, who had listened with breathless attention to the  narrative.    \"Oh, partly from a hint from a Huron girl, and the rest from the  Intendant's Secretary. Men cannot keep secrets that women are interested  in knowing! I could make De Pean talk the Intendant's head off his  shoulders, if I had him an hour in my confessional. But all my ingenuity  could not extract from him what he did not know--who that mysterious  lady is, her name and family.\"    \"Could the Huron hunters give no guess?\" asked Amelie, thoroughly  interested in Angelique's story.    \"No. They learned by signs, however, from the Abenaquais, that she was  a lady of a noble family in Acadia which had mingled its patrician  blood with that of the native chiefs and possessors of the soil. The  Abenaquais were chary of their information, however: they would only say  she was a great white lady, and as good as any saint in the calendar.\"    \"I would give five years of my life to know who and what that woman is!\"  Angelique added, as she leaned over the parapet, gazing intently at the  great forest that lay beyond Charlebourg, in which was concealed the  Chateau of Beaumanoir.    \"It is a strange mystery. But I would not seek to unravel it,  Angelique,\" remarked Amelie, \"I feel there is sin in it. Do not touch  it: it will only bring mischief upon you if you do!\"    \"Mischief! So be it! But I will know the worst! The Intendant is  deceiving me! Woe be to him and her if I am to be their intended victim!  Will you not assist me, Amelie, to discover the truth of this secret?\"    \"I? how can I? I pity you, Angelique, but it were better to leave this  Intendant to his own devices.\"    \"You can very easily help me if you will. Le Gardeur must know  this secret. He must have seen the woman--but he is angry with me,  for--for--slighting him--as he thinks--but he was wrong. I could not  avow to him my jealousy in this matter. He told me just enough to  madden me, and angrily refused to tell the rest when he saw me so  infatuated--he called it--over other people's love affairs. Oh, Amelie,  Le Gardeur will tell you all if you ask him!\"    \"And I repeat it to you, Angelique, I cannot question Le Gardeur on such  a hateful topic. At any rate I need time to reflect, and will pray to be  guided right.\"    \"Oh, pray not at all! If you pray you will never aid me! I know you  will say the end is wicked and the means dishonorable. But find out I  will--and speedily! It will only be the price of another dance with the  Chevalier de Pean, to discover all I want. What fools men are when they  believe we love them for their sakes and not for our own!\"    Amelie, pitying the wild humors, as she regarded them, of her old school  companion, took her arm to walk to and fro in the bastion, but was not  sorry to see her aunt and the Bishop and Father de Berey approaching.    \"Quick,\" said she to Angelique, \"smooth your hair, and compose your  looks. Here comes my aunt and the Bishop--Father de Berey too!\"    Angelique prepared at once to meet them, and with her wonderful power  of adaptation transformed herself in a moment into a merry creature, all  light and gaiety. She saluted the Lady de Tilly and the reverend Bishop  in the frankest manner, and at once accepted an interchange of wit and  laughter with Father de Berey.    \"She could not remain long, however, in the Church's company,\" she said,  \"she had her morning calls to finish.\" She kissed the cheek of Amelie  and the hand of the Lady de Tilly, and with a coquettish courtesy to the  gentlemen, leaped nimbly into her caleche, whirled round her spirited  horses like a practised charioteer, and drove with rapid pace down  the crowded street of St. John, the observed of all observers, the  admiration of the men and the envy of the women as she flashed by.    Amelie and the Lady de Tilly, having seen a plenteous meal distributed  among their people, proceeded to their city home--their seigniorial  residence, when they chose to live in the capital.        CHAPTER V. THE ITINERANT NOTARY.      Master Jean Le Nocher the sturdy ferryman's patience had been severely  tried for a few days back, passing the troops of habitans over the St.  Charles to the city of Quebec. Being on the King's corvee, they claimed  the privilege of all persons in the royal service: they travelled  toll-free, and paid Jean with a nod or a jest in place of the small coin  which that worthy used to exact on ordinary occasions.    This morning had begun auspiciously for Jean's temper however. A King's  officer, on a gray charger, had just crossed the ferry; and without  claiming the exemption from toll which was the right of all wearing the  King's uniform, the officer had paid Jean more than his fee in solid  coin and rode on his way, after a few kind words to the ferryman and a  polite salute to his wife Babet, who stood courtesying at the door of  their cottage.    \"A noble gentleman that, and a real one!\" exclaimed Jean, to his buxom,  pretty wife, \"and as generous as a prince! See what he has given me.\"  Jean flipped up a piece of silver admiringly, and then threw it into the  apron of Babet, which she spread out to catch it.    Babet rubbed the silver piece caressingly between her fingers and upon  her cheek. \"It is easy to see that handsome officer is from the Castle,\"  said Babet, \"and not from the Palace--and so nice-looking he is too,  with such a sparkle in his eye and a pleasant smile on his mouth. He is  as good as he looks, or I am no judge of men.\"    \"And you are an excellent judge of men, I know, Babet,\" he replied, \"or  you would never have taken me!\" Jean chuckled richly over his own  wit, which Babet nodded lively approval to. \"Yes, I know a hawk from a  handsaw,\" replied Babet, \"and a woman who is as wise as that will never  mistake a gentleman, Jean! I have not seen a handsomer officer than that  in seven years!\"    \"He is a pretty fellow enough, I dare say, Babet; who can he be? He  rides like a field-marshal too, and that gray horse has ginger in his  heels!\" remarked Jean, as the officer was riding at a rapid gallop up  the long, white road of Charlebourg. \"He is going to Beaumanoir, belike,  to see the Royal Intendant, who has not returned yet from his hunting  party.\"    \"Whither they went three days ago, to enjoy themselves in the chase and  drink themselves blind in the Chateau while everybody else is summoned  to the city to work upon the walls!\" replied Babet, scornfully. \"I'll  be bound that officer has gone to order the gay gallants of the Friponne  back to the city to take their share of work with honest people.\"    \"Ah! the Friponne! The Friponne!\" ejaculated Jean. \"The foul fiend fly  away with the Friponne! My ferryboat is laden every day with the curses  of the habitans returning from the Friponne, where they cheat worse than  a Basque pedler, and without a grain of his politeness!\"    The Friponne, as it was styled in popular parlance, was the immense  magazine established by the Grand Company of Traders in New France. It  claimed a monopoly in the purchase and sale of all imports and exports  in the Colony. Its privileges were based upon royal ordinances and  decrees of the Intendant, and its rights enforced in the most arbitrary  manner--and to the prejudice of every other mercantile interest in the  Colony. As a natural consequence it was cordially hated, and richly  deserved the maledictions which generally accompanied the mention of  the Friponne--the swindle--a rough and ready epithet which sufficiently  indicated the feeling of the people whom it at once cheated and  oppressed.    \"They say, Jean,\" continued Babet, her mind running in a very practical  and womanly way upon the price of commodities and good bargains, \"they  say, Jean, that the Bourgeois Philibert will not give in like the other  merchants. He sets the Intendant at defiance, and continues to buy  and sell in his own comptoir as he has always done, in spite of the  Friponne.\"    \"Yes, Babet! that is what they say. But I would rather he stood in his  own shoes than I in them if he is to fight this Intendant--who is a  Tartar, they say.\"    \"Pshaw, Jean! you have less courage than a woman. All the women are on  the side of the good Bourgeois: he is an honest merchant--sells cheap,  and cheats nobody!\" Babet looked down very complacently upon her new  gown, which had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#8)"],[1,"knees. They had  killed that morning a good quarry, enough for all, a deer that had been  wounded by hunting dogs; so that there had been no quarrelling among  them, and some of the women were still gnawing the bones that lay  scattered about. Others were making a heap of leaves and sticks to feed  Brother Fire when the darkness came again, that he might grow strong and  tall therewith, and guard them against the beasts. And two were piling  flints that they brought, an armful at a time, from the bend of the  river where the children were at play.    None of these buff-skinned savages were clothed, but some wore about  their hips rude girdles of adder-skin or crackling undressed hide, from  which depended little bags, not made, but torn from the paws of beasts,  and carrying the rudely-dressed flints that were men's chief weapons and  tools. And one woman, the mate of Uya the Cunning Man, wore a wonderful  necklace of perforated fossils--that others had worn before her. Beside  some of the sleeping men lay the big antlers of the elk, with the tines  chipped to sharp edges, and long sticks, hacked at the ends with flints  into sharp points. There was little else save these things and the  smouldering fire to mark these human beings off from the wild animals  that ranged the country. But Uya the Cunning did not sleep, but sat with  a bone in his hand and scraped busily thereon with a flint, a thing no  animal would do. He was the oldest man in the tribe, beetle-browed,  prognathous, lank-armed; he had a beard and his cheeks were hairy, and  his chest and arms were black with thick hair. And by virtue both of his  strength and cunning he was master of the tribe, and his share was  always the most and the best.    Eudena had hidden herself among the alders, because she was afraid of  Uya. She was still a girl, and her eyes were bright and her smile  pleasant to see. He had given her a piece of the liver, a man's piece,  and a wonderful treat for a girl to get; but as she took it the other  woman with the necklace had looked at her, an evil glance, and Ugh-lomi  had made a noise in his throat. At that, Uya had looked at him long and  steadfastly, and Ugh-lomi's face had fallen. And then Uya had looked at  her. She was frightened and she had stolen away, while the feeding was  still going on, and Uya was busy with the marrow of a bone. Afterwards  he had wandered about as if looking for her. And now she crouched among  the alders, wondering mightily what Uya might be doing with the flint  and the bone. And Ugh-lomi was not to be seen.    Presently a squirrel came leaping through the alders, and she lay so  quiet the little man was within six feet of her before he saw her.  Whereupon he dashed up a stem in a hurry and began to chatter and scold  her. \"What are you doing here,\" he asked, \"away from the other men  beasts?\" \"Peace,\" said Eudena, but he only chattered more, and then she  began to break off the little black cones to throw at him. He dodged and  defied her, and she grew excited and rose up to throw better, and then  she saw Uya coming down the knoll. He had seen the movement of her pale  arm amidst the thicket--he was very keen-eyed.    At that she forgot the squirrel and set off through the alders and reeds  as fast as she could go. She did not care where she went so long as she  escaped Uya. She splashed nearly knee-deep through a swampy place, and  saw in front of her a slope of ferns--growing more slender and green as  they passed up out of the light into the shade of the young chestnuts.  She was soon amidst the trees--she was very fleet of foot, and she ran  on and on until the forest was old and the vales great, and the vines  about their stems where the light came were thick as young trees, and  the ropes of ivy stout and tight. On she went, and she doubled and  doubled again, and then at last lay down amidst some ferns in a hollow  place near a thicket, and listened with her heart beating in her ears.    She heard footsteps presently rustling among the dead leaves, far off,  and they died away and everything was still again, except the  scandalising of the midges--for the evening was drawing on--and the  incessant whisper of the leaves. She laughed silently to think the  cunning Uya should go by her. She was not frightened. Sometimes, playing  with the other girls and lads, she had fled into the wood, though never  so far as this. It was pleasant to be hidden and alone.    She lay a long time there, glad of her escape, and then she sat up  listening.    It was a rapid pattering growing louder and coming towards her, and in a  little while she could hear grunting noises and the snapping of twigs.  It was a drove of lean grisly wild swine. She turned about her, for a  boar is an ill fellow to pass too closely, on account of the sideway  slash of his tusks, and she made off slantingly through the trees. But  the patter came nearer, they were not feeding as they wandered, but  going fast--or else they would not overtake her--and she caught the limb  of a tree, swung on to it, and ran up the stem with something of the  agility of a monkey.    Down below the sharp bristling backs of the swine were already passing  when she looked. And she knew the short, sharp grunts they made meant  fear. What were they afraid of? A man? They were in a great hurry for  just a man.    And then, so suddenly it made her grip on the branch tighten  involuntarily, a fawn started in the brake and rushed after the swine.  Something else went by, low and grey, with a long body; she did not know  what it was, indeed she saw it only momentarily through the interstices  of the young leaves; and then there came a pause.    She remained stiff and expectant, as rigid almost as though she was a  part of the tree she clung to, peering down.    Then, far away among the trees, clear for a moment, then hidden, then  visible knee-deep in ferns, then gone again, ran a man. She knew it was  young Ugh-lomi by the fair colour of his hair, and there was red upon  his face. Somehow his frantic flight and that scarlet mark made her feel  sick. And then nearer, running heavily and breathing hard, came another  man. At first she could not see, and then she saw, foreshortened and  clear to her, Uya, running with great strides and his eyes staring. He  was not going after Ugh-lomi. His face was white. It was Uya--_afraid_!  He passed, and was still loud hearing, when something else, something  large and with grizzled fur, swinging along with soft swift strides,  came rushing in pursuit of him.    Eudena suddenly became rigid, ceased to breathe, her clutch convulsive,  and her eyes starting.    She had never seen the thing before, she did not even see him clearly  now, but she knew at once it was the Terror of the Woodshade. His name  was a legend, the children would frighten one another, frighten even  themselves with his name, and run screaming to the squatting-place. No  man had ever killed any of his kind. Even the mighty mammoth feared his  anger. It was the grizzly bear, the lord of the world as the world went  then.    As he ran he made a continuous growling grumble. \"Men in my very lair!  Fighting and blood. At the very mouth of my lair. Men, men, men.  Fighting and blood.\" For he was the lord of the wood and of the caves.    Long after he had passed she remained, a girl of stone, staring down  through the branches. All her power of action had gone from her. She  gripped by instinct with hands and knees and feet. It was some time  before she could think, and then only one thing was clear in her mind,  that the Terror was between her and the tribe--that it would be  impossible to descend.    Presently when her fear was a little abated she clambered into a more  comfortable position, where a great branch forked. The trees rose about  her, so that she could see nothing of Brother Fire, who is black by day.  Birds began to stir, and things that had gone into hiding for fear of  her movements crept out....    After a time the taller branches flamed out at the touch of the sunset.  High overhead the rooks, who were wiser than men, went cawing home to  their squatting-places among the elms. Looking down, things were clearer  and darker. Eudena thought of going back to the squatting-place; she let  herself down some way, and then the fear of the Terror of the Woodshade  came again. While she hesitated a rabbit squealed dismally, and she  dared not descend farther.    The shadows gathered, and the deeps of the forest began stirring. Eudena  went up the tree again to be nearer the light. Down below the shadows  came out of their hiding-places and walked abroad. Overhead the blue  deepened. A dreadful stillness came, and then the leaves began  whispering.    Eudena shivered and thought of Brother Fire.    The shadows now were gathering in the trees, they sat on the branches  and watched her. Branches and leaves were turned to ominous, quiet black  shapes that would spring on her if she stirred. Then the white owl,  flitting silently, came ghostly through the shades. Darker grew the  world and darker, until the leaves and twigs against the sky were black,  and the ground was hidden.    She remained there all night, an age-long vigil, straining her ears for  the things that went on below in the darkness, and keeping motionless  lest some stealthy beast should discover her. Man in those days was  never alone in the dark, save for such rare accidents as this. Age after  age he had learnt the lesson of its terror--a lesson we poor children of  his have nowadays painfully to unlearn. Eudena, though in age a woman,  was in heart like a little child. She kept as still, poor little animal,  as a hare before it is started.    The stars gathered and watched her--her one grain of comfort. In one  bright one she fancied there was something like Ugh-lomi. Then she  fancied it _was_ Ugh-lomi. And near him, red and duller, was Uya, and as  the night passed Ugh-lom"]]]
