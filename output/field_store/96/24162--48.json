Foremost among astronomers of less conspicuous eminence who made  important discoveries in this century we find the name of Huygens.    CHRISTIAN HUYGENS was born at The Hague in 1629. He was the second son  of Constantine Huygens, an eminent diplomatist, and secretary to the  Prince of Orange. Huygens studied at Leyden and Breda, and became  highly distinguished as a geometrician and scientist. He made important  investigations relative to the figure of the Earth, and wrote a learned  treatise on the cause of gravity; he also determined with greater  accuracy investigations made by Galileo regarding the accelerated motion  of bodies when subjected to the influence of that force.    Huygens admitted that the planets and their satellites attracted each  other with a force varying according to the inverse ratio of the squares  of their distances, but rejected the mutual attraction of the molecules  of matter, believing that they possessed gravity towards a central point  only, to which they were attracted. This supposition was at variance  with the Newtonian theory, which, however, was universally regarded as  the correct one.    Huygens originated the theory by which it is believed that light is  produced by the undulatory vibration of the ether; he also discovered  polarization.    Up to this time the method adopted in the construction of clocks was not  capable of producing a mechanism which measured time with sufficient  accuracy to satisfy the requirements of astronomers. Huygens endeavoured  to supply this want, and applied his mechanical ingenuity in  constructing a clock that could be relied upon to keep accurate time.  Though the pendulum motion was first adopted by Galileo, he was unable  to arrange its mechanism so that it should keep up a continuous  movement. The oscillation of the pendulum ceased after a time, and a  fresh impulse had to be applied to set it in motion. Consequently,  Galileo's clock was of no service as a timekeeper.    Huygens overcame this difficulty by so arranging the mechanism of his  clock that the balance, instead of being horizontal, was directed  perpendicularly, and prolonged downwards to form a pendulum, the  oscillations of which regulated the downward motion of the weight. This  invention, which was highly applauded, proved to be of great service  everywhere, and was especially valuable for astronomical purposes.    Huygens next directed his attention to the construction of telescopes,  and displayed much skill in the grinding and polishing of lenses. He  made several instruments superior in power and accuracy to any that  existed previously, and with one of these made some remarkable  discoveries when observing the planet Saturn.    The telescopic appearance of Saturn is one of the most beautiful in the  heavens. The planet, surrounded by two brilliant rings, and accompanied  by eight attendant moons, surpasses all the other orbs of the firmament  as an object of interest and admiration. To the naked eye, Saturn is  visible as a star of the first magnitude, and was known to the ancients  as the most remote of the planets. Travelling in space at a distance of  nearly one thousand millions of miles from the Sun, the planet  accomplishes a revolution of its mighty orbit in twenty-nine and a half  years.    Galileo was the first astronomer who directed a telescope to Saturn. He  observed that the planet presented a triform appearance, and that on  each side of the central globe there were two objects, in close contact  with it, which caused it to assume an ovoid shape. After further  observation, Galileo perceived that the lateral bodies gradually  decreased in size, until they became invisible. At the expiration of a  certain period of time they reappeared, and were observed to go through  a certain cycle of changes. By the application of increased telescopic  power it was discovered that the appendages were not of a rounded form,  but appeared as two small crescents, having their concave surfaces  directed towards the planet and their extremities in contact with it,  resembling the manner in which the handles are attached to a cup.    These objects were observed to go through a series of periodic changes.  After having become invisible, they reappeared as two luminous straight  bands, projecting from each side of the planet; during the next seven or  eight years they gradually opened out, and assumed a crescentic form;  they afterwards began to contract, and on the expiration of a similar  period, during which time they gradually decreased in size, they again  became invisible. It was perceived that the appendages completed a cycle  of their changes in about fifteen years.    In 1656, Huygens, with a telescope constructed by himself, was enabled  to solve the enigma which for so many years baffled the efforts of the  ablest astronomers. He announced his discovery in the form of a Latin  cryptograph which, when deciphered, read as follows:--    'Annulo cingitur, tenui plano, nusquam cohaerente, ad eclipticam  inclinatio.'    'The planet is surrounded by a slender flat ring everywhere distinct  from its surface, and inclined to the ecliptic.'    Huygens perceived the shadow of the ring thrown on the planet, and was  able to account in a satisfactory manner for all the phenomena observed  in connection with its variable appearance.    The true form of the ring is circular, but by us it is seen  foreshortened; consequently, when the Earth is above or below its plane,  it appears of an elliptical shape. When the position of the planet is  such that the plane of the ring passes through the Sun, the edge of the  ring only is illumined, and then it becomes invisible for a short  period. In the same manner, when the plane of the ring passes through  the Earth, the illumined edge of the ring is not of sufficient magnitude  to appear visible, but as the enlightened side of the plane becomes more  inclined towards the Earth, the ring comes again into view. When the  plane of the ring passes between the Earth and the Sun, the unillumined  side of the ring is turned towards the Earth, and during the time it  remains in this position it is invisible.    Huygens discovered the sixth satellite of Saturn (Titan), and also the  Great Nebula in Orion.    JOHANN HEVELIUS, a celebrated Prussian astronomer, was born at Dantzig  in 1611, and died in that city in 1687. He was a man of wealth, and  erected an observatory at his residence, where, for a period of forty  years, he carried out a series of astronomical observations.    He constructed a chart of the stars, and in order to complete his work,  formed nine new constellations in those spaces in the celestial vault  which were previously un-named. They are known by the names  Camelopardus, Canes Venatici, Coma Bernices, Lacerta, Leo Minor, Lynx,  Monoceros, Sextans, and Vulpecula. He also executed a chart of the  Moon's surface, wrote a description of the lunar spots, and discovered  the Libration of the Moon in Longitude.    On May 30, 1661, Hevelius observed a transit of Mercury, a description  of which he published, and included with it Horrox's treatise on the  first-recorded transit of Venus. This work, after having passed through  several hands, became the property of Hevelius, who was capable of  appreciating its merits. The manuscript was sent to him by Huygens, and  in acknowledging it he writes: 'How greatly does my Mercury exult in the  joyous prospect that he may shortly fold within his arms Horrox's long  looked-for and beloved Venus! He renders you unfeigned thanks that by  your permission this much-desired union is about to be celebrated, and  that the writer is able, with your concurrence, to introduce them both  together to the public.'    Hevelius made numerous researches on comets, and suggested that the  form of their paths might be a parabola.    GIOVANNI DOMENICO CASSINI was born at Perinaldo, near Nice, in 1625. He  studied at Genoa and Bologna, and was afterwards appointed to the Chair  of Astronomy at the latter University. He was a man of high scientific  attainments, and made many important astronomical discoveries.    In 1671 he became Director of the Royal Observatory at Paris, and  devoted a long life to trying and difficult observations, which in his  later years deprived him of his eyesight.    In 1644 Cassini proved beyond doubt that Jupiter rotated on his axis,  and also assigned his period of rotation with considerable accuracy. He  published tables of the planet's satellites, and determined their  motions from observations of their eclipses. He ascertained the periods  of rotation of Venus and Mars; executed a chart of the lunar surface,  and observed an occultation of Jupiter by the Moon.    Cassini discovered the dual nature of Saturn's ring, having perceived  that instead of one there are two concentric rings separated by a dark  space. He also discovered four of the planet's satellites--viz. Japetus,  Rhea, Dione, and Tethys. He made a near approximation to the solar  parallax by means of researches on the parallax of Mars, and  investigated some irregularities of the Moon's motion. Cassini  discovered the belts of Jupiter, and also the Zodiacal Light, and  established the coincidence of the nodes of the lunar equator and orbit.    JAQUES CASSINI, son of Giovanni, was born at Paris in 1677. He followed  in his father's footsteps, and wrote several treatises on astronomical  subjects. He investigated the period of the rotation of Venus on her  axis, and upheld the results arrived at by his father, which were  afterwards confirmed by observations made by Schroeter. Cassini made  some valuable researches with regard to the proper motion of the stars,  and demonstrated that their change of position on the celestial vault  was real, and not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#8)"],[1,"accustom ourselves  to many things that are not absolutely healthful, but this should not  make us willing to live unhealthfully when it is possible to avoid  it.          CHAPTER VII.    ADDED INJURIES FROM TIGHT CLOTHING.      We have talked of the effect of tight clothing upon the breathing  power. Let us see what other injuries arise from wearing the dress too  tight. In the first place, the action of the heart is impeded. The  heart is a hollow muscle which must be continually filled with blood  and emptied again many times a minute from the moment of birth till  the moment of death. You have been lying down for an hour; let me  count your pulse. Now sit up for a few moments. I find, now, that it  beats faster. Now stand up, and it beats still faster. You see, it  increases continually as you get into the erect position. Now walk  quickly across the floor and you will see how much it has increased  again in rapidity.    You will realize how much the dress interferes with the action of the  heart better from an illustration. Professor Sargent made an  experiment with a number of girls. One day they were dressed in  perfectly loose clothing. He counted the pulse of each. It beat on the  average of eighty-four times in a minute. He had them run five hundred  and forty yards in the space of two and a half minutes. The pulse was  again counted. It had increased to one hundred and fifty-six beats in  a minute. This illustrates the effect of exercise even in loose  clothing. The next day at the same time, dressed with a corset which  reduced the waist to twenty-four inches, they ran the same distance in  the same length of time, and then he found that the pulse had run up  to one hundred and sixty-eight beats in a minute, showing how much  harder it was for the heart to do its work when restricted by tight  clothing. No acrobat would attempt to perform feats of strength or of  agility if restricted even so much as by a belt.    The Russian Government has issued an edict that the soldiers must wear  their pantaloons held up by suspenders, for it has been demonstrated  that when they wear them supported by a belt around the waist they are  not able to do a fair amount of work. The Austrian Government has also  decreed that the pantaloons of soldiers are not to be suspended by  belts because of the increase of kidney difficulty caused thereby.    We will understand why kidney difficulty is caused by tight clothing  when we study the location of the kidneys and how they are affected by  compression of the ribs. Most people think the kidneys lie low down in  the back, but in reality they lie up under the short ribs, and the  pressure of tight clothing brings the ribs to bear directly upon the  kidneys, injuring them in such a way as often to cause disease.    The heart and lungs are protected by a bony framework called the  thorax, but below the thorax there is no protection for the internal  organs except that of the muscles, therefore the corset or tight  clothing can do most damage to the vital organs below the diaphragm.  The largest of these is the liver. It should lie close up under the  diaphragm, from which it is suspended. Under the influence of tight  clothing it is often pressed over on the right side, sometimes  extending over the whole front of the body, or even as low down as the  navel. It is rutted by the pressure of the ribs. The corset liver is  well known in the dissecting-room. Sometimes, where corsets are not  worn and tight skirts are worn, supported by the hips, the liver has  almost been cut in two, the pieces being only held together by a  sufficient band of tissue to keep them from dying.    When Hiram Powers, the great sculptor, was in this country, he once  attended an elegant party, and was observed watching very intently a  beautifully dressed, fashionable woman. A friend, noticing his  interest, said to him, \"What an elegant figure she has, hasn't she?\"    \"Well,\" said Powers, \"I was wondering where she put her liver.\"    You see, Powers had studied the human body, and when he saw such an  outline as the figure of a fashionable woman, he knew that some  internal organ must be displaced in order to create that tapering  waist, and his anxiety was for the internal organs. As an artist he  did not admire the tapering waist, as is shown by the beautiful marble  statue which he made. No artist would perpetuate in marble the figure  of the fashionable woman.    Not only is the liver thus displaced, but the stomach is often pressed  out of its original position, which should be also close up under the  diaphragm, towards the left side. By the pressure of clothing it is  sometimes pushed down until it lies in the abdominal cavity, even as  low down as the navel. This is the statement of Dr. J.H. Kellogg, who,  in his sanitarium at Battle Creek, examines hundreds, or even  thousands of women in a year, and asserts that it is almost impossible  to find a woman whose stomach is where it belongs. This is a serious  matter, because no organ can do its work properly when it is out of  its rightful position. We understand this in any machinery except that  of the human body. We would not meddle with a man-made machine because  that would hinder its perfect working, but we do not hesitate to  interfere with the body, forgetful that it, too, is a machine,  divinely created, and with powers most fateful to us for weal or woe.    But the harm is not all done by the displacement of the organs  mentioned. The bowels suffer, and we can best understand what is done  to them when we understand how they are placed in the abdominal  cavity.    Let me take the ruffle you are making. The mesentery is a delicate,  narrow membrane about twenty feet long. We will compare it to the  ruffle. Folded in it at one edge are the small intestines, just as I  can run this bodkin into the hem of this ruffle. The other edge of the  mesentery is gathered up as you have gathered the ruffle. It is  gathered into a space of about six inches in length, and is fastened  up and down the spine in the region of the small of the back. You can  see, if I gather up twenty feet of this ruffle into a space of six  inches, how the mesentery, with the intestines folded in the free  edge, are held in the abdominal cavity. They are held loosely, and at  the same time so that the intestines cannot be tied in knots or loops  upon each other. In this way the ruffle flares out into the abdominal  cavity. The intestines should stay in their place close up under the  liver and stomach, but if pressure is brought to bear around the body  at this point, the bowels begin to sag into the abdominal cavity. The  abdominal walls lose their tonicity because they are so compressed  that they cannot have a perfect circulation, the bowels sink down  still further into the pelvis, and pull upon their attachment in the  small of the back, creating backache. The stomach sags down into the  cavity; the liver sinks, and all the organs pull upon their  attachments; so it is no wonder that women have backaches and  headaches, and their eyes feel bad, and they are unable to stand or  walk. We don't want small rooms in our dwelling-houses, we don't like  it if we haven't sufficient space for our furniture; but in this  bodily house in which we dwell we are quite willing to constrict the  rooms in which the vital organs or furniture are placed, until  everything is huddled together in the closest pressure, so that the  organs are unable to do their work. It wouldn't matter in our parlors  if the chairs and tables were huddled close together, for they are not  constantly changing in size, but it does matter in a room where  machines must have space to work and such space is not permitted them;  and we cannot expect good work where we crowd machinery so that it  does not have adequate room.    The influence of tight clothing upon the pelvic organs is to displace  them and create a great many difficulties which we know as \"Female  Diseases.\" But these, in my opinion, are not the most important  things. The important things are the displacement of the vital organs  of the body--those organs without which we cannot live, and those  organs the perfect working of which is necessary both to our health  and our happiness. If we are wise we will be exceedingly anxious that  every vital organ shall be allowed to hold its own position, to do  its own work, with plenty of room.    The impeding of the heart-action by tight clothing is not in itself  the most serious effect of this restriction. The serious trouble is in  the disturbance of the circulation. Upon a perfect circulation depends  perfect nutrition. The blood must go in sufficient quantity to every  organ in order that it may be fully nourished. When the waist is  compressed the organs do not receive their full amount of blood. It is  retained, and therefore the organs are congested. The feet are cold  because the blood does not reach them in sufficient quantity, and the  brain, it may be, is hot, because the blood is not taken from the head  with enough rapidity and furnished to the other organs. So we find  that tight clothing interferes with the integrity and health of every  organ in the body, and consequently with our happiness and with our  usefulness.    The reason we admire the tapering waist is because we have been  wrongly educated. We have acquired wrong ideas of beauty. We have  accepted the ideals of the fashion-plate rather than those of the  Creator. We find that some form of physical deformity maintains in  almost every country. The Chinese deform the feet, and we think this  is barbarous, but it is really not as serious as the deforming of the  vital parts of the body. The Flathead Indian is deformed in babyhood  by being compressed between boards until the head changes its shape.  Among some savage nations the leg is bandaged for a few inches above  the ankle and for a few inches below the knee and the "]]]
