To Darnell the true life would have seemed madness, and when, now  and again, the shadows and vague images reflected from its splendour  fell across his path, he was afraid, and took refuge in what he would  have called the sane 'reality' of common and usual incidents and  interests. His absurdity was, perhaps, the more evident, inasmuch as  'reality' for him was a matter of kitchen ranges, of saving a few  shillings; but in truth the folly would have been greater if it had been  concerned with racing stables, steam yachts, and the spending of many  thousand pounds.    But so went forth Darnell, day by day, strangely mistaking death for  life, madness for sanity, and purposeless and wandering phantoms for  true beings. He was sincerely of opinion that he was a City clerk,  living in Shepherd's Bush--having forgotten the mysteries and the  far-shining glories of the kingdom which was his by legitimate  inheritance.      II    All day long a fierce and heavy heat had brooded over the City, and as  Darnell neared home he saw the mist lying on all the damp lowlands,  wreathed in coils about Bedford Park to the south, and mounting to the  west, so that the tower of Acton Church loomed out of a grey lake. The  grass in the squares and on the lawns which he overlooked as the 'bus  lumbered wearily along was burnt to the colour of dust. Shepherd's Bush  Green was a wretched desert, trampled brown, bordered with monotonous  poplars, whose leaves hung motionless in air that was still, hot smoke.  The foot passengers struggled wearily along the pavements, and the reek  of the summer's end mingled with the breath of the brickfields made  Darnell gasp, as if he were inhaling the poison of some foul sick-room.    He made but a slight inroad into the cold mutton that adorned the  tea-table, and confessed that he felt rather 'done up' by the weather  and the day's work.    'I have had a trying day, too,' said Mary. 'Alice has been very queer  and troublesome all day, and I have had to speak to her quite seriously.  You know I think her Sunday evenings out have a rather unsettling  influence on the girl. But what is one to do?'    'Has she got a young man?'    'Of course: a grocer's assistant from the Goldhawk Road--Wilkin's, you  know. I tried them when we settled here, but they were not very  satisfactory.'    'What do they do with themselves all the evening? They have from five to  ten, haven't they?'    'Yes; five, or sometimes half-past, when the water won't boil. Well, I  believe they go for walks usually. Once or twice he has taken her to the  City Temple, and the Sunday before last they walked up and down Oxford  Street, and then sat in the Park. But it seems that last Sunday they  went to tea with his mother at Putney. I should like to tell the old  woman what I really think of her.'    'Why? What happened? Was she nasty to the girl?'    'No; that's just it. Before this, she has been very unpleasant on  several occasions. When the young man first took Alice to see her--that  was in March--the girl came away crying; she told me so herself. Indeed,  she said she never wanted to see old Mrs. Murry again; and I told Alice  that, if she had not exaggerated things, I could hardly blame her for  feeling like that.'    'Why? What did she cry for?'    'Well, it seems that the old lady--she lives in quite a small cottage in  some Putney back street--was so stately that she would hardly speak. She  had borrowed a little girl from some neighbour's family, and had managed  to dress her up to imitate a servant, and Alice said nothing could be  sillier than to see that mite opening the door, with her black dress and  her white cap and apron, and she hardly able to turn the handle, as  Alice said. George (that's the young man's name) had told Alice that it  was a little bit of a house; but he said the kitchen was comfortable,  though very plain and old-fashioned. But, instead of going straight to  the back, and sitting by a big fire on the old settle that they had  brought up from the country, that child asked for their names (did you  ever hear such nonsense?) and showed them into a little poky parlour,  where old Mrs. Murry was sitting \"like a duchess,\" by a fireplace full  of coloured paper, and the room as cold as ice. And she was so grand  that she would hardly speak to Alice.'    'That must have been very unpleasant.'    'Oh, the poor girl had a dreadful time. She began with: \"Very pleased to  make your acquaintance, Miss Dill. I know so very few persons in  service.\" Alice imitates her mincing way of talking, but I can't do it.  And then she went on to talk about her family, how they had farmed their  own land for five hundred years--such stuff! George had told Alice all  about it: they had had an old cottage with a good strip of garden and  two fields somewhere in Essex, and that old woman talked almost as if  they had been country gentry, and boasted about the Rector, Dr.  Somebody, coming to see them so often, and of Squire Somebody Else  always looking them up, as if they didn't visit them out of kindness.  Alice told me it was as much as she could do to keep from laughing in  Mrs. Murry's face, her young man having told her all about the place,  and how small it was, and how the Squire had been so kind about buying  it when old Murry died and George was a little boy, and his mother not  able to keep things going. However, that silly old woman \"laid it on  thick,\" as you say, and the young man got more and more uncomfortable,  especially when she went on to speak about marrying in one's own class,  and how unhappy she had known young men to be who had married beneath  them, giving some very pointed looks at Alice as she talked. And then  such an amusing thing happened: Alice had noticed George looking about  him in a puzzled sort of way, as if he couldn't make out something or  other, and at last he burst out and asked his mother if she had been  buying up the neighbours' ornaments, as he remembered the two green  cut-glass vases on the mantelpiece at Mrs. Ellis's, and the wax flowers  at Miss Turvey's. He was going on, but his mother scowled at him, and  upset some books, which he had to pick up; but Alice quite understood  she had been borrowing things from her neighbours, just as she had  borrowed the little girl, so as to look grander. And then they had  tea--water bewitched, Alice calls it--and very thin bread and butter,  and rubbishy foreign pastry from the Swiss shop in the High Street--all  sour froth and rancid fat, Alice declares. And then Mrs. Murry began  boasting again about her family, and snubbing Alice and talking at her,  till the girl came away quite furious, and very unhappy, too. I don't  wonder at it, do you?'    'It doesn't sound very enjoyable, certainly,' said Darnell, looking  dreamily at his wife. He had not been attending very carefully to the  subject-matter of her story, but he loved to hear a voice that was  incantation in his ears, tones that summoned before him the vision of a  magic world.    'And has the young man's mother always been like this?' he said after a  long pause, desiring that the music should continue.    'Always, till quite lately, till last Sunday in fact. Of course Alice  spoke to George Murry at once, and said, like a sensible girl, that she  didn't think it ever answered for a married couple to live with the  man's mother, \"especially,\" she went on, \"as I can see your mother  hasn't taken much of a fancy to me.\" He told her, in the usual style, it  was only his mother's way, that she didn't really mean anything, and so  on; but Alice kept away for a long time, and rather hinted, I think,  that it might come to having to choose between her and his mother. And  so affairs went on all through the spring and summer, and then, just  before the August Bank Holiday, George spoke to Alice again about it,  and told her how sorry the thought of any unpleasantness made him, and  how he wanted his mother and her to get on with each other, and how she  was only a bit old-fashioned and queer in her ways, and had spoken very  nicely to him about her when there was nobody by. So the long and the  short of it was that Alice said she might come with them on the Monday,  when they had settled to go to Hampton Court--the girl was always  talking about Hampton Court, and wanting to see it. You remember what a  beautiful day it was, don't you?'    'Let me see,' said Darnell dreamily. 'Oh yes, of course--I sat out under  the mulberry tree all day, and we had our meals there: it was quite a  picnic. The caterpillars were a nuisance, but I enjoyed the day very  much.' His ears were charmed, ravished with the grave, supernal melody,  as of antique song, rather of the first made world in which all speech  was descant, and all words were sacraments of might, speaking not to the  mind but to the soul. He lay back in his chair, and said--    'Well, what happened to them?'    'My dear, would you believe it; but that wretched old woman behaved  worse than ever. They met as had been arranged, at Kew Bridge, and got  places, with a good deal of difficulty, in one of those char-a-banc  things, and Alice thought she was going to enjoy herself tremendously.  Nothing of the kind. They had hardly said \"Good morning,\" when old Mrs.  Murry began to talk about Kew Gardens, and how beautiful it must be  there, and how much more convenient it was than Hampton, and no expense  at all; just the trouble of walking over the bridge. Then she went on  to say, as they were waiting for the char-a-banc, that she had always  heard there was nothing to see at Hampton, except a lot of nasty, grimy  old pictures, and some of them not fit for any decent woman, let alone  girl, to look at, and she wondered why the Queen allowed such things to  be shown, putting all kinds of notions into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25023"],[0,"The Biography of a Grizzly (#8)"],[1,"xious, to fight to a finish for this  desirable range.        [Illustration: \"HE DELIBERATELY STOOD UP ON THE PINE ROOT.\"]    Maybe it was accident and maybe design, but when the Roachback jumped from  the root it rolled to one side. Baldy went on down the canyon, keeping the  keenest lookout for his enemy.    It was not long before Wahb found the trail of the interloper, and all the  ferocity of his outside-the-Park nature was aroused.    He followed the trail for miles on more than one occasion. But the small  Bear was quick-footed as well as quick-witted, and never showed himself. He  made a point, however, of calling at each sign-post, and if there was any  means of cheating, so that his mark might be put higher, he did it with a  vim, and left a big, showy record. But if there was no chance for any but  a fair register, he would not go near the tree, but looked for a fresh tree  near by with some log or side-ledge to reach from.        [Illustration]    Thus Wahb soon found the interloper's marks towering far above his own--a  monstrous Bear evidently, that even he could not be sure of mastering. But  Wahb was no coward. He was ready to fight to a finish anyone that might  come; and he hunted the range for that invader. Day after day Wahb sought  for him and held himself ready to fight. He found his trail daily, and more  and more often he found that towering record far above his own. He often  smelled him on the wind; but he never saw him, for the old Grizzly's eyes  had grown very dim of late years; things but a little way off were mere  blurs to him. The continual menace could not but fill Wahb with uneasiness,  for he was not young now, and his teeth and claws were worn and blunted. He  was more than ever troubled with pains in his old wounds, and though he  could have risen on the spur of the moment to fight any number of Grizzlies  of any size, still the continual apprehension, the knowledge that he must  hold himself ready at any moment to fight this young monster, weighed on  his spirits and began to tell on his general health.        [Illustration]              IV      The Roachback's life was one of continual vigilance, always ready to run,  doubling and shifting to avoid the encounter that must mean instant death  to him. Many a time from some hiding-place he watched the great Bear, and  trembled lest the wind should betray him. Several times his very impudence  saved him, and more than once he was nearly cornered in a box-canyon. Once  he escaped only by climbing up a long crack in a cliff, which Wahb's huge  frame could not have entered. But still, in a mad persistence, he kept on  marking the trees farther into the range.        [Illustration]    At last he scented and followed up the sulphur-bath. He did not understand  it at all. It had no appeal to him, but hereabouts were the tracks of the  owner. In a spirit of mischief the Roachback scratched dirt into the  spring, and then seeing the rubbing-tree, he stood sidewise on the rocky  ledge, and was thus able to put his mark fully five feet above that of  Wahb. Then he nervously jumped down, and was running about, defiling the  bath and keeping a sharp lookout, when he heard a noise in the woods  below. Instantly he was all alert. The sound drew near, then the wind  brought the sure proof, and the Roachback, in terror, turned and fled into  the woods.        [Illustration: \"THE ROACHBACK FLED INTO THE WOODS.\"]        [Illustration]    It was Wahb. He had been failing in health of late; his old pains were on  him again, and, as well as his hind leg, had seized his right shoulder,  where were still lodged two rifle-balls. He was feeling very ill, and  crippled with pain. He came up the familiar bank at a jerky limp, and there  caught the odor of the foe; then he saw the track in the mud--his eyes said  the track of a _small_ Bear, but his eyes were dim now, and his nose, his  unerring nose, said, \"This is the track of the huge invader.\" Then he  noticed the tree with his sign on it, and there beyond doubt was the  stranger's mark far above his own. His eyes and nose were agreed on this;  and more, they told him that the foe was close at hand, might at any moment  come.        [Illustration]    Wahb was feeling ill and weak with pain. He was in no mood for a desperate  fight. A battle against such odds would be madness now. So, without taking  the treatment, he turned and swung along the bench away from the direction  taken by the stranger--the first time since his cubhood that he had  declined to fight.    That was a turning-point in Wahb's life. If he had followed up the  stranger he would have found the miserable little craven trembling,  cowering, in an agony of terror, behind a log in a natural trap, a  walled-in glade only fifty yards away, and would surely have crushed him.  Had he even taken the bath, his strength and courage would have been  renewed, and if not, then at least in time he would have met his foe, and  his after life would have been different. But he had turned. This was the  fork in the trail, but he had no means of knowing it.        [Illustration]    He limped along, skirting the lower spurs of the Shoshones, and soon came  on that horrid smell that he had known for years, but never followed up or  understood. It was right in his road, and he traced it to a small, barren  ravine that was strewn over with skeletons and dark objects, and Wahb, as  he passed, smelled a smell of many different animals, and knew by its  quality that they were lying dead in this treeless, grassless hollow. For  there was a cleft in the rocks at the upper end, whence poured a deadly  gas; invisible but heavy, it filled the little gulch like a brimming poison  bowl, and at the lower end there was a steady overflow. But Wahb knew only  that the air that poured from it as he passed made him dizzy and sleepy,  and repelled him, so that he got quickly away from it and was glad once  more to breathe the piny wind.    Once Wahb decided to retreat, it was all too easy to do so next time; and  the result worked double disaster. For, since the big stranger was allowed  possession of the sulphur-spring, Wahb felt that he would rather not go  there. Sometimes when he came across the traces of his foe, a spurt of his  old courage would come back. He would rumble that thunder-growl as of old,  and go painfully lumbering along the trail to settle the thing right then  and there. But he never overtook the mysterious giant, and his rheumatism,  growing worse now that he was barred from the cure, soon made him daily  less capable of either running or fighting.    Sometimes Wahb would sense his foe's approach when he was in a bad place  for fighting, and, without really running, he would yield to a wish to be  on a better footing, where he would have a fair chance. This better footing  never led him nearer the enemy, for it is well known that the one awaiting  has the advantage.    Some days Wahb felt so ill that it would have been madness to have staked  everything on a fight, and when he felt well or a little better, the  stranger seemed to keep away.        [Illustration]    Wahb soon found that the stranger's track was most often on the Warhouse  and the west slope of the Piney, the very best feeding-grounds. To avoid  these when he did not feel equal to fighting was only natural, and as he  was always in more or less pain now, it amounted to abandoning to the  stranger the best part of the range.        [Illustration]    Weeks went by. Wahb had meant to go back to his bath, but he never did. His  pains grew worse; he was now crippled in his right shoulder as well as in  his hind leg.    The long strain of waiting for the fight begot anxiety, that grew to be  apprehension, which, with the sapping of his strength, was breaking down  his courage, as it always must when courage is founded on muscular force.  His daily care now was not to meet and fight the invader, but to avoid him  till he felt better.    Thus that first little retreat grew into one long retreat. Wahb had to go  farther and farther down the Piney to avoid an encounter. He was daily  worse fed, and as the weeks went by was daily less able to crush a foe.    He was living and hiding at last on the Lower Piney--the very place where  once his Mother had brought him with his little brothers. The life he led  now was much like the one he had led after that dark day. Perhaps for the  same reason. If he had had a family of his own all might have been  different. As he limped along one morning, seeking among the barren aspen  groves for a few roots, or the wormy partridge-berries that were too poor  to interest the Squirrel and the Grouse, he heard a stone rattle down the  western slope into the woods, and, a little later, on the wind was borne  the dreaded taint. He waded through the ice-cold Piney,--once he would have  leaped it,--and the chill water sent through and up each great hairy limb  keen pains that seemed to reach his very life. He was retreating  again--which way? There seemed but one way now--toward the new ranch-house.        [Illustration]    But there were signs of stir about it long before he was near enough to be  seen. His nose, his trustiest friend, said, \"Turn, turn and seek the  hills,\" and turn he did even at the risk of meeting there the dreadful  foe. He limped painfully along the north bank of the Piney, keeping in the  hollows and among the trees. He tried to climb a cliff that of old he had  often bounded up at full speed. When half-way up his footing gave way, and  down he rolled to the bottom. A long way round was now the only road, for  onward he must go--on--on. But where? There seemed no choice now but to  abandon the whole range to the terrible stranger.        [Illustration]    And feeling, as far as a Bear can feel, that he is fallen, defeated,  dethroned at last, that he is driven from his ancient range by a Bear too  strong for him to face, he turned up the"]]]
