[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#8)"],[1,"July to October.      _Amanita pellucidula. Ban._    Pileus at first campanulate, then expanded, slightly viscid, fleshy in  center, attenuated at the margin; color a smooth bright red, deeper at  the top, shaded into clear transparent yellow at the margin; glossy,  flesh white, unchanging.    The gills are ventricose, free, numerous, yellow.    The stem is stuffed, ring descending, fugacious. Peck's 44th Report.    This species differs from Amanita caesarea in having an even margin and a  white stem. It is only a form of the caesarea. The white stem will  attract the attention of the collector.      _Amanita solitaria. Bull._    THE SOLITARY AMANITA.    [Illustration: Figure 17.--Amanita solitaria. Two-thirds natural size,  showing the peculiar veil.]    [Illustration: Figure 18.--Amanita solitaria. Two-thirds natural size,  showing scaly cap and stem.]    [Illustration: Plate II. Figure 19.--Amanita solitaria.    Natural size, showing scaly cap and stem, plant white.]    Solitary, growing alone. I have found this plant in various parts of the  state and have always found them growing alone. In Poke Hollow, where I  found the specimens in the illustrations, I found several on the  hillside on different occasions, but I have never found them growing in  groups. It is quite large in size, white or whitish, very woolly or  floccose. Usually the cap, stem, and the gills are covered with a  floccose substance which will serve to identify the species. This fluffy  exterior adheres readily to your hands or clothing. The cap is sometimes  tinged with brown, but the flesh is white and smells quite strong, not  unlike chloride of lime. The annulus is frequently torn from the stem  and is found adhering to the margin of the cap.    The pileus is from three to five inches broad, or more, when fully  expanded, at first globose to hemispherical, as will be seen in Figures  17 and 18, convex, or plane, warty, white or whitish, the pointed scales  being easily rubbed off, or washed off by heavy rains, these scales  varying in size from small granules to quite large conical flakes, and  differing in condition and color in different plants.    The gills are free, or are not attached by the upper part, the edges are  frequently floccose where they are torn from the slight connection with  the upper surface of the veil; white, or slightly tinged with  cream-color, broad.    The stem is four to eight inches high, solid, becoming stuffed when old,  bulbous, rooting deep in the soil, very scaly, ventricose sometimes in  young plants, white, very mealy. Volva friable. Ring, large, lacerated,  usually hanging to the margin of the cap, but in Figure 19 it adheres to  the stem.    This is a large and beautiful plant in the woods, and easily identified  because of its floccose nature and the large bulb at the base of the  stem. It is not so warty and the odor is not nearly so strong as the  Amanita strobiliformis. It is edible but very great caution should be  used to be sure of your species. Found from July to October in woods and  roadsides.      _Amanita radicata. Pk._    [Illustration: Figure 20.--Amanita radicata. Two-thirds natural size,  showing scaly cap, bulbous stem and root broken off and peculiar veil.]    Radicata means furnished with a root. The root of the specimen in Figure  20 was broken off in getting it out of the ground.    The pileus is subglobose, becoming convex, dry, verrucose, white, margin  even, flesh firm, white, odor resembling that of chloride of lime.    The gills are close, free, white.    The stem is solid, deeply radicating, swollen at the base or bulbous,  floccose or mealy at the top, white; veil thin, floccose, or mealy,  white, soon lacerated and attached in fragments to the margin of the  pileus or evanescent. The spores are broadly elliptic, 7.5-10u long,  6-7u broad. _Peck._    This is quite a large and beautiful plant, very closely related to  Amanita strobiliformis, but readily distinguished from it because of its  white color, its clearly radiating stem, and small spores. The stem  shows to be bulbous and the cap covered with warts. I found the plant  frequently in Poke Hollow and on Ralston's Run. July and August.    [Illustration: Figure 21.--Amanita radicata.]      _Amanita strobiliformis. Fr._    THE FIR-CONE AMANITA.    [Illustration: Plate III. Figure 22.--Amanita strobiliformis.    Young plant showing veil covering the entire gill-surface of the plant.  Cap covered with persistent warts, stem rough and rooting, odor strong  of chloride of lime.]    [Illustration: Plate IV. Figure 23.--Amanita strobiliformis.    Showing long root.]    Strobiliformis means fir-cone form; so called from the similarity of its  undeveloped form to that of the strobile of the pine.    The pileus is six to eight inches broad, when young, subglobose, then  convex, expanded, nearly plane, with persistent warts, white, ash-color,  sometimes yellow on the cap, the margin even and extending beyond the  gills; warts hard, angular, pointed, white; flesh white, compact.    The gills are free, crowded, rounded, white, becoming yellow.    The stem is five to eight inches long, frequently longer, tapering  upward, floccosely scaly, bulbous, rooting beyond the bulb; ring large,  torn; volva forming concentric rings. The spores are 13-14x8-9u.    This is one of the most stately plants in the woods. It is said to be  edible, but the strong pungent odor, like chloride of lime, has deterred  me from eating it. This, however, is said to disappear in cooking. It  grows to be very large. Dr. Kellerman and I found a specimen in Haynes's  Hollow whose stem measured over eleven inches, and cap nine inches. It  is found in open woods and wood margins. Great caution should be used  before the plant is eaten to know it beyond doubt. Found July to  October.      _Amanita mappa. Fr._    THE DELICATE AMANITA. POISONOUS.    [Illustration: Figure 24.--Amanita mappa. Natural size, showing long  smooth stem, cap yellowish-white and ring.]    Mappa means a napkin, so called from the volva. The pileus is two to  three inches broad, convex, then expanded, plane, obtuse or depressed,  without separable cuticle; margin nearly even; white or yellowish,  usually with patches of the volva dry.    The gills are adnexed, close, narrow, shining, white.    The stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, then hollow, cylindrical,  nearly smooth, bulbous, nearly globose at the base, white, almost equal  above the bulb.    The volva with its free margin is acute and narrow. The ring is  membranaceous, superior, soft, lax, ragged.    Its color is quite as variable and its habits are much like A.  phalloides, from which it can only be distinguished by its less  developed volva, which, instead of being cup-shaped, is little more than  a mere rim fringing the bulb. The odor at times is very strong. It is  found in open woods and under brush. Label it poisonous.      _Amanita crenulata. Pk._    [Illustration: Figure 25.--Amanita crenulata.]    Crenulata means bearing notches, referring to the crenulate form of the  gills, which are very distinct.    The pileus is thin, two to two and a half inches broad, broadly ovate,  becoming convex, or nearly plane, somewhat striate on the margin,  adorned with a few thin whitish floccose warts or with whitish  flocculent patches, whitish or grayish, sometimes tinged with yellow.    The gills are close, reaching the stem, and sometimes forming decurrent  lines upon it, floccose crenulate on the edge, the short ones truncate  at the inner extremity, white.    The stem is equal, bulbous, floccose mealy above, stuffed or hollow,  white, the annulus slight, evanescent. Spores broadly elliptic or  subglobose, 7.5-10 long, nearly as broad, usually containing a single  large nucleus. _Peck_, Bull. Tor. Bot. Club.    The stem is bulbous at the base but the volva is rarely seen upon it  although slight patches are frequently seen on the pileus. The ring is  very evanescent and soon disappears. The specimens I have received from  Mrs. Blackford look good enough to eat and she speaks highly of the  edible qualities of this species. So far as I know this plant is  confined to the New England states. Found from September to November. It  grows in low damp ground under trees.      _Amanita cothurnata. Atkinson._    THE BOOTED AMANITA.    [Illustration: Figure 26.--Amanita cothurnata. Slightly reduced from  natural size, showing different stages of development.]    Cothurnata means buskined; from corthunus, a high shoe or buskin worn by  actors. This species is easily separated from the other Amanitas. I  shall give Prof. Atkinson's description of it in full: \"The pileus is  fleshy and passes from nearly globose to hemispherical, convex,  expanded, and when specimens are very old sometimes the margin is  elevated. It is usually white, though specimens are found with a tinge  of citron yellow in the center or of tawny yellow in the center of other  specimens. The pileus is viscid, strongly so when moist. It is finely  striate on the margin, and covered with numerous, white, floccose scales  from the upper half of the volva, forming more or less dense patches,  which may wash off in heavy rains.    The gills are rounded next the stem, and quite remote from it. The edge  of the gills is often eroded or frazzly from the torn-out threads with  which they were loosely connected to the upper side of the veil in the  young or button stage. The spores are globose or nearly so, with a large  \"nucleus\" nearly filling the spore.    The stem is cylindrical, even, and expanded below into quite a large  oval bulb, the stem just above the bulb being margined by a  close-fitting roll of the volva, and the upper edge of this presenting  the appearance of having been sewed at the top like the rolled edge of a  garment or buskin. The surface of the stem is minutely floccose, scaly  or strongly so, and decidedly hollow even from a very young stage or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29233"],[0,"The 2008 CIA World Factbook (#8)"],[1,"cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on  board) basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Imports - commodities:  This entry provides a listing of the highest-  valued imported products; it sometimes includes the percent of total  dollar value.    Imports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading  partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the  percent of total dollar value.    Independence:  For most countries, this entry gives the date that  sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship.  For the other countries, the date given may not represent  \"independence\" in the strict sense, but rather some significant  nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of  unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental  change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas  include the notation \"none\" followed by the nature of their dependency  status. Also see the Terminology note.    Industrial production growth rate:  This entry gives the annual  percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,  mining, and construction).    Industries:  This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting  with the largest by value of annual output.    Infant mortality rate:  This entry gives the number of deaths of  infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the  same year; included is the total death rate, and deaths by sex, male  and female. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of  health in a country.    Inflation rate (consumer prices):  This entry furnishes the annual  percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's  consumer prices.    International disputes:  see Disputes - international    International organization participation:  This entry lists in  alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations in  which the subject country is a member or participates in some other  way.    International organizations:  This information is presented in Appendix  B: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,  abbreviation, date established, aim, and members by category.    Internet country code:  This entry includes the two-letter codes  maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers  Authority (IANA) to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).    Internet hosts:  This entry lists the number of Internet hosts  available within a country. An Internet host is a computer connected  directly to the Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP)  computer is a host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired  terminal, at an institution with a mainframe computer connected  directly to the Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via  telephone line, cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's  host computer. The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of  Internet connectivity.    Internet users:  This entry gives the number of users within a country  that access the Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and  may include users who access the Internet at least several times a week  to those who access it only once within a period of several months.    Introduction:  This category includes one entry, Background.    Investment (gross fixed):  This entry records total business spending  on fixed assets, such as factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings,  and inventories of raw materials, which provide the basis for future  production. It is measured gross of the depreciation of the assets,  i.e., it includes investment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped  capital.    Irrigated land:  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of  land area that is artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch:  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest  court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.    Labor force:  This entry contains the total labor force figure.    Labor force - by occupation:  This entry lists the percentage  distribution of the labor force by occupation. The distribution will  total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete.    Land boundaries:  This entry contains the total length of all land  boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border  countries. When available, official lengths published by national  statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ,  country border lengths reported by contiguous countries may differ.    Land use:  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area  for three different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated  for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each  harvest; permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus,  coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes  land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but  excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land  not arable or under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and  pastures, forests and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land,  etc.    Languages:  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting  with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population  speaking that language.    Legal system:  This entry contains a brief description of the legal  system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of  International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.    Legislative branch:  This entry contains information on the structure  (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and  term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or  accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next  election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number  of seats held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth:  This entry contains the average number of  years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if  mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry  includes total population as well as the male and female components.  Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life  in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be  thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human  capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial  measures.    Literacy:  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census  Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There  are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless  otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition  - the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the  standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read  and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy,  while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the  most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low  levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic  development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-  driven world.    Location:  This entry identifies the country's regional location,  neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Major infectious diseases:  This entry lists major infectious diseases  likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases  is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These  infectious diseases represent risks to US government personnel  traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three  years. The degree of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature  of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of  being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not  necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local  population.    The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific  location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations,  time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine  physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend  appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.    Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown  in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note: The  sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries  may vary according to local conditions.    food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the  local economy:    Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the  liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with  fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit  fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged  symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.    Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the  functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal  contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,  abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.    Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or  water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained  high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.    vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected  arthropod:    Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;  transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;  parasites multiply in the liver attacking red"]]]
