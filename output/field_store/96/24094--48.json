Most of the food part of the  grain has been turned into alcohol.      CIDER.    The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider. As soon as the  cider begins to turn sour, or \"hard,\" as people say, alcohol begins to  form in it.    Pure water is good, and apples are good. But the apple-juice begins to  be a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it. In  cider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours  after it is pressed out of the apples.    None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real  strength.    Then why do people think they can?    Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the  brain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted.    The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more  than they really can. This false feeling of strength lasts only a little  while. When it has passed, men feel weaker than before.    A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by  the captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places.    Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was  the custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum. This liquor is  distilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol. This rum  was given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great  storm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give  them twice as much rum as usual.    [Illustration]    The captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no  stronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt  weaker. So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship. Once out  on the ocean, of course the men could not get any.    At first, they did not like it; but the captain was very careful to have  their food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet  and cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink. By the time they  had crossed the ocean, the men said: \"The captain is right. We have  worked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum.\"      STRENGTH OF MIND.    We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best  kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind.    Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can  not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well.  Alcohol does not strengthen the mind.    Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every  person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make  him useful and happy.    Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to  work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you  be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been  poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a  palace, and had a million of dollars?    If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not  let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1.

How does alcohol affect the strength of the            mind?          CHAPTER XIV.    THE HEART.      [Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong  box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for  each of us.    It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a  beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger.      HOW THE HEART WORKS.    Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water  through a hose upon a burning building.    As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the  working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped  like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the  body. These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz).    Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called  veins (v[=a]nz). You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist.    If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the  steady beating of the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart is  pumping and the blood flowing.    The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the  heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right.    Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we  eat and drink, to every part of the body.    To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every  part.    So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and  carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part,  just what it needs.      THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN.    As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good  blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food.  It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.    We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood. If we  take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain. There it  affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions.      EXERCISE.    When you run, you can feel your heart beating. It gets an instant of  rest between the beats.    Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the  body better than a fire could do.      DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?    Your heart is made of muscle. You know what harm alcohol does to the  muscles.    Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart? No more than a  fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm. Besides, alcohol makes  the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. Where is the heart placed?              2. Of what is it made?              3.

How does exercise in the fresh air help the            heart?              10. What harm does alcohol do to the heart?          CHAPTER XV.    THE LUNGS.      [Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food  to every part. It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter  that can no longer be used. By the time it is ready to be sent back by  the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red. It is dull and bluish in  color, because it is full of impurities.    If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look  blue.    If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to  pump out bad blood next time? No, for the heart has neighbors very near  at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again.      THE LUNGS.    These neighbors are the lungs. They are in the chest on each side of  the heart. When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or  expand, to take in the air. Then they contract again, and the air passes  out through your mouth or nose. The lungs must have plenty of fresh air,  and plenty of room to work in.    [Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._]    If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand,  they can not take in so much air as they should. Then the blood can not  be made pure, and the whole body will suffer.    For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one  of impure air.    In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go  back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body  again.    How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can  not yet understand. By and by, when you are older, you will learn more  about it.      CARE OF THE LUNGS.    Do the lungs ever rest?    You never stop breathing, not even in the night. But if you watch your  own breathing you will notice a little pause between the breaths. Each  pause is a rest. But the lungs are very steady workers, both by night  and by day. The least we can do for them, is to give them fresh air and  plenty of room to work in.    You may say: \"We can't give them more room than they have. They are  shut up in our chests.\"    I have seen people who wore such tight clothes that their lungs did not  have room to take a full breath. If any part of the lungs can not  expand, it will become useless. If your lungs can not take in air enough  to purify the blood, you can not be so well and strong as God intended,  and your life will be shortened.    If some one was sewing for you, you would not think of shutting her up  in a little place where she could not move her hands freely. The lungs  are breathing for you, and need room enough to do their work.      THE AIR.    The lungs breathe out the waste matter that they have taken from the  blood. This waste matter poisons the air. If we should close all the  doors and windows, and the fireplace or opening into the chimney, and  leave not even a crack by which the fresh air could come in, we would  die simply from staying in such a room. The lungs could not do their  work"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25718"],[0,"The Watchers of the Trails: A Book of Animal Life (#8)"],[1,"sniffed at the familiar scent, which to him, as  pleasant memories of food and companionship welled up in his heart,  represented nothing but kindliness. His little disagreements with his  trainer were forgotten. He remembered only his unfailing friends, the  manager and the clown. The trail was a broad and mixed one,--the trail  of oxen, and of men with larriganed feet. It led toward a camp of  lumbermen, near the river. Joyously and confidently the exile followed  it. Soon he heard men's voices, and the familiar clank of chains. Then  a biting breeze drew through the forest,--biting, but sweet to the  bear's nostrils. It carried a savour of richness from the cook's  steaming boilers. It was dinner-hour at the camp.    For the second time in his life, the bear felt that he had come home.  Captive, indeed, he had been among men,--but a captive always highly  valued and heedfully cared for. He never for a moment doubted that  these men-creatures, who had always wanted him, would want him now.  They would chain him up, of course,--for fear he would change his mind  and leave them again. But they would feed him,--all he could eat; and  stare at him; and admire him. Then he would dance for them, and do  foolish things with a gun, and perhaps stand on his head. Whereupon  they would applaud, and laugh, and feed him with peanuts and  gingerbread. His famished jaws dripped at the thought.    Within the camp one of the hands, glancing from the window, saw him  just as he came in view. In an instant every man was looking out. The  boldness of the animal stirred up a great excitement. His terrible  leanness was noticed. He was coming straight for the door,--evidently  savage, insane with hunger! And such a big fellow, too!    Men seized their axes. The boss snatched down his big-bore Snider  rifle, slipped in a cartridge, and coolly threw open the cabin door.  He was a tall, ruddy-faced, wide-mouthed man, much like the kindly  manager of the show. At sight of him, standing there in the door, the  bear was overjoyed, and broke into a shuffling run.    Seeing what seemed to them such reckless ferocity, the lumbermen cried  out in amazement, and shouted hoarse warnings to the boss. But the  boss was a man of nerve. Raising his rifle to the shoulder, he stepped  right out clear of the door. He was a dead shot, and very proud of the  fact. When the bear was within thirty paces of him, he fired.    The massive bullet sped true; and the exile fell forward on his snout  without a gasp, shot through the brain.    The men gathered about the body, praising the shot, praising the  prize, praising the reckless audacity which had led the beast to rush  upon his doom. Then in the long, loose fur that clothed his bones they  found the heavy collar. At that they all wondered. The boss examined  it minutely, and stood pondering; and the frank pride upon his face  gradually died into regret.    \"I swan, boys,\" said he, presently, \"if that ain't the b'ar that run  away from the circus las' fall! I heard tell he was reckoned always  kind!\"          The Little Wolf of the Pool      The bottom of the pool (it was too small to be called a pond) was  muddy, with here and there a thicket of rushes or arrow-weed stems.  Down upon the windless surface streamed the noon sun warmly. Under its  light the bottom was flecked with shadows of many patterns,--circular,  heart-shaped, spear-shaped, netted, and barred. There were other  shadows that were no more than ghosts of shadows, cast by faint,  diaphanous films of scum which scarcely achieved to blur the clear  downpour of radiance, but were nevertheless perceived and appreciated  by many of the delicate larval creatures which made a large part of  the life of the pool.    For all its surface tranquillity and its shining summer peace, the  pool was thronged with life. Beneath the surface, among the weeds and  stalks, the gleams and shadows, there was little of tranquillity or  peace. Almost all the many-formed and strange-shaped inhabitants of  the pool were hunting or being hunted, preying or being preyed  upon,--from the goggle-eyed, green-throated bullfrog under the willow  root, down to the swarming animalculae which it required a microscope  to see. Small crawling things everywhere dotted the mud or tried to  hide under the sticks and stones. Curled fresh-water snails moved up  and down the stems of the lilies. Shining little black water-bugs  scurried swiftly in all directions. In sheltered places near the  surface, under the leaves, wriggled the slim gray larvae of the  mosquitoes. And hither and thither, in flickering shoals, darted  myriads of baby minnows, from half an inch to an inch and a half in  length.    In a patch of vivid sunshine, about six inches from a tangle of  arrow-weed stems, a black tadpole lay basking. Light to him meant not  only growth, but life. Whenever, with the slow wheeling of the sun,  the shadow of a lily leaf moved over him, he wriggled impatiently  aside, and settled down again on the brightest part of the mud. Most  of the time he seemed to be asleep; but in reality he was keeping that  incessant sharp lookout which, for the pool-dwellers, was the price of  survival.    Swimming slowly up toward the other side of the arrow-weed stems, came  a fantastic-looking creature, something more than an inch and a half  in length. It had a long, tapering, ringed and armoured body, ending  in a spine; a thick, armoured thorax, with six legs attached; and a  large head, the back of which was almost covered by two big, dully  staring globes of eyes. The whole front of its head--part of the eyes,  and all the face--was covered by a smooth, cleft, shieldlike mask,  reaching well down under the breast, and giving the creature an  expression both mysterious and terrible. On its back, folded close and  obviously useless, were rigidly encased attempts at wings.    The little monster swam slowly by the motion of its long and strong  legs, thrusting out two short, hornlike antennae over the top of its  mask. It seemed to be eyeing a snail-shell on a stem above, and  waiting for the snail's soft body to emerge from the citadel; when on  a sudden, through the stems, it caught sight of the basking tadpole.  Instantly it became motionless, and sank, like a waterlogged twig, to  the level of the mud. It crept around, effacing itself against the  brown and greenish roots, till it was just opposite the quarry.  Then it sprang, propelling itself not only by its legs, but by the  violent ejection of a little stream of water from the powerful  breathing-valves near its tail.    The tadpole, as we have seen, was not asleep. With a convulsive  wriggle of its tail it darted away in a panic. It was itself no mean  swimmer, but it could not escape the darting terror that pursued. When  the masked form was almost within reach of its victim, the mask  dropped down and shot straight out, working on a sort of elbow-shaped  lever, and at the same time revealed at its extremity a pair of  powerful mandibles. These mandibles snapped firm hold of the victim at  the base of its wriggling tail. The elbow-shaped lever drew back, till  the squirming prize was held close against its captor's face. Then  with swift jets from the turbine arrangement of its abdominal gills,  the strange monster darted back to a retreat among the weed stems,  where it could devour its prey in seclusion.    Under those inexorable jaws the tadpole soon disappeared and for a few  minutes the monster rested, working its mandibles to and fro and  rubbing them with its front legs before folding back that inscrutable  mask over its savage face. Presently a plump minnow, more than an inch  long, with a black stripe along its bronze and silver sides, swam down  close by the arrow-weed stems. The big eyes of the monster never  moved. But, suddenly, out shot the mask once more, revealing the face  of doom behind it; and those hooked mandibles fixed themselves in the  belly of the minnow. Inexorable as was the grip, it nevertheless for  the moment left unimpeded the swimming powers of the victim; and he  was a strong swimmer. With lashing tail and beating fins, he dragged  his captor out from among the weed stems. For a few seconds there was  a vehement struggle. Then the minnow was borne down upon the mud, out  in the broad sheen where, a little before, the tadpole had been  basking. Clutching ferociously with its six long legs, the conqueror  crawled over the prey and bit its backbone in two.    Swift, strong, insatiably ravenous, immeasurably fierce, the larva of  the dragon-fly (for such the little monster was) had fair title to be  called the wolf of the pool. Its appearance alone was enough to daunt  all rivals. Even the great black carnivorous water-beetle, with all  its strength and fighting equipment, was careful to give wide berth to  that dreadful, quick-darting mask. Had these little wolves been as  numerous as they were rapacious, there would soon have been left no  life at all in the pool but theirs and that of the frogs. Between  these there would have been a long and doubtful struggle, the frogs  hunting the larvae among the weed stems, and the larvae devouring the  tadpoles on their basking-grounds.    It chanced that the particular larva whose proceedings we have noted  was just on the eve of that change which should transport it to the  world of air. After eating the minnow it somehow failed to recover its  appetite, and remained, all the rest of the day and through the night,  clinging to one of the weed stems. Next morning, when the sun was warm  on the pool, it crawled slowly up, up, up, till it came out into a new  element, and the untried air fanned it dry. Its great round eyes,  formerly dull and opaque, had now grown transparent, and were gleaming  like live jewels, an indescribable blend of emerald, sapphire, and  amethyst. Presently its armour, now for the first time drying in the  sun, split apart down the"]]]
