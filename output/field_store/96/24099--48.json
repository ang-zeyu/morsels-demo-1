Several  persons from Colorado Springs, one of them a professor of the college,  were spending their outing at the cottage, and a delightful fellowship  we had, discussing birds, literature, and mountain climbing.    After resting awhile, I strolled up the valley to listen to the vesper  concert of the birds, and a rich one it was. The western robins were  piping their blithesome \"Cheerilies,\" Audubon's warblers were trilling  in the pines, and, most of all--but here I had one of the most  gratifying finds in all my mountain quest. It will perhaps be remembered  that the white-crowned sparrows, so plentiful in the upper valley, were  not to be seen in the valley of Moraine Lake. Still there were  compensations in this cloistered dip among the towering mountains; the  mountain hermit thrushes--sometimes called Audubon's thrushes--found the  sequestered valley precisely to their liking, and on the evening in  question I saw them and heard their pensive cadences for the first time.  Such exquisite tones, which seemed to take vocal possession of the vale  and the steep, pine-clad mountain side, it has seldom been my good  fortune to hear. Scores of the birds were singing simultaneously, some  of their voices pitched high in the scale and others quite low, as  though they were furnishing both the air and the contralto of the  chorus. It was my first opportunity to listen to the songs of any of the  several varieties of hermit thrushes, and I freely confess that I came,  a willing captive, under the spell of their minstrelsy, so sweet and sad  and far away, and yet so rich in vocal expression. In the latter part of  the run, which is all too brief, there is a strain which bears close  resemblance to the liquid melody of the eastern wood-thrush, but the  opening notes have a pathetic quality all their own. Perhaps Charles G.  D. Roberts can give some idea of one's feelings at a time like this:        \"O hermit of evening! thine hour        Is the sacrament of desire,      When love hath a heavenlier flower,        And passion a holier fire.\"    A happy moment it was when a nest of this mountain hermit was  discovered, saddled on one of the lower limbs of a pine and containing  four eggs of a rich green color. These birds are partial to dense pine  forests on the steep, rocky mountain sides. They are extremely shy and  elusive, evidently believing that hermit thrushes ought to be heard and  not seen. A score or more may be singing at a stone's throw up an  acclivity, but if you clamber toward them they will simply remove  further up the mountain, making your effort to see and hear them at  close range unavailing. That evening, however, as the gloaming settled  upon the valley, one selected a perch on a dead branch some distance up  the hillside, and obligingly permitted me to obtain a fair view of him  with my glass. The hermits breed far up in the mountains, the greatest  altitude at which I found them being on the sides of Bald Mountain,  above Seven Lakes and a little below the timber-line. To this day their  sad refrains are ringing in my ears, bringing back the thought of many  half-mournful facts and incidents that haunt the memory.    A good night's rest in the cottage, close beneath the unceiled roof,  prepared the bird-lover for an all-day ramble. The matutinal concert was  early in full swing, the hermit thrushes, western robins, and Audubon's  warblers being the chief choralists. One gaudy Audubon's warbler visited  the quaking asp grove surrounding the cottage, and trilled the choicest  selections of his repertory. Farther up the valley several Wilson's  warblers were seen and heard. A shy little bird flitting about in the  tangle of grass and bushes in the swampy ground above the lake was a  conundrum to me for a long time, but I now know that it was Lincoln's  sparrow, which was later found in other ravines among the mountains. It  is an exceedingly wary bird, keeping itself hidden amid the bushy  clusters for the greater part of the time, now and then venturing to  peep out at the intruder, and then bolting quickly into a safe covert.  Occasionally it will hop out upon the top of a bush in plain sight, and  remain for a few moments, just long enough for you to fix its identity  and note the character of its pleasing trill. Some of these points were  settled afterwards and not on the morning of my first meeting with the  chary little songster.    My plan for the day was to retrace my steps of the previous afternoon,  by climbing over the ridge into the upper valley and visiting the famous  Seven Lakes, which I had missed the day before through a miscalculation  in my direction. Clark's crows and the mountain jays were abundant on  the acclivities. One of the latter dashed out of a pine bush with a  clatter that almost raised the echoes, but, look as I would, I could  find no nest or young or anything else that would account for the  racket.    The Seven Lakes are beautiful little sheets of transparent water,  embosomed among the mountains in a somewhat open valley where there is  plenty of sunshine. They are visible from the summit of Pike's Peak,  from which distant viewpoint they sparkle like sapphire gems in a  setting of green. As seen from the Peak they appear to be quite close  together, and the land about them seems perfectly level, but when you  visit the place itself, you learn that some of them are separated from  the others by ridges of considerable height. Beautiful and sequestered  as the spot is, I did not find as many birds as I expected. Not a duck  or water bird of any kind was seen. Perhaps there is too much hunting  about the lakes, and, besides, winged visitors here would have  absolutely no protection, for the banks are free of bushes of any  description, and no rushes or flags grow in the shallower parts. On the  ridges and mountain sides the kinglets and hermit thrushes were  abundant, a robin was carolling, a Batchelder woodpecker chirped and  pounded in his tumultuous way, Clark's crows and several magpies lilted  about, while below the lakes in the copses the white-crowned sparrows  and green-tailed towhees held lyrical carnival, their sway disputed only  by the natty Wilson's warblers.    It was a pleasure to be alive and well in such a place, where one  breathed invigoration at every draught of the fresh, untainted mountain  air; nor was it less a delight to sit on the bank of one of the  transparent lakes and eat my luncheon and quaff from a pellucid spring  that gushed as cold as ice and as sweet as nectar from the sand, while  the white-crowned sparrows trilled a serenade in the copses.    Toward evening I clambered down to the cottage by Moraine Lake. The next  morning, in addition to the birds already observed in the valley, I  listened to the theme-like recitative of a warbling vireo, and also  watched a sandpiper teetering about the edge of the water, while a  red-shafted flicker dashed across the lake to a pine tree on the  opposite side. As I left this attractive valley, the hermit thrushes  seemed to waft me a sad farewell.    A little over half a day was spent in walking down from Moraine Lake to  the Halfway House. It was a saunter that shall never be forgotten, for I  gathered a half day's tribute of lore from the birds. A narrow green  hollow, wedging itself into one of the gorges of the towering Peak, and  watered by a snow-fed mountain brook, proved a very paradise for birds.  Here was that queer little midget of the Rockies, the broad-tailed  humming-bird, which performs such wonderful feats of balancing in the  air; the red-shafted flicker; the western robin, singing precisely like  his eastern half-brother; a pair of house-wrens guarding their  treasures; Lincoln's sparrows, not quite so shy as those at Moraine  Lake; mountain chickadees; olive-sided flycatchers; on the pine-clad  mountain sides the lyrical hermit thrushes; and finally those  ballad-singers of the mountain vales, the white-crowned sparrows, one of  whose nests I was so fortunate as to come upon. It was placed in a small  pine bush, and was just in process of construction. One of the birds  flew fiercely at a mischievous chipmunk, and drove him away, as if he  knew him for an arrant nest-robber.    Leaving this enchanting spot, I trudged down the mountain valleys and  ravines, holding silent converse everywhere with the birds, and at  length reached a small park, green and bushy, a short distance above the  Halfway House. While jogging along, my eye caught sight of a gray-headed  junco, which flitted from a clump of bushes bordering the stream to a  spot on the ground close to some shrubs. The act appeared so suggestive  that I decided to reconnoitre. I walked cautiously to the spot where the  bird had dropped down, and in a moment she flew up with a scolding  chipper. There was the nest, set on the ground in the grass and cosily  hidden beneath the over-arching branches of a low bush. Had the mother  bird been wise and courageous enough to retain her place, her secret  would not have been betrayed, the nest was so well concealed.    The pretty couch contained four juvenile juncos covered only with down,  and yet, in spite of their extreme youth, their foreheads and lores  showed black, and their backs a distinctly reddish tint, so early in  life were they adopting the pattern worn by their parents. The  persistency of species in the floral and faunal realms presents some  hard nuts for the evolutionist to crack. But that is an excursus, and  would lead us too far afield. This was the first junco's nest I had ever  found, and no one can blame me for feeling gratified with the  discovery. The gray-headed juncos were very abundant in the Rockies, and  are the only species at present known to breed in the State of Colorado.  They are differentiated from the common slate-colored snowbird by their  ash-gray "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],[0,"The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#8)"],[1,"is by the _interposition of       blue or green glasses_. His first method was to observe the sun       near the horizon; the second was to view him through a transparent       cloud; the third was to look at him through his telescope with a       blue or a green glass of a proper thickness, and plane on both       sides, or to use a thin blue glass when the sun was covered with a       thin vapour or cloud; and the fourth method was to begin and       observe the sun at his margin, till the eye gradually reached the       middle of his disc.    On the publication of Scheiner's letters, Velser transmitted a copy of  them to his friend Galileo, with the request that he would favour him  with his opinion of the new phenomena. After some delay, Galileo  addressed three letters to Velser, in which he combated the opinions of  Scheiner on the cause of the spots. The first of these letters was dated  the 4th of May 1612;[23] but though the controversy was carried on in  the language of mutual respect and esteem, it put an end to the  friendship which had existed between the two astronomers. In these  letters Galileo showed that the spots often dispersed like vapours or  clouds; that they sometimes had a duration of only one or two days, and  at other times of thirty or forty days; that they contracted in their  breadth when they approached the sun's limb, without any diminution of  their length; that they describe circles parallel to each other; that  the monthly rotation of the sun again brings the same spots into view;  and that they are seldom seen at a greater distance than 30 deg. from the  sun's equator. Galileo likewise discovered on the sun's disc _faculae_,  or _luculi_, as they were called, which differ in no respect from the  common ones but in their being brighter than the rest of the sun's  surface.[24]         [23] The original of this letter is in the British Museum.         [24] See Istoria e Dimonstrazioni, intorno alle macchie solare.       _Roma_, 1616. See Opere di Galileo, vol, v., p. 131-293.    In the last of the letters which our author addressed to Velser, and  which was written in December 1612, he recurs to his former discovery of  the elongated shape, or rather the triple structure, of Saturn. The  singular figure which he had observed in this planet had entirely  disappeared; and he evidently announces the fact to Velser, lest it  should be used by his enemies to discredit the accuracy of his  observations. \"Looking on Saturn,\" says he, \"within these few days, I  found it solitary, without the assistance of its accustomed stars, and,  in short, perfectly round and defined like Jupiter; and such it still  remains. Now, what can be said of so strange a metamorphosis? Are the  two smaller stars consumed like the spots on the sun? Have they suddenly  vanished and fled? or has Saturn devoured his own children? or was the  appearance indeed fraud and illusion, with which the glasses have for so  long a time mocked me, and so many others who have often observed with  me? Now, perhaps, the time is come to revive the withering hopes of  those who, guided by more profound contemplations, have followed all the  fallacies of the new observations, and recognised their impossibilities.  I cannot resolve what to say in a chance so strange, so new, and so  unexpected; the shortness of the time, the unexampled occurrence, the  weakness of my intellect, and the terror of being mistaken, have greatly  confounded me.\" Although Galileo struggled to obtain a solution of this  mystery, yet he had not the good fortune to succeed. He imagined that  the two smaller stars would reappear, in consequence of the supposed  revolution of the planet round its axis; but the discovery of the ring  of Saturn, and of the obliquity of its plane to the ecliptic, was  necessary to explain the phenomena which were so perplexing to our  author.    The ill health to which Galileo was occasionally subject, and the belief  that the air of Florence was prejudicial to his complaints, induced him  to spend much of his time at Selve, the villa of his friend Salviati.  This eminent individual had ever been the warmest friend of Galileo, and  seems to have delighted in drawing round him the scientific genius of  the age. He was a member of the celebrated Lyncaean Society, founded by  Prince Frederigo Cesi; and though he is not known as the author of any  important discovery, yet he has earned, by his liberality to science, a  glorious name, which will be indissolubly united with the immortal  destiny of Galileo.    The subject of floating bridges having been discussed at one of the  scientific parties which had assembled at the house of Salviati, a  difference of opinion arose respecting the influence of the shape of  bodies on their disposition to float or to sink in a fluid. Contrary to  the general opinion, Galileo undertook to prove that it depended on  other causes; and he was thus led to compose his discourse on floating  bodies,[25] which was published in 1612, and dedicated to Cosmo de  Medici. This work contains many ingenious experiments, and much acute  reasoning in support of the true principles of hydrostatics; and it is  now chiefly remarkable as a specimen of the sagacity and intellectual  power of its author. Like all his other works, it encountered the most  violent opposition; and Galileo was more than once summoned into the  field to repel the aggressions of his ignorant and presumptuous  opponents. The first attack upon it was made by Ptolemy Nozzolini, in a  letter to Marzemedici, Archbishop of Florence;[26] and to this Galileo  replied in a letter addressed to his antagonist.[27] A more elaborate  examination of it was published by Lodovico delle Colombe, and another  by M. Vincenzo di Grazia. To these attacks, a minute and overwhelming  answer was printed in the name of Benedetti Castelli, the friend and  pupil of Galileo; but it was discovered, some years after Galileo's  death, that he was himself the author of this work.[28]         [25] Discorso intorno alle cose che stanno in su l'acqua, o che in       quella si muovono. Opere di Galileo, vol. ii. pp. 165-311.         [26] Opere di Galileo, vol. ii. pp. 355-367.         [27] Ibid. 367-390.         [28] These three treatises occupy the whole of the third volume of       the Opere di Galileo.          CHAPTER IV.         _Galileo treats his opponents with severity and sarcasm--He is       aided by the sceptics of the day--The Church party the most       powerful--Galileo commences the attack, and is answered by Caccini,       a Dominican--Galileo's Letter to the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, in       support of the motion of the Earth and the stability of the Sun---       Galileo visits Rome--Is summoned before the Inquisition, and       renounces his opinions as heretical--The Inquisition denounces the       Copernican System--Galileo has an audience of the Pope, but still       maintains his opinions in private society--Proposes to find out the       Longitude at Sea by means of Jupiter's Satellites--His negociation       on this subject with the Court of Spain--Its failure--He is unable       to observe the three Comets of 1618, but is involved in the       controversy to which they gave rise._      The current of Galileo's life had hitherto flowed in a smooth and  unobstructed channel. He had now attained the highest objects of earthly  ambition. His discoveries had placed him at the head of the great men of  the age; he possessed a professional income far beyond his wants, and  even beyond his anticipations; and, what is still dearer to a  philosopher, he enjoyed the most perfect leisure for carrying on and  completing his discoveries. The opposition which these discoveries  encountered, was to him more a subject for triumph than for sorrow.  Prejudice and ignorance were his only enemies; and if they succeeded for  a while in harassing his march, it was only to lay a foundation for  fresh achievements. He who contends for truths which he has himself been  permitted to discover, may well sustain the conflict in which  presumption and error are destined to fall. The public tribunal may  neither be sufficiently pure nor enlightened to decide upon the issue;  but he can appeal to posterity, and reckon with confidence on \"its sure  decree.\"    The ardour of Galileo's mind, the keenness of his temper, his clear  perception of truth, and his inextinguishable love of it, combined to  exasperate and prolong the hostility of his enemies. When argument  failed to enlighten their judgment, and reason to dispel their  prejudices, he wielded against them his powerful weapons of ridicule  and sarcasm; and in this unrelenting warfare, he seems to have forgotten  that Providence had withheld from his enemies those very gifts which he  had so liberally received. He who is allowed to take the start of his  species, and to penetrate the veil which conceals from common minds the  mysteries of nature, must not expect that the world will be patiently  dragged at the chariot wheels of his philosophy. Mind has its inertia as  well as matter; and its progress to truth can only be insured by the  gradual and patient removal of the obstructions which surround it.    The boldness--may we not say the recklessness--with which Galileo  insisted upon making proselytes of his enemies, served but to alienate  them from the truth. Errors thus assailed speedily entrench themselves  in general feelings, and become embalmed in the virulence of the  passions. The various classes of his opponents marshalled themselves for  their mutual defence. The Aristotelian professors, the temporising  Jesuits, the political churchmen, and that timid but respectable body  who at all times dread innovation, whether it be in religion or in  science, entered into an alliance against the philosophical tyrant who  threatened them with the penalties of knowledge.    The party of Galileo, though weak in numbers,"]]]
