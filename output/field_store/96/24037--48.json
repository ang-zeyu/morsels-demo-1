The man who has become  blind does not regain his sight; the man who has become bald does not  regain his hair; the man who has lost his teeth does not grow a new  set.    (iv) Statements opposed as affirmation and negation belong  manifestly to a class which is distinct, for in this case, and in this  case only, it is necessary for the one opposite to be true and the  other false.    Neither in the case of contraries, nor in the case of correlatives, nor  in the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', is it necessary for one to  be true and the other false. Health and disease are contraries: neither  of them is true or false. 'Double' and 'half' are opposed to each other  as correlatives: neither of them is true or false. The case is the  same, of course, with regard to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as  'sight' and 'blindness'. In short, where there is no sort of  combination of words, truth and falsity have no place, and all the  opposites we have mentioned so far consist of simple words.    At the same time, when the words which enter into opposed statements  are contraries, these, more than any other set of opposites, would seem  to claim this characteristic. 'Socrates is ill' is the contrary of  'Socrates is well', but not even of such composite expressions is it  true to say that one of the pair must always be true and the other  false. For if Socrates exists, one will be true and the other false,  but if he does not exist, both will be false; for neither 'Socrates is  ill' nor 'Socrates is well' is true, if Socrates does not exist at all.    In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', if the subject does not  exist at all, neither proposition is true, but even if the subject  exists, it is not always the fact that one is true and the other false.  For 'Socrates has sight' is the opposite of 'Socrates is blind' in the  sense of the word 'opposite' which applies to possession and privation.  Now if Socrates exists, it is not necessary that one should be true and  the other false, for when he is not yet able to acquire the power of  vision, both are false, as also if Socrates is altogether non-existent.    But in the case of affirmation and negation, whether the subject exists  or not, one is always false and the other true. For manifestly, if  Socrates exists, one of the two propositions 'Socrates is ill',  'Socrates is not ill', is true, and the other false. This is likewise  the case if he does not exist; for if he does not exist, to say that he  is ill is false, to say that he is not ill is true. Thus it is in the  case of those opposites only, which are opposite in the sense in which  the term is used with reference to affirmation and negation, that the  rule holds good, that one of the pair must be true and the other false.        Part 11    That the contrary of a good is an evil is shown by induction: the  contrary of health is disease, of courage, cowardice, and so on. But  the contrary of an evil is sometimes a good, sometimes an evil. For  defect, which is an evil, has excess for its contrary, this also being  an evil, and the mean, which is a good, is equally the contrary of the  one and of the other. It is only in a few cases, however, that we see  instances of this: in most, the contrary of an evil is a good.    In the case of contraries, it is not always necessary that if one  exists the other should also exist: for if all become healthy there  will be health and no disease, and again, if everything turns white,  there will be white, but no black. Again, since the fact that Socrates  is ill is the contrary of the fact that Socrates is well, and two  contrary conditions cannot both obtain in one and the same individual  at the same time, both these contraries could not exist at once: for if  that Socrates was well was a fact, then that Socrates was ill could not  possibly be one.    It is plain that contrary attributes must needs be present in subjects  which belong to the same species or genus. Disease and health require  as their subject the body of an animal; white and black require a body,  without further qualification; justice and injustice require as their  subject the human soul.    Moreover, it is necessary that pairs of contraries should in all cases  either belong to the same genus or belong to contrary genera or be  themselves genera. White and black belong to the same genus, colour;  justice and injustice, to contrary genera, virtue and vice; while good  and evil do not belong to genera, but are themselves actual genera,  with terms under them.        Part 12    There are four senses in which one thing can be said to be 'prior' to  another. Primarily and most properly the term has reference to time: in  this sense the word is used to indicate that one thing is older or more  ancient than another, for the expressions 'older' and 'more ancient'  imply greater length of time.    Secondly, one thing is said to be 'prior' to another when the sequence  of their being cannot be reversed. In this sense 'one' is 'prior' to  'two'. For if 'two' exists, it follows directly that 'one' must exist,  but if 'one' exists, it does not follow necessarily that 'two' exists:  thus the sequence subsisting cannot be reversed. It is agreed, then,  that when the sequence of two things cannot be reversed, then that one  on which the other depends is called 'prior' to that other.    In the third place, the term 'prior' is used with reference to any  order, as in the case of science and of oratory. For in sciences which  use demonstration there is that which is prior and that which is  posterior in order; in geometry, the elements are prior to the  propositions; in reading and writing, the letters of the alphabet are  prior to the syllables. Similarly, in the case of speeches, the  exordium is prior in order to the narrative.    Besides these senses of the word, there is a fourth. That which is  better and more honourable is said to have a natural priority. In  common parlance men speak of those whom they honour and love as 'coming  first' with them. This sense of the word is perhaps the most  far-fetched.    Such, then, are the different senses in which the term 'prior' is used.    Yet it would seem that besides those mentioned there is yet another.  For in those things, the being of each of which implies that of the  other, that which is in any way the cause may reasonably be said to be  by nature 'prior' to the effect. It is plain that there are instances  of this. The fact of the being of a man carries with it the truth of  the proposition that he is, and the implication is reciprocal: for if a  man is, the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, and  conversely, if the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, then  he is. The true proposition, however, is in no way the cause of the  being of the man, but the fact of the man's being does seem somehow to  be the cause of the truth of the proposition, for the truth or falsity  of the proposition depends on the fact of the man's being or not being.    Thus the word 'prior' may be used in five senses.        Part 13    The term 'simultaneous' is primarily and most appropriately applied to  those things the genesis of the one of which is simultaneous with that  of the other; for in such cases neither is prior or posterior to the  other. Such things are said to be simultaneous in point of time. Those  things, again, are 'simultaneous' in point of nature, the being of each  of which involves that of the other, while at the same time neither is  the cause of the other's being. This is the case with regard to the  double and the half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since, if  there is a double, there is also a half, and if there is a half, there  is also a double, while at the same time neither is the cause of the  being of the other.    Again, those species which are distinguished one from another and  opposed one to another within the same genus are said to be  'simultaneous' in nature. I mean those species which are distinguished  each from each by one and the same method of division. Thus the  'winged' species is simultaneous with the 'terrestrial' and the 'water'  species. These are distinguished within the same genus, and are opposed  each to each, for the genus 'animal' has the 'winged', the  'terrestrial', and the 'water' species, and no one of these is prior or  posterior to another; on the contrary, all such things appear to be  'simultaneous' in nature. Each of these also, the terrestrial, the  winged, and the water species, can be divided again into subspecies.  Those species, then, also will be 'simultaneous' in point of nature,  which, belonging to the same genus, are distinguished each from each by  one and the same method of differentiation.    But genera are prior to species, for the sequence of their being cannot  be reversed. If there is the species 'water-animal', there will be the  genus 'animal', but granted the being of the genus 'animal', it does  not follow necessarily that there will be the species 'water-animal'.    Those things, therefore, are said to be 'simultaneous' in nature, the  being of each of which involves that of the other, while at the same  time neither is in any way the cause of the other's being; those  species, also, which are distinguished each from each and opposed  within the same genus. Those things, moreover, are 'simultaneous' in  the unqualified sense of the word which come into being at the same  time.        Part 14    There are six sorts of movement: generation, destruction, increase,  diminution, alteration, and change of place.    It is evident in all but one case that all these sorts of movement are  distinct each from each. Generation is distinct from destruction,  increase and change of place from diminution, and so on. But in the  case of alteration it may be argued that the process necessarily  implies one or other of the other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#8)"],[1,"Sermons  neatly bound and told her in it we were invited to a wedding.

Madam  Rogers and Madam Leverett much congratulated him, and his daughter  Judith visited her prospective stepmother. But alas! the lady was coy  and averse to a decision:         \"She mentions her Discouragement by reason of Discourse she had       heard. Ask't what I should allow her, she not speaking I told her I       was willing to allow her two hundred and fifty pounds per annum if       it should please God to take me out of the world before her. She       answered she had better keep as she was than give up a certainty       for an uncertainty. She would pay dear for her living in Boston. I       desired her to make Proposals but she made none. I had thought of       Publishment next Thursday. But I now seem far from it. My God who       has the pity of a Father Direct and help me.\"    Mr. Denison's will left his widow a portion of his estate to dispose of  as she wished if she did not marry again. Judge Sewall was unwilling to  make equal provision for her, hence the stumbling block in their  courtship.    After consulting with a friend, the Judge made a final visit to her on  November 28th.         \"She said she thought it was hard to part with all and having       nothing to bestow on her Kindred. I had ask'd her to give me       proposals in Writing and she upbraided me That I who had never       written her a Letter should ask her to write. She asked me if I       would drink, I told her yes. She gave me Cider Aples and a Glass of       Wine, gathered together the little things I had given her and       offered them to me, but I would none of them. Told her I wish'd her       well and should be glad of her welfare. She seem'd to say she       should not again take in hand a thing of this nature. Thank'd me       for what I had given her and Desir'd my Prayers. My bowels yern       towards Mrs. Denison but I think God directs me in his Providence       to desist.\"    This love affair was not, however, quite ended, for the following Lord's  Day \"after dark\" Widow Denison came \"very privat\" to his house. This  Sunday visit betokened great anxiety on her part. She had walked in from  Roxbury in the cold, and when we remember how wolves and bears abounded  in the vicinity we comprehend still further her solicitude.         \"She ask'd pardon if she had affronted me.... Mr. Denison spake to       her after signing his will that he would not make her put all out       of her Hand and power but reserve something to bestow on her       friends that might want.... I could not observe that she made me       any offer all the while. She mentioned two Glass Bottles she had.       I told her they were hers and the other small things I had given       her only now they had not the same signification as before, I was       much concerned for her being in the cold, would fetch her a plate       of something warm; she refused. However I fetched a Tankard of       Cider and drank to her. She desired that nobody might know of her       being here. I told her they should not. She went away in the bitter       Cold, no moon being up, to my great pain. I Saluted her at       Parting.\"    With that parting kiss on that dark cold night, in \"great pain,\" ended  the Judge's second wooing.    That he was sincerely in love with Widow Denison one cannot doubt,  though he loved his money more. Disappointed, he did not again turn to  courting until the following August--much longer than he had waited  after the death of his wife. He then proceeded in a matter-of-fact way  to visit Widow Tilley, whom he had early noted in meeting. He asked her,  at his third visit, to \"come and live in his house.\" \"She expressed her  unworthiness with much respect,\" and both agreed to consider it. He gave  her a little book called \"Ornaments of Sion;\" Mr. Pemberton applauded  his courtship; Mrs. Armitage said that Mrs. Tilley had been a great  blessing to them; the banns were published; and the Judge's third wooing  ended in a marriage on October 24th.    But the bride was very ill on her wedding night, and after several  slight sicknesses through the winter, died on May 20th, to her husband's  \"great amazement.\" Again he was a-seeking a \"dear Yoke fellow,\" and on  September 30th, \"Daughter Sewall acquainted Madam Winthrop that if she  pleased to be within at 3 P.M. I would wait on her.\" This was the same  Madam Winthrop whose attractions had been so completely obscured by the  bright halo which encircled the much-longed-for Widow Denison.         \"Madam Winthrop returning answer that she would be at home, I went       to her house and spake to her saying my loving wife died so soon       and suddenly 'twas hardly convenient for me to think of Marrying       again, however I came to this Resolution that I would not make my       Court to any person without first consulting with her. Had a       pleasant Discourse about Seven Single persons sitting in the       Fore-Seat. She propounded one after another to me but none would       do.\"    Now, I think the Judge was very graceful in approaching a proposal to  this widow, for on his next visit he asked to see her alone, and he  resumed the pleasant discourse about the seven widows on the fore seat,  and said:         \"At last I pray'd Katharine might be the person assigned for me.       She evidently took it up in the way of denyal as if she had catched       at an opportunity to do it, saying she could not do it, could not       leave her children.\"    The Judge begged her not to be so speedy in decision, and brought her  gifts, \"pieces of Mr. Belchar's cake and gingerbread wrapped in a clean  sheet of paper;\" China oranges; the _News Letter_; Preston's \"Church  Marriage;\" sugared almonds (of which she inquired the price). He wrote  her a stilted letter with an allusion in it to Christopher Columbus,  and he had to explain it to her afterward. He gave money to her servants  and \"penys\" to her grandchildren, and heard them \"say their catechise;\"  and he had interviews and consultations with her relatives--her  children, her sister--who agreed not to oppose the marriage.    Still the progress of the courtship was not encouraging. Katharine went  to her neighbors' houses when she knew her suitor was coming to visit  her, and left him to read \"Dr. Sibbs Bowels\" for scant comfort. She  \"look'd dark and lowering\" at him and coldly placed tables or her  grandchild's cradle between her chair and his as they sat together. She  avoided seeing him alone. She \"let the fire come to one short Brand  beside the Block and fall in pieces and make no recruit\"--a broad hint  to leave. She \"would not help him on with his coat\"--a cutting blow. She  would not let her servant accompany him home with a lantern, but  heartlessly permitted her elderly lover to stumble home alone in the  dark. She spoke to him of his luckless courtship of Widow Denison (a  most unpleasant topic), thus giving a clue to the whole situation, in  showing that Madam Winthrop resented his desertion of her in his first  widowerhood, and like Falstaff, would not \"undergo a sneap without  reply.\" He said, in apologetic answer:         \"If after a first and second Vagary she would Accept of me       returning her Victorious Kindness and Good Will would be very       Obliging.\"    Undeterred by these many rebuffs, as she grew cold he waxed warm, and a  most lover-like and gallant scene ensued which would have done credit to  a younger man than the Judge. Here it is in his own words:         \"I asked her to Acquit me of Rudeness if I drew off her Glove.       Enquiring the reason I told her 'twas great odds between handling a       dead Goat and a Living Lady. Got it off.... Told her the reason why       I came every other night was lest I should drink too Deep draughts       of Pleasure. She had talked of Canary, her Kisses were to me better       than the best Canary.\"    Naturally these warm words had a marked effect; she relaxed, drank a  glass of wine with him, and I trust gave him a Canary-sweet kiss, and  sent a servant home with him with a lantern.    The next visit the wind blew cold again. He had had one experience with  a short-lived wife, and he had determined that should his next wife die  he would still have some positive benefit from having married her. Hence  he kept pressing Madam Winthrop in a most unpleasant and ghoulish manner  to know what she would give him in case she died. He would allow her but  one hundred pounds per annum. She in turn persisted in questioning him  about the property he had given to his children; and she wished him to  agree to keep a coach (which he could well afford to do), and she wanted  it set on springs too. He said he could not do it while he paid his  debts. She also suggested that he should wear a wig. This annoyed him  beyond measure, for he hated with extreme Puritan intenseness those  \"horrid Bushes of Vanity,\" and the suggestion from his would-be bride  was irritating in the extreme. He answered her with much self-control:         \"As to a Periwigg my best and Greatest Friend begun to find me with       Hair before I was born and has continued to do so ever since and I       could not find it in my heart to go to another.\"    Still, when nearly all the men of dignity and position in the colony  wore imposing stately wigs, no woman would be pleased to have a"]]]
