It is, however, _necessary_. In no other way can the ultimate  triumph of Civilization be assured.\"    \"But can nothing be done to alleviate...?\" Eukonidor paused.    Drounli waited. \"Have you any suggestions to offer?\"    \"None,\" the younger Arisian confessed. \"But I thought ... you, or the  Elders, so much older and stronger ... could....\"    \"We can not. Rome will fall. It must be allowed to fall.\"    \"It will be Nero, then? And we can do nothing?\"    \"Nero. We can do little enough. Our forms of flesh--Petronius, Acte, and  the others--will do whatever they can; but their powers will be exactly  the same as those of other human beings of their time. They must be and  will be constrained, since any show of unusual powers, either mental or  physical, would be detected instantly and would be far too revealing. On  the other hand, Nero--that is, Gharlane of Eddore--will be operating  much more freely.\"    \"Very much so. Practically unhampered, except in purely physical  matters. But, if nothing can be done to stop it.... If Nero must be  allowed to sow his seeds of ruin....\"    And upon that cheerless note the conference ended.      3. ROME    \"But what have you, Livius, or any of us, for that matter, got to live  for?\" demanded Patroclus the gladiator of his cell-mate. \"We are well  fed, well kept, well exercised; like horses. But, like horses, we are  lower than slaves. Slaves have some freedom of action; most of us have  none. We fight--fight whoever or whatever our cursed owners send us  against. Those of us who live fight again; but the end is certain and  comes soon. I had a wife and children once. So did you. Is there any  chance, however slight, that either of us will ever know them again; or  learn even whether they live or die? None. At this price, is your life  worth living? Mine is not.\"    Livius the Bithynian, who had been staring out past the bars of the  cubicle and over the smooth sand of the arena toward Nero's garlanded  and purple-bannered throne, turned and studied his fellow gladiator from  toe to crown. The heavily-muscled legs, the narrow waist, the  sharply-tapering torso, the enormous shoulders. The leonine head,  surmounted by an unkempt shock of red-bronze-auburn hair. And, lastly,  the eyes--gold-flecked, tawny eyes--hard and cold now with a ferocity  and a purpose not to be concealed.    \"I have been more or less expecting something of this sort,\" Livius said  then, quietly. \"Nothing overt--you have builded well, Patroclus--but to  one who knows gladiators as I know them there has been something in the  wind for weeks past. I take it that someone swore his life for me and  that I should not ask who that friend might be.\"    \"One did. You should not.\"    \"So be it. To my unknown sponsor, then, and to the gods, I give thanks,  for I am wholly with you. Not that I have any hope. Although your tribe  breeds men--from your build and hair and eyes you descend from  Spartacus himself--you know that even he did not succeed. Things now are  worse, infinitely worse, than they were in his day. No one who has ever  plotted against Nero has had any measure of success; not even his  scheming slut of a mother. All have died, in what fashions you know.  Nero is vile, the basest of the base. Nevertheless, his spies are the  most efficient that the world has ever known. In spite of that, I feel  as you do. If I can take with me two or three of the Praetorians, I die  content. But by your look, your plan is not what I thought, to storm  vainly Nero's podium yonder. Have you, by any chance, some trace of hope  of success?\"    \"More than a trace; much more.\" The Thracian's teeth bared in a wolfish  grin. \"His spies are, as you say, very good. But, this time, so are we.  Just as hard and just as ruthless. Many of his spies among us have died;  most, if not all, of the rest are known. They, too, shall die. Glatius,  for instance. Once in a while, by the luck of the gods, a man kills a  better man than he is; but Glatius has done it six times in a row,  without getting a scratch. But the next time he fights, in spite of  Nero's protection, Glatius dies. Word has gone out, and there are  gladiators' tricks that Nero never heard of.\"    \"Quite true. One question, and I too may begin to hope. This is not the  first time that gladiators have plotted against Ahenobarbus. Before the  plotters could accomplish anything, however, they found themselves  matched against each other and the signal was always for death, never  for mercy. Has this...?\" Livius paused.    \"It has not. It is that which gives me the hope I have. Nor are we  gladiators alone in this. We have powerful friends at court; one of whom  has for days been carrying a knife sharpened especially to slip between  Nero's ribs. That he still carries that knife and that we still live are  proofs enough for me that Ahenobarbus, the matricide and incendiary, has  no suspicion whatever of what is going on.\"    (At this point Nero on his throne burst into a roar of laughter, his  gross body shaking with a merriment which Petronius and Tigellinus  ascribed to the death-throes of a Christian woman in the arena.)    \"Is there any small thing which I should be told in order to be of  greatest use?\" Livius asked.    \"Several. The prisons and the pits are so crowded with Christians that  they die and stink, and a pestilence threatens. To mend matters, some  scores of hundreds of them are to be crucified here tomorrow.\"    \"Why not? Everyone knows that they are poisoners of wells and murderers  of children, and practitioners of magic. Wizards and witches.\"    \"True enough.\" Patroclus shrugged his massive shoulders. \"But to get on,  tomorrow night, at full dark, the remaining hundreds who have not been  crucified are to be--have you ever seen sarmentitii and semaxii?\"    \"Once only. A gorgeous spectacle, truly, almost as thrilling as to feel  a man die on your sword. Men and women, wrapped in oil-soaked garments  smeared with pitch and chained to posts, make splendid torches indeed.  You mean, then, that...?\"    \"Aye. In Caesar's own garden. When the light is brightest Nero will ride  in parade. When his chariot passes the tenth torch our ally swings his  knife. The Praetorians will rush around, but there will be a few moments  of confusion during which we will go into action and the guards will  die. At the same time others of our party will take the palace and kill  every man, woman, and child adherent to Nero.\"    \"Very nice--in theory.\" The Bithynian was frankly skeptical. \"But just  how are we going to get there? A few gladiators--such champions as  Patroclus of Thrace--are at times allowed to do pretty much as they  please in their free time, and hence could possibly be on hand to take  part in such a brawl, but most of us will be under lock and guard.\"    \"That too, has been arranged. Our allies near the throne and certain  other nobles and citizens of Rome, who have been winning large sums by  our victories, have prevailed upon our masters to give a grand banquet  to _all_ gladiators tomorrow night, immediately following the mass  crucifixion. It is going to be held in the Claudian Grove, just across  from Caesar's Gardens.\"    \"Ah!\" Livius breathed deep; his eyes flashed. \"By Baal and Bacchus! By  the round, high breasts of Isis! For the first time in years I begin to  live! Our masters die first, then and there ... but hold--weapons?\"    \"Will be provided. Bystanders will have them, and armor and shields,  under their cloaks. Our owners first, yes; and then the Praetorians. But  note, Livius, that Tigellinus, the Commander of the Guard, is mine--mine  alone. I, personally, am going to cut his heart out.\"    \"Granted. I heard that he had your wife for a time. But you seem quite  confident that you will still be alive tomorrow night. By Baal and  Ishtar, I wish I could feel so! With something to live for at last, I  can feel my guts turning to water--I can hear Charon's oars. Like as  not, now, some toe-dancing stripling of a retiarius will entangle me in  his net this very afternoon, and no mercy signal has been or will be  given this day. Such is the crowd's temper, from Caesar down, that even  you will get 'Pollice verso' if you fall.\"    \"True enough. But you had better get over that feeling, if you want to  live. As for me, I'm safe enough. I have made a vow to Jupiter, and he  who has protected me so long will not desert me now. Any man or any  thing who faces me during these games, dies.\"    \"I hope so, sin ... but listen! The horns ... and someone is coming!\"    The door behind them swung open. A lanista, or master of gladiators,  laden with arms and armor, entered. The door swung to and was locked  from the outside. The visitor was obviously excited, but stared  wordlessly at Patroclus for seconds.    \"Well, Iron-heart,\" he burst out finally, \"aren't you even curious about  what you have got to do today?\"    \"Not particularly,\" Patroclus replied, indifferently. \"Except to dress  to fit. Why? Something special?\"    \"_Extra_ special. The sensation of the year. Fermius himself. Unlimited.  Free choice of weapons and armor.\"    \"Fermius!\" Livius exclaimed. \"Fermius the Gaul? May Athene cover you  with her shield!\"    \"You can say that for me, too,\" the lanista agreed, callously. \"Before I  knew who was entered, like a fool, I bet a hundred sesterces on  Patroclus here, at odds of only one to two, against "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3284"],[0,"The Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#8)"],[1," fairly appointed to his place. The process of  camp-forming would be thus: Sheikh Said, with Bombay under him, issues  cloths to the men for rations at the rate of one-fourth load a-day  (about 15 lb.) amongst 165; the Hottentots cook our dinners and their  own, or else lie rolling on the ground overcome with fatigue;  the Beluchs are supposed to guard the camp, but prefer gossip and  brightening their arms. Some men are told off to look after the mules,  donkeys, and goats, whilst out grazing; the rest have to pack the kit,  pitch our tents, cut boughs for huts, and for fencing in the camp--a  thing rarely done, by-the-by. After cooking, when the night has set  it, the everlasting dance begins, attended with clapping of hands and  jingling small bells strapped to the legs--the whole being accompanied  by a constant repetition of senseless words, which stand in place of  the song to the negroes; for song they have none, being mentally  incapacitated for musical composition, though as timists they are not to  be surpassed.    What remains to be told is the daily occupation of Captain Grant,  myself, and our private servants. Beginning at the foot: Rahan, a very  peppery little negro, who had served in a British man-of-war at the  taking of Rangoon, was my valet; and Baraka, who had been trained much  in the same manner, but had seen engagements at Multan, was Captain  Grant's. They both knew Hindustani; but while Rahan's services at  sea had been short, Baraka had served nearly all his life with  Englishmen--was the smartest and most intelligent negro I ever saw--was  invaluable to Colonel Rigby as a detector of slave-traders, and enjoyed  his confidence completely--so much so, that he said, on parting with  him, that he did not know where he should be able to find another man  to fill his post. These two men had now charge of our tents and personal  kit, while Baraka was considered the general of the Wanguana forces, and  Rahan a captain of ten.    My first occupation was to map the country. This is done by timing the  rate of march with a watch, taking compass-bearings along the road, or  on any conspicuous marks--as, for instance, hills off it--and by noting  the watershed--in short, all topographical objects. On arrival in  camp every day came the ascertaining, by boiling a thermometer, of the  altitude of the station above the sea-level; of the latitude of the  station by the meridian altitude of the star taken with a sextant; and  of the compass variation by azimuth. Occasionally there was the fixing  of certain crucial stations, at intervals of sixty miles or so, by  lunar observations, or distances of the moon either from the sun or  from certain given stars, for determining the longitude, by which the  original-timed course can be drawn out with certainty on the map by  proportion. Should a date be lost, you can always discover it by taking  a lunar distance and comparing it with the Nautical Almanac, by noting  the time when a star passes the meridian if your watch is right, or by  observing the phases of the moon, or her rising or setting, as compared  with the Nautical Almanac. The rest of my work, besides sketching and  keeping a diary, which was the most troublesome of all, consisted in  making geological and zoological collections. With Captain Grant rested  the botanical collections and thermometrical registers. He also  boiled one of the thermometers, kept the rain-gauge, and undertook the  photography; but after a time I sent the instruments back, considering  this work too severe for the climate, and he tried instead sketching  with watercolours--the results of which form the chief part of the  illustrations in this book. The rest of our day went in breakfasting  after the march was over--a pipe, to prepare us for rummaging the fields  and villages to discover their contents for scientific purposes--dinner  close to sunset, and tea and pipe before turning in at night.    A short stage brought us to Ikamburu, included in the district of Nzasa,  where there is another small village presided over by Phanze Khombe la  Simba, meaning Claw of Lion. He, immediately after our arrival, sent us  a present of a basket of rice, value one dollar, of course expecting  a return--for absolute generosity is a thing unknown to the negro. Not  being aware of the value of the offering, I simply requested the Sheikh  to give him four yards of American sheeting, and thought no more about  the matter, until presently I found the cloth returned. The \"Sultan\"  could not think of receiving such a paltry present from me, when on the  former journey he got so much; if he showed this cloth at home, nobody  would believe him, but would say he took much more and concealed it from  his family, wishing to keep all his goods to himself. I answered that my  footing in the country had been paid for on the last journey, and unless  he would accept me as any other common traveller, he had better walk  away; but the little Sheikh, a timid, though very gentlemanly creature,  knowing the man, and dreading the consequences of too high a tone,  pleaded for him, and proposed as a fitting hongo, one dubuani, one  sahari, and eight yards merikani, as the American sheeting is called  here. This was pressed by the jemadar, and acceded to by myself, as the  very utmost I could afford. Lion's Claw, however, would not accept it;  it was too far below the mark of what he got last time. He therefore  returned the cloths to the Sheikh, as he could get no hearing from  myself, and retreated in high dudgeon, threatening the caravan with  a view of his terrible presence on the morrow. Meanwhile the little  Sheikh, who always carried a sword fully two-thirds the length of  himself, commenced casting bullets for his double-barrelled rifle,  ordered the Wanguana to load their guns, and came wheedling up to me for  one more cloth, as it was no use hazarding the expedition's safety for  four yards of cloth. This is a fair specimen of tax-gathering, within  twelve miles of the coast, by a native who claims the protection of  Zanzibar. We shall soon see what they are further on. The result of  experience is, that, ardent as the traveller is to see the interior  of Africa, no sooner has he dealings with the natives, than his whole  thoughts tend to discovering some road where he won't be molested, or a  short cut, but long march, to get over the ground.    Quite undisturbed, we packed and marched as usual, and soon passed Nzasa  close to the river, which is only indicated by a line of trees running  through a rich alluvial valley. We camped at the little settlement of  Kizoto, inhospitably presided over by Phanze Mukia ya Nyani or Monkey's  Tail, who no sooner heard of our arrival than he sent a demand for his  \"rights.\" One dubani was issued, with orders than no one need approach  me again, unless he wanted to smell my powder. Two taxes in five miles  was a thing unheard of; and I heard no more about the matter, until  Bombay in the evening told me how Sheikh Said, fearing awkward  consequences, had settled to give two dubuani, one being taken from  his own store. Lion's Claw also turned up again, getting his cloths of  yesterday--one more being added from the Sheikh's stores--and he was  then advised to go off quietly, as I was a fire-eater whom nobody dared  approach after my orders had been issued. This was our third march in  Uzaramo; we had scarcely seen a man of the country, and had no excessive  desire to do so.    Deflecting from the serpentine course of the Kingani a little, we  crossed a small bitter rivulet, and entered on the elevated cultivation  of Kiranga Ranga, under Phanze Mkungu-pare, a very mild man, who,  wishing to give no offence, begged for a trifling present. He came in  person, and his manner having pleased us, I have him one sahari, four  yards merikani, and eight yards kiniki, which pleased our friend so much  that he begged us to consider his estate our own, even to the extent of  administering his justice, should any Mzaramo be detected stealing from  us. Our target-practice, whilst instructing the men, astonished him not  a little, and produced an exclamation that, with so many guns, we need  fear nothing, go where we would. From this place a good view is obtained  of Uzegura. Beyond the flat alluvial valley of the Kingani, seven to  eight miles broad, the land rises suddenly to a table-land of no great  height, on which trees grow in profusion. In fact it appeared, as far as  the eye could reach, the very counterpart of that where we stood, with  the exception of a small hill, very distant, called Phongue.    A very welcome packet of quinine and other medicines reached us here  from Rigby, who, hearing our complaints that the Hottentots could  only be kept alive by daily potions of brandy and quinine, feared our  supplies were not enough, and sent us more.    We could not get the Sultan's men to chum with the Wanguana proper; they  were shy, like wild animals--built their huts by themselves--and ate and  talked by themselves, for they felt themselves inferiors; and I had  to nominate one of their number to be their chief, answerable for the  actions of the whole. Being in the position of \"boots\" to the camp,  the tending of goats fell to their lot. Three goats were missing this  evening, which the goatherds could not account for, nor any of their  men. Suspecting that they were hidden for a private feast, I told their  chief to inquire farther, and report. The upshot was, that the man was  thrashed for intermeddling, and came back only with his scars. This was  a nice sort of insubordination, which of course could not be endured.  The goatherd was pinioned and brought to trial, for the double  offence of losing the goats and rough-handling his chief. The tricking  scoundrel--on quietly saying he could not be answerable for other men's  actions if they stole goats, and he could not recognise a man as his  chief whom the"]]]
