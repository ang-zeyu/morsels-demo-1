He was made Duke of  Norfolk for his splendid victory over the Scots at Flodden, and Anne  Boleyn and Catherine Howard were his granddaughters. Among the 'othyr  lerninges vertuous' taught him at Edward's court was no doubt that of  drawing, for we find that 'He was buried with much pomp at Thetford  Abbey under a tomb designed by himself and master Clarke, master of the  works at King's College, Cambridge, & Wassel a freemason of Bury S.

[Headnote: RICH MEN'S EDUCATION IN EARLY ENGLAND.]    The question of the social rank of these Bele Babees,[[6a]] children,  and _Pueri_ who stood at tables, opens up the whole subject of  upper-class education in early times in England. It is a subject that,  so far as I can find, has never yet been separately treated[7], and I  therefore throw together such few notices as the kindness of friends[8]  and my own chance grubbings have collected; these as a sort of stopgap  till the appearance of Mr Anstey's volume on early Oxford Studies in the  _Chronicles and Memorials_, a volume which will, I trust, give us a  complete account of early education in our land. If it should not,  I hope that Mr Quick will carry his pedagogic researches past Henry  VIII.'s time, or that one of our own members will take the subject up.  It is worthy of being thoroughly worked out. For convenience' sake, the  notices I have mentioned are arranged under six heads:      1. Education in Nobles' houses.    2. At Home and at Private Tutors', p. xvii. (Girls, p. xxv.)    3. At English Universities, p. xxvi.    4. At Foreign Universities, p. xl.    5. At Monastic and Cathedral Schools, p. xli.    6. At Grammar Schools, p. lii.    One consideration should be premised, that manly exercises, manners and  courtesy, music and singing, knowledge of the order of precedency of  ranks, and ability to carve, were in early times more important than  Latin and Philosophy. 'Aylmar þe kyng' gives these directions to  Athelbrus, his steward, as to Horn's education:        Stiwarde, tak nu here      Mi fundlyng for to lere                              228      Of þine meste{re},      Of wude {and} of riuere;      {And} tech him to harpe      Wiþ his nayles scharpe;                              232      Biuore me to kerue,      And of þe cupe serue;      Þu tech him of alle þe liste (craft, AS. _list_)      Þat þu eure of wiste;                                236      [And] his feiren þou wise (mates thou teach)      Into oþere s{er}uise.

Music  alone.[[10a]] That, as Harrison says, was one of the Quadrivials,  'arithmetike, musike, geometrie, and astronomie.' The Trivium was  grammar, rhetoric, and logic.        [Headnote: HOUSES OF NOBLES AND CHANCELLORS WERE SCHOOLS.]    1. The chief places of education for the sons of our nobility and gentry  were the houses of other nobles, and specially those of the Chancellors  of our Kings, men not only able to read and write, talk Latin and French  themselves, but in whose hands the Court patronage lay. As early as  Henry the Second's time (A.D. 1154-62), if not before[11], this system  prevailed. A friend notes that Fitz-Stephen says of Becket:      \"The nobles of the realm of England and of neighbouring kingdoms    used to send their sons to serve the Chancellor, whom he trained    with honourable bringing-up and learning; and when they had    received the knight's belt, sent them back with honour to their    fathers and kindred: some he used to keep. The king himself, his    master, entrusted to him his son, the heir of the realm, to be    brought up; whom he had with him, with many sons of nobles of the    same age, and their proper retinue and masters and proper servants    in the honour due.\" --_Vita S. Thomæ_, pp. 189, 190, ed. Giles.    Roger de Hoveden, a Yorkshireman, who was a clerk or secretary to Henry  the Second, says of Richard the Lionheart's unpopular chancellor,  Longchamps the Bishop of Ely:      \"All the sons of the nobles acted as his servants, with downcast    looks, nor dared they to look upward towards the heavens unless it    so happened that they were addressing him; and if they attended to    anything else they were pricked with a goad, which their lord held    in his hand, fully mindful of his grandfather of pious memory,    who, being of servile condition in the district of Beauvais, had,    for his occupation, to guide the plough and whip up the oxen; and    who at length, to gain his liberty, fled to the Norman territory.\"    (Riley's _Hoveden_, ii. 232, quoted in _The Cornhill Magazine_,    vol. xv. p. 165.)[12]    All Chancellors were not brutes of this kind, but we must remember that  young people were subjected to rough treatment in early days. Even so  late as Henry VI.'s time, Agnes Paston sends to London on the 28th of  January, 1457, to pray the master of her son of 15, that if the boy  \"hath not done well, nor will not amend,\" his master Greenfield \"will  truly belash him till he will amend.\" And of the same lady's treatment  of her marriageable daughter, Elizabeth, Clere writes on the 29th of  June, 1454,      \"She (the daughter) was never in so great sorrow as she is    now-a-days, for she may not speak with no man, whosoever come, ne    not may see nor speak with my man, nor with servants of her    mother's, but that she beareth her on hand otherwise than she    meaneth; and she hath since Easter the most part been beaten once    in the week or twice, and sometimes twice on a day, and her head    broken in two or three places.\" (v. i. p. 50, col. 1, ed. 1840.)    The treatment of Lady Jane Grey by her parents was also very severe, as  she told Ascham, though she took it meekly, as her sweet nature was:      \"One of the greatest benefites that God ever gave me, is, that he    sent me so sharpe and severe Parentes, and so jentle a    scholemaster. For when I am in presence either of father or    mother, whether I speake, kepe silence, sit, stand, or go, eate,    drinke, be merie or sad, be sewyng, plaiyng, dauncing, or doing    anie thing els, I must do it, as it were, in soch weight, mesure,    and number, even so perfitelie as God made the world, or els I am    so sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened; yea presentlie some    tymes, with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies which I    will not name for the honor I beare them, so without measure    misordered, that I thinke my self in hell till tyme cum that I    must go to _M. Elmer_, who teacheth me so jentlie, so pleasantlie,    with soch faire allurementes to learning, that I thinke all the    tyme nothing whiles I am with him. And when I am called from him,    I fall on weeping.\" --_The Scholemaster_, ed. Mayor.    The inordinate beating[13] of boys by schoolmasters--whom he calls in  different places 'sharp, fond, & lewd'[14]--Ascham denounces strongly in  the first book of his _Scholemaster_, and he contrasts their folly in  beating into their scholars the hatred of learning with the practice of  the wise riders who by gentle allurements breed them up in the love of  riding. Indeed, the origin of his book was Sir Wm. Cecil's saying to him  \"I have strange news brought me this morning, that divers scholars of  Eton be run away from the school for fear of beating.\"    Sir Peter Carew, says Mr Froude, being rather a troublesome boy, was  chained in the Haccombe dog-kennel till he ran away from it.        [Headnote: BP. GROSSETETE TAUGHT NOBLES' SONS.]    But to return to the training of young men in nobles' houses. I take the  following from Fiddes's Appendix to his Life of Wolsey:      _John de Athon_, upon the Constitutions of _Othobon, tit._ 23, in    respect to the Goods of such who dyed intestate, and upon the Word    _Barones_, has the following Passage concerning _Grodsted_ Bishop    of _Lincoln_[15] (who died 9th Oct., 1253),--      \"Robert surnamed Grodsted of holy memory, late Bishop of Lincoln,    when King Henry asked him, as if in wonder, where he learnt the    Nurture in which he had instructed the sons of nobles (&) peers of    the Realm, whom he kept about him as pages    (_domisellos_[16]),--since he was not descended from a noble    lineage, but from humble (parents)--is said to have answered    fearlessly, 'In the house or guest-chambers of greater kings than    the King of England'; because he had learnt from understanding the    scriptures the manner of life of David, Solomon, & other    Kings[15].\"      _Reyner,_ in his _Apostol.

May all the gods make you  happy!\"    Harald led his bride to the horse and lifted her up and set her behind  his saddle and said:    \"Now this Gyda is my wife.\"    Then they drank the stirrup-horn and rode off.    \"Everything comes to King Harald,\" his men said; \"wife and land and  crown and victory in battle. He is a lucky man.\"    [Decoration]          [Illustration]    King Harald Goes West-Over-Seas      Now many men hated King Harald. Many a man said:    \"Why should he put himself up for king of all of us? He is no better  than I am. Am I not a king's son as well as he? And are not many of us  kings' sons? I will not kneel before him and promise to be his man. I  will not pay him taxes. I will not have his earl sitting over me. The  good old days have gone. This Norway has become a prison. I will go away  and find some other place.\"    So hundreds of men sailed away. Some went to France and got land and  lived there. Big Rolf-go-afoot and all his men sailed up the great  French River and won a battle against the French king himself. There was  no way to stop the flashing of his battle-axes but to give him what he  wanted. So the king made Rolf a duke, gave him broad lands and gave him  the king's own daughter for wife. Rolf called his country Normandy, for  old Norway. He ruled it well and was a great lord, and his sons' sons  after him were kings of England.    Other Norsemen went to Ireland and England and Scotland. They drew up  their boats on the river banks. The people ran away before them and  gathered into great armies that marched back to meet the vikings in  battle. Sometimes the Norsemen lost, but oftener they won, so that they  got land and lived in those countries. Their houses sat in these strange  lands like warriors' camps, and the Norsemen went among their new  neighbors with hanging swords and spears in hand, ever ready for fight.    There are many islands north of Scotland. They are called the Orkneys  and the Shetlands. They have many good harbors for ships. They are  little and rocky and bare of trees. Wild sea-birds scream around them.  On some of them a man can stand in the middle and see the ocean all  about him. Now the vikings sailed to these islands and were pleased.    [Illustration: \"_In Norway they left burning houses and weeping  women_\"]    \"It is like being always in a boat,\" they said. \"This shall be our  home.\"    So it went until all the lands round about were covered with vikings.  Norse carved and painted houses brightened the hillsides. Viking ships  sailed all the seas and made harbor in every river. Norsemen's thralls  plowed the soil and planted crops and herded cattle, and gold flowed  into their masters' treasure-chests. Norse warriors walked up and down  the land, and no man dared to say them nay.    These men did not forget Norway. In the summers they sailed back there  and harried the coast. They took gold and grain and beautiful cloth back  to their homes. In Norway they left burning houses and weeping women.    Every summer King Harald had out his ships and men and hunted these  vikings. There are many little islands about Norway. They have crags and  caves and deep woods. Here the vikings hid when they saw King Harald's  ships coming. But Harald ran his boat into every creek and fiord and  hunted in every cave and through all the woods and among the crags. He  caught many men, but most of them got away and went home laughing at  Harald. Then they came back the next summer and did the same deeds over  again. At last King Harald said:    \"There is but one thing to do. I must sail to these western islands and  whip these robbers in their own homes.\"    So he went with a great number of ships. He found as brave men as he had  brought from Norway. These vikings had brought their old courage to  their new homes. King Harald's fine ships were scarred by viking stones  and scorched by viking fire. The shields of Harald's warriors had dents  from viking blows. Many of those men carried viking scars all their  lives. And many of King Harald's warriors walked the long, hard road to  Valhalla, and feasted there with some of these very vikings that had  died in King Harald's battles. But after many hard fights on land and  sea, after many men had died and many had fled away to other lands, King  Harald won, and he made the men that were yet in the islands take the  oath, and he left his earls to rule over them. Then he went back to  Norway.    \"He has done more than he vowed to do,\" people said. \"He has not only  whipped the vikings, but he has got a new kingdom west-over-seas.\"    Then they talked of that dream that his mother had.    \"King Harald was that great tree,\" they said. \"The trunk was red with  the blood of his many battles, but higher up the limbs were fair and  green like this good time of peace. The topmost branches were white  because Harald will live to be an old man. Just as that tree spread out  until all of Norway was in its shade, and even more lands, so Harald is  king of all this country and of the western islands. The many branches  of that tree are the many sons of Harald, who shall be earls and kings  in Norway, and their sons after them, for hundreds of years.\"          _PART II_    [Illustration]    WEST-OVER-SEAS      [Decoration]          [Illustration]    Homes in Iceland      Men had been feasting in Ingolf's house. But there was no laughing and  no shouting of jokes. Ingolf sat in his high seat frowning and gloomy.  His head hung on his breast. He was staring into the fire. Now he raised  his head and looked about the hall.    \"Comrades,\" he said, \"what shall we do? Herstein and Holmstein died by  our swords. Their kinsmen hunger to kill us. Besides, when Harald hears  of our deed, there will not be a safe place in Norway for us. He will  never let a man fight out an honest quarrel. Where shall we go?\"    A man stood up from the bench.    \"We have friends in the Shetlands,\" he said. \"Let us find homes there.\"    Then Leif, in the high seat opposite Ingolf, stood up.    \"No, not the Shetlands, my foster-brother.[10] They are crowded  already. Besides, Harald will not long keep his hands off them. Then  they will be no better than Norway. England and Ireland and Scotland are  old. My eyes ache for something new. What of that far island that Floki  found? It is empty. We could choose our land from the whole country.  There is good fishing. There are green valleys. And Butter Thorolf says  that butter drops from every weed. There are mountains and deserts where  we may find adventure. I say, let us steer for Iceland!\"    When he stopped, many of the men shouted:    \"Yes! Iceland!\"    But an old man stood up.    \"We have all laughed at that tale of Butter Thorolf's,\" he said. \"But  Floki himself said that the sea about the island is full of ice that  pushes upon the land, that no ship can live in that water in the winter,  that great mountains of ice cover the island. Did not all his cattle die  there of hunger and cold, and did he not come back to Norway cursing  Iceland?\"    \"Oh, Sighvat, you are old and fearful,\" called out Leif, and he laughed.    Then he stretched himself up and threw back his head.    \"Are we afraid of ice? Have we not seen angry water before? I have been  hungry, but I have never died of it. Surely if there are fish in the sea  and grass in the valleys, we can live there. I should like to stand on a  hill and look around on a wide land and think, 'This is all ours,' and  out upon a rough sea and think, 'Far off there are our foes and they  dare not come over to us.' Besides, we shall have no Shockhead Harald to  lord it over us. We can come and go and feast and fight as we please. We  shall be our own kings. And our ships will be always waiting to take us  away, when we are weary of it. And we shall see things that other men  have never seen. I am tired of the old things. Perhaps in after days men  will make songs about 'those foster-brothers, Ingolf and Leif, who made  a new country in a wonderful land, and whose sons and grandsons are  mighty men in Iceland!'\"    Ingolf leaped up from his chair.    \"By the strong arm of Thor!\" he cried, \"I like the sound of it. Now I  make my vow.\"    He raised his drinking-horn.    \"I vow that I will find this Iceland and pass the winter there, and that  if man can live upon it I will go back there and set up my home.\"    \"And I vow that I will follow my foster-brother,\" cried Leif.    And many men vowed to go.    So on the next day they began to make ready a boat. They looked her over  carefully and recalked every seam and freshly painted her and put into  her their strongest oars and made her a new sail.    \"This will be the longest voyage that she ever made,\" Ingolf said.    When the work was done, they put into her great stores, axes, hammers,  fish-nets, cooking-kettles, kegs of ale, chests of hard bread, chests of  smoked meat, brass kettles full of flour, skin bottles of water. They  stowed these things away in the ends of the ship. When they were ready  they put in four head of cattle.    \"We shall need the milk and perhaps the meat,\" Ingolf said.    Many men wished to go, but Ingolf had said:    \"There is little room to spare and little food and drink. I have planned  for half a year. But perhaps we must be sailing longer than that. Our  food may run short. We must not have extra mouths to feed. There are  thirty oars in our boat. I will take only one man for every oar, and  Leif and I will steer.\"    So they started off. Leif stood in the prow leaning forward and looking  far ahead, and he sang:        \"What does the swimming dragon smell?      A stormy sea, an empty land,      Hunger, darkness, giants, fire.      Leif and his sword do laugh at that.\"    They sailed for days and saw no land. Sometimes they passed ships and  always made sure to sail"]]]
