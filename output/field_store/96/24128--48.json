But this view is not correct;  for we can show that the sun is certainly not a solid body in so far at  least as its superficial parts are concerned.    A general view of the sun as shown by a telescope of moderate dimensions  may be seen in Fig. 11, which is taken from a photograph obtained by Mr.  Rutherford at New York on the 22nd of September, 1870. It is at once  seen that the surface of the luminary is by no means of uniform texture  or brightness. It may rather be described as granulated or mottled. This  appearance is due to the luminous clouds which float suspended in a  somewhat less luminous layer of gas. It is needless to say that these  solar clouds are very different from the clouds which we know so well in  our own atmosphere. Terrestrial clouds are, of course, formed from  minute drops of water, while the clouds at the surface of the sun are  composed of drops of one or more chemical elements at an exceedingly  high temperature.    The granulated appearance of the solar surface is beautifully shown in  the remarkable photographs on a large scale which M. Janssen, of Meudon,  has succeeded in obtaining during the last twenty years. We are enabled  to reproduce one of them in Fig. 12. It will be observed that the  interstices between the luminous dots are of a greyish tint, the general  effect (as remarked by Professor Young) being much like that of rough  drawing paper seen from a little distance. We often notice places over  the surface of such a plate where the definition seems to be  unsatisfactory. These are not, however, the blemishes that might at  first be supposed. They arise neither from casual imperfections of the  photographic plate nor from accidents during the development; they  plainly owe their origin to some veritable cause in the sun itself, nor  shall we find it hard to explain what that cause must be. As we shall  have occasion to mention further on, the velocities with which the  glowing gases on the sun are animated must be exceedingly great. Even in  the hundredth part of a second (which is about the duration of the  exposure of this plate) the movements of the solar clouds are  sufficiently great to produce the observed indistinctness.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Photograph of the Solar Surface. (_By  Janssen._)]    Irregularly dispersed over the solar surface small dark objects called  sun-spots are generally visible. These spots vary greatly both as to  size and as to number. Sun-spots were first noticed in the beginning of  the seventeenth century, shortly after the invention of the telescope.  Their general appearance is shown in Fig. 13, in which the dark central  nucleus appears in sharp contrast with the lighter margin or penumbra.  Fig. 16 shows a small spot developing out of one of the pores or  interstices between the granules.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--An Ordinary Sun-spot.]    The earliest observers of these spots had remarked that they seem to  have a common motion across the sun. In Fig. 14 we give a copy of a  remarkable drawing by Father Scheiner, showing the motion of two spots  observed by him in March, 1627. The figure indicates the successive  positions assumed by the spots on the several days from the 2nd to the  16th March. Those marks which are merely given in outline represent the  assumed positions on the 11th and the 13th, on which days it happened  that the weather was cloudy, so that no observations could be made. It  is invariably found that these objects move in the same  direction--namely, from the eastern to the western limb[3] of the sun.  They complete the journey across the face of the sun in twelve or  thirteen days, after which they remain invisible for about the same  length of time until they reappear at the eastern limb. These early  observers were quick to discern the true import of their discovery. They  deduced from these simple observations the remarkable fact that the sun,  like the earth, performs a rotation on its axis, and in the same  direction. But there is the important difference between these rotations  that whereas the earth takes only twenty-four hours to turn once round,  the solar globe takes about twenty-six days to complete one of its much  more deliberate rotations.    [Illustration: PLATE III.    SPOTS AND FACULAE ON THE SUN.    (FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY MR. WARREN DE LA RUE, 20TH SEPT., 1861.)]    If we examine sun-spots under favourable atmospheric conditions and  with a telescope of fairly large aperture, we perceive a great amount of  interesting detail which is full of information with regard to the  structure of the sun. The penumbra of a spot is often found to be made  up of filaments directed towards the middle of the spot, and generally  brighter at their inner ends, where they adjoin the nucleus. In a  regularly formed spot the outline of the penumbra is of the same general  form as that of the nucleus, but astronomers are frequently deeply  interested by witnessing vast spots of very irregular figure. In such  cases the bright surface-covering of the sun (the photosphere, as it is  called) often encroaches on the nucleus and forms a peninsula stretching  out into, or even bridging across, the gloomy interior. This is well  shown in Professor Langley's fine drawing (Plate II.) of a very  irregular spot which he observed on December 23-24, 1873.    The details of a spot vary continually; changes may often be noticed  even from day to day, sometimes from hour to hour. A similar remark may  be made with respect to the bright streaks or patches which are  frequently to be observed especially in the neighbourhood of spots.  These bright marks are known by the name of _faculae_ (little torches).  They are most distinctly seen near the margin of the sun, where the  light from its surface is not so bright as it is nearer to the centre of  the disc. The reduction of light at the margin is due to the greater  thickness of absorbing atmosphere round the sun, through which the light  emitted from the regions near the margin has to pass in starting on its  way towards us.    None of the markings on the solar disc constitute permanent features on  the sun. Some of these objects may no doubt last for weeks. It has,  indeed, occasionally happened that the same spot has marked the solar  globe for many months; but after an existence of greater or less  duration those on one part of the sun may disappear, while as frequently  fresh marks of the same kind become visible in other places. The  inference from these various facts is irresistible. They tell us that  the visible surface of the sun is not a solid mass, is not even a liquid  mass, but that the globe, so far as we can see it, consists of matter in  the gaseous, or vaporous, condition.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Scheiner's Observations on Sun-spots.]    It often happens that a large spot divides into two or more separate  portions, and these have been sometimes seen to fly apart with a  velocity in some cases not less than a thousand miles an hour. \"At  times, though very rarely\" (I quote here Professor Young,[4] to whom I  am frequently indebted), \"a different phenomenon of the most surprising  and startling character appears in connection with these objects:  patches of intense brightness suddenly break out, remaining visible for  a few minutes, moving, while they last, with velocities as great as one  hundred miles _a second_.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Zones on the Sun's Surface in which Spots  appear.]    \"One of these events has become classical. It occurred on the forenoon  (Greenwich time) of September 1st, 1859, and was independently witnessed  by two well-known and reliable observers--Mr. Carrington and Mr.  Hodgson--whose accounts of the matter may be found in the Monthly  Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society for November, 1859. Mr.  Carrington at the time was making his usual daily observations upon the  position, configuration, and size of the spots by means of an image of  the solar disc upon a screen--being then engaged upon that eight years'  series of observations which lie at the foundation of so much of our  present solar science. Mr. Hodgson, at a distance of many miles, was at  the same time sketching details of sun-spot structure by means of a  solar eye-piece and shade-glass. They simultaneously saw two luminous  objects, shaped something like two new moons, each about eight thousand  miles in length and two thousand wide, at a distance of some twelve  thousand miles from each other. These burst suddenly into sight at the  edge of a great sun-spot with a dazzling brightness at least five or six  times that of the neighbouring portions of the photosphere, and moved  eastward over the spot in parallel lines, growing smaller and fainter,  until in about five minutes they disappeared, after traversing a course  of nearly thirty-six thousand miles.\"    The sun-spots do not occur at all parts of the sun's surface  indifferently. They are mainly found in two zones (Fig. 15) on each side  of the solar equator between the latitudes of 10 deg. and 30 deg.. On the  equator the spots are rare except, curiously enough, near the time when  there are few spots elsewhere. In high latitudes they are never seen.  Closely connected with these peculiar principles of their distribution  is the remarkable fact that spots in different latitudes do not indicate  the same values for the period of rotation of the sun. By watching a  spot near the sun's equator Carrington found that it completed a  revolution in twenty-five days and two hours. At a latitude of 20 deg. the  period is about twenty-five days and eighteen hours, at 30 deg. it is no  less than twenty-six days and twelve hours, while the comparatively few  spots observed in the latitude of 45 deg. require twenty-seven and a half  days to complete their circuit.

Having now seen the tomb, if you desire to form a more vivid impression  of the principal actors in this tragedy than can be derived from a  narrative, pay a visit to the Barberini Gallery, where you will see,  with five other masterpieces by Guido, the portrait of Beatrice, taken,  some say the night before her execution, others during her progress to  the scaffold; it is the head of a lovely girl, wearing a headdress  composed of a turban with a lappet. The hair is of a rich fair chestnut  hue; the dark eyes are moistened with recent tears; a perfectly farmed  nose surmounts an infantile mouth; unfortunately, the loss of tone in  the picture since it was painted has destroyed the original fair  complexion. The age of the subject may be twenty, or perhaps twenty-two  years.    Near this portrait is that of Lucrezia Petrani the small head indicates  a person below the middle height; the attributes are those of a Roman  matron in her pride; her high complexion, graceful contour, straight  nose, black eyebrows, and expression at the same time imperious and  voluptuous indicate this character to the life; a smile still seems to  linger an the charming dimpled cheeks and perfect mouth mentioned by the  chronicler, and her face is exquisitely framed by luxuriant curls  falling from her forehead in graceful profusion.    As for Giacomo and Bernardo, as no portraits of them are in existence,  we are obliged to gather an idea of their appearance from the manuscript  which has enabled us to compile this sanguinary history; they are thus  described by the eye-witness of the closing scene--Giacomo was short,  well-made and strong, with black hair and beard; he appeared to be about  twenty-six years of age.    Poor Bernardo was the image of his sister, so nearly resembling her,  that when he mounted the scaffold his long hair and girlish face led  people to suppose him to be Beatrice herself: he might be fourteen or  fifteen years of age.    The peace of God be with them!                                            ----"]]]
