And that we may  furnish an acceptable family newspaper, we shall continue to give in a  brief and condensed form, the most useful and interesting intelligence  of passing events,--not omitting a small portion of serious matter,  suitable for Sunday reading, but avoiding the disgusting and  pernicious details of crime, with which too many of our public  journals abound, and which evidently produces a deleterious effect on  the morals of the community. With regard to political and sectarian  subjects, however, we feel much inclined to change our style of  neutrality so far as to advocate all parties, sects and denominations,  each in its turn, which course may be more in accordance with our own  maxim of \"enlightening and pleasing,\" than either growling policy, or  the affected indifference and cold inattention which tends to produce  a reciprocity of coldness, and pleases none. On the subject of policy  and rules, we might say more; but having already said twice as much as  we at first intended, and finding ourselves near the bottom of the  scrap on which we scribble, we have only to find some suitable form of  sentence wherewith to round off this subject; and for this purpose,  without wishing to be suspected of any motives of interest, we would  gently and respectfully suggest to our readers the propriety of  advancing the intelligence, enterprise and consequent prosperity of  the community, by introducing and recommending to the patronage of  all, this same SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.           *       *       *       *       *          ADVANTAGE OF LOW FARES.      During the month of July, 1845, when the fare between New York and  Boston was reduced to the \"ruinous rates\" of only two dollars, the  receipts on the different routes were $45,208; but during the  corresponding month of the present year, with the fare up to four  dollars, the receipts have been only $35,963: being _nine thousand two  hundred and forty-five dollars_ less for a single month, than when the  fares were at half-price.           *       *       *       *       *          AVALON RAILROAD IRON.

Much confidence is expressed by  some of the Vermont papers that the enterprise will be carried  through.    It is stated that the Magnetic Telegraph will extended from Washington  city to Richmond, and completed before the middle of December next.    TELEGRAPH TO CANADA.--It affords us great satisfaction, says the  Montreal Herald, to learn that there is a great probability of the  \"lightning lines\"--the Electric Telegraph--being extended from the  great cities of the United States to Montreal and Quebec. A gentleman  is now in town, and has submitted proposals to the Board of Trade for  making an immediate commencement with this most, important public  work. This line is expected to be extended to Montreal from Saratoga,  to which place a line is already in operation.    The line between New York and Buffalo having been recently completed,  the following is reported to have been the first telegraphic  conversation on the occasion.

Mr. Editor,--I have a saw-mill which draws thirty-six square inches of  water, under thirty feet head. I wish to build another below with only  twenty feet head of water. How many square inches aperture will be  required to discharge the same quantity in the same time? If some of  your correspondents will give me an answer, they will much oblige me.  R. C. Navarino, Sept. 7, 1846.    We shall have no occasion to depend on correspondents for the  intelligence above required. Thirty-six inches of aperture under  thirty feet head, will admit the discharge of 660 cubic feet of water  per minute; the velocity of the water being forty-four feet per  second. Under twenty feet head the velocity is only thirty-six feet  per second, and consequently forty-four inches aperture is required to  discharge an equal quantity.    _Rule in Hydraulics_: (never before published.) To ascertain the  velocity of water issuing through an aperture under a given head:  Multiply the head in feet by 62, and the square root of the product  will show the velocity in feet per second.           *       *       *       *       *          RAILROAD INTELLIGENCE.      Old Colony Railroad, from Boston to Plymouth, Mass., has for some time  past been in full operation, and is doing a fair business.    The whole amount of the stock of the Michigan Central  Railroad--$2,000,000--has been taken up, and of course the enterprise  will go forward.    On the first day of the opening of the subscription books for the  stock of the New York and Boston Railroad, the people of Middletown  took shares to the amount of $350,000; and they expect to go up to  half a million.    The Cheshire N. H. Railroad is going ahead rapidly, the grading and  bridging on every part of the line being in progress. This road is to  be carried over the Connecticut River at or near Bellows' Falls.    The stock of the Wilton N. H. Branch Railroad is said to be all taken  up.    A General Meeting of the proprietors of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic  Railway was recently held at Montreal. It appears by the report of the  board of directors, that 5,364 shares had been taken up, amounting to  about L1,200,000. All parties appear to be confident that this road  will be constructed and in operation at an early day.    The Little Miami Railroad having been opened to Springfield, is doing  a fair business, and adds important facilities to trade in that  section.    The directors of the New York and Erie Railroad are said to be \"going  on with it in the right way to accomplish the great object of the  undertaking.\" Contracts are already made for the construction of the  road as far as the valley of the Delaware. Proposals for grading 133  miles more are advertised for, which will carry the road to  Binghampton, 270 miles from New York.           *       *       *       *       *      It is asserted that of all single marriageable ladies who reached  Oregon last season, two-thirds were married before the first of March.           *       *       *       *       *      Alexandria has decided on re-annexation to Virginia, by a vote of 633  to 197.

In other cells I leave the Bee's larva and  insert Sitares, placing them sometimes on the honey and sometimes on  the inner wall of the cell or simply at the entrance. Lastly, all the  cells thus prepared are put in glass tubes, which enable me to observe  them readily, without fear of disturbing my famished guests at their  meal.    [Footnote 1: Fabre, as a young man, was a master at Avignon College.  Cf. _The Life of the Fly_: chaps. xii., xiii., xix. and  xx.--_Translator's Note_.]    But what am I saying? Their meal? There is no meal! The Sitares,  placed at the entrance to a cell, far from seeking to make their way  in, leave it and go roaming about the glass tube; those which have  been placed on the inner surface of the cells, near the honey, emerge  precipitately, half-caught in the glue and tripping at every step;  lastly, those which I thought I had favoured the most, by placing them  on the honey itself, struggle, become entangled in the sticky mass and  perish in it, suffocated. Never did experiment break down so  completely! Larvae, nymphs, cells, honey: I have offered you them all!  Then what do you want, you fiendish little creatures?    Tired of all these fruitless attempts, I ended where I ought to have  begun: I went to Carpentras. But it was too late: the Anthophora had  finished her work; and I did not succeed in seeing anything new.  During the course of the year I learnt from Leon Dufour,[2] to whom I  had spoken of the Sitares, that the tiny creature which he had found  on the Andrenae[3] and described under the generic name of  Triungulinus, was recognized later by Newport[4] as the larva of a  Meloe, or Oil-beetle. Now it so happened that I had found a few  Oil-beetles in the cells of the same Anthophora that nourishes the  Sitares. Could there be a similarity of habits between the two kinds  of insects? This idea threw a sudden light for me upon the subject;  but I had plenty of time in which to mature my plans: I had another  year to wait.    [Footnote 2: Jean Marie Leon Dufour (1780-1865), an army surgeon who  served with distinction in several campaigns, and subsequently  practised as a doctor in the Landes, where he attained great eminence  as a naturalist. Fabre often refers to him as the Wizard of the  Landes. Cf. _The Life of the Spider_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by  Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chap. i.; and _The Life of the Fly_:  chap. i.--_Translator's Note_.]    [Footnote 3: A genus of Burrowing Bee, the most numerous in species  among the British Bees.--_Translator's Note_.]    [Footnote 4: George Newport (1803-1854), an English surgeon and  naturalist, president of the Entomological Society from 1844 to 1845  and an expert in insect anatomy.--_Translator's Note_.]    When April came, my Sitaris-larvae began, as usual, to bestir  themselves. The first Bee to appear, an Osmia, is dropped alive into a  glass jar containing a few of these larvae; and after a lapse of some  fifteen minutes I inspect them through the pocket-lens. Five Sitares  are embedded in the fleece of the thorax. It is done, the problem's  solved! The larvae of the Sitares, like those of the Oil-beetles,  cling like grim death to the fleece of their generous host and make  him carry them into the cell. Ten times over I repeat the experiment  with the various Bees that come to plunder the lilac flowering outside  my window and in particular with male Anthophorae; the result is still  the same: the larvae embed themselves in the hair of the Bees' thorax.  But after so many disappointments one becomes distrustful and it is  better to go and observe the facts upon the spot; besides, the Easter  holidays fall very conveniently and afford me the leisure for my  observations.    I will admit that my heart was beating a little faster than usual when  I found myself once again standing in front of the perpendicular bank  in which the Anthophora nests. What will be the result of the  experiment? Will it once more cover me with confusion? The weather is  cold and rainy; not a Bee shows herself on the few spring flowers that  have come out. Numbers of Anthophorae cower, numbed and motionless, at  the entrance to the galleries. With the tweezers, I extract them one  by one from their lurking-places, to examine them under the lens. The  first has Sitaris-larvae on her thorax; so has the second; the third  and fourth likewise; and so on, as far as I care to pursue the  examination. I change galleries ten times, twenty times; the result is  invariable. Then, for me, occurred one of the moments which come to  those who, after considering and reconsidering an idea for years and  years from every point of view, are at last able to cry: \"Eureka!\"    On the days that followed, a serene and balmy sky enabled the  Anthophorae to leave their retreats and scatter over the countryside  and despoil the flowers. I renewed my examination on those Anthophorae  flying incessantly from one flower to another, whether in the  neighbourhood of the places where they were born or at great distances  from these places. Some were without Sitaris-larvae; others, more  numerous, had two, three, four, five or more among the hairs of their  thorax. At Avignon, where I have not yet seen _Sitaris humeralis_, the  same species of Anthophora, observed at almost the same season, while  pillaging the lilac-blossom, was always free of young Sitaris-grubs;  at Carpentras, on the contrary, where there is not a single  Anthophora-colony without Sitares, nearly three-quarters of the  specimens which I examined carried a few of these larvae in their  fleece.    But, on the other hand, if we look for these larvae in the  entrance-lobbies where we found them, a few days ago, piled up in  heaps, we no longer see them. Consequently, when the Anthophorae,  having opened their cells, enter the galleries to reach the exit and  fly away, or else when the bad weather and the darkness bring them  back there for a time, the young Sitaris-larvae, kept on the alert in  these same galleries by the stimulus of instinct, attach themselves to  the Bees, wriggling into their fur and clutching it so firmly that  they need not fear a fall during the long journeys of the insect which  carries them. By thus attaching themselves to the Anthophorae the  young Sitares evidently intend to get themselves carried, at the  opportune moment, into the victualled cells.    One might even at first sight believe that they live for some time on  the Anthophora's body, just as the ordinary parasites, the various  species of Lice, live on the body of the animal that feeds them. But  not at all. The young Sitares, embedded in the fleece, at right angles  to the Anthophora's body, head inwards, rump outwards, do not stir  from the point which they have selected, a point near the Bee's  shoulders. We do not see them wandering from spot to spot, exploring  the Anthophora's body, seeking the part where the skin is more  delicate, as they would certainly do if they were really deriving some  nourishment from the juices of the Bee. On the contrary, they are  nearly always established on the toughest and hardest part of the  Bee's body, on the thorax, a little below the insertion of the wings,  or, more rarely, on the head; and they remain absolutely motionless,  fixed to the same hair, by means of the mandibles, the feet, the  closed crescent of the eighth segment and, lastly, the glue of the  anal button. If they chance to be disturbed in this position, they  reluctantly repair to another point of the thorax, pushing their way  through the insect's fur and in the end fastening on to another hair,  as before.    To confirm my conviction that the young Sitaris-grubs do not feed on  the Anthophora's body, I have sometimes placed within their reach, in  a glass jar, some Bees that have long been dead and are completely  dried up. On these dry corpses, fit at most for gnawing, but certainly  containing nothing to suck, the Sitaris-larvae took up their customary  position and there remained motionless as on the living insect. They  obtain nothing, therefore, from the Anthophora's body; but perhaps  they nibble her fleece, even as the Bird-lice nibble the birds'  feathers?    To do this, they would require mouth-parts endowed with a certain  strength and, in particular, horny and sturdy jaws, whereas their jaws  are so fine that a microscopic examination failed to show them to me.  The larvae, it is true, are provided with powerful mandibles; but  these finely-pointed mandibles, with their backward curve, though  excellent for tugging at food and tearing it to pieces, are useless  for grinding it or gnawing it. Lastly, we have a final proof of the  passive condition of the Sitaris-larvae on the body of the Anthophorae  in the fact that the Bees do not appear to be in any way incommoded by  their presence, since we do not see them trying to rid themselves of  the grubs. Some Anthophorae which were free from these grubs and some  others which were carrying five or six upon their bodies were placed  separately in glass jars. When the first disturbance resulting from  their captivity was appeased, I could see nothing peculiar about those  occupied by the young Sitares. And, if all these arguments were not  sufficient, I might add that a creature which has already been able to  spend seven months without food and which in a few days' time will  proceed to drink a highly-flavoured fluid would be guilty of a  singular inconsistency if it were to start nibbling the dry fleece of  a Bee. It therefore seems to me undeniable that the young Sitares  settle on the Anthophora's body merely to make her carry them into the  cells which she will soon be building.    But until then the future parasites must hold tight to the fleece of  their hostess, despite her rapid evolutions among the flowers, despite  her rubbing against the walls of the galleries"]]]
