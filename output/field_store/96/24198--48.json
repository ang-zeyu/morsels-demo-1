Only one or two light blue-purple flowers grow  in the axils of the leaves of our common vetch. The leaf,  compounded of from eight to fourteen leaflets, indented at the  top, has a long terminal tendril, whose little sharp tip assists  the awkward vine, like a grappling hook.    The AMERICAN VETCH or TARE or PEA VINE (V. Americana) boasts  slightly larger bluish-purple flowers than the blue vetch, but  fewer of them; from three to nine only forming its loose raceme.  In moist soil throughout a very broad northerly and westerly  range it climbs and trails its graceful way, with the help of the  tendrils on the tips of leaves compounded of from eight to  fourteen oblong, blunt, and veiny leaflets.      BEACH, SEA, SEASIDE, or EVERLASTING PEA    (Lathyrus maritimus)  Pea family    Flowers - Purple, butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard petal,  wings, and keel; 1 in. long or less, clustered in short raceme at  end of slender footstalk from leaf axils; calyx 5-toothed;  stamens 10 (9 and 1); style curved, flattened, bearded on inner  side. Stem: to 2 ft. long, stout, reclining, spreading, leafy.  Leaves: Compounded of 3 to 6 pairs of oblong leaflets somewhat  larger than halberd-shaped stipules at base of leaf; branched  tendrils at end of it. Fruit: A flat, 2-valved, veiny pod,  continuous between the seeds.  Preferred Habitat - Beaches of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, also  of Great Lakes.  Flowering Season - May-August. Sometimes blooming again in  autumn.  Distribution - New Jersey to Arctic Circle; also Northern Europe  and Asia.    Sturdy clumps of the beach pea, growing beyond reach of the tide  in the dunes and sandy wastelands back of the beach, afford the  bee the last restaurant where he may regale himself without fear  of drowning. From some members of the pea family, as from the  wild lupine, for example, his weight, as he moves about, actually  pumps the pollen that has fallen into the forward part of the  blossom's keel onto his body, that he may transfer it to another  flower. In some other members his weight so depresses the keel  that the stamens are forced out to dust him over, the flower  resuming its original position to protect its nectar and the  remaining pollen just as soon as the pressure is removed. Other  peas, again, burst at his pressure, and discharge their pollen on  him. Now, in the beach pea, and similarly in the vetches, the  style is hairy on its inner side, to brush out the pollen on the  visitor who sets the automatic sweeper in motion as he alights  and moves about. So perfectly have many members of this  interesting family adapted their structure to the requirements of  insects, and so implicitly do they rely on their automatic  mechanism, that they have actually lost the power to fertilize  themselves.    In moist or wet ground throughout a northern range from ocean to  ocean, the MARSH VETCHLING (Lathyrus palustris) bears its purple,  butterfly-shaped flowers, that are the merest trifle over half  the size of those of the beach pea. From two to six of these  little blossoms are alternately set along the end of the stalk.  The leaflets, which are narrowly oblong, and acute at the apex,  stand up opposite each other in pairs (from two to four) along  the main leafstalk, that splits at the end to form hooked  tendrils.      BUTTERFLY or BLUE PEA    (Clitoria Mariana)  Pea family    Flowers - Bright lavender blue, showy, about 2 in. long; from 1  to 3 borne on a short peduncle. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed; corolla  butterfly-shaped, consisting of very large, erect standard petal,  notched at rounded apex; 2 oblong, curved wings, and shorter,  acute keel; 10 stamens; style incurved, and hairy along inner  side. Stem: Smooth, ascending or partly twining, 1 to 3 ft. high.  Leaves: Compounded of 3 oblong leaflets, paler beneath, each on  short stalk. Fruit: A few-seeded, acutely pointed pod about 1 in.  long.  Preferred Habitat - Dry soil.  Flowering Season - June-July.  Distribution - New Jersey to Florida, westward to Missouri,  Texas, and Mexico.    A beautiful blossom, flaunting a large banner out of all  proportion to the size of its other parts, that it may arrest the  attention of its benefactors the bees. According to Henderson,  the plant, which is found in our Southern States and over the  Mexican border, grows also in the Khasia Mountains of India, but  in no intervening place. Several members of the tropic-loving  genus, that produce large, highly colored flowers, have been  introduced to American hothouses; but the blue butterfly pea is  our only native representative. The genus is thought to take its  name from kleio, to shut up, in reference to the habit these peas  have of seeding long before the flower drops off.      WILD or HOG PEANUT    (Falcata comosa; Amphicarpaea monoica of Gray)  Pea family    Flowers - Numerous small, showy ones, borne in drooping clusters  from axils of upper leaves; lilac, pale purplish, or rarely  white, butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard petal partly  enfolding wings and keel. Calyx tubular, 4 or 5 toothed; 10  stamens (9 and 1); 1 pistil. (Also solitary fertile flowers,  lacking petals, on thread-like, creeping branches from lower  axils or underground). Stem: Twining wiry brownish-hairy, to 8  ft. long. Leaves: Compounded of 3 thin leaflets, egg-shaped at  base, acutely pointed at tip. Fruit: Hairy pod 1 in. long. Also  1-seeded, pale, rounded, underground peanut.  Preferred Habitat - Moist thickets, shady roadsides.  Flowering Season - August-September.  Distribution - New Brunswick westward to Nebraska, south to Gulf  of Mexico.    Amphicarpaea (\"seed at both ends\"), the Greek name by which this  graceful vine was formerly known, emphasizes its most interesting  feature, that, nevertheless, seems to many a foolish duplication  of energy on Nature's part. Why should the same plant bear two  kinds of blossoms and seeds? Among the foliage of low shrubbery  and plants in shady lanes and woodside thickets, we see the  delicate, drooping clusters of lilac blossoms hanging where bees  can readily discover them and, in pilfering their sweets,  transfer their pollen from flower to flower. But in case of  failure to intercross these blossoms that are dependent upon  insect help to set fertile seed, what then? Must the plant run  the risk of extinction? Self-fertilization may be an evil, but  failure to produce seed at all is surely the greatest one. To  guard against such a calamity, insignificant looking flowers that  have no petals to open for the enticing of insects, but which  fertilize themselves with their own pollen, produce abundant seed  close to the ground or under it.Then what need of the showy  blossoms hanging in the thicket above? Close inbreeding in the  vegetable world, as in the animal, ultimately produces degenerate  offspring; and although the showy lilac blossoms of the wild  peanut yield comparatively few cross-fertilized seeds, these are  quite sufficient to enable the vine to maintain those desired  features which are the inheritance from ancestors that struggled  in their day and generation after perfection. No plant dares  depend upon its cleistogamous or blind flowers alone for  offspring; and in the sixty or more genera containing these  curious growths, that usually look like buds arrested in  development, every plant that bears them bears also showy flowers  dependent upon cross-pollination by insect aid.    The boy who        \"Drives home the cows from the pasture       Up through the long shady lane\"    knows how reluctantly they leave the feast afforded by the wild  peanut. Hogs, rooting about in the moist soil where it grows,  unearth the hairy pods that should produce next year's vines;  hence the poor excuse for branding a charming plant with a  repellent folk-name,      VIOLETS    (Viola)  Violet family    Lacking perfume only to be a perfectly satisfying flower, the  COMMON, PURPLE, MEADOW, or HOODED BLUE VIOLET (V. obliqua; V.  cucullata of Gray) has nevertheless established itself in the  hearts of the people from the Arctic to the Gulf as no  sweet-scented, showy, hothouse exotic has ever done. Royal in  color as in lavish profusion, it blossoms everywhere - in woods,  waysides, meadows, and marshes, but always in finer form in cool,  shady dells; with longer flowering scapes in meadow bogs; and  with longer leaves than wide in swampy woodlands. The  heart-shaped, saw-edged leaves, folded toward the center when  newly put forth, and the five-petalled, bluish-purple,  golden-hearted blossom are too familiar for more detailed  description. From the three-cornered stars of the elastic  capsules, the seeds are scattered abroad.    Beards on the spurred lower petal and the two side petals give  the bees a foothold when they turn head downward, as some must,  to suck nectar. This attitude enables them to receive the pollen  dusted on their abdomens, when they jar the flower, at a point  nearest their pollen-collecting hairs. It is also an economical  advantage to the flower which can sift the pollen downward on the  bee instead of exposing it to the pollen-eating interlopers.  Among the latter may be classed the bumblebees and butterflies  whose long lips and tongues pilfer ad libitum. \"For the proper  visitors of the bearded violets,\" says Professor Robertson, \"we  must look to the small bees, among which the Osmias are the most  important.\"    When science was younger and hair splitting an uncommon  indulgence of botanists, the EARLY BLUE VIOLET (Viola palmata)  was thought to be simply a variety of the common purple violet,  whose heart-shaped leaves frequently show a tendency to divide  into lobes. But the early blue violet, however roundish or  heart-shaped its early leaves may be, has the later ones  variously divided into from three to thirteen lobes, often almost  as much cut on the sides as the leaves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30047"],[0,"Aircraft and Submarines (#8)"],[1,"balloon  it becomes flabby, and can be driven through the air only with  extreme difficulty. In the balloon of the Robert brothers air could  from time to time be pumped into the space between the two skins,  keeping the outer envelope always fully distended and rigid. In  later years this idea has been modified by incorporating in the  envelope one large or a number of smaller balloons or \"balloonets,\"  into which air may be pumped as needed.    The shape too has come to approximate that of a fish rather than a  bird, in the case of balloons at least. \"The head of a cod and the  tail of a mackerel,\" was the way Marey-Monge, the French aeronaut  described it. Though most apparent in dirigible balloons, this will  be seen to be the favourite design for airplanes if the wings be  stripped off, and the body and tail alone considered. Complete,  these machines are not unlike a flying fish.    In England, Sir George Cayley, as early as 1810 studied and wrote  largely on the subject of dirigibles but, though the English call  him the \"father of British aeronautics,\" his work seems to have been  rather theoretical than practical. He did indeed demonstrate  mathematically that no lifting power existed that would support the  cumbrous steam-engine of that date, and tried to solve this dilemma  by devising a gas engine, and an explosive engine. With one of the  latter, driven by a series of explosions of gunpowder, each in a  separate cell set off by a detonator, he equipped a flying machine  which attained a sufficient height to frighten Cayley's coachman,  whom he had persuaded to act as pilot. The rather unwilling aviator,  fearing a loftier flight, jumped out and broke his leg. Though by  virtue of this martyrdom his name should surely have descended to  fame with that of Cayley it has been lost, together with all record  of any later performances of the machine, which unquestionably  embodied some of the basic principles of our modern aircraft, though  it antedated the first of these by nearly a century.    [Illustration: Giffard's Dirigible.]    We may pass over hastily some of the later experiments with dirigibles  that failed. In 1834 the Count de Lennox built an airship 130 feet  long to be driven by oars worked by man power. When the crowd that  gathered to watch the ascent found that the machine was too heavy to  ascend even without the men, they expressed their lively contempt for  the inventor by tearing his clothes to tatters and smashing his  luckless airship. In 1852, another Frenchman, Henry Giffard, built a  cigar-shaped balloon 150 feet long by 40 feet in diameter, driven by  steam. The engine weighed three hundred pounds and generated about 3  H.-P.--about 1/200 as much power as a gas engine of equal weight would  produce. Even with this slender power, however, Giffard attained a  speed, independent of the wind, of from five to seven miles an  hour--enough at least for steerage way. This was really the first  practical demonstration of the possibilities of the mechanical  propulsion of balloons. Several adaptations of the Giffard idea  followed, and in 1883 Renard and Krebs, in a fusiform ship, driven by  an electric motor, attained a speed of fifteen miles an hour. By this  time inventive genius in all countries--save the United States which  lagged in interest in dirigibles--was stimulated. Germany and France  became the great protagonists in the struggle for precedence and in  the struggle two figures stand out with commanding prominence--the  Count von Zeppelin and Santos-Dumont, a young Brazilian resident in  Paris who without official countenance consecrated his fortune to, and  risked his life in, the service of aviation.          CHAPTER III    THE SERVICES OF SANTOS-DUMONT      In his book _My Airships_ the distinguished aviator A. Santos-Dumont  tells this story of the ambition of his youth and its realization in  later days:         I cannot say at what age I made my first kites, but I remember       how my comrades used to tease me at our game of \"pigeon flies.\"       All the children gather round a table and the leader calls out       \"Pigeon Flies! Hen flies! Crow flies! Bee flies!\" and so on; and       at each call we were supposed to raise our fingers. Sometimes,       however, he would call out \"Dog flies! Fox flies!\" or some other       like impossibility to catch us. If any one raised a finger then       he was made to pay a forfeit. Now my playmates never failed to       wink and smile mockingly at me when one of them called \"Man       flies!\" for at the word I would always raise my finger very high,       as a sign of absolute conviction, and I refused with energy to       pay the forfeit. The more they laughed at me the happier I was,       hoping that some day the laugh would be on my side.         Among the thousands of letters which I received after winning the       Deutsch prize (a prize offered in 1901 for sailing around the       Eiffel Tower) there was one that gave me peculiar pleasure. I       quote from it as a matter of curiosity:         \"Do you remember, my dear Alberto, when we played together       'Pigeon Flies!'? It came back to me suddenly when the news of       your success reached Rio. 'Man flies!' old fellow! You were right       to raise your finger, and you have just proved it by flying round       the Eiffel Tower.          \"They play the old game now more than ever at home; but the       name has been changed, and the rules modified since October 19,       1901. They call it now 'Man flies!' and he who does not raise his       finger at the word pays the forfeit.\"    The story of Santos-Dumont affords a curious instance of a boy being  obsessed by an idea which as a man he carried to its successful  fruition. It offers also evidence of the service that may accrue to  society from the devotion of a dilettante to what people may call a  \"fad,\" but what is in fact the germ of a great idea needing only an  enthusiast with enthusiasm, brains, and money for its development.  Because the efforts of Santos-Dumont always smacked of the amateur  he has been denied his real place in the history of aeronautics,  which is that of a fearless innovator, and a devoted worker in the  cause.    Born on one of those great coffee plantations of Brazil, where all  is done by machinery that possibly can be, Santos-Dumont early  developed a passion for mechanics. In childhood he made toy  airplanes. He confesses that his favourite author was Jules Verne,  that literary idol of boyhood, who while writing books as wildly  imaginative as any dime tale of redskins, or nickel novel of the  doings of \"Nick Carter\" had none the less the spirit of prophecy  that led him to forecast the submarine, the automobile, and the  navigation of the air. At fifteen Santos-Dumont saw his first  balloon and marked the day with red.    [Illustration: (C) U. & U.    _A British Kite Balloon._    (_The open sack at the lower end catches the breeze and keeps the  balloon steady._)]         I too desired to go ballooning [he writes]. In the long       sun-bathed Brazilian afternoons, when the hum of insects,       punctuated by the far-off cry of some bird lulled me, I would lie       in the shade of the veranda and gaze into the fair sky of Brazil       where the birds fly so high and soar with such ease on their       great outstretched wings; where the clouds mount so gaily in the       pure light of day, and you have only to raise your eyes to fall       in love with space and freedom. So, musing on the exploration of       the aerial ocean, I, too, devised airships and flying-machines in       my imagination.    [Illustration: (C) U. & U.    _A British \"Blimp\" Photographed from Above._]    From dreaming, the boy's ambitions rapidly developed into actions.  Good South Americans, whatever the practice of their northern  neighbours, do not wait to die before going to Paris. At the age of  eighteen the youth found himself in the capital of the world. To his  amazement he found that the science of aeronautics, such as it was,  had stopped with Giffard's work in 1852. No dirigible was to be  heard of in all Paris. The antiquated gas ball was the only way to  approach the upper air. When the boy tried to arrange for an  ascension the balloonist he consulted put so unconscionable a price  on one ascent that he bought an automobile instead--one of the first  made, for this was in 1891--and with it returned to Brazil. It was  not until six years later that, his ambition newly fired by reading  of Andree's plans for reaching the Pole in a balloon, Santos-Dumont  took up anew his ambition to become an aviator. His own account of  his first ascent does not bear precisely the hall-mark of the  enthusiast too rapt in ecstasy to think of common things. \"I had  brought up,\" he notes gravely, \"a substantial lunch of hard-boiled  eggs, cold roast beef and chicken, cheese, ice cream, fruits and  cakes, champagne, coffee, and chartreuse!\"    The balloon with its intrepid voyagers nevertheless returned to  earth in safety.    A picturesque figure, an habitue of the clubs and an eager  sportsman, Santos-Dumont at once won the liking of the French  people, and attracted attention wherever people gave thought to  aviation. Liberal in expenditure of money, and utterly fearless in  exposing his life, he pushed his experiments for the development of  a true dirigible tirelessly. Perhaps his major fault was that he  learned but slowly from the experiences of others. He clung to the  spherical balloon long after the impossibility of controlling it in  the air was accepted as unavoidable by aeronauts. But in 1898 having  become infatuated with the performances of a little sixty-six pound  tricycle motor he determined to build a cigar-shaped airship to fit  it, and with that determination won success.    Amateur he may have been, was indeed throughout the greater part of  his career as an airman. Nevertheless Santos-Du"]]]
