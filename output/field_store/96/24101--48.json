Examples of this sort are to be found all over Britain, but a great  deal less frequently in France, where the communication is by a more  direct line between important centres, often leaving the small and  unimportant towns out of the itinerary altogether.    In England, centralization or nationalization of the road-building  authority should remedy all this. Cuts and deviations from existing  lines, for the general good, would then be made without local  jealousy or misapplied influence being brought to bear, and the  general details of width and surface be carried on throughout the  land, under one supreme power, and not, as often now is the case, by  various local district and urban councils and county surveyors.    \"The Great North Road\" and \"The Famous Bath Road\" vary greatly  throughout their length as to width and excellence; and yet popular  opinion in the south of England would seem to indicate that these  roads, to single them out from among others, are idyllic, both in  character of surface and skill of engineering, throughout their  length. This is manifestly not so. The \"Bath Road,\" for example, in  parts, is as flat and well-formed a surface as one could hope to  find, even in France itself, but at times it degenerates into a mere  narrow, guttery alley, especially in its passage through some of the  Thames-side towns, where the surface is never of that excellence that  it should be; throughout its entire length of some hundred odd miles  to Bath there are ever-recurring evidence of bad road-making and  worse engineering.    One is bound to take into consideration that it is the automobile,  and the general increase in automobile traffic, that, in all  countries, is causing the wide-spread demand for improved roads.    To illustrate the growth of the use of the automobile on the public  highway, and taking France as an example, the following statistics  are given from the _Journal des Debats:_    In 1900 there were taxed in France 1,399 _voitures-automobiles_ of  more than two places, and 955 of one or two places. In 1903 the  figures had risen to 7,228 and 2,694 respectively. These figures may  seem astonishingly small at first glance, but their percentage of  growth is certainly abnormally large. These _voitures-automobiles_,  be it recalled, are all pleasure carriages, and displaced in the same  time (according to the same authority) 10,000 horse-drawn vehicles.  At the same period Paris alone claimed 1,845 _voitures-automobiles_  and 6,539 horse-drawn pleasure carriages.    Road reformers, wherever found, should agitate for two things: the  efficient maintenance of existing roads and the laying out of new and  improved thoroughfares where needed.    In England and America the roadways are under the care of so many  controlling bodies that they have suffered greatly. In England, for  example, there is one eighteen-mile strip of road which is under the  control of twelve different highway authorities, while the \"Great  North Road\" from London to Edinburgh, is, in England alone, subject  to seventy-two separate authorities. Local jealousies, rivalry and  factions, and the quarrels of various road authorities interfere  everywhere with good roads. The greatest good of the greatest number  is sacrificed to village squabbles and to the advice of the local  squire, who \"detests motor-cars,\" as he does most other signs of  progress. The roads of the future must be under some general control.  At present, affairs in England are pretty bad; let America take heed  in her new provisions for road supervision and government.    There is at present an almost Chinese jumble in the distribution of  authority over roads in England and Wales. There are in London alone  twenty-nine highway authorities, and 1,855 throughout the rest of the  country.    In view of the fact that through motor traffic of all kinds will  increase every year, it has been suggested that new loop roads should  be constructed round towns on the chief roads, private enterprise  being enlisted by the expectation of improved land value. This  certainly would be a move in the right direction.    [Illustration: Milestone pictures]    Mile-stone reform is another thing which is occupying the serious  attention of the road user. In Continental Europe this matter is  pretty well arranged, though there is frequently a discrepancy of  two, three, or even five kilometres between the national mile-stones  _(bornes kilometriques)_ and the sign-boards of the various local  authorities and touring clubs.    France has the best system extant of sign-boards and mile-stones. One  finds the great national, departmental, and communal signs and stones  everywhere, and at every hundred metres along the road are the  intermediate little white-numbered stones, from which you may take  your bearings almost momentarily, with never a fear that you are off  your track.    In addition to this the sign-boards of the Touring Club de France,  the Automobile Club de France, and the Association Generale  Automobile satisfy any further demands that may be made by the  traveller by automobile who wants to read as he runs. No such legible  signs and warnings are known elsewhere.    There is uniformity in all the kilometre and department boundary  stones in France; but in England \"mile-stones\" of all shapes, sizes,  materials, and degrees of legibility are found.    There are some curious relics in the form of ancient mile-stones  still in use, which may please the antiquarian, but are of no value  to the automobilist. There is the \"eightieth mile-stone on the  Holyhead Road\" in England, which carries one back through two  centuries of road travel; and there is a heavy old veteran of perhaps  a thousand years, which at one time marked the \"_Voie Aurelian,_\" as  it crossed Southern Gaul. It is found in Provence, in the  Bouches-du-Rhone, near Salon, and is a sight not to be missed by  those curiously inclined.    The question of dust is one of the chief problems yet to be solved  for the benefit of automobilists and the general public alike. A good  deal of the \"dust nuisance\" is due to badly made and badly kept  roads, but we must frankly admit that the automobile itself is often  the cause. \"La Ligue Contre la Poussiere,\" in France, has made some  interesting experiments, with the below enumerated results, as  related to automobile traffic. Road-builders and manufacturers of  automobiles alike have something here to make a note of.    (1) Sharp corners and excessive road cambers lead to slip, and,  therefore, to dust.    (2) More dust is raised on a rough road than on an equally dusty  smooth road.    (3) Watering the road moderately diminishes the dust.    (4) The spreading on the road of crude oil, or of oil emulsions in  water, is an important palliative.    (5) Wood, asphalt, cobblestones, and square pavings are not dusty  save after use by horse traffic.    (6) Cars with smooth, boat-shaped under surfaces are less dusty than  others.    (7) Cars with large mud-guards and leather flaps near the road are  more dusty.    (8) Cars on high wheels well away from the ground are less dusty.    (9) Cars with large tool-boxes at the back reaching low down between  the back wheels are dusty.    (10) Large car bodies are often dustier than small ones.    (11) Blowing the exhaust near the ground increases the dust.    (12) Cars fitted with engines having an insufficient fly-wheel or a  non-uniform turning effort from any cause are more dusty.    (13) A car mounted on very easy springs having a large up-and-down  play will suck up the dust with each rise and fall of the body on  rough roads.    (14) Front wheels--or rolling wheels--raise less dust than back  wheels or driving wheels.    (15) Smooth pneumatic tires are dusty.    (16) Solid or pneumatic rubber tires are more dusty at higher speeds,  and with high-powered engines.    (17) Non-skid devices, such as small steel studs, etc., do not  increase the dust.    A writer on automobilism and roads cannot leave the latter subject  without a reference to some of the obstructions and inconveniences to  which the automobilist has to submit. If the automobilist proved  himself a \"road obstruction\" like any of the following he would soon  be banished and the industry would suffer.    A correspondent in the _Auto_, the chief Parisian daily devoted to  automobilism, gave the following list of obstructions encountered in  a journey of a thousand kilometres:    1. Drivers having left their horses entirely unattended - 75    2. Drivers who would not make way to allow one to pass - 86    3. Driver is asleep - 8    4. Drivers not holding the reins - 12    5. Drivers in carriages, or carts, without lights at night - 81    6. Drivers stopping their horses in the middle of the road or at  dangerous turnings - 2    7. Drivers allowing their horses to descend hills unattended while  they walked behind - 18    8. Dogs throwing themselves in front of one - 35    9. Flocks of sheep met without guardians near by - 8    10. Cattle straying unattended - 10    11. Geese, hens and children in the middle of the road - 30    Instead of seven sins, any of which might be deadly, there are  eleven. Legislation must sooner or later protect the automobilist  better than it does to-day.      Chapter IV  Hotels & Things    [Illustration: Hotels & Things]    In all the literature of travel, that which is devoted to hotels has  been conspicuously neglected. Certainly a most interesting work could  be compiled.    Among the primitive peoples travellers were dependent upon the  hospitality of those among whom they came. After this arose a species  of hostelry, which catered for man and beast in a more or less crude  and uncomfortable manner; but which, nevertheless, was a great deal  better than depending upon the generosity and hospitality of  strangers, and vastly more comfortable than sleeping and eating in  the open.

Five eggs were laid, and incubation was  far advanced, when the storms and winds came. The cradle indeed did  rock. The boughs did not break, but they swayed and separated as you  would part your two interlocked hands. The ground of the little valley  fairly gave way, the nest tilted over till its contents fell into the  chasm. It was like an earthquake that destroys a hamlet.    No born tree-builder would have placed its nest in such a situation.  Birds that build at the end of the branch, like the oriole, tie the nest  fast; others, like the robin, build against the main trunk; still others  build securely in the fork. The sparrow, in her ignorance, rested her  house upon the spray of two branches, and when the tempest came, the  branches parted company and the nest was engulfed.    A little bob-tailed song sparrow built her nest in a pile of dry brush  very near the kitchen door of a farmhouse on the skirts of the northern  Catskills, where I was passing the summer. It was late in July, and she  had doubtless reared one brood in the earlier season. Her toilet was  decidedly the worse for wear. I noted her day after day, very busy about  the fence and quince bushes between the house and milk house, with her  beak full of coarse straw and hay. To a casual observer, she seemed  flitting about aimlessly, carrying straws from place to place just to  amuse herself. When I came to watch her closely to learn the place of  her nest, she seemed to suspect my intention, and made many little  feints and movements calculated to put me off my track. But I would not  be misled, and presently had her secret. The male did not assist her at  all, but sang much of the time in an apple-tree or upon the fence, on  the other side of the house.    The song sparrow nearly always builds upon the ground, but my little  neighbor laid the foundations of her domicile a foot or more above the  soil. And what a mass of straws and twigs she did collect together! How  coarse and careless and aimless at first,--a mere lot of rubbish dropped  upon the tangle of dry limbs; but presently how it began to refine and  come into shape in the centre! till there was the most exquisite  hair-lined cup set about by a chaos of coarse straws and branches. What  a process of evolution! The completed nest was foreshadowed by the first  stiff straw; but how far off is yet that dainty casket with its  complement of speckled eggs! The nest was so placed that it had for  canopy a large, broad, drooping leaf of yellow dock. This formed a  perfect shield against both sun and rain, while it served to conceal it  from any curious eyes from above,--from the cat, for instance, prowling  along the top of the wall. Before the eggs had hatched, the docken leaf  wilted and dried and fell down upon the nest. But the mother bird  managed to insinuate herself beneath it, and went on with her brooding  all the same.    Then I arranged an artificial cover of leaves and branches, which  shielded her charge till they had flown away. A mere trifle was this  little bob-tailed bird with her arts and her secrets, and the male with  his song, and yet the pair gave a touch of something to those days and  to that place which I would not willingly have missed.          THE CHIMNEY SWIFT      One day a swarm of honey-bees went into my chimney, and I mounted the  stack to see into which flue they had gone. As I craned my neck above  the sooty vent, with the bees humming about my ears, the first thing my  eye rested upon in the black interior was a pair of long white pearls  upon a little shelf of twigs, the nest of the chimney swallow, or  swift,--honey, soot, and birds' eggs closely associated. The bees,  though in an unused flue, soon found the gas of anthracite that hovered  about the top of the chimney too much for them, and they left. But the  swifts are not repelled by smoke. They seem to have entirely abandoned  their former nesting-places in hollow trees and stumps, and to frequent  only chimneys. A tireless bird, never perching, all day upon the wing,  and probably capable of flying one thousand miles in twenty-four hours,  they do not even stop to gather materials for their nests, but snap off  the small dry twigs from the tree-tops as they fly by. Confine one of  these swifts to a room and it does not perch, but after flying till it  becomes bewildered and exhausted, it clings to the side of the wall till  it dies. Once, on returning to my room after several days' absence, I  found one in which life seemed nearly extinct; its feet grasped my  finger as I removed it from the wall, but its eyes closed, and it seemed  about on the point of joining its companion, which lay dead upon the  floor. Tossing it into the air, however, seemed to awaken its wonderful  powers of flight, and away it went straight toward the clouds. On the  wing the chimney swift looks like an athlete stripped for the race.  There is the least appearance of quill and plumage of any of our birds,  and, with all its speed and marvelous evolutions, the effect of its  flight is stiff and wiry. There appears to be but one joint in the wing,  and that next the body. This peculiar inflexible motion of the wings, as  if they were little sickles of sheet iron, seems to be owing to the  length and development of the primary quills and the smallness of the  secondary. The wing appears to hinge only at the wrist. The barn swallow  lines its rude masonry with feathers, but the swift begins life on bare  twigs, glued together by a glue of home manufacture as adhesive as  Spaulding's.    The big chimney of my cabin \"Slabsides\" of course attracted the chimney  swifts, and as it was not used in summer, two pairs built their nests in  it, and we had the muffled thunder of their wings at all hours of the  day and night. One night, when one of the broods was nearly fledged, the  nest that held them fell down into the fireplace. Such a din of  screeching and chattering as they instantly set up! Neither my dog nor I  could sleep. They yelled in chorus, stopping at the end of every  half-minute as if upon signal. Now they were all screeching at the top  of their voices, then a sudden, dead silence ensued. Then the din began  again, to terminate at the instant as before. If they had been long  practicing together, they could not have succeeded better. I never  before heard the cry of birds so accurately timed. After a while I got  up and put them back up the chimney, and stopped up the throat of the  flue with newspapers. The next day one of the parent birds, in bringing  food to them, came down the chimney with such force that it passed  through the papers and brought up in the fireplace. On capturing it I  saw that its throat was distended with food as a chipmunk's cheek with  corn, or a boy's pocket with chestnuts. I opened its mandibles, when it  ejected a wad of insects as large as a bean. Most of them were much  macerated, but there were two house-flies yet alive and but little the  worse for their close confinement. They stretched themselves and walked  about upon my hand, enjoying a breath of fresh air once more. It was  nearly two hours before the swift again ventured into the chimney with  food.    These birds do not perch, nor alight upon buildings or the ground. They  are apparently upon the wing all day. They outride the storms. I have in  my mind a cheering picture of three of them I saw facing a heavy  thunder-shower one afternoon. The wind was blowing a gale, the clouds  were rolling in black, portentous billows out of the west, the peals of  thunder were shaking the heavens, and the big drops were just beginning  to come down, when, on looking up, I saw three swifts high in air,  working their way slowly, straight into the teeth of the storm. They  were not hurried or disturbed; they held themselves firmly and steadily;  indeed, they were fairly at anchor in the air till the rage of the  elements should have subsided. I do not know that any other of our land  birds outride the storms in this way.    In the choice of nesting-material the swift shows no change of habit.  She still snips off the small dry twigs from the tree-tops and glues  them together, and to the side of the chimney, with her own glue. The  soot is a new obstacle in her way, that she does not yet seem to have  learned to overcome, as the rains often loosen it and cause her nest to  fall to the bottom. She has a pretty way of trying to frighten you off  when your head suddenly darkens the opening above her. At such times she  leaves the nest and clings to the side of the chimney near it. Then,  slowly raising her wings, she suddenly springs out from the wall and  back again, making as loud a drumming with them in the passage as she is  capable of. If this does not frighten you away, she repeats it three or  four times. If your face still hovers above her, she remains quiet and  watches you.    What a creature of the air this bird is, never touching the ground, so  far as I know, and never tasting earthly food! The swallow does perch  now and then and descend to the ground for nesting-material, but not so  the swift. The twigs for her nest she gathers on the wing, sweeping  along like children on a \"merry-go-round\" who try to seize a ring, or to  do some other feat, as they pass a given point. If the swift misses the  twig, or it fails to yield to her the first time, she tries again and  again, each time making a wider circuit, as if to tame and train her  steed a little and bring him up more squarely to the mark next time.    Though the swift is a stiff flyer and apparently without joints in her  wings, yet the air of frolic and of superabundance of wing-power is  more marked with her than with any other of our birds. Her feeding and  twig-gathering seem like asides in a life of endless play. Several times  both in spring and fall I have seen swifts gather in immense numbers  toward "]]]
