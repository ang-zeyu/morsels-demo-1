'A half-a-quid to me he cast,     I wanted it indeed.    So help me Bob, for two days past     I haven't had a feed.      'But still I thought my luck was in,     I couldn't go astray,    I put it all on Little Min,     And lost it straightaway.      'I haven't got a bite or bed,     I'm absolutely stuck,    So keep this lesson in your head:     Don't over-trust your luck!'      The folks went homeward, near and far,     The tout, Oh! where was he?    Ask where the empty boilers are,     Beside the Circular Quay.          Song of the Federation          As the nations sat together, grimly waiting --     The fierce old nations battle-scarred --    Grown grey in their lusting and their hating,     Ever armed and ever ready keeping guard,    Through the tumult of their warlike preparation     And the half-stilled clamour of the drums    Came a voice crying, 'Lo! a new-made nation,     To her place in the sisterhood she comes!'      And she came -- she was beautiful as morning,     With the bloom of the roses in her mouth,    Like a young queen lavishly adorning     Her charms with the splendours of the South.    And the fierce old nations, looking on her,     Said, 'Nay, surely she were quickly overthrown,    Hath she strength for the burden laid upon her,     Hath she power to protect and guard her own?      Then she spoke, and her voice was clear and ringing     In the ears of the nations old and gray,    Saying, 'Hark, and ye shall hear my children singing     Their war-song in countries far away.    They are strangers to the tumult of the battle,     They are few but their hearts are very strong,    'Twas but yesterday they called unto the cattle,     But they now sing Australia's marching song.'                 Song of the Australians in Action             For the honour of Australia, our mother,          Side by side with our kin from over sea,         We have fought and we have tested one another,          And enrolled among the brotherhood are we.           There was never post of danger but we sought it          In the fighting, through the fire, and through the flood.         There was never prize so costly but we bought it,          Though we paid for its purchase with our blood.           Was there any road too rough for us to travel?          Was there any path too far for us to tread?         You can track us by the blood drops on the gravel          On the roads that we milestoned with our dead!           And for you, oh our young and anxious mother,          O'er your great gains keeping watch and ward,         Neither fearing nor despising any other,          We will hold your possessions with the sword.                .    .    .    .    .      Then they passed to the place of world-long sleeping,     The grey-clad figures with their dead,    To the sound of their women softly weeping     And the Dead March moaning at their head:    And the Nations, as the grim procession ended,     Whispered, 'Child!  But ye have seen the price we pay,    From War may we ever be defended,     Kneel ye down, new-made Sister -- Let us Pray!'          The Old Australian Ways          The London lights are far abeam     Behind a bank of cloud,    Along the shore the gaslights gleam,     The gale is piping loud;    And down the Channel, groping blind,     We drive her through the haze    Towards the land we left behind --    The good old land of 'never mind',     And old Australian ways.      The narrow ways of English folk     Are not for such as we;    They bear the long-accustomed yoke     Of staid conservancy:    But all our roads are new and strange,     And through our blood there runs    The vagabonding love of change    That drove us westward of the range     And westward of the suns.      The city folk go to and fro     Behind a prison's bars,    They never feel the breezes blow     And never see the stars;    They never hear in blossomed trees     The music low and sweet    Of wild birds making melodies,    Nor catch the little laughing breeze     That whispers in the wheat.      Our fathers came of roving stock     That could not fixed abide:    And we have followed field and flock     Since e'er we learnt to ride;    By miner's camp and shearing shed,     In land of heat and drought,    We followed where our fortunes led,    With fortune always on ahead     And always further out.      The wind is in the barley-grass,     The wattles are in bloom;    The breezes greet us as they pass     With honey-sweet perfume;    The parakeets go screaming by     With flash of golden wing,    And from the swamp the wild-ducks cry    Their long-drawn note of revelry,     Rejoicing at the Spring.      So throw the weary pen aside     And let the papers rest,    For we must saddle up and ride     Towards the blue hill's breast;    And we must travel far and fast     Across their rugged maze,    To find the Spring of Youth at last,    And call back from the buried past     The old Australian ways.      When Clancy took the drover's track     In years of long ago,    He drifted to the outer back     Beyond the Overflow;    By rolling plain and rocky shelf,     With stockwhip in his hand,    He reached at last, oh lucky elf,    The Town of Come-and-help-yourself     In Rough-and-ready Land.      And if it be that you would know     The tracks he used to ride,    Then you must saddle up and go     Beyond the Queensland side --    Beyond the reach of rule or law,     To ride the long day through,    In Nature's homestead -- filled with awe    You then might see what Clancy saw     And know what Clancy knew.          The Ballad of the 'Calliope'              By the far Samoan shore,        Where the league-long rollers pour    All the wash of the Pacific on the coral-guarded bay,        Riding lightly at their ease,        In the calm of tropic seas,    The three great nations' warships at their anchors proudly lay.          Riding lightly, head to wind,        With the coral reefs behind,    Three Germans and three Yankee ships were mirrored in the blue;        And on one ship unfurled        Was the flag that rules the world --    For on the old 'Calliope' the flag of England flew.          When the gentle off-shore breeze,        That had scarcely stirred the trees,    Dropped down to utter stillness, and the glass began to fall,        Away across the main        Lowered the coming hurricane,    And far away to seaward hung the cloud wrack like a pall.          If the word had passed around,        'Let us move to safer ground;    Let us steam away to seaward' -- then this tale were not to tell!        But each Captain seemed to say        'If the others stay, I stay!'    And they lingered at their moorings till the shades of evening fell.          Then the cloud wrack neared them fast,        And there came a sudden blast,    And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand miles of main!        Like a lion on its prey,        Leapt the storm fiend on the bay,    And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables felt the strain.          As the surging seas came by,        That were running mountains high,    The vessels started dragging, drifting slowly to the lee;        And the darkness of the night        Hid the coral reefs from sight,    And the Captains dared not risk the chance to grope their way to sea.          In the dark they dared not shift!        They were forced to wait and drift;    All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold or no.        But the men on deck could see        If a chance of hope might be --    There was little chance of safety for the men who were below.          Through that long, long night of dread,        While the storm raged overhead,    They were waiting by their engines, with the furnace fires aroar.        So they waited, staunch and true,        Though they knew, and well they knew,    They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel touched the shore.          When the grey dawn broke at last,        And the long, long night was past,    While the hurricane redoubled, lest its prey should steal away,        On the rocks, all smashed and strewn,        Were the German vessels thrown,    While the Yankees, swamped and helpless, drifted shorewards down the bay.          Then at last spoke Captain Kane,        'All our anchors are in vain,    And the Germans and the Yankees they have drifted to the lee!        Cut the cables at the bow!        We must trust the engines now!    Give her steam, and let her have it, lads, we'll fight her out to sea!'          And the answer came with cheers        From the stalwart engineers,    From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces below;        And above the sullen roar        Of the breakers on the shore    Came the throbbing of the engines as they laboured to and fro.          If the strain should find a flaw,        Should a bolt or rivet draw,    Then -- God help them! for the vessel were a plaything in the tide!        With a face of honest cheer,        Quoth an English engineer,    'I will answer for the engines that were built on old Thames side!          'For the stays and stanchions taut,        For the rivets truly wrought,    For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should fit the hand.        Give her every ounce of power,        If we make a knot an hour    Then it's way enough to steer her and we'll drive her from the land.'          Like a foam flake tossed and thrown,        She could barely hold her own,    While the other ships all helplessly were drifting to the lee.        Through the smother and the rout        The 'Calliope' steamed out --    And they cheered her from the Trenton that was foundering in the sea.          Aye! drifting shoreward there,        All helpless as they were,    Their vessel hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore is hurled.        Without a thought of fear        The Yankees raised a cheer --    A cheer that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30427"],[0,"The Lost Kafoozalum (#8)"],[1,"to _Gilgamesh_ as at present, to  a point seventy miles above the planetary surface. It will then  uncouple, discharge one hopper, and go back on Mass-Time. Estimated  time for this stage of descent forty minutes.    \"Three. The hopper will then descend on its own engines at the maximum  speed allowed by the heat-disposal system; estimated at thirty-seven  minutes. _Gilgamesh_ will complete descent in thirty-three minutes.  Engines of _Gilgamesh_ will not be used except for the heat-disposal  and gyro auxiliaries. The following installations have been made to  allow for the control of the descent; a ring of eight rockets in  peltathene mounts around the tail and, and one outsize antigrav unit  inside the nose. \"Sympathizer\" controls hooked up with a visiscreen  and a computer have also been installed in the nose.    \"Four. _Gilgamesh_ will carry one man only. The hopper will carry a  crew of three. The pilot of _Gilgamesh_ will establish the ship on the  edge of the cliff, supported on antigrav a foot or so above the ground  and leaning towards the sea at an angle of approximately 20 deg. with the  vertical. Except for this landing will be automatic.    \"Five.\"    The colonel's voice has lulled us into passive acceptance; now we are  jerked into sharper attention by the faintest possible check in it.    \"The greatest danger attaching to the expedition is that the  Incognitans may discover that the crash has been faked. This would be  inevitable if they were to capture (a) the hopper; (b) any of the new  installations in Gilgamesh, especially the antigrav; (c) any member of  the crew.    \"The function of the hopper is to pick up the pilot of _Gilgamesh_ and  also to check that ground appearances are consistent. If not, they  will produce a landslip on the cliff edge, using power tools and  explosives carried for the purpose. That is why the hopper has a crew  of three, but the chance of their having to do this is slight.\"    So I should think; ground appearances are supposed to show that  _Gilgamesh_ landed using emergency rockets and then toppled over the  cliff and this will be exactly what happened.    \"The pilot will carry a one-frequency low-power transmitter activated  by the change in magnetic field on leaving the ship. The hopper will  remain at five hundred feet until this signal is received. It will  then pick up the pilot, check ground appearances, and rendezvous with  this ship at two hundred miles up at 18.27 hours.\"    The ship and the hopper both being radar-absorbent will not register  on alarm systems, and by keeping to planetary nighttime they should  be safe from being seen.    \"Danger (b) will be dealt with as follows. The rocket-mounts being of  peltathene will be destroyed by half an hour's immersion in water. The  installations in the nose will be destroyed with Andite.\"    Andite produces complete colecular disruption in a very short range,  hardly any damage outside it; the effect will be as though the nose  broke off on impact; I suppose the Incognitans will waste a lot of  time looking for it on the bed of the sea.    \"Four ten-centimeter cartridges will be inserted within the nose  installations. The fuse will have two alternative settings. The first  will be timed to act at 12.50 hours, seven minutes after the estimated  time of landing. It will not be possible to deactivate it before 12.45  hours. This takes care of the possibility of the pilot's becoming  incapacitated during the descent.    \"Having switched off the first fuse the pilot will get the ship into  position and then activate a second, timed to blow in ten minutes. He  will then leave the ship. When the antigrav is destroyed the ship  will, of course, fall into the sea.    \"Six. The pilot of _Gilgamesh_ will wear a spacesuit of the pattern  used by the original crew and will carry Personal Background Set  number 23. Should he fail to escape from the ship the crew of the  hopper will on no account attempt to rescue him.\"    The colonel takes up the paper, folds it in half and puts it down one  inch further away.    \"The hopper's crew,\" he says, \"will give the whole game away should  one of them fall into Incognitan hands, alive or dead. Therefore they  don't take any risks of it.\"    He lifts his gaze ceilingwards. \"I'm asking for three volunteers.\"    Silence. Manning the hopper is definitely second best. Then light  suddenly bursts on me and I lift my hand and hack B on the ankle.    \"I volunteer,\" I say.    B gives me a most dubious glance and then lifts her hand, too.    Cray on the other side of the table is slowly opening his mouth when  there is an outburst of waving on the far side of B.    \"Me too, colonel! I volunteer!\"    Mr. Yardo proceeds to explain that his special job is over and done,  he can be more easily spared than anybody, he may be too old to take  charge of _Gilgamesh_ but will back himself as a hopper pilot against  anybody.    The colonel cuts this short by accepting all three. He then unfolds  his paper again.    \"Piloting _Gilgamesh_,\" he says. \"I'm not asking for volunteers now.  You'll go to your cabins in four hours' time and those who want to  will volunteer, secretly. To a computer hookup, Computer will select  on a random basis and notify the one chosen. Give him his final  instructions, too. No one need know who it was till it's all over. He  can tell anyone he likes, of course.\"    [Illustration]    A very slight note of triumph creeps into the next remark. \"One point.  Only men need volunteer.\"    Instant outcry from Kirsty and Dilly: B turns to me with a look of  awe.    \"Nothing to do with prejudice,\" says the colonel testily. \"Just facts.  The crew of _Gilgamesh_ were all men. Can't risk one solitary woman  being found on board. Besides--spacesuits, personal background  sets--all designed for men.\"    Kirsty and Dilly turn on me looks designed to shrivel and B whispers  \"Lizzie how wonderful you are.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The session dissolves. We three get an intensive session course of  instruction on our duties and are ordered off to sleep. After  breakfast next morning I run into Cray who says, Before I continue  about what is evidently pressing business would I care to kick him,  hard?    Not right now I reply, what for anyway?    \"Miss Lee,\" says Cray, dragging it out longer than ever, \"although I  have long realized that your brain functions in a way much superior to  logic I had not sense enough yesterday to follow my own instinct and  do what you do as soon as you did it; therefore that dessicated meat  handler got in first.\"    I say: \"So you weren't picked for pilot? It was only one chance in  ten.\"    \"Oh,\" says Cray, \"did you really think so?\" He gives me a long look  and goes away.    I suppose he noticed that when the colonel came out with his remarks  about No women in Gilgamesh I was as surprised as any.    Presently the three of us are issued with protective clothing; we just  might have to venture out on the planet's surface and therefore we get  white one-piece suits to protect against Cold, heat, moisture,  dessication, radioactivity, and mosquitoes, and they are quite  becoming, really.    [Illustration]    B and I drag out dressing for thirty minutes; then we just sit while  Time crawls asymptotically towards the hour.    Then the speaker calls us to go.    We are out of the cabin before it says two words and racing for the  hold; so that we are just in time to see a figure out of an Historical  movie--padded, jointed, tin bowl for head and blank reflecting glass  where the face should be--stepping through the air lock.    The colonel and Mr. Yardo are there already. The colonel packs us into  the hopper and personally closes the door, and for once I know what  he is thinking; he is wishing he were not the only pilot in this ship  who could possibly rely on bringing the ship off and on Mass-Time at  one particular defined spot of Space.    Then he leaves us; half an hour to go.    The light in the hold begins to alter. Instead of being softly  diffused it separates into sharp-edged beams, reflecting and  crisscrossing but leaving cones of shadow between. The air is being  pumped into store.    Fifteen minutes.    The hull vibrates and a hatch slides open in the floor so that the  black of Space looks through; it closes again.    Mr. Yardo lifts the hopper gently off its mounts and lets it back  again.    Testing; five minutes to go.    I am hypnotized by my chronometer; the hands are crawling through  glue; I am still staring at it when, at the exact second, we go off  Mass-Time.    No weight. I hook my heels under the seat and persuade my esophagus  back into place. A new period of waiting has begun. Every so often  comes the impression we are falling head-first; the colonel using  ship's drive to decelerate the whole system. Then more free fall.    The hopper drifts very slowly out into the hold and hovers over the  hatch, and the lights go. There is only the glow from the visiscreen  and the instrument board.    One minute thirty seconds to go.    The hatch slides open again. I take a deep breath.    I am still holding it when the colonel's voice comes over the speaker:  \"Calling _Gilgamesh_. Calling the hopper. Good-by and Good luck.  You're on your own.\"    The ship is gone.    Yet another stretch of time has been marked off for us. Thirty-seven  minutes, the least time allowable if we are not to get overheated by  friction with the air. Mr. Yardo is a good pilot; he is concentrating  wholly on the visiscreen and the thermometer. B and I are free to look  around.    I see nothing and say so.    I did not know or have forgotten that Incognita has many small  satellites; from here there are four in sight.           *       *       *       *       *    I am still looking at them when B seizes my arm painfully and points  below us.    I see nothing and say so.    B whispers it was there a moment ago, it is pretty cloudy down  "]]]
