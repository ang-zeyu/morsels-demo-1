In 1563 he observed a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, the precursor,  and _cause_ as he thought it, of the great plague. He found that the old  planetary tables were as much as a month in error in fixing this event,  and even the Copernican tables were several days out; so he formed the  resolve to devote his life to improving astronomical tables. This  resolve he executed with a vengeance. His first instrument was a jointed  ruler with sights for fixing the position of planets with respect to the  stars, and observing their stations and retrogressions. By thus  measuring the angles between a planet and two fixed stars, its position  can be plotted down on a celestial map or globe.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Portrait of Tycho.]    In 1565 his uncle George died, and made Tycho his heir. He returned to  Denmark, but met with nothing but ridicule and contempt for his absurd  drivelling away of time over useless pursuits. So he went back to  Germany--first to Wittenberg, thence, driven by the plague, to Rostock.    Here his fiery nature led him into an absurd though somewhat dangerous  adventure. A quarrel at some feast, on a mathematical point, with a  countryman, Manderupius, led to the fixing of a duel, and it was fought  with swords at 7 p.m. at the end of December, when, if there was any  light at all, it must have been of a flickering and unsatisfactory  nature. The result of this insane performance was that Tycho got his  nose cut clean off.    He managed however to construct an artificial one, some say of gold and  silver, some say of putty and brass; but whatever it was made of there  is no doubt that he wore it for the rest of his life, and it is a most  famous feature. It excited generally far more interest than his  astronomical researches. It is said, moreover, to have very fairly  resembled the original, but whether this remark was made by a friend or  by an enemy I cannot say. One account says that he used to carry about  with him a box of cement to apply whenever his nose came off, which it  periodically did.    About this time he visited Augsburg, met with some kindred and  enlightened spirits in that town, and with much enthusiasm and spirit  constructed a great quadrant. These early instruments were tremendous  affairs. A great number of workmen were employed upon this quadrant, and  it took twenty men to carry it to its place and erect it. It stood in  the open air for five years, and then was destroyed by a storm. With it  he made many observations.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Early out-door quadrant of Tycho; for  observing altitudes by help of the sights _D_, _L_ and the plumb line.]    On his return to Denmark in 1571, his fame preceded him, and he was  much better received; and in order to increase his power of constructing  instruments he took up the study of alchemy, and like the rest of the  persuasion tried to make gold. The precious metals were by many old  philosophers considered to be related in some way to the heavenly  bodies: silver to the moon, for instance--as we still see by the name  lunar caustic applied to nitrate of silver; gold to the sun, copper to  Mars, lead to Saturn. Hence astronomy and alchemy often went together.  Tycho all his life combined a little alchemy with his astronomical  labours, and he constructed a wonderful patent medicine to cure all  disorders, which had as wide a circulation in Europe in its time as  Holloway's pills; he gives a tremendous receipt for it, with liquid gold  and all manner of ingredients in it; among them, however, occurs a  little antimony--a well-known sudorific--and to this, no doubt, whatever  efficacy the medicine possessed was due.    So he might have gone on wasting his time, were it not that in November,  1572, a new star made its appearance, as they have done occasionally  before and since. On the average one may say that about every fifty  years a new star of fair magnitude makes its temporary appearance. They  are now known to be the result of some catastrophe or collision, whereby  immense masses of incandescent gas are produced. This one seen by Tycho  became as bright as Jupiter, and then died away in about a year and a  half. Tycho observed all its changes, and endeavoured to measure its  distance from the earth, with the result that it was proved to belong to  the region of the fixed stars, at an immeasurable distance, and was not  some nearer and more trivial phenomenon.    He was asked by the University of Copenhagen to give a course of  lectures on astronomy; but this was a step he felt some aristocratic  aversion to, until a little friendly pressure was brought to bear upon  him by a request from the king, and delivered they were.    He now seems to have finally thrown off his aristocratic prejudices, and  to have indulged himself in treading on the corns of nearly all the high  and mighty people he came into contact with. In short, he became what we  might now call a violent Radical; but he was a good-hearted man,  nevertheless, and many are the tales told of his visits to sick  peasants, of his consulting the stars as to their fate--all in perfect  good faith--and of the medicines which he concocted and prescribed for  them.    The daughter of one of these peasants he married, and very happy the  marriage seems to have been.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Map of Denmark, showing the island of Huen.    _Walker & Boutallse._]    Now comes the crowning episode in Tycho's life. Frederick II., realizing  how eminent a man they had among them, and how much he could do if only  he had the means--for we must understand that Tycho, though of good  family and well off, was by no means what we would call a wealthy  man--Frederick II. made him a splendid and enlightened offer. The offer  was this: that if Tycho would agree to settle down and make his  astronomical observations in Denmark, he should have an estate in Norway  settled upon him, a pension of L400 a year for life, a site for a large  observatory, and L20,000 to build it with.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Uraniburg.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Astrolabe. An old instrument with sights for  marking the positions of the celestial bodies roughly. A sort of  skeleton celestial globe.]    [Illustration:      SEXTANS ASTRONOMICVS    TRIGONICVS PRO DISTANTIIS    rimandis.    FIG. 22.--Tycho's large sextant; for measuring the angular distance  between two bodies by direct sighting.]    Well, if ever money was well spent, this was. By its means Denmark  before long headed the nations of Europe in the matter of science--a  thing it has not done before or since. The site granted was the island  of Huen, between Copenhagen and Elsinore; and here the most magnificent  observatory ever built was raised, and called Uraniburg--the castle of  the heavens. It was built on a hill in the centre of the island, and  included gardens, printing shops, laboratory, dwelling-houses, and four  observatories--all furnished with the most splendid instruments that  Tycho could devise, and that could then be constructed. It was decorated  with pictures and sculptures of eminent men, and altogether was a most  gorgeous place. L20,000 no doubt went far in those days, but the  original grant was supplemented by Tycho himself, who is said to have  spent another equal sum out of his own pocket on the place.    [Illustration: QVADRANS MAXIMVS CHALIBEUS QUADRATO INCLUSUS, ET  Horizonti Azimuthali chalybeo insistens.    FIG. 23.--The Quadrant in Uraniburg; or altitude and azimuth  instrument.]    For twenty years this great temple of science was continually worked in  by him, and he soon became the foremost scientific man in Europe.  Philosophers, statesmen, and occasionally kings, came to visit the great  astronomer, and to inspect his curiosities.    [Illustration:      QVADRANS MVRALIS    SIVE TICHONICUS.    FIG. 24.--Tycho's form of transit circle.    The method of utilising the extremely uniform rotation of the earth by  watching the planets and stars as they cross the meridian, and recording  their times of transit; observing also at the same time their meridian  altitudes (see observer _F_), was the invention of Tycho, and  constitutes his greatest achievement. His method is followed to this day  in all observatories.]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--A modern transit circle, showing essentially  the same parts as in Tycho's instrument, viz. the observer watching the  transit, the clock, the recorder of the observation, and the graduated  circle; the latter to be read by a second observer.]    And very wholesome for some of these great personages must have been the  treatment they met with. For Tycho was no respecter of persons. His  humbly-born wife sat at the head of the table, whoever was there; and he  would snub and contradict a chancellor just as soon as he would a serf.  Whatever form his pride may have taken when a youth, in his maturity it  impelled him to ignore differences of rank not substantially justified,  and he seemed to take a delight in exposing the ignorance of shallow  titled persons, to whom contradiction and exposure were most unusual  experiences.    For sick peasants he would take no end of trouble, and went about  doctoring them for nothing, till he set all the professional doctors  against him; so that when his day of misfortune came, as come it did,  their influence was not wanting to help to ruin one who spoilt their  practice, and whom they derided as a quack.    But some of the great ignorant folk who came to visit his temple of  science, and to inspect its curiosities, felt themselves insulted--not  always without reason. He kept a tame maniac in the house, named Lep,  and he used to regard the sayings of this personage as oracular,  presaging future events, and far better worth listening to than ordinary  conversation. Consequently he used to have him at his banquets and feed  him himself; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28617"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 1930 (#8)"],[1,"are  feeling us out,\" said the Secretary. They had stopped more than once for  gas and for wireless reports. He held a sheaf of typewritten briefs.    \"Going slowly south. They have taken their time. Hours over San  Francisco and the bay district. Repeating same tactics; fall with  terrific speed to cushion against their blast of gas. Trying to draw us  out, provoke an attack, make us show our strength. Well, we shall beat  them to San Diego at this rate. We'll be there in a few hours.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The afternoon sun was dropping ahead of them when they sighted the  water. \"Eckener Pass,\" the pilot told them, \"where the Graf Zeppelin  came through. Wonder what these birds would think of a Zepp!    \"There's the ocean,\" he added after a time. San Diego glistened against  the bare hills. \"There's North Island--the Army field.\" He stared  intently ahead, then shouted: \"And there they are! Look there!\"    Over the city a cluster of meteors was falling. Dark underneath, their  tops shone like pure silver in the sun's slanting glare. They fell  toward the city, then buried themselves in a dense cloud of steam,  rebounding at once to the upper air, vapor trailing behind them.    The cloud billowed slowly. It struck the hills of the city, then lifted  and vanished.    \"Land at once,\" requested the Secretary. A flash of silver countermanded  the order.    It hung there before them, a great gleaming globe, keeping always its  distance ahead. It was elongated at the base, Thurston observed. From  that base shot the familiar blast that turned steamy a hundred feet  below as it chilled the warm air. There were round orifices, like ports,  ranged around the top, where an occasional jet of vapor showed this to  be a method of control. Other spots shone dark and glassy. Were they  windows? He hardly realized their peril, so interested was he in the  strange machine ahead.           *       *       *       *       *    Then: \"Dodge that vapor,\" ordered General Lozier. The plane wavered in  signal to the others and swung sharply to the left. Each man knew the  flaming death that was theirs if the fire of their exhaust touched that  explosive mixture of hydrogen and air. The great bubble turned with them  and paralleled their course.    \"He's watching us,\" said Riley, \"giving us the once over, the slimy  devil. Ain't there a gun on this ship?\"    The General addressed his superior. Even above the roar of the motors  his voice seemed quiet, assured. \"We must not land now,\" he said. \"We  can't land at North Island. It would focus their attention upon our  defenses. That thing--whatever it is--is looking for a vulnerable spot.  We must.... Hold on--there he goes!\"    The big bulb shot upward. It slanted above them, and hovered there.    \"I think he is about to attack,\" said the General quietly. And, to the  commander of their squadron: \"It's in your hands now, Captain. It's  your fight.\"    The Captain nodded and squinted above. \"He's got to throw heavier stuff  than that,\" he remarked. A small object was falling from the cloud. It  passed close to their ship.    \"Half-pint size,\" said Cyrus Thurston, and laughed in derision. There  was something ludicrous in the futility of the attack. He stuck his head  from a window into the gale they created. He sheltered his eyes to try  to follow the missile in its fall.           *       *       *       *       *    They were over the city. The criss-cross of streets made a grill-work of  lines; tall buildings were dwarfed from this three thousand foot  altitude. The sun slanted across a projecting promontory to make golden  ripples on a blue sea and the city sparkled back in the clear air. Tiny  white faces were massed in the streets, huddled in clusters where the  futile black missile had vanished.    And then--then the city was gone....    A white cloud-bank billowed and mushroomed. Slowly, it seemed to the  watcher--so slowly.    It was done in the fraction of a second. Yet in that brief time his eyes  registered the chaotic sweep in advance of the cloud. There came a  crashing of buildings in some monster whirlwind, a white cloud engulfing  it all.... It was rising--was on them.    \"God,\" thought Thurston, \"why can't I move!\" The plane lifted and  lurched. A thunder of sound crashed against them, an intolerable force.  They were crushed to the floor as the plane was hurled over and upward.    Out of the mad whirling tangle of flying bodies, Thurston glimpsed one  clear picture. The face of the pilot hung battered and blood-covered  before him, and over the limp body the hand of Slim Riley clutched at  the switch.    \"Bully boy,\" he said dazedly, \"he's cutting the motors....\" The thought  ended in blackness.    There was no sound of engines or beating propellers when he came to his  senses. Something lay heavy upon him. He pushed it to one side. It was  the body of General Lozier.           *       *       *       *       *    He drew himself to his knees to look slowly about, rubbed stupidly at  his eyes to quiet the whirl, then stared at the blood on his hand. It  was so quiet--the motors--what was it that happened? Slim had reached  for the switch....    The whirling subsided. Before him he saw Slim Riley at the controls. He  got to his feet and went unsteadily forward. It was a battered face that  was lifted to his.    \"She was spinning,\" the puffed lips were muttering slowly. \"I brought  her out ... there's the field....\" His voice was thick; he formed the  words slowly, painfully. \"Got to land ... can you take it? I'm--I'm--\"  He slumped limply in his seat.    Thurston's arms were uninjured. He dragged the pilot to the floor and  got back of the wheel. The field was below them. There were planes  taxiing out; he heard the roar of their motors. He tried the controls.  The plane answered stiffly, but he managed to level off as the brown  field approached.    Thurston never remembered that landing. He was trying to drag Riley from  the battered plane when the first man got to him.    \"Secretary of War?\" he gasped. \"In there.... Take Riley; I can walk.\"    \"We'll get them,\" an officer assured him. \"Knew you were coming. They  sure gave you hell! But look at the city!\"    Arms carried him stumbling from the field. Above the low hangars he saw  smoke clouds over the bay. These and red rolling flames marked what had  been an American city. Far in the heavens moved five glinting specks.    His head reeled with the thunder of engines. There were planes standing  in lines and more erupting from hangars, where khaki-clad men, faces  tense under leather helmets, rushed swiftly about.    \"General Lozier is dead,\" said a voice. Thurston turned to the man. They  were bringing the others. \"The rest are smashed up some,\" the officer  told him, \"but I think they'll pull through.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Secretary of War for the United States lay beside him. Men with red  on their sleeves were slitting his coat. Through one good eye he  squinted at Thurston. He even managed a smile.    \"Well, I wanted to see them up close,\" he said. \"They say you saved us,  old man.\"    Thurston waved that aside. \"Thank Riley--\" he began, but the words ended  in the roar of an exhaust. A plane darted swiftly away to shoot  vertically a hundred feet in the air. Another followed and another. In a  cloud of brown dust they streamed endlessly out, zooming up like angry  hornets, eager to get into the fight.    \"Fast little devils!\" the ambulance man observed. \"Here come the big  boys.\"    A leviathan went deafeningly past. And again others came on in quick  succession. Farther up the field, silvery gray planes with rudders  flaunting their red, white and blue rose circling to the heights.    \"That's the Navy,\" was the explanation. The surgeon straightened the  Secretary's arm. \"See them come off the big airplane carriers!\"    If his remarks were part of his professional training in removing a  patient's thoughts from his pain, they were effective. The Secretary  stared out to sea, where two great flat-decked craft were shooting  planes with the regularity of a rapid fire gun. They stood out sharply  against a bank of gray fog. Cyrus Thurston forgot his bruised body,  forgot his own peril--even the inferno that raged back across the bay:  he was lost in the sheer thrill of the spectacle.           *       *       *       *       *    Above them the sky was alive with winged shapes. And from all the  disorder there was order appearing. Squadron after squadron swept to  battle formation. Like flights of wild ducks the true sharp-pointed Vs  soared off into the sky. Far above and beyond, rows of dots marked the  race of swift scouts for the upper levels. And high in the clear air  shone the glittering menace trailing their five plumes of gas.    A deeper detonation was merging into the uproar. It came from the ships,  Thurston knew, where anti-aircraft guns poured a rain of shells into the  sky. About the invaders they bloomed into clusters of smoke balls. The  globes shot a thousand feet into the air. Again the shells found them,  and again they retreated.    \"Look!\" said Thurston. \"They got one!\"    He groaned as a long curving arc of speed showed that the big bulb was  under control. Over the ships it paused, to balance and swing, then shot  to the zenith as one of the great boats exploded in a cloud of vapor.    The following blast swept the airdrome. Planes yet on the ground went  like dry autumn leaves. The hangars were flattened.    Thurston cowered in awe. They were sheltered, he saw, by a slope of the  ground. No ridicule now for the bombs!    A second blast marked when the gas-cloud ignited. The billowing flames  were blue. They writhed in tortured convulsions through the air. Endless  explosions merged into one rumbling roar.    MacGregor had roused from his stupor; he raised to a sitting position.    \"Hydrogen,\" he stated positively, and pointed"]]]
