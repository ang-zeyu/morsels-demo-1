The third Whitehall received nine prisoners  only--a catch of twenty-nine in all.    \"You didn't get the Porpoise,\" the Centipede said exultantly, as  though his escape materially diminished our success.    Charley laughed. \"But we saw him just the same, a-snorting for shore  like a puffing pig.\"    It was a mild and shivering band of pirates that we marched up the  beach to the oyster house. In answer to Charley's knock, the door was  flung open, and a pleasant wave of warm air rushed out upon us.    \"You can dry your clothes here, lads, and get some hot coffee,\"  Charley announced, as they filed in.    And there, sitting ruefully by the fire, with a steaming mug in his  hand, was the Porpoise. With one accord Nicholas and I looked at  Charley. He laughed gleefully.    \"That comes of imagination,\" he said. \"When you see a thing, you've  got to see it all around, or what's the good of seeing it at all? I  saw the beach, so I left a couple of constables behind to keep an eye  on it. That's all.\"          IV    THE SIEGE OF THE \"LANCASHIRE QUEEN\"      Possibly our most exasperating experience on the fish patrol was when  Charley Le Grant and I laid a two weeks' siege to a big four-masted  English ship. Before we had finished with the affair, it became a  pretty mathematical problem, and it was by the merest chance that we  came into possession of the instrument that brought it to a successful  termination.    After our raid on the oyster pirates we had returned to Oakland, where  two more weeks passed before Neil Partington's wife was out of danger  and on the highroad to recovery. So it was after an absence of a  month, all told, that we turned the _Reindeer's_ nose toward Benicia.  When the cat's away the mice will play, and in these four weeks the  fishermen had become very bold in violating the law. When we passed  Point Pedro we noticed many signs of activity among the  shrimp-catchers, and, well into San Pablo Bay, we observed a widely  scattered fleet of Upper Bay fishing-boats hastily pulling in their  nets and getting up sail.    This was suspicious enough to warrant investigation, and the first and  only boat we succeeded in boarding proved to have an illegal net. The  law permitted no smaller mesh for catching shad than one that measured  seven and one-half inches inside the knots, while the mesh of this  particular net measured only three inches. It was a flagrant breach of  the rules, and the two fishermen were forthwith put under arrest.  Neil Partington took one of them with him to help manage the  _Reindeer_, while Charley and I went on ahead with the other in the  captured boat.    But the shad fleet had headed over toward the Petaluma shore in wild  flight, and for the rest of the run through San Pablo Bay we saw no  more fishermen at all. Our prisoner, a bronzed and bearded Greek, sat  sullenly on his net while we sailed his craft. It was a new Columbia  River salmon boat, evidently on its first trip, and it handled  splendidly. Even when Charley praised it, our prisoner refused to  speak or to notice us, and we soon gave him up as a most unsociable  fellow.    We ran up the Carquinez Straits and edged into the bight at Turner's  Shipyard for smoother water. Here were lying several English steel  sailing ships, waiting for the wheat harvest; and here, most  unexpectedly, in the precise place where we had captured Big Alec, we  came upon two Italians in a skiff that was loaded with a complete  \"Chinese\" sturgeon line. The surprise was mutual, and we were on top  of them before either they or we were aware. Charley had barely time  to luff into the wind and run up to them. I ran forward and tossed  them a line with orders to make it fast. One of the Italians took a  turn with it over a cleat, while I hastened to lower our big  spritsail. This accomplished, the salmon boat dropped astern, dragging  heavily on the skiff.    Charley came forward to board the prize, but when I proceeded to haul  alongside by means of the line, the Italians cast it off. We at once  began drifting to leeward, while they got out two pairs of oars and  rowed their light craft directly into the wind. This manoeuvre for the  moment disconcerted us, for in our large and heavily loaded boat we  could not hope to catch them with the oars. But our prisoner came  unexpectedly to our aid. His black eyes were flashing eagerly, and his  face was flushed with suppressed excitement, as he dropped the  centreboard, sprang forward with a single leap, and put up the sail.    \"I've always heard that Greeks don't like Italians,\" Charley laughed,  as he ran aft to the tiller.    And never in my experience have I seen a man so anxious for the  capture of another as was our prisoner in the chase that followed. His  eyes fairly snapped, and his nostrils quivered and dilated in a most  extraordinary way. Charley steered while he tended the sheet; and  though Charley was as quick and alert as a cat, the Greek could  hardly control his impatience.    The Italians were cut off from the shore, which was fully a mile away  at its nearest point. Did they attempt to make it, we could haul after  them with the wind abeam, and overtake them before they had covered an  eighth of the distance. But they were too wise to attempt it,  contenting themselves with rowing lustily to windward along the  starboard side of a big ship, the _Lancashire Queen_. But beyond the  ship lay an open stretch of fully two miles to the shore in that  direction. This, also, they dared not attempt, for we were bound to  catch them before they could cover it. So, when they reached the bow  of the _Lancashire Queen_, nothing remained but to pass around and row  down her port side toward the stern, which meant rowing to leeward and  giving us the advantage.    We in the salmon boat, sailing close on the wind, tacked about and  crossed the ship's bow. Then Charley put up the tiller and headed down  the port side of the ship, the Greek letting out the sheet and  grinning with delight. The Italians were already half-way down the  ship's length; but the stiff breeze at our back drove us after them  far faster than they could row. Closer and closer we came, and I,  lying down forward, was just reaching out to grasp the skiff, when it  ducked under the great stern of the _Lancashire Queen_.    The chase was virtually where it had begun. The Italians were rowing  up the starboard side of the ship, and we were hauled close on the  wind and slowly edging out from the ship as we worked to windward.  Then they darted around her bow and began the row down her port side,  and we tacked about, crossed her bow, and went plunging down the wind  hot after them. And again, just as I was reaching for the skiff, it  ducked under the ship's stern and out of danger. And so it went,  around and around, the skiff each time just barely ducking into  safety.    By this time the ship's crew had become aware of what was taking  place, and we could see their heads in a long row as they looked at us  over the bulwarks. Each time we missed the skiff at the stern, they  set up a wild cheer and dashed across to the other side of the  _Lancashire Queen_ to see the chase to windward. They showered us and  the Italians with jokes and advice, and made our Greek so angry that  at least once on each circuit he raised his fist and shook it at them  in a rage. They came to look for this, and at each display greeted it  with uproarious mirth.    \"Wot a circus!\" cried one.    \"Tork about yer marine hippodromes,--if this ain't one, I'd like to  know!\" affirmed another.    \"Six-days-go-as-yer-please,\" announced a third. \"Who says the dagoes  won't win?\"    On the next tack to windward the Greek offered to change places with  Charley.    \"Let-a me sail-a de boat,\" he demanded. \"I fix-a them, I catch-a them,  sure.\"    This was a stroke at Charley's professional pride, for pride himself  he did upon his boat-sailing abilities; but he yielded the tiller to  the prisoner and took his place at the sheet. Three times again we  made the circuit, and the Greek found that he could get no more speed  out of the salmon boat than Charley had.    \"Better give it up,\" one of the sailors advised from above.    The Greek scowled ferociously and shook his fist in his customary  fashion. In the meanwhile my mind had not been idle, and I had finally  evolved an idea.    \"Keep going, Charley, one time more,\" I said.    And as we laid out on the next tack to windward, I bent a piece of  line to a small grappling hook I had seen lying in the bail-hole. The  end of the line I made fast to the ring-bolt in the bow, and with the  hook out of sight I waited for the next opportunity to use it. Once  more they made their leeward pull down the port side of the  _Lancashire Queen_, and more once we churned down after them before  the wind. Nearer and nearer we drew, and I was making believe to reach  for them as before. The stern of the skiff was not six feet away, and  they were laughing at me derisively as they ducked under the ship's  stern. At that instant I suddenly arose and threw the grappling iron.  It caught fairly and squarely on the rail of the skiff, which was  jerked backward out of safety as the rope tautened and the salmon boat  ploughed on.    A groan went up from the row of sailors above, which quickly changed  to a cheer as one of the Italians whipped out a long sheath-knife and  cut the rope. But we had drawn them out of safety, and Charley, from  his place in the stern-sheets, reached over and clutched the stern of  the skiff. The whole thing happened in a second of time, for the first  Italian was cutting the rope and Charley was clutching the skiff, when  the second Italian dealt him a rap over the head with an oar. Charley  released his hold and collapsed, stunned, into the bottom of the  salmon boat, and the Italians bent to their oars"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28696"],[0,"Symbolic Logic (#8)"],[1,"rich men\" is all the information we possess; and we may proceed      to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in      order to make up the entire Proposition \"_All_ bankers are rich      men\".]    Let us also suppose that the 'Univ.' (i.e. the Genus, of which both the  Subject and the Predicate are Specieses) has been divided (by the  Process of _Dichotomy_) into two smaller Classes, viz.        (1) the Predicate;        (2) the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of      the Predicate.        [Thus, we may suppose that the Genus \"men,\" (of which both      \"bankers\" and \"rich men\" are Specieses) has been divided into      the two smaller Classes, \"rich men\", \"poor men\".]                                                                     pg018  Now we know that _every_ Member of the Subject is (as shown at p. 6) a  Member of the Univ. Hence _every_ Member of the Subject is either in  Class (1) or else in Class (2).        [Thus, we know that _every_ banker is a Member of the Genus      \"men\". Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class \"rich men\",      or else in the Class \"poor men\".]    Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_  Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What _else_ do we need to be  told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need  to be told that _none_ of them are in Class (2); i.e. that _none_ of  them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to  that of the Predicate.        [Thus, we may suppose we have been told that _some_ bankers are      in the Class \"rich men\". What _else_ do we need to be told, in      order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to      be told that _none_ of them are in the Class \"_poor_ men\".]    Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", is a _Double_  Proposition, and is '=equivalent=' to (i.e. gives the same information  as) the _two_ Propositions        (1) \"_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the      Predicate\";        (2) \"_No_ Members of the Subject are Members of the      Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of      the Predicate\".        [Thus, the Proposition \"_All_ bankers are rich men\" is a      _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_      Propositions            (1) \"_Some_ bankers are rich men\";            (2) \"_No_ bankers are _poor_ men\".]                                                                       pg019  Sec. 4.    _What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its  Terms?_    Note that the rules, here laid down, are _arbitrary_, and only apply to  Part I of my \"Symbolic Logic.\"    A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"Some\", is henceforward to be  understood as asserting that there are _some existing Things_, which,  being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e.  that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. Hence  it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is  _Real_.        [Thus, the Proposition \"Some rich men are invalids\" is to be      understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are \"rich      invalids\". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes,      \"rich men\" and \"invalids\", taken by itself, is _Real_.]    A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"No\", is henceforward to be  understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being  Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _no  existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. But this implies  nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself.        [Thus, the Proposition \"No mermaids are milliners\" is to be      understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are      \"mermaid-milliners\". But this implies nothing as to the      _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes,      \"mermaids\" and \"milliners\", taken by itself. In this case as it      happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_.]    A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", contains (see Sec. 3) a  similar Proposition beginning with \"Some\". Hence it is to be understood  as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_.        [Thus, the Proposition \"All hyaenas are savage animals\" contains      the Proposition \"Some hyaenas are savage animals\". Hence it      implies that _each_ of the two Classes, \"hyaenas\" and \"savage      animals\", taken by itself, is _Real_.]                                                                       pg020  Sec. 5.    _Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions  of Existence._    We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"Some,\"  asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are  _also_ Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing  Things are Members of _both_; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things  are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of  the Subject and the Predicate.    Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take  \"existing Things\" as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the  Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate.    Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with \"No\".    A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", is (as shown in Sec. 3)  equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one beginning with \"Some\" and the  other with \"No\", each of which we now know how to translate.        [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.        (1)            \"Some apples are not ripe.\"        Here we arrange thus:--            \"Some\"                     _Sign of Quantity_.          \"existing Things\"          _Subject_.          \"are\"                      _Copula_.          \"not-ripe apples\"          _Predicate_.        or thus:--            \"Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples.\"                                                                     pg021      (2)            \"Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever          it may be.\"        Here we arrange thus:--            \"Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always          grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.\"        (3)            \"No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.\"        Here we arrange thus:--            \"No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to          smoke cigars.\"        (4)            \"None of my speculations have brought me as much          as 5 per cent.\"        Here we arrange thus:--            \"No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine,          which have brought me as much as 5 per cent.\"        (5)            \"None but the brave deserve the fair.\"        Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase \"none but the      brave\" is equivalent to \"no not-brave men.\" We then arrange      thus:--            \"No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving          of the fair.\"        (6)            \"All bankers are rich men.\"        This is equivalent to the two Propositions \"Some bankers are      rich men\" and \"No bankers are poor men.\"        Here we arrange thus:--            \"Some | existing Things | are | rich bankers\";              and          \"No | existing Things | are | poor bankers.\"]          [Work Examples Sec. =1=, 1-4 (p. 97).]                                                                       pg022      BOOK III.

CHAPTER I.    _SYMBOLS AND CELLS._      First, let us suppose that the above Diagram is an enclosure assigned to  a certain Class of Things, which we have selected as our 'Universe of  Discourse.' or, more briefly, as our 'Univ'.        [For example, we might say \"Let Univ. be 'books'\"; and we might      imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all      \"books.\"]        [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_      to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for      himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he      reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it,      about which he is reading.]                                                                     pg023  Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which  we may call \"x,\" and have divided the large Class, to which we have  assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose  Differentiae are \"x\" and \"not-x\" (which we may call \"x'\"), and that we  have assigned the _North_ Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may  call \"the Class of x-Things,\" or \"the x-Class\"), and the _South_ Half to  the other (which we may call \"the Class of x'-Things,\" or \"the  x'-Class\").        [For example, we might say \"Let x mean 'old,' so that x' will      mean 'new',\" and we might suppose that we had divided books into      the two Classes whose Differentiae are \"old\" and \"new,\" and had      assigned the _North_ Half of the table to \"_old_ books\" and the      _South_ Half to \"_new_ books.\"]    Thirdly, let us suppose that we have selected another Adjunct, which we  may call \"y\", and have subdivided the x-Class into the two Classes whose  Differentiae are \"y\" and \"y'\", and that we have assigned the North-_West_  Cell to the one (which we may call \"the xy-Class\"), and the North-_East_  Cell to the other (which we may call \"the xy'-Class\").        [For example, we might say \"Let y mean 'English,' so that y'      will mean 'foreign'\", and we might suppose that we had      subdivided \"old books\" into the two Classes whose Differentiae      are \"English\" and \"foreign\", and had assigned the North-_West_      Cell to \"old _English_ books\", and the North-_East_ Cell to \"old      _foreign_"]]]
