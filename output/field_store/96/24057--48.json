I sought news of her from the old hag, and from the  fried-fish seller. They both told me she had gone away to _Laloro_,  which is their name for Portugal. They probably said it by Carmen's  orders, but I soon found out they were lying. Some weeks after my day  in the _Calle del Candilejo_ I was on duty at one of the town gates. A  little way from the gate there was a breach in the wall. The masons were  working at it in the daytime, and at night a sentinel was posted on it,  to prevent smugglers from getting in. All through one day I saw Lillas  Pastia going backward and forward near the guard-room, and talking to  some of my comrades. They all knew him well, and his fried-fish and  fritters even better. He came up to me, and asked if I had any news of  Carmen.    \"'No,' said I.    \"'Well,' said he, 'you'll soon hear of her, old fellow.'    \"He was not mistaken. That night I was posted to guard the breach in  the wall. As soon as the sergeant had disappeared I saw a woman coming  toward me. My heart told me it was Carmen. Still I shouted:    \"'Keep off! Nobody can pass here!'    \"'Now, don't be spiteful,' she said, making herself known to me.    \"'What! you here, Carmen?'    \"'Yes, _mi payllo_. Let us say few words, but wise ones. Would you  like to earn a douro? Some people will be coming with bundles. Let them  alone.'    \"'No,' said I, 'I must not allow them through. These are my orders.'    \"'Orders! orders! You didn't think about orders in the _Calle del  Candilejo_!'    \"'Ah!' I cried, quite maddened by the very thought of that night. 'It  was well worth while to forget my orders for that! But I won't have any  smuggler's money!'    \"'Well, if you won't have money, shall we go and dine together at old  Dorotea's?'    \"'No,' said I, half choked by the effort it cost me. 'No, I can't.'    \"'Very good! If you make so many difficulties, I know to whom I can  go. I'll ask your officer if he'll come with me to Dorotea's. He looks  good-natured, and he'll post a sentry who'll only see what he had better  see. Good-bye, canary-bird! I shall have a good laugh the day the order  comes out to hang you!'    \"I was weak enough to call her back, and I promised to let the whole  of gipsydom pass in, if that were necessary, so that I secured the  only reward I longed for. She instantly swore she would keep her word  faithfully the very next day, and ran off to summon her friends, who  were close by. There were five of them, of whom Pastia was one, all well  loaded with English goods. Carmen kept watch for them. She was to warn  them with her castanets the instant she caught sight of the patrol. But  there was no necessity for that. The smugglers finished their job in a  moment.    \"The next day I went to the _Calle del Candilejo_. Carmen kept me  waiting, and when she came, she was in rather a bad temper.    \"'I don't like people who have to be pressed,' she said. 'You did me a  much greater service the first time, without knowing you'd gain anything  by it. Yesterday you bargained with me. I don't know why I've come, for  I don't care for you any more. Here, be off with you. Here's a douro for  your trouble.'    \"I very nearly threw the coin at her head, and I had to make a violent  effort to prevent myself from actually beating her. After we had  wrangled for an hour I went off in a fury. For some time I wandered  about the town, walking hither and thither like a madman. At last I went  into a church, and getting into the darkest corner I could find, I cried  hot tears. All at once I heard a voice.    \"'A dragoon in tears. I'll make a philter of them!'    \"I looked up. There was Carmen in front of me.    \"'Well, _mi payllo_, are you still angry with me?' she said. 'I must  care for you in spite of myself, for since you left me I don't know what  has been the matter with me. Look you, it is I who ask you to come to  the _Calle del Candilejo_, now!'    \"So we made it up: but Carmen's temper was like the weather in our  country. The storm is never so close, in our mountains, as when the sun  is at its brightest. She had promised to meet me again at Dorotea's, but  she didn't come.    \"And Dorotea began telling me again that she had gone off to Portugal  about some gipsy business.    \"As experience had already taught me how much of that I was to believe,  I went about looking for Carmen wherever I thought she might be, and  twenty times in every day I walked through the _Calle del Candilejo_.  One evening I was with Dorotea, whom I had almost tamed by giving her  a glass of anisette now and then, when Carmen walked in, followed by a  young man, a lieutenant in our regiment.    \"'Get away at once,' she said to me in Basque. I stood there,  dumfounded, my heart full of rage.    \"'What are you doing here?' said the lieutenant to me. 'Take yourself  off--get out of this.'    \"I couldn't move a step. I felt paralyzed. The officer grew angry, and  seeing I did not go out, and had not even taken off my forage cap, he  caught me by the collar and shook me roughly. I don't know what I said  to him. He drew his sword, and I unsheathed mine. The old woman caught  hold of my arm, and the lieutenant gave me a wound on the forehead, of  which I still bear the scar. I made a step backward, and with one jerk  of my elbow I threw old Dorotea down. Then, as the lieutenant still  pressed me, I turned the point of my sword against his body and he  ran upon it. Then Carmen put out the lamp and told Dorotea, in her own  language, to take to flight. I fled into the street myself, and began  running along, I knew not whither. It seemed to me that some one was  following me. When I came to myself I discovered that Carmen had never  left me.    \"'Great stupid of a canary-bird!' she said, 'you never make anything but  blunders. And, indeed, you know I told you I should bring you bad luck.  But come, there's a cure for everything when you have a Fleming from  Rome* for your love. Begin by rolling this handkerchief round your head,  and throw me over that belt of yours. Wait for me in this alley--I'll be  back in two minutes.         * _Flamenco de Roma_, a slang term for the gipsies. Roma       does not stand for the Eternal City, but for the nation of       the _romi_, or the married folk--a name applied by the       gipsies to themselves. The first gipsies seen in Spain       probably came from the Low Countries, hence their name of       _Flemings_.    \"She disappeared, and soon came back bringing me a striped cloak which  she had gone to fetch, I knew not whence. She made me take off my  uniform, and put on the cloak over my shirt. Thus dressed, and with the  wound on my head bound round with the handkerchief, I was tolerably like  a Valencian peasant, many of whom come to Seville to sell a drink they  make out of '_chufas_.'* Then she took me to a house very much like  Dorotea's, at the bottom of a little lane. Here she and another gipsy  woman washed and dressed my wounds, better than any army surgeon could  have done, gave me something, I know not what, to drink, and finally  made me lie down on a mattress, on which I went to sleep.         * A bulbous root, out of which rather a pleasant beverage is       manufactured.    \"Probably the woman had mixed one of the soporific drugs of which they  know the secret in my drink, for I did not wake up till very late the  next day. I was rather feverish, and had a violent headache. It was some  time before the memory of the terrible scene in which I had taken part  on the previous night came back to me. After having dressed my wound,  Carmen and her friend, squatting on their heels beside my mattress,  exchanged a few words of '_chipe calli_,' which appeared to me to be  something in the nature of a medical consultation. Then they both of  them assured me that I should soon be cured, but that I must get out  of Seville at the earliest possible moment, for that, if I was caught  there, I should most undoubtedly be shot.    \"'My boy,' said Carmen to me, 'you'll have to do something. Now that  the king won't give you either rice or haddock* you'll have to think of  earning your livelihood. You're too stupid for stealing _a pastesas_.**  But you are brave and active. If you have the pluck, take yourself off  to the coast and turn smuggler. Haven't I promised to get you hanged?  That's better than being shot, and besides, if you set about it  properly, you'll live like a prince as long as the _minons_*** and the  coast-guard don't lay their hands on your collar.'         * The ordinary food of a Spanish soldier.         ** _Ustilar a pastesas_, to steal cleverly, to purloin       without violence.         *** A sort of volunteer corps.    \"In this attractive guise did this fiend of a girl describe the new  career she was suggesting to me,--the only one, indeed, remaining, now  I had incurred the penalty of death. Shall I confess it, sir? She  persuaded me without much difficulty. This wild and dangerous life, it  seemed to me, would bind her and me more closely together. In future, I  thought, I should be able to make sure of her love.    \"I had often heard talk of certain smugglers who travelled about  Andalusia, each riding a good horse, with his mistress behind him and  his blunderbuss in his fist. Already I saw myself trotting up and down  the world, with a pretty gipsy behind me. When I mentioned that notion  to her, she laughed till she had to hold her sides, and vowed there was  nothing in the world so delightful as a night spent camping in the open  air, when each _rom_ retired with his _romi_ beneath their little tent,  made of three hoops with a blanket thrown across them.    \"'If I take to the mountains,' said I to her, 'I shall be sure of you.  There'll be no lieutenant there to go shares with me.'    \"'Ha! ha! you're jealous!' she retorted, 'so much the worse for you.

Now the Marsala was very good  and, according to Vanni, could be put upon the market at a very low  price, but I foresaw difficulties.  Knowing that he had sung in opera in  Naples, Palermo, Malta and many other places, I asked if he liked music.  He said he adored it.  Music, he declared, was the most precious gift of  God to man--more precious even than poetry.  He had his box at the opera  and always occupied it during the season.  And he enjoyed music of all  kinds, not only the modern operas of Mascagni, Puccini and so on, but  also the old music of Verdi, Donizetti and Bellini.  I asked if he did  not like _Le Nozze di Figaro_.  He had never heard of it, nor of _Don  Giovanni_, nor of _Fidelio_.  He had heard the names of Beethoven and  Mozart, but not of Handel, Schubert or Brahms.  He had heard also of  Wagner, but had never heard any of his music.    I was not surprised he should not have heard of those composers who are  not famous for operas, nor by his odd list of so-called old musicians,  but I was surprised that he should place music so decidedly above poetry.  I said it appeared to me he had practically expressed the opinion that  Donizetti was a more precious gift of God to man than Dante.  Put like  that, he did not hold to what he had said and confessed he had been  speaking without due consideration.  But Peppino said that in some  respects Donizetti was a better man than Dante; he was smoother and  better tempered, \"and many things like this.\"  Peppino had been brought  up, like every Italian, to worship Dante, but when he went to London and  mastered the English language, when he began to read our literature and  to think for himself, then he saw that Dante was \"un falso idolo.\"  Every  nation gets the poet she deserves and Italy has her faults; but what,  asked Peppino, what has Italy done to deserve her dreary Dante?  On the  other hand, with all his admiration for England, he could hardly believe  that we really do deserve our Shakespeare.    I was beginning to feel giddy, as though the _Sorella di Ninu_, instead  of being quietly in port, was out on the tumbling ocean in a sudden gale,  so very unusual is it to hear such opinions in Italy.  But Peppino is  full of surprises.  To recover my balance I turned the conversation back  to the wine, taking my way through the music and telling them that in  England we thought very highly of the Austrian and German composers, and  asking Vanni if he would recommend any one to introduce their  compositions into Sicily.  He replied that if it was pleasing music it  might be successful, but that if it was very different from Italian music  it would hardly pay to bring it over until the people had been educated.  I feared it would be the same with the wine.  He must first educate us to  forsake our old friends, beer, whisky and tea, before he could create a  market on which he could put his Marsala.    Driving back, I told Peppino about the lottery at Castelvetrano and how  my numbers had lost.  He inquired whether my birthday fell during the  week I bought the ticket.  It did not.    \"Then,\" said he, \"of course you could not be winning and Angelo very  stupid to let you play those numbers.\"    It seems that numbers are no good unless they are connected with  something that happens to you during the week.  This explained why at  Selinunte the brigadier had discarded the price of my clothes, which was  not his concern but mine and belonged to the week in which I had bought  them, and preferred to play the number that fell from the cigarettes, of  which he was at the moment actually smoking one.    \"If there shall be a railway accident,\" continued Peppino, \"on Thursday  night, then shall there be going plenty much people and shall sleep in  the ground to be first on Friday morning, because the office shall shut  early to take the papers to Palermo to turn the wheel the Saturday.  And  if to come out the number, the people shall be gaining many money, but if  to don't come out, shall be gaining no money.  This is not a good thing.    \"They think it is fortunate the--please, what is sogno?  Excuse me, it is  the dream.  But it must be the dream in the week you play.  When the man  in the dream shall be coming from the other world and shall be saying,  'Please you, play this number,' then they believe you shall certainly  win.  But if to play the number, very uncertain to win.\"    They live in a state of wild hope after buying their tickets until the  numbers are declared and, the odds being enormously in favour of the  government, the gamblers usually lose.  Then they live in a state of  miserable despair until the possession of a few soldi, the happening of  something remarkable, or merely the recollection of the departed joys of  hope compared with present actual depression, urges them to try their  luck again.  So that the gambler's life consists of alternations of  feverish expectation and maddening dejection.  \"This is not a good  thing\"; but it is a worse thing for the gambler who wins.  He sees how  easy it is and is encouraged to believe he can do it every time; in his  exaltation he stakes again and loses all his winnings, instead of only a  few soldi.  If he does not do this he spends the money in treating his  friends and getting into debt over it and has to pawn his watch.  So that  the Genovese, by way of wishing his enemy ill-luck, while appearing to  observe the proprieties, says to him--    \"Ti auguro un' ambo.\"  (\"I hope you may win an ambo.\")    Peppino does not approve of the lottery, yet he has not made up his mind  that it ought to be abolished.  It certainly does harm, but so deep is  the natural instinct for gambling that innumerable private lotteries  would spring up to replace it, and they would do far more mischief,  because they would be in the hands of rogues, whereas the government  manages the affair quite honestly.  The government pays no attention to  dreams or ladies in white dresses or anything that happens during the  week; it bases its calculations on the mathematical theory of chances,  and gathers in the soldi week after week, so that it makes an annual  profit of about three million sterling.  Besides, if people are willing  to pay for the pleasure of a week of hope, why should they not be allowed  to do so?  The uneducated as a class ought to contribute to the expenses  of governing their country, and the lottery is a sure and convenient way  of collecting their contributions.  It is literally what it is often  called--La tassa sull' ignoranza.  (The tax upon ignorance.)    Peppino even uses the lottery himself, but in a way of his own.  He  chooses two numbers every week, according to what occurs to him as though  he were going in for an ambo and, instead of buying a ticket, puts four  soldi into an earthenware money-box.  The numbers he has chosen do not  come out and he considers that he has won his four soldi and has put them  by.  In this way he has accumulated several money-boxes full, and if ever  his numbers come out he intends to break his boxes and distribute the  contents among the deserving poor.    As a way of making money Peppino prefers the course of always doing  whatever there is to be done in the house and in the vineyard.  A few  years ago his father's vines were suffering from disease; he made  inquiries, studied the subject, ascertained the best course to pursue  and, with his own hands and some little assistance, rooted up all the  plants and laid down American vines, with the result that the yield is  now more than double what it ever was before.  And this he thinks was a  great deal better than losing money week after week in the lottery, not  only because of the result, but because of the interest he took in the  work.  In fact, he attends to his own business and finds every moment of  the day occupied.  He says--    \"Always to begin one thing before to finish some other thing, this is the  good life.\"    Certainly it seems to agree with him.  There is not much the matter with  Peppino's health nor with his banking account nor with his conscience, so  far as I can judge.  Every one in the town is fond of him and he is  always happy and ready to do any one a good turn.  Indeed, his popularity  is the only thing that causes me any uneasiness about him.  There is  generally something wrong about a man who has no enemies--but there are  exceptions to every rule.    The poor professor, on the other hand, has at least one enemy and that  the worst a man can have, namely himself.  The evening before he went  away he took me into his confidence and consulted me about his future and  his prospects.  He is married, but his wife is out of her mind, and he  has three sons, all doing badly, one of them very badly.  He told me he  was not at the moment employed as professor, he was living on his  patrimony which consisted of a few acres of vines; he was gradually  selling his land and spending the proceeds, and he thought this the best  plan because the vines were all diseased and did not bring him in enough  money to keep himself and his family.  Should I recommend him to come to  England, learn English and try to keep himself by the exercise of his  profession?  It was like Vanni's idea of bringing his wine to England.  I  could only say I was afraid we already had enough professors.  Then he  thought he might write and earn a little money that way; he had read all  Sir Walter Scott's novels in a translation--thirty-two volumes I think he  said; he admired them immensely and was thinking of writing a romance; he  had in fact an idea for one, and would I be so good as to give him my  opinion about it?  A young lady is desired by her father to marry a man  she does not love, a rich man, much older than herself.  She refuses,  but, later on, consents to make the sacrifice.  After a year of unhappy  married life she meets a man of her own age, falls in love with him, and  one day her husband"]]]
