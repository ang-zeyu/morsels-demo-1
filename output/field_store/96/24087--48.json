No good to me, boys.  I'm here for killin', not for road  punchin'.  I've got a head like a barrel and feet like boiled tomatoes.\"    \"Ye shouldna' drink beer,\" piped Sandy.    \"Wot should I drink then?\"    \"Proosic acid,\" Doolan muttered, giving Claud a nudge.    \"You've got a bad liver to-day, Bill.  I think you've been drinking the  Gippies' firewater.  I thought the old parson had got you to sign the  pledge.\"    \"Who could sign the pledge in an 'ole like this?  It's sand and flies,  flies and sand, C.B., bully beef, jam, and No. 9 pills.  Wot a life!\"  concluded Bill, relapsing into silence.  They left him alone.  It was  Bill's \"off day.\"  He would come round again.    Bill's attitude at that period of the war represented the feelings of  many a Tommy in the Australian and New Zealand forces.  These men,  accustomed to the life of freedom, action, and the daily use of  initiative, cursed the seemingly endless days of drill, shooting,  marching, manoeuvring, with the firm discipline and immediate  punishment when rules were ignored.  Eight long months of this was  their lot, and during that time there seemed little prospect of their  seeing war.  It was a hard test.    To them it seemed a cruel test.  The younger and more inexperienced  thought it useless and a waste of time, but the officers understood the  reason why.  It was Kitchener's way.  \"K\" knew that these men were the  finest fighters in the world.  But to get the fullest value for their  courage he realised that training and discipline, discipline,  discipline was absolutely essential.  Every officer of the General  Staff expected them to curse and kick.  The Staff also assumed that, in  the end, the Australians' true sense of justice would compel them to  admit that all this \"suffering\" would make them infinitely superior to  any Australian units which had hitherto shared in fighting for the  Motherland.  This is exactly what did occur.  Kitchener was, therefore,  right!  Kitchener is always right.          *      *      *      *      *    The Australian column had reached its rendezvous.  While the men were  resting, General Fearless, the Australian G.O.C., was issuing his  orders to the Brigade Commanders.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"the General Idea is that the Red Force, composed  of the Lancashire Division, holds the ridge of sand hills which  dominate the road to Cairo.  We, who represent the Blue Force, have  orders to make a reconnaissance in force.  That means that we must so  manoeuvre our units as to draw the enemy's fire, and, if possible,  reveal his position, his strength, and the weakest point in his line.  This, let me tell you, is not exactly an offensive movement.  It is a  drawing game.  That must be distinctly understood.  Of course, in such  a reconnaissance, if a G.O.C. saw something which _would_ justify his  assuming a vigorous offensive, then the game might develop into a  general action.  That, however, is a matter for me, not for an  individual brigadier.  Now, to-day, I want the Bushmen's Brigade to  cover our advance, the remaining brigades will act as in my operation  orders.  Remember, too, gentlemen, that units must keep up  communication.  Don't let the show develop into a sort of Donnybrook,  where each little unit is fighting for its own band.  That is all--fall  out, please.\"    The Brigadiers saluted, and returned to their units.  The scheme was  again explained.  Ten minutes afterwards the brigades moved into  position.  The Bushmen's Brigade took post away in front; in the centre  of this front line was the Kangaroo Marines.  Covering the whole  advance was a screen of men, and in front of the screen, little patrols  with scouts ahead.  When all were in the position the G.O.C. signalled  \"Advance.\"  An army on the move is a fascinating sight.  It is like an  octopus--the main body with a thousand tendrils, or arms, thrown out.  These recoil as they touch the enemy, telling the brain that danger is  near.    In selecting the Bushmen's Brigade for the advanced guard, the G.O.C.  was right.  They were born scouts, especially the Kangaroo Marines.  These valiants wriggled, crawled, and occasionally doubled across the  burning sands.  It was hard work--mighty hard work--but they didn't  mind.  They were doing something useful, and as long as a Bushman is  doing that he is all alive and interested.    Bang! went a rifle ahead of them.  Bang!  Bang!  Bang! went the reply.  The fight had commenced.  Bill, who was in command of Doolan and Sandy,  was right ahead.  Claud was away on his right with another little  squad.  But it was Bill's keen eyes which had first seen little groups  of the enemy ahead.  One little group, grown tired of waiting, was  snoozing peacefully on a sandy hollow.  Bill and his cronies crept on  their stomachs towards them.  Nearer they drew, then, with a yell,  leaped down on them.    \"Hands up, boys; we've got you.\"    \"Who are ye kiddin'?\" said a Lancashire lad, jumping up with his pals.    \"There's no kiddin' about this business,\" said Bill.  \"Chuck them  rifles over here.\"    \"All right, lad; thou can 'ave 'em--give us a fag,\" said the leader,  glad to be out of the hurly-burly.    They were sent to the rear.    Meantime, the firing had become stronger.  Away ahead, Bill's party saw  a long line of men lying about on a ridge of sand.  They were firing  furiously at the advancing scouts.    \"I reckon that's a patrol.  We'd better scatter them,\" ordered Bill,  going forward in the most brazen manner to capture about twenty men.  According to the rules of war this was impossible.  Hence the sudden  appearance of a \"Brass Hat\" with a white band on his arm.    \"Here--you!\" he shouted to Bill and his men.    \"Well, matey--what's wrong?\"    \"You're out of action--clear out,\" said the officer, a little annoyed  at the term \"matey.\"    \"Hands up,\" said Bill, shoving in a round of blank and presenting his  rifle at the man on the horse.    \"Confound your cheek--how dare you----\"    \"No lip, old cock.  Get off that gee-gee.\"    \"Don't you know who I am?  I'm Colonel Redtabs----\"    \"And I'm Bill Buster, boss of this scoutin' show.  You can't fool  me--I'm an Australian.\"    \"Hang it all!  Don't you know I'm an umpire?\"    \"Look here, this ain't a cricket match.  Get off, or I'll blow you  off,\" said Bill, fingering his trigger.  The old colonel, realising  that he was dealing with a too zealous scout, unacquainted with the  rules of mimic warfare, jumped off his horse.    \"Now, Sandy, get on that horse.\"    \"What?\" said Sandy, a little confused.    \"Get on that horse or I'll blow you _on_,\" ordered Bill, somewhat  annoyed at the waste of time.    Sandy jumped up.    \"Now, take this bloke back to Colonel Killem.  Tell him he's a poor  fellow wot's wrong in his head, an' thinks he's at a cricket match.\"    The captured umpire, who was a sportsman with a real sense of humour,  laughed heartily as he was led away.    \"Knew he was mad,\" commented Bill, as he watched him go.  \"Now, Paddy,  that patrol has scooted; let's get after them.\"    The attack was now well into the first stage.  The scouts of the  Lancashires were fighting a running action with the scouts and patrols  of the Australians.  From knoll to knoll they were pressed, both sides  skilfully using every fold in the ground.  Bill, by this time, had  increased his army to about twenty men.  Using the most original  adjectives and assuming a superior air, he ordered his command about  like some old fire-eating colonel.  His vigorous pursuit kept the enemy  busy, but eventually they pulled him up in front of a roughly-made  sangar.  This was a strong detached post thrown out in front of the  outpost line.  The defenders gave his little army a fierce fusillade of  blank.    \"That's up _you_, Buffalo Bill,\" said the mischievous Doolan.    \"Silence in the ranks,\" roared Bill, who was taking himself very  seriously.  He carefully surveyed the position, which held fifty men.  They were not to be moved, that was evident.  Bill determined to do so.    \"Fix bayonets!\" he shouted.    \"Ain't allowed,\" said a stripling at his side.    \"Fix bayonets!\" he ordered again.    \"I tell you it ain't allowed at these sham shows.  Colonel's orders.\"    \"Look 'ere, you take Bill Buster's orders, or you'll get a thick ear.\"  That settled the matter.    \"Charge!\" roared the leader, jumping up and leading the twenty  full-blooded desperadoes up to the redoubt.    \"Halt, you fellows!  Halt!\" roared a Lancashire subaltern, jumping up.  \"Are you off your bally heads?\"    \"'Ere, mate, you're supposed to be dead,\" said Bill, panting and  blowing, but holding a bayonet at his chest.  The remainder of his  party were, meantime, tickling the fast retreating Lancashire lads with  the points of their bayonets.    \"Don't you know who I am?\" said the indignant subaltern.    \"Look 'ere, young fellow, you're supposed to be dead.\"    \"How dare you--I'm an officer!\"    \"I'm Bill Buster.  Now will you lie down an' kid you're dead.  That's  wot you've got to do at these shows.\"    \"Don't be a bally ass!\"    \"All right, cocky; hand me that sword.\"    As Bill's bayonet looked rather unpleasant, the officer complied.  Then  Bill sat down.  Pulling a black stump of a pencil out of his pocket, he  proceed to write a dispatch.  It was as follows:      \"DEAR CURNEL,--Paddy Doolan an' I, with twenty boys, just captured  enemy's position.  Enemy running like blazes.  The officer bloke  refuses to be dead.  I'm sending him to you.  We're just goin' off to  try an' capture a general.--Yours,    \"BILL BUSTER.\"    \"P.S.--Did you get that mad fellow wot thinks we're playin' cricket?  Pore chap!\"      This letter and the prisoner were dispatched under escort to Colonel  Killem in rear.  Bill again proceeded to join the long line of scouts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#8)"],[1,"iend. \"They ain't  none over here. What kind of bugs?\"    \"Sufferin' Moses, I ain't no bugologist! All kinds!\"    But Hopalong got it at last. He had found tobacco and rolled a  cigarette, and in reaching for a match exposed his shoulder to a shot  that broke his collar bone. Skinny's rifle cracked in reply and the  offending brave rolled out from behind a rock. From the fuss emanating  from Hopalong's direction Skinny knew that his neighbor had been hit.    \"Don't yu care, Hoppy. I got th' cuss,\" he said consolingly. \"Where'd he  git yu?\" he asked.    \"In di' heart, yu pie-faced nuisance. Come over here an' corral this  cussed bandage an' gimme some water,\" snapped the injured man.    Skinny wormed his way through the thorny chaparral and bound up the  shoulder. \"Anything else?\" he asked.    \"Yes. Shoot that bunch of warts an' blow that tobacco-eyed Gila to  Cheyenne. This here's worse than the time we cleaned out th' C 80  outfit!\" Then he kicked the dead toad and swore at the sun.    \"Close yore yap; yore worse than a kid! Anybody'd think yu never got  plugged afore,\" said Skinny indignantly.    \"I can cuss all I wants,\" replied Hopalong, proving his assertion as he  grabbed his gun and fired at the dead Indian. A bullet whined above  his head and Skinny fired at the smoke. He peeped out and saw that his  friends were getting nearer to the knoll.    \"They's closin' in now. We'll soon be gittin' home,\" he reported.    Hopalong looked out in time to see Buck make a dash for a bowlder that  lay ten yards in front of him, which he reached in safety. Lanky also  ran in and Pete added five more yards to his advance. Buck made  another dash, but leaped into the air, and, coming down as if from an  intentional high jump, staggered and stumbled for a few paces and then  fell flat, rolling over and over toward the shelter of a split rock,  where he lay quiet. A leering red face peered over the rocks on the  knoll, but the whoop of exultation was cut short, for Red's rifle  cracked and the warrior rolled down the steep bank, where another shot  from the same gun settled him beyond question.    Hopalong choked and, turning his face away, angrily dashed his knuckles  into his eyes. \"Blast 'em! Blast 'em! They've got Buck! They've got  Buck, blast 'em! They've got Buck, Skinny! Good old Buck! They've got  him! Jimmy's gone, Johnny's plugged, and now Buck's gone! Come on!\"  he sobbed in a frenzy of vengeance. \"Come on, Skinny! We'll tear their  cussed hides into a deeper red than they are now! Oh, blast it, I can't  see--where's my gun?\" He groped for the rifle and fought Skinny when the  latter, red-eyed but cool, endeavored to restrain him. \"Lemme go, curse  yu! Don't yu know they got Buck? Lemme go!\"    \"Down! Red's got di' skunk. Yu can't do nothin'--they'd drop yu afore  yu took five steps. Red's got him, I tell yu! Do yu want me to lick yu?  We'll pay 'em back with interest if yu'll keep yore head!\" exclaimed  Skinny, throwing the crazed man heavily.    Musical tones, rising and falling in weird octaves, whining pityingly,  diabolically, sobbing in a fascinating monotone and slobbering in  ragged chords, calling as they swept over the plain, always calling and  exhorting, they mingled in barbaric discord with the defiant barks of  the six-shooters and the inquiring cracks of the Winchesters. High up in  the air several specks sailed and drifted, more coming up rapidly from  all directions. Buzzards know well where food can be found.    As Hopalong leaned back against a rock he was hit in the thigh by a  ricochet that tore its way out, whirling like a circular saw, a span  above where it entered. The wound was very nasty, being ripped twice  the size made by an ordinary shot, and it bled profusely. Skinny crawled  over and attended to it, making a tourniquet of his neckerchief and  clumsily bandaging it with a strip torn from his shirt.    \"Yore shore lucky, yu are,\" he grumbled as he made his way back to his  post, where he vented his rancor by emptying the semi-depleted magazine  of his Winchester at the knoll.    Hopalong began to sing and shout and he talked of Jimmy and his  childhood, interspersing the broken narrative with choice selections  as sung in the music halls of Leavenworth and Abilene. He wound up by  yelling and struggling, and Skinny had his hands full in holding him.    \"Hopalong! Cassidy! Come out of that! Keep quiet--yu'll shore git plugged  if yu don't stop that plungin'. For gosh sake, did yu hear that?\" A  bullet viciously hissed between them and flattened out on a near-by  rock; others cut their way through the chaparral to the sound of falling  twigs, and Skinny threw himself on the struggling man and strapped  Hopalong with his belt to the base of a honey mesquite that grew at his  side.    \"Hold still, now, and let that bandage alone. Yu allus goes off di'  range when yu gets plugged,\" he complained. He cut down a cactus and  poured the sap over the wounded man's face, causing him to gurgle and  look around. His eyes had a sane look now and Skinny slid off his chest.    \"Git that--belt loose; I ain't--no cow,\" brokenly blazed out the picketed  Hopalong. Skinny did so, handed the irate man his Colts and returned to  his own post, from where he fired twice, reporting the shots.    \"I'm tryin' to get him on th' glance' first one went high an' th' other  fell flat,\" he explained.    Hopalong listened eagerly, for this was shooting that he could  appreciate. \"Lemme see,\" he commanded. Skinny dragged him over to a  crack and settled down for another try.    \"Where is he, Skinny?\" Asked Hopalong.    \"Behind that second big one. No, over on this here side. See that smooth  granite? If I can get her there on th' right spot he'll shore know it.\"  He aimed carefully and fired.    Through Pete's glasses Hopalong saw a leaden splotch appear on the rock  and he notified the marksman that he was shooting high. \"Put her on that  bump closer down,\" he suggested. Skinny did so and another yell reached  their ears.    \"That's a dandy. Yore shore all right, yu old cuss,\" complimented  Hopalong, elated at the success of the experiment.    Skinny fired again and a brown arm flopped out into sight. Another shot  struck it and it jerked as though it were lifeless.    \"He's cashed. See how she jumped? Like a rope,\" remarked Skinny with a  grin. The arm lay quiet.    Pete had gained his last cover and was all eyes and Colts. Lanky was  also very close in and was intently watching one particular rock.  Several shots echoed from the far side of the knoll and they knew that  Red was all right. Billy was covering a cluster of rocks that protruded  above the others and, as they looked, his rifle rang out and the last  defender leaped down and disappeared in the chaparral. He wore yellow  trousers and an old boiled shirt.    \"By an'-by, by all that's bad!\" yelled Hopalong. \"Th' measly coyote! An'  me a-fillin' his ornery hide with liquor. Well, they'll have to find  him all over again now,\" he complained, astounded by the revelation. He  fired into the chaparral to express his pugnacious disgust and scared  out a huge tarantula, which alighted on Skinny's chaps, crawling rapidly  toward the unconscious man's neck. Hopalong's face hardened and he  slowly covered the insect and fired, driving it into the sand, torn  and lifeless. The bullet touched the leathern garment and Skinny  remonstrated, knowing that Hopalong was in no condition for fancy  shooting.    \"Huh!\" exclaimed Hopalong. \"That was a tarantula what I plugged. He  was headin' for yore neck,\" he explained, watching the chaparral with  apprehension.    \"Go 'way, was it? Bully for yu!\" exclaimed Skinny, tarantulas being  placed at par with rattlesnakes, and he considered that he had been  saved from a horrible death. \"Thought yu said they wasn't no bugs over  here,\" he added in an aggrieved tone.    \"They wasn't none. Yu brought 'em. I only had th' main show--Gilas,  rattlers an' toads,\" he replied, and then added, \"Ain't it cussed hot up  here?\"    \"She is. Yu won't have no cinch ridin' home with that leg. Yu better  take my cayuse--he's busted more'n yourn,\" responded Skinny.    \"Yore cayuse is at th' Cross Bar O, yu wall-eyed pirute.\"    \"Shore 'nuff. Funny how a feller forgets sometimes. Lemme alone now,  they's goin' to git By-an'-by. Pete an' Lanky has just went in after  him.\"    That was what had occurred. The two impatient punchers, had grown tired  of waiting, and risked what might easily have been death in order to  hasten matters. The others kept up a rapid fire, directed at the far end  of the chaparral on the knoll, in order to mask the movements of their  venturesome friends, intending also to drive By-and-by toward them so  that he would be the one to get picked off as he advanced.    Several shots rang out in quick succession on the knoll and the  chaparral became agitated. Several more shots sounded from the depth  of the thicket and a mounted Indian dashed out of the northern edge and  headed in Buck's direction. His course would take him close to Buck,  whom he had seen fall, and would let him escape at a point midway  between Red and Skinny, as Lanky was on the knoll and the range was very  far to allow effective shooting by these two.    Red saw him leave the chaparral and in his haste to reload jammed the  cartridge, and By-and-by swept on toward temporary safety, with Red  dancing in a paroxysm of rage, swelling his vocabulary with words he had  forgotten existed.    By-and-by, rising to his full height in the saddle, turned and wiggled  his fingers at the frenzied Red and made several other signs that the  cowboy was in the humor to appreciate to the fullest extent. Then he  turned and shook his rifle at the marksmen on the larger knoll, whose  best shots kicked up the dust fully fifty yards too short. The pony was  sweeping toward the reservation and friends only fifteen miles away,  and By-and-by knew that once among the mountains he "]]]
