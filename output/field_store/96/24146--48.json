Franz wanted perseverance, Tommy steadiness, Ned went in for good  temper, Daisy for industry, Demi for \"as much wiseness as Grandpa,\" and  Nat timidly said he wanted so many things he would let Mr. Bhaer choose  for him. The others chose much the same things, and patience, good  temper, and generosity seemed the favorite crops. One boy wished to like  to get up early, but did not know what name to give that sort of seed;  and poor Stuffy sighed out,    \"I wish I loved my lessons as much as I do my dinner, but I can't.\"    \"We will plant self-denial, and hoe it and water it, and make it grow so  well that next Christmas no one will get ill by eating too much dinner.  If you exercise your mind, George, it will get hungry just as your body  does, and you will love books almost as much as my philosopher here,\"  said Mr. Bhaer; adding, as he stroked the hair off Demi's fine forehead,  \"You are greedy also, my son, and you like to stuff your little mind  full of fairy tales and fancies, as well as George likes to fill his  little stomach with cake and candy. Both are bad, and I want you to  try something better. Arithmetic is not half so pleasant as 'Arabian  Nights,' I know, but it is a very useful thing, and now is the time to  learn it, else you will be ashamed and sorry by and by.\"    \"But, 'Harry and Lucy,' and 'Frank,' are not fairy books, and they  are all full of barometers, and bricks, and shoeing horses, and useful  things, and I'm fond of them; ain't I, Daisy?\" said Demi, anxious to  defend himself.    \"So they are; but I find you reading 'Roland and Maybird,' a great deal  oftener than 'Harry and Lucy,' and I think you are not half so fond of  'Frank' as you are of 'Sinbad.' Come, I shall make a little bargain with  you both, George shall eat but three times a day, and you shall read but  one story-book a week, and I will give you the new cricket-ground; only,  you must promise to play in it,\" said Uncle Fritz, in his persuasive  way, for Stuffy hated to run about, and Demi was always reading in play  hours.    \"But we don't like cricket,\" said Demi.    \"Perhaps not now, but you will when you know it. Besides, you do like to  be generous, and the other boys want to play, and you can give them the  new ground if you choose.\"    This was taken them both on the right side, and they agreed to the  bargain, to the great satisfaction of the rest.    There was a little more talk about the gardens, and then they all sang  together. The band delighted Nat, for Mrs. Bhaer played the piano, Franz  the flute, Mr. Bhaer a bass viol, and he himself the violin. A very  simple little concert, but all seemed to enjoy it, and old Asia, sitting  in the corner, joined at times with the sweetest voice of any, for in  this family, master and servant, old and young, black and white, shared  in the Sunday song, which went up to the Father of them all. After this  they each shook hands with Father Bhaer; Mother Bhaer kissed them every  one from sixteen-year-old Franz to little Rob, how kept the tip of her  nose for his own particular kisses, and then they trooped up to bed.    The light of the shaded lamp that burned in the nursery shone softly on  a picture hanging at the foot of Nat's bed. There were several others  on the walls, but the boy thought there must be something peculiar about  this one, for it had a graceful frame of moss and cones about it, and  on a little bracket underneath stood a vase of wild flowers freshly  gathered from the spring woods. It was the most beautiful picture of  them all, and Nat lay looking at it, dimly feeling what it meant, and  wishing he knew all about it.    \"That's my picture,\" said a little voice in the room. Nat popped up his  head, and there was Demi in his night-gown pausing on his way back from  Aunt Jo's chamber, whither he had gone to get a cot for a cut finger.    \"What is he doing to the children?\" asked Nat.    \"That is Christ, the Good Man, and He is blessing the children. Don't  you know about Him?\" said Demi, wondering.    \"Not much, but I'd like to, He looks so kind,\" answered Nat, whose chief  knowledge of the Good Man consisted in hearing His name taken in vain.    \"I know all about it, and I like it very much, because it is true,\" said  Demi.    \"Who told you?\"    \"My Grandpa, he knows every thing, and tells the best stories in  the world. I used to play with his big books, and make bridges, and  railroads, and houses, when I was a little boy,\" began Demi.    \"How old are you now?\" asked Nat, respectfully.    \"'Most ten.\"    \"You know a lot of things, don't you?\"    \"Yes; you see my head is pretty big, and Grandpa says it will take a  good deal to fill it, so I keep putting pieces of wisdom into it as fast  as I can,\" returned Demi, in his quaint way.    Nat laughed, and then said soberly,    \"Tell on, please.\"    And Demi gladly told on without pause or punctuation. \"I found a very  pretty book one day and wanted to play with it, but Grandpa said I  mustn't, and showed me the pictures, and told me about them, and I liked  the stories very much, all about Joseph and his bad brothers, and the  frogs that came up out of the sea, and dear little Moses in the water,  and ever so many more lovely ones, but I liked about the Good Man best  of all, and Grandpa told it to me so many times that I learned it by  heart, and he gave me this picture so I shouldn't forget, and it was  put up here once when I was sick, and I left it for other sick boys to  see.\"'    \"What makes Him bless the children?\" asked Nat, who found something very  attractive in the chief figure of the group.    \"Because He loved them.\"    \"Were they poor children?\" asked Nat, wistfully.    \"Yes, I think so; you see some haven't got hardly any clothes on, and  the mothers don't look like rich ladies. He liked poor people, and was  very good to them. He made them well, and helped them, and told rich  people they must not be cross to them, and they loved Him dearly,  dearly,\" cried Demi, with enthusiasm.    \"Was He rich?\"    \"Oh no! He was born in a barn, and was so poor He hadn't any house to  live in when He grew up, and nothing to eat sometimes, but what people  gave Him, and He went round preaching to everybody, and trying to make  them good, till the bad men killed Him.\"    \"What for?\" and Nat sat up in his bed to look and listen, so interested  was he in this man who cared for the poor so much.    \"I'll tell you all about it; Aunt Jo won't mind;\" and Demi settled  himself on the opposite bed, glad to tell his favorite story to so good  a listener.    Nursey peeped in to see if Nat was asleep, but when she saw what was  going on, she slipped away again, and went to Mrs. Bhaer, saying with  her kind face full of motherly emotion,    \"Will the dear lady come and see a pretty sight? It's Nat listening  with all his heart to Demi telling the story of the Christ-child, like a  little white angel as he is.\"    Mrs. Bhaer had meant to go and talk with Nat a moment before he slept,  for she had found that a serious word spoken at this time often did  much good. But when she stole to the nursery door, and saw Nat eagerly  drinking in the words of his little friends, while Demi told the sweet  and solemn story as it had been taught him, speaking softly as he sat  with his beautiful eyes fixed on the tender face above them, her own  filled with tears, and she went silently away, thinking to herself,    \"Demi is unconsciously helping the poor boy better than I can; I will  not spoil it by a single word.\"    The murmur of the childish voice went on for a long time, as one  innocent heart preached that great sermon to another, and no one hushed  it. When it ceased at last, and Mrs. Bhaer went to take away the lamp,  Demi was gone and Nat fast asleep, lying with his face toward the  picture, as if he had already learned to love the Good Man who loved  little children, and was a faithful friend to the poor. The boy's face  was very placid, and as she looked at it she felt that if a single day  of care and kindness had done so much, a year of patient cultivation  would surely bring a grateful harvest from this neglected garden, which  was already sown with the best of all seed by the little missionary in  the night-gown.        CHAPTER IV. STEPPING-STONES    When Nat went into school on Monday morning, he quaked inwardly, for now  he thought he should have to display his ignorance before them all. But  Mr. Bhaer gave him a seat in the deep window, where he could turn his  back on the others, and Franz heard him say his lessons there, so no one  could hear his blunders or see how he blotted his copybook. He was truly  grateful for this, and toiled away so diligently that Mr. Bhaer said,  smiling, when he saw his hot face and inky fingers:    \"Don't work so hard, my boy; you will tire yourself out, and there is  time enough.\"    \"But I must work hard, or I can't catch up with the others. They know  heaps, and I don't know anything,\" said Nat, who had been reduced to a  state of despair by hearing the boys recite their grammar, history, and  geography with what he thought amazing ease and accuracy.    \"You know a good many things which they don't,\" said Mr. Bhaer, sitting  down beside him, while Franz led a class of small students through the  intricacies of the multiplication table.    \"Do I?\" and Nat looked utterly incredulous.    \"Yes; for one thing, you can keep your temper, and Jack, who is quick  at numbers, cannot; that is an excellent lesson, and I think you have  learned it well. Then, you can play the violin, and not one of the lads  can, though they want to do it very much. But, best of all, Nat, you  really care to learn something, and that is half the battle. It seems  hard at first, and you will feel discouraged, but plod away, and things  will get easier and easier as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#8)"],[1,"llustration: Beaver using his Tail as a Trowel]    Similarly in 1897 the largest Beaver pond in the Park was at Obsidian  Cliff. I should say the dam there was over four hundred yards long. But  now it is broken and the pond is drained. And the reason as before--the  Beavers used all the food and moved on. Of course the dam is soon broken  when the hardworking ones are not there in their eternal vigilance to  keep it tight.    There are many good Beaver ponds near Yancey's now and probably made by  the same colonies of Beavers as those I studied there.    Last September I found a fine lots of dams and dammers on the southeast  side of Yellowstone Lake where you may go on a camera hunt with  certainty of getting Beaver pictures. Yes, in broad daylight.    Let me correct here some popular errors about the Beaver:    It does not use its tail as a trowel.    It does not use big logs in building a dam.    It does not and cannot drive stakes.    It cannot throw a tree in any given way.    It finishes the lodge outside with sticks, not mud.      THE OTTER AND HIS SLIDE    [Illustration]    Every one of us that ever was a small boy and rejoiced in belly-bumping  down some icy hill, on a sled of glorious red, should have a brotherly  sympathy for the Otter.    While in a large sense this beautiful animal belongs to the Weasel  family, it has so far progressed that it is one of the merriest,  best-natured, unsanguinary creatures that ever caught their prey alive.  This may be largely owing to the fact that it has taken entirely to a  fish diet; for without any certain knowledge of the reason, we observe  that fisherfolk are gentler than hunterfolk, and the Otter among his  Weasel kin affords a good illustration of this.    We find the animals going through much the same stages as we do. First,  the struggle for food, then for mates, and later, when they have no  cause to worry about either, they seek for entertainment. Quite a number  of our animals have invented amusements. Usually these are mere games of  tag, catch, or tussle, but some have gone farther and have a regular  institution, with a set place to meet, and apparatus provided. This is  the highest form of all, and one of the best illustrations of it is  found in the jovial Otter. Coasting is an established game with this  animal; and probably every individual of the species frequents some  Otter slide. This is any convenient steep hill or bank, sloping down  into deep water, prepared by much use, and worn into a smooth shoot  that becomes especially serviceable when snow or ice are there to act as  lightning lubricants. And here the Otters will meet, old and young, male  and female, without any thought but the joy of fun together, and shoot  down one after the other, swiftly, and swifter still, as the hill grows  smooth with use, and plump into the water and out again; and chase each  other with little animal gasps of glee, each striving to make the shoot  more often and more quickly than the others. And all of this charming  scene, this group and their merry game, is unquestionably for the simple  social joy of being together in an exercise which gives to them the  delicious, exhilarating sensation of speeding through space without  either violence or effort. In fact, for the very same reason that you  and I went coasting when we were boys.    Do not fail to get one of the guides to show you the Otter slides as you  travel about the lake. Some of them are good and some are poor. The very  best are seen after the snow has come, but still you can see them with  your own eyes, and if you are very lucky and very patient you may be  rewarded by the sight of these merry creatures indulging in a game which  closely parallels so many of our own.                 *       *       *       *       *    IV    Horns and Hoofs and Legs of Speed           *       *       *       *       *          IV    Horns and Hoofs and Legs of Speed      THE BOUNDING BLACKTAIL    When Lewis and Clark reached the Big Sioux River in Dakota, on their  famous journey up the Missouri, one hundred and ten years ago, they met,  on the very edge and beginning of its range, the Mule Deer, and added  the new species to their collection.    It is the characteristic Deer of the rough country from Mexico to  British Columbia, and from California to Manitoba; and is one of the  kinds most easily observed in the Yellowstone Sanctuary.    [Illustration]    Driving from Gardiner, passing under the Great Tower of Eagle Rock on  which an Osprey has nested year after year as far back as the records  go, and wheeling into the open space in front of the Mammoth Hot Springs  Hotel, one is almost sure to come on a family of Deer wandering across  the lawn, or posing among the shrubbery, with all the artless grace of  the truly wild creature. These are the representatives of several  hundred that collect in fall on and about this lawn, but are now  scattered for the summer season over the adjoining hills, to come again,  no doubt in increased numbers, when the first deep snow shall warn them  to seek their winter range.    Like the other animals, these are natives of the region and truly wild,  but so educated by long letting alone that it is easy to approach within  a few yards.    The camera hunter should not fail to use this opportunity, not only  because they are wild and beautiful things, but because he can have the  films developed at the hotel over night, and so find out how his camera  is behaving in this new light and surroundings.    [Illustration]    This is the common Blacktailed Deer of the hill country, called Mule  Deer on account of its huge ears and the shape of its tail. In Canada I  knew it by the name of \"Jumping Deer,\" from its gait, and in the Rockies  it is familiar as the \"Bounding Blacktail\"--\"Bounding\" because of the  wonderful way in which it strikes the ground with its legs held stiffly,  then rises in the air with little apparent effort, and lands some ten or  fifteen feet away. As the hunters say, \"The Blacktail hits only the high  places in the landscape.\" On the level it does not run so well as the  Antelope or the Whitetailed Deer, and I often wondered why it had  adopted this laborious mode of speeding, which seemed so inferior to the  normal pace of its kin. But at length I was eyewitness of an episode  that explained the puzzle.      THE MOTHER BLACKTAIL'S RACE FOR LIFE    [Illustration]    In the fall of 1897 I was out for a Wolf hunt with the Eaton boys in the  Badlands near Medora, N. D. We had a fine mixed pack of dogs, trailers,  runners, and fighters. The runners were thoroughbred greyhounds, that  could catch any four-foot on the plains except perhaps a buck Antelope;  that I saw them signally fail in. But a Wolf, or even the swift Coyote,  had no chance of getting away from them provided they could keep him in  view. We started one of these singers of the plains, and at first he set  off trusting to his legs, but the greyhounds were after him, and when he  saw his long start shrinking so fearfully fast he knew that his legs  could not save him, that now was the time for wits to enter the game.  And this entry he made quickly and successfully by dropping out of sight  down a brushy canyon, so the greyhounds saw him no more.    Then they were baffled by Prairie-dogs which dodged down out of reach  and hawks which rose up out of reach, and still we rode, till, rounding  a little knoll near a drinking place, we came suddenly on a mother  Blacktail and her two fawns. All three swung their big ears and eyes  into full bearing on us, and we reined our horses and tried to check our  dogs, hoping they had not seen the quarry that we did not wish to harm.  But Bran the leader gave a yelp, then leaping high over the sage,  directed all the rest, and in a flash it was a life and death race.    Again and frantically the elder Eaton yelled \"Come back!\" and his  brother tried to cut across and intercept the hounds. But a creature  that runs away is an irresistible bait to a greyhound, and the chase  across the sage-covered flat was on, with every nerve and tendon  strained.    [Illustration: X. Blacktail Family  _Photo by E. T. Seton_]    Away went the Blacktail, bounding, bounding at that famous beautiful,  birdlike, soaring pace, mother and young tapping the ground and sailing  to land, and tap and sail again. And away went the greyhounds, low  coursing, outstretched, bounding like bolts from a crossbow, curving but  little and dropping only to be shot again. They were straining hard; the  Blacktail seemed to be going more easily, far more beautifully. But  alas! they were losing time. The greyhounds were closing; in vain we  yelled at them. We spurred our horses, hoping to cut them off, hoping to  stop the ugly, lawless tragedy. But the greyhounds were frantic now. The  distance between Bran and the hindmost fawn was not forty feet. Then  Eaton drew his revolver and fired shots over the greyhounds' heads,  hoping to scare them into submission, but they seemed to draw fresh  stimulus from each report, and yelped and bounded faster. A little more  and the end would be. Then we saw a touching sight. The hindmost fawn  let out a feeble bleat of distress, and the mother, heeding, dropped  back between. It looked like choosing death, for now she had not twenty  feet of lead. I wanted Eaton to use his gun on the foremost hound, when  something unexpected happened. The flat was crossed, the Blacktail  reached a great high butte, and tapping with their toes they soared some  fifteen feet and tapped again; and tapped and tapped and soared, and so  they went like hawks that are bounding in the air, and the greyhounds,  peerless on the plain, were helpless on the butte. Yes! rush as they  might and did, and bounded and clomb, but theirs was not the way of the  hills. In twenty heartbeats they were left behind. The Blacktail mother  with her twins kept on and soared and lightly soared till"]]]
