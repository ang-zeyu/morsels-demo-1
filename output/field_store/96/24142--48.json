[FIGURE] But by this contrivance we gain a greater extent of motion,  and also a greater velocity, and both with less contraction. Let A be  the centre of motion, or articulation; B the insertion of a muscle,  and AC the length of the lever or bone; then, by a contraction only  equal to B_b_, C is carried through C_c_, which is to B_b_ as AC to AB.  It is obvious also, that the velocity is greater, since C moves to _c_  in the same time as B to _b_.    A loss of power is likewise occasioned by the obliquity of the  muscular action, and the oblique direction of the fibres.    For, in this case, there is a compound of two forces, and a  consequent loss of power: for the forces are proportioned to the two  sides of a parallelogram, but the effects produced are proportioned  only to the diagonal.    LECTURE II.  RESPIRATION.    In the last lecture I took a short view of the human body, as a  moving machine, regulated by the will. We shall now proceed to  examine some of its functions more particularly.    I need not tell any of my audience, how necessary air is to the  living body; for every person knows that we cannot live when excluded  from this fluid; but, before we can understand the manner in which it  acts on the body, we must become acquainted with some of its  properties.    That the air is a fluid, consisting of such particles as have little  or no cohesion, and which slide easily among each other, and yield to  the slightest force, is evident from the ease with which animals  breathe it, and move through it. Indeed from its being transparent,  and therefore invisible, as well as from its extreme tenuity, and the  ease with which bodies move through it, people will scarcely believe  that they are living at the bottom of an aerial ocean, like fishes at  the bottom of the sea. We become, however, very sensible of it, when  it flows rapidly in streams or currents, so as to form what is called  a wind, which will sometimes act so violently as to tear up the  strongest trees by the roots, and blow down to the ground the best  and firmest buildings.    Some may still be inclined to ask, what is this air in which we are  said to live? We see nothing; we feel nothing; we find ourselves at  liberty to move about in any direction, without any hindrance. Whence  then comes the assertion, that we are surrounded by a fluid, called  air? When we pour water out of a vessel, it appears to be empty; for  our senses do not inform us that any thing occupies the place of the  water, for instance, when we pour water out of a vial. But this  operation is exactly similar to pouring out mercury from a vial in a  jar of water, the water gets in and supplies the place of the  mercury; so does the air which supplies the place of the water; and  this air will prevent water from rising, or filling a vessel which  contains it.    Hence we see that air possesses similar appearances of  impenetrability with other matter: for it excludes bodies from the  space which itself occupies.    Air being therefore material must have weight; and we shall  accordingly find, that a quart of it weighs about fifteen grains. But  a quart of water weighs about two pounds; this fluid therefore is  nearly a thousand times heavier than air.    But though air is so much lighter than water, yet, because it extends  to a considerable height above the surface of the earth, it is  evident, that it must press strongly on the surfaces of bodies. It is  thought to extend nearly fifty miles above the surface of the earth,  and must therefore press heavily on this surface. This may be evinced  by different experiments, performed by means of the air pump.    Another property of the air, by which it is distinguished from most  other fluids, is its elasticity. It may be compressed into a less  space than it naturally occupies, and when the compressing force is  removed, it expands to its former bulk, by its spring or elasticity.  Indeed it is always compressed into less space than it would  naturally occupy, by the weight of the superincumbent air.    The trachea, or windpipe, commences at the further end of the mouth,  between the root of the tongue, and the passage into the stomach: its  upper part is termed the larynx; it forms the projection in the fore  part of the neck, which is more prominent in the male than the  female: its opening is called the glottis, and is covered with a  small valve, or lid, called the epiglottis, which is open while we  breathe, but shuts when we swallow any thing, to prevent its getting  into the lungs: sometimes, however, particularly when we attempt to  speak at the time we swallow, a small portion of our food or drink  gets into the larynx, and excites violent coughing until it is thrown  back again.    The windpipe is composed of cartilaginous rings, covered with  membrane, which keep it open: after having run downwards for the  space of a few inches, it divides into two great branches, each of  which is subdivided into a vast number of ramifications, ultimately  terminating in little vesicles, which, when distended with air, make  up the greatest part of the bulk of the lungs.    The cavity in which the lungs are contained is called the thorax, or  chest: and is bounded by the ribs, and backbone or spine, and  separated from the abdomen by a muscular membrane, called the  diaphragm. The thorax, by the action of the diaphragm and intercostal  muscles, is alternately enlarged and diminished. Suppose then the  thorax to be in its least state; if it become larger, a vacuum will  be formed, into which the external air will descend by its weight,  filling and distending the vesicles of the lungs.    The thorax, thus dilated, is brought back to its former magnitude,  principally by the relaxation of the muscles, which distended it, and  the natural elasticity of the parts, aided by the contraction of the  abdominal muscles; the thorax being thus diminished, a quantity of  air is expelled from the lungs. The muscles which distend the thorax  beginning again to act, the air reenters; and this alternate dilatation  and contraction, is called respiration. The entrance of the air into  the lungs, is termed inspiration, and its expulsion, expiration.    To form a more accurate idea of the manner in which respiration is  performed, let us suppose this room to be filled with water. On  enlarging the thorax, in the manner before mentioned, the water by  its weight would rush in, and fill the newly formed void; and, upon  the diminution of the capacity of the thorax, a part of this water  would be expelled. Just in the same manner the air will alternately  enter and be expelled from the lungs by this alternate dilatation and  contraction of the thorax.    Respiration is a function of such consequence, that death follows if  it is suspended for a few minutes only. By means of this function the  blood is elaborated, and rendered fit to nourish the body; by means  of it the system is, most probably, supplied with irritability; by  means of it the nervous energy is, most likely, conveyed into the  body, to be expended in sensation, and muscular motion. It appears,  likewise, that in this way, animals are supplied with that heat which  preserves their temperatures nearly the same, whatever may be the  temperatures of surrounding bodies.    If any number of inanimate bodies, possessed of different degrees of  heat, be placed near each other, the heat will begin to pass from the  hotter bodies to the colder, till there be an equilibrium of  temperature. But this is by no means the case with respect to  animated matter; for whatever be the degree of heat peculiar to  individual animals, they preserve it, nearly unchanged, in every  temperature, provided the temperature be not altogether incompatible  with life or health. Thus, we find, from experiments that have been  made, that the human body is not only capable of supporting, in  certain circumstances, without any material change in its  temperature, a degree of heat considerably above that at which water  boils; but it likewise maintains its usual temperature, whilst the  surrounding medium is several degrees below frost.    It is evident, therefore, that animals neither receive their heat  from the bodies which surround them, nor suffer, from the influence  of external circumstances, any material alterations in that heat  which is peculiar to their nature. These general facts are confirmed  and elucidated by many accurate and well authenticated observations,  which show, that the degree of heat in the same genus and species of  the more perfect animals, continues uniformly the same, whether they  be surrounded by mountains of snow, in the neighbourhood of the pole,  or exposed to a vertical sun, in the sultry regions of the torrid  zone.    This stability and uniformity of animal heat, under such a disparity  of external circumstances, and so vast a latitude in the temperature  of the ambient air, prove, beyond doubt, that the living body is  furnished with a peculiar mechanism, or power of generating,  supporting, and regulating its own temperature; and that this is so  wisely adapted to the circumstances of its economy, or so dependent  upon them, that, whatever be the temperature of the atmosphere, it  will have very little influence either in diminishing or increasing  that of the animal.    In order that we may see how this effect is produced, we must examine  the chemical properties of the air. Previously to this, however, it  will be necessary to point out briefly how bodies are affected, with  respect to heat, when they change their form.    When a body passes from a state of solidity to that of fluidity, it  absorbs a quantity of heat, which becomes chemically combined with  it, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#8)"],[1,"  some of the better sanitary dairies, it is customary to have a special  milking room that is arranged with special reference to the elimination  of all dust. In this way this source of infection may be quite obviated  as the air of a clean, still room is relatively free from bacteria,  especially if the floor is moistened. It has often been noted that the  milk of stall-fed animals does not keep as well as that milked out of  doors, a condition in part attributable to the lessened contamination.    [Illustration: FIG. 11. Effect of contaminated air. The number of spots  indicate the colonies that have developed from the bacteria which fell  in 30 seconds on the surface of the gelatin plate (3 inches in  diameter). This exposure was made at time the cows were fed.]    ~Relative importance of different sources of infection.~ It is impossible  to measure accurately the influence of the different sources of  infection as these are continually subject to modification in each and  every case. As a general rule, however, where milk is drawn and handled  without any special care, the utensils and the animal contribute the  larger proportion of dirt and bacteria that find their way into milk.  Where the manner of milking and handling is designed to exclude the  largest number of organisms possible, the bacteria appearing in the fore  milk make up the major portion remaining. By putting into practice the  various suggestions that have been made with reference to diminishing  the bacterial content of milk, it is possible to greatly reduce the  number of organisms found therein, and at the same time materially  improve the keeping quality of the milk. Backhaus[38] estimates that  the germ life in milk can be easily reduced to one-two thousandth of its  original number by using care in milking. He reports a series of  experiments covering two years in which milk was secured that averaged  less than 10,000 bacteria per cc., while that secured under ordinary  conditions averaged over 500,000.    [Illustration: FIG. 12. Bacterial content of milk handled in ordinary  way. Each spot represents a colony growing on gelatin plate. Compare  with Fig. 13, where same quantity of milk is used in making culture.  Over 15,000 bacteria per cc. in this milk.]    Fig. 13 gives an illustration as to what care in milking will do in the  way of eliminating bacteria. Fig. 12 shows a gelatin plate seeded with  the same quantity of milk that was used in making the culture indicated  by Fig. 13. The first plate was inoculated with milk drawn under good  conditions, the germ content of which was found to be 15,500 bacteria  per cc., while the sample secured under as nearly aseptic conditions as  possible (Fig. 13) contained only 330 organisms in the same volume.    [Illustration: FIG. 13. Bacterial content of milk drawn with care.  Diminished germ content is shown by smaller number of colonies (330  bacteria per cc.). Compare this culture with that shown in Fig. 12.]    ~\"Sanitary\" or \"certified\" milk.~ Within recent years there has been more  or less generally introduced into many cities, the custom of supplying  high grade milk that has been handled in a way so as to diminish its  germ content as much as possible. Milk of this character is frequently  known as \"sanitary,\" \"hygienic\" or \"certified,\" the last term being used  in connection with a certification from veterinary authorities or boards  of health as to the freedom of animals from contagious disease.  Frequently a numerical bacterial standard is exacted as a pre-requisite  to the recommendation of the board of examining physicians. Thus, the  Pediatric Society of Philadelphia requires all children's milk that  receives its recommendation to have not more than 10,000 bacteria per  cc. Such a standard has its value in the scrupulous cleanliness that  must prevail in order to secure these results. This in itself is  practically a guarantee of the absence of those bacteria liable to  produce trouble in children. The number of organisms found in such milks  is surprisingly low when compared with ordinary milk. Naturally, there  is considerable fluctuation from day to day, and occasionally the germ  content is increased to a high figure without any apparent reason. The  average results though, show a greatly reduced number of organisms. De  Schweinitz[39] found in a Washington dairy in 113 examinations extending  throughout a year, an average of 6,485 bacteria per cc. The daily  analyses made of the Walker-Gordon supply sold in Philadelphia for an  entire year, showed that the milk almost always contained less than  5,000 bacteria per cc. and on 120 days out of the year the germ content  was 1,000 organisms per cc. or less.    From a practical point of view, the improvement in quality of sanitary  milk, in comparison with the ordinary product is seen in the enhanced  keeping quality. During the Paris Exposition in 1900, milk and cream  from several such dairies in the United States were shipped to Paris,  arriving in good condition after 15 to 18 days transit. When milk has  been handled in such a way, it is evident that it is much better suited  to serve as a food supply than where it has undergone the fermentative  changes incident to the development of myriads of organisms.    ~Application of foregoing precautions to all milk producers.~ Milk is so  susceptible to bacterial changes that it is necessary to protect it from  invasion, if its original purity is to be maintained, and yet, from a  practical point of view, the use to which it is destined has much to do  with the care necessary to take in handling. The effect of the bacterial  contamination of milk depends largely upon the way in which the product  is used. To the milk-man engaged in the distribution of milk for direct  consumption, all bacterial life is more or less of a detriment, while to  the butter-maker and cheese-maker some forms are a direct necessity. It  is unnecessary and impracticable to require the same degree of care in  handling milk destined to be worked up into factory products as is done,  for instance, in sanitary milk supplies, but this fact should not be  interpreted to mean that the care of milk for factories is a matter of  small consequence. In fact no more important dairy problem exists, and  the purer and better the quality of the raw material the better the  product will be. Particularly is this true with reference to  cheese-making.    Dairymen have learned many lessons in the severe school of experience,  but it is earnestly to be hoped that future conditions will not be  summed up in the words of the eminent German dairy scientist, Prof.  Fleischmann, when he says that \"all the results of scientific  investigation which have found such great practical application in the  treatment of disease, in disinfection, and in the preservation of  various products, are almost entirely ignored in milking.\"    ~Growth of bacteria in milk.~ Milk is so well suited as a medium for the  development of germ life that it might be expected that all  microorganisms would develop rapidly therein, and yet, as a matter of  fact, growth does not begin at once, even though the milk may be richly  seeded. At ordinary temperatures, such as 70 deg. F., no appreciable  increase is to be noted for a period of 6-9 hours; at lower temperatures  (54 deg. F.) this period is prolonged to 30-40 hours or even longer. After  this period has elapsed, active growth begins and continues more or less  rapidly until after curdling.    The cause of this suspended development is attributed to the germicidal  properties inherent to the milk.[40]    Milk is of course seeded with a considerable variety of organisms at  first. The liquefying and inert species are the most abundant, the  distinctively lactic acid class occurring sparsely, if at all. As milk  increases in age, germ growth begins to occur. More or less development  of all types go on, but soon the lactic species gain the ascendency,  owing to their being better suited to this environment; they soon  outstrip all other species, with the result that normal curdling  generally supervenes. The growth of this type is largely conditioned by  the presence of the milk sugar. If the sugar is removed from milk by  dialysis, the liquid undergoes putrefactive changes due to the fact that  the putrefactive bacteria are able to grow if no acid is produced.    ~Relation of temperature to growth.~ When growth does once begin in milk,  the temperature at which it is stored exerts the most profound effect on  the rate of development. When milk is not artificially cooled, it  retains its heat for some hours, and consequently the conditions become  very favorable for the rapid multiplication of the contained organisms,  as is shown in following results obtained by Freudenreich[41]:        _No. of bacteria per cc. in milk kept at different temperatures._                                     77 deg. F.       95 deg. F.       5 hrs. after milking       10,000        30,000       8  \"     \"    \"            25,000    12,000,000      12  \"     \"    \"            46,000    35,280,000      26  \"     \"    \"         5,700,000    50,000,000    [Illustration: FIG. 14. Effect of cooling milk on the growth of  bacteria.]    Conn[42] is inclined to regard temperature of more significance in  determining the keeping quality than the original infection of the milk  itself. Milk which curdled in 18 hours at 98 deg. F., did not curdle in 48  hours at 70 deg., and often did not change in two weeks, if the  temperature was kept at 50 deg. F.    Where kept for a considerable period at this low temperature, the milk  becomes filled with bacteria of the undesirable putrefactive type, the  lactic group being unable to form acid in any appreciable amounts.  Running well water can be used for cooling, if it is possible to secure  it at a temperature of 48 deg.-50 deg. F. The use of ice, of course, gives  better results, and in"]]]
