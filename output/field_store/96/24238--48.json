If, however, the diarrhoea should  continue persistent, then professional advice should be obtained.          WATER.      Water (_pani_).    Horses prefer soft to hard water, and are particularly partial to  rain-water. Many horses refuse to drink at all from a running stream,  unless very thirsty, and even then will not take as much as is necessary.  Mules, which in other respects are hardy animals, are very dainty and  particular about their water. Such horses should be watered either out of  a bucket or a still pool. In mountain and quick running streams there is  often a large quantity of sand and small gravel held in suspension, that  sinks to the bottom in places where the current runs slow. I have seen  more than one death caused by constantly watering horses in such streams,  by the animal swallowing a quantity of such sand; it accumulates in large  masses in the intestines, and causes \"sand colic.\" If it is necessary to  water horses from such places for any length of time, if a suitable pool  cannot be found where the water is still and the sand and gravel can  settle, one should be made by building a dam.      Times of Watering.    Horses should be watered half an hour before feeding, or, if this cannot  be managed, at least two hours should elapse after the feed before he is  allowed to drink his fill. The reason of this is that the hard grain the  horse eats is only partly crushed and broken by the teeth, and it is in  the stomach where it is principally softened before passing on into the  intestines. If, when the stomach is full of partly digested food, a large  quantity of water is given, some of it will be washed into the intestine,  and, being hard, and not properly softened, irritate it and set up colic.  The best plan is to always have water in front of the horse, so that he  can drink when he likes, and I have found that they take much less this  way than when watered at regular times. In India this can be easily done  by building up in mud a wide-mouthed, shallow, earthen vessel, called a  \"gumalo,\" in one corner of the stable, in the same way that a manger is  made. It should be high enough for the horse to conveniently reach it, and  be kept constantly full.      Watering Troughs.    When horses are watered at a trough or stream, as is necessarily the case  with military animals, if they are thirsty they push their noses deep into  it and drink greedily. They then lift their heads and look round them, and  many persons think they have finished. This is not the case, as the horse  is merely recovering his breath after his draught, and he should not be  taken away until he either turns round and will drink no more, or until he  begins to splash the water about with his nose and play with it, which  shows he does not want any more.      Watering on a Journey.    It is commonly supposed that when on a journey horses should not be  watered, but, in a warm climate, as long as only a steady pace is  maintained and only a moderate quantity given, it does not do any harm,  and, to judge from one's own experiences, certainly is refreshing. Of  course, this must be done in moderation, like everything; and it  undoubtedly would be dangerous to allow a horse to drink his fill and then  give him a hard gallop directly afterwards; but, in both the South African  and Australian colonies, I have travelled some hundreds of miles in  post-carts and coaches, and the drivers at pretty nearly every stream they  cross pull up and allow the horses to drink a few mouthfuls. I have never  heard of any harm coming from this practice, and at the end of the journey  they drink far less water than if they had been deprived of it while at  work. In Norway, the carriole drivers water their ponies in the same way,  and it is icy-cold coming from the glaciers.      Watering after a Journey.    When the journey is completed, it is advisable to walk the horse about for  a short time, to allow him to get cool before watering; or, better still,  and what every practical horseman will do, is to pull up and allow him to  walk the last mile, so that he arrives at his stable fairly cool, and not  reeking with perspiration. Grooming also will be greatly facilitated by  this.      Watering Bridles (_kazai_).    Watering bridles are generally very much neglected, \"syces\" (grooms) never  seeming to think that they require any care or attention. They are  generally a mass of rust and dirt, and having one of these filthy things  put into the mouth, is a much more common cause of horses going off their  feed than is generally supposed. They are frequently thrown out on the  heap of bedding, and left in the sun all day, and when put into the  horse's mouth the iron of the bit is burning hot. I consider that this is  one of the chief reasons of the sores that so frequently form at the  angles of the mouth in the summer months, and which are most troublesome  to cure. The bit of the watering bridle should be scrubbed daily with sand  until it is polished, and the leather-work cleaned with soap (sabon) or  dubbing (momrogan); if this is not done, it very soon perishes with the  heat and becomes rotten, and if a horse is at all fresh and plays about,  it breaks, the animal gets loose, and a serious accident is the result of  the want of a little forethought.      Leeches (_jonk_).    In India leeches frequently get into the nose while the horse is drinking,  especially out of ponds and streams, and although they are not absolutely  dangerous, they cause troublesome bleeding, and make the animal cough and  sneeze. They are sometimes very difficult to get rid off, and the best  plan is to place some water in a bucket before the horse and splash it  about. The leech is attracted by this, and comes down the nostril, when  it can be caught if the operator is quick enough. A handkerchief is  necessary, as the leech is too slippery to hold in the fingers. It is  generally best to let one of the \"syces\" do this, promising him a small  reward when the nuisance is got rid of, as some of them are wonderfully  expert at it, and have untiring patience.      Wells.    In some Indian towns there is a water supply laid on to the houses by  pipes, but in the majority it is obtained from a well (khua) in the  compound. In these cases a water-carrier (\"bheestie\") has to be kept to  draw and carry water for the household and stables, which he brings in a  leather bag; \"mussuk,\" the small leather bucket that he uses to fill the  bag with, being called a \"dholl.\" These water-bags should be renewed twice  a year, as they get very foul inside if kept much longer, and they are  only worth about Rs. 2 each. Very few people ever think of cleaning out  the well, but it should be done at least once a year, as it is surprising  the amount of rubbish, such as dead leaves and vegetation, gets into it.  The landlord of the house should undertake this, but it is generally  difficult to get him to do it without the tenant threatening to do it  himself and deduct the cost out of the rent. There are professional  well-cleaners in Northern India, who will do the work by contract. As a  rule, it takes about three days, as the well has to be pumped dry by  working the lifting wheel with relays of bullocks day and night, when a  man goes down and removes the accumulation of rubbish from the bottom.  Care should be taken to first lower down a lighted candle, or throw a  bundle of lighted straw down before any one is allowed to descend, as  there is frequently an accumulation of foul gas at the bottom, and I have  known more than one accident from neglect of this precaution. Unless I had  very good reason for knowing that the well had been lately cleaned, I  always had this done on going into a new house. If this is neglected, the  water during the rainy season is apt to get very foul, and I have known  severe outbreaks of illness from this cause both in men and animals.          AIR AND VENTILATION.      Stables.    Nothing is worse for horses than close, ill-ventilated stables, and in  India, where they are made out of such cheap material as mud and sun-dried  brick, there is no excuse for their being too small. In some of the newer  houses, stables are made out of burned brick; but I prefer the older ones  of mud or sun-dried brick, as the walls are generally thicker, and this  makes them cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. It is also of  importance that they should not be too low, but of the two evils I should  prefer a small stable with a lofty roof to a larger one with a low one,  provided there was ventilation in the top. Every stable should have a good  deep verandah round it; it not only keeps off the sun in the summer, but  is useful to put bedding, etc., in during the rain. If there is no  verandah, one can be easily made with the flat straw screens used by  natives, called \"jamps,\" and bamboo supports. The doorways should be high  and wide, so that there is no danger of the horse hitting his hips or head  against it in going in and out. A fractured hip-bone is frequently caused  by horses rushing through narrow doorways, and a troublesome disease known  as \"poll evil\" is generally caused by striking the head against too low a  one. It is also well to have the sides of the door-posts rounded off, not  left at an angle. If there is no window at the back of the stable,  opposite the door, one should be made above the horse's head, and another  smaller one on a level with the floor, so as to allow the air to circulate  freely. If possible, avoid a draught, but always remember that it is  better to have plenty of fresh air and a draught than a stuffy stable  without one, as the horse can always be kept warm with extra clothing,  bandages, and bedding. Thatched roofs are much cooler "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#8)"],[1,".    This insular species is closely related to _Sylvilagus bachmani_ and is  distinguished by paleness, proportionately longer and narrower skull,  fusion to skull of anterior arm of supraorbital process, and larger  jugal.      =Sylvilagus palustris=    Marsh Rabbit    (See figure 42)    Total length, 425-440; tail, 33-39; hind foot, 88-91; ear from notch  (dry), 45-52. Upper parts blackish brown or reddish brown; underside of  tail brownish or dingy gray (not white); ears, tail and hind feet short;  posterior and anterior extensions of supraorbital processes joined to  skull along most (or all) of their extent. The lack of white on the  underside of the tail is a ready means of distinguishing this species  from the other species of the genus which occur within its geographic  range. The species occurs in the lowlands, possibly not above 500 feet  altitude, of the Lower Austral and Tropical life-zones. In Florida,  Blair (1936) found that the marsh rabbit ate 29 per cent of its bodily  weight in green food each day and that the number of embryos in 3  females was 4, 4 and 3.

The geographic range is the largest of all of the  North American species of the genus _Sylvilagus_; from Canada the  species occurs south at least to Costa Rica and it may occur in Panam['a]  for the species is recorded also from South America.    In the western part of the Great Plains this species is confined to the  riparian growth along streams and _Sylvilagus audubonii_ occupies the  remainder of the terrain. In New Mexico and southwestern Texas _S.  floridanus_ is confined to the boreal life-zones where timber provides  denser cover than is found in the lower life-zones. The zonal range is  from the Canadian Life-zone into the Tropical Life-zone. It is not  surprising, therefore, that there is much geographic variation in the  shape and size of the skull. There is so much geographic variation in  the skull that it is impossible, at this writing at least, to frame a  description that will enable the reader to distinguish the skull from  those of all other species of the genus. In any given area, however, it  is possible, easily and certainly, to distinguish the skulls of _S.  floridanus_ from those of the other species which occur in that area.
