We have outlived the old standards; we have burst, like an            over-tight thong,      The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong.\"        Then the Master feared for His angel, and called him again to His side,      For oh, the woman was wondrous, and oh, the angel was tried.      And deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was the strain of his            song:      \"The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong.\"          THE RHYME OF THE RESTLESS ONES          We couldn't sit and study for the law;        The stagnation of a bank we couldn't stand;      For our riot blood was surging, and we didn't need much urging      To excitements and excesses that are banned.      So we took to wine and drink and other things,        And the devil in us struggled to be free;      Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path,      And they paid our debts and packed us o'er the sea.        Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam,      To the larger lands that lure a man to roam;              And we took the chance they gave              Of a far and foreign grave,      And we bade goodbye for evermore to home.        And some of us are climbing on the peak,        And some of us are camping on the plain;      By pine and palm you'll find us, with never claim to bind us,      By track and trail you'll meet us once again.        We are fated serfs to freedom--sky and sea;        We have failed where slummy cities overflow;      But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth,      And we go into the dark as fighters go.        Yes, we go into the night as brave men go,      Though our faces they be often streaked with woe;              Yet we're hard as cats to kill,              And our hearts are reckless still,      And we've danced with death a dozen times or so.        And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,        And you'll find us herding cattle in the South.      We like strong drink and fun; and when the race is run,        We often die with curses in our mouth.        We are wild as colts unbroke, but never mean;        Of our sins we've shoulders broad to bear the blame;      But we'll never stay in town, and we'll never settle down,        And we'll never have an object or an aim.        No, there's that in us that time can never tame;      And life will always seem a careless game;              And they'd better far forget--              Those who say they love us yet--      Forget, blot out with bitterness our name.          NEW YEAR'S EVE          It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;        Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;      And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad            New Year,        Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.        They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon, and it's cheery and            bright in there        (God! but I'm weak--since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);      I'll just go over and slip inside--I mustn't give way to despair--        Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.        They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me, and they'll call me a            whiskey soak;        (\"Have a drink? Well, thankee kindly, sir, I don't mind if I do.\")      A drivelling, dirty gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;        Sunk and sodden and hopeless--\"Another? Well, here's to you!\"        McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;        The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got            fired;      I'll just sneak into a corner, and they'll let me alone a bit;        The room is reeling round and round ... O God, but I'm tired, I'm            tired....               *       *       *       *       *        Roses she wore on her breast that night. Oh, but their scent was sweet;        Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;      The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,        And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of            love.        Then sudden the laughter died on her lips, and lowly she bent her head;        And oh, there came in the deep, dark eyes a look that was heaven            to see      And the moments went, and I waited there, and never a word was said,        And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red, and shyly gave it to            me.        Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up            like day;        And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny            brow;      \"She is mine, she is mine for evermore!\" the violins seemed to say,        And the bells were ringing the New Year in--O God! I can hear them            now.        Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad            refrain?        Don't you remember that last goodbye, and the dear eyes dim with            tears?      Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,        Of lives that would blend like an angel-song in the bliss of the            coming year?        Oh, what have I lost! What have I lost! Ethel, forgive, forgive!        The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.      'Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live!        I have sinned, I have sunk to the lowest depths--but oh, I have            suffered so!        Hark! Oh hark! I can hear the bells!... Look! I can see her there,        Fair as a dream ... but it fades ... And now--I can hear the            dreadful hum      Of the crowded court ... See! the Judge looks down ... NOT GUILTY,            my Lord, I swear ...        The bells, I can hear the bells again ... Ethel, I come, I come!...               *       *       *       *       *        \"Rouse up, old man, it's twelve o'clock. You can't sleep here, you            know.        Say! ain't you got no sentiment? Lift up your muddled head;      Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go--        You darned old dirty hobo ... My God! Here, boys! He's DEAD!\"          COMFORT          Say! You've struck a heap of trouble--        Bust in business, lost your wife;      No one cares a cent about you,        You don't care a cent for life;      Hard luck has of hope bereft you,        Health is failing, wish you'd die--      Why, you've still the sunshine left you,        And the big, blue sky.                Sky so blue it makes you wonder                If it's heaven shining through;              Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,                Sun so bright it dazzles you;              Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging                All their fragrance on the breeze;              Dancing shadows, green, still meadows--                Don't you mope, you've still got these.        These, and none can take them from you;        These, and none can weigh their worth.      What! you're tired and broke and beaten?--        Why, you're rich--you've got the earth!      Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,        While the blue sky bends above,      You've got nearly all that matters,        You've got God, and God is love.          PREMONITION          'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright        (Oh, I remember so well, so well),      I walked with my love in a sea of light,        And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell.            And sudden the moon grew strangely dull,            And sudden my love had taken wing;          I looked on the face of a grinning skull,            I strained to my heart a ghastly thing.        'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still        In my arms with her tender eyes aglow,      And she wondered why my lips were chill,        Why I was silent and kissed her so.            A year has gone and the moon is bright,            A gibbous moon like a ghost of woe;          I sit by a new-made grave to-night,            And my heart is broken--it's strange, you know.          THE TRAMPS          Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped God's land together,        And we sang the old, old Earth-song, for our youth was very sweet;      When we drank and fought and lusted, as we mocked at tie and tether,        Along the road to Anywhere, the wide world at our feet.        Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had its story;        When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest was still unstale;      When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as, bathed in amber glory,        Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale.        Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster;        There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet O we loved it so!      As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was our master,        And no man guessed what dreams were ours, as swinging heel and toe,      We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic road to Anywhere,        The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years ago.          _L'ENVOI_          _You who have lived in the Land,        You who have trusted the trail;      You who are strong to withstand,        You who are swift to assail;      Songs have I sung to beguile,        Vintage of desperate years      Hard as a harlot's smile,        Bitter as unshed tears._                          _Little of joy or mirth,                          Little of ease I sing;                        Sagas of men of earth,                          Humanly suffering,                        Such as you all have done;                          Savagely faring forth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#8)"],[1,"was beginning to understand a little.    \"Perhaps I, too, am standing still, halfway up the stairway of the past.  But of this I am very sure: For us, there will be no return to our own  place. And the time will come when something new shall grow from the  seed of the past. Also it is necessary that you be one of the tenders of  that growth. So I urge you, take Tsoay, and the next time, Lupe. For the  young who may be swayed this way and that by words--as the wind shakes a  small tree--must be given firm roots.\"    In Travis education warred with instinct, just as the picture Redax had  planted in his mind had warred with his awaking to this alien landscape.  Yet now he believed he must be guided by what he felt. And he knew that  no man of his race would claim _go'ndi_, the power of spirit known only  to a great chief, unless he had actually felt it swell within him. It  might have been fostered by hallucination in the past, but the aura of  it carried into the here and now. And Travis had no doubts that Buck  believed implicitly in what he said, and that belief carried credulity  to others.    \"This is wisdom, _Nantan_--\"    Buck shook his head. \"I am no _nantan_, no chief. But of some things I  am sure. You also be sure of what lies within you, younger brother!\"    On the third day, ranging eastward along the base of the mountain range,  Travis found what he believed would be an acceptable camp site. There  was a canyon with a good spring of water cut round by well-marked game  trails. A series of ledges brought him up to a small plateau where scrub  wood could be used to build the wickiups. Water and food lay within  reach, and the ledge approach was easy to defend. Even Deklay and his  fellow malcontents were forced to concede the value of the site.    His duty to the clan accomplished, Travis returned to his own concern,  one which had haunted him for days. Topaz had been taped by men of the  vanished star empire. Therefore, the planet was important, but why? As  yet he had found no indication that anything above the intelligence  level of the split horns was native to this world. But he was gnawed by  the certainty that there _was_ something here, waiting.... And the  desire to learn what it was became an ever-burning ache.    Perhaps he was what Deklay had accused him of being, one who had come to  follow the road of the Pinda-lick-o-yi too closely. For Travis was  content to scout with only the coyotes for company, and he did not find  the loneliness of the unknown planet as intimidating as most of the  others.    He was checking his small trail pack on the fourth day after they had  settled on the plateau when Buck and Jil-Lee hunkered down beside him.    \"You go to hunt--?\" Buck broke the silence first.    \"Not for meat.\"    \"What do you fear? That _ndendai_--enemy people--have marked this as  their land?\" Jil-Lee questioned.    \"That may be true, but now I hunt for what this world was at one time,  the reason why the ancient star men marked it as their own.\"    \"And this knowledge may be of value to us?\" Jil-Lee asked slowly. \"Will  it bring food to our mouths, shelter for our bodies--mean life for us?\"    \"All that is possible. It is the unknowing which is bad.\"    \"True. Unknowing is always bad,\" Buck agreed. \"But the bow which is  fitted to one hand and strength of arm, may not be suited to another.  Remember that, younger brother. Also, do you go alone?\"    \"With Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu I am not alone.\"    \"Take Tsoay with you also. The four-footed ones are indeed _ga-n_ for  the service of those they like, but it is not good that man walks alone  from his kind.\"    There it was again, the feeling of clan solidarity which Travis did not  always share. On the other hand, Tsoay would not be a hindrance. On  other scouts the boy had proved to have a keen eye for the country and a  liking for experimentation which was not a universal attribute even  among those of his own age.    \"I would go to find a path through the mountains; it may be a long  trail,\" Travis half protested.    \"You believe what you seek may lie to the north?\"    Travis shrugged. \"I do not know. How can I? But it will be another way  of seeking.\"    \"Tsoay shall go. He keeps silent before older warriors as is proper for  the untried, but his thoughts fly free as do yours,\" Buck replied. \"It  is in him also, this need to see new places.\"    \"There is this,\" Jil-Lee got to his feet, \"--do not go so far, brother,  that you may not easily find a way to return. This is a wide land, and  within it we are but a handful of men alone----\"    \"That, too, I know.\" Travis thought he could read more than one kind of  warning in Jil-Lee's words.           *       *       *       *       *    They were the second day away from the plateau camp, and climbing, when  they chanced upon the pass Travis had hoped might exist. Before them lay  an abrupt descent to what appeared to be open plains country cloaked in  a dusky amber Travis now knew was the thick grass found in the southern  valleys. Tsoay pointed with his chin.    \"Wide land--good for horses, cattle, ranches....\"    But all those lay far beyond the black space surrounding them. Travis  wondered if there was any native animal which could serve man in place  of the horse.    \"Do we go down?\" Tsoay asked.    From this point Travis could sight no break far out on the amber plain,  no sign of any building or any disturbance of its smooth emptiness. Yet  it drew him. \"We go,\" he decided.    Close as it had looked from the pass, the plain was yet a day and a  night, spent in careful watching by turns, ahead of them. It was  midmorning of the second day that they left the foothill breaks, and the  grass of the open country was waist high about them. Travis could see it  rippling where the coyotes threaded ahead. Then he was conscious of a  persistent buzzing, a noise which irritated faintly until he was  compelled to trace it to its source.    The grass had been trampled flat for an irregular patch, with a trail  of broken stalks out of the heart of the plain. At one side was a  buzzing, seething mass of glitter-winged insects which Travis already  knew as carrion eaters. They arose reluctantly from their feast as he  approached.    He drew a short breath which was close to a grunt of astounded  recognition. What lay there was so impossible that he could not believe  the evidence of his eyes. Tsoay gave a sharp exclamation, went down on  one knee for a closer examination, then looked at Travis over his  shoulder, his eyes wide, more than a trace of excitement in his voice.    \"Horse dung--and fresh!\"          5      \"There was one horse, unshod but ridden. It came here from the plains  and it had been ridden hard, going lame. There was a rest here, maybe  shortly after dawn.\" Travis sorted out what they had learned by a  careful examination of the ground.    Nalik'ideyu and Naginlta, Tsoay, watched and listened as if the coyotes  as well as the boy could understand every word.    \"There is that also--\" Tsoay indicated the one trace left by the unknown  rider, an impression blurred as if some attempt had been made to conceal  it.    \"Small and light, the rider is both. Also in fear, I think--\"    \"We follow?\" Tsoay asked.    \"We follow,\" Travis assented. He looked to the coyotes, and as he had  learned to do, thought out his message. This trail was the one to be  followed. When the rider was sighted they were to report back if the  Apaches had not yet caught up.    There was no visible agreement; the coyotes simply vanished through the  wall of grass.    \"Then there are others here,\" Tsoay said as he and Travis began their  return to the foothills. \"Perhaps there was a second ship--\"    \"That horse,\" Travis said, shaking his head. \"There was no provision in  the project for the shipping of horses.\"    \"Perhaps they have always been here.\"    \"Not so. To each world its own species of beasts. But we shall know the  truth when we look upon that horse--and its rider.\"    It was warmer this side of the mountains, and the heat of the plains  beat at them. Travis thought that the horse might well be seeking water  if allowed his head. Where did he come from? And why had his rider gone  in haste and fear?    This was rough, broken country and the tired, limping horse seemed to  have picked the easiest way through it, without any hindrance from the  man with him. Travis spotted a soft patch of ground with a deep-set  impression. This time there had been no attempt at erasure; the boot  track was plain. The rider had dismounted and was leading the horse--yet  he was moving swiftly.    They followed the tracks around the bend of a shallow cut and found  Nalik'ideyu waiting for them. Between her forefeet was a bundle still  covered with smears of soft earth, and behind her were drag marks from a  hole under the overhang of a bush. The coyote had plainly just  disinterred her find. Travis squatted down to examine it, using his eyes  before his hands.    It was a bag made of hide, probably the hide of one of the split horns  by its color and the scraps of long hair which had been left in a  simple decorative fringe along the bottom. The sides had been laced  together neatly by someone used to working in leather, the closing flap  lashed down tightly with braided thong loops.    As the Apache leaned closer to it he could smell a mixture of odors--the  hide itself, horse, wood smoke, and other scents--strange to him. He  undid the fastenings and pulled out the contents.    There was a shirt, with long full sleeves, of a gray wool undyed from  the sheep. Then a very bulky short jacket which, after fingering it  doubtfully, Travis decided was made of felt. It was elaborately  decorated with highly colorful embroidery, and there was no mistaking  the design--a heavy antlered Terran deer in mortal combat with what  might be a puma. It was bordered with a geometric pattern of beautiful,  oddly familiar work."]]]
