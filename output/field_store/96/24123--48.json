But in this case my theory did not seem to be working;  for my former chum, whom I remembered as a quiet, unobtrusive fellow,  met my startled glance with a twinkle of suppressed humor. I confess  that such a blow to my theory filled me with indignation.    I stepped toward him, all my moral superiority betraying itself in the  self-satisfied smirk which fixed itself on my face in accordance with  the sense of duty which the Philistine feels so keenly in his relations  with others.    \"Why are you here?\" I asked him.    \"Are you not a little impertinent?\" he asked. \"I do not inquire of you  why you are here.\"    \"That is obvious, to say the least,\" I answered loftily.    \"Obvious from your pharisaical expression, perhaps,\" he said  good-naturedly. \"But never mind! We look at the matter from different  points of view. To me it is a greater indiscretion to annoy a helpless  prisoner with 'holier-than-thou' questions than it would be to attend  the Charity Ball in pajamas. But of course you do not see it in the same  light.\"    \"Pardon me if I annoyed you,\" I said stiffly.    \"Don't mention it,\" he replied, with the humorous twinkle still playing  in his eyes. \"And to prove that I bear no hard feeling, I will ask you  some questions.\"    Naturally I was embarrassed at such an exhibition of hardihood in one in  his situation, but I said I would be pleased to answer him to the best  of my ability.    \"It is some time since I was away from this retreat on a vacation,\" he  said, with an easy assurance that was indescribably shocking to one of  correct principles, \"and I would like to know if all the rascals have  yet been put in prison.\"    I pushed my insurance policy a little deeper into my pocket and replied,  with conviction:    \"Certainly not; but you must not forget that no man is guilty until he  has been proven so.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" he said; \"and that a man may pride himself on his honesty on  the secure ground that he has not yet reached the penitentiary. Yes, of  course, you are right. But, tell me, is it true, according to a rumor  which has reached us in our seclusion, that these good Christians _pro  tem_, are considering the advisability of having rat poison served to us  in place of the delicious stale bread and flat water which now comprise  our bill of fare?\"    \"Oh,\" I answered vaguely, \"there are still reformers of all sorts in the  world.\"    \"Reformers!\" he cried, his face lighting up with a new interest. \"Ah!  you mean those profound thinkers who seek to cure every disease of the  social body by means of legislation. Yes, yes! tell me about them!  Society still believes in them?\"    \"Believes in them!\" I cried indignantly. \"Surely it does. Why, the great  political parties are responding to the cry of the downtrodden masses,  and--\"    \"Oh,\" he said dreamily, \"they are still responding?\"    \"What do you mean by still responding?\" I demanded curtly.    \"Why, I remember that in my time, too, the people always responded. The  party leaders would say to them that they were in a bad way and needed  help. The people would cry out in joy to think their leaders had  discovered this. Then the leaders would wink at each other and jump upon  the platforms and explain to the people that what was needed was a new  law of some sort. The people would weep for happiness at such wisdom and  would beg their leaders to get together and make the law. And the law  that the leaders would make when they got together was one that would  put the people still more in their power. So that is still going on?\"    I recognized that he was ironical, but I answered with a sneer:    \"The people get what they deserve, and what they wish. They have only to  demand through the ballot box, you know.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" he murmured with a grin, \"I had forgotten the ballot box.  Dear me! how could I have forgotten the ballot box?\"    Providentially the keeper came to notify me that my time was up, and I  turned away.    \"One thing more,\" cried the prisoner; \"is it still the case that the  American people enjoy their freedom best when they are enslaved in some  way?\"    \"You are outrageous,\" I exclaimed; \"the American people are not enslaved  in any way. It is true they are restricted for their own good by those  more capable of judging than they. That must always be the case.\"    \"I don't know about must,\" he sighed, \"but I am sure it will always be  the case as long as a man's idea of freedom is his ability to impose  some slavish notion on his brother.\"    \"Good-bye,\" I said, with a recurrence to my smirk of pharisaical pity,  \"I am sorry to see you here.\"    \"Oh, don't be troubled on my account,\" he answered; \"on the whole, I am  satisfied.\"    \"Satisfied! Impossible!\" I cried.    \"Why impossible? Consider that I shall never again be compelled to  associate with decent, honest folk. Oh, I have cause to be satisfied; I  am here on a life sentence.\"          THE OLD AND THE NEW DRAMA.    By MAX BAGINSKI.      The inscription over the Drama in olden times used to be, \"Man, look  into this mirror of life; your soul will be gripped in its innermost  depths, anguish and dread will take possession of you in the face of  this rage of human desire and passion. Go ye, atone and make good.\"    Even Schiller entertained this view when he called the Stage a moral  institution. It was also from this standpoint that the Drama was  expected to show the terrible consequences of uncontrolled human  passion, and that these consequences should teach man to overcome  himself. \"To conquer oneself is man's greatest triumph.\"    This ascetic tendency, incidentally part of chastisement and acquired  resignation, one can trace in every investigation of the value and  meaning of the Drama, though in different forms. The avenging Nemesis,  always at the heels of the sinner, may be placated by means of rigid  self-control and self-denial. This, too, was Schopenhauer's idea of the  Drama. In it, his eye perceived with horror that human relation became  disastrously interwoven; that guilt and atonement made light of the  human race, which merely served as a target for the principles of good  and evil. Guilt and atonement reign because the blind force of life will  not resign itself, but, on the contrary, is ever ready to yield itself  to the struggle of the passions. Mountains of guilt pile themselves on  the top of each other, while purifying fires ever flame up into the  heavens.    In the idea that Life in itself is a great guilt, Schopenhauer coincides  with the teachings of Christ, though otherwise he has little regard for  them. With Christ, he recognized in the chastisement of the body a  purification of the mind; the inner man, who thus escapes from close  physical intimacy, as if from bad company. The spiritual man appears  before the physical as a saint and a Pharisee. In reality, he is the  intellectual cause of the so-called bad deeds of the human body, its  path indicator and teacher. But, once the mischief is accomplished, he  puts on a pious air and denies all responsibility for the deed.  Wherever the idea of guilt, the fear of sin prevails, the mind becomes  traitor to the body: \"I know him not and will have nothing to do with  him.\" Whenever man entertains the belief in good and evil, he is bound  to pretend the good and do the evil. And yet the understanding of all  human occurrences begins, as with the Zarathustra philosopher, beyond  good and evil.    The modern drama is, in its profoundest depths, an attempt to ignore  good and evil in its analysis of human manifestations. It aims to get at  a complete whole, out of each strong, healthy emotion, out of each  absorbing mood that carries and urges one forward from the beginning to  the end. It represents the World as it reflects itself in each passion,  in each quivering life; not trying to confine and to judge, to condemn  or to praise; not acting merely in the capacity of a cold observer; but  striving to grow in oneness with Life; to become color, tone and light;  to absorb universal sorrow as one's own; universal joy as one's own; to  feel every emotion as it manifests itself in a natural way; to be one's  self, yet oblivious of self.    The modern dramatist tries to understand and to explain. Goodness is no  longer entitled to a reward, like a pupil who knows his lesson; nor is  evil condemned to an eternal Hell. Both belong together in the sphere of  all that is human. Often enough it is seen that evil triumphs over good,  while virtue, ever highly praised in words, is rarely practiced. It is  set aside to become dusty and dirty in some obscure corner. Only at some  opportune moment is it brought forward from its hiding place to serve as  a cover for some vile deed. We can no longer believe that beyond and  above us there is some irrevocable, irresistible Fate, whose duty it is  to punish all evil and wrong and to reward all goodness; an idea so  fondly cherished by our grandfathers.    To-day we no longer look for the force of fate outside of human  activity. It lives and weaves its own tragedies and comedies with us and  within us. It has its roots in our social, political and economic  surroundings, in our physical, mental and psychic capacities. (Did not  the fate of Cyrano de Bergerac lie in his gigantic nose?) With others,  fate lies in their vocation in life, in their mental and emotional  tendencies, which either submerge them into the hurry and rush of a  commonplace existence, or bring them into the most annoying conflicts  with the _dicta_ of society. Indeed, it is often seen that a human  being, apparently of a cheerful nature, but who has failed to establish  a durable relation with society, often leads a most tragic inner life.  Should he find the cause in his own inclinations, and suffer agonizing  reproaches therefrom, he becomes a misanthrope.

She seemed then to be living with a  tinsmith, and her colour was a gingery white.    I hope I am too much of a gentleman to taunt any lady in misfortune, but  I couldn't help saying--    \"Why don't you wear any of your beautiful coloured dresses now?\"    She answered me curtly, for she saw that she had ceased to charm.    \"I gave up wearing my pretty dresses,\" she said, \"because silly people  asked me so many questions about them.\"    As usual, I accepted her explanations in silence; but, when I see the  poodle opposite, in his varying glories of blue, and green, and orange,  and purple, I can't help thinking that perhaps my fair Bessie did not  always speak the truth.        The Vain Setter      OURS is one of the most ancient and noble families in the land, and I  contend that family pride is an exalted sentiment. I still hold to this  belief, in spite of all the sufferings that it has brought upon me.    My father, whose ancestor came over with the Conqueror, has taken prizes  at many a county show; and my mother, the handsomest of her sex, took  one prize, and would have taken more, but for the unfortunate accident  of having her tail cut off in a door.    I early determined to be worthy of my high breeding and undoubted  descent. A setter should have long, silky ears. I made my brother pull  mine gently for an hour at a time. In order to lengthen them, I combed  their fringes with my paws.    My father's brow is lofty and narrow. The unfortunate accident which  removed my mother from public life, suggested to me a way of cultivating  our most famous family characteristic. I used to place my head between  the doorpost and the door, while my brother leaned gently against the  latter, so as to press my skull to the requisite shape. My legs, I knew,  ought to be straight. I never indulged in any of those field-sports, to  which my brother early turned a light-hearted attention; for I knew  that undue exercise tends to curve the legs.    My tail was my special care. Regardless of comfort, I twisted myself  into the shape of a capital O, and, holding the end of my tail gently,  but firmly, in my teeth, I stretched myself and it.    So much pains devoted to such a noble object could not be thrown away. I  became the handsomest setter in the three counties.    My brother, in the meantime, grew expert in the coarse sporting  exercises to which he devoted his energies. He had no pride. He tramped  the mud of the fields; he tore his ears in bramble bushes; and I have  seen him so far lose all sense of our family's dignity as to grovel at  the feet of his master, and raise one of his paws, to indicate that  birds were near--common birds; I believe they are called partridges.    \"You might as well,\" I said to him bitterly--\"you might as well have  been born a pointer.\"    \"Why not?\" he said. \"I know a pointer,\" he went on, laughing in his  merry, careless way--\"I know a pointer who lives at the Pines Farm. A  capital fellow he is.\"    \"My dear boy,\" I said, \"just come and squeeze my head in the door a  little, will you? and let me tell you that for one of our family to  associate with a pointer is social ruin--common, coarse, smooth-coated  persons, related, I should suppose, to the vulgar plum-pudding dog.\"    My brother only laughed; but he was a good-natured fellow, and pinched  my head in the door until my forehead could stand the strain no longer.    I was sent to the Crystal Palace Dog Show; and, as I looked round on the  hundreds of dogs of all families and nationalities, I breathed a sigh  of contentment, and blessed the fate that had made me, in this England  of ours, a well-born English setter. My brother was not at the Show, of  course; but I think even he would have admired me if he could have seen  how far superior I was to all about me. Of course, I took the first  prize. My mission was fulfilled: my family pride was satisfied. The  judges unanimously pronounced me to be the most perfect and beautiful  sporting dog in the whole Show. My master, wild with delight, patted my  silky forehead, and then turned aside to talk with a stout gentleman in  gaiters.    I thought of what my life would be--one long, joyous round of shows,  applause, pats on the head from a grateful master, delicious food and  first prizes.    But my master's base nature--his ancestors came over with George and  the Hanoverians--struck all my hopes to the ground. I woke from my  dream of triumph to find myself sold to the stout man in gaiters.    I never saw my brother again. I was never able to tell my fond and  doting mother that I, like her, had taken a prize. I was never able to  chat with my father over a bone, comparing with him experiences of the  show bench. The stout, gaitered man took me away into a far country.    The next morning he took me out into the fields, and looked at me from  time to time, as if he expected me to do something. Unwilling to  disappoint him, I sat down and began my usual exercise for lengthening  my tail. He at once struck me violently. We went a little farther, and I  noticed that he looked more and more displeased; but I could not imagine  what it could be that so distressed him. Presently one of those common  partridge birds had the impertinence to fly out close to me. I caught it  at once, and looked round for applause. There only came another shower  of blows.    \"What's the good of your taking prizes,\" he said, \"if you're such an  idiot in the field?--might as well have a greyhound.\"    \"I wish you had,\" I said under my breath.    I spent a week in torment, and then it occurred to me that this  low-born, gaitered person would have been better pleased with my  brother. So I tried to recall the tricks with which my brother had  particularly aggravated me; and, the next time I smelt a partridge, I  lay down, as I had seen my brother do, and lifted a foolish foot. I was  rewarded with a pat and encouragement.    I have now sunk entirely to my brother's level. My master pronounces me  to be a most excellent sporting dog. But I shall never forget the blows  and angry words that were necessary to make me renounce my ideal of what  a setter should be; and deep in my heart I still cherish, with  passionate devotion, my views on duty, and my honourable family pride.
