(She had put bread into her  doublet, thinking to succour some half-starved wretch.)    \"It is my business, my boy, to be severe,\" he said, frowning. He was  sorely tried, for his heart was kind and yet he dared not show pity.  But she pleaded and pleaded, and finally Rocco nervously agreed.    \"Well, well, give it, boy. Give it. He will never taste food again,\"  and again the prisoner thanked Fidelio through the darkness of his  cell. When he spoke she felt a strange presentiment. Suppose this  should be the beloved husband whom she sought!    \"Oh, gentle youth! That I might repay this humane deed!\" the prisoner  murmured, too weak to speak loudly.    \"That voice--it is strange to me, yet--it is like some remembered  voice,\" Fidelio said to herself, and she clasped her hands upon her  heart, because it seemed to beat so loudly that Rocco might hear it.  While she wavered between hope and fear, Don Pizarro entered the  dungeon. He had come at last for his revenge.    \"Now, thou dog,\" he said to the prisoner, \"prepare to die. But before  you die, you are to know to whom you owe the deed.\" At that he threw  off his cloak and showed himself to be Pizarro.    \"It is Pizarro whom thou hast insulted. It is he who shall kill thee.\"    \"Do not think I fear a murderer,\" Florestan replied, with what heroism  his weakness would permit. At that Pizarro made a lunge at him with  the knife, but Fidelio threw herself in front of him, suddenly  recognizing him as he spoke to Pizarro.    \"Thou shalt not kill him, unless thou kill his wife as well,\" she  screamed. Rocco, Florestan and Pizarro all cried out in amazement.    \"Wife!\" Florestan clasped her weakly to his heart. Pizarro rushed at  Fidelio, becoming frantic with rage. He hurled her away and shouted:    \"No woman shall frighten me! Away with ye! The man shall die.\"  Instantly, Fidelio drew a pistol and pointed it at the murderer.    \"If he is to die, you shall die also,\" she cried, whereupon Rocco  shouted in fright, since it was a dreadful thing to try conclusions  with the governor of the prison. Pizarro himself drew back with fear.    Then a fanfare of trumpets was heard, announcing the arrival of  Fernando, the Minister.    \"Hark!\" Pizarro cried. \"I am undone! It is Fernando!\" The assassin  began to tremble. But Florestan and Fidelio knew that liberty was  near. One word of the truth to the Minister, one word that should tell  him of the governor's awful cruelty for a personal revenge, would set  Florestan free and bring punishment to Pizarro. Then Jaquino hurried  in:    \"Come, come, quick! The Minister and his suite are at the gates.\"    \"Thank God,\" said the kind-hearted jailer, under his breath. \"The man  is surely saved now. We're coming, my lad, we're coming,\" he answered.  \"Let the men come down and bear torches before Don Pizarro. He cannot  find his way out.\" Rocco's voice was trembling with gladness,  Florestan was almost fainting with weakness because of the sudden joy  that had come to him. Fidelio was praying to heaven in gratitude,  while Don Pizarro was horrified at the thought of what his punishment  would be.    The jailer and Don Pizarro ascended, and soon Fernando ordered all the  prisoners of the fortress brought before him. He had come to  investigate the doings of the governor who had long been known as a  great tyrant. When the unhappy men, who had been abused by starving  and confinement in underground cells, stood before him, the Minister's  heart was sorely touched, and Don Pizarro was more and more afraid.  Presently, Rocco fearlessly brought Fidelio and Don Florestan in front  of Fernando.    \"Oh, great Minister, I beg you to give ear to the wrongs of this sad  pair,\" he cried, and as Fernando looked at Florestan his eyes filled  with tears.    \"What, you? Florestan? My friend, whom I have so long believed was  dead? Thou who wert the friend of the oppressed, who tried to bring to  punishment this very wretch?\" he said, looking at Pizarro; and his  speech revealed why Pizarro had wanted to revenge himself upon the  unhappy noble.    \"Yes, yes, it is Don Florestan, my beloved husband,\" Fidelio answered,  while the good Rocco pushed her ahead of him, closer to Fernando's  side.    \"She is no youth, but the noblest woman in the world, Don Fernando,\"  Rocco cried, almost weeping in his agitation and relief at the turn  things were taking for those with whom he sympathized.    \"Just let me be heard,\" Pizarro called, becoming more and more  frightened each moment.    \"Enough of thee,\" Fernando answered, bitterly, in a tone that boded no  good to the wretch. Then Rocco told the whole truth about the  governor: how he, himself, had had to lend a hand to his wicked  schemes, because as a dependent he could not control matters; and then  all the prisoners cried out for Pizarro's punishment.    Fernando commanded Pizarro to give Fidelio the key of the prison, that  she, the faithful wife, should have the joy of unlocking the doors and  giving her husband his freedom. All the other prisoners and Fernando's  suite, the jailer, his daughter, Marcelline, and Jaquino rejoiced and  sang rapturously of Fernando's goodness. Pizarro was left, still  uncertain of his punishment, but all hoped that he would be made to  take Florestan's place in the dungeon and meet the fate he had  prepared for the much abused noble.          BERLIOZ      \"The Damnation of Faust\" was first produced as an opera, by Raoul  Gunsburg, in Monte Carlo, about 1903. Before that time it had been  conducted only as a concerted piece. Later it was produced in Paris,  Calve and Alvarez singing the great roles. That was in the late spring  of 1903.    In Europe the opera was produced with the dream scene (the  dream-Marguerite) as in the original plan of Berlioz, but in this  country this dream-Marguerite was omitted, also the rain in the ride  to Hell; otherwise the European and the New York production were much  the same. At the Metropolitan Opera House, in New York, there were  three hundred people upon the stage in the first act, and every  attention was given to scenic detail. This piece is meant for the  concert room, and in no sense for the operatic stage, but great care  and much money have been spent in trying to realize its scenic  demands. As a dramatic production, it cannot compare with the \"Faust\"  of Gounod, but it has certain qualities of a greater sort, which have  made impresarios desire to shape it for the stage.    Berlioz was probably one of the least attractive of musicians. As a  man, he was entirely detestable. He despised (from jealous rather than  critical motives) all music that was not his own; or if he chose to  applaud, his applause was certain to be for some obscure person  without ability, in order that there might be no unfavourable  comparisons drawn between his own work and that which he was praising.  Beyond doubt he was the greatest instrumentalist of Europe, but he was  _bizarre_, and none too lucid.    His method of showing his contempt for other great composers like  Beethoven, Mozart, and the like, was to conduct their music upon  important occasions, without having given himself or any one else a  rehearsal. He called Haydn a \"pedantic old baby,\" and refused as long  as he lived to hear Elijah (Mendelssohn). In short, he was one of the  vastly disagreeable people of the earth, who believe that their own  genius excuses everything.    The story of his behaviour at a performance of Cherubini's Ali Baba  will serve as an illustration of his bad taste.    Cherubini had become old, and was even more anxious about the fate of  his compositions than he had been in his youth, having less confidence  in himself as he declined in years, and on the occasion of Ali Baba he  was especially overwrought. Berlioz got a seat in the house, and made  his disapproval of the performance very marked by his manner. Finally  he cried out toward the end of the first act, \"Twenty francs for an  idea!\" During the second act he called, \"Forty francs for an idea!\"  and at the finale he screeched, \"Eighty francs for an idea!\" When all  was over, he rose wearily and said, loud enough to be heard all over  the place, \"I give it up--I'm not rich enough!\" and went out.    There is hardly an anecdote of Berlioz extant that does not deal with  his cynicism or displeasing qualities, therefore we may more or less  assume that they pretty correctly reflect the man. One of the stories  which well illustrates his love of \"showing up\" his fellows, concerns  his Fuite en Egypte. When it was produced he had put upon the  programme as the composer one Pierre Ducre \"of the seventeenth  century.\" The critics, one and all, wrote of the old and worthless  score that Berlioz had unearthed and foisted upon the suffering  public. Some of them wrote voluminously and knowingly of the life of  Pierre Ducre, and hinted at other productions of his, which they said  demonstrated his puerility. Then when he had roused all the discussion  he pleased, Berlioz came forward and announced that there never had  been any such personage as Ducre, and that it was himself who had  written Fuite en Egypte. He had made everybody appear as absurd as  possible, and there is no sign that he ever did that sort of thing for  the pure love of a joke. He was malicious, born so, lived so, and died  so. However great his music, he was unworthy of it.      DAMNATION OF FAUST    CHARACTERS OF THE OPERA    Faust.  Mephistopheles.  Brander.  Marguerite.  Sylphs, students, soldiers, angels.    Composer: Hector Berlioz.      ACT I    One lovely morning, in a Hungarian meadow, a scholar went to walk  before he should begin his day's task of study and of teaching. He was  an old man, who had thought of little in life, so far as his  associates knew, besides his books; but secretly he had longed for  the bright joys of the world most ardently.    While he lingered in the meadow, possessed with its morning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication — Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"or species which, after having been crossed at some former period with a  distinct form, and having since lost all traces of the cross, nevertheless  occasionally yield an individual which reverts (as in the case of the great-  great-grandchild of the pointer Sappho) to the crossing form. The most simple  case of reversion, namely, of a hybrid or mongrel to its grandparents, is  connected by an almost perfect series with the extreme case of a purely-bred  race recovering characters which had been lost during many ages; and we are  thus led to infer that all the cases must be related by some common bond.    Gartner believed that only highly sterile hybrid plants exhibit any tendency  to reversion to their parent-forms. This erroneous belief may perhaps be  accounted for by the nature of the genera crossed by him, for he admits that  the tendency differs in different genera. The statement is also directly  contradicted by Naudin's observations, and by the notorious fact that  perfectly fertile mongrels exhibit the tendency in a high degree,--even in a  higher degree, according to Gartner himself, than hybrids. (13/51.  'Bastarderzeugung' s. 582, 438, etc.)    Gartner further states that reversions rarely occur with hybrid plants raised  from species which have not been cultivated, whilst, with those which have  been long cultivated, they are of frequent occurrence. This conclusion  explains a curious discrepancy: Max Wichura (13/52. 'Die Bastardbefruchtung...  der Weiden' 1865 s. 23. For Gartner's remarks on this head, see  'Bastarderzeugung' s. 474, 582.) who worked exclusively on willows which had  not been subjected to culture, never saw an instance of reversion; and he goes  so far as to suspect that the careful Gartner had not sufficiently protected  his hybrids from the pollen of the parent-species: Naudin, on the other hand,  who chiefly experimented on cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants,  insists more strenuously than any other author on the tendency to reversion in  all hybrids. The conclusion that the condition of the parent-species, as  affected by culture, is one of the proximate causes leading to reversion,  agrees well with the converse case of domesticated animals and cultivated  plants being liable to reversion when they become feral; for in both cases the  organisation or constitution must be disturbed, though in a very different  way. (13/53. Prof. Weismann in his very curious essay on the different forms  produced by the same species of butterfly at different seasons ('Saison-  Dimorphismus der Schmetterlinge' pages 27, 28), has come to a similar  conclusion, namely, that any cause which disturbs the organisation, such as  the exposure of the cocoons to heat or even to much shaking, gives a tendency  to reversion.)    Finally, we have seen that characters often reappear in purely-bred races  without our being able to assign any proximate cause; but when they become  feral this is either indirectly or directly induced by the change in their  conditions of life. With crossed breeds, the act of crossing in itself  certainly leads to the recovery of long-lost characters, as well as of those  derived from either parent-form. Changed conditions, consequent on  cultivation, and the relative position of buds, flowers, and seeds on the  plant, all apparently aid in giving this same tendency. Reversion may occur  either through seminal or bud generation, generally at birth, but sometimes  only with an advance of age. Segments or portions of the individual may alone  be thus affected. That a being should be born resembling in certain characters  an ancestor removed by two or three, and in some cases by hundreds or even  thousands of generations, is assuredly a wonderful fact. In these cases the  child is commonly said to inherit such characters directly from its  grandparent, or more remote ancestors. But this view is hardly conceivable.  If, however, we suppose that every character is derived exclusively from the  father or mother, but that many characters lie latent or dormant in both  parents during a long succession of generations, the foregoing facts are  intelligible. In what manner characters may be conceived to lie latent, will  be considered in a future chapter to which I have lately alluded.    LATENT CHARACTERS.    But I must explain what is meant by characters lying latent. The most obvious  illustration is afforded by secondary sexual characters. In every female all  the secondary male characters, and in every male all the secondary female  characters, apparently exist in a latent state, ready to be evolved under  certain conditions. It is well known that a large number of female birds, such  as fowls, various pheasants, partridges, peahens, ducks, etc., when old or  diseased, or when operated on, assume many or all of the secondary male  characters of their species. In the case of the hen-pheasant this has been  observed to occur far more frequently during certain years than during others.  (13/54. Yarrell 'Phil. Transact.' 1827 page 268; Dr. Hamilton in 'Proc.  Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page 23.) A duck ten years old has been known to assume  both the perfect winter and summer plumage of the drake. (13/55. 'Archiv.  Skand. Beitrage zur Naturgesch.' 8 s. 397-413.) Waterton (13/56. In his  'Essays on Nat. Hist.' 1838 Mr. Hewitt gives analogous cases with hen-  pheasants in 'Journal of Horticulture' July 12, 1864 page 37. Isidore Geoffroy  Saint-Hilaire in his 'Essais de Zoolog. Gen.' ('Suites a Buffon' 1842 pages  496-513), has collected such cases in ten different kinds of birds. It appears  that Aristotle was well aware of the change in mental disposition in old hens.  The case of the female deer acquiring horns is given at page 513.) gives a  curious case of a hen which had ceased laying, and had assumed the plumage,  voice, spurs, and warlike disposition of the cock; when opposed to an enemy  she would erect her hackles and show fight. Thus every character, even to the  instinct and manner of fighting, must have lain dormant in this hen as long as  her ovaria continued to act. The females of two kinds of deer, when old, have  been known to acquire horns; and, as Hunter has remarked, we see something of  an analogous nature in the human species.    On the other hand, with male animals, it is notorious that the secondary  sexual characters are more or less completely lost when they are subjected to  castration. Thus, if the operation be performed on a young cock, he never, as  Yarrell states, crows again; the comb, wattles, and spurs do not grow to their  full size, and the hackles assume an intermediate appearance between true  hackles and the feathers of the hen. Cases are recorded of confinement, which  often affects the reproductive system, causing analogous results. But  characters properly confined to the female are likewise acquired by the male;  the capon takes to sitting on eggs, and will bring up chickens; and what is  more curious, the utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the fowl  act in the same manner, \"their delight being to watch when the hens leave  their nests, and to take on themselves the office of a sitter.\" (13/57.  'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 379.) That admirable observer Reaumur (13/58.  'Art de faire Eclore' etc. 1749 tome 2 page 8.) asserts that a cock, by being  long confined in solitude and darkness, can be taught to take charge of young  chickens; he then utters a peculiar cry, and retains during his whole life  this newly acquired maternal instinct. The many well-ascertained cases of  various male mammals giving milk shows that their rudimentary mammary glands  retain this capacity in a latent condition.    We thus see that in many, probably in all cases, the secondary characters of  each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex, ready to be evolved under  peculiar circumstances. We can thus understand how, for instance, it is  possible for a good milking cow to transmit her good qualities through her  male offspring to future generations; for we may confidently believe that  these qualities are present, though latent, in the males of each generation.  So it is with the game-cock, who can transmit his superiority in courage and  vigour through his female to his male offspring; and with man it is known  (13/59. Sir H. Holland 'Medical Notes and Reflections' 3rd edition 1855 page  31.) that diseases, such as hydrocele, necessarily confined to the male sex,  can be transmitted through the female to the grandson. Such cases as these  offer, as was remarked at the commencement of this chapter, the simplest  possible examples of reversion; and they are intelligible on the belief that  characters common to the grandparent and grandchild of the same sex are  present, though latent, in the intermediate parent of the opposite sex.    The subject of latent characters is so important, as we shall see in a future  chapter, that I will give another illustration. Many animals have the right  and left sides of their body unequally developed: this is well known to be the  case with flat-fish, in which the one side differs in thickness and colour and  in the shape of the fins, from the other, and during the growth of the young  fish one eye is gradually twisted from the lower to the upper surface. (13/60.  See Steenstrup on the 'Obliquity of Flounders' in Annals and Mag. of Nat.  Hist.' May 1865 page 361. I have given an abstract of Malm's explanation of  this wonderful phenomenon in the 'Origin of Species' 6th Edition page 186.) In  most flat-fishes the left is the blind side, but in some it is the right;  though in both cases reversed or \"wrong fishes,\" are occasionally developed;  and in Platessa flesus the right or left side is indifferently the upper one.  With gasteropods or shell-fish, the right and left sides are extremely unlike;  the far greater number of species are dextral, with rare and occasional  reversals of development; and some few"]]]
