It is something in itself holy, and is its own  reason for being. I ask all mothers, all real mothers, when their child  comes to them, with eyes brimming with childlike love and affection,  against which all else counts for naught, I ask them do they think  whether that child is legitimate or what is called an illegitimate  child? No! the joy of motherhood completely fills the heart, there is no  room for other feelings, and truly the answer comes, Nature does not  discriminate between the legitimate and illegitimate mothers, any more  than she labels the children brought into the world as such. And this  alone is the foundation to which we must hold fast. Nature acknowledges  motherhood only, wisely providing for its needs. Not so marriage, which  is a form men have given their sex relations, and established from the  standpoint of social and economic exigencies and considerations, it is  consequently subject to limitations and changes. Motherhood is an  eternal force lying at the root of life, not subjected to time or  change.    [Illustration]          OBJECT LESSON FOR ADVOCATES OF GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL.    By ARTHUR G. EVERETT, N--M.      THE best literary efforts possible have been exhausted in a vain effort  to convey to those fortunately not in San Francisco on the morning of  April 18, 1906, what terrible things resulted from the earthquake and  the fire which left that city a complete ruin; likewise has the kodak  and the camera--though busy at work while the flames roared around the  operator driving him, from one vantage point to another, before its  resistless power--failed to depict in its entirety the horrors, the  tragedies that followed in the wake of the crumbling walls, the  crackling flames that licked up alike palatial mansions and the squalid  homes of the poor, not content to feast upon the products of the forests  of California and the Eastern States alone, but, with the strategy of a  warrior, surrounded and penned within four walls hundreds of human  beings, stalwart men, delicate women, and babes at the breast, who were  then slowly roasted to death upon the funeral pyre of San Francisco.    Upon the minds and hearts of the survivors, alone, who walked between  the walls of fire those days, who escaped the frightful holocaust but by  a miracle while loved ones perished before their eyes, are written, are  recorded, too complete, too vivid, those terrible scenes, and fain would  they efface from their mind's negative those pictures of horrors which  now turn their dreams of the night into such a frightful nightmare that  they dread to close their eyes in slumber.    While the horrors of the earthquake and fire were so terrible, yet there  was something far worse, for the earthquake and fire were beyond human  control, but the still worse acts of the soldiers into whose hands the  control of the city were delegated could have been restrained by the  authorities had they so chosen; now that the world is being made aware  of the fact that the soldiers ruthlessly shot down men and women--yes,  women as well as men; in one case a woman was shot down by a soldier  because she dared to light a match to see where to lay her little sick  baby down--and that without any justification other than the order of  their superiors who likewise were so ordered by the authorities--a  natural result of governmental control--hence they are doing all they  can to controvert the facts regarding the brutal murders and worse of  the soldiers. In one case they went so far as to threaten the  confiscation of a printery if the editor did not call in and suppress an  issue in which was printed an article by a marine telling of seeing the  soldiers shoot down the inmates of a hotel so surrounded by fire it  seemed they else must be burned up--the excuse the soldiers gave for  shooting them--and so the soldiers shot them down to save (?) them. The  marine in this article did not tell how many of those thus shot down by  the soldiers were only wounded and writhed in agony on the increasing  heated floor until the fiery fiend ended their misery from the gun shot  wounds.    Brevity precludes going into details of what is already a matter of  history; of the soldiers shooting the inmates of an improvised hospital  that were unable to be moved when the fire surrounded the building; of  the soldiers shooting an old man for refusing to work, though so infirm  with age that he had to walk with a cane; of the shooting of a Red Cross  man while in his auto on a deed of mercy bent; of the man shot in the  back for talking back to a soldier, and that after he had turned away  from the drunken brute; of the shooting of a man for having whisky in  his possession and refusing to give it up--that the soldiers had plenty  is in evidence from the fact that a large per cent. were so drunk that  they could walk with but difficulty--of their insulting women, and even  far worse than mere insult also; of shooting persons for looting while  they themselves did the same; all this and much more and worse are known  to be true, and, in the language of another writer on this same subject,  \"Strive as they may the authorities will never be able to whitewash the  military abominations inflicted upon San Francisco and vicinity.\" In  this regard the same writer says most truly:           \"The rulers of the State furnished us an example of 'anarchy,'       according to their own definition of the term.\"      In times like these it brings out what is in the man, and these murders  and lesser brutalities of the soldiers while policing San Francisco tell  us that the soldier is but an infuriated thug, ready to do murder and  rapine at the first opportunity; the civic authorities of Oakland  recognized this as a fact when they finally allowed the reopening of the  saloons, for the barkeepers were specially interdicted from selling or  giving liquor to soldiers; they were already loaded too heavy with  murderous instincts and propensities and it would not do to run the risk  of touching off that magazine of murder with the match of whisky.    These brutal butcheries and rapine by the soldiers while thus in control  of San Francisco are the legitimate fruits of governmental control, and  it would be well for those who are so strenuously advocating  militarism--the true name for Governmental Control--to bear these things  in mind, for such horrors would be the daily menu under such system, for  there is lots of the savage in the most of us and it needs but to put a  gun in the hands of some and decorate them with brass buttons with U. S.  inscribed thereon to bring to the surface--like a plaster on a boil--all  the native savagery there is in the man; personally, I would prefer to  run my chances among the Head Hunters on the Isle of Borneo than among  uniformed thugs protected and encouraged by martial law to carry out  their natural murderous propensities as was the case in San Francisco,  following the earthquake on the morning of April 18, 1906.          THE GENIUS OF WAR    By JOHN FRANCIS VALTER.           _I am the Genius of War.       My standard's the Skull and the Bones.       I raise my voice--I stamp my foot,       And legions rise out of the ground._         _Armies advance and retreat,       Poisoned, diseased and maimed:       All that is left is a grewsome aspect       To the moonlight, the ghouls and Me._         _All this to a laudable end:--       The general has his star;       Shylock his four per cent;       The contractor's wife a costly gem       To enhance her vulgar charms;       The mother a harvest of tears;       The wife a broken heart;       The unborn babe a prenatal curse;       While I have my surfeit of blood_.      [Illustration]          DIGNITY SPEAKS.      \"Hark ye, millions, and tremble! I am more powerful than the Law.  Together with my sister, Respectability, I reach far beyond the boundary  of the authority of governments. I am supreme.    Behold the miserable criminal, desperately resisting the brutal  treatment of the police officer. I shall force him to his knees. I shall  subdue him. Enthroned upon the seat of Justice, robed in the solemn  black of my sacred office, I shall break the rebel's spirit.    'Tis in this that the highest refinement of tyranny manifests itself--it  enters into the very innermost depths of the human mind and there it  ravages, till its foul breath has withered the last resistance of the  unfortunate soul, and the consciousness of self is destroyed; this  accomplished, the man himself is dead.    The Law! See how the timid masses cower at the mere mention of my name.  See them tremble as I enter the arena of the Legislature.    The Dignity of the Law!    The Majesty of the Law!    It must forever remain my great secret that the Law is the Cerberus that  guards the portals of our earthly paradise against the common herd--we  must not be disturbed in our orgies.    The Law! 'Tis our beastly greediness, our bloodthirsty rapacity  expressed in statutes. 'Tis the insatiety of the human beasts of prey  immortalized in jurisprudence, and I, Dignity, sanctify all that.    As a captain of industry, as a prince of commerce, or as a king of  finance, I speak with solemn face of the heavy responsibilities that  rest upon those to whose care God, in his infinite wisdom, has entrusted  the wealth of the universe; I speak with zeal of the sacred duty of the  rich to lend a helping hand to our less fortunate brothers; I never tire  to emphasize the necessity of wise stewardship.    In the meantime, I exploit the \"poor brothers\" and I appropriate the  lion's share of the fruit of his labor; he is made to pay me an usurious  profit on my investments.

Internet country code:  This entry includes the two-letter codes  maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers  Authority (IANA) to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).    Internet hosts:  This entry lists the number of Internet hosts  available within a country. An Internet host is a computer connected  directly to the Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP)  computer is a host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired  terminal, at an institution with a mainframe computer connected  directly to the Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via  telephone line, cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's  host computer. The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of  Internet connectivity.    Internet users:  This entry gives the number of users within a country  that access the Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and  may include users who access the Internet at least several times a week  to those who access it only once within a period of several months.    Introduction:  This category includes one entry, Background.    Investment (gross fixed):  This entry records total business spending  on fixed assets, such as factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings,  and inventories of raw materials, which provide the basis for future  production. It is measured gross of the depreciation of the assets,  i.e., it includes invesment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped  capital.    Irrigated land:  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of  land area that is artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch:  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest  court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.    Labor force:  This entry contains the total labor force figure.    Labor force - by occupation:  This entry lists the percentage  distribution of the labor force by occupation. The distribution will  total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete.    Land boundaries:  This entry contains the total length of all land  boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border  countries. When available, official lengths published by national  statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ,  country border lengths reported by contiguous countries may differ.    Land use:  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area  for three different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated  for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each  harvest; permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus,  coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes  land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but  excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land  not arable or under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and  pastures, forests and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land,  etc.    Languages:  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting  with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population  speaking that language.    Legal system:  This entry contains a brief description of the legal  system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of  International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.    Legislative branch:  This entry contains information on the structure  (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and  term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or  accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next  election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number  of seats held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth:  This entry contains the average number of  years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if  mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry  includes total population as well as the male and female components.  Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life  in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be  thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human  capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial  measures.    Literacy:  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census  Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There  are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless  otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition  - the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the  standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read  and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy,  while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the  most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low  levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic  development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-  driven world.    Location:  This entry identifies the country's regional location,  neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Major infectious diseases:  This entry lists major infectious diseases  likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases  is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These  infectious diseases represent risks to US government personnel  traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three  years. The degree of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature  of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of  being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not  necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local  population.  The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific  location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations,  time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine  physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend  appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.  Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown  in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note - The  sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries  may vary according to local conditions.    food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the  local economy:    Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the  liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with  fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit  fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged  symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.    Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the  functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal  contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,  abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.    Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or  water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained  high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.    vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected  arthropod:    Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;  transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;  parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in  cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to  damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;  endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the  majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-  Saharan Africa.    Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe  headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death  in 5% of cases.    Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from  influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;  occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where  most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.    Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral  disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can  progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.    African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma;  transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies;  infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases  when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death;  endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals  act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.    Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania;  transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin  lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases  occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild  and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of  infection.    Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated  with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent  plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America  associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as  fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses  rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a  death rate in excess of 50%.    Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - "]]]
