I put it down to too much  Beethoven.\"        Chapter IV: Fourth Chapter    Mr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after  music. She had not really appreciated the clergyman's wit, nor the  suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she  wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on  the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she might not attempt.  It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike? Charlotte  had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were inferior  to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to inspire  others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves. Indirectly, by  means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much. But  if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then  despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been written to illustrate this  point.    There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have  gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst. She  reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early  Victorian song. It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business,  sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well. But alas!  the creature grows degenerate. In her heart also there are springing  up strange desires. She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast  panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She has marked the kingdom  of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war--a radiant  crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding  heavens. Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over  the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy,  not because they are masculine, but because they are alive. Before the  show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal  Woman, and go there as her transitory self.    Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to  which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious. Nor has  she any system of revolt. Here and there a restriction annoyed her  particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she  had done so. This afternoon she was peculiarly restive. She would really  like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved. As she might  not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari's shop.    There she bought a photograph of Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus.\" Venus,  being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss  Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it. (A pity in art of course  signified the nude.) Giorgione's \"Tempesta,\" the \"Idolino,\" some of  the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She felt  a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico's \"Coronation,\" Giotto's  \"Ascension of St. John,\" some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido  Reni Madonnas. For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical  approval to every well-known name.    But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed  still unopened. She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her  to be conscious of it. \"The world,\" she thought, \"is certainly full  of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.\" It was not  surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it  always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.    \"Nothing ever happens to me,\" she reflected, as she entered the Piazza  Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to  her. The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to  strike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,  half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who  idled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of  a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth  upon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of  unreality--the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older  person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient  was happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more.    She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose  out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed  no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable  treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her,  still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and  started towards home.    Then something did happen.    Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. \"Cinque  lire,\" they had cried, \"cinque lire!\" They sparred at each other, and  one of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He frowned; he bent towards  Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.  He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between  them and trickled down his unshaven chin.    That was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary  man from her, and bore him away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson  happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where  the man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she caught  sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,  fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.    She thought: \"Oh, what have I done?\"    \"Oh, what have I done?\" she murmured, and opened her eyes.    George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. She had  complained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held  her in his arms.    They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He must have  carried her. He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees. She  repeated:    \"Oh, what have I done?\"    \"You fainted.\"    \"I--I am very sorry.\"    \"How are you now?\"    \"Perfectly well--absolutely well.\" And she began to nod and smile.    \"Then let us come home. There's no point in our stopping.\"    He held out his hand to pull her up. She pretended not to see it. The  cries from the fountain--they had never ceased--rang emptily. The whole  world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.    \"How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now  I am well. I can go alone, thank you.\"    His hand was still extended.    \"Oh, my photographs!\" she exclaimed suddenly.    \"What photographs?\"    \"I bought some photographs at Alinari's. I must have dropped them out  there in the square.\" She looked at him cautiously. \"Would you add to  your kindness by fetching them?\"    He added to his kindness. As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose  with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.    \"Miss Honeychurch!\"    She stopped with her hand on her heart.    \"You sit still; you aren't fit to go home alone.\"    \"Yes, I am, thank you so very much.\"    \"No, you aren't. You'd go openly if you were.\"    \"But I had rather--\"    \"Then I don't fetch your photographs.\"    \"I had rather be alone.\"    He said imperiously: \"The man is dead--the man is probably dead; sit  down till you are rested.\" She was bewildered, and obeyed him. \"And  don't move till I come back.\"    In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in  dreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,  and joined itself to earth. How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he  returned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her,  \"Oh, what have I done?\"--the thought that she, as well as the dying man,  had crossed some spiritual boundary.    He returned, and she talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy  topic. She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous  over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. Being  strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. She rose  without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,  she walked firmly enough towards the Arno. There a cabman signalled to  them; they refused him.    \"And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say--how very odd Italians  are!--and gave himself up to the police! Mr. Beebe was saying that  Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish. When my  cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday--What was that?\"    He had thrown something into the stream.    \"What did you throw in?\"    \"Things I didn't want,\" he said crossly.    \"Mr. Emerson!\"    \"Well?\"    \"Where are the photographs?\"    He was silent.    \"I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.\"    \"I didn't know what to do with them,\" he cried, and his voice was that  of an anxious boy. Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.  \"They were covered with blood. There! I'm glad I've told you; and all  the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with  them.\" He pointed down-stream. \"They've gone.\" The river swirled under  the bridge, \"I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better  that they should go out to the sea--I don't know; I may just mean that  they frightened me.\" Then the boy verged into a man. \"For something  tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled. It  isn't exactly that a man has died.\"    Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.    \"It has happened,\" he repeated, \"and I mean to find out what it is.\"    \"Mr. Emerson--\"    He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#8)"],[1,"supposed them carried away. They have observed the misplaced eggs  disappear, and, without farther investigation, have asserted that the  bees convey them elsewhere: they take them, indeed, not to convey them  any where, but to devour them. Thus nature has not charged bees with the  care of placing the eggs in the cells appropriated for them, but she has  inspired females themselves with sufficient instinct to know the species  of eggs they are about to lay, and to deposit them in suitable cells.  This has already been observed by M. de Reaumur, and here my  observations correspond with his. Thus it is certain that in the natural  state, when fecundation takes place at the proper time, and the queen  has suffered from nothing, she is never deceived in the choice of the  cells where her eggs are to be deposited; she never fails to lay those  of workers in small cells, and those of males in large ones. The  distinction is important, for the same certainty of instinct is no  longer conspicuous in the conduct of those females whose impregnation  has been deferred. I was oftener than once deceived respecting the eggs  that such queens laid, for they were deposited indiscriminately in small  cells and those of drones; and not aware of their instinct having  suffered, I conceived that the eggs in small cells would produce  workers; therefore I was very much surprised, when, at the moment they  should have been hatched, the bees closed up the cells, and  demonstrated, by anticipation, that the included worms would change into  drones; they actually became males; those produced in small cells were  small, those in large cells large. Thus I must warn observers, who would  repeat my experiments on queens that lay only the eggs of males, not to  be deceived by these circumstances, and expect that eggs of males will  be deposited in the workers cells.    It is a singular fact, that the females, whose fecundation has been  retarded, sometimes lay the eggs of males in royal cells. I shall prove,  in the history of swarms, that immediately when queens, in the natural  state, begin their great laying of male eggs, the workers construct  numerous royal cells. Undoubtedly, there is some secret relation between  the appearance of male eggs and the construction of these cells; for it  is a law of nature from which bees never derogate. It is not surprising,  therefore, that such cells are constructed in hives governed by queens  laying the eggs of males only. It is no longer extraordinary that these  queens deposit in the royal cells, eggs of the only species they can  lay, for in general their instinct seems affected. But what I cannot  comprehend is, why the bees take exactly the same care of the male eggs  deposited in royal cells, as of those that should become queens. They  provide them more plentifully with food, they build up the cells as if  containing a royal worm; in a word, they labour with such regularity  that we have frequently been deceived. More than once, in the firm  persuasion of finding royal nymphs, we have opened the cells after they  were sealed, yet the nymph of a drone always appeared. Here the instinct  of the workers seemed defective. In the natural state, they can  accurately distinguish the male worms from those of common bees, as they  never fail giving a particular covering to the cells containing the  former. Why then can they no longer distinguish the worms of drones when  deposited in the royal cells? The fact deserves much attention. I am  convinced that to investigate the instinct of animals, we must  carefully observe where it appears to err.    Perhaps I should have begun this letter with an abstract of the  observations of prior naturalists, on queens laying none but the eggs of  males; however, I shall here repair the omission.    In a work, _Histoire de la Reine des Abeilles_, translated from the  German by _Blassiere_, there is printed a letter from M. Schirach to  you, dated 15 April 1771, where he speaks of some hives, in which the  whole brood changed into drones. You will remember that he ascribes this  circumstance to some unknown vice in the ovaries of the queen; but he  was far from suspecting that retarded fecundation had been the cause of  vitiation. He justly felicitated himself on discovering a method to  prevent the destruction of hives in this situation, which was simple,  for it consisted in removing the queen that laid the eggs of males only,  and substituting one for her whose ovaries were not impaired. But to  make the substitution effectual, it was necessary to procure queens at  pleasure; a secret reserved for M. Schirach, and of which I shall speak  in the following letter. You observe that the whole experiments of the  German naturalist tended to the preservation of the hives whose queens  laid none except male eggs; and that he did not attempt to discover the  cause of the vice evident in their ovaries.    M. de Reaumur also says a few words, somewhere, of a hive containing  many more drones than workers, but advances no conjectures on the cause.  However, he adds, as a remarkable circumstance, that the males were  tolerated in this hive until the subsequent spring. It is true that bees  governed by a queen laying only male eggs, or by a virgin queen,  preserve their drones several months after they have been massacred in  other hives. I can ascribe no reason for it, but it is a fact I have  several times witnessed during my long course of observations on  retarded impregnation. In general it has appeared that while the queen  lays male eggs, bees do not massacre the males already perfect in the  hive. PREGNY, _21. August 1791_.      FOOTNOTES:    {G} The experiments suggested in this paragraph, recall a singular  reflection of M. de Reaumur. Where treating of oviparous flies, he says,  it would not be impossible for a hen to produce a living chicken, if,  after fecundation, the eggs she should first lay could by any means be  retained twenty-one days in the oviducts. _Mem. sur. les Insect. tom. 4.  mem. 10._          LETTER IV.    _ON M. SCHIRACH'S DISCOVERY._      When you found it necessary, Sir, in the new edition of your works, to  give an account of M. Schirach's beautiful experiments on the conversion  of common worms into royal ones, you invited naturalists to repeat them.  Indeed such an important discovery required the confirmation of several  testimonies. For this reason, I hasten to inform you that all my  researches establish the reality of the discovery. During ten years  that I have studied bees, I have repeated M. Schirach's experiment so  often, and with such uniform success, that I can no longer have the  least doubt on the subject. Therefore, I consider it an established  fact, when bees lose their queen, and several workers' worms are  preserved in the hive, they enlarge some of their cells, and supply them  not only with a different kind of food, but a greater quantity of it,  and the worms reared in this manner, instead of changing to common bees,  become real queens. I request my readers to reflect on the explanation  you have given of so uncommon a fact, and the philosophical consequences  you have deduced from it. _Contemplation de la Nature, part. II, chap.  27._    In this letter I shall content myself with some account of the figure of  the royal cells constructed by bees around those worms that are destined  for the royal state, and terminate with discussing some points wherein  my observations differ from those of M. Schirach.    Bees soon become sensible of having lost their queen, and in a few hours  commence the labour necessary to repair their loss. First, they select  the young common worms, which the requisite treatment is to convert into  queens, and immediately begin with enlarging the cells where they are  deposited. Their mode of proceeding is curious; and the better to  illustrate it, I shall describe the labour bestowed on a single cell,  which will apply to all the rest, containing worms destined for queens.  Having chosen a worm, they sacrifice three of the contiguous cells:  next, they supply it with food, and raise a cylindrical inclosure  around, by which the cell becomes a perfect tube, with a rhomboidal  bottom; for the parts forming the bottom are left untouched. If the bees  damaged it, they would lay open three corresponding cells on the  opposite surface of the comb, and, consequently, destroy their worms,  which would be an unnecessary sacrifice, and Nature has opposed it.  Therefore, leaving the bottom rhomboidal, they are satisfied with  raising a cylindrical tube around the worm, which, like the other cells  in the comb, is horizontal. But this habitation remains suitable to the  worm called to the royal state only during the first three days of its  existence: another situation is requisite for the other two days it is a  worm. Then, which is so small a portion of its life, it must inhabit a  cell nearly of a pyramidal figure, and hanging perpendicularly; we may  say the workers know it; for, after the worm has completed the third  day, they prepare the place to be occupied by its new lodging. They gnaw  away the cells surrounding the cylindrical tube, mercilessly sacrifice  their worms, and use the wax in constructing a new pyramidal tube, which  they solder at right angles to the first, and work it downwards. The  diameter of this pyramid decreases insensibly from the base, which is  very wide, to the point. During the two days that it is inhabited by  the worm, a bee constantly keeps its head more or less inserted into the  cell, and, when this worker quits it, another comes to occupy its place.  In proportion as the worm grows, the bees labour in extending the cell,  and bring food, which they place before its mouth, and around its body,  forming a kind of cord around it. The worm, which can move only in a  spiral direction, turns incessantly to take the food before its head: it  insensibly descends,"]]]
