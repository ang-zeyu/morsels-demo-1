In the course of the centuries the development of the Midrash, or study  of the Law, lay along the two strongly marked lines of Halacha, the  explanation and formulating of laws, and Haggada, their poetical  illustration and ethical application. These are the two spheres within  which the intellectual life of Judaism revolved, and these the two  elements, the legal and the aesthetic, making up the Talmud.    The two Midrashic systems emphasize respectively the rule of law and the  sway of liberty: Halacha is law incarnate; Haggada, liberty regulated by  law and bearing the impress of morality. Halacha stands for the rigid  authority of the Law, for the absolute importance of theory--the law and  theory which the Haggada illustrates by public opinion and the dicta of  common-sense morality. The Halacha embraces the statutes enjoined by  oral tradition, which was the unwritten commentary of the ages on the  written Law, along with the discussions of the academies of Palestine  and Babylonia, resulting in the final formulating of the Halachic  ordinances. The Haggada, while also starting from the word of the Bible,  only plays with it, explaining it by sagas and legends, by tales and  poems, allegories, ethical reflections, and historical reminiscences.  For it, the Bible was not only the supreme law, from whose behests there  was no appeal, but also \"a golden nail upon which\" the Haggada \"hung its  gorgeous tapestries,\" so that the Bible word was the introduction,  refrain, text, and subject of the poetical glosses of the Talmud. It was  the province of the Halacha to build, upon the foundation of biblical  law, a legal superstructure capable of resisting the ravages of time,  and, unmindful of contemporaneous distress and hardship, to trace out,  for future generations, the extreme logical consequences of the Law in  its application. To the Haggada belonged the high, ethical mission of  consoling, edifying, exhorting, and teaching a nation suffering the  pangs, and threatened with the spiritual stagnation, of exile; of  proclaiming that the glories of the past prefigured a future of equal  brilliancy, and that the very wretchedness of the present was part of  the divine plan outlined in the Bible. If the simile is accurate that  likens the Halacha to the ramparts about Israel's sanctuary, which every  Jew was ready to defend with his last drop of blood, then the Haggada  must seem \"flowery mazes, of exotic colors and bewildering fragrance,\"  within the shelter of the Temple walls.    The complete work of expounding, developing, and finally establishing  the Law represents the labor of many generations, the method of  procedure varying from time to time. In the long interval between the  close of the Holy Canon and the completion of the Talmud can be  distinguished three historical strata deposited by three different  classes of teachers. The first set, the Scribes--_Soferim_--flourished  in the period beginning with the return from Babylonian captivity and  ending with the Syrian persecutions (220 B.C.E.), and their work was the  preservation of the text of the Holy Writings and the simple expounding  of biblical ordinances. They were followed by the  \"Learners\"--_Tanaim_--whose activity extended until 220 C.E. Great  historical events occurred in that period: the campaigns of the  Maccabean heroes, the birth of Jesus, the destruction of the Temple by  the Romans, the rebellion under Bar-Kochba, and the final complete  dispersion of the Jews. Amid all these storms the _Tanaim_ did not for a  moment relinquish their diligent research in the Law. The Talmud tells  the story of a celebrated rabbi, than which nothing can better  characterize the age and its scholars: Night was falling. A funeral  cortege was moving through the streets of old Jerusalem. It was said  that disciples were bearing a well-beloved teacher to the grave.  Reverentially the way was cleared, not even the Roman guard at the gate  hindered the procession. Beyond the city walls it halted, the bier was  set down, the lid of the coffin opened, and out of it arose the  venerable form of Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai, who, to reach the Roman  camp unmolested, had feigned death. He went before Vespasian, and,  impressed by the noble figure of the hoary rabbi, the general promised  him the fulfilment of any wish he might express. What was his petition?  Not for his nation, not for the preservation of the Holy City, not even  for the Temple. His request was simple: \"Permit me to open a school at  Jabneh.\" The proud Roman smilingly gave consent. He had no conception of  the significance of this prayer and of the prophetic wisdom of the  petitioner, who, standing on the ruins of his nation's independence,  thought only of rescuing the Law. Rome, the empire of the \"iron legs,\"  was doomed to be crushed, nation after nation to be swallowed in the  vortex of time, but Israel lives by the Law, the very law snatched from  the smouldering ruins of Jerusalem, the beloved alike of crazy zealots  and despairing peace advocates, and carried to the tiny seaport of  Jabneh. There Jochanan ben Zakkai opened his academy, the gathering  place of the dispersed of his disciples and his people, and thence,  gifted with a prophet's keen vision, he proclaimed Israel's mission to  be, not the offering of sacrifices, but the accomplishment of works of  peace.[14]    The _Tanaim_ may be considered the most original expounders of the  science of Judaism, which they fostered at their academies. In the  course of centuries their intellectual labor amassed an abundant store  of scientific material, together with so vast a number of injunctions,  prohibitions, and laws that it became almost impossible to master the  subject. The task of scholars now was to arrange the accumulation of  material and reduce it to a system. Rabbi after rabbi undertook the  task, but only the fourth attempt at codification, that made by Yehuda  the Prince, was successful. His compilation, classifying the  subject-matter under six heads, subdivided into sixty-three tractates,  containing five hundred and twenty-four chapters, was called Mishna, and  came to be the authority appealed to on points of law.    Having assumed fixity as a code, the Mishna in turn became what the  Bible had been for centuries--a text, the basis of all legal development  and scientific discussion. So it was used by the epigones, the  _Amoraim_, or Speakers, the expounders of the third period. For  generations commenting on the Mishna was the sum-total of literary  endeavor. Traditions unheeded before sprang to light. New methods  asserted themselves. To the older generation of Halachists succeeded a  set of men headed by Akiba ben Joseph, who, ignoring practical issues,  evolved laws from the Bible text or from traditions held to be divine. A  spiritual, truly religious conception of Judaism was supplanted by legal  quibbling and subtle methods of interpretation. Like the sophists of  Rome and Alexandria at that time, the most celebrated teachers in the  academies of Babylonia and Palestine for centuries gave themselves up to  casuistry. This is the history of the development of the Talmud, or more  correctly of the two Talmuds, the one, finished in 390 C. E., being the  expression of what was taught at the Palestinian academies; the other,  more important one, completed in 500 C. E., of what was taught in  Babylonia.    The Babylonian, the one regarded as authoritative, is about four times  as large as the Jerusalem Talmud. Its thirty-six treatises  (_Massichtoth_), in our present edition, cover upwards of three thousand  folio pages, bound in twelve huge volumes. To speak of a completed  Talmud is as incorrect as to speak of a biblical canon. No religious  body, no solemn resolution of a synod, ever declared either the Talmud  or the Bible a completed whole. Canonizing of any kind is distinctly  opposed to the spirit of Judaism. The fact is that the tide of  traditional lore has never ceased to flow.    We now have before us a faint outline sketch of the growth of the  Talmud. To portray the busy world fitting into this frame is another and  more difficult matter. A catalogue of its contents may be made. It may  be said that it is a book containing laws and discussions, philosophic,  theologic, and juridic dicta, historical notes and national  reminiscences, injunctions and prohibitions controlling all the  positions and relations of life, curious, quaint tales, ideal maxims and  proverbs, uplifting legends, charming lyrical outbursts, and attractive  enigmas side by side with misanthropic utterances, bewildering medical  prescriptions, superstitious practices, expressions of deep agony,  peculiar astrological charms, and rambling digressions on law,  zoology, and botany, and when all this has been said, not half its  contents have been told. It is a luxuriant jungle, which must be  explored by him who would gain an adequate idea of its features and  products.    The Ghemara, that is, the whole body of discussions recorded in the two  Talmuds, primarily forms a running commentary on the text of the Mishna.  At the same time, it is the arena for the debating and investigating of  subjects growing out of the Mishna, or suggested by a literature  developed along with the Talmudic literature. These discussions,  debates, and investigations are the opinions and arguments of the  different schools, holding opposite views, developed with rare acumen  and scholastic subtlety, and finally harmonized in the solution reached.  The one firm and impregnable rock supporting the gigantic structure of  the Talmud is the word of the Bible, held sacred and inviolable.

Swartboy here interrupted the conversation by announcing that he had  enough meat cooked for them to begin their meal with; and about ten  pounds' weight of buffalo veal cutlets were placed before the hunters  and their guest.    Macora, who, to all appearance, had been waiting very patiently while  the cutlets were being broiled, commenced the repast with some show of  self-restraint.  This, however, wholly forsook him before it was  finished.  He ate voraciously, consuming more than the four young  hunters together.  This, however, he did not do without making an  apology for his apparent greed; stating that he had been nearly two days  without having tasted food.    The supper having at length come to an end, all stretched themselves  around the fire and went to sleep.    The night passed without their being disturbed; and soon after sunrise  they arose,--not all at the same time,--for one of the party had risen  and taken his departure an hour earlier than the rest.  It was Macora,  whom they had entertained the evening before.    \"Here, you Swart and Cong!\" exclaimed Arend, when he discovered that the  chief was no longer in the camp, \"see if any of the horses are missing.  It is just possible we have been tricked by a false tale and robbed into  the bargain.\"    \"By whom?\" asked Groot Willem.    \"By your friend, the chief.  He has stolen himself away, if nothing  else.\"    \"I'll bet my life,\" exclaimed Willem, in a more positive tone than the  others had ever yet heard him use, \"that that man is an honest fellow,  and that all he has told us is true, though I can't account for his  absence.  He is a chief, and has the air of one.\"    \"Yes, he is a chief, no doubt,\" said Hendrik, sneeringly.  \"Every  African in this part of the world is a chief, if he only has a family.  Whether his story be true or not, it looks ugly, his leaving us in this  clandestine manner.\"    Hans, as usual, had nothing to say upon a subject of which he knew  nothing; and Swartboy, after making sure that no horses, guns, or other  property were missing, expressed the opinion that he was never so  mystified in his life.    Nothing was gone from the camp; and yet he was quite certain that any  one speaking a native African language understood by Congo, could not be  capable of acting honestly if an opportunity was allowed him for the  opposite.    Having allowed their horses an hour to graze, while they themselves  breakfasted upon buffalo veal, our adventurers broke up their bivouac,  and continued their march down the bank of the river.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    MACORA'S KRAAL.    After journeying about three hours, the young hunters came to a place  that gave unmistakable evidence of having been often visited by human  beings.    Small palm-trees had been cut down, the trunks taken away, and the tops  left on the ground.  Elephants, giraffes, or other animals that feed on  foliage would have taken the tops of the trees, and, moreover, would not  have cut them down with hatchets, the marks of which were visible in the  stumps left standing.  Half a mile farther on, and fields could be seen  in cultivation.  They were evidently approaching a place inhabited by a  people possessing some intelligence.    \"See!\" exclaimed Arend, as they rode on, \"there's a large body of men  coming towards us.\"    All turned to the direction in which Arend was gazing.  They saw about  fifty people coming along the crest of a ridge, that trended toward the  north.    \"Perhaps they mean mischief,\" said Hans.  \"What shall we do?\"    \"Ride on and meet them,\" exclaimed Hendrik.  \"If they are enemies it is  not our fault.  We have not molested them.\"    As the strangers came near, the hunters recognised their late guest, who  was now mounted on an ox and riding in advance of his party.  His  greeting, addressed to Groot Willem, was interpreted by Congo.    \"I have invited you to come to my kraal,\" said he, \"and to bring your  friends along with you.  I left you early this morning, and have been to  my home to see that preparations should be made worthy of those who have  befriended Macora.  Some of my people, the bravest and best amongst  them, are here to bid you welcome.\"    A procession was then formed, and all proceeded on to the African  village, which was but a short distance from the spot.  On entering it,  a group of about a hundred and fifty women received them with a chant,  expressed in low murmuring tones, not unlike the lullaby with which a  mother sings her child to sleep.    The houses of the kraal were constructed stockade fashion, in rows of  upright poles, interlaced with reeds or long grass, and then covered  with a plaster of mud.  Through these the hunters were conducted to a  long shed in the centre of the village, where the saddles were taken  from their horses, which were afterwards led off to the grazing ground.    Although Macora's subjects had been allowed but three hours' notice,  they had prepared a splendid feast for his visitors.    The young hunters sat down to a dinner of roast antelope, _biltongue_,  stews of hippopotamus and buffalo flesh, baked fish, ears of green maize  roasted, with wild honey, stewed pumpkin, melons, and plenty of good  milk.    The young hunters and all their following were waited on with the  greatest courtesy.  Even their dogs were feasted, while Swartboy and  Congo had never in all their lives been treated with so much  consideration.    In the afternoon, Macora informed his guests that he should give them an  entertainment; and, in order that they should enjoy the spectacle  intended for them, he informed them, by way of prologue, of the  circumstances under which it was to be enacted.    His statement was to the effect that his companions in the canoe, at the  time it was capsized by the hippopotamus, had reached home, bringing  with them the story of their mishap; that the tribe had afterwards made  a search for their chief, but not finding him, had come to the  conclusion that he had been either drowned or killed by the sea-cow.  They had given him up for lost; and another important member of the  community, named Sindo, had proclaimed himself chief of the tribe.    When Macora reached home that morning, Sindo had not yet come forth from  his house; and, before he was aware of the chief's reappearance, the  house had been surrounded and the usurper made prisoner.  Sindo, fast  bound and guarded, was now awaiting execution; and this was the  spectacle which the hunters were to be treated to.    It was a scene that none of the young hunters had any desire to be  present at; but, yielding to the importunities of their host, they  accompanied him to the spot where the execution was to take place.  This  was in the suburbs of the village, where they found the prisoner fast  tied to a tree.  Nearly all the inhabitants of the community had  assembled to see the usurper shot,--this being the manner of death that  had been awarded to him.    The prisoner was rather a good-looking man, apparently about thirty-five  years of age.  No evil propensity was expressed in his features; and our  heroes could not help thinking that he had been guilty of no greater  crime than a too hasty ambition.    \"Can we not save him from this cruel fate?\" asked Hans, speaking to  Groot Willem.  \"I think you have some influence with the chief.\"    \"There can be no harm in trying,\" answered Willem.  \"I'll see what I can  do.\"    Sindo was to be shot with his own musket.  The executioner had been  already appointed, and all other arrangements made for carrying out the  decree, when Willem, advancing towards Macora, commenced interceding for  his life.    His argument was, that the prisoner had not committed any great crime;  that had he conspired against his chief for the purpose of placing  himself in authority, it would have been a different affair.  Then he  would have deserved death.    Willem further urged, that had he, Macora, really been lost, some one of  the tribe would have become chief, and that Sindo was not to blame for  aspiring to resemble one who had ruled to the evident satisfaction of  all.    Macora was then entreated to spare the prisoner's life, and the entreaty  was backed by the promise of a gun to replace the one lost in the river,  on condition that Sindo should be allowed to live.    For a time Macora remained silent, but at length made reply, by saying  that he should never feel safe if the usurper were allowed to remain in  the community.    Groot Willem urged that he could be banished from the kraal, and  forbidden to return to it on penalty of death.    Macora hesitated a little longer; but remembering that he had promised  to grant any favour to the one who had released him from imprisonment in  the tree, he yielded.  Sindo's life should be spared on condition of his  expatriating himself at once and forever from the kraal of Macora.    On granting this pardon, the chief wished all distinctly to understand  that it was done out of gratitude to his friend, the big white hunter.  He did not wish it to be supposed that the prisoner's life had been  purchased with a gun.    All Macora's subjects, including the condemned man himself, appeared  greatly astonished at the decision, so contrary to all precedent among  his fellow-countrymen.    The exhibition of mercy, along with the refusal of the bribe, proved to  the young hunters, that Macora had within him the elements of a noble  nature.    Sindo, accompanied by his family, immediately made departure from the  place, going off to seek a home among kindred tribes, where his ambition  would, no doubt, be exercised with greater caution.    During the evening, Macora provided a varied entertainment for his  guests.  It included a grand feast, with songs and dancing, the latter  done to the sounds of the tom-tom drum, and one-stringed African fiddle.    All retired for the night with the understanding that the hunters should  the"]]]
