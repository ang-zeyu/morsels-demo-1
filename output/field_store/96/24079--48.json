Not understanding the bestial nature of the  kaffirs, they used them to help carry out their work of destruction,  and although they gave them no actual orders to molest the people,  they took no proper steps of preventing this.    When our commando passed through Newcastle, we found the place almost  entirely deserted, excepting for a few British subjects who had taken  an oath of neutrality to the Boers.    I regret to have to state that during our retreat a number of  irresponsible persons set fire to the Government buildings in that  town. It is said that an Italian officer burned a public hall on no  reasonable pretext; certainly he never received orders to that effect.  As may be expected of an invading army, some of our burgher patrols  and other isolated bodies of troops looted and destroyed a number of  houses which had been temporarily deserted. But with the exception of  these few cases, I can state that no outrages were committed by us in  Natal, and no property was needlessly destroyed.    On our arrival at Laing's Nek a Council of War was immediately held to  decide our future plans.    We now found ourselves once more on the old battlefields of 1880 and  1881, where Boer and Briton had met 20 years before to decide by trial  of arms who should be master of the S. A. Republic. Traces of that  desperate struggle were still plainly visible, and the historic height  of Majuba stood there, an isolated sentinel, recalling to us the  battle in which the unfortunate Colley lost both the day and his life.    I was told off to take up a position in the Nek where the wagon-road  runs to the east across the railway-tunnel, and here we made  preparations for digging trenches and placing our guns. Soon after we  had completed our entrenchments we once more saw the enemy. They were  lying at Schuinshoogte on the Ingogo, and had sent a mounted corps  with two guns to the Nek. Although we had no idea of the enemy's  strength, we were fully prepared to meet the attack; the Pretoria,  Lydenburg and other laagers were posted to the left on the summit of  Majuba Hill, and other commandos held good positions on the east. But  the enemy evidently thought that we had fled all the way back to  Pretoria, and not expecting to find the Nek occupied, advanced quite  unconcerned. We fired a few volleys at them, which caused them to halt  in considerable surprise, and, replying with a little artillery fire,  they quickly returned to Schuinshoogte. We had, however, to be on our  guard both day and night. It was bitterly cold at the time and a  strong easterly wind was blowing.    Next day something occurred which afforded a change to the monotony of  our situation, namely, the arrival from Pretoria of Mr. John Lombaard,  member of the First Volksraad for Bethel. He asked permission to  address us and informed us that we need only hold out another  fortnight, for news from Europe had reached them to the effect that  the Great Powers had decided to put an end to the War. This  communication emanating from such a semi-official source was believed  by a certain number of our men, but I think it did very little to  brighten up the spirits of the majority, or arouse them from the  lethargy into which they seemed to have fallen. A fortnight passed,  and a month, without us hearing anything further of this expected  intervention, and I have never been able to discover on whose  authority and by whose orders Mr. Lombaard made to us that remarkable  communication.    Meantime, General Buller did not seem at all anxious to attack us,  perhaps fearing a repetition of the \"accidents\" on the Tugela; or  possibly he thought that our position was too strong. For some reason,  therefore, Laing's Nek was never attacked, and Buller afterwards,  having made a huge \"detour,\" broke through Botha's Pass. Meanwhile,  Lord Roberts and his forces were marching without opposition through  the Orange Free State, and I was ordered to proceed to Vereeniging  with my commando. We left Laing's Nek on the 19th of May, and  proceeded to the Free State frontier by rail.          CHAPTER IX.    COLENSO AND SPION KOP FIGHTS.      Eight days after my commando had been stationed in my new position  under General Erasmus, I received instructions to march to  Potgietersdrift, on the Upper Tugela, near Spion Kop, and there to put  myself at Andries Cronje's disposal. This gentleman was then a general  in the Orange Free State Army, and although a very venerable looking  person, was not very successful as a commander. Up to the 14th of  December, 1899, no noteworthy incident took place, and nothing was  done but a little desultory scouting along the Tugela, and the digging  of trenches.    At last came the welcome order summoning us to action; and we were  bidden to march on Colenso Heights with 200 men to fill up the ranks,  as a fight was imminent. We left under General Cronje and arrived the  next morning at daybreak, and a few hours after began the battle now  known to the world as the Battle of Colenso (15th December, 1899).    I afterwards heard that the commandos under General Cronje were to  cross the river and attack the enemy's left flank. This did not  happen, as the greatest confusion prevailed owing to the various  contradictory orders given by the generals. For instance, I myself  received four contradictory orders from four generals within the space  of ten minutes. I, however, took the initiative in moving my men up to  the river to attempt the capture of a battery of guns on the enemy's  left flank which had been left unprotected, as was the case with the  ten guns which fell into our hands later in the day. I had approached  within 1,400 paces of the enemy, and my burghers were following close  behind me when an adjutant from General Botha (accompanied by a  gentleman named C. Fourie, who was then also parading as a general)  galloped up to us and ordered us at once to join the Ermelo commando,  which was said to be too weak to resist the attacks of the enemy. We  hurried thither as quickly as we could round the rear of the fighting  line, where we were obliged to off-saddle and walk up to the position  of the Ermelo burghers. This was no easy task; the battle was now in  full swing, and the enemy's shells were bursting in dozens around us,  and in the burning sun we had to run some miles.    When we arrived at our destination Mr. Fourie (the pseudo general) and  his adjutant could nowhere be found. As to the Ermelo burghers, they  said they were quite comfortable, and had asked for no assistance.    Not a single shell had reached them, for a clump of aloe trees stood a  hundred yards away, which the English presumably had taken for Boers,  judging by the terrific bombardment these trees were being subjected  to.    [Illustration: Along the Tugela--Coming suddenly upon an English  Outpost.]    By this time the attack was repulsed, and General Buller was in full  retreat to Chieveley, though our commando had been unable to take an  active part in the fighting, at which we were greatly disappointed.  It is much to be regretted that the retreat of the enemy was not  followed up at once. Had this been done, the campaign in Natal would  have taken an entirely different aspect, and very probably would have  been attended by a more favourable conclusion. I consider myself far  from a prophet, but this I know; and if we had then and on subsequent  occasions followed up our successes, the result of the Campaign would  have been far more satisfactory to us.    After I had assisted in bringing away through the river the guns we  had taken, and seen to other matters which required my immediate  attention, I was ordered to remain with the Ermelo commando at  Colenso, near Toomdrift, and to await there further instructions.    A few weeks of inactivity followed, the English sending us each day a  few samples of their shells from their 4.7 Naval guns. Unfortunately,  our guns were of much smaller calibre, and we could send them no  suitable reply. As a rule we would lie in the trenches, and a burgher  would be on the look-out. So soon as he saw the flash of an English  gun, he would cry out; \"There's a shell,\" and we then sought cover, so  that the enemy seldom succeeded in harming us.    One day one of these big shells fell amongst a group of fourteen  burghers who were at dinner. The shell struck a sharp rock, which it  splintered into fragments, and was emitting its yellow lyddite; but,  fortunately, the fuse refused to burn, and the shell did not explode,  so we had a narrow escape that day from a small catastrophe.    My laager had been at Potgietersdrift all this time, and for the time  being we were deprived of our tents. We were not sorry, therefore,  when we were ordered to leave Colenso and to return to our camp.    A few days after we were told off to take up a position at the  junction of the Little and the Big Tugela, between Spion Kop and  Colenso. Here we celebrated our first Christmas in the field; our  friends at Johannesburg had sent us a quantity of presents by means of  a friend, Attorney Raaff, comprising cakes, cigars, cigarettes,  tobacco and other luxuries. Along this part of the Tugela we found a  fair quantity of vegetables, and poultry, and as their respective  owners had fled we were unable to pay for what we had. We were  obliged, therefore, to \"borrow\" all these things for the banquet  befitting to the occasion.    But General Buller had not quite finished with us yet. He marched on  Spion Kop, but with the exception of a feint attack nothing of  importance happened then. One day I went across the river with a  patrol to discover what the enemy was doing, when we suddenly came  across nine English spies, who fled as soon as they saw us. We  galloped after them, trying to cut them off from the main body, which  was at a little distance away from us, and would no doubt have  overtaken them, but, riding at a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],[0,"The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#8)"],[1,"themselves.    _Lucy._ Yonder is my Father-- perhaps this way we may light upon the  Ordinary, who shall try if you will be as good as your Word. --For I  long to be made an honest Woman.

You  have consented to go halves in _Macheath_.    _Peachum._ We shall never fall out about an Execution-- But as to that  Article, pray how stands our last Year's Account?    _Lockit._ If you will run your Eye over it, you'll find 'tis fair and  clearly stated.    _Peachum._ This long Arrear of the Government is very hard upon us! Can  it be expected that we would hang our Acquaintance for nothing, when our  Betters will hardly save theirs without being paid for it. Unless the  People in Employment pay better, I promise them for the future, I shall  let other Rogues live besides their own.    _Lockit._ Perhaps, Brother, they are afraid these Matters may be carried  too far. We are treated too by them with Contempt, as if our Profession  were not reputable.    _Peachum._ In one respect indeed our Employment may be reckon'd  dishonest, because, like Great Statesmen, we encourage those who betray  their Friends.    _Lockit._ Such Language, Brother, any where else, might turn to your  Prejudice. Learn to be more guarded, I beg you.      AIR XXIX. How happy are we, &c.    [Music]        When you censure the Age,      Be cautious and sage,    Lest the Courtiers offended should be:      If you mention Vice or Bribe,      'Tis so pat to all the Tribe;    Each cries-- That was levell'd at me.    _Peachum._ Here's poor _Ned Clincher's_ Name, I see. Sure, Brother  _Lockit_, there was a little unfair Proceeding in _Ned's_ Case: for he  told me in the Condemn'd Hold, that for Value receiv'd, you had promis'd  him a Session or two longer without Molestation.    _Lockit._ Mr. _Peachum_-- this is the first time my Honour was ever  call'd in Question.    _Peachum._ Business is at an end-- if once we act dishonourably.    _Lockit._ Who accuses me?    _Peachum._ You are warm, Brother.    _Lockit._ He that attacks my Honour, attacks my Livelihood. --And this  Usage-- Sir-- is not to be borne.    _Peachum._ Since you provoke me to speak-- I must tell you too, that  Mrs. _Coaxer_ charges you with defrauding her of her Information-Money,  for the apprehending of curl-pated _Hugh_. Indeed, indeed, Brother, we  must punctually pay our Spies, or we shall have no Information.    _Lockit._ Is this Language to me, Sirrah,-- who have sav'd you from the  Gallows, Sirrah!    [Collaring each other.    _Peachum._ If I am hang'd, it shall be for ridding the World of an  arrant Rascal.    _Lockit._ This Hand shall do the Office of the Halter you deserve, and  throttle you-- you Dog!--    _Peachum._ Brother, Brother-- We are both in the Wrong-- We shall be  both Losers in the Dispute-- for you know we have it in our Power to  hang each other. You should not be so passionate.    _Lockit._ Nor you so provoking.    _Peachum._ 'Tis our mutual Interest; 'tis for the Interest of the World  we should agree. If I said any thing, Brother, to the Prejudice of your  Character, I ask pardon.    _Lockit._ Brother _Peachum_-- I can forgive as well as resent. --Give me  your Hand. Suspicion does not become a Friend.    _Peachum._ I only meant to give you Occasion to justify yourself: But I  must now step home, for I expect the Gentleman about this Snuff-box,  that _Filch_ nimm'd two Nights ago in the Park. I appointed him at this  Hour.    [Exit _Peachum_.      Enter _Lucy_.    _Lockit._ Whence come you, Hussy?    _Lucy._ My Tears might answer that Question.    _Lockit._ You have then been whimpering and fondling, like a Spaniel,  over the Fellow that hath abus'd you.    _Lucy._ One can't help Love; one can't cure it. 'Tis not in my Power to  obey you, and hate him.    _Lockit._ Learn to bear your Husband's Death like a reasonable Woman.  'Tis not the fashion, now-a-days, so much as to affect Sorrow upon these  Occasions. No Woman would ever marry, if she had not the Chance of  Mortality for a Release. Act like a Woman of Spirit, Hussy, and thank  your Father for what he is doing.      AIR XXX. Of a noble Race was _Shenkin_.    [Music]      _Lucy._ Is then his Fate decreed, Sir?      Such a Man can I think of quitting?    When first we met, so moves me yet,      O see how my Heart is splitting!    _Lockit._ Look ye, _Lucy_-- There is no saving him. --So, I think, you  must ev'n do like other Widows-- buy yourself Weeds, and be chearful.      AIR XXXI.    [Music]      You'll think ere many Days ensue      This Sentence not severe;    I hang your Husband, Child, 'tis true,      But with him hang your Care.        Twang dang dillo dee.    Like a good Wife, go moan over your dying Husband. That, Child is your  Duty-- Consider, Girl, you can't have the Man and the Money too-- so  make yourself as easy as you can, by getting all you can from him.        [Exit _Lockit_.      Enter _Macheath_.    _Lucy._ Though the Ordinary was out of the way to-day, I hope, my Dear,  you will, upon the first Opportunity, quiet my Scruples-- Oh Sir! --my  Father's hard heart is not to be soften'd, and I am in the utmost  Despair.    _Macheath._ But if I could raise a small Sum-- Would not twenty Guineas,  think you, move him? --Of all the Arguments in the way of Business, the  Perquisite is the most prevailing-- Your Father's Perquisites for the  Escape of Prisoners must amount to a considerable Sum in the Year. Money  well tim'd, and properly apply'd, will do any thing.      AIR XXXII. _London_ Ladies.    [Music]      If you at an Office solicit your Due,      And would not have Matters neglected;    You must quicken the Clerk with the Perquisite too,      To do what his Duty directed.      Or would you the Frowns of a Lady prevent,      She too has this palpable Failing,    The Perquisite softens her into Consent;      That Reason with all is prevailing.    _Lucy._ What Love or Money can do shall be done: for all my Comfort  depends upon your Safety.      Enter _Polly_.    _Polly._ Where is my dear Husband? --Was a Rope ever intended for this  Neck! --O let me throw my Arms about it, and throttle thee with Love!  --Why dost thou turn away from me? 'Tis thy _Polly_-- 'Tis thy Wife.    _Macheath._ Was ever such an unfortunate Rascal as I am!    _Lucy._ Was there ever such another Villain!    _Polly._ O _Macheath_! was it for this we parted? Taken! Imprisoned!  Try'd! Hang'd-- cruel Reflection! I'll stay with thee 'till Death-- no  Force shall tear thy dear Wife from thee now. --What means my Love?  --Not one kind Word! not one kind Look! think what thy _Polly_ suffers  to see thee in this Condition.

Villain!    _Polly._ Am I not thy Wife? --Thy Neglect of me, thy Aversion to me too  severely proves it. --Look on me. --Tell me, am I not thy Wife?    _Lucy._ Perfidious Wretch!    _Polly._ Barbarous Husband!    _Lucy._ Hadst thou been hang'd five Months ago, I had been happy.    _Polly._ And I too-- If you had been kind to me 'till Death, it would  not have vexed me-- And that's no very unreasonable Request, (though  from a Wife) to a Man who hath not above seven or eight Days to live.    _Lucy._ Art thou then married to another? Hast thou two Wives, Monster?    _Macheath._ If Women's Tongues can cease for an Answer-- hear me.    _Lucy._ I won't. --Flesh and Blood can't bear my Usage.    _Polly._ Shall I not claim my own?

But while you thus teaze me together,      To neither a Word will I say;        But tol de rol, &c.    _Polly._ Sure, my Dear, there ought to be some Preference shewn to a  Wife! At least she may claim the Appearance of it. He must be distracted  with his Misfortunes, or he could not use me thus.    _Lucy._ O Villain, Villain! thou hast deceiv'd me. --I could even inform  against thee with Pleasure. Not a Prude wishes more heartily to have  Facts against her intimate Acquaintance, than I now wish to have Facts  against thee. I would have her Satisfaction, and they should all out.

My Distresses are doubled.    _Lucy._ When you come to the Tree, should the Hangman refuse,    These Fingers, with Pleasure, could fasten the Noose.    _Polly._ I'm bubbled, &c.    _Macheath._ Be pacified, my dear _Lucy_-- This is all a Fetch of  _Polly's_, to make me desperate with you in case I get off. If I am  hang'd, she would fain have the Credit of being thought my Widow--  Really, _Polly_, this is no time for a Dispute of this sort; for  whenever you are talking of Marriage, I am thinking of Hanging.    _Polly._ And hast thou the Heart to persist in disowning me?    _Macheath._ And hast thou the Heart to persist in persuading me that I  am married? Why, _Polly_, dost thou seek to aggravate my Misfortunes?    _Lucy._ Really, Miss _Peachum_, you but expose yourself. Besides, 'tis  barbarous in you to worry a Gentleman in his Circumstances.
