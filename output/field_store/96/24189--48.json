Put these in a pastry bag. Toast the bread on one side, put the  peas around in rope-like form, or roses, on the untoasted side, making a  border sufficiently high to hold the lamb. Stand in the oven until the  bread is carefully toasted. Arrange them on lace papers on heated  plates, fill the center with the lamb mixture and send to the table.      Club-House Sandwiches    Club-house sandwiches may be made in a number of different ways, but are  served warm as a rule on bread carefully toasted at the last moment. Put  on top of a square of toasted bread a thin layer of broiled ham or  bacon; on top of this a thin slice of Holland pickle, on top of that a  thin slice of cold roasted chicken or turkey, then a leaf of lettuce in  the center of which you put a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing; cover  this with another slice of buttered toast. Press the two together, and  cut from one corner to another making two large triangles, and send at  once to the table.    People not using ham may make a palatable sandwich by putting down  first a layer of cold boiled tongue, then a layer of Holland cucumber, a  layer of turkey or chicken, another layer of cucumber and the slice of  toast. Garnish with little pieces of water cress before putting on the  last slice.          SCENTED SANDWICHES      There is a group of rather æsthetic sandwiches made from thin slices of  bread and butter flavored or scented with flowers. Among those in common  use are clover, rose and the nasturtium.    The crust is trimmed off from the outside of the loaf; the loaf placed  down in a clean stone jar in a nest of clover blossoms; the butter is  put in a piece of cheese cloth and also covered with clover, and the jar  covered over night. The next morning the bread and butter will have the  flavor of clover.      Rose Sandwiches    In making rose sandwiches cover the bread and butter with rose leaves  over night. Put a few rose petals between the slices when making the  sandwiches.      Nasturtium Sandwiches    Cover the bread and butter with nasturtium flowers over night. In making  the sandwiches place at each corner of the slice a flower, so that in  cutting from corner to corner you have a little triangular sandwich  holding a nasturtium flower uncut.      Violet Sandwiches    These are made the same, covering the slice of bread and butter with  the petals of the violet.

Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#8)"],[1," He was so fond of the  water that he became a rapid, untiring swimmer; and the boys trained  him, in intervals of rat-hunting, to dive to the bottom of the river  and pick up a white pebble thrown from the bank. Like Joker, also, he  gained a name for pluck and ability; and one night the village  sportsmen, at an informal meeting in the \"private room\" of the inn,  decided to hunt in the river on Wednesday evenings, with Bob and Joker  at the head of a pack including nearly every game-dog in the near  neighbourhood, except certain aristocratic pointers and setters likely  to be spoiled by companionship with yelping and excited curs.    A merrier hunting party was never in the world. They would foregather in  the meadow below the ruined garden: the landlord, whose home-brewed ale  was the best and strongest on the countryside; the curate, whose stern  admonitions were the terror of evil-doers; the farmer, whose skill in  ferreting was greater than in ploughing; the watchmaker, whose clocks  filled the village street with music when, simultaneously, they struck  the hour; the draper, whose white pigeons cooed and fluttered on the  bridge near his shop; the solicitor, whose law was for a time thrown to  the winds; and a small crowd of boys ready to assist, if required, in  \"chaining\" the fords. There they would \"cry\" the dogs across the stream  till the valley echoed and re-echoed with shouts and laughter.    The first hunt was started in spirited fashion; the men walked along the  bank thrusting their sticks into crevices and holes; but only Joker and  Bob entered the water, and rats and otters for a while remained  discreetly out of view. Near a bend of the stream, however, Bob  surprised a rat secreted by a stone, and, forcing it to rush to the  river, followed with frantic speed. Here, at last, was a chase; the  other dogs all hurried to the spot, and the landlord, swinging his  otter-pole, waded out to perform the duties of huntsman with the now  uproarious pack. His action proved infectious--watchmaker, draper,  lawyer, and curate splashed into the shallows to help in keeping the rat  on the move; and fun was fast and furious till the prey, fleeing from a  smart attack by Bob, was captured by a spaniel swimming under a big  oak-root between the curate and the bank.    I hardly think I have enjoyed any sport so well as those Wednesday  evening hunts in the bygone years, when life was unshadowed and each  sportsman of us felt within him the heart of a child. So great was our  amusement that the village urchins instituted a rival Hunt in the brooks  on Saturdays; they notched their sticks for every \"kill,\" and boasted  that they beat us hollow with the number of their trophies.    We had several adventures with otters, but the creatures always, in the  end, eluded us, and we soon were of opinion that smaller fry were  capable of affording better fun. Some seasons afterwards, when our Hunt  was disbanded, the shopkeepers' apprentices continued, with the  youngsters, to work our mongrel hounds; but eventually Joker's death  from the bite of an adder put an end to their pastime, for the bobtail  and the terrier were the only possible leaders of the nondescript pack.    Bob, the terrier, was always the most interesting of our hounds. He  manifested a disposition to use the other dogs to serve his purposes,  just as he used the unsuspecting fishermen if he wished to go hunting in  the woods. When with me after game on the upland farms, he often seemed  to forget entirely that I had taken him to hunt, not for his own  amusement only, but also for mine. Directly he discovered a rabbit  squatting in a clump of grass or brambles, perhaps ten or a dozen yards  from a hedge, he signalled his find by barking so incessantly that my  spaniels hastened pell-mell to the spot. This was just as it should  be--for Bob. Dancing with excitement, he waited between the clump and  the hedge till the spaniels entered and bolted the rabbit; then he tore  madly in close pursuit of the fleeing creature, and my chance of a shot  was spoiled through the possibility of my hitting him instead of his  quarry.    By the riverside, his tricks were precisely similar. Seeing a moorhen  dive, he would call the dogs around him, so that they might bring the  bird again to the surface and thus afford him sport. The moorhen,  meanwhile, invariably escaped; yet Bob failed to understand that he was  the only diver in the pack.    His antics were comical in the extreme if a vole eluded him by diving to  the lower entrance of its burrow beneath the surface of a backwater.  Having missed his opportunity, but unable to comprehend how he had  missed it, the terrier left the water, stood on the roots of a tree over  the entrance to the vole's burrow, and furiously barked instructions to  his companions swimming in the pool. Disgusted at last by their  inattention to his orders, he plunged headlong into the stream and  vanished for a few moments; then he reappeared, proud of his superior  bravery, sneezing and coughing, and with a mouthful of stones and soil  torn from the bank in his desperate efforts to force his way to the spot  whither the object of the chase had gone from view.    Bob long survived the big dog Joker, and in his old days loved as well  as ever the excitement of a hunt. His originality was preserved to the  end; stiffened by rheumatism and almost choked by asthma, he always,  when in search of rabbits, ran up-hill and walked down-hill, thus losing  both energy and breath that might with advantage have been kept in  reserve.    With the passing of the years, many changes have occurred to sunder the  friendships formed during those boylike expeditions. I smile when I  think how impossible it would be, now that the veneer of town life has  been thinly spread over the life of our village, for the man of law to  go wading, with tucked-up trousers, after rats; how impossible, also,  for him to frequent with me the bathing pool, as was sometimes his wont,  and swim idly hither and thither, while the moon peered between the  trees and the vague witchery of the summer night filled his spirit and  my own. My youthful feelings, long preserved, have been irrevocably  lost; and yet, if only for memory's sake, I would willingly hunt with  him again, and, when night had fallen, swim with him once more in the  dim, mysterious pool below the garden. But the old hunting party could  never be complete. Death makes gaps that Time fails to fill.    Those evenings were delightful, not only because of unrestrained mirth  and innocent sport, but also because we took a keen interest in our  surroundings, seeing the world of small things by the river-bank with  eyes such as belonged to anglers and hunters of the old-fashioned,  leisurely school. They marked for me the beginning of a pleasant study  of the water-voles that lived in their burrows on the brink of the  river, and were sometimes hunted as persistently as were the brown rats,  but far more frequently eluded our hounds than did the noxious little  brutes we particularly desired to destroy.    Wherever they take up their quarters, about the farmstead during winter  or in the open fields during summer, brown rats are an insufferable  nuisance. There is no courtesy or kindness in the nature of the rat; no  nesting bird is safe from his attacks, unless her home is beyond his  reach in some cleft of a rock that he cannot scale or in some fork of a  tree that he cannot climb. He is a cannibal--even the young and the sick  of his own kind become the victims of his rapacious hunger--and he will  eat almost anything, living or dead, from the refuse in a garbage heap  to the dainty egg of a willow-wren in the tiny, domed nest amid the  briars at the margin of the river.    The water-vole is often called, wrongly, the water-rat, but it is of  very different habits, and is well nigh entirely a vegetable feeder, and  one of the most charming and most inoffensive creatures in Britain. To  the close observer of Nature, differences in the character of  animals--even among the members of one species--soon become apparent. I  was struck with manifestations of such unlikeness when I kept small  communities of ants in artificial nests between slips of glass, so as  to watch their doings in my hours of leisure. One nest of yellow ants  contained at first a dozen workers and a queen; and when I began to  study them I used to mark with minute spots of white the bodies of the  particular ants under observation. These spots would remain till the  ants had time for their toilet and either licked themselves clean or  were licked clean by sympathetic companions. At the outset I found that  under a magnifying glass two of the dozen workers were readily  distinguishable from the others because of their size and shape.  Gradually, by detecting little peculiarities, I could single out the  ants, and so had no need to mark my tiny pets in order to follow their  movements, except on occasions when they clustered round the queen, or  rested, gossiping in little groups, here and there in the rooms and  passages of their dwelling. One ant was greedy, and, if she was the  first to find a fresh drop of honey I had placed outside the nest, would  feed to repletion without ever thinking of informing her friends of her  discovery. At such times she even became intoxicated, and I fancied  that, when she did at last get home, eager enquiries made as to the  whereabouts of the nectar met with incoherent replies, since the seekers  for information generally failed to profit by what they were told, and  had to cast about aimlessly for some time before finding the food. I  also observed that another ant was perfectly unselfish, and not only  would inform her companions directly she discovered honey, but would  assiduously feed the queen before attending to her own requirements. And  so my pets were separately known because of faults and failings or"]]]
