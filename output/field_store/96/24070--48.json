Carry never sewed on pretty dresses for herself, for the simple reason  that she never had any pretty dresses. Carry was twenty-two--and  feeling forty, her last pretty dress had been when she was a girl of  twelve, before her father had died. To be sure, there was the silk  organdie Aunt Kathleen had sent her, but that was fit only for  parties, and Carry never went to any parties.    \"Did you get any mail, Patty?\" she asked unexpectantly. There was  never much mail for the Lea girls.    \"Yes'm,\" said Patty briskly. \"Here's the _Weekly Advocate_, and a  patent medicine almanac with all your dreams expounded, _and_ a letter  for Miss Carry M. Lea. It's postmarked Enfield, and has a suspiciously  matrimonial look. I'm sure it's an invitation to Chris Fairley's  wedding. Hurry up and see, Caddy.\"    Carry, with a little flush of excitement on her face, opened her  letter. Sure enough, it contained an invitation \"to be present at the  marriage of Christine Fairley.\"    \"How jolly!\" exclaimed Patty. \"Of course you'll go, Caddy. You'll have  a chance to wear that lovely organdie of yours at last.\"    \"It was sweet of Chris to invite me,\" said Carry. \"I really didn't  expect it.\"    \"Well, I did. Wasn't she your most intimate friend when she lived in  Enderby?\"    \"Oh, yes, but it is four years since she left, and some people might  forget in four years. But I might have known Chris wouldn't. Of course  I'll go.\"    \"And you'll make up your organdie?\"    \"I shall have to,\" laughed Carry, forgetting all her troubles for a  moment, and feeling young and joyous over the prospect of a festivity.  \"I haven't another thing that would do to wear to a wedding. If I  hadn't that blessed organdie I couldn't go, that's all.\"    \"But you have it, and it will look lovely made up with a tucked skirt.  Tucks are so fashionable now. And there's that lace of mine you can  have for a bertha. I want you to look just right, you see. Enfield is  a big place, and there will be lots of grandees at the wedding. Let's  get the last fashion sheet and pick out a design right away. Here's  one on the very first page that would be nice. You could wear it to  perfection, Caddy you're so tall and slender. It wouldn't suit a plump  and podgy person like myself at all.\"    Carry liked the pattern, and they had an animated discussion over it.  But, in the end, Carry sighed, and pushed the sheet away from her,  with all the brightness gone out of face.    \"It's no use, Patty. I'd forgotten for a few minutes, but it's all  come back now. I can't think of weddings and new dresses, when the  thought of that interest crowds everything else out. It's due next  month--fifty dollars--and I've only ten saved up. I can't make forty  dollars in a month, even if I had any amount of sewing, and you know  hardly anyone wants sewing done just now. I don't know what we shall  do. Oh, I suppose we can rent a couple of rooms in the village and  _exist_ in them. But it breaks my heart to think of leaving our old  home.\"    \"Perhaps Mr. Kerr will let us have more time,\" suggested Patty, not  very hopefully. The sparkle had gone out of her face too. Patty loved  their little home as much as Carry did.    \"You know he won't. He has been only too anxious for an excuse to  foreclose, this long time. He wants the land the house is on. Oh, if I  only hadn't been sick so long in the summer--just when everybody had  sewing to do. I've tried so hard to catch up, but I couldn't.\" Carry's  voice broke in a sob.    Patty leaned over the table and patted her sister's glossy dark hair  gently.    \"You've worked too hard, dearie. You've just gone to skin and bone.  Oh, I know how hard it is! I can't bear to think of leaving this dear  old spot either. If we could only induce Mr. Kerr to give us a year's  grace! I'd be teaching then, and we could easily pay the interest and  some of the principal too. Perhaps he will if we both go to him and  coax very hard. Anyway, don't worry over it till after the wedding. I  want you to go and have a good time. You never have good times,  Carry.\"    \"Neither do you,\" said Carry rebelliously. \"You never have anything  that other girls have, Patty--not even pretty clothes.\"    \"Deed, and I've lots of things to be thankful for,\" said Patty  cheerily. \"Don't you fret about me. I'm vain enough to think I've got  some brains anyway, and I'm a-meaning to do something with them too.  Now I think I'll go upstairs and study this evening. It will be warm  enough there tonight, and the noise of the machine rather bothers me.\"    Patty whisked out, and Carry knew she should go to her sewing. But she  sat a long while at the table in dismal thought. She was so tired, and  so hopeless. It had been such a hard struggle, and it seemed now as if  it would all come to naught. For five years, ever since her mother's  death, Carry had supported herself and Patty by dressmaking. They had  been a hard five years of pinching and economizing and going without,  for Enderby was only a small place, and there were two other  dressmakers. Then there was always the mortgage to devour everything.  Carry had kept it at bay till now, but at last she was conquered. She  had had typhoid fever in the spring and had not been able to work for  a long time. Indeed, she had gone to work before she should. The  doctor's bill was yet unpaid, but Dr. Hamilton had told her to take  her time. Carry knew she would not be pressed for that, and next year  Patty would be able to help her. But next year would be too late. The  dear little home would be lost then.    When Carry roused herself from her sad reflections, she saw a crumpled  note lying on the floor. She picked it up and absently smoothed it  out. Seeing Patty's name at the top she was about to lay it aside  without reading it, but the lines were few, and the sense of them  flashed into Carry's brain. The note was an invitation to Clare  Forbes's party! The Lea girls had known that the Forbes girls were  going to give a party, but they had not expected that Patty would be  invited. Of course, Clare Forbes was in Patty's class at school and  was always very nice and friendly with her. But then the Forbes set  was not the Lea set.    Carry ran upstairs to Patty's room. \"Patty, you dropped this on the  floor. I couldn't help seeing what it was. Why didn't you tell me  Clare had invited you?\"    \"Because I knew I couldn't go, and I thought you would feel badly over  that. Caddy, I wish you hadn't seen it.\"    \"Oh, Patty, I _do_ wish you could go to the party. It was so sweet of  Clare to invite you, and perhaps she will be offended if you don't  go--she won't understand. Clare Forbes isn't a girl whose friendship  is to be lightly thrown away when it is offered.\"    \"I know that. But, Caddy dear, it is impossible. I don't think that I  have any foolish pride about clothes, but you know it is out of the  question to think of going to Clare Forbes's party in my last winter's  plaid dress, which is a good two inches too short and skimpy in  proportion. Putting my own feelings aside, it would be an insult to  Clare. There, don't think any more about it.\"    But Carry did think about it. She lay awake half the night wondering  if there might not be some way for Patty to go to that party. She knew  it was impossible, unless Patty had a new dress, and how could a new  dress be had? Yet she did so want Patty to go. Patty never had any  good times, and she was studying so hard. Then, all at once, Carry  thought of a way by which Patty might have a new dress. She had been  tossing restlessly, but now she lay very still, staring with wide-open  eyes at the moonlit window, with the big willow boughs branching  darkly across it. Yes, it was a way, but could she? _Could_ she? Yes,  she could, and she would. Carry buried her face in her pillow with a  sob and a gulp. But she had decided what must be done, and how it must  be done.    \"Are you going to begin on your organdie today?\" asked Patty in the  morning, before she started for school.    \"I must finish Mrs. Pidgeon's suit first,\" Carry answered. \"Next week  will be time enough to think about my wedding garments.\"    She tried to laugh and failed. Patty thought with a pang that Carry  looked horribly pale and tired--probably she had worried most of the  night over the interest. \"I'm so glad she's going to Chris's wedding,\"  thought Patty, as she hurried down the street. \"It will take her out  of herself and give her something nice to think of for ever so long.\"    Nothing more was said that week about the organdie, or the wedding, or  the Forbes's party. Carry sewed fiercely, and sat at her machine for  hours after Patty had gone to bed. The night before the party she said  to Patty, \"Braid your hair tonight, Patty. You'll want it nice and  wavy to go to the Forbes's tomorrow night.\"    Patty thought that Carry was actually trying to perpetrate a weak  joke, and endeavoured to laugh. But it was a rather dreary laugh.  Patty, after a hard evening's study, felt tired and discouraged, and  she was really dreadfully disappointed about the party, although she  wouldn't have let Carry suspect it for the world.    \"You're going, you know,\" said Carry, as serious as a judge, although  there was a little twinkle in her eyes.    \"In a faded plaid two inches too short?\" Patty smiled as brightly as  possible.    \"Oh, no. I have a dress all ready for you.\" Carry opened the wardrobe  door and took out--the loveliest girlish dress of creamy organdie,  with pale pink roses scattered over it, made with the daintiest of  ruffles and tucks, with a bertha of soft creamy lace, and a girdle of  white silk. \"This is for you,\" said Carry.    Patty gazed at the dress with horror-stricken eyes. \"C"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#8)"],[1,"in a pomp of scarlet and gold. \"There was a time when she  wasn't, master--you've heard? But for years now she has been quite  able to look after herself. And so, if I fare forth on the last great  adventure some of these days Tamzine will not be left helpless.\"    \"She is ten years older than you. It is likely she will go before  you,\" I said.    Abel shook his head and stroked his smart beard. I always suspected  that beard of being Abel's last surviving vanity. It was always so  carefully groomed, while I had no evidence that he ever combed his  grizzled mop of hair.    \"No, Tamzine will outlive me. She's got the Armstrong heart. I have  the Marwood heart--my mother was a Marwood. We don't live to be old,  and we go quick and easy. I'm glad of it. I don't think I'm a coward,  master, but the thought of a lingering death gives me a queer sick  feeling of horror. There, I'm not going to say any more about it. I  just mentioned it so that some day when you hear that old Abel  Armstrong has been found dead, you won't feel sorry. You'll remember I  wanted it that way. Not that I'm tired of life either. It's very  pleasant, what with my garden and Captain Kidd and the harbour out  there. But it's a trifle monotonous at times and death will be  something of a change, master. I'm real curious about it.\"    \"I hate the thought of death,\" I said gloomily.    \"Oh, you're young. The young always do. Death grows friendlier as we  grow older. Not that one of us really wants to die, though, master.  Tennyson spoke truth when he said that. There's old Mrs. Warner at the  Channel Head. She's had heaps of trouble all her life, poor soul, and  she's lost almost everyone she cared about. She's always saying that  she'll be glad when her time comes, and she doesn't want to live any  longer in this vale of tears. But when she takes a sick spell, lord,  what a fuss she makes, master! Doctors from town and a trained nurse  and enough medicine to kill a dog! Life may be a vale of tears, all  right, master, but there are some folks who enjoy weeping, I reckon.\"    Summer passed through the garden with her procession of roses and  lilies and hollyhocks and golden glow. The golden glow was  particularly fine that year. There was a great bank of it at the lower  end of the garden, like a huge billow of sunshine. Tamzine revelled in  it, but Abel liked more subtly-tinted flowers. There was a certain  dark wine-hued hollyhock which was a favourite with him. He would sit  for hours looking steadfastly into one of its shallow satin cups. I  found him so one afternoon in the hop-vine arbour.    \"This colour always has a soothing effect on me,\" he explained.  \"Yellow excites me too much--makes me restless--makes me want to sail  'beyond the bourne of sunset'. I looked at that surge of golden glow  down there today till I got all worked up and thought my life had been  an awful failure. I found a dead butterfly and had a little  funeral--buried it in the fern corner. And I thought I hadn't been  any more use in the world than that poor little butterfly. Oh, I was  woeful, master. Then I got me this hollyhock and sat down here to look  at it alone. When a man's alone, master, he's most with God--or with  the devil. The devil rampaged around me all the time I was looking at  that golden glow; but God spoke to me through the hollyhock. And it  seemed to me that a man who's as happy as I am and has got such a  garden has made a real success of living.\"    \"I hope I'll be able to make as much of a success,\" I said sincerely.    \"I want you to make a different kind of success, though, master,\" said  Abel, shaking his head. \"I want you to _do_ things--the things I'd  have tried to do if I'd had the chance. It's in you to do them--if you  set your teeth and go ahead.\"    \"I believe I _can_ set my teeth and go ahead now, thanks to you, Mr.  Armstrong,\" I said. \"I was heading straight for failure when I came  here last spring; but you've changed my course.\"    \"Given you a sort of compass to steer by, haven't I?\" queried Abel  with a smile. \"I ain't too modest to take some credit for it. I saw I  could do _you_ some good. But my garden has done more than I did, if  you'll believe it. It's wonderful what a garden can do for a man when  he lets it have its way. Come, sit down here and bask, master. The  sunshine may be gone to-morrow. Let's just sit and think.\"    We sat and thought for a long while. Presently Abel said abruptly:    \"You don't see the folks I see in this garden, master. You don't see  anybody but me and old Tamzine and Captain Kidd. I see all who used to  be here long ago. It was a lively place then. There were plenty of us  and we were as gay a set of youngsters as you'd find anywhere. We  tossed laughter backwards and forwards here like a ball. And now old  Tamzine and older Abel are all that are left.\"    He was silent a moment, looking at the phantoms of memory that paced  invisibly to me the dappled walks and peeped merrily through the  swinging boughs. Then he went on:    \"Of all the folks I see here there are two that are more vivid and  real than all the rest, master. One is my sister Alice. She died  thirty years ago. She was very beautiful. You'd hardly believe that to  look at Tamzine and me, would you? But it is true. We always called  her Queen Alice--she was so stately and handsome. She had brown eyes  and red gold hair, just the colour of that nasturtium there. She was  father's favourite. The night she was born they didn't think my mother  would live. Father walked this garden all night. And just under that  old apple-tree he knelt at sunrise and thanked God when they came to  tell him that all was well.    \"Alice was always a creature of joy. This old garden rang with her  laughter in those years. She seldom walked--she ran or danced. She  only lived twenty years, but nineteen of them were so happy I've never  pitied her over much. She had everything that makes life worth  living--laughter and love, and at the last sorrow. James Milburn was  her lover. It's thirty-one years since his ship sailed out of that  harbour and Alice waved him good-bye from this garden. He never came  back. His ship was never heard of again.    \"When Alice gave up hope that it would be, she died of a broken heart.  They say there's no such thing; but nothing else ailed Alice. She  stood at yonder gate day after day and watched the harbour; and when  at last she gave up hope life went with it. I remember the day: she  had watched until sunset. Then she turned away from the gate. All the  unrest and despair had gone out of her eyes. There was a terrible  peace in them--the peace of the dead. 'He will never come back now,  Abel,' she said to me.    \"In less than a week she was dead. The others mourned her, but I  didn't, master. She had sounded the deeps of living and there was  nothing else to linger through the years for. _My_ grief had spent  itself earlier, when I walked this garden in agony because I could  not help her. But often, on these long warm summer afternoons, I seem  to hear Alice's laughter all over this garden; though she's been dead  so long.\"    He lapsed into a reverie which I did not disturb, and it was not until  another day that I learned of the other memory that he cherished. He  reverted to it suddenly as we sat again in the hop-vine arbour,  looking at the glimmering radiance of the September sea.    \"Master, how many of us are sitting here?\"    \"Two in the flesh. How many in the spirit I know not,\" I answered,  humouring his mood.    \"There is one--the other of the two I spoke of the day I told you  about Alice. It's harder for me to speak of this one.\"    \"Don't speak of it if it hurts you,\" I said.    \"But I want to. It's a whim of mine. Do you know why I told you of  Alice and why I'm going to tell you of Mercedes? It's because I want  someone to remember them and think of them sometimes after I'm gone. I  can't bear that their names should be utterly forgotten by all living  souls.    \"My older brother, Alec, was a sailor, and on his last voyage to the  West Indies he married and brought home a Spanish girl. My father and  mother didn't like the match. Mercedes was a foreigner and a Catholic,  and differed from us in every way. But I never blamed Alec after I saw  her. It wasn't that she was so very pretty. She was slight and dark  and ivory-coloured. But she was very graceful, and there was a charm  about her, master--a mighty and potent charm. The women couldn't  understand it. They wondered at Alec's infatuation for her. I never  did. I--I loved her, too, master, before I had known her a day. Nobody  ever knew it. Mercedes never dreamed of it. But it's lasted me all my  life. I never wanted to think of any other woman. She spoiled a man  for any other kind of woman--that little pale, dark-eyed Spanish girl.  To love her was like drinking some rare sparkling wine. You'd never  again have any taste for a commoner draught.    \"I think she was very happy the year she spent here. Our thrifty  women-folk in Stillwater jeered at her because she wasn't what they  called capable. They said she couldn't do anything. But she could do  one thing well--she could love. She worshipped Alec. I used to hate  him for it. Oh, my heart has been very full of black thoughts in its  time, master. But neither Alec nor Mercedes ever knew. And I'm  thankful now that they were so happy. Alec made this arbour for  Mercedes--at least he made the trellis, and she planted the vines.    \"She used to sit here most of the time in summer. I suppose that's why  I like to sit here. Her eyes would be dreamy and far-away until Alec  would flash his welcome. How that used to torture me! But now I like  to remember it. And her pretty soft foreign voice and little white  hands. She died after she had lived here a year. They buried her and  her baby in the graveyard of that little chapel over the harbour where  the bell rings every evening. She used to "]]]
