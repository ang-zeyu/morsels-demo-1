In       this case the pilot makes for Scotland lightship, and merely keeps       New Dorp and Elmtree beacons in range, giving Dry Romer a wide       berth to starboard, until Chapel Hill and Conover beacons come into       range on his port side. The vessel is then held on a course between       Coney Island and Fort Tompkins lights until Robbins Reef light       shows ahead.         For the liners that draw more than eighteen feet the task is more       difficult, inasmuch as the channel is tortuous. At Sandy Hook       lightship a course lying nearly west takes the vessel to the outer       entrance of Gedney Channel, marked by two buoy-lights. In passing       between the lights the vessel enters the channel, which is also       covered by the red sector of Hook beacon. The pilot continues       between the buoy-lights until Waacaack and Point Comfort beacons       are in range, and steers to this range until South Beacon and Sandy       Hook light are in range astern. The helm is then turned, keeping       these lights in range astern until Chapel Hill and Conover beacons       are in range on the port bow. Turning northward nearly eight       points, the pilot holds the bow of the vessel between Fort Tompkins       and Coney Island lights, keeping sharply to his range astern, until       Robbins Reef light comes into view through the narrows. From this       point on, the shore lights are the pilot's chief guide.         So difficult are harbor entrances, that in most cases the       underwriters will not insure a vessel unless the latter is taken       from the outer harbor to the dock by a licensed pilot, and the       latter must spend nearly half a lifetime as an apprentice before he       receives a license. The charges for pilotage are usually regulated       by the number of feet the vessel draws. The charges differ in       various ports, but the devices for marking and lighting the       channels are much the same in every part of the world. In the       United States all navigable channels are under the control of the       general Government.    =Inland Waters.=--Lakes, rivers, and canals furnish a very important means  of transportation. In Europe and Canada an enormous amount of slow  freight is transported by their use; in China they are the most  important means of internal traffic.    [Illustration: THE COMMERCE OF THE OHIO--TOWING COAL TO THE STEEL  MILLS, PITTSBURG]    In the United States the Great Lakes with the Erie Canal and Hudson  River form the most important internal water-way, and by them the  continent is penetrated as far west as Duluth, a distance of more than  one thousand three hundred miles. The traffic passing out of Lake  Superior alone is about one-third greater than that passing out of the  Mediterranean Sea at the Suez Canal. Much of this traffic goes across  the continent, and the route in question is one of the great commercial  highways of the world.    The Mississippi River and its branches afford not far from ten thousand  miles of navigable waters. Canals connect tributaries of this river with  the Great Lakes at Chicago and at several points in Ohio. The  development of the navigation of this great water-way was checked by the  Civil War, and after the close of the war the great advance in railway  building kept its improvement in the background. The general government,  nevertheless, has done much to encourage the use of the Mississippi as a  commercial highway, and many millions of dollars have been spent in  widening and deepening its channel.[8] On the upper river grain and  lumber form the chief traffic; on the lower part a large part of the  world's cotton-crop starts on its journey to the various markets.    On account of the soft-coal fields and the steel manufacture in western  Pennsylvania, the commerce of the Ohio River is very heavy, aggregating  not far from fifteen million tons yearly. Much of this traffic extends  to ports on the Mississippi.    The navigable parts of the Hudson and Delaware Rivers are estuaries of  the sea or \"drowned valleys.\" In each case navigation extends about to  the limits of high tide. Both rivers carry a heavy freight commerce; the  Hudson has a passenger traffic of several million fares each year.  Nearly every river of the Atlantic coast is navigable to the limit of  high tide or a little beyond. Navigation extends to the point where the  coast-plain joins the foot-hills. Above this limit, called the \"Fall  Line,\" the streams are swift and shallow; below it they are deep and  sluggish. As a result, a chain of important river ports extends along  the Fall Line from Maine to Florida.    River-navigation in Europe in the main is inseparably connected with the  great canal systems. As a rule, the lower parts of the rivers are  navigable for steamboats of light draught. Some of the smaller streams  are made navigable by means of a long steel chain, which is laid along  the bed of the stream; the boat engages the chain by means of heavy  sprocket wheels driven by steam, and thus wind the boat up and down the  river.    Ocean steamers penetrate the Amazon Valley to a distance of one thousand  miles from its mouth; boats of light draught ascend the main stream and  some of its tributaries a thousand miles farther. The Orinoco is  navigable within one hundred miles of Bogota. Light-draught boats ascend  the tributaries of La Plata River a distance of fifteen hundred miles.    The Asian rivers that are important highways of commerce are few in  number. The Amur, Yangtze, Indus, and Cambodia have each considerable  local commerce. The Hugli, a channel in the delta of the Ganges, has a  channel deep enough for ocean steamships. The tributaries of the Lena,  Yenisei, and Ob have been of the greatest service in the commercial  development of northern Asia from the fact that their valleys are both  level and fertile.    Because of a high interior and abrupt slopes, the rivers of Africa are  not suitable for navigation to any considerable extent; the channels are  uncertain and the rivers are interrupted by rapids. The Nile has an  occasional steamboat service as far as the \"First Cataract,\" but in high  water the service is sometimes extended farther. The Kongo has a long  stretch of navigable water, but is interrupted by rapids below Stanley  Pool. Similar conditions obtain in the Zambezi. The lower part of the  Senegal affords good navigation. The Niger has in many respects greater  commercial possibilities than other rivers of Africa. It is navigable to  a distance of three hundred miles.    =Canals.=--Canals easily rank among the most important means of traffic,  as a rule, supplementing other navigable waters. Thus, by means of an  elaborate system of canals, goods are transferred by water, from one  river-basin to another, so that practically all the navigable streams of  western Europe are connected. Canals are extensively used to avoid the  falls or rapids that separate the various reaches of rivers. The water  itself by means of locks lifts the boat to a higher level or transfers  it to a lower reach, thus saving the expense of unloading, transferring,  and reloading a cargo.    The manner in which canals supplement the obstructed navigation of a  river is seen in the case of the St. Lawrence. This river is obstructed  in several places by rapids, but by means of canals steamship service  connects the Great Lakes, not only with Quebec, but with ports of the  Mediterranean Sea as well; indeed, it is possible to send a cargo from  Duluth, at the head of Lake Superior, to Odessa or Batum, on the shores  of the Black Sea.    The internal water-ways of Canada have been splendidly developed. The  Canadian St. Marys Canal furnishes an outlet to Lake Superior for  vessels drawing twenty-one feet. The Welland Canal connects Lakes Erie  and Ontario. The Rideau Canal and River connect Kingston and Lake  Ontario with the Ottawa, and the latter with its canals is navigable to  the St. Lawrence. With a population of less than six millions the  Dominion Government has spent nearly one hundred million dollars in the  improvement of internal water-ways.    [Illustration: PROFILE OF ERIE CANAL    HORIZONTAL SCALE 100 MILES TO THE INCH, VERTICAL SCALE 1,000 FEET TO THE  INCH]    In the United States the possible development of canals has been  neglected and, to a certain extent, stifled by railway building. The  Erie Canal, built before the advent of the railway, connects Lake Erie  with tide-water at Albany, a distance of 387 miles. For many years it  was the chief means of traffic between the Mississippi Valley and the  Atlantic seaboard, and although paralleled by the six tracks of a great  railway system, it is still an important factor in the carriage of grain  and certain classes of slow freight.[9] The level way that made the  canal possible is largely responsible for the decline of its importance,  for the absence of steep grades enables a powerful locomotive to haul  so many cars that the quick transit more than overbalances a very low  ton rate by the canal.    The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, designed to connect the Mississippi  Valley with the Atlantic seaboard, fared much worse than the Erie Canal.  Less than two hundred miles have been completed, and practically no work  except that of repair has been done since 1850; the heavy grades between  Cumberland and Pittsburg render its completion improbable.    An excellent system of canals, the Ohio and Erie and the Miami and Erie,  connect the Ohio River with Lake Erie. These canals are in the State of  Ohio and aggregate about six hundred miles in length. They are important  as coal and ore carriers. Several hundred miles of canals were built  along the river-valleys of eastern Pennsylvania before 1840 for carrying  coal to tide-water. Most of them have been abandoned; one, the Delaware  & Hudson Canal Co.,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24902"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 4, March, 1851 (#8)"],[1,"most interest and delight the general reader.  It contains thirty-two letters, mainly on the following subjects: the  view of nature in general; the religious view; the various forms of the  religious view; the aesthetic view; the inward connection of the aesthetic  enjoyment of nature with its artistic representation; the scientific  view as empirical science and natural philosophy; the relations of the  various views of nature to each other; the poetic comprehension of  nature among the Indians; the poetic comprehension of nature among the  Jews, the Greeks, and the Romans; the Christian contemplation of nature;  German poetry in the middle ages; Italian poetry; the poetic  comprehension of nature in modern times; the representation of nature by  painting, and its gradual appearance in the history of art; the  physiognomy of plants in connection with the physiognomy of nature in  general; description of several plant formations; general outlines of  the animal world; history of the physical view of the universe; natural  science among the Phenicians, the Greeks, at the time of the Ptolemies,  at the time of the Roman Empire, and in the middle ages; natural history  of modern times, Bacon, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton; the  mechanical doctrine of modern physics; the dynamic view of nature;  Fichte's doctrine, and the natural philosophy of Schelling and Hegel.  This volume, as will be easily understood, gives at once a history of  religion, philosophy, art, literature, and science, in their relations  to the outward universe. For instance, under the head of natural science  among the Greeks, we have among other things an account of the doctrine  of the Pythagoreans, Plato, and Aristotle; in treating the middle ages,  Professor Schaller speaks of the Scholastics, Thomas Aquinas, Roger  Bacon, Giordano Bruno, and Paracelsus. One of the most interesting parts  of the whole is that on the poetic view of nature among the Hindoos,  Jews, Greeks, Romans, Germans, and Italians, the historical statement  being every where illustrated by copious quotations of admirable  passages from the poets of those nations. The strictly scientific  portions are illustrated by excellent engravings, and are free from mere  technicalities. Sold in New-York by R.

Eusebe-Francois de Salles has just published at  Paris an elaborate work on Ethnography, for which he had prepared  himself by long and careful personal observation of most of the races on  the globe, his travels having extended into nearly all climes and  regions. He takes the ground of the descent of the entire human family  from a single pair, created adult and perfect in mind and body, not by  any simple evolution of nature, but by a direct act of the Divine Being.  The paradise or home of this pair he places to the north of India and  the east of Persia. All the varieties of men now existing he attributes  to the influence of climate and circumstances. \"The first light of  history,\" he says, \"shows us the human family in possession of a  language, and of a certain degree of science, the inheritance of the  past. Its aptitudes, its passions, and outward circumstances, may  increase this inheritance, keep it the same, or diminish it. In peoples  enervated by luxury and by doubt, in tribes softened by too favorable a  climate, or separated too long from the stronger and better educated  masses,--in a family or a couple exiled by a catastrophe, a  shipwreck,--we are to seek the origin of the decline into the various  degrees of _corruption, barbarism_, the _savage state_, and _brutality_.  Imagine a boat from the coast of America, or from the South Sea Islands,  cast by a tempest on some unknown shore or some desert island. A few  young persons, a few children, alone escape from the shipwreck, knowing  imperfectly the language, the arts, and the family traditions of their  parents. Such is the origin of the unfortunates sometimes met with, who  are ignorant even of the use of fire.\" Against the spontaneous  generation of the human race in several localities he argues at length  as an utter absurdity, the point of his argument being, that isolated  couples so produced would be unable to resist the inhospitality of  nature without miraculous aid, and one miracle, he contends, is more  admissable than ten or a dozen. But the chief grounds upon which he  labors to establish his doctrine are the similitude of the most ancient  traditions among all branches of the human species, the affiliation and  analogy of languages, and the identity of organization and equality of  aptitudes. He finds similar traditions among the Hebrews, the Chaldeans,  the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, the Hindoos, the  Persians, the Chinese, the Thibetans, the Scythians, and the Americans.  In the theogonies and cosmogonies of the Aztecs of America, he says that  the traditions of ancient Asia are plainly to be found, while some vague  traces of these primitive narratives are to be found even among the  savages of Oceanica, and the most barbarous and miserable negroes of  western Africa. To the negroes he devotes perhaps the most careful and  learned portion of the work. Starting from the discovery of M. Flaurens  as to the _pigmentum_ or coloring matter of the skin, he contends with  great force that nothing but the gradual influence of climate, giving a  greater and greater intensity to the action of this coloring matter,  which exists in every race and every individual, has caused the  essential difference between whites and blacks. For, he argues, there is  no other difference between them than that of color, all the other  features, such as the prominent mouth, the woolly hair, the facial  angle, being in no wise exclusively peculiar to the Africans. And so,  after having gone over the entire race in detail, proving the identity  of organization in every division, M. de Salles concludes that the  primitive complexion was olive, somewhat like the color of unburnt  coffee, and the original men had red hair. On the affiliation of  languages he reasons at great length, with a striking affluence of  curious and learned detail. Languages, he remarks, become more and more  complicated and perfect as we ascend toward their origin. Next he  considers the modifications by which the present races of men have  departed from the first family, and in so doing he takes up every people  that has ever been known. America, he thinks, was first settled by  Mongol emigration, with religious traditions, between the eighteenth and  the fifteenth century before our era: then, six or eight hundred years  later, there was a second emigration of Hindoo races, with traditions of  architecture. With the Bible and the facts of geology as his starting  point, he demonstrates the falsity of the Egyptian, Hindoo, Chinese, and  Mexican chronologies. The six days of creation he takes as so many great  epochs; the deluge he places at five thousand years before Christ.    In our account of this book we have not strictly followed the order of  the author. Thus he makes the direct miraculous creation of man the  concluding topic of his book, and treats it not without a certain poetic  elevation as comports with such an event. We have aimed only to give the  outlines of his doctrine, and for the rest recommend those of our  readers who are interested in such studies to procure and read the work.           *       *       *       *       *    JOACHIM LELEWEL (a name honored by all lovers of liberty,) has just  published at Breslau a work on the geography of the middle ages, which  is worthy of the warmest admiration.

While the Palatinate and the left bank  of the Rhine were ravaged by the French armies, the fortress of  Rheinfels held out obstinately against a siege which was prosecuted with  fury by a much superior force. Amid the scenes of this siege, passes the  love-story that forms the kernel of the novel, which is written with  originality and talent. The historical part is equally attractive and  _vraisemblant_. A collection of romances under the title of _Germania_,  has appeared at Bremen. It is intended to serve as the beginning of an  annual publication. The first number contains seven tales, some of them  by well known romance writers.
