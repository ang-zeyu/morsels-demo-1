Upon whose casting up a bank before  the city Ptolemais, I also pitched my camp at about the distance of  sixty furlongs from that village. And now we frequently brought out our  forces as if we would fight, but proceeded no further than skirmishes at  a distance; for when Placidus perceived that I was earnest to come to  a battle, he was afraid, and avoided it. Yet did he not remove from the  neighborhood of Ptolemais.    44. About this time it was that Jonathan and his fellow legates came.  They were sent, as we have said already, by Simon, and Ananus the high  priest. And Jonathan contrived how he might catch me by treachery;  for he durst not make any attempt upon me openly. So he wrote me the  following epistle: \"Jonathan and those that are with him, and are sent  by the people of Jerusalem, to Josephus, send greeting. We are sent by  the principal men of Jerusalem, who have heard that John of Gischala  hath laid many snares for thee, to rebuke him, and to exhort him to be  subject to thee hereafter. We are also desirous to consult with thee  about our common concerns, and what is fit to be done. We therefore  desire thee to come to us quickly, and to bring only a few men with  thee; for this village will not contain a great number of soldiers.\"  Thus it was that they wrote, as expecting one of these two things;  either that I should come without armed men, and then they should have  me wholly in their power; or, if I came with a great number, they should  judge me to be a public enemy. Now it was a horseman who brought the  letter, a man at other times bold, and one that had served in the army  under the king. It was the second hour of the night that he came, when  I was feasting with my friends, and the principal of the Galileans. This  man, upon my servant's telling me that a certain horseman of the Jewish  nation was come, was called in at my command, but did not so much as  salute me at all, but held out a letter, and said, \"This letter is sent  thee by those that are come from Jerusalem; do thou write an answer to  it quickly; for I am obliged to return to them very soon.\" Now my guests  could not but wonder at the boldness of the soldier. But I desired him  to sit down and sup with us; but when he refused so to do, I held the  letter in my hands as I received it, and fell a talking with my guests  about other matters. But a few hours afterwards, I got up, and when  I had dismissed the rest to go to their beds, I bid only four of my  intimate friends to stay, and ordered my servant to get some wine  ready. I also opened the letter so, that nobody could perceive it; and  understanding thereby presently the purportu of the writing, I sealed it  up again, and appeared as if I had not yet read it, but only held it in  my hands. I ordered twenty drachmae should be given the soldier for the  charges of his journey; and when he took the money, and said that he  thanked me for it, I perceived that he loved money, and that he was to  be caught chiefly by that means; and I said to him, \"If thou wilt but  drink with us, thou shalt have a drachma for every glass thou drinkest.\"  So he gladly embraced this proposal, and drank a great deal of wine, in  order to get the more money, and was so drunk, that at last he could not  keep the secrets he was intrusted with, but discovered them without my  putting questions to him, viz. That a treacherous design was contrived  against me, and that I was doomed to die by those that sent him. When I  heard this, I wrote back this answer: \"Josephus to Jonathan, and those  that are with him, sendeth greeting. Upon the information that you are  come in health into Galilee, I rejoice, and this especially because  I can now resign the care of public affairs here into your hands, and  return into my native country, which is what I have desired to do a  great while; and I confess I ought not only to come to you as far as  Xaloth, but farther, and this without your commands. But I desire you  to excuse me, because I cannot do it now, since I watch the motions of  Placidus, who hath a mind to go up into Galilee; and this I do here at  Chabolo. Do you therefore, on the receipt of this epistle, come hither  to me. Fare you well.\"    45. When I had written thus, and given the letter to be carried by  the soldier, I sent along with him thirty of the Galileans of the best  characters, and gave them instructions to salute those ambassadors,  but to say nothing else to them. I also gave orders to as many of those  armed men, whom I esteemed most faithful to me, to go along with the  others, every one with him whom he was to guard, lest some conversation  might pass between those whom I sent and those who were with Jonathan.  So those men went [to Jonathan]. But when Jonathan and his partners had  failed in this their first attempt, they sent me another letter, the  contents whereof were as follows: \"Jonathan, and those with him, to  Josephus, send greeting. We require thee to come to us to the village  Gabaroth, on the third day, without any armed men, that we may hear what  thou hast to lay to the charge of John [of Gischala].\" When they had  written this letter, they saluted the Galileans whom I sent, and came  to Japha, which was the largest village of all Galilee, and encompassed  with very strong walls, and had a great number of inhabitants in it.  There the multitude of men, with their wives and children, met them, and  exclaimed loudly against them; and desired them to be gone, and not to  envy them the advantage of an excellent commander. With these clamors  Jonathan and his partners were greatly provoked, although they durst not  show their anger openly; so they made them no answer, but went to other  villages. But still the same clamors met them from all the people, who  said, \"Nobody should persuade them to have any other commander besides  Josephus.\" So Jonathan and his partners went away from them without  success, and came to Sepphoris, the greatest city of all Galilee. Now  the men of that city, who inclined to the Romans in their sentiments,  met them indeed, but neither praised nor reproached me and when they  were gone down from Sepphoris to Asochis, the people of that place made  a clamor against them, as those of Japha had done; whereupon they were  able to contain themselves no longer, but ordered the armed men that  were with them to beat those that made the clamor with their clubs. And  when they came to Gabara, John met them with three thousand armed men;  but, as I understood by their letter that they had resolved to fight  against me, I arose from Chabolo, with three thousand armed men also;  but left in my camp one of my fastest friends, and came to Jotapata,  as desirous to be near them, the distance being no more than forty  furlongs. Whence I wrote thus to them: \"If you are very desirous that I  should come to you, you know there are two hundred and forty cities  and villages in Galilee; I will come to any of them which you please,  excepting Gaburn and Gischala; the one of which is John's native city,  and the other in confederacy and friendship with him.\"    46. When Jonathan and his partners had received this letter, they wrote  me no more answers, but called a council of their friends together; and  taking John into their consultation, they took counsel together by what  means they might attack me. John's opinion was, that they should write  to all the cities and villages that were in Galilee; for that there  must be certainly one or two persons in every one of them that were at  variance with me, and that they should be invited to come to oppose me  as an enemy. He would also have them send this resolution of theirs to  the city of Jerusalem, that its citizens, upon the knowledge of my  being adjudged to be an enemy by the Galileans, might themselves I also  confirm that determination. He said also, that when this was done, even  those Galileans who were well affected to me, would desert me out of  fear. When John had given them this counsel, what he had said was very  agreeable to the rest of them. I was also made acquainted with these  affairs about the third hour of the night, by the means of one Saccheus,  who had belonged to them, but now deserted them and came over to me,  and told me what they were about; so I perceived that no time was to be  lost. Accordingly, I gave command to Jacob, an armed man of my guard,  whom I esteemed faithful to me, to take two hundred men, and to guard  the passages that led from Gahara to Galilee, and to seize upon the  passengers, and send them to me, especially such as were caught with  letters about them: I also sent Jeremias himself, one of my friends,  with six hundred armed men, to the borders of Galilee, in order to watch  the roads that led from this country to the city Jerusalem, and gave him  charge to lay hold of such as traveled with letters about them, to keep  the men in bonds upon the place, but to send me the letters.    47. When I had laid these commands upon them, I gave them orders, and  bid them take their arms and bring three days' provision with them, and  be with me the next day. I also parted those that were about me into  four parts, and ordained those of them that were most faithful to me to  be a guard to my body. I also set over them centurions, and commanded  them to take care that not a soldier which they did not know should  mingle himself among them. Now, on the fifth day following, when I was  at Gabaroth, I found the entire plain that was before the village full  of armed men, who were come out of Galilee to assist me: many others of  the multitude, also, out of the village, ran along with me. But as soon  as I had taken my place, and began to speak to them, they all made an  acclamation, and called me the benefactor and savior of the country.  And when I had made them my acknowledgments, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#8)"],[1,"be about him,] after Abel was slain, and Cain fled  away, on account of his murder, was solicitous for posterity, and had a  vehement desire of children, he being two hundred and thirty years old;  after which time he lived other seven hundred, and then died. He had  indeed many other children,8 but Seth in particular. As for the rest, it  would be tedious to name them; I will therefore only endeavor to give an  account of those that proceeded from Seth. Now this Seth, when he was  brought up, and came to those years in which he could discern what was  good, became a virtuous man; and as he was himself of an excellent  character, so did he leave children behind him who imitated his  virtues.9 All these proved to be of good dispositions. They also  inhabited the same country without dissensions, and in a happy  condition, without any misfortunes falling upon them, till they died.  They also were the inventors of that peculiar sort of wisdom which is  concerned with the heavenly bodies, and their order. And that their  inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, upon  Adam's prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the  force of fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of  water, they made two pillars, 10 the one of brick, the other of stone:  they inscribed their discoveries on them both, that in case the pillar  of brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might  remain, and exhibit those discoveries to mankind; and also inform them  that there was another pillar of brick erected by them. Now this remains  in the land of Siriad to this day.              CHAPTER 3. Concerning The Flood; And After What Manner Noah Was Saved In  An Ark, With His Kindred, And Afterwards Dwelt In The Plain Of Shinar.    1. Now this posterity of Seth continued to esteem God as the Lord of the  universe, and to have an entire regard to virtue, for seven generations;  but in process of time they were perverted, and forsook the practices of  their forefathers; and did neither pay those honors to God which were  appointed them, nor had they any concern to do justice towards men. But  for what degree of zeal they had formerly shown for virtue, they now  showed by their actions a double degree of wickedness, whereby they made  God to be their enemy. For many angels11 of God accompanied with women,  and begat sons that proved unjust, and despisers of all that was good,  on account of the confidence they had in their own strength; for the  tradition is, that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom  the Grecians call giants. But Noah was very uneasy at what they did; and  being displeased at their conduct, persuaded them to change their  dispositions and their acts for the better: but seeing they did not  yield to him, but were slaves to their wicked pleasures, he was afraid  they would kill him, together with his wife and children, and those they  had married; so he departed out of that land.    2. Now God loved this man for his righteousness: yet he not only  condemned those other men for their wickedness, but determined to  destroy the whole race of mankind, and to make another race that should  be pure from wickedness; and cutting short their lives, and making their  years not so many as they formerly lived, but one hundred and twenty  only,12 he turned the dry land into sea; and thus were all these men  destroyed: but Noah alone was saved; for God suggested to him the  following contrivance and way of escape:That he should make an ark of  four stories high, three hundred cubits13 long, fifty cubits broad, and  thirty cubits high. Accordingly he entered into that ark, and his wife,  and sons, and their wives, and put into it not only other provisions, to  support their wants there, but also sent in with the rest all sorts of  living creatures, the male and his female, for the preservation of their  kinds; and others of them by sevens. Now this ark had firm walls, and a  roof, and was braced with cross beams, so that it could not be any way  drowned or overborne by the violence of the water. And thus was Noah,  with his family, preserved. Now he was the tenth from Adam, as being the  son of Lamech, whose father was Mathusela; he was the son of Enoch, the  son of Jared; and Jared was the son of Malaleel, who, with many of his  sisters, were the children of Cainan, the son of Enos. Now Enos was the  son of Seth, the son of Adam.    3. This calamity happened in the six hundredth year of Noah's  government, [age,] in the second month, 14 called by the Macedonians  Dius, but by the Hebrews Marchesuan: for so did they order their year in  Egypt. But Moses appointed that ú Nisan, which is the same with  Xanthicus, should be the first month for their festivals, because he  brought them out of Egypt in that month: so that this month began the  year as to all the solemnities they observed to the honor of God,  although he preserved the original order of the months as to selling and  buying, and other ordinary affairs. Now he says that this flood began on  the twenty-seventh [seventeenth] day of the forementioned month; and  this was two thousand six hundred and fifty-six [one thousand six  hundred and fifty-six] years from Adam, the first man; and the time is  written down in our sacred books, those who then lived having noted  down,[15] with great accuracy, both the births and deaths of illustrious  men.    4. For indeed Seth was born when Adam was in his two hundred and  thirtieth year, who lived nine hundred and thirty years. Seth begat Enos  in his two hundred and fifth year; who, when he had lived nine hundred  and twelve years, delivered the government to Cainan his son, whom he  had in his hundred and ninetieth year. He lived nine hundred and five  years. Cainan, when he had lived nine hundred and ten years, had his son  Malaleel, who was born in his hundred and seventieth year. This  Malaleel, having lived eight hundred and ninety-five years, died,  leaving his son Jared, whom he begat when he was in his hundred and  sixty-fifth year. He lived nine hundred and sixty-two years; and then  his son Enoch succeeded him, who was born when his father was one  hundred and sixty-two years old. Now he, when he had lived three hundred  and sixty-five years, departed and went to God; whence it is that they  have not written down his death. Now Mathusela, the son of Enoch, who  was born to him when he was one hundred and sixty-five years old, had  Lamech for his son when he was one hundred and eighty-seven years of  age; to whom he delivered the government, when he had retained it nine  hundred and sixty-nine years. Now Lamech, when he had governed seven  hundred and seventy-seven years, appointed Noah, his son, to be ruler of  the people, who was born to Lamech when he was one hundred and eighty-  two years old, and retained the government nine hundred and fifty years.  These years collected together make up the sum before set down. But let  no one inquire into the deaths of these men; for they extended their  lives along together with their children and grandchildren; but let him  have regard to their births only.15    5. When God gave the signal, and it began to rain, the water poured down  forty entire days, till it became fifteen cubits higher than the earth;  which was the reason why there was no greater number preserved, since  they had no place to fly to. When the rain ceased, the water did but  just begin to abate after one hundred and fifty days, [that is, on the  seventeenth day of the seventh month,] it then ceasing to subside for a  little while. After this, the ark rested on the top of a certain  mountain in Armenia; which, when Noah understood, he opened it; and  seeing a small piece of land about it, he continued quiet, and conceived  some cheerful hopes of deliverance. But a few days afterward, when the  water was decreased to a greater degree, he sent out a raven, as  desirous to learn whether any other part of the earth were left dry by  the water, and whether he might go out of the ark with safety; but the  raven, finding all the land still overflowed, returned to Noah again.  And after seven days he sent out a dove, to know the state of the  ground; which came back to him covered with mud, and bringing an olive  branch: hereby Noah learned that the earth was become clear of the  flood. So after he had staid seven more days, he sent the living  creatures out of the ark; and both he and his family went out, when he  also sacrificed to God, and feasted with his companions. However, the  Armenians call this place, [GREEK] 16 The Place of Descent; for the ark  being saved in that place, its remains are shown there by the  inhabitants to this day.    6. Now all the writers of barbarian histories make mention of this  flood, and of this ark; among whom is Berosus the Chaldean. For when he  is describing the circumstances of the flood, he goes on thus: \"It is  said there is still some part of this ship in Armenia, at the mountain  of the Cordyaeans; and that some people carry off pieces of the bitumen,  which they take away, and use chiefly as amulets for the averting of  mischiefs.\" Hieronymus the Egyptian also, who wrote the Phoenician  Antiquities, and Mnaseas, and a great many more, make mention of the  same. Nay, Nicolaus of Damascus, in his ninety-sixth book, hath a  particular relation about them; where he speaks thus: \"There is a great  mountain in Armenia, over Minyas, called Baris, upon which it is  reported that many who fled at the time of the Deluge were saved; and  that one who was carried in an ark came on shore upon the top of it; and  that the remains of the timber were a great while preserved. This might  be the man about whom Moses the legislator of the Jews wrote.\"    7. But as for Noah, he was afraid, since God had determined to destroy  mankind, lest he should drown the earth every year; so he offered burnt-  offerings, and"]]]
