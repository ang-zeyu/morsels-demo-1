[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#8)"],[1,"the canal turns a little to  the left, and thereupon becomes more quiet, the main bustle of the  water-street being usually confined to the first straight reach of it,  some quarter of a mile long, the Cheapside of Murano. We pass a  considerable church on the left, St. Pietro, and a little square  opposite to it with a few acacia trees, and then find our boat suddenly  seized by a strong green eddy, and whirled into the tide-way of one of  the main channels of the lagoon, which divides the town of Murano into  two parts by a deep stream some fifty yards over, crossed only by one  wooden bridge. We let ourselves drift some way down the current, looking  at the low line of cottages on the other side of it, hardly knowing if  there be more cheerfulness or melancholy in the way the sunshine glows  on their ruinous but whitewashed walls, and sparkles on the rushing of  the green water by the grass-grown quay. It needs a strong stroke of the  oar to bring us into the mouth of another quiet canal on the farther  side of the tide-way, and we are still somewhat giddy when we run the  head of the gondola into the sand on the left-hand side of this more  sluggish stream, and land under the east end of the Church of San  Donato, the \"Matrice\" or \"Mother\" Church of Murano.    Sec. VII. It stands, it and the heavy campanile detached from it a few  yards, in a small triangular field of somewhat fresher grass than is  usual near Venice, traversed by a paved walk with green mosaic of short  grass between the rude squares of its stones, bounded on one side by  ruinous garden walls, on another by a line of low cottages, on the  third, the base of the triangle, by the shallow canal from which we have  just landed. Near the point of the triangular space is a simple well,  bearing date 1502; in its widest part, between the canal and campanile,  is a four-square hollow pillar, each side formed by a separate slab of  stone, to which the iron hasps are still attached that once secured the  Venetian standard.    The cathedral itself occupies the northern angle of the field,  encumbered with modern buildings, small outhouse-like chapels, and  wastes of white wall with blank square windows, and itself utterly  defaced in the whole body of it, nothing but the apse having been  spared; the original plan is only discoverable by careful examination,  and even then but partially. The whole impression and effect of the  building are irretrievably lost, but the fragments of it are still most  precious.    We must first briefly state what is known of its history.    Sec. VIII. The legends of the Romish Church, though generally more insipid  and less varied than those of Paganism, deserve audience from us on this  ground, if on no other, that they have once been sincerely believed by  good men, and have had no ineffective agency in the foundation of the  existent European mind. The reader must not therefore accuse me of  trifling, when I record for him the first piece of information I have  been able to collect respecting the cathedral of Murano: namely, that  the emperor Otho the Great, being overtaken by a storm on the Adriatic,  vowed, if he were preserved, to build and dedicate a church to the  Virgin, in whatever place might be most pleasing to her; that the storm  thereupon abated; and the Virgin appearing to Otho in a dream showed  him, covered with red lilies, that very triangular field on which we  were but now standing, amidst the ragged weeds and shattered pavement.  The emperor obeyed the vision; and the church was consecrated on the  15th of August, 957.    Sec. IX. Whatever degree of credence we may feel disposed to attach to  this piece of history, there is no question that a church was built on  this spot before the close of the tenth century: since in the year 999  we find the incumbent of the Basilica (note this word, it is of some  importance) di Santa Maria Plebania di Murano taking an oath of  obedience to the Bishop of the Altinat church, and engaging at the same  time to give the said bishop his dinner on the Domenica in Albis, when  the prelate held a confirmation in the mother church, as it was then  commonly called, of Murano. From this period, for more than a century, I  can find no records of any alterations made in the fabric of the church,  but there exist very full details of the quarrels which arose between  its incumbents and those of San Stefano, San Cipriano, San Salvatore,  and the other churches of Murano, touching the due obedience which their  less numerous or less ancient brotherhoods owed to St. Mary's.    These differences seem to have been renewed at the election of every new  abbot by each of the fraternities, and must have been growing serious  when the patriarch of Grado, Henry Dandolo, interfered in 1102, and, in  order to seal a peace between the two principal opponents, ordered that  the abbot of St. Stephen's should be present at the service in St.  Mary's on the night of the Epiphany, and that the abbot of St. Mary's  should visit him of St. Stephen's on St. Stephen's day; and that then  the two abbots \"should eat apples and drink good wine together, in peace  and charity.\"[10]    Sec. X. But even this kindly effort seems to have been without result: the  irritated pride of the antagonists remained unsoothed by the love-feast  of St. Stephen's day; and the breach continued to widen until the abbot  of St. Mary's obtained a timely accession to his authority in the year  1125. The Doge Domenico Michele, having in the second crusade secured  such substantial advantages for the Venetians as might well  counterbalance the loss of part of their trade with the East, crowned  his successes by obtaining possession in Cephalonia of the body of St.  Donato, bishop of Euroea; which treasure he having presented on his  return to the Murano basilica, that church was thenceforward called the  church of Sts. Mary and Donato. Nor was the body of the saint its only  acquisition: St. Donato's principal achievement had been the destruction  of a terrible dragon in Epirus; Michele brought home the bones of the  dragon as well as of the saint; the latter were put in a marble  sarcophagus, and the former hung up over the high altar.    Sec. XI. But the clergy of St. Stefano were indomitable. At the very  moment when their adversaries had received this formidable accession of  strength, they had the audacity \"ad onta de' replicati giuramenti, e  dell'inveterata consuetudine,\"[11] to refuse to continue in the  obedience which they had vowed to their mother church. The matter was  tried in a provincial council; the votaries of St. Stephen were  condemned, and remained quiet for about twenty years, in wholesome dread  of the authority conferred on the abbot of St. Donate, by the Pope's  legate, to suspend any o the clergy of the island from their office if  they refused submission. In 1172, however, they appealed to Pope  Alexander III, and were condemned again: and we find the struggle  renewed at every promising opportunity, during the course of the 12th  and 13th centuries; until at last, finding St. Donate and the dragon  together too strong for him, the abbot of St. Stefano \"discovered\" in  his church the bodies of two hundred martyrs at once!--a discovery, it  is to be remembered, in some sort equivalent in those days to that of  California in ours. The inscription, however, on the facade of the  church, recorded it with quiet dignity:--\"MCCCLXXIV. a di XIV. di  Aprile. Furono trovati nella presente chiesa del protomartire San  Stefano, duecento e piu corpi de' Santi Martiri, dal Ven. Prete Matteo  Fradello, piovano della chiesa.\"[12] Corner, who gives this inscription,  which no longer exists, goes on to explain with infinite gravity, that  the bodies in question, \"being of infantile form and stature, are  reported by tradition to have belonged to those fortunate innocents who  suffered martyrdom under King Herod; but that when, or by whom, the  church was enriched with so vast a treasure, is not manifested by any  document.\"[13]    Sec. XII. The issue of the struggle is not to our present purpose. We have  already arrived at the fourteenth century without finding record of any  effort made by the clergy of St. Mary's to maintain their influence by  restoring or beautifying their basilica; which is the only point at  present of importance to us. That great alterations were made in it at  the time of the acquisition of the body of St. Donato is however highly  probable, the mosaic pavement of the interior, which bears its date  inscribed, 1140, being probably the last of the additions. I believe  that no part of the ancient church can be shown to be of more recent  date than this; and I shall not occupy the reader's time by any inquiry  respecting the epochs or authors of the destructive modern restorations;  the wreck of the old fabric, breaking out beneath them here and there,  is generally distinguishable from them at a glance; and it is enough for  the reader to know that none of these truly ancient fragments can be  assigned to a more recent date than 1140, and that some of them may with  probability be looked upon as remains of the shell of the first church,  erected in the course of the latter half of the tenth century. We shall  perhaps obtain some further reason for this belief as we examine these  remains themselves.    Sec. XIII. Of the body of the church, unhappily, they are few and obscure;  but the general form and extent of the building, as shown in the plan,  Plate I. fig. 2, are determined, first, by the breadth of the uninjured  east end D E; secondly, by some remains of the original brickwork of the  clerestory, and in all probability of the side walls also, though these  have been refaced; and finally by the series of nave shafts, which are  still perfect. The doors A and B may or may not be in their original  positions; there must of course have been always, as now, a principal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#8)"],[1,"of Byzantine Renaissance.\"      [4] In the various works which Mr. Prout has written on light and      shade, no principle will be found insisted on more strongly than      this carrying of the dark into the light, and _vice versa_. It is      curious to find the untaught instinct of a merely picturesque artist      in the nineteenth century, fixing itself so intensely on a principle      which regulated the entire sacred composition of the thirteenth. I      say \"untaught\" instinct, for Mr. Prout was, throughout his life, the      discoverer of his own principles; fortunately so, considering what      principles were taught in his time, but unfortunately in the      abstract, for there were gifts in him, which, had there been any      wholesome influences to cherish them, might have made him one of the      greatest men of his age. He was great, under all adverse      circumstances, but the mere wreck of what he might have been, if,      after the rough training noticed in my pamphlet on Pre-Raphaelitism,      as having fitted him for his great function in the world, he had met      with a teacher who could have appreciated his powers, and directed      them.      [5] There may, however, be a kind of dishonesty even in the use of      marble, if it is attempted to make the marble look like something      else. See the final or Venetian Index under head \"Scalzi.\"      [6] Appendix 5, \"Renaissance Side of Ducal Palace.\"      [7] We have, as far as I _know_, at present among us, only one      painter, G. F. Watts, who is capable of design in color on a large      scale. He stands alone among our artists of the old school, in his      perception of the value of breadth in distant masses, and in the      vigor of invention by which such breadth must be sustained; and his      power of expression and depth of thought are not less remarkable      than his bold conception of color effect. Very probably some of the      Pre-Raphaelites have the gift also; I am nearly certain that Rosetti      has it, and I think also Millais; but the experiment has yet to be      tried. I wish it could be made in Mr. Hope's church in Margaret      Street.          CHAPTER II.    ROMAN RENAISSANCE.      Sec. I. Of all the buildings in Venice, later in date than the final  additions to the Ducal Palace, the noblest is, beyond all question, that  which, having been condemned by its proprietor, not many years ago, to  be pulled down and sold for the value of its materials, was rescued by  the Austrian government, and appropriated--the government officers  having no other use for it--to the business of the Post-Office; though  still known to the gondolier by its ancient name, the Casa Grimani. It  is composed of three stories of the Corinthian order, at once simple,  delicate, and sublime; but on so colossal a scale, that the  three-storied palaces on its right and left only reach to the cornice  which marks the level of its first floor. Yet it is not at first  perceived to be so vast; and it is only when some expedient is employed  to hide it from the eye, that by the sudden dwarfing of the whole reach  of the Grand Canal, which it commands, we become aware that it is to the  majesty of the Casa Grimani that the Rialto itself, and the whole group  of neighboring buildings, owe the greater part of their impressiveness.  Nor is the finish of its details less notable than the grandeur of their  scale. There is not an erring line, nor a mistaken proportion,  throughout its noble front; and the exceeding fineness of the chiselling  gives an appearance of lightness to the vast blocks of stone out of  whose perfect union that front is composed. The decoration is sparing,  but delicate: the first story only simpler than the rest, in that it has  pilasters instead of shafts, but all with Corinthian capitals, rich in  leafage, and fruited delicately; the rest of the walls flat and smooth,  and the mouldings sharp and shallow, so that the bold shafts look like  crystals of beryl running through a rock of quartz.    Sec. II. This palace is the principal type at Venice, and one of the best  in Europe, of the central architecture of the Renaissance schools; that  carefully studied and perfectly executed architecture to which those  schools owe their principal claims to our respect, and which became the  model of most of the important works subsequently produced by civilized  nations. I have called it the Roman Renaissance, because it is founded,  both in its principles of superimposition, and in the style of its  ornament, upon the architecture of classic Rome at its best period. The  revival of Latin literature both led to its adoption, and directed its  form; and the most important example of it which exists is the modern  Roman basilica of St. Peter's. It had, at its Renaissance or new birth,  no resemblance either to Greek, Gothic, or Byzantine forms, except in  retaining the use of the round arch, vault, and dome; in the treatment  of all details, it was exclusively Latin; the last links of connexion  with mediaeval tradition having been broken by its builders in their  enthusiasm for classical art, and the forms of true Greek or Athenian  architecture being still unknown to them. The study of these noble Greek  forms has induced various modifications of the Renaissance in our own  times; but the conditions which are found most applicable to the uses of  modern life are still Roman, and the entire style may most fitly be  expressed by the term \"Roman Renaissance.\"    Sec. III. It is this style, in its purity and fullest form,--represented  by such buildings as the Casa Grimani at Venice (built by San Micheli),  the Town Hall at Vicenza (by Palladio), St. Peter's at Rome (by Michael  Angelo), St. Paul's and Whitehall in London (by Wren and Inigo  Jones),--which is the true antagonist of the Gothic school. The  intermediate, or corrupt conditions of it, though multiplied over  Europe, are no longer admired by architects, or made the subjects of  their study; but the finished work of this central school is still, in  most cases, the model set before the student of the nineteenth century,  as opposed to those Gothic, Romanesque, or Byzantine forms which have  long been considered barbarous, and are so still by most of the leading  men of the day. That they are, on the contrary, most noble and  beautiful, and that the antagonistic Renaissance is, in the main,  unworthy and unadmirable, whatever perfection of a certain kind it may  possess, it was my principal purpose to show, when I first undertook the  labor of this work. It has been attempted already to put before the  reader the various elements which unite in the Nature of Gothic, and to  enable him thus to judge, not merely of the beauty of the forms which  that system has produced already, but of its future applicability to the  wants of mankind, and endless power over their hearts. I would now  endeavor, in like manner, to set before the reader the Nature of  Renaissance, and thus to enable him to compare the two styles under the  same light, and with the same enlarged view of their relations to the  intellect, and capacities for the service, of man.    Sec. IV. It will not be necessary for me to enter at length into any  examination of its external form. It uses, whether for its roofs of  aperture or roofs proper, the low gable or circular arch: but it differs  from Romanesque work in attaching great importance to the horizontal  lintel or architrave _above_ the arch; transferring the energy of the  principal shafts to the supporting of this horizontal beam, and thus  rendering the arch a subordinate, if not altogether a superfluous,  feature. The type of this arrangement has been given already at _c_,  Fig. XXXVI., p. 145, Vol. I.: and I might insist at length upon the  absurdity of a construction in which the shorter shaft, which has the  real weight of wall to carry, is split into two by the taller one, which  has nothing to carry at all,--that taller one being strengthened,  nevertheless, as if the whole weight of the building bore upon it; and  on the ungracefulness, never conquered in any Palladian work, of the two  half-capitals glued, as it were, against the slippery round sides of the  central shaft. But it is not the form of this architecture against which  I would plead. Its defects are shared by many of the noblest forms of  earlier building, and might have been entirely atoned for by excellence  of spirit. But it is the moral nature of it which is corrupt, and which  it must, therefore, be our principal business to examine and expose.    Sec. V. The moral, or immoral, elements which unite to form the spirit  of Central Renaissance architecture are, I believe, in the main,  two,--Pride and Infidelity; but the pride resolves itself into three  main branches,--Pride of Science, Pride of State, and Pride of System:  and thus we have four separate mental conditions which must be examined  successively.    Sec. VI. 1. PRIDE OF SCIENCE. It would have been more charitable, but more  confusing, to have added another element to our list, namely the _Love_  of Science; but the love is included in the pride, and is usually so  very subordinate an element that it does not deserve equality of  nomenclature. But, whether pursued in pride or in affection (how far by  either we shall see presently), the first notable characteristic of the  Renaissance central school is its introduction of accurate knowledge  into all its work, so far as it possesses such knowledge; and its  evident conviction, that such science is necessary to the excellence of  the work, and is the first thing to be expressed therein. So that all  the forms introduced, even in its minor ornament, are studied with the  utmost care; the anatomy of all animal structure is thoroughly  understood and elaborately expressed, and the whole of the execution  skilful and practised in the highest degree.
