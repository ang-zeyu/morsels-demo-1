However, be that as it       may, I have opened an office on Earth with the laudable purpose of       effecting an interchange of respective literatures, to see which       Terrestrial books might most profitably be translated into Fizbian,       and which of the authors on our own list might have potential       appeal for the Earth reader._         _Dealing with authors is, of course, a nerve-racking business and I       soon found myself in dire need of mental treatment. What was my       horror to find that this primitive, although charming, planet had       no neurotones, no psychoscopes, not even any cerebrophones--in       fact, no psychiatric machines at all! The very knowledge of this       brought me several degrees closer to a breakdown._         _Perhaps I should have consulted you at this juncture, but I admit       I was a bit of a snob. \"What sort of advice can a mere journalist       give me,\" I thought, \"that I could not give myself?\" So, more for       amusement than anything else, I determined to consult a native       practitioner. \"After all,\" I said to myself, \"a good laugh is a       step forward on the road to recovery.\"_         _Accordingly, I went to see this native fellow. They work entirely       without machines, I understand, using something like witchcraft. At       the same time, I thought I might pick up some material for a jolly       little book on primitive customs which I could get some unknown       writer to throw together inexpensively. Strong human interest items       like that always have great reader-appeal._         _The native chap--doctor, he calls himself--was most cordial,       which he should have been at the price I was paying him. One thing       I must say about these natives--backward they may be, but they have       a very shrewd commercial sense. You can't even imagine the trouble       I had getting those authors to sign even remotely reasonable       contracts ... which in part accounts for my mental disturbance,       I suppose._         _Well, anyway, I handed the native a privacy waiver carefully       filled out in Terran. He took it, smiled and said, \"We'll discuss       this afterward. My contact lenses have disappeared; I suppose one       of my patients has stolen them again. Can't see a thing without       them.\"_         _So we sat down and had a bit of a chat. He seemed remarkably       intelligent for a native; never interrupted me once._         _\"You are definitely in great trouble,\" he told me when I'd       finished. \"You need to be psycho-analyzed.\"_         _\"Good, good,\" I said. \"I see I've come to the right shop.\"_         _\"Now just lie down and make yourself comfortable.\"_         _\"Lie down?\" I repeated, puzzled. I have an excellent command of       Terran, but every now and then an idiom will throw me. \"I tell the       truth, sir, and when I am required by force of circumstances to       lie, I lie up.\"_         _\"No,\" he said, \"not that kind of lying. You know, the kind you do       at night when you go to sleep.\"_         _\"Oh, I get you,\" I said idiomatically. Without further ado, I       flung off my ulster and flew up to a thingummy hanging from the       ceiling--chandelier, I believe, is the native term--flipped upside       down, and hung from it by my toes. Wasn't the Presidential Perch,       by any means, but it wasn't bad at all. \"What do I do next?\" I       inquired affably._         _\"My dear fellow,\" the chap said, whipping out a notebook from the       recesses of his costume, \"how long have you had this delusion that       you are a bird--or is it a bat?\"_         _\"Sir,\" I said as haughtily as my position permitted, \"I am neither       a bird nor a bat. I am a Fizbian. Surely you have heard of       Fizbians?\"_         _\"Yes, yes, of course. They come from another country or planet or       something. Frankly, politics is a bit outside my sphere. All I'm       interested in is people--and Fizbians are people, aren't they?\"_         _\"Yes, certainly. If anything, it's you who.... Yes, they are       people.\"_         _\"Well, tell me then, Mr. Liznig, when was it you first started       thinking you were a bat or a bird?\"_         _I tried to control myself. \"I am neither a bird nor a bat! I am a       Fizbian! I have wings! See?\" I fluttered them._         _He peered at me. \"I wish I could,\" he said regretfully. \"Without       my glasses, though, I'm as blind as a bat--or a bird.\"_         _Well, the long and the short of it is that the natives are       planning to certify me as insane and incarcerate me, pending the       doctor's decision as to whether my delusion is that I am a bird or       a bat. They are using my privacy waiver as commitment papers._         _Save me, Senbot Drosmig, for I feel that if I have to wait for the       doctor's glasses to be delivered, I shall indeed go mad._         _Distractedly yours,_         _Tgos Liznig_    \"I'll handle this myself,\" Stet said crisply. \"I'll tell the consul to  advise the Terran State Department that this man should be deported as  an undesirable alien. That'll solve the problem neatly. We can't have  this contaminating the pure stream of Terrestrial literature with--\"    \"But aren't you going to explain to them that he's perfectly sane?\" Tarb  gasped.    \"No need to bother. He'll be grateful enough to get off the planet.  Besides, how do I know he is perfectly sane?\"    \"Stet Zarnon, you're perfectly horrid!\"    \"And you, Tarb Morfatch, are disgustingly drunk. Now you go right home  and sleep it off. I know I was too harsh with you--my fault for letting  you go out alone with Griblo in the first place when you've been here  only a few months. Might have known those Terran journalists would lead  you astray. Nice fellows, but irresponsible.\" He flicked out his tongue.  \"There, I've apologized. Now will you go home?\"    \"Home!\" Tarb shrieked. \"Home when there's work to be done and--\"    \"--and you're not going to be the one to do it. Tarb,\" he said,  attempting to seize her foot, which she pulled away, \"I was going to  tell you tomorrow, but you might as well know tonight. I've taken you  off the column for good. I have a better job for you.\"    She looked at him. \"A better job? Are you being sarcastic? What as?\"    \"As my wife.\" He got up and came over to her. She stood still, almost  stunned. \"That solves the whole problem tidily. An office is no place  for you, darling--you're really a simple home-girl at heart. Newspaper  work is too strenuous for you; it upsets you and makes you nervous and  irritable. I want you to stay home and take care of our house and hatch  our eggs--unostentatiously, of course.\"    \"Why, you--\" she spluttered.    He put his foot over her mouth. \"Don't give me your answer now. You're  in no condition to think. Tell me tomorrow.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It rained all night and continued on into the morning. Tarb's head  ached, but she had to make an appearance at the office. First she vizzed  an acquaintance she had made the day before; then she took her umbrella  and set forth.    As she kicked open the door to the newsroom, all sound ceased. Voices  stopped abruptly. Typewriters halted in mid-click. Even the roar of the  presses downstairs suddenly seemed to mute. Every head turned to look at  Tarb.    _Humph_, she thought, removing her plastic oversocks, _so suppose I was  a little oblique yesterday. They needn't stare at me. They never stare  at Drosmig. Just because I'm a woman, I suppose!_ The gate crashed  loudly behind her.    \"Oh, Miss Morfatch,\" Miss Snow called. \"Mr. Zarnon said he wanted to  see you as soon as you came in. It's urgent.\" And she giggled.    \"Really?\" Tarb said. \"Well, he'll just have to wait until I've wrung out  my wings.\" Sooner or later, she would have to face Stet, but she wanted  to put it off as long as possible.    She opened the door to her office and halted in amazement. For, seated  on a stool behind the desk, haggard but vertical, was Senbot Drosmig,  busily reading letters and blue-penciling comments on them with his  feet.    \"Good morning, my dear,\" he said, giving her a wan smile. \"Surprised to  see me functioning again, eh?\"    \"Well--yes.\" She opened her dripping umbrella mechanically and stood it  in a corner. \"How--\"    \"I realized last night that all that happened to you was my fault. You  were my responsibility and I failed you.\"    \"Oh, don't be melodramatic, Senbot. I wasn't your responsibility and you  didn't fail me. Not that I'm not glad to see you up and doing again,  but--\"    \"But I did fail you!\" the aged journalist insisted. \"And, in the same  way, I failed my people. I shouldn't have given in. I should have fought  Zarnon as you, my dear, tried to do. But it isn't too late!\" The fire of  the crusader lit up in his watery old eyes. \"I can still fight him and  his sacred crows--his Earthlings! If I have to, I can go over his head  to Grupe. Grupe may not understand Stet's moral failings, but he  certainly will comprehend his commercial ones.

He went  first to Worms and then to Mayence, remaining some length of time  in both places.  He was moved to the step, not by taste for  travel, but by taste for study, in accordance with the custom of  his time, by which a student went from school to school in order  to complete his knowledge.  Of old, it was customary for the  workman to make the tour of France for the purpose of perfecting  himself in his trade and finding out the different processes of  manufacture.  Similarly, the student went from city to city, or,  remaining in the same place, from school to school, in order to  study a different subject under each master according to the  manuscripts which the particular master happened to possess, and  which he made his pupils copy.  So far from being disqualified  from entering a school on account of vagabondage, the stranger  student was accorded a warm welcome, especially if he was himself  a scholar.  Strangers found open hospitality in the community,  and were sometimes taken in by the master himself.  Knowledge and  love of knowledge were safe-conducts.  In every city the lettered  new-comer found hosts and friends.    Rashi probably stood in need of such hospitality and protection,  for, if an obscure remark made by him may be relied upon, his  life as a student was not free from care, and he must have  suffered all sorts of privations.  Nor was it rare that fortune  failed to smile upon the students, and-not to give a list of  examples-cases of poverty were fairly frequent in the Christian  universities, at which mendicancy itself was almost respectable.  The temptation might be legitimate to sentimentalize over this  love of knowledge, this zeal for work, as they manifested  themselves in Rashi, causing him to brave all the evil strokes of  fortune for their sake; but one must strain a point to take him  literally when he says, as he does in a certain somewhat involved  passage, that he studied \"without nourishment and without  garments.\" However that may be, the same passage shows that while  still a student whose course was but half completed, he married,  in conformity with the Talmudic maxim, which recommends the Jew  to marry at eighteen years of age.  From time to time he went to  visit his family at Troyes, always returning to Worms or Mayence.    The fact that the academies of Lorraine which Rashi frequented  were in his day the great centres of Talmudic learning, is due to  the happy lot which the Jews enjoyed in that country.  The chief  trading route of Europe at that time connected Italy with Rhenish  Germany, and the Jews knew how to render themselves indispensable  in the traffic along this route.  Moreover, they lived on good  terms with their neighbors.  The explanation of the cordial  relations between Jews and Christians lies in the ease with which  the Jews rose to the level of general culture.  The architecture  of their synagogues is a striking example.  The cathedral of  Worms was built in 1034, at the same period as the synagogue  there.  The two structures display so many similarities that one  is tempted to believe they represent the handiwork of the same  builders.  At all events, it is clear that the Jews cultivated  the Romanesque style, so majestic in its simplicity.[15]    Lorraine was not at that time a province of the German Empire;  and Rashi leaving the banks of the Seine for those of the Rhine  did not expatriate himself in the true sense of the word.  Lorraine, or, as it was then called, Lotharingia, the country of  Lothair (this is the name that occurs in the rabbinical sources),  was more than half French.  Situated between France and Germany,  it came within the sphere of French influence.  French was the  language in current use, spoken by Jew and Christian alike.  German words, in fact, were gallicized in pronunciation.  In  Rashi's day the barons of Lorraine rendered homage to the king of  France, Henry I.  Naturally, then, the Jews of Lorraine and those  of Northern France were in close intellectual communion.  The  academies along the Rhine and the Moselle formed, as it were, the  link between France and Germany.  In general, and despite the  rarity and difficulty of communication, the Jews of France,  Germany, and Italy entered freely into relations with one  another.[16]    No testimony exists to prove that Rashi, as has been said,  studied at Speyer, at which, without doubt, R. Eliakim had not  yet begun to teach.  Possibly, Rashi did go to Germany, if  confidence is to be placed in some information he gives  concerning \"the country of Ashkenaz,\" and if the fact may be  deduced from the occurrence in his commentaries of some dozen  German words, the authenticity of which is not always certain.    Though doubt may attach to Rashi's journeys, it is certain that  Rashi passed the larger number of his years of study (about 1055-  1065) in Worms.  For a long time it was thought-and the belief  still obtains-that he also gave instruction in Worms; and  recently a street in the city was named after him.  Tradition has  connected many things with this alleged stay of Rashi as rabbi at  Worms.  Even in our days visitors are shown the school and the  little synagogue attached to it as recalling his sojourn in the  place, and a small building touching the eastern wall of the  great synagogue is also supposed to perpetuate his memory, and it  is still called the \"Rashi Chapel.\"  At the bottom of the wall a  recess is visible, miraculously caused in order to save his  mother when her life was endangered by the two carriages.[17]  Some say that Rashi taught from this niche, and a seat in it,  raised on three steps, called the Rashi Chair, is still pointed  out.    These traditions do not merit credence.  Moreover, they are of  comparatively recent origin.  For a long time the school bore the  name, not of Rashi, but of Eleazar of Worms, and it was not built  until the beginning of the thirteenth century.  Destroyed in  1615, it was restored in 1720 through the generosity of Loeb  Sinzheim, of Vienna, and at present it is the Jewish hospital.  Alongside the school was a little chapel, belonging to it, which  was destroyed in 1615, restored several years later, and finally  burned by the French in 1689.  The other chapel, the so-called  \"Rashi Chapel,\" his Yeshibah (school), is so tiny that it could  hardly have held the crowd of hearers who thronged there, as  tradition has it, in order to listen to him.  Besides, the  building did not bear the name of Rashi when in 1623 David Joshua  Oppenheim, head of the community, erected the school and  adjoining chapel, as a Hebrew inscription in the southern wall of  the chapel declares.  The chapel having lost its utility was  closed in 1760, and from this time on it has been consecrated to  the memory of Rashi.  It was restored in 1855.    At Worms Rashi first studied under the head of the Talmudic  academy there, Jacob ben Yakar, by that time a man well on in  years.  His age doubtless explains the respect and veneration  paid him, to which his disciple gave touching expression.  But we  know besides how sincere was his piety, his humility, and his  spirit of self-denial.  One day a Christian delivered several  tuns [tons sic] of wine to a Jew of Worms under peculiar  conditions.  Jacob did not want to decide so complicated and  delicate a question, and he fled.  Rashi and another disciple  pursued and overtook him.  Then he authorized the use of the  wine.    Once when the community was going to pay its respects to the  emperor or the governor, Jacob declined the honor of heading the  procession.  \"I am nothing but a poor man,\" he said.  \"Let others  bring their money, I can offer only my prayers.  Each should give  of that which he has.\"  Other characteristics of his are  mentioned.  Once he and his colleague, Eliezer, surnamed the  Great, took an animal they had bought to the slaughter house.  There it was found that there was an imperfection in its body;  according to Eliezer the imperfection rendered it unfit for  eating; according to Jacob it was of no importance.  The animal  having been divided, Eliezer threw his share away.  Then Jacob  did the same, saying that he would not eat the meat of an animal  when another denied himself the enjoyment of it.  Later it is  told of Jacob that in his humility he swept the floor of the  synagogue with his beard.  To cite Rashi himself, \"I never  protest against the usages in the school of my master, Jacob ben  Yakar: I know that he possessed the finest qualities.  He  considered himself a worm which is trodden underfoot, and he  never arrogated to himself the honor-though he would have been  justified in so doing-of having introduced any innovation  whatsoever.\"    It seems that Rashi, who spoke of Jacob ben Yakar with the utmost  respect, and called him \"my old master,\" studied not only the  Talmud but also the Bible under his guidance.    The scholar who desired to obtain a grasp on all the studies, if  not in their full content, at least in all their variety, had to  devote many years to study at a school, not necessarily the same  school, throughout his student years, for since the celebrity of  a school depended upon the knowledge and renown of its head, it  gained and lost pupils with its master.    Thus, on the death of Jacob ben Yakar, Rashi studied under the  guidance of his successor, Isaac ben Eleazar ha-Levi,[18] though  not for long, it seems.  Wishing in a way to complete the cycle  of instruction, he went to Mayence, the centre [center sic] of  great Talmudic activity.  The school here was directed by Isaac  ben Judah (about 1050-1080), sometimes called the \"Frenchman.\"  Rashi considered Isaac ben Judah his master <I>par  excellence.</I>  In this school were composed the Talmudic  commentaries "]]]
