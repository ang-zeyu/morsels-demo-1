[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24968"],[0,"Behind the Scenes (#8)"],[1,".\"    With a nervous step I passed on, and knocked at Mrs. Lincoln's door. A  cheery voice bade me come in, and a lady, inclined to stoutness, about  forty years of age, stood before me.    \"You are Lizzie Keckley, I believe.\"    I bowed assent.    \"The dress-maker that Mrs. McClean recommended?\"    \"Yes, madam.\"    \"Very well; I have not time to talk to you now, but would like to have  you call at the White House, at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, where I  shall then be.\"    I bowed myself out of the room, and returned to my apartments. The day  passed slowly, for I could not help but speculate in relation to the  appointed interview for the morrow. My long-cherished hope was about to  be realized, and I could not rest.    Tuesday morning, at eight o'clock, I crossed the threshold of the White  House for the first time. I was shown into a waiting-room, and informed  that Mrs. Lincoln was at breakfast. In the waiting-room I found no less  than three mantua-makers waiting for an interview with the wife of the  new President. It seems that Mrs. Lincoln had told several of her lady  friends that she had urgent need for a dress-maker, and that each of  these friends had sent her mantua-maker to the White House. Hope fell at  once. With so many rivals for the position sought after, I regarded my  chances for success as extremely doubtful. I was the last one summoned  to Mrs. Lincoln's presence. All the others had a hearing, and were  dismissed. I went up-stairs timidly, and entering the room with nervous  step, discovered the wife of the President standing by a window, looking  out, and engaged in lively conversation with a lady, Mrs. Grimsly, as I  afterwards learned. Mrs. L. came forward, and greeted me warmly.    \"You have come at last. Mrs. Keckley, who have you worked for in the  city?\"    \"Among others, Mrs. Senator Davis has been one of my best patrons,\" was  my reply.    \"Mrs. Davis! So you have worked for her, have you? Of course you gave  satisfaction; so far, good. Can you do my work?\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Lincoln. Will you have much work for me to do?\"    \"That, Mrs. Keckley, will depend altogether upon your prices. I trust  that your terms are reasonable. I cannot afford to be extravagant. We  are just from the West, and are poor. If you do not charge too much, I  shall be able to give you all my work.\"    \"I do not think there will be any difficulty about charges, Mrs.  Lincoln; my terms are reasonable.\"    \"Well, if you will work cheap, you shall have plenty to do. I can't  afford to pay big prices, so I frankly tell you so in the beginning.\"    The terms were satisfactorily arranged, and I measured Mrs. Lincoln,  took the dress with me, a bright rose-colored moire-antique, and  returned the next day to fit it on her. A number of ladies were in the  room, all making preparations for the levee to come off on Friday night.  These ladies, I learned, were relatives of Mrs. L.'s,--Mrs. Edwards and  Mrs. Kellogg, her own sisters, and Elizabeth Edwards and Julia Baker,  her nieces. Mrs. Lincoln this morning was dressed in a cashmere wrapper,  quilted down the front; and she wore a simple head-dress. The other  ladies wore morning robes.    I was hard at work on the dress, when I was informed that the levee had  been postponed from Friday night till Tuesday night. This, of course,  gave me more time to complete my task. Mrs. Lincoln sent for me, and  suggested some alteration in style, which was made. She also requested  that I make a waist of blue watered silk for Mrs. Grimsly, as work on  the dress would not require all my time.    Tuesday evening came, and I had taken the last stitches on the dress. I  folded it and carried it to the White House, with the waist for Mrs.  Grimsly. When I went up-stairs, I found the ladies in a terrible state  of excitement. Mrs. Lincoln was protesting that she could not go down,  for the reason that she had nothing to wear.    \"Mrs. Keckley, you have disappointed me--deceived me. Why do you bring  my dress at this late hour?\"    \"Because I have just finished it, and I thought I should be in time.\"    \"But you are not in time, Mrs. Keckley; you have bitterly disappointed  me. I have no time now to dress, and, what is more, I will not dress,  and go down-stairs.\"    \"I am sorry if I have disappointed you, Mrs. Lincoln, for I intended to  be in time. Will you let me dress you? I can have you ready in a few  minutes.\"    \"No, I won't be dressed. I will stay in my room. Mr. Lincoln can go down  with the other ladies.\"    \"But there is plenty of time for you to dress, Mary,\" joined in Mrs.  Grimsly and Mrs. Edwards. \"Let Mrs. Keckley assist you, and she will  soon have you ready.\"    Thus urged, she consented. I dressed her hair, and arranged the dress on  her. It fitted nicely, and she was pleased. Mr. Lincoln came in, threw  himself on the sofa, laughed with Willie and little Tad, and then  commenced pulling on his gloves, quoting poetry all the while.    \"You seem to be in a poetical mood to-night,\" said his wife.    \"Yes, mother, these are poetical times,\" was his pleasant reply. \"I  declare, you look charming in that dress. Mrs. Keckley has met with  great success.\" And then he proceeded to compliment the other ladies.    Mrs. Lincoln looked elegant in her rose-colored moire-antique. She wore  a pearl necklace, pearl ear-rings, pearl bracelets, and red roses in her  hair. Mrs. Baker was dressed in lemon-colored silk; Mrs. Kellogg in a  drab silk, ashes of rose; Mrs. Edwards in a brown and black silk; Miss  Edwards in crimson, and Mrs. Grimsly in blue watered silk. Just before  starting downstairs, Mrs. Lincoln's lace handkerchief was the object of  search. It had been displaced by Tad, who was mischievous, and hard to  restrain. The handkerchief found, all became serene. Mrs. Lincoln took  the President's arm, and with smiling face led the train below. I was  surprised at her grace and composure. I had heard so much, in current  and malicious report, of her low life, of her ignorance and vulgarity,  that I expected to see her embarrassed on this occasion. Report, I soon  saw, was wrong. No queen, accustomed to the usages of royalty all her  life, could have comported herself with more calmness and dignity than  did the wife of the President. She was confident and self-possessed, and  confidence always gives grace.    This levee was a brilliant one, and the only one of the season. I became  the regular modiste of Mrs. Lincoln. I made fifteen or sixteen dresses  for her during the spring and early part of the summer, when she left  Washington; spending the hot weather at Saratoga, Long Branch, and other  places. In the mean time I was employed by Mrs. Senator Douglas, one of  the loveliest ladies that I ever met, Mrs. Secretary Wells, Mrs.  Secretary Stanton, and others. Mrs. Douglas always dressed in deep  mourning, with excellent taste, and several of the leading ladies of  Washington society were extremely jealous of her superior attractions.          CHAPTER VI    WILLIE LINCOLN'S DEATH-BED      Mrs. Lincoln returned to Washington in November, and again duty called  me to the White House. The war was now in progress, and every day  brought stirring news from the front--the front, where the Gray opposed  the Blue, where flashed the bright sabre in the sunshine, where were  heard the angry notes of battle, the deep roar of cannon, and the  fearful rattle of musketry; where new graves were being made every day,  where brother forgot a mother's early blessing and sought the lifeblood  of brother, and friend raised the deadly knife against friend. Oh, the  front, with its stirring battle-scenes! Oh, the front, with its ghastly  heaps of dead! The life of the nation was at stake; and when the land  was full of sorrow, there could not be much gayety at the capital. The  days passed quietly with me. I soon learned that some people had an  intense desire to penetrate the inner circle of the White House. No  President and his family, heretofore occupying this mansion, ever  excited so much curiosity as the present incumbents. Mr. Lincoln had  grown up in the wilds of the West, and evil report had said much of him  and his wife. The polite world was shocked, and the tendency to  exaggerate intensified curiosity. As soon as it was known that I was the  modiste of Mrs. Lincoln, parties crowded around and affected friendship  for me, hoping to induce me to betray the secrets of the domestic  circle. One day a woman, I will not call her a lady, drove up to my  rooms, gave me an order to make a dress, and insisted on partly paying  me in advance. She called on me every day, and was exceedingly kind.  When she came to take her dress away, she cautiously remarked:    \"Mrs. Keckley, you know Mrs. Lincoln?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You are her modiste; are you not?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You know her very well; do you not?\"    \"I am with her every day or two.\"    \"Don't you think you would have some influence with her?\"    \"I cannot say. Mrs. Lincoln, I presume, would listen to anything I  should suggest, but whether she would be influenced by a suggestion of  mine is another question.\"    \"I am sure that you could influence her, Mrs. Keckley. Now listen; I  have a proposition to make. I have a great desire to become an inmate of  the White House. I have heard so much of Mr. Lincoln's goodness that I  should like to be near him; and if I can enter the White House no other  way, I am willing to go as a menial. My dear Mrs. Keckley, will you not  recommend me to Mrs. Lincoln as a friend of yours out of employment, and  ask her to take me as a chambermaid? If you will do this you shall be  well rewarded. It may be worth several thousand dollars to you in time.\"    I looked at the woman in amazement. A bribe, and to betray the  confidence of my employer! Turning to her with a glance of scorn, I  said:    \"Madam, you are mistaken in regard to my character. Sooner than betray  the trust of a friend, I would throw"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24989"],[0,"A Short Method Of Prayer (#8)"],[1,"towards God; and thus the more perfect is this  action, the more complete will be the conversion.    Until I am perfectly converted, I need several actions to turn me  towards God. Some are done all at once, others gradually; but my action  ought to lead me to turn to God, employing all the strength of my soul  for Him, as it is written, \"Therefore even now, saith the Lord, turn ye  even to me with all your heart\" (Joel ii. 12). \"Thou shalt return unto  the Lord thy God ... with all thine heart and with all thy soul\" (Deut.  xxx. 2). God only asks for our heart: \"My son, give me thy heart, and  let thine eyes observe my ways\" (Prov. xxiii. 26). To give the heart to  God is to have its gaze, its strength, and its vigour all centred in  Him, to follow His will. We must, then, after we have applied to God,  remain always turned towards Him.    But as the mind of man is weak, and the soul, being accustomed to turn  towards earthly things, is easily turned away from God, it must, as soon  as it perceives that it is turned towards outward things, resume its  former position in God by a simple act of return to Him.    And as several repeated acts form a habit, the soul contracts a habit of  conversion, and from action it passes to a habitual condition.    The soul, then, must not seek by means of any efforts or works of its  own to come near to God; this is seeking to perform one action by means  of others, instead of by a simple action remaining attached to God  alone.    If we believe that we must commit no actions, we are mistaken, for _we  are always acting_; but each one must act according to his degree.    I will endeavour to make this point clear, as, for want of understanding  it, it presents a difficulty to many Christians.    There are _passing_ and _distinct_ actions, and _continued_ actions;  _direct_ acts and _reflected_ acts. All cannot perform the first, and  all are not in a condition to perform the others. The first actions  should be committed by those who are turned away from God. They ought to  turn to Him by a distinct action, more or less strong according to their  distance from Him.    By a _continued_ action I understand that by which the soul is  completely turned towards its God by a _direct_ action, which it does  not renew, unless it has been interrupted, but which exists. The soul  being altogether turned in this way, is in love, and remains there: \"And  he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God\" (1 John iv. 16). Then the  soul may be said to be in a habitual act, resting even in this action.  But its rest is not idle, for it has an action _always in force_, viz.,  _a gentle sinking in God_, in which God attracts it more and more  strongly; and, following this attraction, and resting in love, it sinks  more and more in this love, and has an action infinitely stronger, more  vigorous, and more prompt, than that action which forms only the return.  Now the soul which is in this _profound and strong action_, being turned  towards its God, does not perceive this action, because it is direct,  and not reflex; so that persons in this condition, not knowing how  rightly to describe it, say that _they have no action_. But they are  mistaken; they were never more active. It would be better to say they do  not distinguish any action, than that they do not commit any.    The soul does not act of itself, I admit; but it is drawn, and it  follows the attracting power. Love is the weight which sinks it, as a  person who falls in the sea sinks, and would sink to infinity if the sea  were infinite; and without perceiving its sinking, it would sink to the  most profound depths with an incredible speed. It is, then, incorrect to  say that no actions are committed. All commit actions, but all do not  commit them in the same manner; and the abuse arises from the fact, that  those who know that action is inevitable wish it to be _distinct_ and  _sensible_. But sensible action is for beginners, and the other for  those more advanced. To stop with the first would be to deprive  ourselves of the last; and to wish to commit the last before having  passed the first would be an equal abuse.    Everything must be done in its season; each state has its commencement,  its progress, and its end. There is no act which has not its beginning.  At first we must work with _effort_, but afterwards we enjoy the fruit  of our labour.    When a vessel is in the harbour, the sailors have a difficulty in  bringing it into the open sea; but once there, they easily turn it in  the direction in which they wish to navigate. So, when the soul is in  sin, it needs an effort to drag it out; the cords which bind it must be  loosened; then, by means of strong and vigorous action, it must be drawn  within itself, little by little leaving the harbour, and being turned  within, which is the place to which its voyage should be directed.    When the vessel is thus turned, in proportion as it advances in the sea,  it leaves the land behind it, and the further it goes from the land, the  less effort is needed to carry it along. At last it begins to sail  gently, and the vessel goes on so rapidly that the oars become useless.  What does the pilot do then? He is contented with spreading the sails  and sitting at the helm.    _Spreading the sails_ is simply laying ourselves before God, to be  moved by His Spirit. _Sitting at the helm_ is preventing our heart from  leaving the right way, rowing it gently, and leading it according to the  movement of the Spirit of God, who gradually takes possession of it, as  the wind gradually fills the sails, and impels the vessel forward. So  long as the vessel sails before the wind, the mariners rest from their  labour. They voyage farther in an hour, while they rest in this manner  and leave the ship to be carried along by the wind, than they would in a  much longer time by their own efforts; and if they wished to row,  besides the fatigue which would result from it, their labour would be  useless, and would only serve to retard the vessel.    This is the conduct we should pursue in our inner life, and in acting  thus we shall advance more in a short time by the Divine guidance, than  we ever could do by our own efforts. If only you will try this way, you  will find it the easiest possible.    When the wind is contrary, if the wind and the tempest are violent, the  anchor must be thrown in the sea to stop the vessel. This _anchor_ is  trust in God and hope in His goodness, waiting in patience for the  tempest to cease, and for a favourable wind to return, as David did:  \"I waited patiently for the Lord,\" he says, \"and He inclined unto me\"  (Ps. xl. 1).          CHAPTER XVIII.    THE DRYNESS OF PREACHERS, AND THE VARIOUS EVILS WHICH ARISE FROM THEIR  FAILING TO TEACH HEART-PRAYER--EXHORTATION TO PASTORS TO LEAD PEOPLE  TOWARDS THIS FORM OF PRAYER, WITHOUT AMUSING THEM WITH STUDIED AND  METHODICAL DEVOTION.      If all those who are working for the conquest of souls sought to win  them _by the heart_, leading them first of all to prayer and to the  inner life, they would see many and lasting conversions. But so long as  they only address themselves to the outside, and instead of drawing  people to Christ by occupying their hearts with Him, they only give them  a thousand precepts for outward observances, they will see but little  fruit, and that will not be lasting.    When once the heart is won, other defects are easily corrected. This is  why God particularly asks for the _heart_. By this means alone would be  prevented the drunkenness, blasphemy, lewdness, enmity, and robbery  which are prevalent in the world. Jesus Christ would reign universally,  and the Church everywhere would be revived.    Error only takes possession of the soul in the absence of faith and  prayer. If men could be taught to _believe simply_ and to _pray_,  instead of disputing amongst themselves, they would be gently led to  Christ.    Oh, how inestimable is the loss of those who neglect the inner life! Oh,  what an account will they have to render to God who have the charge of  souls, for not having discovered this hidden treasure to all those whom  they serve in the ministry of the Word!    The excuse given is that there is _danger_ in this way, or that ignorant  people are incapable of spiritual things. The oracle of truth assures us  that God has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and has  revealed them to babes. And what danger can there be in walking in the  only true way, which is Jesus Christ, in giving ourselves to Him,  looking to Him continually, putting all our trust in His grace, and  tending, with all the forces of our souls, to His pure love?    Far from the simple ones being _incapable_ of this perfection, they are  the most suitable for it, because they are more docile, more humble, and  more innocent; and as they do not reason, they are not so attached to  their own light. Having no science, they more readily suffer themselves  to be guided by the Spirit of God: while others who are blind in their  own sufficiency resist the divine inspiration.    God tells us, too, that it is to the _simple_ He gives understanding by  the entrance of His Word (Ps. cxix. 130). \"The testimony of the Lord is  sure, making wise the _simple_\" (Ps. xix. 7). \"The Lord preserveth the  _simple_: I was brought low, and He helped me\" (Ps. cxvi. 6).    O ye who have the oversight of souls! see that you do not prevent the  little ones from going to Christ. His words to His disciples were,  \"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of  such is the kingdom of God\" (Luke xviii. 16). Jesus only said this to  His disciples, because they wished to keep the children away from Him.  Often the remedy is applied to the body, when the disease is at the  _heart_. The reason why we have so little success in seeking to reform  men, is that we direct our efforts to the outside, and all that we can  do there soon passes off."]]]
