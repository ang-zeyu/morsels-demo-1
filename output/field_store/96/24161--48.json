There was no beginning and no end to the fear and no way to  escape.    When consciousness returned Jason could remember no detail of the  nightmare. Just the fear remained. He was soaked with sweat and ached in  every muscle. It must have been the massive dose of shots, he finally  decided, that and the brutal gravity. That didn't take the taste of fear  out of his mouth, though.    Brucco stuck his head in the door then and looked Jason up and down.  \"Thought you were dead,\" he said. \"Slept the clock around. Don't move,  I'll get something to pick you up.\"    The pickup was in the form of another needle and a glassful of  evil-looking fluid. It settled his thirst, but made him painfully aware  of gnawing hunger.    \"Want to eat?\" Brucco asked. \"I'll bet you do. I've speeded up your  metabolism so you'll build muscle faster. Only way you'll ever beat the  gravity. Give you quite an appetite for a while though.\"    Brucco ate at the same time and Jason had a chance to ask some  questions. \"When do I get a chance to look around your fascinating  planet? So far this trip has been about as interesting as a jail term.\"    \"Relax and enjoy your food. Probably be months before you're able to go  outside. If at all.\"    Jason felt his jaw hanging and closed it with a snap. \"Could you  possibly tell me why?\"    \"Of course. You will have to go through the same training course that  our children take. It takes them six years. Of course it's their first  six years of life. So you might think that you, as an adult, could learn  faster. Then again they have the advantage of heredity. All I can say is  you'll go outside these sealed buildings when you're ready.\"    Brucco had finished eating while he talked, and sat staring at Jason's  bare arms with growing disgust. \"The first thing we want to get you is a  gun,\" he said. \"It gives me a sick feeling to see someone without one.\"    Of course Brucco wore his own gun continually, even within the sealed  buildings.    \"Every gun is fitted to its owner and would be useless on anyone else,\"  Brucco said. \"I'll show you why.\" He led Jason to an armory jammed with  deadly weapons. \"Put your arm in this while I make the adjustments.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was a boxlike machine with a pistol grip on the side. Jason clutched  the grip and rested his elbow on a metal loop. Brucco fixed pointers  that touched his arm, then copied the results from the meters. Reading  the figures from his list he selected various components from bins and  quickly assembled a power holster and gun. With the holster strapped to  his forearm and the gun in his hand, Jason noticed for the first time  they were connected by a flexible cable. The gun fitted his hand  perfectly.    \"This is the secret of the power holster,\" Brucco said, tapping the  flexible cable. \"It is perfectly loose while you are using the weapon.  But when you want it returned to the holster--\" Brucco made an  adjustment and the cable became a stiff rod that whipped the gun from  Jason's hand and suspended it in midair.    \"Then the return.\" The rod-cable whirred and snapped the gun back into  the holster. \"The drawing action is the opposite of this, of course.\"    \"A great gadget,\" Jason said, \"but how _do_ I draw? Do I whistle or  something for the gun to pop out?\"    \"No, it is not sonic control,\" Brucco answered with a sober face. \"It is  much more precise than that. Here, take your left hand and grasp an  imaginary gun butt. Tense your trigger finger. Do you notice the pattern  of the tendons in the wrist? Sensitive actuators touch the tendons in  your right wrist. They ignore all patterns except the one that says  _hand ready to receive gun_. After a time the mechanism becomes  completely automatic. When you want the gun--it is in your hand. When  you don't--it is in the holster.\"    Jason made grasping motions with his right hand, crooked his index  finger. There was a sudden, smashing pain against his hand and a loud  roar. The gun was in his hand--half the fingers were numb--and smoke  curled up from the barrel.    \"Of course there are only blank charges in the gun until you learn  control. Guns are _always_ loaded. There is no safety. Notice the lack  of a trigger guard. That enables you to bend your trigger finger a  slight bit more when drawing so the gun will fire the instant it touches  your hand.\"    It was without a doubt the most murderous weapon Jason had ever  handled, as well as being the hardest to manage. Working against the  muscle-burning ache of high gravity, he fought to control the devilish  device. It had an infuriating way of vanishing into the holster just as  he was about to pull the trigger. Even worse was the tendency to leap  out before he was quite ready. The gun went to the position where his  hand should be. If the fingers weren't correctly placed, they were  crashed aside. Jason only stopped the practice when his entire hand was  one livid bruise.    Complete mastery would come with time, but he could already understand  why the Pyrrans never removed their guns. It would be like removing a  part of your own body. The movement of gun from holster to hand was too  fast for him to detect. It was certainly faster than the neural current  that shaped the hand into the gun-holding position. For all apparent  purposes it was like having a lightning bolt in your fingertip. Point  the finger and _blamm_, there's the explosion.           *       *       *       *       *    Brucco had left Jason to practice alone. When his aching hand could take  no more, he stopped and headed back towards his own quarters. Turning a  corner he had a quick glimpse of a familiar figure going away from him.    \"Meta! Wait for a second--I want to talk to you.\"    She turned impatiently as he shuffled up, going as fast as he could in  the doubled gravity. Everything about her seemed different from the girl  he had known on the ship. Heavy boots came as high as her knees, her  figure was lost in bulky coveralls of some metallic fabric. The trim  waist was bulged out by a belt of canisters. Her very expression was  coldly distant.    \"I've missed you,\" he said. \"I hadn't realized you were in this  building.\" He reached for her hand but she moved it out of his reach.    \"What is it you want?\" she asked.    \"What is it I want!\" he echoed with barely concealed anger. \"This is  Jason, remember me? We're friends. It _is_ allowed for friends to talk  without 'wanting' anything.\"    \"What happened on the ship has nothing to do with what happens on  Pyrrus.\" She started forward impatiently as she talked. \"I have finished  my reconditioning and must return to work. You'll be staying here in the  sealed buildings so I won't be seeing you.\"    \"Why don't you say 'with the rest of the children'--that's what your  tone implies? And don't try walking out, there are some things we have  to settle first--\"    Jason made the mistake of putting out his hand to stop her. He didn't  really know what happened next. One instant he was standing--the next he  sprawled suddenly on the floor. His shoulder was badly bruised, and Meta  had vanished down the corridor.    Limping back to his own room he cursed women in general and Meta in  particular. Dropping onto his rock-hard bed he tried to remember the  reasons that had brought him here in the first place. And weighed them  against the perpetual torture of the gravity, the fear-filled dreams it  inspired, the automatic contempt of these people for any outsider. He  quickly checked the growing tendency to feel sorry for himself. By  Pyrran standards he _was_ soft and helpless. If he wanted them to think  any better of him, he would have to change a good deal.    He sank into a fatigue-drugged sleep then, that was broken only by the  screaming fear of his dreams.          VII.      In the morning Jason awoke with a bad headache and the feeling he had  never been to sleep. As he took some of the carefully portioned  stimulants that Brucco had given him, he wondered again about the  combination of factors that filled his sleep with such horror.    \"Eat quickly,\" Brucco told him when they met in the dining room. \"I can  no longer spare you time for individual instruction. You will join the  regular classes and take the prescribed courses. Only come to me if  there is some special problem that the instructors or trainers can't  handle.\"    The classes--as Jason should have expected--were composed of stern-faced  little children. With their compact bodies and no-nonsense mannerisms  they were recognizably Pyrran. But they were still children enough to  consider it very funny to have an adult in their classes. Jammed behind  one of the tiny desks, the red-faced Jason did not think it was much of  a joke.    All resemblance to a normal school ended with the physical form of the  classroom. For one thing, every child--no matter how small--packed a  gun. And the courses were all involved with survival. The only possible  grade in a curriculum like this was one hundred per cent and students  stayed with a lesson until they mastered it perfectly. No courses were  offered in the normal scholastic subjects. Presumably these were studied  after the child graduated survival school and could face the world  alone. Which was a logical and cold-hearted way of looking at things. In  fact, logical and cold-hearted could describe any Pyrran activity.    Most of the morning was spent on the operation of one of the medikits  that strapped around the waist. This was a poison analyzer that was  pressed over a puncture wound. If any toxins were present, the antidote  was automatically injected on the site. Simple in operation but  incredibly complex in construction. Since all Pyrrans serviced their own  equipment--you could then only blame yourself if it failed--they had to  learn the construction"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#8)"],[1,"towards the _ovaries_, the reproductive glands of the female, homologous  with the testicles in the male, and situated on either side of the upper  extremity of the uterus. The shape of the ovaries is somewhat ovoid.  They contain a large number of vesicular structures, the _ovarian  follicles_, the largest, ripe follicles being known as _Graafian  follicles_, whilst the smaller, partially developed follicles are termed  _primitive ovarian follicles_, or _primitive Graafian follicles_. In the  interior of each follicle is an _ovum_. In the sexually mature woman, a  Graafian follicle ripens at regular intervals of four weeks. When ripe,  the follicle bursts, the ovum is expelled, and passes through the  Fallopian tube into the interior of the uterus: here it is either  fertilised by uniting with a spermatozoon derived from the male, in  which case it proceeds to develop into an embryo; or else it remains  unfertilised, in which case it is shortly expelled from the body.    In the uterus, as well as in the ovaries, an important change occurs at  intervals of four weeks, characterised by an increased flow of blood to  the organ, culminating in an actual outflow of blood from the vessels  into the uterine cavity, and thence through the vagina to the exterior  of the body; the whole process is known as _menstruation_, the _monthly  sickness_ or the (_monthly_) _period_. After the fertilisation of the  ovum, during pregnancy, that is to say, menstruation usually ceases  until after the birth of the child, and often until the completion of  lactation.    I do not propose to discuss here the nature of the connexion between  these periodic processes in the ovaries and the uterus,  respectively--that is, between ovulation and menstruation. I shall,  however, take this opportunity of stating that, as careful  investigations have shown, the periodic processes in question are not  limited to the uterus and the ovaries, but affect also the external  genital organs, which become congested simultaneously with menstruation;  and further, that the entire feminine organism is affected by an  undulatory rhythm of nutrition, the rise and fall of which correspond to  menstruation and to the intermenstrual interval, respectively.    I must now give some account of the peripheral processes occurring in  the female genital organs in connexion with the sexual act. In part,  they are completely analogous to those which take place in the male. I  have already pointed out that in many respects the clitoris in the  female corresponds to the penis in the male, In the clitoris, also,  erection occurs, conditioned partly by psychical and partly by physical  stimuli. The psychical stimuli consist of ideas relating to the male.  The physical stimuli may, just as in the case of the other sex, vary in  their nature. Thus, the condition of the reproductive glands may act as  a physical stimulus to erection; also the touching of certain regions of  the body, especially the clitoris, the labia minora, or other erogenic  zones. Under the influence of such stimuli, the venus plexuses making up  the vaginal bulbs also become distended with blood. In fact, speaking  generally, sexual excitement is characterised by a vigorous flow of  blood to the genital organs. During coitus, in woman, as in man, a  process of ejaculation normally occurs, taking the form of rhythmical  muscular contractions, affecting not only the perineal muscles, but also  the muscular investment of the vagina, and occasionally, perhaps, the  uterus itself. These muscular contractions also favour the expulsion of  a secretion, but this secretion does not contain the reproductive cells  of the female, and consists merely of a mixture of indifferent  secretions--the secretion of Bartholin's glands, that of the uterine  mucous membrane, and that of the mucous glands of the vagina and vulva.  In the woman also, even at the outset of the sexual act, a secretion  from the local glands takes place, whereby the genital region is  moistened prior to the actual orgasm. We have as yet no precise  knowledge as to which glands are concerned in the production of this  phenomenon, which is homologous to the _urethrorrhaea ex libidine_ of the  male. In woman, as in man, the curve of voluptuousness exhibits four  phases: an ascending limb, the equable voluptuous sensation, the acme,  and the rapid decline. There are, however, in this respect, certain  differences between man and woman, to which von Krafft-Ebing drew  attention, and whose existence was confirmed by Otto Alder.[9] Whereas  in the male the curve of voluptuousness both rises and falls with  extreme abruptness, in the female both the onset and the decline of  voluptuous sensation are slower and more gradual. There is an additional  difference between man and woman. In woman very often voluptuous  pleasure is entirely lacking; certainly such absence is far commoner in  women than in men--a condition of affairs which must on no account be  confused with _absence of the sexual impulse_. Even when the sexual  impulse is perfectly normal, the entire voluptuous curve with its acme  may be wanting. In such cases, the after-sense of complete satisfaction,  which occurs more especially when ejaculation has been associated with  an extremity of voluptuous pleasure, it is commonly also lacking.  Finally, it is necessary to add that in woman, as in man, the  reproductive glands appear to have a duplex function--such is, at least,  the belief to which recent investigations more and more definitely  point. The ovaries, that is to say, do not only produce ova; they also,  like the testicles, furnish an internal secretion, and the absorption  and distribution of this secretion by the blood are supposed to cause  the development of the secondary sexual characters in woman.    Having now concluded our account of the structure and functions of the  productive organs of adults, let us turn to consider the differences  between these organs and those of children. In the child, the testicles  are considerably smaller; smaller also are the penis and the other  genital organs. In the adult, the root of the penis is surrounded by the  pubic hair; this hair is absent in the child. The most important  distinctive characteristic, however, lies in the fact that in the child  the morphological elements upon which the capacity for procreation  depends, namely, the spermatozoa, are not yet present in the testicles.  The spermatozoa first make their appearance during that year of life  which is usually regarded as the year of the puberal development. The  microscopical appearances of the testicle, of which an account has  previously been given, thus naturally differ according as the specimen  under examination has been taken from a child or from an adult. As  regards the other glands considered to form part of the genital organs,  some of these secrete even in childhood. This matter will be  subsequently discussed in some detail.    In the female sex, also, there are notable differences in the condition  of the genital organs between the adult and the child. In the first  place, the relative sizes of the various organs differ greatly. But  other differences are also noticeable, not dependent, however, on  differences in age, but on whether there has or has not been experience  of sexual intercourse, and on whether pregnancy and parturition have  occurred. When we compare a female child with an adult woman, the first  obvious difference is in the shape of the external genital organs. In  the child, the vulva is placed much higher and more to the front, so  that it is distinctly visible even when the thighs are in close  apposition. In the child, also, the labia majora are less developed, for  as womanhood approaches a great deposit of fat takes place in these  structures. Again, in the child, the outer surfaces of the labia majora  and that part of the skin of the abdomen just in front of the labia (the  _mons veneris_) are as hairless as the rest of the body, whereas in the  adult woman these regions are covered with the pubic hair. According to  Marthe Francillon,[10] to whom we are indebted for an elaborate study of  puberty in the female sex, during the puberal development changes occur  also in the clitoris. The genital corpuscles of Krause and the  corpuscles of Finger (_Wollustkoerperchen_), the terminals of the nerves  passing to the erectile tissue of the clitoris, undergo at this time a  marked increase in size. The clitoris itself, hitherto comparatively  small, now attains a length of three to four centimetres (1.2 to 1.6  inch), in the quiescent state, and of four and a half to five  centimetres (1.8 to 2 inches) when erect. In the virgin also, as  previously mentioned, the hymen is present, a structure of very variable  form. After defloration its remnants persist in the form of small  prominences around the margin of the vaginal inlet (_carunculae  myrtiformes_). But, quite independently of defloration, in the child the  vaginal orifice is much smaller than in the riper girl. The uterus  undergoes remarkable changes. In the foetus, during the latter part of  intra-uterine life, this organ grows very rapidly; but immediately after  birth its growth is arrested, so that in a girl of nine it is little  larger than in the new-born infant. During the period of puberal  development, however, the growth of the organ is once more extremely  rapid. Its shape also changes at this time. In the child, the uterus is  longer in proportion to its thickness; in childhood, too, the  comparative length of the cervix in relation to that of the body of the  organ is much greater than in the adult woman. We need only allude in  passing to the fact that later in life marked changes occur in the  uterus as a result of pregnancy and parturition. The hyperaemia and the  bleeding that take place periodically during menstruation lead to  certain changes in the mucous surface"]]]
