An  estimated 12 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's  duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Agricultural  production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to  be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.  Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. The  rapid pace of European economic integration is a potential threat to  Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.      _#_GDP: $727 million, per capita $14,000; real growth rate NA%  (1990 est.)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%      _#_Unemployment rate: none      _#_Budget: revenues $NA;

Oil  production is the most lucrative sector of the economy, contributing  about 50% to GDP. In recent years, however, the impact of fighting an  internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be  imported.  For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural  resources, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land.  To realize its  economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace but also  must reform government policies that have led to distortions and  imbalances throughout the economy.      _#_GDP: $7.9 billion, per capita $925; real growth rate 2.0% (1990  est.)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 23.2% (1988)      _#_Unemployment rate: NA%      _#_Budget: revenues $2.6 billion; expenditures $4.4 billion,  including capital expenditures of $963 million (1990 est.)      _#_Exports: $3.8 billion (f.o.b., 1990 est.);    commodities--oil,liquified petroleum gas, diamonds, coffee, sisal,  fish and fish products, timber, cotton;    partners--US, USSR, Cuba, Portugal, Brazil, France      _#_Imports: $1.5 billion (f.o.b., 1990 est.);    commodities--capital equipment (machinery and electrical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25012"],[0,"The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and Selected Aphorisms. (#8)"],[1,"with the  third act, he _approves_ his work according to the quality of its final  effect. Guided by this sort of understanding of the stage, there is not  much danger of one's creating a drama unawares. Drama demands _inexorable_  logic: but what did Wagner care about logic? Again I say, it was not  Corneille's public that he had to consider; but merely Germans! Everybody  knows the technical difficulties before which the dramatist often has to  summon all his strength and frequently to sweat his blood: the difficulty  of making the _plot_ seem necessary and the unravelment as well, so that  both are conceivable only in a certain way, and so that each may give the  impression of freedom (the principle of the smallest expenditure of  energy). Now the very last thing that Wagner does is to sweat blood over  the plot; and on this and the unravelment he certainly spends the smallest  possible amount of energy. Let anybody put one of Wagner's \"plots\" under  the microscope, and I wager that he will be forced to laugh. Nothing is  more enlivening than the dilemma in \"Tristan,\" unless it be that in the  \"Mastersingers.\" Wagner is _no_ dramatist; let nobody be deceived on this  point. All he did was to love the word \"drama\"--he always loved fine words.  Nevertheless, in his writings the word \"drama\" is merely a  misunderstanding (--_and_ a piece of shrewdness: Wagner always affected  superiority in regard to the word \"opera\"--), just as the word \"spirit\" is  a misunderstanding in the New Testament.--He was not enough of a  psychologist for drama; he instinctively avoided a psychological plot--but  how?--by always putting idiosyncrasy in its place.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Very modern--eh? Very  Parisian! very decadent!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Incidentally, the _plots_ that Wagner knows how  to unravel with the help of dramatic inventions, are of quite another  kind. For example, let us suppose that Wagner requires a female voice. A  whole act without a woman's voice would be impossible! But in this  particular instance not one of the heroines happens to be free. What does  Wagner do? He emancipates the oldest woman on earth, Erda. \"Step up, aged  grandmamma! You have got to sing!\" And Erda sings. Wagner's end has been  achieved. Thereupon he immediately dismisses the old lady. \"Why on earth  did you come? Off with you! Kindly go to sleep again!\" In short, a scene  full of mythological awe, before which the Wagnerite _wonders_ all kinds  of things.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    --\"But the substance of Wagner's texts! their mythical substance, their  eternal substance\"--Question: how is this substance, this eternal substance  tested? The chemical analyst replies: Translate Wagner into the real, into  the modern,--let us be even more cruel, and say into the bourgeois! And  what will then become of him?--Between ourselves, I have tried the  experiment. Nothing is more entertaining, nothing more worthy of being  recommended to a picnic-party, than to discuss Wagner dressed in a more  modern garb: for instance Parsifal, as a candidate in divinity, with a  public-school education (--the latter, quite indispensable _for pure_  foolishness). What _surprises_ await one! Would you believe it, that  Wagner's heroines one and all, once they have been divested of the heroic  husks, are almost indistinguishable from Mdme. Bovary!--just as one can  conceive conversely, of Flaubert's being _well able_ to transform all his  heroines into Scandinavian or Carthaginian women, and then to offer them  to Wagner in this mythologised form as a libretto. Indeed, generally  speaking, Wagner does not seem to have become interested in any other  problems than those which engross the little Parisian decadents of to-day.  Always five paces away from the hospital! All very modern problems, all  problems which are at home _in big cities!_ do not doubt it!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Have you  noticed (it is in keeping with this association of ideas) that Wagner's  heroines never have any children?--They _cannot_ have them.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The despair  with which Wagner tackled the problem of arranging in some way for  Siegfried's birth, betrays how modern his feelings on this point actually  were.--Siegfried \"emancipated woman\"--but not with any hope of  offspring.--And now here is a fact which leaves us speechless: Parsifal is  Lohengrin's father! How ever did he do it?--Ought one at this juncture to  remember that \"chastity works miracles\"?{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    _Wagnerus dixit princeps in castitate auctoritas._          10.      And now just a word _en passant_ concerning Wagner's writings: they are  among other things a school of _shrewdness_. The system of procedures of  which Wagner disposes, might be applied to a hundred other cases,--he that  hath ears to hear let him hear. Perhaps I may lay claim to some public  acknowledgment, if I put three of the most valuable of these procedures  into a precise form.    Everything that Wagner _cannot_ do is bad.    Wagner could do much more than he does; but his strong principles prevent  him.    Everything that Wagner _can_ do, no one will ever be able to do after him,  no one has ever done before him, and no one must ever do after him. Wagner  is godly.    These three propositions are the quintessence of Wagner's writings;--the  rest is merely--\"literature\".    --Not every kind of music hitherto has been in need of literature; and it  were well, to try and discover the actual reason of this. Is it perhaps  that Wagner's music is too difficult to understand? Or did he fear  precisely the reverse--that it was too easy,--that people might _not  understand it with sufficient difficulty_?--As a matter of fact, his whole  life long, he did nothing but repeat one proposition: that his music did  not mean music alone! But something more! Something immeasurably more!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}  \"_Not music alone_\"--_no_ musician would speak in this way. I repeat,  Wagner could not create things as a whole; he had no choice, he was  obliged to create things in bits, with \"motives,\" attitudes, formulae,  duplications, and hundreds of repetitions, he remained a rhetorician in  music,--and that is why he was at bottom _forced_ to press \"this means\"  into the foreground. \"Music can never be anything else than a means\": this  was his theory, but above all it was the only _practice_ that lay open to  him. No musician however thinks in this way.--Wagner was in need of  literature, in order to persuade the whole world to take his music  seriously, profoundly, \"because it _meant_ an infinity of things\", all his  life he was the commentator of the \"Idea.\"--What does Elsa stand for? But  without a doubt, Elsa is \"the unconscious _mind of the people_\" (--\"when I  realised this, I naturally became a thorough revolutionist\"--).    Do not let us forget that, when Hegel and Schelling were misleading the  minds of Germany, Wagner was still young: that he guessed, or rather fully  grasped, that the only thing which Germans take seriously is--\"the  idea,\"--that is to say, something obscure, uncertain, wonderful; that among  Germans lucidity is an objection, logic a refutation. Schopenhauer  rigorously pointed out the dishonesty of Hegel's and Schelling's  age,--rigorously, but also unjustly, for he himself, the pessimistic old  counterfeiter, was in no way more \"honest\" than his more famous  contemporaries. But let us leave morality out of the question, Hegel is a  _matter of taste_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And not only of German but of European taste!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} A taste  which Wagner understood!--which he felt equal to! which he has  immortalised!--All he did was to apply it to music--he invented a style for  himself, which might mean an \"infinity of things,\"--he was _Hegel's_ heir.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}  Music as \"Idea.\"--    And how well Wagner was understood!--The same kind of man who used to gush  over Hegel, now gushes over Wagner, in his school they even _write_  Hegelian.(11) But he who understood Wagner best, was the German youthlet.  The two words \"infinity\" and \"meaning\" were sufficient for this: at their  sound the youthlet immediately began to feel exceptionally happy. Wagner  did _not_ conquer these boys with music, but with the \"idea\":--it is the  enigmatical vagueness of his art, its game of hide-and-seek amid a hundred  symbols, its polychromy in ideals, which leads and lures the lads. It is  Wagner's genius for forming clouds, his sweeps and swoops through the air,  his ubiquity and nullibiety--precisely the same qualities with which Hegel  led and lured in his time!--Moreover in the presence of Wagner's  multifariousness, plenitude and arbitrariness, they seem to themselves  justified--\"saved\". Tremulously they listen while the _great symbols_ in  his art seem to make themselves heard from out the misty distance, with a  gentle roll of thunder, and they are not at all displeased if at times it  gets a little grey, gruesome and cold. Are they not one and all, like  Wagner himself, on _quite intimate terms_ with bad weather, with German  weather! Wotan is their God, but Wotan is the God of bad weather.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} They  are right, how could these German youths--in their present condition,--miss  what we others, we _halcyonians_, miss in Wagner? _i.e._: _la gaya  scienza_; light feet, wit, fire, grave, grand logic, stellar dancing,  wanton intellectuality, the vibrating light of the South, the calm  sea--perfection.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}          11.      --I have mentioned the sphere to which Wagner belongs--certainly not to the  history of music. What, however, does he mean historically?--_The rise of  the actor in music_: a momentous event which not only leads me to think  but also to fear.    In a word: \"Wagner and Liszt.\" Never yet have the \"uprightness\" and  \"genuineness\" of musicians been put to such a dangerous test. It is  glaringly obvious: great success, mob success is no longer"]]]
