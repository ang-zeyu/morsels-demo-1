Where do  you go to eat strawberries and cream? To Roslin Chapel, I believe; not  to the portico of the last-built institution. What do you see your  children doing, obeying their own natural and true instincts? What are  your daughters drawing upon their cardboard screens as soon as they can  use a pencil? Not Parthenon fronts, I think, but the ruins of Melrose  Abbey, or Linlithgow Palace, or Lochleven Castle, their own pure Scotch  hearts leading them straight to the right things, in spite of all that  they are told to the contrary. You perhaps call this romantic, and  youthful, and foolish. I am pressed for time now, and I cannot ask you  to consider the meaning of the word \"Romance.\" I will do that, if you  please, in next lecture, for it is a word of greater weight and  authority than we commonly believe. In the meantime, I will endeavor,  lastly, to show you, not the romantic, but the plain and practical  conclusions which should follow from the facts I have laid before you.    25. I have endeavored briefly to point out to you the propriety and  naturalness of the two great Gothic forms, the pointed arch and gable  roof. I wish now to tell you in what way they ought to be introduced  into modern domestic architecture.    You will all admit that there is neither romance nor comfort in waiting  at your own or at any one else's door on a windy and rainy day, till  the servant comes from the end of the house to open it. You all know the  critical nature of that opening--the drift of wind into the passage, the  impossibility of putting down the umbrella at the proper moment without  getting a cupful of water dropped down the back of your neck from the  top of the door-way; and you know how little these inconveniences are  abated by the common Greek portico at the top of the steps. You know how  the east winds blow through those unlucky couples of pillars, which are  all that your architects find consistent with due observance of the  Doric order. Then, away with these absurdities; and the next house you  build, insist upon having the pure old Gothic porch, walled in on both  sides, with its pointed arch entrance and gable roof above. Under that,  you can put down your umbrella at your leisure, and, if you will, stop a  moment to talk with your friend as you give him the parting shake of the  hand. And if now and then a wayfarer found a moment's rest on a stone  seat on each side of it, I believe you would find the insides of your  houses not one whit the less comfortable; and, if you answer me, that  were such refuges built in the open streets, they would become mere  nests of filthy vagrants, I reply that I do not despair of such a change  in the administration of the poor laws of this country, as shall no  longer leave any of our fellow creatures in a state in which they would  pollute the steps of our houses by resting upon them for a night. But if  not, the command to all of us is strict and straight, \"When thou seest  the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou bring the poor that are  cast out to _thy house_.\"[13] Not to the work-house, observe, but to  _thy_ house: and I say it would be better a thousandfold, that our doors  should be beset by the poor day by day, than that it should be written  of any one of us, \"They reap every one his corn in the field, and they  gather the vintage of the wicked. They cause the naked to lodge without  shelter, that they have no covering in the cold. They are wet with the  showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock, for want of a  shelter.\"[14]    [Footnote 13: Isa. lviii. 7.]    [Footnote 14: Job xxiv. 6-8.]    26. This, then, is the first use to which your pointed arches and gable  roofs are to be put. The second is of more personal pleasurableness. You  surely must all of you feel and admit the delightfulness of a bow  window; I can hardly fancy a room can be perfect without one. Now you  have nothing to do but to resolve that every one of your principal rooms  shall have a bow window, either large or small. Sustain the projection  of it on a bracket, crown it above with a little peaked roof, and give a  massy piece of stone sculpture to the pointed arch in each of its  casements, and you will have as inexhaustible a source of quaint  richness in your street architecture, as of additional comfort and  delight in the interiors of your rooms.    27. Thirdly, as respects windows which do not project. You will find  that the proposal to build them with pointed arches is met by an  objection on the part of your architects, that you cannot fit them with  comfortable sashes. I beg leave to tell you that such an objection is  utterly futile and ridiculous. I have lived for months in Gothic  palaces, with pointed windows of the most complicated forms, fitted with  modern sashes; and with the most perfect comfort. But granting that the  objection were a true one--and I suppose it is true to just this extent,  that it may cost some few shillings more per window in the first  instance to set the fittings to a pointed arch than to a square  one--there is not the smallest necessity for the _aperture_ of the  window being of the pointed shape. Make the uppermost or bearing arch  pointed only, and make the top of the window square, filling the  interval with a stone shield, and you may have a perfect school of  architecture, not only consistent with, but eminently conducive to,  every comfort of your daily life. The window in Oakham Castle (_fig._ 2)  is an example of such a form as actually employed in the thirteenth  century; and I shall have to notice another in the course of next  lecture.    28. Meanwhile, I have but one word to say, in conclusion. Whatever has  been advanced in the course of this evening, has rested on the  assumption that all architecture was to be of brick and stone; and may  meet with some hesitation in its acceptance, on account of the probable  use of iron, glass, and such other materials in our future edifices. I  cannot now enter into any statement of the possible uses of iron or  glass, but I will give you one reason, which I think will weigh strongly  with most here, why it is not likely that they will ever become  important elements in architectural effect. I know that I am speaking to  a company of philosophers, but you are not philosophers of the kind who  suppose that the Bible is a superannuated book; neither are you of those  who think the Bible is dishonored by being referred to for judgment in  small matters. The very divinity of the Book seems to me, on the  contrary, to justify us in referring _every_ thing to it, with respect  to which any conclusion can be gathered from its pages. Assuming then  that the Bible is neither superannuated now, nor ever likely to be so,  it will follow that the illustrations which the Bible employs are likely  to be _clear and intelligible illustrations_ to the end of time. I do  not mean that everything spoken of in the Bible histories must continue  to endure for all time, but that the things which the Bible uses for  illustration of eternal truths are likely to remain eternally  intelligible illustrations. Now, I find that iron architecture is indeed  spoken of in the Bible. You know how it is said to Jeremiah, \"Behold, I  have made thee this day a defensed city, and an iron pillar, and brazen  walls, against the whole land.\" But I do not find that iron building is  ever alluded to as likely to become _familiar_ to the minds of men; but,  on the contrary, that an architecture of carved stone is continually  employed as a source of the most important illustrations. A simple  instance must occur to all of you at once. The force of the image of the  Corner Stone, as used throughout Scripture, would completely be lost, if  the Christian and civilized world were ever extensively to employ any  other material than earth and rock in their domestic buildings: I firmly  believe that they never will; but that as the laws of beauty are more  perfectly established, we shall be content still to build as our  forefathers built, and still to receive the same great lessons which  such building is calculated to convey; of which one is indeed never to  be forgotten. Among the questions respecting towers which were laid  before you to-night, one has been omitted: \"What man is there of you  intending to build a tower, that sitteth not down first and counteth the  cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\" I have pressed upon you,  this evening, the building of domestic towers. You may think it right to  dismiss the subject at once from your thoughts; but let us not do so,  without considering, each of us, how far _that_ tower has been built,  and how truly its cost has been counted.          LECTURE II.    ARCHITECTURE.    _Delivered November 4, 1853._      29. Before proceeding to the principal subject of this evening, I wish  to anticipate one or two objections which may arise in your minds to  what I must lay before you. It may perhaps have been felt by you last  evening, that some things I proposed to you were either romantic or  Utopian. Let us think for a few moments what romance and Utopianism  mean.    First, romance. In consequence of the many absurd fictions which long  formed the elements of romance writing, the word romance is sometimes  taken as synonymous with falsehood. Thus the French talk of _Des  Romans_, and thus the English use the word Romancing.    But in this sense we had much better use the word falsehood at once. It  is far plainer and clearer. And if in this sense I put anything romantic  before you, pray pay no attention to it, or to me.    30. In the second place. Because young people are particularly apt to  indulge in reverie, and imaginative pleasures, and to neglect their  plain and practical duties, the word romantic has come to signify weak,  foolish, speculative, unpractical, unprincipled. In all these cases it  would be much better to say"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#8)"],[1," council  chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run  in and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old  bricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight  and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the  terraces of the king's garden, where they would shake the rose trees and  the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They explored  all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of  little dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what  they had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling  each other that they were doing as men did. They drank at the tanks and  made the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they  would all rush together in mobs and shout: \"There is no one in the  jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the  Bandar-log.\" Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city  and went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice  them.    Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like  or understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold  Lairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli  would have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about  and sang their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told  his companions that Mowgli's capture marked a new thing in the history  of the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks  and canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked  up some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys  tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began  to pull their friends' tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.    \"I wish to eat,\" said Mowgli. \"I am a stranger in this part of the  jungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.\"    Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild  pawpaws. But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much  trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and  angry as well as hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the  Strangers' Hunting Call from time to time, but no one answered him, and  Mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed. \"All that Baloo  has said about the Bandar-log is true,\" he thought to himself. \"They  have no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish words  and little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here,  it will be all my own fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle.  Baloo will surely beat me, but that is better than chasing silly rose  leaves with the Bandar-log.\"    No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him  back, telling him that he did not know how happy he was, and pinching  him to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but  went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone  reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined  summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for  queens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and  blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the  queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble  tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians  and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it  shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black  velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not  help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him  how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he  was to wish to leave them. \"We are great. We are free. We are wonderful.  We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and  so it must be true,\" they shouted. \"Now as you are a new listener and  can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us  in future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves.\" Mowgli  made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on  the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the  Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would  all shout together: \"This is true; we all say so.\" Mowgli nodded and  blinked, and said \"Yes\" when they asked him a question, and his head  spun with the noise. \"Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these  people,\" he said to himself, \"and now they have madness. Certainly this  is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud  coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might  try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired.\"    That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined  ditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how  dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run  any risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and  few in the jungle care for those odds.    \"I will go to the west wall,\" Kaa whispered, \"and come down swiftly with  the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon  my back in their hundreds, but--\"    \"I know it,\" said Bagheera. \"Would that Baloo were here, but we must do  what we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace.  They hold some sort of council there over the boy.\"    \"Good hunting,\" said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That  happened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed  awhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,  and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheera's light  feet on the terrace. The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost  without a sound and was striking--he knew better than to waste time in  biting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli  in circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage,  and then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him,  a monkey shouted: \"There is only one here! Kill him! Kill.\" A scuffling  mass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over  Bagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up the wall  of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome.  A man-trained boy would have been badly bruised, for the fall was a  good fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and  landed on his feet.    \"Stay there,\" shouted the monkeys, \"till we have killed thy friends, and  later we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.\"    \"We be of one blood, ye and I,\" said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake's  Call. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him  and gave the Call a second time, to make sure.    \"Even ssso! Down hoods all!\" said half a dozen low voices (every ruin  in India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old  summerhouse was alive with cobras). \"Stand still, Little Brother, for  thy feet may do us harm.\"    Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and  listening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther--the  yells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera's deep, hoarse cough  as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his  enemies. For the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for  his life.    \"Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,\" Mowgli  thought. And then he called aloud: \"To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the  water tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!\"    Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new  courage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the  reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the  jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done  his best, but he could not come before. \"Bagheera,\" he shouted, \"I am  here. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my feet! Wait my  coming, O most infamous Bandar-log!\" He panted up the terrace only  to disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself  squarely on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as  many as he could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat,  like the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told  Mowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys  could not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just  out of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps,  dancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon him from all sides  if he came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his  dripping chin, and in despair gave the Snake's Call for protection--\"We  be of one blood, ye and I\"--for he believed that Kaa had turned tail  at the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on  the edge of the terrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black  Panther asking for help.    Kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a  wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch. He had no intention  of losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself  once or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in  working order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the  monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to  and fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even  Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of  the Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to"]]]
