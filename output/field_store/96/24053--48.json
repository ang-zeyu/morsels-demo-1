Help me to choose the better part, and honour       God in all things!         _Aug. 28th._--The labours of another week are ended; during it I       have enjoyed much of the presence of God; surely the religion of       Christ dazzles all the magnificence of human glory; were I only to       regard the happiness of this life, I would embrace its doctrines,       practice its laws, and exert my influence for its extension.         _Aug. 29th.--Sabbath._--The blessings of the Lord have abundantly       surrounded me this day, and my heart has been enlarged.         _Aug. 30th._--In observing my actions and words this day, I find I       have done many things that are culpable; and yet, blessed be God,       his goodness to me is profuse. Help me to watch and pray that I       enter not into temptation.         _Aug. 31st._--How many youths around me do I see trifling away the       greatest part of their time, and profaning their Maker's name? My       soul magnifies His name that I have decided to be on the Lord's       side; how many evils have I escaped; how many blessings obtained;       what praise enjoyed, through the influence of this religion. To God       be all the glory!         _September 1st._--In no subject can we employ our thoughts more       profitably than on the atonement of Christ, and justification       through his merits. With wonder we gaze on the love of Deity; with       profound awe we behold a God descending from heaven to earth.       Unbounded love! Unmeasured grace! And while in deep silence his       death wraps all nature; while his yielding breath rends the temple       and shakes earth's deep foundations; may my redeemed soul in silent       rapture tune her grateful song aloft; and fired by this       blood-bought theme, may I mend my pace towards my heavenly       inheritance!         I generally close up the labours of the day by writing a short       essay or theme on some religious subject. In doing this I have two       objects in view: the improvement of my mind and heart. And what       could be more appropriate than to close the day by reflection upon       God, and heaven, and time, and eternity? No private employment,       except that of prayer, have I found more pleasing and profitable       than this. Youth is the seed-time of the life that now is, as well       as of that which is to come. Youthful piety is the germ of true       honour, lawful prosperity, and everlasting blessedness. One day of       humble, devotional piety in youth will add more to our happiness at       the last end of life than a year of repentance and humiliation in       old age. I have no intention of entering the ministry, and yet I       prefer religious topics. To-day I have chosen the atonement of our       Lord, and have written a few thoughts on it.         _Sept. 2nd._--Implicit trust in a superintending Providence is a       constant source of comfort and support to me.         _Sept. 3rd._--God has blessed me to-day in my studies. I have also       felt the efficacy of Divine aid. Help me still, most merciful God!         _Sept. 4th._--In the course of the past week I have experienced       various feelings, especially with respect to the dealings of Divine       Providence with me; but in all I have had this consolation, that       whatever happens, \"the will of the Lord be done.\" It is my duty to       perform and obey.         _Sept. 5th._--This morning I attended church and heard a sermon on       Ezekiel xviii. 27. When we consider the importance of repentance,       its connection with our eternal happiness, surely every feeling       heart, and ministers especially, should exhibit with burning zeal       the conditions of salvation, the slavery of vice, the heinousness       of sin, the vanity of human glory, and the uncertainty of life.         _Sept. 6th._--When I laid aside my studies to commit my evening       thoughts to paper, my mind wandered on various subjects, until much       time was lost; the best antidote against this is, not to put off to       the next moment what can be done in this. We should be firm and       decided in all our pursuits, and whatever our minds \"find to do, do       it with all our might.\"         _Sept. 7th._--The mutual dependence of men cements society, and       their social intercourse communicates pleasure. If we are called to       endure the pains and inconveniences of poverty, possessing this we       forget all; and in the pleasant walks of wealth, it adds to every       elegance a charm. Friendship associated with religion, elevates all       the ties of Christian love and mutual pleasure.         _Sept. 8th._--I have found myself too much mingled with the common       crowd, and like others, too indifferent to the subject of all       others the chief.         _Sept. 9th._--We \"cannot serve God and Mammon.\" May I be firm in my       attachment to the Saviour, remembering that \"godliness has the       promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.\"         _Sept. 12th._--I heard a practical sermon on making our \"calling       and election sure,\" which closed with these words, \"He that calleth       upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" I felt condemned on       account of my negligence, and resolved, by God's help, to gain       victory over my tendency to inconsistencies of life and conduct.         _Sept. 14th._--I observe men embarked on the stream of time, and       carried forward with irresistible force to that universal port       which shall receive the whole human family. Amongst this passing       crowd, how few are there who reflect upon the design and end of       their voyage; surfeited with pleasure, involved in life's busy       concerns, the future, with its awful realities, is forgotten and       time, not eternity, is placed in the foreground.         _Sept, 15th._--In a letter to my brother George, to-day, I       said:--It would be superfluous for me to tell you that the letter I       received from you gave me unspeakable pleasure. Your fears with       respect to my injuring my health are groundless, for I must confess       I don't possess half that application and burning zeal in these       all-important pursuits that I ought to have. For who can estimate       the value of a liberal education? Who can sufficiently prize that       in which all the powers of the human mind can expand to their       utmost and astonishing extent? What industry can outstretch the       worth of that knowledge, by which we can travel back to the       remotest ages, and live the lives of all antiquity? Nay, who can       set bounds to the value of those attainments, by which we can, as       it were, fly from world to world, and gaze on all the glories of       creation; by which we can glide down the stream of time, and       penetrate the unorganized regions of uncreated futurity? My heart       burns while I write. Although literature presents the highest       objects of ambition to the most refined mind, yet I consider       health, in comparison with other temporal enjoyments, the most       bountiful, and highest gift of heaven.         I have read three books of the Georgics, and three odes of Horace,       but this last week I have read scarcely any, as I have had a great       deal of company, and there has been no school. But I commence again       to-day with all my might. The Attorney-General stops at Mr.       Aikman's during Court. I find him very agreeable. He conversed with       me more than an hour last night, in the most sociable, open manner       possible.         _Sept. 16th._--There is nothing of greater importance than to       commence early to form our characters and regulate our conduct.       Observation daily proves that man's condition in this world is       generally the result of his own conduct. When we come to maturity,       we perceive there is a right and a wrong in the actions of men;       many who possess the same hereditary advantages, are not equally       prosperous in life; some by virtuous conduct rise to       respectability, honour, and happiness; while others by mean and       vicious actions, forfeit the advantages of their birth, and sink       into ignominy and disgrace. How necessary that in early life useful       habits should be formed, and turbulent passions restrained, so that       when manhood and old age come, the mind be not enervated by the       follies and vices of youth, but, supported and strengthened by the       Divine Being, be enabled to say, \"O God, thou hast taught me from       my youth, and now when I am old and grey-headed, O God, thou wilt       not forsake me!\"         _Sept. 21st._--I have just parted with an old and faithful friend,       who has left for another kingdom. How often has he kindly reproved       me, and how oft have we gone to the house of God together! We may       never meet again on earth, but what a mercy to have a good hope of       meeting in the better land!         _Sept. 23rd._--When I reflect on the millions of the human family       who know nothing of Christ, my soul feels intensely for their       deliverance. What a vast uncultivated field in my own country for       ministers to employ their whole time and talents in exalting a       crucified Saviour. Has God designed this sacred task for me? If it       be Thy will, may all obstacles be removed, my heart be sanctified       and my hands made pure.         _Sept. 26th._--I have been much oppressed with a man-fearing       spirit, but what have I to fear if God be for me? Oh, Lord, enable       me to become a bold witness for Jesus Christ!         _Sept. 28th._--In all the various walks of life, I find       obstructions and labours, surrounded with foes, powerful as well       as subtle; although I have all the promises of the Gospel to       comfort and support me, yet find exertion on my own part absolutely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#8)"],[1,"goods. My friend in Stamboul continually  sent me fresh supplies, and I became richer from day to day. At last  when I had husbanded so well, that I believed myself able to venture on  some more extensive undertaking, I went with my wares into Italy. I  must, however, mention something that brought me in no little money; I  called my profession also to my assistance. As soon as I arrived in a  city I announced, by means of bills, that a Grecian physician was  there, who had already cured many; and, truly, my balsam, and my  medicines, had brought me in many a zechin.    Thus at last I reached the city of Florence, in Italy. I proposed to  myself to remain longer than usual in this place, partly because it  pleased me so well, partly, moreover, that I might recover from the  fatigues of my journey. I hired myself a shop in the quarter of the  city called St. Croce, and in a tavern not far therefrom, took a  couple of fine rooms which led out upon a balcony. Immediately I had  my bills carried around, which announced me as a physician and  merchant. I had no sooner opened my shop than buyers streamed in upon  me, and although I asked a tolerably high price, still I sold more  than others, because I was attentive and friendly to my customers.    Well satisfied, I had spent four days in Florence, when one evening,  after I had shut my shop, and according to custom was examining my  stock of ointment-boxes, I found, in one of the smaller ones, a letter  which I did not remember to have put in. I opened it and found therein  an invitation to repair that night, punctually at twelve, to the  bridge called the Ponte Vecchio. For some time I reflected upon this,  as to who it could be that had thus invited me; as, however, I knew  not a soul in Florence, I thought, as had often happened already, that  one wished to lead me privately to some sick person. Accordingly I  resolved to go; nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, I put on  the sabre which my father had given me. As it was fast approaching  midnight, I set out upon my way, and soon arrived at the Ponte  Vecchio; I found the bridge forsaken and desolate, and resolved to  wait until it should appear who had addressed me.    It was a cold night; the moon shone clear as I looked down upon the  waters of the Arno, which sparkled in her light. On the church of the  city the twelfth hour was sounding, when I looked up, and before me  stood a tall man, entirely covered with a red cloak, a corner of which  he held before his face. At this sudden apparition I was at first  somewhat startled, but I soon recovered myself and said--    \"If you have summoned me hither, tell me, what is your pleasure?\"    The Red-mantle turned, and solemnly ejaculated, \"Follow!\"    My mind was nevertheless somewhat uneasy at the idea of going alone  with this Unknown; I stood still and said, \"Not so, dear sir; you will  first tell me whither; moreover, you may show me your face a little,  that I may see whether you have good intentions towards me.\"    The Stranger, however, appeared not to be concerned thereat. \"If thou  wishest it not, Zaleukos, then remain!\" answered he, moving away. At  this my anger burned.    \"Think you,\" I cried, \"that I will suffer a man to play the fool with  me, and wait here this cold night for nothing?\" In three bounds I  reached him; crying still louder, I seized him by the cloak, laying  the other hand upon my sabre; but the mantle remained in my hand, and  the Unknown vanished around the nearest corner. My anger gradually  cooled; I still had the cloak, and this should furnish the key to this  strange adventure. I put it on, and moved towards home. Before I had  taken a hundred steps, somebody passed very near, and whispered in the  French tongue, \"Observe, Count, to-night, we can do nothing.\" Before I  could look around, this somebody had passed, and I saw only a shadow  hovering near the houses. That this exclamation was addressed to the  mantle, and not to me, I plainly perceived; nevertheless, this threw  no light upon the matter. Next morning I considered what was best to  be done. At first I thought of having proclamation made respecting  the cloak, that I had found it; but in that case the Unknown could  send for it by a third person, and I would have no explanation of the  matter. While thus meditating I took a nearer view of the garment. It  was of heavy Genoese velvet, of dark red color, bordered with fur from  Astrachan, and richly embroidered with gold. The gorgeousness of the  cloak suggested to me a plan, which I resolved to put in execution. I  carried it to my shop and offered it for sale, taking care, however,  to set so high a price upon it, that I would be certain to find no  purchaser. My object in this was to fix my eye keenly upon every one  who should come to inquire after it; for the figure of the Unknown,  which, after the loss of the mantle, had been exposed to me distinctly  though transiently, I could recognise out of thousands. Many merchants  came after the cloak, the extraordinary beauty of which drew all eyes  upon it; but none bore the slightest resemblance to the Unknown, none  would give for it the high price of two hundred zechins. It was  surprising to me, that when I asked one and another whether there was  a similar mantle in Florence, all answered in the negative, and  protested that they had never seen such costly and elegant  workmanship.    It was just becoming evening, when at last there came a young man who  had often been in there, and had also that very day bid high for the  mantle; he threw upon the table a bag of zechins, exclaiming--    \"By Heaven! Zaleukos, I must have your mantle, should I be made a  beggar by it.\" Immediately he began to count out his gold pieces. I  was in a great dilemma; I had exposed the mantle, in order thereby to  get a sight of my unknown friend, and now came a young simpleton to  give the unheard-of price. Nevertheless, what remained for me? I  complied, for on the other hand the reflection consoled me, that my  night adventure would be so well rewarded. The young man put on the  cloak and departed; he turned, however, upon the threshold, while he  loosened a paper which was attached to the collar, and threw it  towards me, saying, \"Here, Zaleukos, hangs something, that does not  properly belong to my purchase.\" Indifferently, I received the note;  but lo! these were the contents:--    \"This night, at the hour thou knowest, bring the mantle to the Ponte  Vecchio; four hundred zechins await thee!\"    I stood as one thunder-struck: thus had I trifled with fortune, and  entirely missed my aim. Nevertheless, I reflected not long; catching  up the two hundred zechins, I bounded to the side of the young man and  said, \"Take your zechins again, my good friend, and leave me the  cloak; I cannot possibly part with it.\"    At first he treated the thing as a jest, but when he saw it was  earnest, he fell in a passion at my presumption, and called me a fool;  and thus at last we came to blows. I was fortunate enough to seize the  mantle in the scuffle, and was already making off with it, when the  young man called the police to his assistance, and had both of us  carried before a court of justice. The magistrate was much astonished  at the accusation, and adjudged the cloak to my opponent. I however,  offered the young man twenty, fifty, eighty, at last a hundred,  zechins, in addition to his two hundred, if he would surrender it to  me. What my entreaties could not accomplish, my gold did. He took my  good zechins, while I went off in triumph with the mantle, obliged to  be satisfied with being taken for a madman by every one in Florence.  Nevertheless, the opinion of the people was a matter of indifference  to me, for I knew better than they, that I would still gain by the  bargain.    With impatience I awaited the night; at the same hour as the preceding  day, I proceeded to the Ponte Vecchio, the mantle under my arm. With  the last stroke of the clock, came the figure out of darkness to my  side: beyond a doubt it was the man of the night before.    \"Hast thou the cloak?\" I was asked.    \"Yes, sir,\" I replied, \"but it cost me a hundred zechins cash.\"    \"I know it,\" rejoined he; \"look, here are four hundred.\" He moved with  me to the broad railing of the bridge and counted out the gold pieces;  brightly they glimmered in the moonshine, their lustre delighted my  heart--ah! it did not foresee that this was to be its last joy. I put  the money in my pocket, and then wished to get a good view of the  generous stranger, but he had a mask before his face, through which  two dark eyes frightfully beamed upon me.    \"I thank you, sir, for your kindness,\" said I to him; \"what further  desire you of me? I told you before, however, that it must be nothing  evil.\"    \"Unnecessary trouble,\" answered he, throwing the cloak over his  shoulders; \"I needed your assistance as a physician, nevertheless not  for a living, but for a dead person.\"    \"How can that be?\" exclaimed I in amazement.    \"I came with my sister from a distant land,\" rejoined he, at the same  time motioning me to follow him, \"and took up my abode with a friend  of our family. A sudden disease carried off my sister yesterday, and  our relations wished to bury her this morning. According to an old  usage of our family, however, all are to repose in the sepulchre of  our fathers; many who have died in foreign lands, nevertheless sleep  there embalmed. To my relations now I grant the body, but to my father  must I bring at least the head of his daughter, that he may see it  once again.\"    In this custom of severing the head from near relatives there was to  me, indeed, something awful; nevertheless, I ventured to say nothing  against it, through fear of offending the Unknown. I told him,  therefore, that I was well acquainted with the art of embalming the  dead, and asked him to lead me to the body. Notwithstanding, I could  not keep"]]]
