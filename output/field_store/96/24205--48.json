A majority of the slain  were women and children. Abolitionists who had lived in slave States  never indulged in flippant remarks fitted to incite insurrection. This  was reserved for the few agitators far removed from the scene of action.         * Schouler, \"History of the United States under the       Constitution,\" vol. V, p. 217.    Southern planters who had determined at all hazards to perpetuate the  institution of slavery were peculiarly sensitive on account of what was  taking place in Spanish America and in the British West Indies. Mexico  abolished slavery in 1829, and united with Colombia in encouraging Cuba  to throw off the Spanish yoke, abolish slavery, and join the sisterhood  of New World republics. This led to an effective protest on the part of  the United States. Both Spain and Mexico were advised that the  United States could not with safety to its own interests permit the  emancipation of slaves in the island of Cuba. But with the British  Emancipation Act of 1833, Cuba became the only neighboring territory in  which slavery was legal. These acts of emancipation added zeal to the  determination of the Southern planters to secure territory for the  indefinite extension of slavery to the southwest. When Lundy and Birney  discovered these plans, their desire to husband and extend the direct  political influence of abolitionists was greatly stimulated. To this  end they maintained a moderate and conservative attitude. They took  care that no abuse or misrepresentation should betray them into any  expression which would diminish their influence with fair-minded,  reasonable men. They were convinced that a clear and complete revelation  of the facts would lead a majority of the people to adopt their views.    The debate in the Virginia Legislature in the session which met three  months after the Southampton massacre furnishes a demonstration that the  traditional anti-slavery sentiment still persisted among the rulers of  the Old Dominion. It arose out of a petition from the Quakers of the  State asking for an investigation preparatory to a gradual emancipation  of the slaves. The debate, which lasted for several weeks, was able and  thorough. No stronger utterances in condemnation of slavery were ever  voiced than appear in this debate. Different speakers made the statement  that no one presumed to defend slavery on principle--that apologists for  slavery existed but no defenders. Opposition to the petition was in the  main apologetic in tone.    A darker picture of the blighting effects of slavery on the industries  of the country was never drawn than appears in these speeches. Slavery  was declared to be driving free laborers from the State, to have already  destroyed every industry except agriculture, and to have exhausted the  soil so that profitable agriculture was becoming extinct, while pine  brush was encroaching upon former fruitful fields. \"Even the wolf,\" said  one, \"driven back long since by the approach of man, now returns, after  the lapse of a hundred years, to howl over the desolations of slavery.\"  Contrasts between free labor in northern industry and that of the South  were vividly portrayed. In a speech of great power, one member referred  to Kentucky and Ohio as States \"providentially designated to exhibit in  their future histories the differences which necessarily result from a  country free from, and a country afflicted with the curse of slavery.\"    The debate was by no means confined to industrial or material  considerations. McDowell, who was afterwards elected Governor of the  State, thus portrays the personal relations of master and slave \"You  may place the slave where you please--you may put him under any process,  which, without destroying his value as a slave, will debase and crush  him as a rational being--you may do all this, and the idea that he  was born to be free will survive it all. It is allied to his hope of  immortality--it is the ethereal part of his nature which oppression  cannot reach--it is a torch lit up in his soul by the hand of the Deity,  and never meant to be extinguished by the hand of man.\"    Various speakers assumed that the continuance of slavery involved a  bloody conflict; that either peaceably or through violence, slavery  as contrary to the spirit of the age must come to an end; that the  agitation against it could not be suppressed. Faulkner drew a lurid  picture of the danger from servile insurrection, in which he referred to  the utterances of two former speakers, one of whom had said that, unless  something effective was done to ward off the danger, \"the throats of all  the white people of Virginia will be cut.\" The other replied, \"No, the  whites cannot be conquered--the throats of the blacks will be cut.\"  Faulkner's rejoinder was that the difference was a trifling one, \"for  the fact is conceded that one race or the other must be exterminated.\"    The public press joined in the debate. Leading editorials appeared in  the Richmond Enquirer urging that effective measures be instituted to  put an end to slavery. The debate aroused much interest throughout the  South. Substantially all the current abolition arguments appeared in the  speeches of the slave-owning members of the Virginia Legislature. And  what was done about it? Nothing at all. The petition was not granted;  no action looking towards emancipation was taken. This was indeed a  turning-point. Men do not continue to denounce in public their own  conduct unless their action results in some effort toward corrective  measures.    Professor Thomas Dew, of the chair of history and metaphysics in William  and Mary College and later President of the College, published an essay  reviewing the debate in the Legislature and arguing that any plan for  emancipation in Virginia was either undesirable or impossible.  This essay was among the first of the direct pro-slavery arguments.  Statements in support of the view soon followed. In 1835 the Governor of  South Carolina in a message to the Legislature said, \"Domestic slavery  is the corner-stone of our republican edifice.\" Senator Calhoun,  speaking in the Senate two years later, declared slavery to be a  positive good. W. G. Simms, Southern poet and novelist, writing in 1852,  felicitates himself as being among the first who about fifteen years  earlier advocated slavery as a great good and a blessing. Harriet  Martineau, an English author who traveled extensively in the South in  1885, found few slaveholders who justified the institution as being in  itself just. But after the debates in the Virginia Legislature, there  were few owners of slaves who publicly advocated abolition. The spirit  of mob violence had set in, and, contrary to the utterances of Virginia  statesmen, free speech on the subject of slavery was suppressed in the  slave States. This did not mean that Southern statesmen had lost  the power to perceive the evil effects of slavery or that they were  convinced that their former views were erroneous. It meant simply that  they had failed to agree upon a policy of gradual emancipation, and the  only recourse left seemed to be to follow the example of James G. Birney  and leave the South or to submit in silence to the new order.        CHAPTER V. THE VINDICATION OF LIBERTY    With the changed attitude of the South towards emancipation there was  associated an active hostility to dearly bought human liberty. Freedom  of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of worship, the right of  assembly, trial by jury, the right of petition, free use of the mails,  and numerous other fundamental human rights were assailed. Birney  and other abolitionists who had immediate knowledge of slavery early  perceived that the real question at issue was quite as much the  continued liberty of the white man as it was the liberation of the black  man and that the enslavement of one race involved also the ultimate  essential enslavement of the other.    In 1831 two slave States and six free States still extended to free  negroes the right to vote. During the pro-slavery crusade these  privileges disappeared; and not only so, but free negroes were banished  from certain States, or were not permitted to enter them, or were  allowed to remain only by choosing a white man for a guardian. It was  made a crime to teach negroes, whether slaves or free men, to read and  write. Under various pretexts free negroes were reduced to slavery.  Freedom of worship was denied to negroes, and they were not allowed to  assemble for any purpose except under the strict surveillance of white  men. Negro testimony in a court of law was invalid where the rights of a  white man were involved. The right of a negro to his freedom was decided  by an arbitrary court without a jury, while the disputed right of a  white man to the ownership of a horse was conditioned by the safeguard  of trial by jury.    The maintenance of such policies carries with it of necessity the  suppression of free discussion. When Southern leaders adopted the policy  of defending slavery as a righteous institution, abolitionists in the  South either emigrated to the North or were silenced. In either case  they were deprived of a fundamental right. The spirit of persecution  followed them into the free States. Birney could not publish his paper  in Kentucky, nor even at Cincinnati, save at the risk of his life.  Elijah Lovejoy was not allowed to publish his paper in Missouri,  and, when he persisted in publishing it in Illinois, he was brutally  murdered. Even in Boston it required men of courage and determination  to meet and organize an anti-slavery society in 1832, though only a  few years earlier Benjamin Lundy had traveled freely through the South  itself delivering anti-slavery lectures and organizing scores of such  societies. The New York Anti-Slavery Society was secretly organized in  1832 in spite of the opposition of a determined mob.

CHALMERS IN LONDON.    When Dr. Chalmers first visited London, the hold that he took on the  minds of men was unprecedented. It was a time of strong political  feeling; but even that was unheeded, and all parties thronged to hear  the Scottish preacher. The very best judges were not prepared for the  display that they heard. Canning and Wilberforce went together, and got  into a pew near the door. The elder in attendance stood alone by the  pew. Chalmers began in his usual unpromising way, by stating a few  nearly self-evident propositions, neither in the choicest language, nor  in the most impressive voice. \"If this be all,\" said Canning to his  companion, \"it will never do.\" Chalmers went on--the shuffling of the  conversation gradually subsided. He got into the mass of his subject;  his weakness became strength, his hesitation was turned into energy;  and, bringing the whole volume of his mind to bear upon it, he poured  forth a torrent of the most close and conclusive argument, brilliant  with all the exuberance of an imagination which ranged over all nature  for illustrations, and yet managed and applied each of them with the  same unerring dexterity, as if that single one had been the study of a  whole life. \"The tartan beats us,\" said Mr. Canning; \"we have no  preaching like that in England.\"           *       *       *       *       *      ROMILLY AND BROUGHAM.    Hallam's _History of the Middle Ages_ was the last book of any  importance read by Sir Samuel Romilly. Of this excellent work he formed  the highest opinion, and recommended its immediate perusal to Lord  Brougham, as a contrast to his dry _Letter on the Abuses of Charities_,  in respect of the universal interest of the subject. Yet, Sir Samuel  undervalued the Letter, for it ran through eight editions in one month.           *       *       *       *       *      PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONISTS.    It is remarkable, (says Bulwer, in his _Zanoni_,) that most of the  principal actors of the French Revolution were singularly hideous in  appearance--from the colossal ugliness of Mirabeau and Danton, or the  villanous ferocity in the countenances of David and Simon, to the filthy  squalor of Marat, and the sinister and bilious meanness of the Dictator's  features. But Robespierre, who was said to resemble a cat, and had also  a cat's cleanliness, was prim and dainty in dress, shaven smoothness,  and the womanly whiteness of his hands. Rene Dumas, born of reputable  parents, and well educated, despite his ferocity, was not without a  certain refinement, which perhaps rendered him the more acceptable to  the precise Robespierre. Dumas was a beau in his way: his gala-dress  was a _blood-red_ coat, with the finest ruffles. But Henriot had been a  lacquey, a thief, a spy of the police; he had drank the blood of Madame  de Lamballe, and had risen for no quality but his ruffianism; and Fouquier  Tinville, the son of a provincial agriculturist, and afterwards a clerk  at the bureau of the police, was little less base in his manners, and  yet more, from a certain loathsome buffoonery, revolting in his speech;  bull-headed, with black, sleek hair, with a narrow and livid forehead,  and small eyes that twinkled with sinister malice; strongly and coarsely  built, he looked what he was, the audacious bully of a lawless and  relentless bar.           *       *       *       *       *      DEATH OF SIR CHARLES BELL.    This distinguished surgeon died suddenly on April 29, 1842, at Hallow  Park, near Worcester, while on his way to Malvern. He was out sketching  on the 28th, being particularly pleased with the village church, and  some fine trees which are beside it; observing that he should like to  repose there when he was gone. Just four days after this sentiment had  been expressed, his mortal remains were accordingly deposited beside the  rustic graves which had attracted his notice, and so recently occupied  his pencil. There is a painful admonition in this fulfilment.           *       *       *       *       *      CLASSIC PUN.    It was suggested to a distinguished _gourmet_, what a capital thing a  dish all fins (turbot's fins) might be made. \"Capital,\" said he; \"dine  with me on it to-morrow.\" \"Accepted.\" Would you believe it? when the  cover was removed, the sacrilegious dog of an Amphytrion had put into  the dish \"Cicero _De finibus_\" \"There is a work all fins,\" said he.           *       *       *       *       *      POETRY OF THE SEA.    Campbell was a great lover of submarine prospects. \"Often in my  boyhood,\" says the poet, \"when the day has been bright and the sea  transparent, I have sat by the hour on a Highland rock admiring the  golden sands, the emerald weeds, and the silver shells at the bottom of  the bay beneath, till, dreaming about the grottoes of the Nereids, I  would not have exchanged my pleasure for that of a connoisseur poring  over a landscape by Claude or Poussin. Enchanting nature! thy beauty is  not only in heaven and earth, but in the waters under our feet. How  magnificent a medium of vision is the pellucid sea! Is it not like  poetry, that embellishes every object that we contemplate?\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"FELON LITERATURE.\"    One of the most stinging reproofs of perverted literary taste, evidently  aimed at Newgate Calendar literature, appeared in the form of a  valentine, in No. 31 of _Punch_, in 1842.    The valentine itself reminds one of Churchill's muse; and it needs no  finger to tell where its withering satire is pointed:--       \"THE LITERARY GENTLEMAN.       \"Illustrious scribe! whose vivid genius strays 'Mid Drury's stews      to incubate her lays, And in St. Giles's slang conveys her tropes,      Wreathing the poet's lines with hangmen's ropes; You who conceive      'tis poetry to teach The sad bravado of a dying speech; Or, when      possessed with a sublimer mood, Show \"Jack o'Dandies\" dancing upon      blood! Crush bones--bruise flesh, recount each festering sore--      Rake up the plague-pit, write--and write in gore! Or, when      inspired to humanize mankind, Where doth your soaring soul its      subjects find? Not 'mid the scenes that simple Goldsmith sought,      And found a theme to elevate his thought; But you, great scribe,      more greedy of renown, From Hounslow's gibbet drag a hero down.      Imbue his mind with virtue; make him quote Some moral truth before      he cuts a throat. Then wash his hands, and soaring o'er your      craft--Refresh the hero with a bloody draught: And, fearing lest      the world should miss the act, With noble zeal _italicize_ the      fact. Or would you picture woman meek and pure, By love and virtue      tutor'd to endure, With cunning skill you take a felon's trull,      Stuff her with sentiment, and scrunch her skull! Oh! would your      crashing, smashing, mashing pen were mine, That I could \"scorch      your eyeballs\" with my words,       \"MY VALENTINE.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DEATH BED REVELATIONS.    Men before they die see and comprehend enigmas hidden from them before.  The greatest poet, and one of the noblest thinkers of the last age, said  on his death-bed:--\"Many things obscure to me before, now clear up and  become visible.\"           *       *       *       *       *      STAMMERING WIT.    Stammering, (says Coleridge,) is sometimes the cause of a pun. Some one  was mentioning in Lamb's presence the cold-heartedness of the Duke of  Cumberland, in restraining the duchess from rushing up to the embrace of  her son, whom she had not seen for a considerable time, and insisting  on her receiving him in state. \"How horribly _cold_ it was,\" said the  narrator. \"Yes,\" said Lamb, in his stuttering way; \"but you know he is  the Duke of _Cu-cum-ber-land_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      ORIGIN OF BOTTLED ALE.    Alexander Newell, Dean of St. Paul's, and Master of Westminster School,  in the reign of Queen Mary, was an excellent angler. But Fuller says,  while Newell was catching of fishes, Bishop Bonner was catching of  Newell, and would certainly have sent him to the shambles, had not a  good London merchant conveyed him away upon the seas. Newell was fishing  upon the banks of the Thames when he received the first intimation of  his danger, which was so pressing, that he dared not go back to his own  house to make any preparation for his flight. Like an honest angler, he  had taken with him provisions for the day; and when, in the first year  of England's deliverance, he returned to his country, and to his own  haunts, he remembered that on the day of his flight he had left a bottle  of beer in a safe place on the bank: there he looked for it, and \"found  it no bottle, but a gun--such the sound at the opening thereof; and this  (says Fuller) is believed (casualty is mother of more invention than  industry) to be the original of bottled ale in England.\"           *       *       *       *       *      BAD'S THE BEST.    Canning was once asked by an English clergyman, at whose parsonage he  was visiting, how he liked the sermon he had preached that morning.  \"Why, it was a short sermon,\" quoth Canning. \"O yes,\" said the preacher,  \"you know I avoid being tedious.\" \"Ah, but,\" replied Canning, \"you  _were_ tedious.\"           *       *       *       *       *      LUDICROUS ESTIMATE OF MR. CANNING.    The Rev. Sydney Smith compares Mr. Canning in office to a fly in amber:  \"nobody cares about the fly: the only question is, how the devil did it  get there?\" \"Nor do I,\" continues Smith, \"attack him for the love of  glory, but from the love of utility, as a burgomaster hunts a rat in a  Dutch dyke, for fear it should flood a province.
