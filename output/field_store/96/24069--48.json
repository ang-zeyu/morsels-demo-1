I want you  all--all--at Greenwood and I will do the best I can for you all.\"    \"Oh, Uncle Paul,\" cried Worth, her face aglow and quivering with  smiles and tears and sunshine.    \"Do you think she will forgive me and come?\"    \"I know she will,\" cried Worth. \"I know how she has longed for you and  home. Oh, I am so happy, Uncle Paul!\"    He smiled at her and put his arm over her shoulder. Together they  walked up the golden arcade to tell the others. That night Charlotte  and Ellen cried with happiness as they talked it over in the twilight.    \"How beautiful!\" murmured Charlotte softly. \"We shall not lose Worth  after all. Ellen, I could not have borne it to see that girl go  utterly out of our lives again.\"    \"I always hoped and believed that Elizabeth's child would somehow  bring us all together again,\" said Ellen happily.          Freda's Adopted Grave      North Point, where Freda lived, was the bleakest settlement in the  world. Even its inhabitants, who loved it, had to admit that. The  northeast winds swept whistling up the bay and blew rawly over the  long hill that sloped down to it, blighting everything that was in  their way. Only the sturdy firs and spruces could hold their own  against it. So there were no orchards or groves or flower gardens in  North Point.    Just over the hill, in a sheltered southwest valley, was the North  Point church with the graveyard behind it, and this graveyard was the  most beautiful spot in North Point or near it. The North Point folk  loved flowers. They could not have them about their homes, so they had  them in their graveyard. It was a matter of pride with each family to  keep the separate plot neatly trimmed and weeded and adorned with  beautiful blossoms.    It was one of the unwritten laws of the little community that on some  selected day in May everybody would repair to the graveyard to plant,  trim and clip. It was not an unpleasant duty, even to those whose  sorrow was fresh. It seemed as if they were still doing something for  the friends who had gone when they made their earthly resting places  beautiful.    As for the children, they looked forward to \"Graveyard Day\" as a very  delightful anniversary, and it divided its spring honours with the  amount of the herring catch.    \"Tomorrow is Graveyard Day,\" said Minnie Hutchinson at school recess,  when all the little girls were sitting on the fence. \"Ain't I glad!  I've got the loveliest big white rosebush to plant by Grandma  Hutchinson's grave. Uncle Robert sent it out from town.\"    \"My mother has ten tuberoses to set out,\" said Nan Gray proudly.    \"We're going to plant a row of lilies right around our plot,\" said  Katie Morris.    Every little girl had some boast to make, that is, every little girl  but Freda. Freda sat in a corner all by herself and felt miserably  outside of everything. She had no part or lot in Graveyard Day.    \"Are you going to plant anything, Freda?\" asked Nan, with a wink at  the others.    Freda shook her head mutely.    \"Freda can't plant anything,\" said Winnie Bell cruelly, although she  did not mean to be cruel. \"She hasn't got a grave.\"    Just then Freda felt as if her gravelessness were a positive disgrace  and crime, as if not to have an interest in a single grave in North  Point cemetery branded you as an outcast forever and ever. It very  nearly did in North Point. The other little girls pitied Freda, but at  the same time they rather looked down upon her for it with the  complacency of those who had been born into a good heritage of family  graves and had an undisputed right to celebrate Graveyard Day.    Freda felt that her cup of wretchedness was full. She sat miserably on  the fence while the other girls ran off to play, and she walked home  alone at night. It seemed to her that she could _not_ bear it any  longer.    Freda was ten years old. Four years ago Mrs. Wilson had taken her from  the orphan asylum in town. Mrs. Wilson lived just this side of the  hill from the graveyard, and everybody in North Point called her a  \"crank.\" They pitied any child she took, they said. It would be worked  to death and treated like a slave. At first they tried to pump Freda  concerning Mrs. Wilson's treatment of her, but Freda was not to be  pumped. She was a quiet little mite, with big, wistful dark eyes that  had a disconcerting fashion of looking the gossips out of countenance.  But if Freda had been disposed to complain, the North Point people  would have found out that they had been only too correct in their  predictions.    \"Mrs. Wilson,\" Freda said timidly that night, \"why haven't we got a  grave?\"    Mrs. Wilson averred that such a question gave her the \"creeps.\"    \"You ought to be very thankful that we haven't,\" she said severely.  \"That Graveyard Day is a heathenish custom, anyhow. They make a  regular picnic of it, and it makes me sick to hear those school girls  chattering about what they mean to plant, each one trying to outblow  the other. If I _had_ a grave there, I wouldn't make a flower garden  of it!\"    Freda did not go to the graveyard the next day, although it was a  holiday. But in the evening, when everybody had gone home, she crept  over the hill and through the beech grove to see what had been done.  The plots were all very neat and prettily set out with plants and  bulbs. Some perennials were already in bud. The grave of Katie Morris'  great-uncle, who had been dead for forty years, was covered with  blossoming purple pansies. Every grave, no matter how small or old,  had its share of promise--every grave except one. Freda came across it  with a feeling of surprise. It was away down in the lower corner where  there were no plots. It was shut off from the others by a growth of  young poplars and was sunken and overgrown with blueberry shrubs.  There was no headstone, and it looked dismally neglected. Freda felt a  sympathy for it. She had no grave, and this grave had nobody to tend  it or care for it.    When she went home she asked Mrs. Wilson whose it was.    \"Humph!\" said Mrs. Wilson. \"If you have so much spare time lying round  loose, you'd better put it into your sewing instead of prowling about  graveyards. Do you expect me to work my fingers to the bone making  clothes for you? I wish I'd left you in the asylum. That grave is  Jordan Slade's, I suppose. He died twenty years ago, and a worthless,  drunken scamp he was. He served a term in the penitentiary for  breaking into Andrew Messervey's store, and after it he had the face  to come back to North Point. But respectable people would have nothing  to do with him, and he went to the dogs altogether--had to be buried  on charity when he died. He hasn't any relations here. There was a  sister, a little girl of ten, who used to live with the Cogswells over  at East Point. After Jord died, some rich folks saw her and was so  struck with her good looks that they took her away with them. I don't  know what become of her, and I don't care. Go and bring the cows up.\"    When Freda went to bed that night her mind was made up. She would  adopt Jordan Slade's grave.    Thereafter, Freda spent her few precious spare-time moments in the  graveyard. She clipped the blueberry shrubs and long, tangled grasses  from the grave with a pair of rusty old shears that blistered her  little brown hands badly. She brought ferns from the woods to plant  about it. She begged a root of heliotrope from Nan Gray, a clump of  day lilies from Katie Morris, a rosebush slip from Nellie Bell, some  pansy seed from old Mrs. Bennett, and a geranium shoot from Minnie  Hutchinson's big sister. She planted, weeded and watered faithfully,  and her efforts were rewarded. \"Her\" grave soon looked as nice as any  in the graveyard.    Nobody but Freda knew about it. The poplar growth concealed the corner  from sight, and everybody had quite forgotten poor, disreputable  Jordan Slade's grave. At least, it seemed as if everybody had. But one  evening, when Freda slipped down to the graveyard with a little can  of water and rounded the corner of the poplars, she saw a lady  standing by the grave--a strange lady dressed in black, with the  loveliest face Freda had ever seen, and tears in her eyes.    The lady gave a little start when she saw Freda with her can of water.    \"Can you tell me who has been looking after this grave?\" she said.    \"It--it was I,\" faltered Freda, wondering if the lady would be angry  with her. \"Pleas'm, it was I, but I didn't mean any harm. All the  other little girls had a grave, and I hadn't any, so I just adopted  this one.\"    \"Did you know whose it was?\" asked the lady gently.    \"Yes'm--Jordan Slade's. Mrs. Wilson told me.\"    \"Jordan Slade was my brother,\" said the lady. \"He went sadly astray,  but he was not all bad. He was weak and too easily influenced. But  whatever his faults, he was good and kind--oh! so good and kind--to me  when I was a child. I loved him with all my heart. It has always been  my wish to come back and visit his grave, but I have never been able  to come, my home has been so far away. I expected to find it  neglected. I cannot tell you how pleased and touched I am to find it  kept so beautifully. Thank you over and over again, my dear child!\"    \"Then you're not cross, ma'am?\" said Freda eagerly. \"And I may go on  looking after it, may I? Oh, it just seems as if I couldn't bear not  to!\"    \"You may look after it as long as you want to, my dear. I will help  you, too. I am to be at East Point all summer. This will be our  grave--yours and mine.\"    That summer was a wonderful one for Freda. She had found a firm friend  in Mrs. Halliday. The latter was a wealthy woman. Her husband had died  a short time previously and she had no children. When she went away in  the fall, Freda went with her \"to be her own little girl for always.\"  Mrs. Wilson consented grudgingly to give Freda up, although she  grumbled a great deal about ingratitude.

He said he loved her better than his life and  always would, and could never forget her, but he knew she didn't care  anything about him now after the way she'd acted, and he wanted to get  as far away from her and the torturing thought of her as he could. So  he was going to Klondike--going to Klondike, Nora May, when his mother  was writing to him to come home every week and Anne was breaking her  heart for him at St. Mary's.    Well, I folded up them letters and, says I, \"Grandpa Holland, I guess  my birthday celebration is here ready to hand.\" I thought real hard. I  couldn't write myself to explain to those two people that they each  thought the world of each other still--my hands are too stiff; and I  couldn't get anyone else to write because I couldn't let out what  they'd told me in confidence. So I did a mean, dishonourable thing,  Nora May. I sent Anne's letter to Gilbert and Gilbert's to Anne. I  asked Emma Matilda to address them, and Emma Matilda did it and asked  no questions. I brought her up that way.    Then I settled down to wait. In less than a month Gilbert's mother had  a letter from him saying that he was coming home to settle down and  marry Anne. He arrived home yesterday and last night Anne came to  Springdale on her way home from St. Mary's. They came to see me this  morning and said things to me I ain't going to repeat because they  would sound fearful vain. They were so happy that they made me feel as  if it was a good thing to have lived eighty years in a world where  folks could be so happy. They said their new joy was my birthday gift  to them. The wedding is to be in September and I'm going to Montrose  in August to help Anne with her quilts. I don't think anything will  happen to prevent this time--no quarrelling, anyhow. Those two young  creatures have learned their lesson. You'd better take it to heart  too, Nora May. It's less trouble to learn it at second hand. Don't you  ever quarrel with your real beau--it don't matter about the sham ones,  of course. Don't take offence at trifles or listen to what other  people tell you about him--outsiders, that is, that want to make  mischief. What you think about him is of more importance than what  they do. To be sure, you're too young yet to be thinking of such  things at all. But just mind what old Aunt Susanna told you when your  time comes.          Bertie's New Year      He stood on the sagging doorstep and looked out on the snowy world.  His hands were clasped behind him, and his thin face wore a  thoughtful, puzzled look. The door behind him opened jerkingly, and a  scowling woman came out with a pan of dishwater in her hand.    \"Ain't you gone yet, Bert?\" she said sharply. \"What in the world are  you hanging round for?\"    \"It's early yet,\" said Bertie cheerfully. \"I thought maybe George  Fraser'd be along and I'd get a lift as far as the store.\"    \"Well, I never saw such laziness! No wonder old Sampson won't keep you  longer than the holidays if you're no smarter than that. Goodness, if  I don't settle that boy!\"--as the sound of fretful crying came from  the kitchen behind her.    \"What is wrong with William John?\" asked Bertie.    \"Why, he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys, but he  can't. He hasn't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold  again.\"    Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several  times already.    Bertie looked soberly down at his old, well-darned mittens. It was  very cold, and he would have a great many errands to run. He shivered,  and looked up at his aunt's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan  with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William  John. Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out.    \"Here--he can have mine. I'll get on without them well enough.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Ross, but less unkindly. \"The fingers would  freeze off you. Don't be a goose.\"    \"It's all right,\" persisted Bertie. \"I don't need them--much. And  William John doesn't hardly ever get out.\"    He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street, as  though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in  spite of himself. He had to stop a great many times that day to  breathe on his purple hands. Still, he did not regret having lent his  mittens to William John--poor, pale, sickly little William John, who  had so few pleasures.    It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps  of Doctor Forbes's handsome house. His back was turned towards the big  bay window at one side, and he was busy trying to warm his hands, so  he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty  panes.    \"Just look at that poor little boy, Amy,\" said the taller of the two.  \"He is almost frozen, I believe. Why doesn't Caroline hurry and open  the door?\"    \"There she goes now,\" said Amy. \"Edie, couldn't we coax her to let him  come in and get warm? He looks so cold.\" And she drew her sister out  into the hall, where the housekeeper was taking Bertie's parcels.    \"Caroline,\" whispered Edith timidly, \"please tell that poor little  fellow to come in and get warm--he looks very cold.\"    \"He's used to the cold, I warrant you,\" said the housekeeper rather  impatiently. \"It won't hurt him.\"    \"But it is Christmas week,\" said Edith gravely, \"and you know,  Caroline, when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be  particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as  we were at this time.\"    Perhaps Edith's reference to her mother softened Caroline, for she  turned to Bertie and said cordially enough, \"Come in, and warm  yourself before you go. It's a cold day.\"    Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen.    \"Sit up to the fire,\" said Caroline, placing a chair for him, while  Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched  him with friendly interest.    \"What's your name?\" asked Caroline.    \"Robert Ross, ma'am.\"    \"Oh, you're Mrs. Ross's nephew then,\" said Caroline, breaking eggs  into her cake-bowl, and whisking them deftly round. \"And you're  Sampson's errand boy just now? My goodness,\" as the boy spread his  blue hands over the fire, \"where are your mittens, child? You're never  out without mittens a day like this!\"    \"I lent them to William John--he hadn't any,\" faltered Bertie. He did  not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be  mittenless.    \"No mittens!\" exclaimed Amy in dismay. \"Why, I have three pairs. And  who is William John?\"    \"He is my cousin,\" said Bertie. \"And he's awful sickly. He wanted to  go out to play, and he hadn't any mittens, so I lent him mine. I  didn't miss them--much.\"    \"What kind of a Christmas did you have?\"    \"We didn't have any.\"    \"No Christmas!\" said Amy, quite overcome. \"Oh, well, I suppose you are  going to have a good time on New Year's instead.\"    Bertie shook his head.    \"No'm, I guess not. We never have it different from other times.\"    Amy was silent from sheer amazement. Edith understood better, and she  changed the subject.    \"Have you any brothers or sisters, Bertie?\"    \"No'm,\" returned Bertie cheerfully. \"I guess there's enough of us  without that. I must be going now. I'm very much obliged to you.\"    Edith slipped from the room as he spoke, and met him again at the  door. She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens.    \"These are for William John,\" she said simply, \"so that you can have  your own. They are a pair of mine which are too big for me. I know  Papa will say it is all right. Goodbye, Bertie.\"    \"Goodbye--and thank you,\" stammered Bertie, as the door closed. Then  he hastened home to William John.    That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on  Edith's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after  dinner. He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly.    \"What are you musing over?\"    \"There was a little boy here today,\" began Edith.    \"Oh, such a dear little boy,\" broke in Amy eagerly from the corner,  where she was playing with her kitten. \"His name was Bertie Ross. He  brought up the parcels, and we asked him in to get warm. He had no  mittens, and his hands were almost frozen. And, oh, Papa, just  think!--he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all.\"    \"Poor little fellow!\" said the doctor. \"I've heard of him; a pretty  hard time he has of it, I think.\"    \"He was so pretty, Papa. And Edie gave him her blue mittens for  William John.\"    \"The plot deepens. Who is William John?\"    \"Oh, a cousin or something, didn't he say Edie? Anyway, he is sick,  and he wanted to go coasting, and Bertie gave him his mittens. And I  suppose he never had any Christmas either.\"    \"There are plenty who haven't,\" said the doctor, taking up his paper  with a sigh. \"Well, girlies, you seem interested in this little fellow  so, if you like, you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with  you on New Year's night.\"    \"Oh, Papa!\" said Edith, her eyes shining like stars.    The doctor laughed. \"Write him a nice little note of invitation--you  are the lady of the house, you know--and I'll see that he gets it  tomorrow.\"    And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his  first invitation to dine out. He read the little note through three  times in order fully to take in its contents, and then went around the  rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide  some very important question. It was with the same expression that he  opened the door at home in the evening. His aunt was stirring some  oatmeal mush on the stove.    \"Is that you, Bert?\" She spoke sharply. She always spoke sharply, even  when not intending it; it had grown to be a habit.    \"Yes'm,\" said Bertie meekly, as he hung up his cap.    \"I s'pose you've only got one day more at the store,\" said Mrs. Ross.  \"Sampson didn't say anything about keeping you longer, did he?\"    \"No. He said he couldn't--I"]]]
