I ran into the  crowd.    As I reached it I saw Nelson fighting for life. He was surrounded  by a large number who were seeking to murder him; but he had a  loaded whip, the lash wrapped around his hand, using the handle,  which was loaded with several pounds of lead, as a weapon of  defense. He was using it with effect, for he had men piled around  him in all shapes.    As I approached a man sprang to his feet. He had just been  knocked down by Nelson. As the man was rising Nelson gave him a  blow across the loins with the handle of his whip, which had the  effect of straightening out the villain on the grass and rendered  him an inoffensive spectator during the remainder of the play.    Capt. Butler was then a stranger to me, and until I saw him give  the Danite sign of distress I believed him to be one of the  Missouri ruffians who were our enemies. In this contest I came  near committing a serious mistake. I had raised my club to strike  a man, when a Missourian rushed at him and struck him with a  loaded whip, and called him a cursed Mormon. The man then gave  the sign, and I knew how to act.    Capt. Butler was attacked from all sides, but being a powerful  man he used his oak club with effect and knocked a man down at  each blow that he struck, and each man that felt the weight of  his weapon was out of the fight for that day at least. Many of  those that he came in contact with had to be carried from the  field for surgical aid. In the battle, which was spirited, but  short in duration, nine men had their skulls broken, and many  others were seriously injured in other ways. The severe treatment  of the mob by the Danites soon ended the battle.    Three hundred men were present at this difficulty, only thirty of  whom were Mormons, and only eight Mormons took part in the fight.  I was an entire stranger to all who were engaged in the affray,  except Stewart, but I had seen the sign, and, like Samson when  loaning against the pillar, I felt the power of God nerve my arm  for the fray. It helps a man a great deal in a fight to know that  God is on his side.    After the violence had ceased Capt. Butler called the Mormons to  him, and as he stood on a pile of building timber he made a  speech to the brethren. He said that his ancestors had served in  the War of the Revolution to establish a free and independent  government - one in which all men had equal rights and privileges;  that he professed to be half white and free born, and claimed a  right to enjoy his constitutional privileges, and would have his  rights as a citizen, if he had to fight for them; that as to his  religion, it was a matter between his God and himself, and no  man's business; that he would vote, and would die before he would  be driven from the polls.    Several of the Gentile leaders then requested us to lay down our  clubs and go and vote. This Capt. Butler refused, saying:    \"We will not molest anyone who lets us alone, but we will not  risk ourselves again in that crowd without our clubs.\"    The result was the Mormons all voted. It is surprising what a few  resolute men can do when united.    It may be well for purposes of explanation to refer back to the  celebration of the Declaration of Independence on the 4th of  July, 1838, at Far West. That day Joseph Smith made known to the  people the substance of a Revelation he had received from God. It  was to the effect that all the Saints throughout the land were  required to sell their possessions, gather all their money  together, and send an agent to buy up all the land in the region  round about Far West, and get a patent for the land from the  Government, then deed it over to the Church; then every man  should come up there to the land of their promised inheritance  and consecrate what he had to the Lord.    In return the Prophet would set apart a tract of land for each  Saint - the amount to correspond with the number of the Saint's  family - and this land should be for each Saint an everlasting  inheritance. In this way the people could, in time, redeem Zion  (Jackson County) without the shedding of blood. It was also  revealed that unless this was done, in accordance with God's  demand, as required by Him in the Revelation then given to the  people through his Prophet, Joseph Smith, the Saints would be  driven from State to State, from city to city, from one abiding  place to another, until the members would die and waste away,  leaving but a remnant of the Saints to return and receive their  inheritance in Zion (Jackson County) in the last days.    Sidney Rigdon was then the mouthpiece of Joseph Smith, as Aaron  was of Moses in olden times. Rigdon told the Saints that day that  if they did not come up as true Saints and consecrate their  property to the Lord, by laying it down at the feet of the  apostles, they would in a short time be compelled to consecrate  and yield it up to the Gentiles; that if the Saints would be  united as one man, in this consecration of their entire wealth to  the God of Heaven, by giving it up to the control of the  Apostolic Priesthood, then there would be no further danger to  the Saints; they would no more be driven from their homes on  account of their faith and holy works, for the Lord had revealed  to Joseph Smith that He would then fight the battles of His  children, and save them from all their enemies; that the Mormon  people would never be accepted as the children of God unless they  were united as one man, in temporal as well as spiritual affairs,  for Jesus had said unless ye are one, ye are not Mine; that  oneness must exist to make the Saints the accepted children of  God; that if the Saints would yield obedience to the commands of  the Lord all would be well, for the Lord had confirmed these  promises by a Revelation which He had given to Joseph Smith, in  which it was said:    \"I, the Lord, will fight the battles of my people, and if your  enemies shall come up against you, spare them, and if they shall  come up against you again, then shall ye spare them also; oven  unto the third time shall ye spare them; but if they come up  against you the fourth time, I, the Lord, will deliver them into  your hands, to do with them as seemeth good unto you; but if you  then spare them it shall be accounted unto you for righteousness.\"    The words of the apostle, and the promises of God, as then  revealed to me, made a deep impression on my mind, as it did upon  all who heard the same. We that had given up all else for the  sake of the gospel felt willing to do anything on earth that it  was possible to do to obtain the protection of God, and have and  receive His smile of approbation. Those who, like me, had full  faith in the teachings of God, as revealed by Joseph Smith, His  Prophet, were willing to comply with every order, and to obey  every wish of the Priesthood.    The majority of the people, however, felt like Ananias and  Sapphira - they dare not trust all to God and His Prophet. They  felt that their money was as safe in their own possession as it  was when held by the Church authorities. A vote of the people was  had to determine - the question whether they would consecrate  their wealth to the Church, or not. The vote was taken and was  unanimous for the consecration. I soon found out that the people  had voted as I have often known them to do in Mormon meetings  since then; they vote to please the Priesthood, then act to suit  themselves. I never thought that was right or honest; men should  vote their sentiments, but they do not at all times do so. I have  been the victim of such hypocrites.    The vote, as I said, was taken. It was done by a show of hands,  but not a show of hearts. By the readiness with which all hands  went up in favor of consecration it was declared that the people  were of a truth God's children, and, as such, would be protected  by Him. The Prophet and all his Priesthood were jubilant, and  could hardly contain themselves; they were so happy to see the  people such dutiful Saints.    Sidney Rigdon on that day delivered an oration, in which he said  the Mormons were, as a people, loyal to the Government, obedient  to the laws, and as such they were entitled to the protection of  the Government in common with all other denominations, and were  justified in claiming as full protection, in their religious  matters, as the people of any other sect; that the Mormons had  suffered from mob rule and violence, but would no longer submit  to the mob or unjust treatment that had so long followed them.  Now and forevermore would they meet force with force.    \"We have been driven from Kirkland,\" said he; \"from Jackson  County, the true Zion; and now we will maintain our rights,  defend our homes, our wives and children, and our property from  mob rule and violence. If the Saints are again attacked, we will  carry on a war of extermination against our enemies, even to  their homes and firesides, until we despoil those who have  despoiled us, and give no quarter until our enemies are wasted  away. We will unfurl to the breeze the flag of our nation, and  under that banner of freedom we will maintain our rights, or die  in the attempt.\"    At the end of each sentence Rigdon was loudly cheered; and when  he closed his oration I believed the Mormons could successfully  resist the world. But this feeling of confidence faded away as  soon as a second thought entered my mind. I then feared that the  days of liberty for our people had been numbered. First, I feared  the people would not give up all their worldly possessions, to be  disposed of by and at the will and pleasure of three men. In the  second place, I doubted the people being so fully regenerated as  to entitle them to the full and unconditional support and favor  of God that had been promised through the Revelation to Joseph  Smith, in favor of the Latter-day Saints. I knew that God was  able and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#8)"],[1,"on is to ask for a ticket to a  place, and never stop travelling till we get there. We speak German  all right because my parents were Germans, and Jake was born in  Germany; but he don't know much about it because he was only two years  old when he left it eight-and-thirty years ago. We thought we'd like  to see the Paris Exposition, but my! it ain't to be compared to the  Chicago Exhibition, and as for Paris, it can't come up to Noo York,  and these river steamers ain't a patch on the Hudson River boats, and  I don't think much of Europe anyway.\"    Jake, a good-looking, gentle-mannered man, tried to soften the  asperity of his wife's strictures without success. He evidently adored  her.    \"The way we travel,\" resumed Mrs. Jake, \"is to think of a place we've  heard of, and to ask for a ticket to it. Now, we'd heard of Paris and  Cologne, and Heidelberg, and Baden, and Dresden, and Berlin, and  Hamburg, but we don't know now how they come--see? So we hev' to go  cavortin' around to find out which to take next. A gentleman way back  at Cologne\"--she pronounced it \"Klon\"--\"told me Heidelberg came next.  I quite thought Baden was near Hamburg, and that we should take it  last; but they tell me it ain't, and that, you see, has upset all our  calculations. Guess you're a Londoner, anyway; thought so by your  accent!\"    When we left the steamer at Bingen, the last I heard of Mrs. Jake was  a plaintive moan:    \"Guess I don't think much of Europe, anyway, and I wouldn't come  again, not even to cut out Keren-Happuch!\"                   OF SOME FELLOW TRAVELLERS AND THE CATHEDRAL OF MAINZ.      \"Ja Wohl! Frau Rittergutsbesitzer. I have lived in the Herr  Professor's house for five-and-thirty years. I have pickled his  cabbage and preserved his fruit. I have minced with my own hand the  pork for his sausages before they had mincing-machines in  Schleswig-Holstein. I have seen personally to the smoking of his hams  and fish. I make his Apfelkuchen and Nusskuchen myself, and do not buy  them in the shop, like that lazy Hausfrau opposite us at No 2, who  comes from that God-forgotten country England, where all the women are  so badly brought up. I grant you that what I do is no more than the  duty of every God-fearing German _Haushaelterin_; none the less, I do  not mean all my work to go for nothing, and I will not be ousted by a  hussy! In the time of the _vielbedauerten_ mother (Frau Regierungsrat  Lenbach) I had no worries about his matrimonial affairs; she looked  after those. But _sieh mal_, Frau Riedel, now the care of him is on my  shoulders. He has no more idea of taking care of himself than a baby!  He is exactly like that learned man--I think it was our great  Neander--who was running out of his college one day and ran into a  cow; so he pulled off his hat and said, '_Gnaedige Frau, ich bitte um  Verzeihung_' ('Gracious lady, I beg your pardon'), and went on; and  the week after he came tearing round the same corner, thinking, I  suppose, of those heathen gods and goddesses whose pictures shame a  modest woman to look at, and he ran up against a lady, so he cried  out: '_Oh! du dumme Kuh! warum kommst du mir immer in den Weg?_' ('Oh,  you stupid cow, why will you always get in my way?') Yes, my Herr  Professor is just like that--quite as stupid, though they call him so  wise and clever; and what chance has a born innocent like he is  against a designing spinster of forty-five who makes him presents of  _Weihnachtstollen_ at Christmas, _Oster-Eier_ at Easter, and  _Geburtstagstorte_ on his birthday? I ask you what chance of escape a  poor _Junggeselle_ has?    \"Told him she wanted to marry him! Not I. Why, _liebe Frau_, I have  not lived sixty-five and a half years in this world for nothing! If I  let him suppose she was in love with him, that would be the very way  to make him like her. So as I laid the cloth for the Herr Professor's  _Abendtisch_, I remarked casually that Fraeulein Bettine Meyer was not  at all a bad sort of woman really, and that she had some excellent  qualities, if only she did not make herself so ridiculous. 'How  ridiculous?' says he, sitting up. 'What does she do ridiculous, I  should like to know?' 'Why, wears a false front and curls bought at  Frau Koelsch's shop,' says I. 'Poor thing, she can't make herself look  young and beautiful, whatever she does, and Frau Rittmeister Bernstorf  was laughing at her the other day, and at the high heels and at the  stuffing the _Schneiderin_ round the corner puts into her gowns to  cover the angular bones! She would look much more respectable,' said  I, 'if she would brush her scanty grey locks back, and smooth them  with pomatum as I do, and wear a black lace _Muetze_ over them, instead  of making herself the laughing-stock of Schleswig.' And away I walked.  And the Professor ate no supper that night, and next day he left for  his _Ferienausflug_, and never called to say good-bye to Fraeulein  Meyer; and so I put the extinguisher on that little candle just as its  flame was beginning to burn up, and--why! here we are at Mainz.\"    And this is what I heard, and how I was entertained, in the  \"elektrische Bahn\" on my little expedition from Wiesbaden to Mainz. I  reflected, as I saw the Haushaelterin get down heavily with all the  deliberation of her sixty-five and a half years, that feline amenities  are much the same in Germany as in England; and I felt sorry for poor  Fraeulein Meyer, who might have given up her small vanities and made  pancakes and _Apfelkuchen_ for the Professor quite as well in the end  as the Haushaelterin.    The cathedral of Mainz was, of course, the object of our expedition.  It dominates the city from afar, with its wonderful towers and  pinnacles, making of Mainz (a commonplace city enough) a thing of  beauty. From the shores of the Rhine we crossed a wide street planted  with trees and lined on each hand with modern German houses of pinkish  stone (covered with heavy sculpture and breaking out into countless  balconies and bay windows), and soon found ourselves in the  market-place. And here, indeed, one felt oneself in the Germany of  bygone days. Instead of pseudo-classic buildings, heavy with  meaningless ornamentation, we found beautiful old timber-framed  houses, with deep eaves and wood carvings. On one of these I read:                              Zum Kurfuerstlichen                                  Wappen.                             Erneuert in Jahr                                 des Heils                                   1899.    It was evidently a Gasthaus of considerable antiquity, and had been  carefully restored. Close by a Brobdingnagian finger lured the unwary  to where it pointed--a low doorway above which was inscribed the  legend: \"_Hier essen Sie gut_.\" The market-place had been dismantled  of its stalls and umbrellas all but one, which was being furled as we  arrived on the scene. A couple of men in blue smocks were sweeping up  the cabbage leaves, straw and refuse, market carts were driving off,  and smart-looking officers in beautiful uniforms strolled across what  we English miscall \"a square\" for want of a better word.    But to get a good view of the exterior of the cathedral was what we  wanted, and to this end we dived down strange, evil-smelling alleys,  and went round and round a labyrinth of streets, always expecting to  see, and never arriving at, the cathedral's facade. At last we  realised that the quest was hopeless, since the building is so  surrounded and deformed by commonplace, ugly houses that nothing of it  but roof and towers can be seen from outside. We entered it at last by  a narrow lane between poor, ugly houses, an unfit approach indeed to  this beautiful Romanesque cathedral--one of the four famous Romanesque  Gothic cathedrals of Germany. The general effect of the interior is  that of strength, solidity, and simplicity. The grand structural lines  are noble and pure. There is an entire absence of the florid in  architecture, and no attempt at all at decoration as one understands  it in Spanish cathedrals. The tone of the walls and floor is a pinkish  brown, and the whole church has a warm glowing effect from its  richly-coloured stone. I could have spared most, if not all, of the  overladen rococo monuments to the Electors of Mainz, with their  monstrous records of impossible perfections; but my companion (a  German lady) thought them beautiful. The whole church struck one as  rather ill-kept; perhaps the red stone floor had something to do with  it. Dust and mud do not adhere somehow to an opus Alexandrinum  pavement. A guide appeared to offer his services, almost obsequiously  polite in his attentions to the English lady. Whatever their opinions  may be as to our failings and vices, our shortcomings and our  iniquities, most Germans are civil to us nowadays.[3] They hate us  cordially, envy us sincerely, attack us in the press and out of it,  and are insanely jealous of the people they affect to despise. But  while the superficial _entente_ lasts, they smile and bow and are  outwardly polite. I asked an English lady, the widow of a German  official, if her husband, having married an English wife, did not  cherish kindlier sentiments towards us than the majority of his  countrymen. \"He died during the Boer war,\" she said, \"and he died in  the sure and certain hope that England was done for.\"        [Footnote 3: This was written before the war.]    Apart from the Domkirche, there is little to see in Mainz, although  the city is of great antiquity, having been founded by Drusus. It is a  strongly fortified place, and stood once upon a time a memorable  siege. There are pleasant walks by the Rhine, beautiful Anlagen, a  picturesque old tower, and the site of Gutenberg's house to see. The  Grand Ducal Palace once sheltered Napoleon the First, as did many  another palace in Germany. The present Grand Duke prefers his palace  in Darmstadt, the Neue Palais (built by"]]]
