Make it simmer on a low fire so that the gravy remains,  and serve in its gravy, squeezing over some lemon juice when sent to the  table.    In this and in similar cases, when using scallions or onions, some  advise putting these in a cloth after being chopped and dip them in cold  water squeezing them dry after.      84    MUTTON CUTLETS AND FILET OF VEAL    (Braciuole di castrato e filetto di vitella)    Put in saucepan a slice of ham, some butter, a little bunch composed of  carrot, celery and stems of parsley and over this some whole cutlets of  mutton seasoned with salt and pepper. Make them brown on both sides, add  another piece of butter, if necessary, and add to the cutlets some  chicken giblets, sweetbreads and fresh or dry mushrooms (the latter  softened in water), all cut in pieces. When all this begins to brown,  pour some soup stock and let it simmer on a low fire. Sprinkle a little  flour and finally pour a wineglass (or half a tumbler) of white wine  leaving it boil a little more. When ready to serve remove the ham and  the greens, rub the gravy through a sieve and remove the superfluous  fat.      85    TENDERLOIN WITH MARSALA    (Filetto al marsala)    Roll a piece of the tenderloin, tie it and, if it is about two pounds,  put it on the fire with a middle-sized onion cut in thin slices, some  thin slices of ham and a piece of butter, seasoning but moderately with  salt and pepper. When it is browned from all sides and the onion is  consumed, sprinkle a pinch of flour, let this take color and then pour  some soup stock or water. Make it simmer on a low fire, then rub the  gravy through a sieve, skim off the fat and with this and half a small  tumbler of Marsala or Sherry wine put it back on the fire to simmer  again. Serve with the gravy neither too liquid nor too thick.    The filet can also be larded with bacon and cooked in butter and Marsala  only.      86    MEAT GENOVESE    (Carne alla Genovese)    Take thick slices of good lean veal, weighing about a pound, beat it and  flatten it well. Beat three or four eggs, season them with salt and  pepper, a pinch of grated cheese and some chopped parsley. Fry the eggs  in butter in the form of an omelet about the size of the meat over  which it will be laid, cutting it where it overlaps and putting the  pieces where it lacks so as to cover the meat entirely. After that roll  tight the meat together with the omelet and tie it with thread. Then  sprinkle some flour over it and put it in a saucepan with a piece of  butter, seasoning with salt and pepper. When it is well browned on all  sides, pour some soup stock to complete the cooking and serve it in its  gravy which will be thick enough on account of the flour.      87    RICE PUDDING WITH GIBLETS    (Sfornato di riso con rigoglie)    Make a good brown stock (see No. 13) and use the same for the rice as  well as for the giblets. To these add some thin slices of ham and brown  them first in butter, seasoned moderately with salt and pepper,  completing the cooking with brown stock. A taste of mushrooms will be  found useful.    Brown the rice equally in butter, then complete the cooking with hot  water. Drain and put the brown stock, adding grated cheese and two  beaten eggs, when the rice has cooled a little.    Take a smooth mold, round or oval, grease it evenly with butter, cover  the bottom with buttered paper and place in it the rice to harden it in  the oven. When taken from the mold pour over the gravy from the  giblets, slightly thickened with a pinch of flour and serve with the  giblets around, seeing that there is plenty of gravy for them.      88    PUDDING GENOESE    (Budino alla genovese)    Chop together a slice of veal, some chicken breast and two slices of ham  and then grind or better pound them, with a small piece of butter, a  tablespoonful of grated cheese and a crumb of bread soaked with milk.  Rub through a sieve and add three tablespoonfuls of =Balsamella= (see  No. 54) which you will make thick enough for this dish, three eggs and  just a taste of nutmeg, mixing everything well.    Take a smooth mold, grease it evenly with butter and put on the bottom a  sheet of paper, cut according to the shape of the bottom and equally  greased with butter. Pour over the above ingredients and cook in a  vessel immersed in boiling water (double boiler).    When taken from the mold, remove the paper and in its place put a gravy  formed with chopped chicken giblets cooked in brown stock. Serve hot.      89    LIVER LOAF    (Pane di fegato)    Cut about one pound of veal liver in thin slices and four chicken livers  in two parts and put all this in a saucepan with rosemary and a piece of  butter. When this is melted put in another piece and season with salt  and pepper. After four or five minutes at a live fire, remove the liver  (dry) and grind it together with the rosemary. In the gravy that remains  in the saucepan put a big crumb of bread, cut into small pieces and make  a paste that will also be ground with the liver. Then rub everything  through a sieve, add one whole egg and two yolks and a pinch of grated  cheese, diluting with brown stock or water. Finally put in a smooth mold  with a sheet of paper in the bottom, all evenly greased with butter and  cook in a double boiler. Remove from the mold when cool and serve cold,  with gelatine.      90    VEAL WITH TUNNY    (Vitello tonnato)    Take two pounds of meat without bones, remove the fat and tendons, then  lard it with two anchovies. These must be washed and boned and cut  lengthwise, after opening them, making in all eight pieces. Tie the  piece of meat not very tight and boil it for an hour and a half in  enough water to cover it completely. Previously put into the water one  quarter of an onion larded with clover, one leaf of laurel, celery,  carrot and parsley. Salt the water generously and don't put the veal in  until it is boiling. When the veal is cooked, untie, dry it and keep it  for two or three days in the following sauce in quantity sufficient to  cover it.    Grind 1/4 pound tunny fish preserved in olive oil and two anchovies,  crush them well with the blade of a knife and rub through a sieve adding  good olive oil in abundance little by little, and squeeze in one whole  lemon, so that the sauce should remain liquid. Finally mix in some  capers soaked in vinegar.    Serve the veal cold, in thin slices, with the sauce.    The stock of the veal can be rubbed through a sieve and used for  risotto.      91    STUFFED ITALIAN SQUASH    (Zucchini ripieni)    For a description of the =Zucchini= see No. 32.    To make the stuffed zucchini first cut them lengthwise in two halves and  remove the interior pulp, leaving space enough for the filling.    Take some lean veal (quantity in proportion to the squashes) cut it into  pieces and place it on the fire in a saucepan with a hash of onion,  parsley, celery, carrot, a little corned beef cut in little pieces, a  little oil, salt and pepper. Stir it often with a spoon and when the  meat is brown pour in a cup of water and then another after a while.  Then rub the gravy through a sieve and put it aside.    Chop the cooked meat fine and grind it in the grinder and make a hash of  it and one egg, a little grated cheese, a crumb of bread boiled in milk  or in soup stock and just a taste of nutmeg. Put this hash inside each  half squash and put them to brown in butter, completing the cooking with  the gravy set aside.      92    STRING BEANS AND SQUASHES SAUTE    (Fagiolini e zucchini saute)    Brown in butter some string beans, that have been previously half cooked  in water and some raw squashes cut in cubes. Put the squashes in only  when the butter is beginning to brown. Season moderately with salt and  butter and add some brown stock or good tomato sauce.      93    STRING BEANS WITH EGG SAUCE    (Fagiuolini in salsa d'uovo)    Take less than a pound of string beans, cutting off the two points and  removing all the strings, and then cook them partially in water  moderately salted. Take them from the kettle, drain, and brown with  butter, salt and pepper. Beat one yolk with a teaspoonful of flour and  the juice of half a small lemon, dilute with half a cup of cold broth  from which the fat has been removed and put this liquid on the fire in a  small saucepan stirring continually. When the liquid has become, through  the cooking, like a cream, pour it on the string beans that you will  keep on the fire a little longer, with the sauce. The string beans so  prepared can be served with boiled beef.      94    STRING BEANS IN MOLD    (Sformato di fagiolini)    Take one pound of string beans, seeing that they are quite tender. Cut  off the ends and remove the strings. Throw them into boiling water with  a pinch of salt and when they are half cooked take them away and put  them in cold water. If you have brown stock complete the cooking with  this and with butter, otherwise brown a piece of onion, some parsley, a  piece of celery and olive oil. When the onion is browned put in the  string beans and complete the cooking with a little water if necessary.    Prepare a =Balsamella= sauce (No. 54) with a small piece of butter,  half a teaspoonful of flour and half a cup of milk. With this, a  tablespoonful of grated cheese and four beaten eggs bind the string  beans when they are cold, mix and put in a mold, evenly greased with  butter and the bottom covered with paper. Cook in a double boiler and  serve hot.      95    CAULIFLOWER IN MOLD    (Sformato di cavolfiore)    Take a good sized cauliflower, remove the stalk and outside leaves, half  cook it in water and then cut it into small pieces. Salt them and put  them to brown with a little piece of butter and then complete the  cooking with a cup of milk. Then rub them through a sieve. Prepare a  =Balsamella= (No. 54) and add it to the cauliflower with 3 beaten eggs  and a tablespoonful of grated cheese.

From Dr.  Edward Assmuss' little work on the \"Parasites of the Honey Bee,\" we  glean some of the facts now presented, and which cannot fail to interest  the general reader as well as the owner of bees.    The study of the habits of animal parasites has of late gained much  attention among naturalists, and both the honey and wild bees afford  good examples of the singular relation between the host and the  parasites which live upon it. Among insects generally, there are certain  species which devour the contents of the egg of the victim. Others, and  this is the most common mode of parasitism, attack the insect in its  larva state; others, in the pupa state, and still others in the perfect,  or imago state. Dr. Leidy has shown that the wood-devouring species of  beetle, Passalus cornutus, and some Myriopods, or \"thousand legs,\" are,  in some cases, tenanted by myriads of microscopic plants and worms which  luxuriate in the alimentary canal, while the \"caterpillar-fungus\"  attacks sickly caterpillars, filling out their bodies, and sending out  shoots into the air, so that the insect looks as if transformed into a  vegetable.    The Ichneumon flies, of which there are undoubtedly several thousand  species in this country, are the most common insect parasites. Next to  these are the different species of Tachina and its allied genera. These,  like Ichneumons, live in the bodies of their hosts, consuming the fatty  parts, and finishing their transformations just as the exhausted host  is ready to die, issue from their bodies as flies, closely resembling  the common housefly.    A small fly has been found in Europe to be the most formidable foe of  the hive bee, sometimes producing the well-known disease called  \"foul-brood,\" which is analogous to the typhus fever of man.    [Illustration: 32. Phora and its Young.]    This fly, belonging to the genus Phora (Fig. 32, Phora incrassata; _a_,  larva; _b_, puparium; _c_, another species from Mammoth Cave), is a  small insect about a line and a half long, and found in Europe during  the summer and autumn flying slowly about flowers and windows, and in  the vicinity of beehives. Its white, transparent larva is cylindrical, a  little pointed before, but broader behind. The head is small and  rounded, with short, three-jointed antennae, and at the posterior end of  the body are several slender spines. The puparium, or pupa case,  inclosing the delicate chrysalis, is oval, consisting of eight segments,  flattened above, with two large spines near the head, and four on the  extremity of the body.    When impelled by instinct to provide for the continuance of its species,  the Phora enters the beehive and gains admission to a cell, when it  bores with its ovipositor through the skin of the bee larva, laying its  long oval egg in a horizontal position just under the skin. The embryo  of the Phora is already well developed, so that in three hours after the  egg is inserted in the body of its unsuspecting and helpless host, the  embryo is nearly ready to hatch. In about two hours more it actually  breaks off the larger end of the egg-shell and at once begins to eat the  fatty tissues of its victim, its posterior half still remaining in the  shell. In an hour more, it leaves the egg entirely and buries itself  completely in the fatty portion of the young bee.    The maggot moults three times. In twelve hours after the last moult it  turns around with its head towards the posterior end of the body of its  host, and in another twelve hours, having become full-fed, it bores  through the skin of the young, eats its way through the brood-covering  of the cell and falls to the bottom of the hive, where it changes to a  pupa in the dust and dirt, or else creeps out of the door and transforms  in the earth. Twelve days after, the fly appears.    The young bee, emaciated and enfeebled by the attacks of its ravenous  parasite, dies, and its decaying body fills the bottom of the cell with  a slimy, foul-smelling mass, called \"foul-brood.\" This gives rise to a  miasma which poisons the neighboring brood, until the contagion (for the  disease is analogous to typhus, jail or ship-fever) spreads through the  whole hive, unless promptly checked by removing the cause and thoroughly  cleansing the hive.    Foul-brood sometimes attacks our American hives, and, though the cause  may not be known, yet from the hints given above we hope to have the  history of our species of Phora cleared up, should our disease be found  to be sometimes due to the attacks of such a parasitic fly.    [Illustration: 33. Bee Louse and Larva.]    We figure the Bee louse of Europe (Fig. 33 b, Braula caeca), which is a  singular wingless spider-like fly, allied to the wingless Sheep tick  (Melophagus), the wingless Bat tick (Nycteribia) and the winged Horse  fly (Hippobosca). The head is very large, without eyes or ocelli (simple  eyes), while the ovate hind-body consists of five segments, and is  covered with stiff hairs. It is one-half to two-thirds of a line long.  This spider fly is \"pupiparous,\" that is, the young, of which only a  very few are produced, is not born until it has assumed the pupa state  or is just about to do so. The larva (Fig. 33 _a_) is oval,  eleven-jointed, and white in color. The very day it is hatched, it sheds  its skin and changes to an oval puparium of a dark brown color.    Its habits resemble those of the flea. Indeed, should we compress its  body strongly, it would bear a striking resemblance to that insect. It  is evidently a connecting link between the flea, and the two winged  flies. Like the former it lives on the body of its host, and obtains its  food by plunging its stout beak into the bee and sucking its blood.    It has not been noticed in this country, but is liable to be imported on  the bodies of Italian bees. Generally, one or two of the Braulas may, on  close examination, be detected on the body of the bee; sometimes the  poor bees are loaded down by as many as a hundred of these hungry  blood-suckers. Assmuss recommends rubbing them off with a feather, as  the bee goes in and out of the door of its hive.    [Illustration: 34. Hive Trichodes.]    Among the beetles are a few forms occasionally found in bees' nests and  also parasitic on the body of the bee. Trichodes apiarius (Fig. 34, _a_,  larva; _b_, pupa, front view) has long been known in Europe to attack  the young bees. In its perfect, or beetle state it is found on flowers,  like our Trichodes Nuttallii, which is commonly found on the Spiraea in  August, and which may yet prove to enter our beehives. The larva devours  the brood, but with the modern hive its ravages may be readily detected.    [Illustration: 35. Meloe.]    The Oil beetle, Meloe angusticollis (Fig. 35, male, differing from the  female by having the antennae as if twisted into a knot; Fig. 36, the  active larva found on the body of the bee), is a large dark blue insect  found crawling in the grass in the vicinity of the nests of Andrena,  Halictus, and other wild bees in May, and again in August and  September. The eggs are laid in a mass covered with earth at the root  of some plant. During April and early in May, when the willows are in  blossom, we have found the young recently hatched larvae in considerable  abundance creeping briskly over the bees, or with their heads plunged  between the segments of the body, greedily sucking in the juices of  their host. Those that we saw occurred on the Humble and other wild  bees, and on various flies (Syrphus and Muscidae), and there is no reason  why they should not infest the Honey bee, which frequents similar  flowers, as they are actually known to do in Europe. These larvae are  probably hatched out near where the bees hibernate, so as to creep into  their bodies before they fly in the spring, as it would be impossible  for them to crawl up a willow tree ten feet high or more, their feet  being solely adapted for climbing over the hairy body of the bee, which  they do not leave until about to undergo their strange and unusual  transformations.    [Illustration: Early Stages of Meloe.]    In Europe, Assmuss states that on being brought into the nest by the  bee, they leave the bee and devour the eggs in the bee cells, and then  attack the bee bread. When full-fed and ready to pass through their  transformations to attain the beetle state, instead of at once assuming  the pupa and imago forms, as in the Trichodes represented in fig. 34,  they pass through a _hyper-metamorphosis_, as Fabre, a French  naturalist, calls it. In other words, the changes in form which are  preparatory to assuming the pupa and imago states are more marked and  almost coequal with the larva and pupa states, so that the Meloe,  instead of passing through three states (the egg, larva and pupa), in  realty passes through these and two others in addition, which are  intermediate. The whole subject of the metamorphosis of this beetle  needs revision, but Fabre states that the larva, soon after entering the  nest of its host, changes its skin and assumes a second larva form.  Newport, who with Siebold has carefully described the metamorphoses of  Meloe, does not mention this stage in its development, which Fabre calls  \"pseudo-chrysalis.\" It is motionless, the head is mask-like, without  movable appendages, and the feet are represented by six tubercles. This  is more properly speaking the semi-pupa, and the mature pupa grows  beneath its mask-like form, which is finally moulted. This form,  however, according to Fabre, changes its skin and turns into a third  larva form (Fig. 37). After some time it assumes its true pupa form  (Fig. 38), and finally moults this skin to appear as a beetle.    Fabre has also, in a lively and well-written account, given a history of  Sitaris, a European beetle, somewhat resembling Meloe. He states that  Sitaris lays its eggs near the"]]]
