When he had fully mastered this knowledge, Odin cut magic runes upon  his spear Gungnir, upon the teeth of his horse Sleipnir, upon the  claws of the bear, and upon countless other animate and inanimate  things. And because he had thus hung over the abyss for such a long  space of time, he was ever after considered the patron divinity of  all who were condemned to be hanged or who perished by the noose.    After obtaining the gift of wisdom and runes, which gave him power over  all things, Odin also coveted the gift of eloquence and poetry, which  he acquired in a manner which we shall relate in a subsequent chapter.        Geirrod and Agnar    Odin, as has already been stated, took great interest in the affairs  of mortals, and, we are told, was specially fond of watching King  Hrauding's handsome little sons, Geirrod and Agnar, when they were  about eight and ten years of age respectively. One day these little  lads went fishing, and a storm suddenly arose which blew their boat  far out to sea, where it finally stranded upon an island, upon which  dwelt a seeming old couple, who in reality were Odin and Frigga in  disguise. They had assumed these forms in order to indulge a sudden  passion for the close society of their proteges. The lads were warmly  welcomed and kindly treated, Odin choosing Geirrod as his favourite,  and teaching him the use of arms, while Frigga petted and made much  of little Agnar. The boys tarried on the island with their kind  protectors during the long, cold winter season; but when spring came,  and the skies were blue, and the sea calm, they embarked in a boat  which Odin provided, and set out for their native shore. Favoured by  gentle breezes, they were soon wafted thither; but as the boat neared  the strand Geirrod quickly sprang out and pushed it far back into the  water, bidding his brother sail away into the evil spirit's power. At  that self-same moment the wind veered, and Agnar was indeed carried  away, while his brother hastened to his father's palace with a lying  tale as to what had happened to his brother. He was joyfully received  as one from the dead, and in due time he succeeded his father upon  the throne.    Years passed by, during which the attention of Odin had been claimed by  other high considerations, when one day, while the divine couple were  seated on the throne Hlidskialf, Odin suddenly remembered the winter's  sojourn on the desert island, and he bade his wife notice how powerful  his pupil had become, and taunted her because her favourite Agnar had  married a giantess and had remained poor and of no consequence. Frigga  quietly replied that it was better to be poor than hardhearted,  and accused Geirrod of lack of hospitality--one of the most heinous  crimes in the eyes of a Northman. She even went so far as to declare  that in spite of all his wealth he often ill-treated his guests.    When Odin heard this accusation he declared that he would prove the  falsity of the charge by assuming the guise of a Wanderer and testing  Geirrod's generosity. Wrapped in his cloud-hued raiment, with slouch  hat and pilgrim staff,--          \"Wanderer calls me the world,      Far have I carried my feet,      On the back of the earth      I have boundlessly been,\"--                Wagner (Forman's tr.).      Odin immediately set out by a roundabout way, while Frigga, to outwit  him, immediately despatched a swift messenger to warn Geirrod to  beware of a man in wide mantle and broad-brimmed hat, as he was a  wicked enchanter who would work him ill.    When, therefore, Odin presented himself before the king's palace  he was dragged into Geirrod's presence and questioned roughly. He  gave his name as Grimnir, but refused to tell whence he came or what  he wanted, so as this reticence confirmed the suspicion suggested  to the mind of Geirrod, he allowed his love of cruelty full play,  and commanded that the stranger should be bound between two fires,  in such wise that the flames played around him without quite touching  him, and he remained thus eight days and nights, in obstinate silence,  without food. Now Agnar had returned secretly to his brother's palace,  where he occupied a menial position, and one night when all was still,  in pity for the suffering of the unfortunate captive, he conveyed to  his lips a horn of ale. But for this Odin would have had nothing to  drink--the most serious of all trials to the god.    At the end of the eighth day, while Geirrod, seated upon his throne,  was gloating over his prisoner's sufferings, Odin began to sing--softly  at first, then louder and louder, until the hall re-echoed with his  triumphant notes--a prophecy that the king, who had so long enjoyed  the god's favour, would soon perish by his own sword.          \"The fallen by the sword      Ygg shall now have;      Thy life is now run out:      Wroth with thee are the Disir:      Odin thou now shalt see:      Draw near to me if thou canst.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).      As the last notes died away the chains dropped from his hands, the  flames flickered and went out, and Odin stood in the midst of the hall,  no longer in human form, but in all the power and beauty of a god.    On hearing the ominous prophecy Geirrod hastily drew his sword,  intending to slay the insolent singer; but when he beheld the sudden  transformation he started in dismay, tripped, fell upon the sharp  blade, and perished as Odin had just foretold. Turning to Agnar, who,  according to some accounts, was the king's son, and not his brother,  for these old stories are often strangely confused, Odin bade him  ascend the throne in reward for his humanity, and, further to repay  him for the timely draught of ale, he promised to bless him with all  manner of prosperity.    On another occasion Odin wandered to earth, and was absent so  long that the gods began to think that they would not see him in  Asgard again. This encouraged his brothers Vili and Ve, who by some  mythologists are considered as other personifications of himself,  to usurp his power and his throne, and even, we are told, to espouse  his wife Frigga.          \"Be thou silent, Frigg!      Thou art Fioergyn's daughter      And ever hast been fond of men,      Since Ve and Vili, it is said,      Thou, Vidrir's wife, didst      Both to thy bosom take.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).        May-Day Festivals    But upon Odin's return the usurpers vanished for ever; and in  commemoration of the disappearance of the false Odin, who had ruled  seven months and had brought nothing but unhappiness to the world,  and of the return of the benevolent deity, the heathen Northmen  formerly celebrated yearly festivals, which were long continued  as May Day rejoicings. Until very lately there was always, on that  day, a grand procession in Sweden, known as the May Ride, in which a  flower-decked May king (Odin) pelted with blossoms the fur-enveloped  Winter (his supplanter), until he put him to ignominious flight. In  England also the first of May was celebrated as a festive occasion,  in which May-pole dances, May queens, Maid Marian, and Jack in the  Green played prominent parts.    As personification of heaven, Odin, of course, was the lover and spouse  of the earth, and as to them the earth bore a threefold aspect, the  Northmen depicted him as a polygamist, and allotted to him several  wives. The first among these was Joerd (Erda), the primitive earth,  daughter of Night or of the giantess Fiorgyn. She bore him his  famous son Thor, the god of thunder. The second and principal wife  was Frigga, a personification of the civilised world. She gave him  Balder, the gentle god of spring, Hermod, and, according to some  authorities, Tyr. The third wife was Rinda, a personification of the  hard and frozen earth, who reluctantly yields to his warm embrace,  but finally gives birth to Vali, the emblem of vegetation.    Odin is also said to have married Saga or Laga, the goddess of history  (hence our verb \"to say\"), and to have daily visited her in the crystal  hall of Sokvabek, beneath a cool, ever-flowing river, to drink its  waters and listen to her songs about olden times and vanished races.          \"Sokvabek hight the fourth dwelling;      Over it flow the cool billows;      Glad drink there Odin and Saga      Every day from golden cups.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      His other wives were Grid, the mother of Vidar; Gunlod, the mother  of Bragi; Skadi; and the nine giantesses who simultaneously bore  Heimdall--all of whom play more or less important parts in the various  myths of the North.        The Historical Odin    Besides this ancient Odin, there was a more modern, semi-historical  personage of the same name, to whom all the virtues, powers, and  adventures of his predecessor have been attributed. He was the  chief of the AEsir, inhabitants of Asia Minor, who, sore pressed by  the Romans, and threatened with destruction or slavery, left their  native land about 70 B.C., and migrated into Europe. This Odin is  said to have conquered Russia, Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,  leaving a son on the throne of each conquered country. He also built  the town of Odensoe. He was welcomed in Sweden by Gylfi, the king,  who gave him a share of the realm, and allowed him to found the city  of Sigtuna, where he built a temple and introduced a new system of  worship. Tradition further relates that as his end drew near, this  mythical Odin assembled his followers, publicly cut himself nine  times in the breast with his spear,--a ceremony called \"carving Geir  odds,\"--and told them he was about to return to his native land Asgard,  his old home, where he would await their coming, to share with him  a life of feasting, drinking, and fighting.    According to another account, Gylfi, having heard of the power  of the AEsir, the inhabitants of Asgard, and wishing to ascertain  whether"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#8)"],[1,"of ten thousand armed footmen, and fifteen hundred horsemen.  He also built walls about proper places; Alexandrium, and Hyrcanium, and  Machaerus, that lay upon the mountains of Arabia.    3. However, Gabinius sent before him Marcus Antonius, and followed  himself with his whole army; but for the select body of soldiers that  were about Antipater, and another body of Jews under the command of  Malichus and Pitholaus, these joined themselves to those captains  that were about Marcus Antonius, and met Alexander; to which body came  Gabinius with his main army soon afterward; and as Alexander was not  able to sustain the charge of the enemies' forces, now they were joined,  he retired. But when he was come near to Jerusalem, he was forced to  fight, and lost six thousand men in the battle; three thousand of which  fell down dead, and three thousand were taken alive; so he fled with the  remainder to Alexandrium.    4. Now when Gabinius was come to Alexandrium, because he found a great  many there en-camped, he tried, by promising them pardon for their  former offenses, to induce them to come over to him before it came to a  fight; but when they would hearken to no terms of accommodation, he  slew a great number of them, and shut up a great number of them in the  citadel. Now Marcus Antonius, their leader, signalized himself in this  battle, who, as he always showed great courage, so did he never show it  so much as now; but Gabinius, leaving forces to take the citadel, went  away himself, and settled the cities that had not been demolished,  and rebuilt those that had been destroyed. Accordingly, upon his  injunctions, the following cities were restored: Scythopolis, and  Samaria, and Anthedon, and Apollonia, and Jamnia, and Raphia, and  Mariassa, and Adoreus, and Gamala, and Ashdod, and many others; while  a great number of men readily ran to each of them, and became their  inhabitants.    5. When Gabinius had taken care of these cities, he returned to  Alexandrium, and pressed on the siege. So when Alexander despaired of  ever obtaining the government, he sent ambassadors to him, and prayed  him to forgive what he had offended him in, and gave up to him the  remaining fortresses, Hyrcanium and Machaerus, as he put Alexandrium  into his hands afterwards; all which Gabinius demolished, at the  persuasion of Alexander's mother, that they might not be receptacles of  men in a second war. She was now there in order to mollify Gabinius, out  of her concern for her relations that were captives at Rome, which were  her husband and her other children. After this Gabinius brought Hyrcanus  to Jerusalem, and committed the care of the temple to him; but ordained  the other political government to be by an aristocracy. He also parted  the whole nation into five conventions, assigning one portion to  Jerusalem, another to Gadara, that another should belong to Amathus, a  fourth to Jericho, and to the fifth division was allotted Sepphoris,  a city of Galilee. So the people were glad to be thus freed from  monarchical government, and were governed for the future by all  aristocracy.    6. Yet did Aristobulus afford another foundation for new disturbances.  He fled away from Rome, and got together again many of the Jews that  were desirous of a change, such as had borne an affection to him of old;  and when he had taken Alexandrium in the first place, he attempted to  build a wall about it; but as soon as Gabinius had sent an army against  him under Siscuria, and Antonius, and Servilius, he was aware of it,  and retreated to Machaerus. And as for the unprofitable multitude, he  dismissed them, and only marched on with those that were armed, being to  the number of eight thousand, among whom was Pitholaus, who had been the  lieutenant at Jerusalem, but deserted to Aristobulus with a thousand  of his men; so the Romans followed him, and when it came to a battle,  Aristobulus's party for a long time fought courageously; but at length  they were overborne by the Romans, and of them five thousand fell down  dead, and about two thousand fled to a certain little hill, but the  thousand that remained with Aristobulus brake through the Roman army,  and marched together to Machaerus; and when the king had lodged the  first night upon its ruins, he was in hopes of raising another army, if  the war would but cease a while; accordingly, he fortified that strong  hold, though it was done after a poor manner. But the Romans falling  upon him, he resisted, even beyond his abilities, for two days, and then  was taken, and brought a prisoner to Gabinius, with Antigonus his son,  who had fled away together with him from Rome; and from Gabinius he was  carried to Rome again. Wherefore the senate put him under confinement,  but returned his children back to Judea, because Gabinius informed them  by letters that he had promised Aristobulus's mother to do so, for her  delivering the fortresses up to him.    7. But now as Gabinius was marching to the war against the Parthians,  he was hindered by Ptolemy, whom, upon his return from Euphrates, he  brought back into Egypt, making use of Hyrcanus and Antipater to provide  every thing that was necessary for this expedition; for Antipater  furnished him with money, and weapons, and corn, and auxiliaries; he  also prevailed with the Jews that were there, and guarded the avenues at  Pelusium, to let them pass. But now, upon Gabinius's absence, the other  part of Syria was in motion, and Alexander, the son of Aristobulus,  brought the Jews to revolt again. Accordingly, he got together a very  great army, and set about killing all the Romans that were in the  country; hereupon Gabinius was afraid, [for he was come back already out  of Egypt, and obliged to come back quickly by these tumults,] and  sent Antipater, who prevailed with some of the revolters to be quiet.  However, thirty thousand still continued with Alexander, who was himself  eager to fight also; accordingly, Gabinius went out to fight, when  the Jews met him; and as the battle was fought near Mount Tabor, ten  thousand of them were slain, and the rest of the multitude dispersed  themselves, and fled away. So Gabinius came to Jerusalem, and settled  the government as Antipater would have it; thence he marched, and fought  and beat the Nabateans: as for Mithridates and Orsanes, who fled out of  Parthin, he sent them away privately, but gave it out among the soldiers  that they had run away.    8. In the mean time, Crassus came as successor to Gabinius in Syria. He  took away all the rest of the gold belonging to the temple of Jerusalem,  in order to furnish himself for his expedition against the Parthians.  He also took away the two thousand talents which Pompey had not touched;  but when he had passed over Euphrates, he perished himself, and his army  with him; concerning which affairs this is not a proper time to speak  [more largely].    9. But now Cassius, after Crassus, put a stop to the Parthians, who were  marching in order to enter Syria. Cassius had fled into that province,  and when he had taken possession of the same, he made a hasty march into  Judea; and, upon his taking Taricheae, he carried thirty thousand Jews  into slavery. He also slew Pitholaus, who had supported the seditious  followers of Aristobulus; and it was Antipater who advised him so to  do. Now this Antipater married a wife of an eminent family among the  Arabisus, whose name was Cypros, and had four sons born to him by her,  Phasaelus and Herod, who was afterwards king, and, besides these, Joseph  and Pheroras; and he had a daughter whose name was Salome. Now as he  made himself friends among the men of power every where, by the kind  offices he did them, and the hospitable manner that he treated them;  so did he contract the greatest friendship with the king of Arabia, by  marrying his relation; insomuch that when he made war with Aristobulus,  he sent and intrusted his children with him. So when Cassius had forced  Alexander to come to terms and to be quiet, he returned to Euphrates,  in order to prevent the Parthians from repassing it; concerning which  matter we shall speak elsewhere. 11              CHAPTER 9.           Aristobulus Is Taken Off By Pompey's Friends, As Is His Son       Alexander By Scipio. Antipater Cultivates A Friendship With       Caesar, After Pompey's Death; He Also Performs Great Actions       In That War, Wherein He Assisted Mithridates.    1. Now, upon the flight of Pompey and of the senate beyond the Ionian  Sea, Caesar got Rome and the empire under his power, and released  Aristobulus from his bonds. He also committed two legions to him, and  sent him in haste into Syria, as hoping that by his means he should  easily conquer that country, and the parts adjoining to Judea. But envy  prevented any effect of Aristobulus's alacrity, and the hopes of Caesar;  for he was taken off by poison given him by those of Pompey's party;  and, for a long while, he had not so much as a burial vouchsafed him  in his own country; but his dead body lay [above ground], preserved in  honey, until it was sent to the Jews by Antony, in order to be buried in  the royal sepulchers.    2. His son Alexander also was beheaded by Scipio at Antioch, and that  by the command of Pompey, and upon an accusation laid against him before  his tribunal, for the mischiefs he had done to the Romans. But Ptolemy,  the son of Menneus, who was then ruler of Chalcis, under Libanus, took  his brethren to him by sending his son Philippio for them to Ascalon,  who took Antigonus, as well as his sisters, away from Aristobulus's  wife, and brought them to his father; and falling in love with the  younger daughter, he married her, and was afterwards slain by his father  on her account; for Ptolemy himself, after he had slain his son, married  her, whose name was Alexandra; on the account of which marriage he took  the greater care of her brother and sister.    3.
