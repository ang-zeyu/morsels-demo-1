A man of my rank and  figure!\" and may look down upon a trader with sovereign contempt; whilst  the trader on the other side, by thus often hearing his profession  treated so disdainfully, is fool enough to blush at it.  However, I need  not say which is most useful to a nation; a lord, powdered in the tip of  the mode, who knows exactly at what o'clock the king rises and goes to  bed, and who gives himself airs of grandeur and state, at the same time  that he is acting the slave in the ante-chamber of a prime minister; or a  merchant, who enriches his country, despatches orders from his counting-  house to Surat and Grand Cairo, and contributes to the well-being of the  world.        LETTER XI.--ON INOCULATION      It is inadvertently affirmed in the Christian countries of Europe that  the English are fools and madmen.  Fools, because they give their  children the small-pox to prevent their catching it; and madmen, because  they wantonly communicate a certain and dreadful distemper to their  children, merely to prevent an uncertain evil.  The English, on the other  side, call the rest of the Europeans cowardly and unnatural.  Cowardly,  because they are afraid of putting their children to a little pain;  unnatural, because they expose them to die one time or other of the small-  pox.  But that the reader may be able to judge whether the English or  those who differ from them in opinion are in the right, here follows the  history of the famed inoculation, which is mentioned with so much dread  in France.    The Circassian women have, from time immemorial, communicated the small-  pox to their children when not above six months old by making an incision  in the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule, taken carefully  from the body of another child.  This pustule produces the same effect in  the arm it is laid in as yeast in a piece of dough; it ferments, and  diffuses through the whole mass of blood the qualities with which it is  impregnated.  The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox  has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper  to others.  There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia;  and when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the  inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations  when their harvest has fallen short.    The circumstance that introduced a custom in Circassia, which appears so  singular to others, is nevertheless a cause common to all nations, I mean  maternal tenderness and interest.    The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed,  it is in them they chiefly trade.  They furnish with beauties the  seraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy, and of all those  who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious  merchandise.  These maidens are very honourably and virtuously instructed  to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and  effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the  pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.  These  unhappy creatures repeat their lesson to their mothers, in the same  manner as little girls among us repeat their catechism without  understanding one word they say.    Now it often happened that, after a father and mother had taken the  utmost care of the education of their children, they were frustrated of  all their hopes in an instant.  The small-pox getting into the family,  one daughter died of it, another lost an eye, a third had a great nose at  her recovery, and the unhappy parents were completely ruined.  Even,  frequently, when the small-pox became epidemical, trade was suspended for  several years, which thinned very considerably the seraglios of Persia  and Turkey.    A trading nation is always watchful over its own interests, and grasps at  every discovery that may be of advantage to its commerce.  The  Circassians observed that scarce one person in a thousand was ever  attacked by a small-pox of a violent kind.  That some, indeed, had this  distemper very favourably three or four times, but never twice so as to  prove fatal; in a word, that no one ever had it in a violent degree twice  in his life.  They observed farther, that when the small-pox is of the  milder sort, and the pustules have only a tender, delicate skin to break  through, they never leave the least scar in the face.  From these natural  observations they concluded, that in case an infant of six months or a  year old should have a milder sort of small-pox, he would not die of it,  would not be marked, nor be ever afflicted with it again.    In order, therefore, to preserve the life and beauty of their children,  the only thing remaining was to give them the small-pox in their infant  years.  This they did by inoculating in the body of a child a pustule  taken from the most regular and at the same time the most favourable sort  of small-pox that could be procured.    The experiment could not possibly fail.  The Turks, who are people of  good sense, soon adopted this custom, insomuch that at this time there is  not a bassa in Constantinople but communicates the small-pox to his  children of both sexes immediately upon their being weaned.    Some pretend that the Circassians borrowed this custom anciently from the  Arabians; but we shall leave the clearing up of this point of history to  some learned Benedictine, who will not fail to compile a great many  folios on this subject, with the several proofs or authorities.  All I  have to say upon it is that, in the beginning of the reign of King George  I., the Lady Wortley Montague, a woman of as fine a genius, and endued  with as great a strength of mind, as any of her sex in the British  Kingdoms, being with her husband, who was ambassador at the Porte, made  no scruple to communicate the small-pox to an infant of which she was  delivered in Constantinople.  The chaplain represented to his lady, but  to no purpose, that this was an unchristian operation, and therefore that  it could succeed with none but infidels.  However, it had the most happy  effect upon the son of the Lady Wortley Montague, who, at her return to  England, communicated the experiment to the Princess of Wales, now Queen  of England.  It must be confessed that this princess, abstracted from her  crown and titles, was born to encourage the whole circle of arts, and to  do good to mankind.  She appears as an amiable philosopher on the throne,  having never let slip one opportunity of improving the great talents she  received from Nature, nor of exerting her beneficence.  It is she who,  being informed that a daughter of Milton was living, but in miserable  circumstances, immediately sent her a considerable present.  It is she  who protects the learned Father Courayer.  It is she who condescended to  attempt a reconciliation between Dr. Clark and Mr. Leibnitz.  The moment  this princess heard of inoculation, she caused an experiment of it to be  made on four criminals sentenced to die, and by that means preserved  their lives doubly; for she not only saved them from the gallows, but by  means of this artificial small-pox prevented their ever having that  distemper in a natural way, with which they would very probably have been  attacked one time or other, and might have died of in a more advanced  age.    The princess being assured of the usefulness of this operation, caused  her own children to be inoculated.  A great part of the kingdom followed  her example, and since that time ten thousand children, at least, of  persons of condition owe in this manner their lives to her Majesty and to  the Lady Wortley Montague; and as many of the fair sex are obliged to  them for their beauty.    Upon a general calculation, threescore persons in every hundred have the  small-pox.  Of these threescore, twenty die of it in the most favourable  season of life, and as many more wear the disagreeable remains of it in  their faces so long as they live.  Thus, a fifth part of mankind either  die or are disfigured by this distemper.  But it does not prove fatal to  so much as one among those who are inoculated in Turkey or in England,  unless the patient be infirm, or would have died had not the experiment  been made upon him.  Besides, no one is disfigured, no one has the small-  pox a second time, if the inoculation was perfect.  It is therefore  certain, that had the lady of some French ambassador brought this secret  from Constantinople to Paris, the nation would have been for ever obliged  to her.  Then the Duke de Villequier, father to the Duke d'Aumont, who  enjoys the most vigorous constitution, and is the healthiest man in  France, would not have been cut off in the flower of his age.    The Prince of Soubise, happy in the finest flush of health, would not  have been snatched away at five-and-twenty, nor the Dauphin, grandfather  to Louis XV., have been laid in his grave in his fiftieth year.  Twenty  thousand persons whom the small-pox swept away at Paris in 1723 would  have been alive at this time.  But are not the French fond of life, and  is beauty so inconsiderable an advantage as to be disregarded by the  ladies?  It must be confessed that we are an odd kind of people.  Perhaps  our nation will imitate ten years hence this practice of the English, if  the clergy and the physicians will but give them leave to do it; or  possibly our countrymen may introduce inoculation three months hence in  France out of mere whim, in case the English should discontinue it  through fickleness.    I am informed that the Chinese have practised inoculation these hundred  years, a circumstance that argues very much in its favour, since they are  thought to be the wisest and best governed people in the world.  The  Chinese, indeed, do not communicate this distemper by inoculation, but at  the nose, in the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2447"],[0,"Eminent Victorians (#8)"],[1,"Newman up to the very point beyond which  his conclusions were logical, and, while they intoned, confessed, swung  incense, and burned candles with the exhilaration of converts, they yet  managed to do so with a subtle nuance which showed that they had nothing  to do with Rome. Various individuals underwent more violent changes.  Several had preceded Newman into the Roman fold; among others an unhappy  Mr. Sibthorpe, who subsequently changed his mind, and returned to the  Church of his fathers, and then--perhaps it was only natural--changed  his mind again. Many more followed Newman, and Dr. Wiseman was  particularly pleased by the conversion of a Mr. Morris, who, as he said,  was 'the author of the essay, which won the prize on the best method of  proving Christianity to the Hindus'. Hurrell Froude had died before  Newman had read the fatal article on St. Augustine; but his brother,  James Anthony, together with Arthur Clough, the poet, went through an  experience which was more distressing in those days than it has since  become; they lost their faith. With this difference, however, that while  in Froude's case the loss of his faith turned out to be rather like the  loss of a heavy portmanteau, which one afterwards discovers to have been  full of old rags and brickbats, Clough was made so uneasy by the loss of  his that he went on looking for it everywhere as long as he lived; but  somehow he never could find it. On the other hand, Keble and Pusey  continued for the rest of their lives to dance in an exemplary manner  upon the tight-rope of High Anglicanism; in such an exemplary manner,  indeed, that the tight-rope has its dancers still.      IV    MANNING was now thirty-eight, and it was clear that he was the rising  man in the Church of England. He had many powerful connections: he was  the brother-in-law of Samuel Wilberforce, who had been lately made a  bishop; he was a close friend of Mr. Gladstone, who was a Cabinet  Minister; and he was becoming well known in the influential circles of  society in London. His talent for affairs was recognised not only in the  Church, but in the world at large, and he busied himself with matters of  such varied scope as National Education, the administration of the Poor  Law, and the Employment of Women. Mr. Gladstone kept up an intimate  correspondence with him on these and on other subjects, mingling in his  letters the details of practical statesmanship with the speculations of  a religious thinker. 'Sir James Graham,' he wrote, in a discussion of  the bastardy clauses of the Poor Law, 'is much pleased with the tone of  your two communications. He is disposed, without putting an end to the  application of the workhouse test against the mother, to make the remedy  against the putative father \"real and effective\" for expenses incurred  in the workhouse. I am not enough acquainted to know whether it would be  advisable to go further. You have not proposed it; and I am disposed to  believe that only with a revived and improved discipline in the Church  can we hope for any generally effective check upon lawless lust.' 'I  agree with you EMINENTLY,' he writes, in a later letter, 'in your  doctrine of FILTRATION. But it sometimes occurs to me, though the  question may seem a strange one, how far was the Reformation, but  especially the Continental Reformation, designed by God, in the region  of final causes, for that purification of the Roman Church which it has  actually realised?'    In his archdeaconry, Manning lived to the full the active life of a  country clergyman. His slim, athletic figure was seen everywhere in the  streets of Chichester, or on the lawns of the neighbouring rectories, or  galloping over the downs in breeches and gaiters, or cutting brilliant  figures on the ice. He was an excellent judge of horse-flesh, and the  pair of greys which drew his hooded phaeton so swiftly through the lanes  were the admiration of the county. His features were already beginning  to assume their ascetic cast, but the spirit of youth had not yet fled  from them, so that he seemed to combine the attractions of dignity and  grace. He was a good talker, a sympathetic listener, a man who  understood the difficult art of preserving all the vigour of a manly  character and yet never giving offence. No wonder that his sermons drew  crowds, no wonder that his spiritual advice was sought for eagerly by an  ever-growing group of penitents; no wonder that men would say, when his  name was mentioned, 'Oh, Manning! No power on earth can keep HIM from a  bishopric!'    Such was the fair outward seeming of the Archdeacon's life; but, the  inward reality was different. The more active, the more fortunate, the  more full of happy promise his existence became, the more persistently  was his secret imagination haunted by a dreadful vision--the lake that  burneth forever with brimstone and fire. The temptations of the Evil One  are many, Manning knew; and he knew also that, for him at least, the  most subtle and terrible of all temptations was the temptation of  worldly success. He tried to reassure himself, but it was in vain. He  committed his thoughts to a diary, weighing scrupulously his every  motive, examining with relentless searchings into the depths of his  heart. Perhaps, after all, his longings for preferment were merely  legitimatehopes for 'an elevation into a sphere of higher usefulness'.  But no, there was something more than that. 'I do feel pleasure,' he  noted, 'in honour, precedence, elevation, the society of great people,  and all this is very shameful and mean.'    After Newman's conversion, he almost convinced himself that his 'visions  of an ecclesiastical future' were justified by the role that he would  play as a 'healer of the breach in the Church of England'. Mr. Gladstone  agreed with him; but there was One higher than Mr. Gladstone, and did He  agree?    'I am pierced by anxious thoughts. God knows what my desires have been  and are, and why they are crossed.... I am flattering myself with a  fancy about depth and reality.... The great question is: Is God enough  for you now? And if you are as now even to the end of life, will it  suffice you?... Certainly I would rather choose to be stayed on God,  than to be in the thrones of the world and the Church. Nothing else will  go into Eternity.'    In a moment of ambition, he had applied for the Readership of Lincoln's  Inn, but, owing chiefly to the hostile influence of the Record, the  appointment had gone elsewhere. A little later, a more important  position was offered to him--the office of sub-almoner to the Queen,  which had just been vacated by the Archbishop of York, and was almost  certain to lead to a mitre. The offer threw Manning into an agony of  self-examination. He drew up elaborate tables, after the manner of  Robinson Crusoe, with the reasons for and against his acceptance of the  post:                   FOR                      AGAINST        1. That it comes unsought.  1. Not therefore to be accepted. Such                                    things are trials as well as leadings.        2. That it is honourable.   2. Being what I am, ought I                                     not therefore to decline it--                                    (1) as humiliation;                                    (2) as revenge on myself                                        for Lincoln's Inn;                                      (3) as a testimony?    And so on. He found in the end ten 'negative reasons', with no  affirmative ones to balance them, and, after a week's deliberation, he  rejected the offer.    But peace of mind was as far off from him as ever. First the bitter  thought came to him that 'in all this Satan tells me I am doing it to be  thought mortified and holy'; and then he was obsessed by the still  bitterer feelings of ineradicable disappointment and regret. He had lost  a great opportunity, and it brought him small comfort to consider that  'in the region of counsels, self-chastisement, humiliation,  self-discipline, penance, and of the Cross', he had perhaps done right.    The crisis passed, but it was succeeded by a fiercer one. Manning was  taken seriously ill, and became convinced that he might die at any  moment. The entries in his Diary grew more elaborate than ever; his  remorse for the past, his resolutions for the future, his protestations  of submission to the will of God, filled page after page of parallel  columns, headings and sub-headings, numbered clauses, and analytical  tables. 'How do I feel about Death?' he wrote.        'Certainly great fear:        1. Because of the uncertainty of our state before God.      2. Because of the consciousness--         (1) of great sins past,         (2) of great sinfulness,         (3) of most shallow repentance.        What shall I do?'    He decided to mortify himself, to read St Thomas Aquinas, and to make  his 'night prayers forty instead of thirty minutes'. He determined  during Lent 'to use no pleasant bread (except on Sundays and feasts)  such as cake and sweetmeat'; but he added the proviso 'I do not include  plain biscuits'. Opposite this entry appears the word 'KEPT'. And yet  his back-slidings were many. Looking back over a single week, he was  obliged to register 'petulance twice' and 'complacent visions'. He heard  his curate being commended for bringing so many souls to God during  Lent, and he 'could not bear it'; but the remorse was terrible: 'I  abhorred myself on the spot, and looked upward for help.' He made out  list upon list of the Almighty's special mercies towards him, and they  included his creation, his regeneration, and (No. 5) 'the preservation  of my life six times to my knowledge:        (1) In illness at the age of nine.      (2) In the water.      (3) By a runaway horse at Oxford.      (4) By the same.      (5) By falling nearly through the ceiling of a church.      (6) Again by a fall of a horse. And I know not   "]]]
