Mecklenberg claims to have  issued the first declaration of independence, and, at the centennial  celebration of this event in May, 1875, proudly accepted for itself  the derisive name given this region by Tarleton's officers, \"The  Hornet's Nest of America.\" This name--first bestowed by British  officers upon Mrs. Brevard's mansion, then Tarleton's headquarters,  where that lady's fiery patriotism and stinging wit discomfited this  General in many a sally--was at last held to include the whole county.  In 1778, only two years after the Declaration of Independence was  adopted, and while the flames of war were still spreading over the  country, Hannah Lee Corbin, of Virginia, the sister of General Richard  Henry Lee, wrote him, protesting against the taxation of women unless  they were allowed to vote. He replied that \"women were already  possessed of that right,\" thus recognizing the fact of woman's  enfranchisement as one of the results of the new government, and it is  on record that women in Virginia did at an early day exercise the  right of voting. New Jersey also specifically secured this right to  women on the 2d of July, 1776--a right exercised by them for more than  a third of a century. Thus our country started into governmental life  freighted with the protests of the Revolutionary Mothers against being  ruled without their consent. From that hour to the present, women have  been continually raising their voices against political tyranny, and  demanding for themselves equality of opportunity in every department  of life.    In 1790, Mary Wollstonecraft's \"Vindication of the Rights of Women,\"  published in London, attracted much attention from liberal minds. She  examined the position of woman in the light of existing civilizations,  and demanded for her the widest opportunities of education, industry,  political knowledge, and the right of representation. Although her  work is filled with maxims of the highest morality and purest wisdom,  it called forth such violent abuse, that her husband appealed for her  from the judgment of her contemporaries to that of mankind. So exalted  were her ideas of woman, so comprehensive her view of life, that  Margaret Fuller, in referring to her, said: \"Mary Wollstonecraft--a  woman whose existence proved the need of some new interpretation of  woman's rights, belonging to that class who by birth find themselves  in places so narrow that, by breaking bonds, they become outlaws.\"  Following her, came Jane Marcet, Eliza Lynn, and Harriet  Martineau--each of whom in the early part of the nineteenth century,  exerted a decided influence upon the political thought of England.  Mrs. Marcet was one of the most scientific and highly cultivated  persons of the age. Her \"Conversations on Chemistry,\" familiarized  that science both in England and America, and from it various male  writers filched their ideas. It was a text-book in this country for  many years. Over one hundred and sixty thousand copies were sold,  though the fact that this work emanated from the brain of a woman was  carefully withheld. Mrs. Marcet also wrote upon political economy, and  was the first person who made the subject comprehensive to the popular  mind. Her manner of treating it was so clear and vivid, that the  public, to whom it had been a hidden science, were able to grasp the  subject. Her writings were the inspiration of Harriet Martineau, who  followed her in the same department of thought at a later period. Miss  Martineau was a remarkable woman. Besides her numerous books on  political economy, she was a regular contributor to the London _Daily  News_, the second paper in circulation in England, for many years  writing five long articles weekly, also to Dickens' _Household Words_,  and the _Westminster Review_. She saw clearly the spirit and purpose  of the Anti-Slavery Movement in this country, and was a regular  contributor to the _National Anti-Slavery Standard_, published in New  York. Eliza Lynn, an Irish lady, was at this time writing leading  editorials for political papers. In Russia, Catharine II., the  absolute and irresponsible ruler of that vast nation, gave utterance  to views, of which, says La Harpe, the revolutionists of France and  America fondly thought themselves the originators. She caused her  grandchildren to be educated into the most liberal ideas, and Russia  was at one time the only country in Europe where political refugees  could find safety. To Catharine, Russia is indebted for the first  proposition to enfranchise the serfs, but meeting strong opposition  she was obliged to relinquish this idea, which was carried to fruition  by her great-grandson, Alexander.    This period of the eighteenth century was famous for the executions of  women on account of their radical political opinions, Madame Roland,  the leader of the liberal party in France, going to the guillotine  with the now famous words upon her lips, \"Oh, Liberty, what crimes are  committed in thy name!\" The beautiful Charlotte Corday sealed with her  life her belief in liberty, while Sophia Lapierre barely escaped the  same fate; though two men, Sieyes and Condorcet, in the midst of the  French Revolution, proposed the recognition of woman's political  rights.    Frances Wright, a person of extraordinary powers of mind, born in  Dundee, Scotland, in 1797, was the first woman who gave lectures on  political subjects in America. When sixteen years of age she heard of  the existence of a country in which freedom for the people had been  proclaimed; she was filled with joy and a determination to visit the  American Republic where the foundations of justice, liberty, and  equality had been so securely laid. In 1820 she came here, traveling  extensively North and South. She was at that time but twenty-two years  of age. Her letters gave Europeans the first true knowledge of  America, and secured for her the friendship of LaFayette. Upon her  second visit she made this country her home for several years. Her  radical ideas on theology, slavery, and the social degradation of  woman, now generally accepted by the best minds of the age, were then  denounced by both press and pulpit, and maintained by her at the risk  of her life. Although the Government of the United States was framed  on the basis of entire separation of Church and State, yet from an  early day the theological spirit had striven to unite the two, in  order to strengthen the Church by its union with the civil power. As  early as 1828, the standard of \"The Christian Party in Politics\" was  openly unfurled. Frances Wright had long been aware of its insidious  efforts, and its reliance upon women for its support. Ignorant,  superstitious, devout, woman's general lack of education made her a  fitting instrument for the work of thus undermining the republic.  Having deprived her of her just rights, the country was new to find in  woman its most dangerous foe. Frances Wright lectured that winter in  the large cities of the West and Middle States, striving to rouse the  nation to the new danger which threatened it. The clergy at once  became her most bitter opponents. The cry of \"infidel\" was started on  every side, though her work was of vital importance to the country and  undertaken from the purest philanthropy. In speaking of her  persecutions she said: \"The injury and inconvenience of every kind and  every hour to which, in these days, a really consistent reformer  stands exposed, none can conceive but those who experience them. Such  become, as it were, excommunicated after the fashion of the old  Catholic Mother Church, removed even from the protection of law, such  as it is, and from the sympathy of society, for whose sake they  consent to be crucified.\"    Among those who were advocating the higher education of women, Mrs.  Emma Willard became noted at this period. Born with a strong desire  for learning, she keenly felt the educational disadvantages of her  sex. She began teaching at an early day, introducing new studies and  new methods in her school, striving to secure public interest in  promoting woman's education. Governor Clinton, of New York, impressed  with the wisdom of her plans, invited her to move her school from  Connecticut to New York. She accepted, and in 1819 established a  school in Watervleit, which soon moved to Troy, and in time built up a  great reputation. Through the influence of Governor Clinton, the  Legislature granted a portion of the educational fund to endow this  institution, which was the first instance in the United States of  Government aid for the education of women. Amos B. Eaton, Professor of  the Natural Sciences in the Rensselaer Institute, Troy, at this time,  was Mrs. Willard's faithful friend and teacher. In the early days it  was her custom, in introducing a new branch of learning into her  seminary, to study it herself, reciting to Professor Eaton every  evening the lesson of the next day. Thus she went through botany,  chemistry, mineralogy, astronomy, and the higher mathematics. As she  could not afford teachers for these branches, with faithful study she  fitted herself. Mrs. Willard's was the first girls' school in which  the higher mathematics formed part of the course, but such was the  prejudice against a liberal education for woman, that the first public  examination of a girl in geometry (1829) created as bitter a storm of  ridicule as has since assailed women who have entered the law, the  pulpit, or the medical profession. The derision attendant upon the  experiment of advancing woman's education, led Governor Clinton to say  in his message to the Legislature: \"I trust you will not be deterred  by commonplace ridicule from extending your munificence to this  meritorious institution.\" At a school convention in Syracuse, 1845,  Mrs. Willard suggested the employment of woman as superintendents of  public"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#8)"],[1,"when he was eight years old he feels that his  professional _debut_ was made in London in June, 1901, when he played  the tremendously difficult Brahms-Paganini Variations. In 1905, when  Bachaus was only twenty-one, he won the famous Rubinstein Prize at  Paris. This consists of 5000 francs offered every five years to young  men between the ages of twenty and twenty-six.    (The following conference was conducted in English and German.)          IV    THE PIANIST OF TO-MORROW    WILHELM BACHAUS      TO-DAY, YESTERDAY AND TO-MORROW    \"It is somewhat surprising how very little difference exists between the  material used in piano teaching to-day and that employed forty or fifty  years ago. Of course, there has been a remarkable amount of new  technical material, exercises, studies, etc., devised, written and  published, and some of this presents the advantage of being an  improvement upon the old--an improvement which may be termed an  advance--but, taken all in all, the advance has been very slight when  compared with the astonishing advances made in other sciences and other  phases of human progress in this time.    \"It would seem that the science of music (for the processes of studying  the art are undoubtedly scientific) left little territory for new  explorers and inventors. Despite the great number of etudes that have  been written, imagine for one moment what a desert the technic of music  would be without Czerny, Clementi, Tausig, Pischna--to say nothing of  the great works of Scarlatti and Bach, which have an effect upon the  technic, but are really great works of musical art.      THE WONDERFUL EFFICACY OF SCALES    \"Personally, I practice scales in preference to all other forms of  technical exercises when I am preparing for a concert. Add to this  arpeggios and Bach, and you have the basis upon which my technical work  stands. Pianists who have been curious about my technical  accomplishments have apparently been amazed when I have told them that  scales are my great technical mainstay--that is, scales plus hard work.  They evidently have thought that I had some kind of alchemic secret,  like the philosopher's stone which was designed to turn the baser metals  into gold. I possess no secrets which any earnest student may not  acquire if he will work in the laboratory of music long enough. There  are certain artistic points which only come with long-continued  experiment.    \"As the chemist finds the desired result by interminable heart-breaking  eliminations, so the artist must weigh and test his means until he finds  the one most likely to produce the most beautiful or the most  appropriate result. But this seeking for the right effect has little to  do with the kind of technic which necessitates one to keep every muscle  employed in piano-playing properly exercised, and I may reiterate with  all possible emphasis that the source of my technical equipment is  scales, scales, scales. I find their continued daily practice not only  beneficial, but necessary. I still find it desirable to practice scales  for half an hour a day.      BACH MUSICALLY OMNIPOTENT    \"It seems almost foolish to repeat what has been said so many times  about the wonderful old cantor of Leipsic, Johann Sebastian Bach.  However, there may still be some who have not yet become acquainted with  the indisputable fact that the practice of Bach is the shortest,  quickest road to technical finish. Busoni has enlarged upon Bach,  impossible as that may seem; but as a modern bridge is sometimes built  upon wonderful old foundations, Busoni has taken the idea of Bach and,  with his penetrative and interpretative ability, has been able to make  the meaning more clear and more effective. Any young pianist who aspires  to have his hands in condition to respond to the subtle suggestions of  his brain may acquire a marvelous foundation by the use of scales, Bach  and arpeggios.      THE OLD THAT IS EVER NEW    \"I have seen many ways and means tried out. Some seem like an attempt to  save time at the expense of thoroughness. Furthermore, the means which  have produced the great pianists of the past are likely to differ but  little from those which will produce the pianists of the future.    \"The ultra-modern teacher who is inclined to think scales old-fashioned  should go to hear de Pachmann, who practices scales every day. De  Pachmann, who has been a virtuoso for a great many years, still finds  daily practice necessary, and, in addition to scales, he plays a great  deal of Bach. To-day his technic is more powerful and more comprehensive  than ever, and he attributes it in a large measure to the simplest of  means.      DIFFICULTIES IN NEW PIANOFORTE COMPOSITIONS    \"I have often been asked if the future of pianoforte composition seemed  destined to alter the technic of the instrument, as did the compositions  of Liszt, for instance. This is a difficult question, but it would seem  that the borderland of pianistic difficulty had been reached in the  compositions and transcriptions of Busoni and Godowsky. The new French  school of Debussy, Ravel and others is different in type, but does not  make any more severe technical demands.    \"However, it is hard for one to imagine anything more complicated or  more difficult than the Godowsky arrangements of the Chopin studies. I  fail to see how pianoforte technic can go much beyond these, unless one  gets more fingers or more hands. Godowsky's treatment of these studies  is marvelous not only from a technical standpoint, but from a musical  standpoint as well. He has added a new flavor to the individual  masterpieces of Chopin. He has made them wonderfully clever and really  very interesting studies in harmony and counterpoint, so that one  forgets their technical intricacies in the beauty of the compositions.  One cannot say that their original beauty has been enhanced, but he has  made them wonderfully fascinating compositions despite their aggravating  complications for the student.      MERE DIFFICULTY NO LONGER ASTOUNDS    \"The day when the show of startling technical skill was sufficient to  make a reputation for a pianist is, fortunately, past. The mechanical  playing devices have possibly been responsible for this. The public  refuses to admire anything that can be done by a machine, and longs for  something finer, more subtle, more closely allied to the soul of the  artist. This does not mean, however, that the necessity for a  comprehensive technic is depreciated. Quite the contrary is true. The  need for an all-comprehensive technic is greater than ever before. But  the public demand for the purely musical, the purely artistic, is being  continually manifested.    \"Modern composers are writing with this in view rather than huge  technical combinations. The giant of to-day, to my mind, is indisputably  Rachmaninoff. He is writing the greatest original music for piano of any  living composer. All of his compositions are pianistic and he does not  condescend to pander to a trifling public taste. He is a man with a  great mind, and, in addition to this, he has a delightful sense of  proportion and a feeling for the beautiful, all of which makes him a  composer of the master mould. His compositions will endure as long as  music.      MODERN COMPOSITIONS    \"For others of the type of Scriabine I care less, although I am sensible  to the beauty of many of their compositions. They have not, however,  the splendid mould of Rachmaninoff, nor have they his vigorous  originality. Doubtless some of these men will produce great original  compositions in the future. Compositions that are simply not bad are  hardly worth the paper they are written upon, for they will not last as  long. The composition that will last is a great, new, original thought,  inspired, noble and elemental, but worked out with the distinctive  craftsmanship of the great master.    \"I am very partial to Debussy. He has an extraordinary atmosphere, and,  after one has formed a taste for him, his compositions are alluring,  particularly his _Homage a Rameau_, _Jardins sous la pluie_ and _D'un  cahier d'esquisses_, which I have been playing upon my American tour.      THE MOST DIFFICULT COMPOSITIONS    \"I have continually been asked, 'What is the most difficult  composition?' The question always amuses me, but I suppose it is very  human and in line with the desire to measure the highest building, the  tallest mountain, the longest river or the oldest castle. Why is such a  premium put upon mere difficulty? Strange to say, no one ever seems to  think it necessary to inquire, 'What is the most beautiful piece?'    \"Difficulty in music should by no means be estimated by technical  complications. To play a Mozart concerto well is a colossally difficult  undertaking. The pianist who has worked for hours to get such a  composition as near as possible to his conception of perfection is never  given the credit for his work, except by a few connoisseurs, many of  whom have been through a similarly exacting experience. Months may be  spent upon comparatively simple compositions, such as the Haydn Sonatas  or the Mozart Sonatas, and the musical public is blind to the additional  finish or polish so evident to the virtuoso.      PRAISE THAT IRRITATES    \"The opposite of this is also true. A little show of bravura, possibly  in a passage which has not cost the pianist more than ten minutes of  frivolous practice, will turn many of the unthinking auditors into a  roaring mob. This is, of course, very distressing to the sincere artist  who strives to establish himself by his real worth.    \"Of course, there are some compositions which present difficulties which  few work hard enough to surmount. Among these might be mentioned the  Godowsky-Chopin _etudes_ (particularly the _etude_ in A flat, Opus 25,  No. 1, which is always especially exasperating for the student  sufficiently advanced to approach it); the _Don Juan Fantasie_ of Liszt;"]]]
