They were couched in the following  terms:                                 NAPLES, October 9, 1815        \"Ferdinand, by the grace of God, etc .  .  .  .  wills and decrees      the following:        \"Art.  1.  General Murat is to be tried by court-martial, the members      whereof are to be nominated by our Minister of War.        \"Art.  2.  Only half an hour is to be accorded to the condemned for      the exercises of religion.        \"(Signed) FERDINAND.\"    Another despatch from the minister contained the names of the members of  the commission. They were:--    Giuseppe Fosculo, adjutant, commander-in-chief of the staff, president.    Laffaello Scalfaro, chief of the legion of Lower Calabria.    Latereo Natali, lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Marines.    Gennaro Lanzetta, lieutenant-colonel of the Engineers.      W. T. captain of Artillery.    Francois de Venge, ditto.    Francesco Martellari, lieutenant of Artillery.    Francesco Froio, lieutenant in the 3rd regiment of the line.    Giovanni delta Camera, Public Prosecutor to the Criminal Courts of Lower  Calabria.    Francesco Papavassi, registrar.    The commission assembled that night.    On the 13th October, at six o'clock in the morning, Captain Stratti came  into the king's prison; he was sound asleep. Stratti was going away  again, when he stumbled against a chair; the noise awoke Murat.    \"What do you want with me, captain?\" asked the king.    Stratti tried to speak, but his voice failed him.    \"Ah ha!\" said Murat, \"you must have had news from Naples.\"    \"Yes, sire,\" muttered Stratti.    \"What are they?\" said Murat.    \"Your trial, sire.\"    \"And by whose order will sentence be pronounced, if you please? Where  will they find peers to judge me? If they consider me as a king, I must  have a tribunal of kings; if I am a marshal of France, I must have a  court of marshals; if I am a general, and that is the least I can be, I  must have a jury of generals.\"    \"Sire, you are declared a public enemy, and as such you are liable to be  judged by court-martial: that is the law which you instituted yourself  for rebels.\"    \"That law was made for brigands, and not for crowned heads, sir,\" said  Murat scornfully. \"I am ready; let them butcher me if they like. I did  not think King Ferdinand capable of such an action.\"    \"Sire, will you not hear the names of your judges?\"    \"Yes, sir, I will. It must be a curious list. Read it: I am listening.\"    Captain Stratti read out the names that we have enumerated. Murat  listened with a disdainful smile.    \"Ah,\" he said, as the captain finished, \"it seems that every precaution  has been taken.\"    \"How, sire?\"    \"Yes. Don't you know that all these men, with the exception of Francesco  Froio, the reporter; owe their promotion to me? They will be afraid of  being accused of sparing me out of gratitude, and save one voice,  perhaps, the sentence will be unanimous.\"    \"Sire, suppose you were to appear before the court, to plead your own  cause?\"    \"Silence, sir, silence!\" said Murat. \"I could, not officially recognise  the judges you have named without tearing too many pages of history.  Such tribunal is quite incompetent; I should be disgraced if I appeared  before it. I know I could not save my life, let me at least preserve my  royal dignity.\"    At this moment Lieutenant Francesco Froio came in to interrogate the  prisoner, asking his name, his age, and his nationality. Hearing these  questions, Murat rose with an expression of sublime dignity.    \"I am Joachim Napoleon, King of the Two Sicilies,\" he answered, \"and I  order you to leave me.\"    The registrar obeyed.    Then Murat partially dressed himself, and asked Stratti if he could  write a farewell to his wife and children. The Captain no longer able to  speak, answered by an affirmative sign; then Joachim sat down to the  table and wrote this letter:    \"DEAR CAROLINE OF MY HEART,--The fatal moment has come: I am to suffer  the death penalty. In an hour you will be a widow, our children will be  fatherless: remember me; never forget my memory. I die innocent; my life  is taken from me unjustly.    \"Good-bye, Achilles good-bye, Laetitia; goodbye, Lucien; good-bye,  Louise.    \"Show yourselves worthy of me; I leave you in a world and in a kingdom  full of my enemies. Show yourselves superior to adversity, and remember  never to think yourselves better than you are, remembering what you have  been.    \"Farewell. I bless you all. Never curse my memory. Remember that the  worst pang of my agony is in dying far from my children, far from my  wife, without a friend to close my eyes. Farewell, my own Caroline.  Farewell, my children. I send you my blessing, my most tender tears, my  last kisses. Farewell, farewell. Never forget your unhappy father,    \"Pizzo, Oct. 13, 1815\"    [We can guarantee the authenticity of this letter, having copied it  ourselves at Pizzo, from the Lavaliere Alcala's copy of the original]    Then he cut off a lock of his hair and put it in his letter. Just then  General Nunziante came in; Murat went to him and held out his hand.    \"General,\" he said, \"you are a father, you are a husband, one day you  will know what it is to part from your wife and sons. Swear to me that  this letter shall be delivered.\"    \"On my epaulettes,\" said the general, wiping his eyes. [Madame Murat  never received this letter.]    \"Come, come, courage, general,\" said Murat; \"we are soldiers, we know  how to face death. One favour--you will let me give the order to fire,  will you not?\"    The general signed acquiescence: just then the registrar came in with  the king's sentence in his hand.    Murat guessed what it was.    \"Read, sir,\" he said coldly; \"I am listening.\"    The registrar obeyed. Murat was right.    The sentence of death had been carried with only one dissentient voice.    When the reading was finished, the king turned again to Nunziante.    \"General,\" he said, \"believe that I distinguish in my mind the  instrument which strikes me and the hand that wields that instrument. I  should never have thought that Ferdinand would have had me shot like a  dog; he does not hesitate apparently before such infamy. Very well. We  will say no more about it. I have challenged my judges, but not my  executioners. What time have you fixed for my execution?\"    \"Will you fix it yourself, sir?\" said the general.    Murat pulled out a watch on which there was a portrait of his wife; by  chance he turned up the portrait, and not the face of the watch; he  gazed at it tenderly.    \"See, general,\" he said, showing it to Nunziante; \"it is a portrait of  the queen. You know her; is it not like her?\"    The general turned away his head. Murat sighed and put away the watch.    \"Well, sire,\" said the registrar, \"what time have you fixed?\"    \"Ah yes,\" said Murat, smiling, \"I forgot why I took out my watch when I  saw Caroline's portrait.\"    Then he looked at his watch again, but this time at its face.    \"Well, it shall be at four o'clock, if you like; it is past three  o'clock. I ask for fifty minutes. Is that too much, sir?\"    The registrar bowed and went out. The general was about to follow him.    \"Shall I never see you again, Nunziante?\" said Murat.    \"My orders are to be present at your death, sire, but I cannot do it.\"    \"Very well, general. I will dispense with your presence at the last  moment, but I should like to say farewell once more and to embrace you.\"    \"I will be near, sire.\"    \"Thank you. Now leave me alone.\"    \"Sire, there are two priests here.\"    Murat made an impatient movement.    \"Will you receive them?\" continued the general.    \"Yes; bring them in.\"    The general went out. A moment later, two priests appeared in the  doorway. One of them was called Francesco Pellegrino, uncle of the man  who had caused the king's death; the other was Don Antonio Masdea.    \"What do you want here?\" asked Murat.    \"We come to ask you if you are dying a Christian?\"    \"I am dying as a soldier. Leave me.\"    Don Francesco Pellegrino retired. No doubt he felt ill at ease before  Joachim. But Antonio Masdea remained at the door.    \"Did you not hear me?\" asked the king.    \"Yes, indeed,\" answered the old man; \"but permit me, sire, to hope that  it was not your last word to me. It is not, the first time that I see  you or beg something of you. I have already had occasion to ask a favour  of you.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"When your Majesty came to Pizzo in 1810, I asked you for 25,000 francs  to enable us to finish our church. Your Majesty sent me 40,000 francs.\"    \"I must have foreseen that I should be buried there,\" said Murat,  smiling.    \"Ah, sire, I should like to think that you did not refuse my second boon  any more than my first. Sire, I entreat you on my knees.\"    The old man fell at Murat's feet.    \"Die as a Christian!\"    \"That would give you pleasure, then, would it?\" said the king.    \"Sire, I would give the few short days remaining to me if God would  grant that His Holy Spirit should fall upon you in your last hour.\"    \"Well,\" said Murat, \"hear my confession. I accuse myself of having been  disobedient to my parents as a child. Since I reached manhood I have  done nothing to reproach myself with.\"    \"Sire, will you give me an attestation that you die in the Christian  faith?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Murat.    And he took a pen and wrote: \"I, Joachim Murat, die a Christian,  believing in the Holy Catholic Church, Apostolic and Roman.\"    He signed it.    \"Now, father,\" continued the king, \"if you have a third favour to ask of  me, make haste, for in half an hour it will be too late.\"    Indeed, the castle clock was striking half-past three. The priest signed  that he had finished.    \"Then leave me alone,\" said Murat; and the old man went out.    Murat paced his room for a few moments, then he sat down on his bed and  let his head fall into his hands.

Military - note  This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance  not included elsewhere.    Money figures  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.    National holiday  This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.    Nationality  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.    Natural Gas - consumption  This entry is the total quantity of natural gas consumed in cubic  meters. The discrepancy between the quantity of natural gas produced  and/or imported and the quantity consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural Gas - exports  This entry is the total quantity of natural gas exported in cubic  meters.    Natural Gas - imports  This entry is the total quantity of natural gas imported in cubic  meters.    Natural Gas - production  This entry is the total quantity of natural gas produced in cubic  meters. The discrepancy between the quantity of natural gas produced  and/or imported and the quantity consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural Gas - proved reserves  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic  meters (cu. m.). Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas,  which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated  with a high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a  given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    Natural hazards  This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other  resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate  This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of  persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as  net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall  level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems  such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people  are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain  key sectors (if people are leaving).    Oil - consumption  This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per day (bbl/day). The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - exports  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - production  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per day (bbl/day). The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - proved reserves  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of crude oil in barrels  (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by  analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a  high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a given  date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    People  This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of  the people and their society.    People - note  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization  The Factbook uses all uppercase letters for personal names by which the  subject is usually referred to in various media. An example is  President Vicente FOX Quesada of Mexico. Members of royal families are  usually referred by other than their family name (King and Prime  Minister FAHD bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Queen BEATRIX of  the Netherlands, or King PHUMIPHON Adunyadet of Thailand). Some Asians  are referred to by the first element of their name - also their  surname, such as President NO Muh-hyun of South Korea.    Personal Names - Spelling  The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows the  same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names  for spelling place names. At times, however, a foreign leader expressly  indicates a preference for, or the media or official documents  regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard. In such cases,  the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing alone is  lowercased. Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs of  state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is  the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both  chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum  See \"Oil\" entries    Petroleum products  See \"Oil\" entries    Pipelines  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.    Political parties and leaders  This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders  This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in  politics, but not standing for legislative election.    Population  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on  assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one  overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and  within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic  estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken  into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana,  Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,  Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South  Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line  National estimates of the percentage of the population lying below the  poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results  weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty  vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally  employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.    Population growth rate  The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a  surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.  The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be  imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for  infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources  (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can  be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and harbors  This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected on the basis of  overall importance to each country.  This is determined by evaluating a  number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,  facilities, military significance).    Radio broadcast stations  This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast  stations.    Railways  This entry states the total route length of the railway network and of  its component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and other.    Reference maps  This section includes world and regional maps.    Religions  This entry includes a rank ordering of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population.    Sex ratio  This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age  groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and  for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an  indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For  instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now  attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong  preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and  fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult  males who are unable to find partners.    Suffrage  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to  vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers  All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in  brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and  the local number. The one component that is not presented is the  international access code, which varies from country to country. For  example, an international direct dial telephone"]]]
