[Illustration: Seisure of Ammunition in Savannah 060]    The first response of the Liberty Boys at Savannah was to seize the  ammunition stored in the magazine. This event occurred on the night of  the 11th of May, and was planned and carried out by the members of the  Council of Safety. About six hundred pounds of powder fell into the  hands of the Liberty Boys. Some was sent to South Carolina, and the rest  was hidden in the garrets and cellars of the patriots who had seized it.  Tradition says that some of this powder was sent to Massachusetts, where  it was used by the patriots who drove the British before them at the  battle of Bunker Hill.    Other events occurred that showed the temper of the Liberty Boys. On the  4th of June, when Governor Wright came to fire salutes in honor of King  George's birthday, he found the cannon had been spiked, dismounted, and  rolled to the bottom of the bluff. On the 5th of June the first liberty  pole in the Colony was set up at Savannah. A young man named Hopkins,  who spoke contemptuously of the members of the Committee of Public  Safety was seized by a mob, tarred and feathered, placed in an  illuminated cart, and paraded up and down the streets of Savannah.    As the days went by, the independence movement in Georgia became more  enthusiastic, the Liberty Boys more active. The first vessel armed and  equipped for naval warfare during the Revolution was fitted up by  the Liberty Boys of Georgia under the authority of the Provincial  Convention, which had assembled in Savannah on the 4th of July, 1775.  This event is interesting. The Carolina Committee of Safety had heard  that a British ship had sailed for Georgia with a cargo of powder  intended for the Indians and for the use of the Royalists. The  Carolinians at once resolved to capture the ship and seize the cargo.  To that end, two barges, manned by forty well-armed men, were embarked  from Beaufort, and went to the mouth of the Savannah River, where they  encamped on a point that commanded a full view of Tybee Lighthouse. The  Provincial Convention, hearing of this expedition, offered to assist the  officers in every way possible. There was an armed British schooner in  the river at that time; and the Liberty Boys of Savannah determined to  join forces with the Carolinians at Tybee, and effect her capture. For  this purpose a schooner was equipped by the Provincial Convention, and  placed under command of Captain Bowen and Joseph Habersham. This vessel  was armed with ten carriage guns and swivels, and carried fifty men. The  British armed vessel was not inclined to enter into a contest, but,  when the Georgia schooner appeared, weighed anchor and sailed away. The  schooner then took position beyond the harbor bar, and waited for the  ship carrying the cargo of powder. She had not long to wait. On the 10th  of July, 1775, the powder ship, commanded by Captain Maitland, made her  appearance. Before entering Tybee Inlet, however, Captain Maitland saw  the armed schooner. Suspecting that he was about to fall into a trap, he  brought his vessel round, tacked, and stood out to sea. But he had gone  too far. The Georgia schooner gave chase, and soon overtook and captured  the ship. It was a fortunate capture for the Colonies. Five thousand  pounds of powder were sent to Philadelphia, and nine thousand fell to  the share of Georgia.    The convention that commissioned the first armed vessel of the  Revolution did more important work than this. It placed the Province  of Georgia in political union with her sister Colonies, and gave her  fellowship with those struggling Provinces. She was welcomed into the  United Colonies with joyful demonstrations by the Continental Congress.  By the 15th of April, 1776, the Liberty Boys in Georgia were so strong  that Governor Wright had taken refuge on one of the King's vessels at  Tybee; and on that date the patriots took full charge of the government  of the Province. Archibald Bulloch was the first republican president of  Georgia.    This is how the Liberty Boys took the Province of Georgia from his  Majesty the King, and made a free and independent government. Their  struggle did not end here, but the details of that struggle must be left  to history to relate.          A GROUP OF CHARACTERS    The Revolutionary War in Georgia developed some very romantic figures,  which are known to us rather by tradition than by recorded history.  First among them, on the side of the patriots, was Robert Sallette.  Neither history nor tradition gives us the place of his birth or the  date of his death; yet it is known that he played a more important part  in the struggle in the Colony than any man who had no troops at his  command. He seems to have slipped mysteriously on the scene at the  beginning of the war. He fought bravely, even fiercely, to the end,  and then, having nothing else to do, slipped away as mysteriously as  he came. \"In Liberty County,\" says history, \"there lived during the  Revolution a man by the name of Robert Sallette, distinguished for  his opposition to the Tories. It is not known with certainty to what  particular command he was attached. He appears to have been a sort of  roving character, doing things in his own way.\" Here is the mystery of  romance to begin with. Here is the wanderer,--the character so dear to  the imagination of youth.    \"The Tories,\" says history further, \"stood very much in dread of him;  and well they might, for never had they a more, formidable foe.\" Here,  then, is the hero and the wanderer combined in one person, and  that person fighting for the holiest cause in which man can take up  arms,--the rights and liberties of the people. What more could be asked?    Curious as we may be to know something of the personal history of Robert  Sallette, it is not to be found chronicled in the books. The French  twist to his name makes it probable that he was a descendant of those  unfortunate Acadians who, years before, had been stripped of their lands  and possessions in Nova Scotia by the British, their houses and barns  burned, and they themselves transported away from their homes. They were  scattered at various points along the American coast. Some were landed  at Philadelphia, and some were carried to Louisiana. Four hundred were  sent to Georgia. The British had many acts of cruelty to answer for in  those days, but none more infamous than this treatment of the gentle and  helpless Acadians. It stands in history to-day a stain upon the British  name.    Another fact that leads to the belief that Robert Sallette was a  descendant of the unfortunate Acadians was the ferocity with which he  pursued the British and the Tories. The little that is told about  him makes it certain that he never gave quarter to the enemies of his  country.    His name was a terror to the Tories. One of them, a man of considerable  means, offered a reward of one hundred guineas to any person who would  bring him the head of Robert Sallette. The Tory had never seen Sallette,  but his alarm was such that he offered a reward large enough to tempt  some one to assassinate the daring partisan. When Sallette heard of the  reward, he disguised himself as a farmer, and provided himself with  a pumpkin, which he placed in a bag. With the bag swinging across his  shoulder, he made his way to the house of the Tory. He was invited in,  and deposited the bag on the floor beside him, the pumpkin striking the  boards with a thump.    [Illustration: The head of Robert Sallette 066]    \"I have brought you the head of Robert Sallette,\" said he. \"I hear that  you have offered a reward of one hundred guineas for it.\"    \"Where is it?\" asked the Tory.    \"I have it with me,\" replied Sallette, shaking the loose end of the bag.  \"Count me out the money and take the head.\"    The Tory, neither doubting nor suspecting, counted out the money, and  placed it on the table.    \"Now show me the head,\" said he.    Sallette removed his hat, tapped himself on the forehead, and said,  \"Here is the head of Robert Sallette!\"    The Tory was so frightened that he jumped from the room, and Sallette  pocketed the money and departed.    On one occasion Robert Sallette is known to have spared the lives of two  Tories, at least for a little while. Once when he and Andrew Walthour  (for whom Walthourville in Georgia is named) and another man were riding  along a narrow trail late in the afternoon, they met three other  riders whom they suspected to be Tories. The plan that Sallette and his  companions adopted to capture the men was very simple. Andrew Walthour,  who was riding in front, was to pass the first and second men, Robert  Sallette to pass the first. As Walthour came to the third man when  Sallette had come to the second, and their companion to the first, the  Liberty Boys seized the guns of the three simultaneously. The men had no  opportunity either to fight or escape.    \"Dismount, gentlemen!\" said Sallette. Then he addressed himself to the  leader. \"What is your name?\"    In reply to this, a fictitious name was given, as Sallette and his  companions afterwards found out.    \"Where is your camp?\" asked Sallette.    \"We are from over the river,\" answered the man, meaning the Altamaha.    \"Where did you cross?\"    \"At Beards Ferry.\" This was where the Whigs and the Liberty Boys were  most numerous.    \"That is not true!\" exclaimed Sallette.    Then he turned to the second man, asked the same questions, and received  the same replies. He turned to the third man, asked the same questions,  and received the same replies.    \"If you do not tell me the truth,\" exclaimed Sallette to this last man,  \"I'll cut off your head!\"    The man persisted, and Sallette was as good as his word. The others  begged for their lives, and declared that they would guide Sallette  straight to their camp.

Still she wore round her neck Brisingamen, the necklace that lost her  Odur. But now she wore it, not for its splendor, but as a sign of the  wrong she had done. She weeps, and her tears become golden drops as they  fall on the earth. And by poets who know her story she is called The  Beautiful Lady in Tears.          [Illustration]    HOW FREY WON GERDA, THE GIANT MAIDEN, AND HOW HE LOST HIS MAGIC SWORD      Frey, chief of the Vanir, longed to have sight of his sister who had  been from Asgard for so long. (You must know that this happened during  the time when Freya was wandering through the world, seeking her  husband, the lost Odur.) Now there was in Asgard a place from which one  could overlook the world and have a glimpse of all who wandered there.  That place was Hlidskjalf, Odin's lofty Watch-Tower.    High up into the blue of the air that Tower went. Frey came to it and he  knew that Odin All-Father was not upon Hlidskjalf. Only the two wolves,  Geri and Freki, that crouched beside Odin's seat at the banquet, were  there, and they stood in the way of Frey's entrance to the Tower. But  Frey spoke to Geri and Freki in the language of the Gods, and Odin's  wolves had to let him pass.    But, as he went up the steps within the Tower, Frey, chief of the Vanir,  knew that he was doing a fateful thing. For none of the High Gods, not  even Thor, the Defender of Asgard, nor Baldur, the Best-Beloved of the  Gods, had ever climbed to the top of that Tower and seated themselves  upon the All-Father's seat. \"But if I could see my sister once I should  be contented,\" said Frey to himself, \"and no harm can come to me if I  look out on the world.\"    He came to the top of Hlidskjalf. He seated himself on Odin's lofty  seat. He looked out on the world. He saw Midgard, the World of Men, with  its houses and towns, its farms and people. Beyond Midgard he saw  Joetunheim, the Realm of the Giants, terrible with its dark mountains and  its masses of snow and ice. He saw Freya as she went upon her  wanderings, and he marked that her face was turned toward Asgard and  that her steps were leading toward the City of the Gods. \"I have  contented myself by looking from Hlidskjalf,\" said Frey to himself, \"and  no harm has come to me.\"    But even as he spoke his gaze was drawn to a dwelling that stood in the  middle of the ice and snow of Joetunheim. Long he gazed upon that  dwelling without knowing why he looked that way. Then the door of the  house was opened and a Giant maiden stood within the doorway. Frey gazed  and gazed on her. So great was the beauty of her face that it was like  starlight in that dark land. She looked from the doorway of the house,  and then turned and went within, shutting the door.    Frey sat on Odin's high seat for long. Then he went down the steps of  the Tower and passed by the two wolves, Geri and Freki, that looked  threateningly upon him. He went through Asgard, but he found no one to  please him in the City of the Gods. That night sleep did not come to  him, for his thoughts were fixed upon the loveliness of the Giant maid  he had looked upon. And when morning came he was filled with loneliness  because he thought himself so far from her. He went to Hlidskjalf again,  thinking to climb the Tower and have sight of her once more. But now the  two wolves, Geri and Freki, bared their teeth at him and would not let  him pass, although he spoke to them again in the language of the Gods.    He went and spoke to wise Nioerd, his father. \"She whom you have seen, my  son,\" said Nioerd, \"is Gerda, the daughter of the Giant Gymer. You must  give over thinking of her. Your love for her would be an ill thing for  you.\"    \"Why should it be an ill thing for me?\" Frey asked.    \"Because you would have to give that which you prize most for the sake  of coming to her.\"    \"That which I prize most,\" said Frey, \"is my magic sword.\"    \"You will have to give your magic sword,\" said his father, the wise  Nioerd.    \"I will give it,\" said Frey, loosening his magic sword from his belt.    \"Bethink thee, my son,\" said Nioerd. \"If thou givest thy sword, what  weapon wilt thou have on the day of Ragnaroek, when the Giants will make  war upon the Gods?\"    Frey did not speak, but he thought the day of Ragnaroek was far off. \"I  cannot live without Gerda,\" he said, as he turned away.    There was one in Asgard who was called Skirnir. He was a venturesome  being who never cared what he said or did. To no one else but Skirnir  could Frey bring himself to tell of the trouble that had fallen on  him--the trouble that was the punishment for his placing himself on the  seat of the All-Father.    Skirnir laughed when he heard Frey's tale. \"Thou, a Van, in love with a  maid of Joetunheim! This is fun indeed! Will ye make a marriage of it?\"    \"Would that I might even speak to her or send a message of love to her,\"  said Frey. \"But I may not leave my watch over the Elves.\"    \"And if I should take a message to Gerda,\" said Skirnir the Venturesome,  \"what would my reward be?\"    \"My boat Skidbladnir or my boar Golden Bristle,\" said Frey.    \"No, no,\" said Skirnir. \"I want something to go by my side. I want  something to use in my hand. Give me the magic sword you own.\"    Frey thought upon what his father said, that he would be left weaponless  on the day of Ragnaroek, when the Giants would make war upon the Gods and  when Asgard would be endangered. He thought upon this, and drew back  from Skirnir, and for a while he remained in thought. And all the time  thick-set Skirnir was laughing at him out of his wide mouth and his blue  eyes. Then Frey said to himself, \"The day of Ragnaroek is far off, and I  cannot live without Gerda.\"    He drew the magic sword from his belt and he placed it in Skirnir's  hand. \"I give you my sword, Skirnir,\" he said. \"Take my message to  Gerda, Gymer's daughter. Show her this gold and these precious jewels,  and say I love her, and that I claim her love.\"    \"I shall bring the maid to you,\" said Skirnir the Venturesome.    \"But how wilt thou get to Joetunheim?\" said Frey, suddenly remembering  how dark the Giants' land was and how terrible were the approaches to  it.    \"Oh, with a good horse and a good sword one can get anywhere,\" said  Skirnir. \"My horse is a mighty horse, and you have given me your sword  of magic. Tomorrow I shall make the journey.\"    Skirnir rode across Bifroest, the Rainbow Bridge, laughing out of his  wide mouth and his blue eyes at Heimdall, the Warder of the Bridge to  Asgard. His mighty horse trod the earth of Midgard, and swam the river  that divides Midgard, the World of Men, from Joetunheim, the Realm of the  Giants. He rode on heedlessly and recklessly, as he did all things. Then  out of the iron forests came the monstrous wolves of Joetunheim, to tear  and devour him and his mighty horse. It was well for Skirnir that he had  in his belt Frey's magic sword. Its edge slew and its gleam frighted  the monstrous beasts. On and on Skirnir rode on his mighty horse. Then  he came to a wall of fire. No other horse but his mighty horse could go  through it. Skirnir rode through the fire and came to the dale in which  was Gymer's dwelling.    And now he was before the house that Frey had seen Gerda enter on the  day when he had climbed Hlidskjalf, Odin's Watch-Tower. The mighty  hounds that guarded Gymer's dwelling came and bayed around him. But the  gleam of the magic sword kept them away. Skirnir backed his horse to the  door, and made his horse's hooves strike against it.    Gymer was in the feast hall drinking with his Giant friends, and he did  not hear the baying of the hounds nor the clatter that Skirnir made  before the door. But Gerda sat spinning with her maidens in the hall.  \"Who comes to Gymer's door?\" she said.    \"A warrior upon a mighty horse,\" said one of the maidens.    \"Even though he be an enemy and one who slew my brother, yet shall we  open the door to him and give him a cup of Gymer's mead,\" said Gerda.    One of the maidens opened the door and Skirnir entered Gymer's dwelling.  He knew Gerda amongst her maidens. He went to her and showed her the  rich gold and the precious jewels that he had brought from Frey. \"These  are for you, fairest Gerda,\" he said, \"if you will give your love to  Frey, the Chief of the Vanir.\"    \"Show your gold and jewels to other maidens,\" said Gerda. \"Gold and  jewels will never bring me to give my love.\"    Then Skirnir the Venturesome, the heedless of his words, drew the magic  sword from his belt and held it above her. \"Give your love to Frey, who  has given me this sword,\" he said, \"or meet your death by the edge of  it.\"    Gerda, Gymer's daughter, only laughed at the reckless Skirnir, \"Make the  daughters of men fearful by the sharpness of Frey's sword,\" she said,  \"but do not try to frighten a Giant's daughter with it.\"    Then Skirnir the Reckless, the heedless of his words, made the magic  sword flash before her eyes, while he cried out in a terrible voice,  saying a spell over her:         Gerda, I will curse thee;       Yes, with this magic       Blade I shall touch thee;       Such is its power       That, like a thistle,       Withered 'twill leave thee,       Like a thistle the wind       Strips from the roof.    Hearing these terrible words and the strange hissings of the magic  sword, Gerda threw herself on the ground, crying out for pity. But  Skirnir stood above her, and the magic sword flashed and hissed over  her. Skirnir sang:         More ugly I'll leave thee       Than maid ever was;       Thou wilt be mocked at       By men and by Giants;       A Dwarf only will wed thee;       Now on this instant       With this blade I shall touch thee,       And leave thee bespelled.    She lifted herself on her knees and cried out to Skirnir to spare her  from the spell of the magic sword.    \"Only if thou wilt give thy love to Frey,\" said Skirnir.    \"I will give my love to him,\" said Gerda. \""]]]
