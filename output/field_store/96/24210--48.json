He is very feeble, but keeps his great grandchildren in       line while their mother works. They live in Beaumont. Joe is tall,       slight, and has gray hair and a stubby gray mustache. In his kind,       gentle voice he relates his experiences in slavery days.      \"Dey calls me Paul Barnes, but my name ain't Paul, it am Joe.

He is the husband of Harriett       Barrett. Armstead has a very poor memory and can tell little about       early days. He and Harriet receive old age pensions.      \"I's really owned by Massa Stafford Barrett, but my mammy 'longed to  Massa Ben Walker and was 'lowed to keep me with her. So after we'uns got  free, I lives with my daddy and mammy and goes by de name of Barrett.

That is one reason why glaciated New England contains over  forty per cent of all the developed water-power in the United States.    Far more important, however, than the glacial lakes and rivers is the  fertile glacial soil. It comes fresh from the original rocks and has not  yet been exhausted by hundreds of thousands of years of weathering.  It also has the advantage of being well mixed, for generally it is the  product of scrapings from many kinds of rocks, each of which contributes  its own particular excellence to the general composition. Take Wisconsin  as an example. * Most parts of that State have been glaciated, but in  the southwest there lies what is known as the \"driftless area\" because  it is not covered with the \"drift\" or glacial debris which is thickly  strewn over the rest of the State. A comparison of otherwise similar  counties lying within and without the driftless area shows an  astonishing contrast. In 1910 the average value of all the farm land in  twenty counties covered with drift amounted to $56.90 per acre. In six  counties partly covered with drift and partly driftless the value was  $59.80 per acre, while in thirteen counties in the driftless area it was  only $33.30 per acre. In spite of the fact that glaciation causes swamps  and lakes, the proportion of land cultivated in the glaciated areas is  larger than in the driftless. In the glaciated area 61 per cent of the  land is improved and in the driftless area only 43.5 per cent. Moreover,  even though the underlying rock and the original topography be of the  same kind in both cases, the average yield of crops per acre is greater  where the ice has done its work. Where the country rock consists of  limestone, which naturally forms a rich soil, the difference in favor  of the glaciated area amounts to only 1 or 2 per cent. Where the country  rock is sandy, the soil is so much improved by a mixture of fertilizing  limestone or even of clay and other materials that the average yield  of crops per acre in the glaciated areas is a third larger than in the  driftless. Taking everything into consideration it appears that the  ancient glaciation of Wisconsin increases the present agricultural  output by from 20 to 40 per cent. Upwards of 10,000,000 acres of  glaciated land have already been developed in the most populous parts of  the State. If the average value of all products on this area is reckoned  at $15 per acre and if the increased value of agricultural products due  to glaciation amounts to 30 per cent, then the net value of glaciation  per year to the farmers of Wisconsin is $45,000,000. This means about  $300 for each farmer in the glaciated area.          * R. H. Whitbeck, \"Economic Aspects of Glaciation in Wisconsin\",  in \"Annals of the Association of American Geographers,\" vol. III in  (1913), pp. 62-67.      Wisconsin is by no means unique. In Ohio, for instance, there is also  a driftless area. * It lies in the southeast along the Ohio River. The  difference in the value of the farm land there and in the glaciated  region is extraordinary. In the driftless area the average value per  acre in 1910 was less than $24, while in the glaciated area it was  nearly $64. Year by year the proportion of the population of the State  in the unglaciated area is steadily decreasing. The difference between  the two parts of the State is not due to the underlying rock structure  or to the rainfall except to a slight degree. Some of the difference is  due to the fact that important cities such as Cleveland and Toledo lie  on the fertile level strip of land along the lake shore, but this strip  itself, as well as the lake, owes much of its character to glaciation.  It appears, therefore, that in Ohio, perhaps even more than in  Wisconsin, man prospers most in the parts where the ice has done its  work.          * William H. Hess, \"The Influence of Glaciation in Ohio,\" in  \"Bulletin of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia,\" vol. XV (1917),  pp. 19-42.      We have taken Wisconsin and Ohio as examples, but the effect of  glaciation in those States does not differ materially from its effect  all over southern Canada and the northern United States from New England  to Kansas and Minnesota. Each year the people of these regions are  richer by perhaps a billion dollars because the ice scraped its way down  from Laurentia and spread out over the borders of the great plains on  the west and of the Appalachian region on the east.    We have considered the Laurentian highland and the glaciation which  centered there. Let us now turn to another highland only the northern  part of which was glaciated. The Appalachian highland, the second great  division of North America, consists of three parallel bands which extend  southwestward from Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence River to Georgia  and Alabama. The eastern and most important band consists of hills and  mountains of ancient crystalline rocks, somewhat resembling those of the  Laurentian highland but by no means so old. West of this comes a broad  valley eroded for the most part in the softer portions of a highly  folded series of sedimentary rocks which are of great age but younger  than the crystalline rocks to the east. The third band is the Alleghany  plateau, composed of almost horizontal rocks which lie so high and have  been so deeply dissected that they are often called mountains.    The three Appalachian bands by no means preserve a uniform character  throughout their entire length. The eastern crystalline band has its  chief development in the northeast. There it comprises the whole of New  England and a large part of the maritime provinces of Canada as well as  Newfoundland. Its broad development in New England causes that region to  be one of the most clearly defined natural units of the United States.  Ancient igneous rocks such as granite lie intricately mingled with old  and highly metamorphosed sediments. Since some of the rocks are hard and  others soft and since all have been exposed to extremely long erosion,  the topography of New England consists typically of irregular masses  of rounded hills free from precipices. Here and there hard masses of  unusually resistant rock stand up as isolated rounded heights, like  Mount Katahdin in Maine. They are known as \"monadnocks\" from the  mountain of that name in southern New Hampshire. In other places larger  and more irregular masses of hard rock form mountain groups like the  White Mountains, the Green Mountains, and the Berkshires, each of which  is merely a great series of monadnocks.    In the latitude of southern New York the crystalline rocks are  compressed into narrow compass and lose their mountainous character.  They form the irregular hills on which New York City itself is built and  which make the suburbs of Westchester County along the eastern Hudson  so diverse and beautiful. To the southeast the topography of the old  crystalline band becomes still less pronounced, as may be seen in the  rolling, fertile hills around Philadelphia. Farther south the band  divides into two parts, the mountains proper and the Piedmont plateau.  The mountains begin at the Blue Ridge, which in Virginia raises its  even-topped heights mile after mile across the length of that State. In  North Carolina, however, they lose their character as a single ridge  and expand into the broad mass of the southern Appalachians. There Mount  Mitchell dominates the eastern part of the American continent and is  surrounded by over thirty other mountains rising to a height of at least  six thousand feet. The Piedmont plateau, which lies at the eastern foot  of the Blue Ridge, is not really a plateau but a peneplain or ancient  lowland worn almost to a plain. It expands to a width of one hundred  miles in Virginia and the Carolinas and forms the part of those States  where most of the larger towns are situated. Among its low gentle  heights there rises an occasional little monadnock like Chapel Hill,  where the University of North Carolina lies on a rugged eminence which  strikingly recalls New England. For the most part, however, the hills  of the Piedmont region are lower and more rounded than those in  the neighborhood of Philadelphia. The country thus formed has many  advantages, for it is flat enough to be used for agriculture and yet  varied enough to be free from the monotony of the level plains.    The prolonged and broken inner valley forming the second band of the  Appalachians was of some importance as a highway in the days of the  Indians. Today the main highways of traffic touch it only to cross it as  quickly as possible. From Lake Champlain it trends straight southward in  the Hudson Valley until the Catskills have been passed. Then, while the  railroads and all the traffic go on down the gorge of the Hudson to  New York, the valley swings off into Pennsylvania past Scranton,  Wilkesbarre, and Harrisburg. There the underlying rock consists of a  series of alternately hard and soft layers which have been crumpled up  much as one might wrinkle a rug with one's foot. The pressure involved  in the process changed and hardened the rocks so much that the coal  which they contain was converted into anthracite, the finest coal in all  the world and the only example of its kind. Even the famous Welsh coal  has not been so thoroughly hardened. During a long period of erosion the  tops of the folded layers were worn off to a depth of thousands of feet  and the whole country was converted into an almost level plain. Then  in the late geological period known as the early Tertiary the land was  lifted up again, and once more erosion went on. The soft rocks were thus  etched away until broad valleys were formed. The hard layers were left  as a bewildering succession of ridges with flat tops. A single ridge  may double back and forth so"]]]
