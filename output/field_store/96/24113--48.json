With me this is not a simple impression, but a       firm conviction.\"[15]             [Footnote 15: \"John Bull & Co.,\" by \"Max O'Rell,\" 1894.]    [Sidenote: Jameson's decision.]    If these were the considerations which weighed with Dr. Jameson, his  decision to \"ride in\" was inconsistent neither with friendship nor  with patriotism. When Captain Heany had read from his pocket-book the  message from the Reformers, Jameson paced for twenty minutes outside  his tent. Having re-entered it, he announced his determination to  disregard Heany's message no less than Rhodes's telegram. It was a  momentous decision to take after twenty minutes' thought. Had he a  reasonable expectation of carrying out the plan as Rhodes conceived  it, in spite of the change in the position of affairs at Johannesburg?  Had he any reason to believe that Rhodes desired him to force the  insurrection in spite of his telegrams to the contrary? It is the  answers to these questions that make the Raid, as far as Dr. Jameson  is concerned, an \"act of monumental folly,\" or a legitimate assumption  of personal responsibility that is part of the empire-builder's  stock-in-trade. The answer to the second question remains a matter of  speculation. The answer to the first is to be found in the record of  the expedition. Dr. Jameson reached Kruegersdorp at three o'clock on  Wednesday, January 1st. A few hours before a cyclist had brought him  congratulatory messages from the Reform leaders. The goal was almost  within sight. What prevented Sir John Willoughby from taking his  little force safely over the remaining twenty miles from Kruegersdorp  to Johannesburg was the merest accident: the few hours' delay caused,  naturally enough, by Dr. Jameson's desire that his force should be met  and escorted by a small body of volunteers from the Rand. He did not  want, as he said, to go to Johannesburg as \"a pirate.\" Sir John  Willoughby's evidence is perfectly definite and conclusive on the  point. If the force had pushed on by road from Kruegersdorp to  Johannesburg on Wednesday evening--had not, in Willoughby's words,  \"messed about\" at Kruegersdorp in expectation of the welcoming  escort--Johannesburg would have been reached in safety on Thursday  morning. With Dr. Jameson in Johannesburg and Lord Rosmead speeding  northwards in his special train, the way would have been prepared for  that decisive and successful action on the part of the Imperial  Government which Rhodes had desired to bring about.    [Sidenote: Why the raid failed.]    But, unsuccessful as was the actual expedition, the decision to \"ride  in\" had secured the intervention of the Imperial Government. If  intervention could have done what Rhodes expected of it, Dr. Jameson's  decision to \"ride in\" would have gained, at the cost of few lives and  no increase of the national debt, what the war gained four years later  at the cost of twenty thousand lives and L220,000,000. As it was, it  failed to win the franchise for the Uitlanders. Why did not Lord  Rosmead, with so strong a Colonial Secretary as Mr. Chamberlain at his  back, brush the Raid aside, and address himself to the removal of the  greater wrong that gave it birth? If Lord Rosmead had acted in the  spirit of Mr. Chamberlain's despatches; if he had reminded the  Government of the Republic from the first \"that the danger from which  they had just escaped was real, and one which, if the causes which led  up to it were not removed, might recur, although in a different form\";  if he had used \"plain language\" to President Krueger; and if, above  all, he had remembered--as Mr. Chamberlain reminded him--that \"the  people of Johannesburg had surrendered in the belief that reasonable  concessions would have been arranged through his intervention, and  until these were granted, or were definitely promised to him by the  President, the root-causes of the recent troubles would  remain,\"--might he not yet have saved South Africa for the empire  without subjecting her to the dread arbitrament of the sword?    [Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain.]    It is in the answer to this question that we find the actual cause of  the utter failure of Rhodes's plan. The truth is that success in any  real sense--that is to say, success which would have strengthened  British supremacy and promoted the union of European South Africa--was  impossible. The sole response which Lord Rosmead returned to Mr.  Chamberlain's counsels was the weary confession: \"The question of  concessions to Uitlanders has never been discussed between President  Krueger and myself.\" The methods employed by Rhodes were so  questionable that no High Commissioner could have allowed the Imperial  Government to have derived any advantage from them. To have gained the  franchise for the Uitlanders as the result of violent and unscrupulous  action, would have inflicted an enduring injury upon the British cause  in South Africa for which the enfranchisement itself would have been  small compensation. The disclosure of these methods and, with them, of  the hollowness of Rhodes's alliance with the Afrikander Bond, alarmed  and incensed the whole Dutch population of South Africa. What this  meant Lord Rosmead knew, and Mr. Chamberlain did not know. The ten  years' truce between the forces of the Afrikander nationalists and the  paramount Power was at an end. To combat these forces something better  than the methods of the Raid was required. _Non tali auxilio, nec  defensoribus istis!_ No modern race have excelled the Dutch in courage  and endurance. In Europe they had successfully defended their  independence against the flower of the armies of Spain, Austria, and  France. The South African Dutch were not inferior in these qualities  to the people of the parent stock. If such a race, embarked upon what  it conceived to be a struggle for national existence, was to be  overcome, the hands of the conqueror must be clean as well as strong.  None the less the active sympathy with the Uitlanders exhibited in Mr.  Chamberlain's despatches was welcomed by the British as evidence that  the new Colonial Secretary was more alert and determined than his  predecessors. For the first time in the history of British  administration in South Africa, Downing Street had shown itself more  zealous than Capetown. It was the solitary ray of light that broke the  universal gloom in which South Africa was enshrouded by the  catastrophe of the Raid.          CHAPTER II    THE CREED OF THE AFRIKANDER NATIONALISTS[16]             [Footnote 16: \"This is our Afrikander character. The           descendants of Hollanders, Germans and Frenchmen           inter-married, and are only known at present by their           surnames. They form the Afrikander nationality, and call           themselves Afrikanders. The Afrikanders are no more           Hollanders than Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Germans. They have           their own language, own morals and customs; they are just as           much a nation as any other.\"--_De Patriot_, in the course of           an article headed \"A Common but Dangerous Error\"--the error           in question being the assertion that \"the Cape Colony is an           English colony\" (translated and reproduced in _The Cape           Times_, September 3th, 1884).]      In the face of the colossal resistance offered to the British arms by  the Boers and their colonial kinsmen in the South African War, it may  seem unnecessary to produce any evidence in support of the contention  that the military strength then displayed by the Dutch in South Africa  was the result of long and careful preparation. But the same inability  to grasp the facts of the South African situation which kept the Army  Corps in England three months after it should have been sent to the  Cape, is still to be met with. This attitude of mind--whether it be a  consciousness of moral rectitude, or a mere insular disdain of looking  at things from any but a British point of view--is still to be  observed in the statements of those politicians who will even now deny  that any trace of a definite plan of action, or of a concerted  purpose, which could properly be described as a \"conspiracy\" against  British supremacy was to be found among the Dutch population of South  Africa as a whole, prior to the outbreak of the war. It is for the  benefit of such politicians in part, and still more with a view of  bringing the mind of the reader into something approaching a direct  contact with the actual working of the Afrikander mind, that I  transcribe a statement of the pure doctrine of the Bond, as it was  expounded by the German, Borckenhagen, and his followers in the Free  State. It will, however, be convenient to preface the quotation with a  word of explanation in respect both of the text and the personality of  Borckenhagen.    [Sidenote: Carl Borckenhagen.]    The passage, which is taken _verbatim_ from a work entitled, \"The  Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed,\" is a collection of sentences  gathered from Dutch pamphlets and articles \"emanating from Holland,\"  and translated literally into the somewhat uncouth English of the  text. The author of the work, Mr. C. H. Thomas, was for many years a  burgher of the Free State, where he shared the opinions of President  Brand, and subsequently supported Mr. J. G. Fraser in opposing the  policy of \"closer union\" with the South African Republic, advocated by  Brand's successor, Mr. F. W. Reitz. The point of view from which the  Dutch of Holland regarded the nationalist movement in South Africa was  succinctly stated in an article published by the Amsterdam  _Handelsblad_ in 1881.         \"The future of England lies in India, and the future of Holland       in South Africa....

For  all the look of curious anger with which his father was intently  watching, the son stole the tongue and conveyed it to the floor. No  sooner had he done so, than the offended sire rushed upon him, rolled  him over, beat him, and took away the tongue. Instead, though, of  replacing it on the table, the father contented himself with the  punishment he had administered, and retired with great gravity to the  fire.    \"I was once waiting by moonlight for wild ducks on the Ouze in  Bedfordshire, and I killed a couple on the water at a shot. The  current was strong; but Shark, having fetched one of the birds, was  well aware there was another. Instead, therefore, of returning by  water to look for the second, he ran along the banks, as if aware that  the strong stream would have carried the bird further down; looking in  the water till he saw it, at least a hundred yards from the spot where  he had left it in bringing the first; when he also brought that to me.  Nothing could induce either of these dogs to fetch a glove or a stick:  I have often seen game fall close to me, and they would not attempt to  touch it. It seemed as if they simply desired to be of service when  service was to be done; and that when there were no obstacles to be  conquered, they had no wish to interfere. Shark died at a good old  age, and was succeeded by his son Wolfe. Wolfe's mother was a  Newfoundland bitch. He was also a large and powerful dog, but of  course not so speedy as his ancestors. While residing at my country  house, being my constant companion, Wolfe accompanied me two or three  times a-day in the breeding season to feed the young pheasants and  partridges reared under hens. On going near the coops, I put down my  gun, made Wolfe a sign to sit down by it, and fed the birds, with  some caution, that they might not be in any way scared. I mention  this, because I am sure that dogs learn more from the manner and  method of those they love, than they do from direct teaching. In front  of the windows on the lawn there was a large bed of shrubs and  flowers, into which the rabbits used to cross, and where I had often  sent Wolfe in to drive them for me to shoot. One afternoon, thinking  that there might be a rabbit, I made Wolfe the usual sign to go and  drive the shrubs, which he obeyed; but ere he had gone some yards  beneath the bushes, I heard him make a peculiar noise with his jaws,  which he always made when he saw anything he did not like, and he came  softly back to me with a sheepish look. I repeated the sign, and  encouraged him to go; but he never got beyond the spot he had been to  in the first instance, and invariably returned to me with a very odd  expression of countenance. Curiosity tempted me to creep into the  bushes to discover the cause of the dog's unwonted behaviour; when  there, I found, congregated under one of the shrubs, eight or nine of  my young pheasants, who had for the first time roosted at a distance  from their coop. Wolfe had seen and known the young pheasants, and  would not scare them.    \"Wolfe was the cause of my detecting and discharging one of my  gamekeepers. I had forbidden my rabbits to be killed until my return;  and the keeper was ordered simply to walk Wolfe to exercise on the  farm. There was a large stone quarry in the vicinity, where there  were a good many rabbits, some parts of which were so steep, that  though you might look over the cliff, and shoot a rabbit below,  neither man nor dog could pick him up without going a considerable way  round. On approaching the edge of the quarry to look over for a  rabbit, I was surprised at missing Wolfe, who invariably stole off in  another direction, but always the same way. At last, on shooting a  rabbit, I discovered that he invariably went to the only spot by which  he could descend to pick up whatever fell to the gun; and by this I  found that somebody had shot rabbits in his presence at times when I  was from home.    \"Wolfe accompanied me to my residence in Hampshire, and there I  naturalised, in a wild state, some white rabbits. For the first year  the white ones were never permitted to be killed, and Wolfe saw that  such was the case. One summer's afternoon I shot a white rabbit for  the first time, and Wolfe jumped the garden fence to pick the rabbit  up; but his astonishment and odd sheepish look, when he found it was a  white one, were curious in the extreme. He dropped his stern, made his  usual snap with his jaws, and came back looking up in my face, as much  as to say, 'You've made a mistake, and shot a white rabbit, but I've  not picked him up.' I was obliged to assure him that I intended to  shoot it, and to encourage him before he would return and bring the  rabbit to me. Wolfe died when he was about nine years old, and was  succeeded by my present favourite, Brenda, a hare greyhound of the  highest caste. Brenda won the Oak stakes of her year, and is a very  fast and stout greyhound. I have taught her to retrieve game to the  gun, to drive home the game from dangerous sands, and, in short, to do  everything but speak; and this she attempts, by making a beautiful  sort of bark when she wants her dinner.    \"I have the lop-eared rabbit naturalised, and in a half-wild and wild  state, and Brenda is often to be seen with some of the tamest of them  asleep in the sun on the lawn together. When the rabbits have been  going out into a dangerous vicinity, late in the evening, I have often  sent Brenda to drive them home, and to course and kill the wild ones  if she could. I have seen one of the wild-bred lop-ears get up before  her, and I have seen her make a start to course it; but when she saw  that it was not a native of the soil she would stop and continue her  search for others. The next moment I have seen her course and kill a  wild rabbit. She is perfectly steady from hare if I tell her not to  run, and is, without any exception, one of the prettiest and most  useful and engaging creatures ever seen. She is an excellent  rat-killer also, and has an amazing antipathy to a cat. When I have  been absent from home for some time, Mrs. B. has observed that she is  alive to every sound of a wheel, and if the door-bell rings she is the  first to fly to it. When walking on the sea-beach during my absence,  she is greatly interested in every boat she sees, and watches them  with the most intense anxiety, as in the yachting season she has known  me return by sea. Brenda would take my part in a row, and she is a  capital house-dog. If ever the heart of a creature was given to man,  this beautiful, graceful, and clever animal has given me hers, for her  whole existence is either passed in watching for my return, or in  seeking opportunities to please me when I am at home. It is a great  mistake to suppose that severity of treatment is necessary to the  education of a dog, or that it is serviceable in making him steady.  Manner--_marked and impressive manner_--is that which teaches  obedience, and example rather than command forms the desired  character.    \"I had two foxhounds when I hunted stag,--my pack were all  foxhounds,--they were named Bachelor and Blunder. We used to play with  them together, and they got to know each other by name. In returning  from hunting, my brother and myself used to amuse ourselves by saying,  in a peculiar tone of voice,--the one we used to use in playing with  them--'Bachelor, where's Blunder?' On hearing this, Bachelor's stern  and bristles rose, and he trotted about among the pack, looking for  Blunder, and when he found him he would push his nose against his ear  and growl at him. Thus Bachelor evidently knew Blunder by name, and  this arose from the way in which we used to play with them. At this  moment, when far away from home, and after an absence of many weeks,  if I sing a particular song, which I always sing to a dog named  Jessie, Brenda, though staying in houses where she had never seen  Jessie, will get up much excited, and look to the door and out of the  window in expectation of her friend. I have a great pleasure in the  society of all animals, and I love to make my house a place where all  may meet in rest and good fellowship. This is far easier to achieve  than people would think for when dogs are kindly used, but impressed  with ideas of obedience.    \"The gazelle which came home from Acre in the Thunderer, was one  evening feeding from Mrs. B.'s plate at dessert, when Odion, the great  deerhound, who was beaten in my match against the five deer by an  unlucky stab in the first course, came in by special invitation for  his biscuit. The last deer he had seen previous to the gazelle he had  coursed and pulled down. The strange expression of his dark face was  beautiful when he first saw her; and halting in his run up to me, he  advanced more slowly directly to her, she met him also in apparent  wonder at his great size, and they smelled each others' faces. Odion  then kissed her, and came to me for his biscuit, and never after  noticed her. She will at times butt him if he takes up too much of the  fire; but this she will not do to Brenda, except in play; and if she  is eating from Mrs. Berkeley's hand, Brenda by a peculiar look can  send her away and take her place. Odion, the gazelle, Brenda, and the  rabbits, will all quietly lay on the lawn together, and the gazelle  and Bruiser, an immense house-dog between the bloodhound and mastiff,  will run and play together.    \"I had forgotten to mention a bull-and-mastiff dog that I had, called  Grumbo. He was previous to Smoaker, and was indeed the first  four-footed companion established in my confidence. I was then very  young, and of course inclined to anything like a row. Grumbo,  therefore, was well entered in all kinds of strife--bulls, oxen, pigs,  men, dogs, all came in turn as combatants; and Grumbo had the oddest  ways of making men and animals the _aggressors_ I ever knew.
