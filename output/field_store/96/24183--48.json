III. The Assembly having considered the book of consecration and  ordination, findeth it to have been framed by the Prelats, to have been  introduced and practised without warrand of authority, either civill or  ecclesiasticall: and that it establisheth offices in Gods house, which are  not warranded by the word of God, and are repugnant to the Discipline, and  constitutions of our Kirk, that it is an impediment to the entrie of fit  and worthie men to the ministery, and to the discharge of their dutie  after their entrie, conforme to the discipline of our Kirk. Therefore the  Assembly all in one voice hath rejected and condemned, and by these  presents doe reject and condemne the said book; and prohibits the use and  practise of the same: And ordaines Presbyteries to proceed with the  censure of the Kirk against all such as shall transgresse.    IV. The generall Assembly, after due tryall, having found that the Court  of high Commission, hath been erected without the consent or procurement  of the Kirk, or consent of the Estates in Parliament, that it subverteth  the jurisdiction and ordinarie judicatories and Assemblies of the  Kirk-Sessions, Presbyteries, provinciall and nationall Assemblies, that it  is not regulate by lawes civill or ecclesiasticall, but at the discretion  and arbitrement of the Commissioners; that it giveth to ecclesiasticall  persons, the power of both the swords, and to persons meerly civill, the  power of the keys and Kirk censures: Therefore the Assembly all in one  voice, hath disallowed and condemned, and by these presents doth disallow  and condemne the said court, as unlawfull in it selfe, and prejudiciall to  the liberties of Christ--Kirk and Kingdome, the Kings honour in maintaining  the established lawes and judicatories of the Kirk; and prohibits the use  and practise of the same; and ordaines Presbyteries to proceed with the  censures of the Kirk, against all such as shall transgresse.    After the serious discussing of the several Processes, in many Sessions,  from Sess. 14. (which are in the Clerks hands, and needeth not here to be  insert) the following sentences were solemnly pronounced after Sermon by  the Moderatour, in the Assembly of _Glasgow_, _Sess. 20 December 13,  1638._        _Sentence of deposition and excommunication against Mr._ John Spottiswood,  _pretended Archbishop of St._ Andrews; _Mr._ Patrik Lindsay, _pretended  Archbishop of_ Glasgow: _Mr._ David Lindsay, _pretended Bishop of_  Edinburgh: _Mr._ Thomas Sidserfe, _pretended Bishop of_ Galloway: _Mr._  John Maxwell, _pretended Bishop of_ Rosse: _Mr._ Walter Whyt-foord,  _pretended Bishop of_ Brechen.

Confiscation of estates would, he  thought, be a proper measure. He said on one occasion: \"Traitors should  take a back seat in the work of restoration.... My judgment is that he  [a rebel] should be subjected to a severe ordeal before he is restored  to citizenship. Treason should be made odious, and traitors must be  punished and impoverished. Their great plantations must be seized,  and divided into small farms and sold to honest, industrious men.\"  The violence of Johnson's views subsequently underwent considerable  modification but to the last he held to the plan of executive  restoration based upon state perdurance. Neither Lincoln nor Johnson  favored a change of Southern institutions other than the abolition of  slavery, though each recommended a qualified Negro suffrage.    There were, however, other theories in the field, notably those of the  radical Republican leaders. According to the state-suicide theory of  Charles Sumner, \"any vote of secession or other act by which any State  may undertake to put an end to the supremacy of the Constitution within  its territory is inoperative and void against the Constitution, and when  sustained by force it becomes a practical ABDICATION by the State of  all rights under the Constitution, while the treason it involves still  further works an instant FORFEITURE of all those functions and powers  essential to the continued existence of the State as a body politic,  so that from that time forward the territory falls under the exclusive  jurisdiction of Congress as other territory, and the State, being  according to the language of the law felo de se, ceases to exist.\"  Congress should punish the \"rebels\" by abolishing slavery, by giving  civil and political rights to Negroes, and by educating them with the  whites.    Not essentially different, but harsher, was Thaddeus Stevens's plans  for treating the South as a conquered foreign province. Let the victors  treat the seceded States \"as conquered provinces and settle them with  new men and exterminate or drive out the present rebels as exiles.\"  Congress in dealing with these provinces was not bound even by the  Constitution, \"a bit of worthless parchment,\" but might legislate as it  pleased in regard to slavery, the ballot, and confiscation. With  regard to the white population, he said: \"I have never desired bloody  punishments to any great extent. But there are punishments quite as  appalling, and longer remembered, than death. They are more advisable,  because they would reach a greater number. Strip a proud nobility of  their bloated estates; reduce them to a level with plain republicans;  send them forth to labor, and teach their children to enter the  workshops or handle a plow, and you will thus humble the proud  traitors.\" Stevens and Sumner agreed in reducing the Southern States  to a territorial status. Sumner would then take the principles of the  Declaration of Independence as a guide for Congress, while Stevens would  leave Congress absolute. Neither considered the Constitution as of any  validity in this crisis.    As a rule the former abolitionists were in 1865 advocates of votes and  lands for the Negro, in whose capacity for self-rule they had complete  confidence. The view of Gerrit Smith may be regarded as typical of the  abolitionist position:    \"Let the first condition of peace with them be that no people in the  rebel States shall ever lose or gain civil or political rights by reason  of their race or origin. The next condition of peace be that our black  allies in the South--those saviours of our nation--shall share with  their poor white neighbors in the subdivisions of the large landed  estates of the South. Let the only other condition be that the rebel  masses shall not, for say, a dozen years, be allowed access to the  ballot-box, or be eligible to office; and that the like restrictions be  for life on their political and military leaders.. .. The mass of the  Southern blacks fall, in point of intelligence, but little, if  any, behind the mass of the Southern whites.... In reference to the  qualifications of the voter, men make too much account of the head and  too little of the heart. The ballot-box, like God, says: 'Give me your  heart.' The best-hearted men are the best qualified to vote; and, in  this light, the blacks, with their characteristic gentleness, patience,  and affectionateness, are peculiarly entitled to vote. We cannot wonder  at Swedenborg's belief that the celestial people will be found in the  interior of Africa; nor hardly can we wonder at the legend that the gods  came down every year to sup with their favorite Africans.\"    One of the most statesmanlike proposals was made by Governor John  A. Andrew of Massachusetts. If, forgetting their theories, the  conservatives could have united in support of a restoration conceived in  his spirit, the goal might have been speedily achieved. Andrew demanded  a reorganization, based upon acceptance of the results of the war, but  carried through with the aid of \"those who are by their intelligence and  character the natural leaders of their people and who surely will lead  them by and by. These men cannot be kept out forever,\" said he, \"for  the capacity of leadership is a gift, not a device. They whose courage,  talents, and will entitle them to lead, will lead .... If we cannot  gain their support of the just measures needful for the work of safe  reorganization, reorganization will be delusive and full of danger. They  are the most hopeful subjects to deal with. They have the brain and the  experience and the education to enable them to understand... the present  situation. They have the courage as well as the skill to lead the people  in the direction their judgments point.... Is it consistent with reason  and our knowledge of human nature, to believe the masses of Southern men  able to face about, to turn their backs on those they have trusted and  followed, and to adopt the lead of those who have no magnetic hold on  their hearts or minds? It would be idle to reorganize by the colored  vote. If the popular vote of the white race is not to be had in favor of  the guarantees justly required, then I am in favor of holding on--just  where we are now. I am not in favor of a surrender of the present  rights of the Union to a struggle between a white minority aided by  the freedmen on one hand, against the majority of the white race on the  other. I would not consent, having rescued those states by arms from  Secession and rebellion, to turn them over to anarchy and chaos.\"    The Southerners, Unionists as well as Confederates, had their views  as well, but at Washington these carried little influence. The former  Confederates would naturally favor the plan which promised best for the  white South, and their views were most nearly met by those of President  Lincoln. Although he held that in principle a new Union had arisen  out of the war, as a matter of immediate political expediency he was  prepared to build on the assumption that the old Union still existed.  The Southern Unionists cared little for theories; they wanted the  Confederates punished, themselves promoted to high offices, and the  Negro kept from the ballot box.    Even at the beginning of 1866, it was not too much to hope that the  majority of former Republicans would accept conservative methods,  provided the so-called \"fruits of the war\" were assured--that is,  equality of civil rights, the guarantee of the United States war debt,  the repudiation of the Confederate debt, the temporary disfranchisement  of the leading Confederates, and some arrangement which would keep the  South from profiting by representation based on the non-voting Negro  population. But amid many conflicting policies, none attained to  continuous and compelling authority.    The plan first put to trial was that of President Lincoln. It was a  definite plan designed to meet actual conditions and, had he lived, he  might have been able to carry it through successfully. Not a  theorist, but an opportunist of the highest type, sobered by years  of responsibility in war time, and fully understanding the precarious  situation in 1865, Lincoln was most anxious to secure an early  restoration of solidarity with as little friction as possible. Better  than most Union leaders he appreciated conditions in the South, the  problem of the races, the weakness of the Southern Unionists, and the  advantage of calling in the old Southern leaders. He was generous and  considerate; he wanted no executions or imprisonments; he wished the  leaders to escape; and he was anxious that the mass of Southerners be  welcomed back without loss of rights. \"There is,\" he declared, \"too  little respect for their rights,\" an unwillingness, in short, to treat  them as fellow citizens.    This executive policy had been applied from the beginning of the war  as opportunity offered. The President used the army to hold the Border  States in the Union, to aid in \"reorganizing\" Unionist Virginia and in  establishing West Virginia. The army, used to preserve the Union might  be used also to restore disturbed parts of it to normal condition.  Assuming that the \"States\" still existed, \"loyal\" state governments were  the first necessity. By his proclamation of December 8, 1863, Lincoln  suggested a method of beginning the reconstruction: he would pardon any  Confederate, except specified classes of leaders, who took an oath  of loyalty for the future; if as many as ten percent of the voting  population of 1860, thus made loyal, should establish a state government  the executive would recognize it. The matter of slavery must, indeed,  be left to the laws and proclamations as interpreted by the courts, but  other institutions should continue as in 1861.    This plan was inaugurated in four States which had been in"]]]
