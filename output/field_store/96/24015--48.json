The Possum turned pale and the Wombat hastily got behind him.    'Puddin',' said the Possum, acting amazement. 'What strange request is  this?'    'What means this strange request?' asked the Wombat.    'No bungfoodlin',' said Bill sternly. 'Produce the Puddin' or prepare  for death.'    [Illustration]    'Before bringing accusations,' said the Possum, 'prove where the Puddin'  is.'    'It's under that feller's hat,' roared Bill, pointing at the Wombat.    'Prove it,' said the Wombat.    'You can't wear hats that high, without there's puddin's under them,'  said Bill.    'That's not puddin's,' said the Possum; 'that's ventilation. He wears  his hat like that to keep his brain cool.'    'Very well,' said Bill. 'I call on Ben Brandysnap, as an independent  witness whose bag has been stolen, to prove what's under that hat.'    Ben put on his spectacles in order to study the Wombat carefully, and  gravely pronounced this judgement--      'When you see a hat    Stuck up like that      You remark with some surprise,    \"Has he been to a shop,    And bought for his top      A hat of the largest size?\"      'Or else you say,    As you note the way      He wears it like a wreath,    \"It cannot be fat    That bulges his hat;      He's got something underneath.\"      'But whether or not    It's a Puddin' he's got      Can only be settled by lifting his pot.    Or by taking a stick,    A stone or a brick,      And hitting him hard on the head with it quick.    If he yells, you hit fat,    If he doesn't, well that      Will prove it's a Puddin' that's under his hat.'    'Now are you satisfied?' asked Bill, and they all shouted--      'Hurrah! hurray!      Just listen to that;    He knows the way      To bell the cat.    You'd better obey      His judgement pat,      'Without delay      Remove the hat;    It's tit-for-tat,      We tell you flat,    You'll find it pay      To lift your hat.      'Obey the mandate of our chosen lawyer,    Remove that hat, or else we'll do it faw yer.'    'No, no,' said the Possum, shaking his head. 'No removing people's hats.  Removing hats is larceny, and you'll get six months for it.'    'No bashing heads, either,' said the Wombat. 'That's manslaughter, and  we'll have you hung for it.'    Bill scratched his head. 'This is an unforeseen predicament,' he said.  'Just mind them puddin'-thieves a minute, Ben, while we has a word in  private.' He took Sam and Bunyip aside, and almost gave way to despair.  'What a frightful situation,' wailed he. 'We can't unlawfully take a  puddin'-thief's hat off, and while it remains on who's to prove our  Puddin's under it? This is one of the worst things that's happened to  Sam and me for years.'    'It's worse than being chased by wart-hogs,' said Sam.    'It's worse than rolling off a cowshed,' said Bill.    'It's worse than wearing soup tureens for hats,' said Sam.    'It's almost as bad as swallowing thistle buttons,' said Bill, and both  sang loudly--      'It's worse than running in a fright,      Pursued by Polar bears;    It's worse than being caught at night      By lions in their lairs.      'It's worse than barrel organs when      They play from night till morn;    It's worse than having large-sized men      A-standing on your corn.      'It's worse than when at midnight you      Tread on a silent cat,    To have a puddin'-snatcher who      Will not remove his hat.'    'All is not yet lost,' said Bunyip Bluegum. 'Without reverting to  violent measures, I will engage to have the hat removed.'    'You will?' exclaimed Bill, grasping Bunyip by the hand.    'I will,' said Bunyip firmly. 'All I ask is that you strike a dignified  attitude in the presence of these scoundrels, and, at a given word,  follow my example.'    They all struck a dignified attitude in front of the puddin'-thieves,  and Bunyip Bluegum, raising his hat, struck up the National Anthem, the  others joining in with superb effect.    'Hats off in honour to our King,' shouted Bill, and off came all the  hats. The puddin'-thieves, of course, were helpless. The Wombat had to  take his hat off, or prove himself disloyal, and there was Puddin'  sitting on his head.    [Illustration]    'Now who's a liar?' shouted Bill, hitting the Possum a swinging blow on  the snout, while Sam gave the Wombat one of his famous over-arm flip  flaps that knocked all the wind out of him. The Wombat tried to escape  punishment by shouting, 'Never strike a man with a Puddin' on his head';  but, now that their guilt was proved, Bill and Sam were utterly  remorseless, and gave the puddin'-thieves such a trouncing that their  shrieks pierced the firmament. When this had been done, all hands gave  them an extra thumping in the interests of common morality. Eggs were  rubbed in their hair by Benjimen, and Bill and Sam attended to the  beating and snout-bending, while Bunyip did the reciting. Standing on a  stump, he declaimed--    [Illustration]      'The blows you feel we do not deal      In common, vulgar thumping;    To higher motives we appeal--    It is to teach you not to steal,      Your head we now are bumping.      You need not go on pumping    Appeals for kinder dealing,      We like to watch you jumping,    We like to hear you squealing.      We rather think this thumping    Will take a bit of healing.      We hope these blows upon the nose,      These bended snouts, these tramped-on toes,    These pains that you are feeling    The truth will be revealing    How wrong is puddin'-stealing.'    Then, with great solemnity, he recited the following fine moral lesson--    [Illustration]      'A puddin'-thief, as I've heard tell,      Quite lost to noble feeling,    Spent all his days, and nights as well,      In constant puddin'-stealing.      'He stole them here, he stole them there,      He knew no moderation;    He stole the coarse, he stole the rare,      He stole without cessation.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      'He stole the steak-and-kidney stew      That housewives in a rage hid;    He stole the infant's Puddin' too,      The Puddin' of the aged.      'He lived that Puddin's he might lure,      Into his clutches stealthy;    He stole the Puddin' of the poor,      The Puddin' of the wealthy.      'This evil wight went forth one night      Intent on puddin'-stealing,    When he beheld a hidden light      A secret room revealing.      'Within he saw a fearful man,      With eyes like coals a-glowing,    Whose frightful whiskers over-ran      His face, like weeds a-blowing;      'And there this fearful, frightful man,      A sight to set you quaking,    With pot and pan and curse and ban,      Began a Puddin' making.    [Illustration]      ''Twas made of buns and boiling oil,      A carrot and some nails-O!    A lobster's claws, the knobs off doors,      An onion and some snails-O!      'A pound of fat, an old man rat,      A pint of kerosene-O!    A box of tacks, some cobbler's wax,      Some gum and glycerine-O!      'Gunpowder too, a hob-nailed shoe,      He stirred into his pottage;    Some Irish stew, a pound of glue,      A high explosive sausage.      'The deed was done, that frightful one,      With glare of vulture famished,    Blew out the light, and in the night      Gave several howls, and vanished.      'Our thieving lout, ensconced without,      Came through the window slinking;    He grabbed the pot and on the spot      Began to eat like winking.      'He ate the lot, this guzzling sot--      Such appetite amazes--    Until those high explosives wrought    Within his tum a loud report,      And blew him all to blazes.      'For him who steals ill-gotten meals      Our moral is a good un.    We hope he feels that it reveals      The danger he is stood in    Who steals a high explosive bomb,      Mistaking it for Puddin'.'    [Illustration]    The puddin'-thieves wept loudly while this severe rebuke was being  administered, and promised, with sobs, to amend their evil courses, and  in the future to abstain from unlawful puddin'-snatching.    'Your words,' said the Possum, 'has pierced our brains with horror and  remorse'; and the Wombat added: 'From this time onwards our thoughts  will be as far removed from Puddin' as is the thoughts of angels.'    'We have heard that before,' said Bunyip Bluegum; 'but let us hope that  this time your repentance is sincere. Let us hope that the tenderness of  your snouts will be, if I may be permitted a flight of poetic fancy, a  guiding star to lure your steps along the path of virtue--      'For he who finds his evil course is ended    By having of his snout severely bended,    Along that path of virtue may be sent    Where virtuous snouts are seldom ever bent.'    With that the puddin'-thieves went over the hill, the sun went down and  evening arrived, punctual to the minute.    'Ah,' said Bill. 'It's a very fortunate thing that evenin's come along  at this time, for, if it hadn't, we couldn't have waited dinner any  longer. But, before preparin' for a night of gaiety, dance, and song, I  have a proposal to put before my feller Puddin'-owners. I propose to  invite our friend Ben here to join us round the camp fire. He has proved  himself a very decent feller, free with his eggs, and as full of revenge  against puddin'-thieves as ourselves.'    'Hospitably spoken,' said Bunyip Bluegum, and the Puddin'-owners sang--      'Come join us we intreat,      Come join us we implore,    In Friendship's name our guest we claim,      And Friendship's name is law.      'We've Puddin' here a treat,      We've Puddin' here galore;    Do not decline to stay and dine,      Our Puddin' you'll adore.      'Our Puddin', we repeat,    You really cannot beat,      And here are we its owners three    Who graciously intreat      You'll be at our request,      The Puddin'-owners' guest.'    'For these sentiments of esteem, admiration, and respect,' said Ben, 'I  thank you.

In this case, the relative difference in hardness  between the two is small, so that the glass can only be scratched and  not \"cut\" by the nail; it is too hard for that, so the noise is much  greater and becomes a screech. Experience, therefore, makes it possible  to tell to a trifle, at the first contact, of what the stone is  composed, and in which class it should be placed, by the mere \"feel\" of  the scratch, the depth of it, the amount and kind of powder it leaves,  and above all, by the sound made, which, even in the tiniest scratch, is  quite characteristic.          CHAPTER VIII.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      F--SPECIFIC GRAVITY.    The fixing of the specific gravity of a stone also determines its group  position with regard to weight; its colour and other characteristics  defining the actual stone. This is a safe and very common method of  proving a stone, since its specific gravity does not vary more than a  point or so in different specimens of the same stone. There are several  ways of arriving at this, such as by weighing in balances in the usual  manner, by displacement, and by immersion in liquids the specific  gravity of which are known. Cork is of less specific gravity than water,  therefore it floats on the surface of that liquid, whereas iron, being  heavier, sinks. So that by changing the liquid to one lighter than cork,  the cork will sink in it as does iron in water; in the second instance,  if we change the liquid to one heavier than iron, the iron will float on  it as does cork on water, and exactly as an ordinary flat-iron will  float on quicksilver, bobbing up and down like a cork in a tumbler of  water. If, therefore, solutions of known but varying densities are  compounded, it is possible to tell almost to exactitude the specific  gravity of any stone dropped into them, by the position they assume.  Thus, if we take a solution of pure methylene iodide, which has a  specific gravity of 3.2981, and into this drop a few stones selected  indiscriminately, the effect will be curious: first, some will sink  plump to the bottom like lead; second, some will fall so far quickly,  then remain for a considerable time fairly stationary; third, some will  sink very slowly; fourth, some will be partially immersed, that is, a  portion of their substance being above the surface of the liquid and a  portion covered by it; fifth, some will float on the surface without any  apparent immersion. In the first case, the stones will be much heavier  than 3.2981; in the second, the stones will be about 3.50; in the third  and fourth instances, the stones will be about the same specific gravity  as the liquid, whilst in the fifth, they will be much lighter, and thus  a rough but tolerably accurate isolation may be made.    On certain stones being extracted and placed in other liquids of lighter  or denser specific gravity, as the case may be, their proper  classification may easily be arrived at, and if the results are checked  by actual weight, in a specific gravity balance, they will be found to  be fairly accurate. The solution commonly used for the heaviest stones  is a mixture of nitrate of thallium and nitrate of silver. This double  nitrate has a specific gravity of 4.7963, therefore such a stone as  zircon, which is the heaviest known, will float in it. For use, the  mixture should be slightly warmed till it runs thin and clear; this is  necessary, because at 60 deg. (taking this as ordinary atmospheric  temperature) it is a stiff mass. A lighter liquid is a mixture of iodide  of mercury in iodide of potassium, but this is such an extremely  corrosive and dangerous mixture, that the more common solution is one  in which methylene iodide is saturated with a mixture of iodoform until  it shows a specific gravity of 3.601; and by using the methylene iodide  alone, in its pure state, it having a specific gravity of 3.2981, the  stones to that weight can be isolated, and by diluting this with  benzole, its weight can be brought down to that of the benzole itself,  as in the case of Sonstadt's solution. This solution, in full standard  strength, has a specific gravity of 3.1789, but may be weakened by the  addition of distilled water in varying proportions till the weight  becomes almost that of water.    Knowing the specific gravity of all stones, and dividing them into six  groups, by taking a series of standard solutions selected from one or  other of the above, and of known specific gravity, we can judge with  accuracy if any stone is what it is supposed to be, and classify it  correctly by its mere floating or sinking when placed in these liquids.  Beginning then with the pure double nitrate of silver and thallium, this  will isolate the stones of less specific gravity than 4.7963, and taking  the lighter solutions and standardising them, we may get seven solutions  which will isolate the stones as follows:--    A {shows the stones which have}  4.7963    {a specific gravity over}  B       \"        \"     \"         3.70  and under 4.7963  C       \"        \"     \"         3.50     \"   3.70  D       \"        \"     \"         3.00     \"   3.50  E       \"        \"     \"         2.50     \"   3.00  F       \"        \"     \"         2.00     \"   2.50  G       \"        \"     --         --    under 2.00    Therefore each liquid will isolate the stones in its own group by  compelling them to float on its surface; commencing with the heaviest  and giving to the groups the same letters as the liquids, it is seen  that--    _Group_ A.--Isolates gems with a specific gravity of 4.7963 and over  4.70; in this group is placed zircon, with a specific gravity of from  4.70 to 4.88.    _Group_ B.--Stones whose specific gravity lies between 3.70 and under  4.7963.

In many of these cases the specific gravity varies from .11 to .20, but  the above are the average figures obtained from a number of samples  specially and separately weighed. In some instances this difference may  cause a slight overlapping of the groups, as in group C, where the  chrysoberyl may weigh from 3.689 to 3.752, thus bringing the heavier  varieties of the stone into group B, but in all cases where overlapping  occurs, the colour, form, and the self-evident character of the stone  are in themselves sufficient for classification, the specific gravity  proving genuineness. This is especially appreciated when it is  remembered that so far science has been unable (except in very rare  instances of no importance) to manufacture any stone of the same colour  as the genuine and at the same time of the same specific gravity. Either  the colour and characteristics suffer in obtaining the required weight  or density, or if the colour and other properties of an artificial stone  are made closely to resemble the real, then the specific gravity is so  greatly different, either more or less, as at once to stamp the jewel as  false. In the very few exceptions where chemically-made gems even  approach the real in hardness, colour, specific gravity, &c., they "]]]
