Between these two systems are small, delicate  networks of vessels called capillaries, which subdivide into a veritable  lacework so as to reach the neighborhood of every element.    In health the blood passes through these capillaries with a regular  current, the red cells or corpuscles floating rapidly in the fluid in  the center of the channel, while the white or ameboid cells are  attracted to the walls of the vessels and move very slowly. The supply  of blood is regulated by the condition of repose or activity of the  tissue, and under normal conditions the outflow exactly compensates the  supply. The caliber of the blood vessels, and consequently the quantity  of blood which they carry, is governed by nerves of the sympathetic  system in a healthy body with unerring regularity, but in a diseased  organ the flow may cease or be greatly augmented. In health a tissue or  organ receives its proper quantity of blood; the nutritive elements are  extracted for the support of the tissue and for the product, which the  function of the organ forms. The force required in the achievement of  this is furnished by combustion of the hydrocarbons and oxygen brought  by the arterial blood, then by the veins this same fluid passes off,  less its oxygen, loaded with the waste products, which are the result of  the worn-out and disintegrated tissues, and of those which have  undergone combustion. The foregoing brief outline indicates the process  of nutrition of the tissues.    Hypernutrition, or excessive nutrition of a tissue, may be normal or  morbid. If the latter, the tissue becomes congested or inflamed.      CONGESTION.    Congestion is an unnatural accumulation of blood in a part. Excessive  accumulation of blood may be normal, as in blushing or in the red face  which temporarily follows a violent muscular effort, or, as in the  stomach or liver during digestion, or in the lungs after severe work,  from which, in the latter case, it is shortly relieved by a little rapid  breathing. The term congestion, however, usually indicates a morbid  condition, with more or less lasting effects. Congestion is active or  passive. The former is produced by an increased supply of blood to the  part, the latter by an obstacle preventing the escape of blood from the  tissue. In either case there is an increased supply of blood, and as a  result increased combustion and augmented nutrition.      ACTIVE CONGESTION.    Active congestion is caused by--    (1) _Functional activity._--Any organ which is constantly or excessively  used is habituated to hold an unusual quantity of blood; the vessels  become dilated; if overstrained the walls become weakened, lose their  elasticity, and any sudden additional quantity of blood engorges the  tissues so that they can not contract, and congestion results. Example:  The lungs of a race horse, after an unusual burst of speed or severe  work, in damp weather.    (2) _Irritants._--Heat and cold, chemical or mechanical. Any of these,  by threatening the vitality of a tissue, induce immediately an augmented  flow of blood to the part to furnish the means of repair--a hot iron,  frostbites, acids, or a blow.    (3) _Nerve influence._--This may produce congestion either by acting on  the part reflexly or as the result of some central nerve disturbance  affecting the branch which supplies a given organ.    (4) _Plethora and sanguinary temperament._--Full-blooded animals are  much more predisposed to congestive diseases than those of a lymphatic  character or those in an anemic condition. The circulation in them is  forced to all parts with much greater force and in large quantities. A  well-bred, full-blooded horse is much more subject to congestive  diseases than a common, coarse, or old, worn-out animal.    (5) _Fevers._--In fever the heart works more actively and forces the  current of blood more rapidly; the tissues are weakened, and it requires  but a slight local cause at any part to congest the structures already  overloaded with blood. Again, in certain fevers, we find alteration of  the blood itself, rendering it less or more fluid, which interferes with  its free passage through the vessels and induces a local predisposition  to congestion.    (6) _Warm climate and summer heat._--Warmth of the atmosphere relaxes  the tissues; it demands of the animals less blood to keep up their own  body temperature, and the extra quantity accumulates in the blood-vessel  system. It causes sluggishness in the performance of the organic  functions, and in this way it induces congestion, especially of the  internal organs. So we find founders, congestive colics, and staggers  more frequent in summer than in winter.    (7) _Previous congestion._--Whether the previous congestion of any organ  has been a continuous normal one--that is, a repeated functional  activity--or has been a morbid temporary overloading, it always leaves  the walls of the vessels weakened and more predisposed to recurrent  attacks from accidental causes than are perfectly healthy tissues. Thus  a horse which has had a congestion of the lungs from a severe drive is  liable to have another attack from even a lesser cause.    The alterations of congestion are distention of the blood vessels,  accumulation of the cellular elements of the blood in them, and effusion  of a portion of the liquid of the blood into the fibrous tissues which  surround the vessels. When the changes produced by congestion are  visible, as in the eye, the nostril, the mouth, the genital organs, and  on the surface of the body in white or unpigmented animals, the part  appears red from the increase of blood; it becomes swollen from the  effusion of liquid into the spongelike connective tissues; it is at  times more or less hot from the increased combustion; the part is  frequently painful to the animal from pressure of the effusion on the  nerves, and the function of the tissue is interfered with. The secretion  or excretion of glands may be augmented or diminished. Muscles may be  affected with spasms or may be unable to contract. The eyes and ears may  be affected with imaginary sights and sounds.      PASSIVE CONGESTION.    Passive congestion is caused by interference with the return of the  current of blood from a part.    Old age and debility weaken the tissues and the force of the  circulation, especially in the veins, and retard the movement of the  blood. We then see horses of this class with stocked legs, swelling of  the sheath of the penis or of the milk glands, and of the under surface  of the belly. We find them also with effusions of the liquid parts of  the blood into the lymph spaces of the posterior extremities and organs  of the pelvic cavity.    Tumors or other mechanical obstructions, by pressing on the veins,  retard the flow of blood and cause it to back up in distal parts of the  body causing passive congestion.    The alterations of passive congestion, as in active congestion, consist  of an increased quantity of blood in the vessels and an exudation of  its fluid into the tissues surrounding them, but in passive congestion  we have a dark, thick blood which has lost its oxygen, instead of the  rich, combustible blood rich in oxygen which is found in active  congestion.    The termination of congestion is by resolution or inflammation. In the  first case, the choked-up blood vessels find an outlet for the excessive  quantity of blood and are relieved; the transuded serum or fluid of the  blood is reabsorbed, and the part returns almost to its normal  condition, with, however, a tendency to weakness predisposing to future  trouble of the same kind. In the other case further alterations take  place, and we have inflammation.      INFLAMMATION.    (Plates I and II.)    Inflammation is a hypernutrition of a tissue. It is described by Dr.  Agnew, the surgeon, as \"a double-edged sword, cutting either way for  good or for evil.\" The increased nutrition may be moderate and cause a  growth of new tissue, a simple increase of quantity at first; or it may  produce a new growth differing in quality; or it may be so great that,  like luxuriant, overgrown weeds, the elements die from their very haste  of growth, and we have immediate destruction of the part. According to  the rapidity and intensity of the process of structural changes which  takes place in an inflamed tissue, inflammation is described as acute or  chronic, with a vast number of intermediate forms. When the phenomena  are marked it is termed sthenic; when less distinct, as the result of a  broken-down and feeble constitution in the animal, it is called  asthenic. Certain inflammations are specific, as in strangles, the  horsepox, glanders, etc., where a characteristic or specific cause or  condition is added to the origin, character of phenomena, or alterations  which result from an ordinary inflammation. An inflammation may be  circumscribed or limited, as in the abscess on the neck caused by the  pressure of a collar, in pneumonia, in glanders, in the small tumors of  a splint or a jack; or it may be diffuse, as in severe fistulas of the  withers, in an extensive lung fever, in the legs in a case of grease, or  in the spavins which affect horses with poorly nourished bones. The  causes of inflammation are practically the same as those of congestion,  which is the initial step of all inflammation.    The temperament of a horse predisposes the animal to inflammation of  certain organs. A full-blooded animal, whose veins show on the surface  of the body, and which has a strong, bounding heart pumping large  quantities of blood into the vascular organs like the lungs, the  intestines, and the laminae of the feet, is more liable to have  pneumonia, congestive colics, and founder, than lymphatic, cold-blooded  animals which have pleurisies, inflammation of the bones, spavins,  ringbones, inflammation of the glands of the less vascular skin of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23434"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Insects (#8)"],[1,"feed on  foliage they can be very quickly destroyed by dusting or spraying the  plants with a poison such as Paris green or arsenate of lead. The  patches of yellow or reddish eggs are found mostly on the under side of  the potato leaves. When the fat grubs are full-fed they go into the  ground and change to pupae and later to the striped beetles. This pest  should not be mistaken for the so-called old-fashioned potato beetles  which are long and slender and either bluish grey in color or striped  with yellow and black. These are blister beetles and are entirely  different.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDIES    Watch for the first appearance of the adult beetles in the spring when  the potatoes are just beginning to come up. They pass the winter under  ground and in the spring come out ready to lay eggs on the young  potatoes. Collect and examine the adults. How many stripes have they?  Collect packets of eggs and count them. How many eggs in most packets?  How are they attached to the leaf? How large are the grubs when they  hatch from the egg? Examine the grubs where they are feeding on  potatoes. Do they eat holes through the leaf, or do they eat away the  entire leaf? How fast do they grow? Collect a few in a glass tumbler.  Feed them and watch them grow. What do they do when you touch them? What  does the hard backed beetle do when it is touched? Collect some of the  large grubs with tightly stuffed bodies and put them in a jar with dirt  or sand and see where they go. After a week dig them out and see what  they look like.    [Illustration: The Colorado potato beetle showing stages of development  and work on a potato plant. Note the small patch of eggs and different  sized grub on the plant and the grub, pupa and adult at side.]    Write a short description of the eggs, grubs and beetle, its work and  means of killing it when it is feeding on potatoes. Make careful  drawings of a cluster of eggs, the grub and the beetle.          CHAPTER XII    THE LADY-BEETLE        \"_Hurt no living thing:      Ladybird, nor butterfly,      Nor moth with dusty wing,      Nor cricket chirping cheerily,      Nor grasshopper so light of leap,      Nor dancing gnat, nor beetle fat,      Nor harmless worms that creep._\"                                            --CHRISTINA ROSSETTI.      The lady-beetles comprise one family of small beetles, which is famous  for the number of beneficial forms it includes. With but two exceptions  the American forms feed upon other insects, in most cases pests such as  plant-lice and scale insects. From the time they hatch from the egg  until they pupate and again after the beetle stage is reached they are  regular tigers after plant-lice. They catch and hold their prey between  the front feet while they devour it bodily. The larva of the lady-beetle  has an astonishing capacity for in one day it will eat several times its  own weight of plant-lice. Farmers and fruit growers could hardly get  along without the help of these small beetles and yet unfortunately  thousands are often destroyed by those who do not know of their  beneficial work.    [Illustration: The spotted lady-beetle; a, larva; b, pupa; c, adult;  enlarged. (After Chittenden, U. S. Dept. Agri.)]    The lady-beetles, or lady-birds as they are often called, are fairly  uniform in shape and color. They are oval or round in outline with the  back rounded or elevated and the underside flat. In color they are  usually either orange or yellow, checkered or blotched with black or  black with yellow or bright orange markings. They closely resemble small  tortoises. Unfortunately several plant feeding beetles are similar in  shape and color which casts reflections on the lady-beetles.    [Illustration: The convergent lady-beetle; a, adult; b, pupa; c, larva;  all enlarged. (After Chittenden, U. S. Dept. Agri.)]    The grub of the lady-beetle is usually black or dull colored with red or  yellow markings which make it very conspicuous. It runs about over  foliage and is broad in front and tapers to a point behind. When the  grub is full fed it attaches the top of its body to a leaf, twig or  other object and pupates. In the pupal stage it is often protected with  spines and is able to lift the front end of the body up and down when  disturbed, producing a light tapping sound.    The lady-beetle usually hides in rubbish about the base of trees or in  some cases even enter homes for the winter months, coming out with the  spring to deposit small masses of oval yellow or orange eggs on plants  infested with lice. They breed rapidly and with the help of parasites  and other beneficial insects usually control the plant-lice pests.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDIES    Examine about fruit trees, shade trees, truck crops and in wheat fields  for the brightly marked beetles. Watch them move about the plant in  search of food. Can they fly? Do you find them eating the leaves? Do you  find any green lice near them? See if they feed on these lice. Examine  also for the soft bodied, tiger-like grubs. Do they eat the lice? Do  they travel fast? Have they wings? See if you can find any of the pupae  attached to limbs or twigs and if so, tickle them with a straw or a  pencil and see them \"bow.\" Keep a record of the different trees and  plants on which you find lady-beetles.    Collect several of the beetles and the grubs and keep them in a bottle  or jelly glass. Leave them without food for a day and then give them  some green plant-lice and watch them devour the lice. How many lice can  one eat in a day? How do they go about devouring a louse? Do they simply  suck out the blood, or is the louse completely devoured? Supposing that  for each apple tree in Missouri there are one hundred lady-beetles and  that each beetle devours fifteen lice in a day, does it not seem worth  while protecting them and encouraging such work? A little time spent in  acquainting one's self with the good work of such forms as these will  help greatly in the fight on our insect foes. Make drawings of and  describe briefly the different stages of the lady-beetles.          CHAPTER XIII    THE DRAGON-FLY      What child is there that is not familiar with the insect commonly known  as the dragon-fly, snake doctor or snake feeder? Every lover of the  stream or pond has seen these miniature aeroplanes darting now here, now  there but ever retracing their airy flight along the water's edge or  dipping in a sudden nose dive to skim its very surface. At times it is  seen to rest lazily, wings out-stretched, perched on some projecting  reed or other object. But when approached how suddenly it \"takes off\"  and is out of reach. The dragon-fly is an almost perfect model of the  modern monoplane. Its two long wings on either side are the planes, its  head the nose, its thorax the fuselage and its long projecting abdomen  the tail or rudder. On wing the dragon-fly is one of the swiftest and  most powerful insects. The dragon-flies are found all over the world  being most abundant in the warmer regions where rainfall and bodies of  water are abundant. For breeding they require water, their immature  stages living under water feeding on aquatic animal life. Our present  order of dragon-flies is the remains of an ancient race of insects of  immense size. From fossil remains we learn that ancient dragon-flies  had a wing expanse of three feet.    [Illustration: Cast off skin of dragon-fly nymph, showing shape and  position taken on a twig when the adult winged form emerged from the  last nymph stage.]    The dragon-fly is a beneficial insect thruout life. The young feed on  mosquito wigglers and similar life in ponds and streams while the adults  dart here and there over ponds, fields or lawn catching mosquitoes and  other winged insects. Many look upon the dragon-fly as a dangerous  stinging insect but it is entirely harmless and can be handled without  the least danger. They vary greatly in size and appearance. The  so-called damsel-flies form a group of dragon-flies or Odonata which  rest with the wings in a vertical position and the young aquatic stages  are more slender. In color markings dragon-flies include all hues of the  rainbow tho as a rule they do not have such extravagant colors as the  butterflies.    [Illustration: One of our common dragon-flies found about ponds and  streams.]      OBSERVATIONS AND FIELD STUDIES    Go into the fields and study and collect the different kinds of  dragon-flies and their young stages from the bottoms of ponds. How  swiftly can they fly? Do they fly high in the air as well as near the  water or surface of the earth? Can you see them catch other insects? Do  birds catch them and eat them? Take a position along the edge of a pond  and as they come flying by swing swiftly with your net and catch one.  Examine it carefully. Note the strength of the long, slender wings with  their lace-like network of veins. Measure the distance across the back  from tip to tip of wings. Compare this with the length from tip of head  to the tip of the abdomen. Examine the head with its large compound eyes  and the chewing mouth parts. Note the strong thorax which is filled with  muscles to operate the wings in flight. How many segments are there to  the abdomen?    With the hands or with a bucket dip up a quantity of mud and trash from  the bottom of a pond and pile it on the bank. As the water soaks away  watch for signs of life in the mass. If you find a few small creatures,  say half an inch long with large head and eyes, broad body and with six  rather long legs they are probably the nymph stages of dragon-flies.  Wash the mud off of them so that you can examine them carefully. With a  straw probe in the mouth and you will find that the lower lip is a long  elbowed structure which can be suddenly thrown out in front of it and  with a pair of pincher-like prongs at the tip it can catch and hold its  prey. Some forms keep their bodies covered with mud so that they can"]]]
