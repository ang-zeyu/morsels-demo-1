In these we practise likewise all conclusions of grafting, and  inoculating as well of wild-trees as fruit-trees, which produceth many  effects.  And we make (by art) in the same orchards and gardens, trees  and flowers to come earlier or later than their seasons; and to come up  and bear more speedily than by their natural course they do. We make  them also by art greater much than their nature; and their fruit  greater and sweeter and of differing taste, smell, colour, and figure,  from their nature.  And many of them we so order, as they become of  medicinal use.    \"We have also means to make divers plants rise by mixtures of earths  without seeds; and likewise to make divers new plants, differing from  the vulgar; and to make one tree or plant turn into another.    \"We have also parks and enclosures of all sorts of beasts and birds  which we use not only for view or rareness, but likewise for  dissections and trials; that thereby we may take light what may be  wrought upon the body of man.  Wherein we find many strange effects; as  continuing life in them, though divers parts, which you account vital,  be perished and taken forth; resuscitating of some that seem dead in  appearance; and the like.  We try also all poisons and other medicines  upon them, as well of chirurgery, as physic.  By art likewise, we make  them greater or taller than their kind is; and contrariwise dwarf them,  and stay their growth: we make them more fruitful and bearing than  their kind is; and contrariwise barren and not generative.  Also we  make them differ in colour, shape, activity, many ways.  We find means  to make commixtures and copulations of different kinds; which have  produced many new kinds, and them not barren, as the general opinion  is.  We make a number of kinds of serpents, worms, flies, fishes, of  putrefaction; whereof some are advanced (in effect) to be perfect  creatures, like bests or birds; and have sexes, and do propagate.  Neither do we this by chance, but we know beforehand, of what matter  and commixture what kind of those creatures will arise.    \"We have also particular pools, where we make trials upon fishes, as we  have said before of beasts and birds.    \"We have also places for breed and generation of those kinds of worms  and flies which are of special use; such as are with you your  silk-worms and bees.    \"I will not hold you long with recounting of our brewhouses,  bake-houses, and kitchens, where are made divers drinks, breads, and  meats, rare and of special effects.  Wines we have of grapes; and  drinks of other juice of fruits, of grains, and of roots; and of  mixtures with honey, sugar, manna, and fruits dried, and decocted; Also  of the tears or woundings of trees; and of the pulp of canes. And these  drinks are of several ages, some to the age or last of forty years.  We  have drinks also brewed with several herbs, and roots, and spices; yea  with several fleshes, and white-meats; whereof some of the drinks are  such, as they are in effect meat and drink both: so that divers,  especially in age, do desire to live with them, with little or no meat  or bread.  And above all, we strive to have drink of extreme thin  parts, to insinuate into the body, and yet without all biting,  sharpness, or fretting; insomuch as some of them put upon the back of  your hand will, with a little stay, pass through to the palm, and yet  taste mild to the mouth.  We have also waters which we ripen in that  fashion, as they become nourishing; so that they are indeed excellent  drink; and many will use no other.  Breads we have of several grains,  roots, and kernels; yea and some of flesh and fish dried; with divers  kinds of leavenings and seasonings: so that some do extremely move  appetites; some do nourish so, as divers do live of them, without any  other meat; who live very long.  So for meats, we have some of them so  beaten and made tender and mortified,' yet without all corrupting, as a  weak heat of the stomach will turn them into good chylus; as well as a  strong heat would meat otherwise prepared.  We have some meats also and  breads and drinks, which taken by men enable them to fast long after;  and some other, that used make the very flesh of men's bodies sensibly'  more hard and tough and their strength far greater than otherwise it  would be.    \"We have dispensatories, or shops of medicines.  Wherein you may easily  think, if we have such variety of plants and living creatures more than  you have in Europe, (for we know what you have,) the simples, drugs,  and ingredients of medicines, must likewise be in so much the greater  variety.  We have them likewise of divers ages, and long fermentations.  And for their preparations, we have not only all manner of exquisite  distillations and separations, and especially by gentle heats and  percolations through divers strainers, yea and substances; but also  exact forms of composition, whereby they incorporate almost, as they  were natural simples.    \"We have also divers mechanical arts, which you have not; and stuffs  made by them; as papers, linen, silks, tissues; dainty works of  feathers of wonderful lustre; excellent dies, and, many others; and  shops likewise, as well for such as are not brought into vulgar use  amongst us as for those that are.  For you must know that of the things  before recited, many of them are grown into use throughout the kingdom;  but yet, if they did flow from our invention, we have of them also for  patterns and principals.    \"We have also furnaces of great diversities, and that keep great  diversity of heats; fierce and quick; strong and constant; soft and  mild; blown, quiet; dry, moist; and the like.  But above all, we have  heats, in imitation of the Sun's and heavenly bodies' heats, that pass  divers inequalities, and (as it were) orbs, progresses, and returns,  whereby we produce admirable effects.  Besides, we have heats of dungs;  and of bellies and maws of living creatures, and of their bloods and  bodies; and of hays and herbs laid up moist; of lime unquenched; and  such like.  Instruments also which generate heat only by motion.  And  farther, places for strong insulations; and again, places under the  earth, which by nature, or art, yield heat.  These divers heats we use,  as the nature of the operation, which we intend, requireth.    \"We have also perspective-houses, where we make demonstrations of all  lights and radiations; and of all colours: and out of things uncoloured  and transparent, we can represent unto you all several colours; not in  rain-bows, (as it is in gems, and prisms,) but of themselves single.  We represent also all multiplications of light, which we carry to great  distance, and make so sharp as to discern small points and lines.  Also  all colourations of light; all delusions and deceits of the sight, in  figures, magnitudes, motions, colours all demonstrations of shadows.  We find also divers means, yet unknown to you, of producing of light  originally from divers bodies.  We procure means of seeing objects afar  off; as in the heaven and remote places; and represent things near as  afar off; and things afar off as near; making feigned distances.  We  have also helps for the sight, far above spectacles and glasses in use.  We have also glasses and means to see small and minute bodies perfectly  and distinctly; as the shapes and colours of small flies and worms,  grains and flaws in gems, which cannot otherwise be seen, observations  in urine and blood not otherwise to be seen.  We make artificial  rain-bows, halo's, and circles about light.  We represent also all  manner of reflexions, refractions, and multiplications of visual beams  of objects.    \"We have also precious stones of all kinds, many of them of great  beauty, and to you unknown; crystals likewise; and glasses of divers  kinds; and amongst them some of metals vitrificated, and other  materials besides those of which you make glass.  Also a number of  fossils, and imperfect minerals, which you have not.  Likewise  loadstones of prodigious virtue; and other rare stones, both natural  and artificial.    \"We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all  sounds, and their generation.  We have harmonies which you have not, of  quarter-sounds, and lesser slides of sounds.  Divers instruments of  music likewise to you unknown, some sweeter than any you have, together  with bells and rings that are dainty and sweet.  We represent small  sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds extenuate and sharp; we  make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in their original  are entire.  We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and  letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds.  We have certain  helps which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also  divers strange and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24384"],[0,"365 Luncheon Dishes: A Luncheon Dish for Every Day in the Year (#8)"],[1," cupful of milk,  and boil; sprinkle in 2 ozs. of grated Parmesan cheese, cayenne and salt  to taste.
