I cannot tell you how much confidence the prayer of that dear child gave  me; I am sure--I was then sure--that God hears such prayers.  The rest  of the family too had been praying; they were not prayers forced out by  fear, but just such trusting, hopeful prayers as God loves to honour.  I  stood for a few moments till Susan ceased, and when she did, I uttered a  low \"Amen.\"  The dear ones heard me, and looked up, but did not rise  from their knees; indeed, the vessel was tumbling about so much, that it  was with difficulty they could hold on.  I told them what I was come  down for, and striking a light, I took down my chart from the beckets in  which it hung, and spread it out on the table.  I anxiously marked down  the position in which, by my calculations, I believed the schooner then  was.  A league or more to the eastward there was, I found, an island  with a bay inside it, affording anchorage for small vessels.  For a  large ship it would have been utterly useless.  Here, again, was an  advantage which my humble little schooner possessed over a bigger craft.  Giving a parting kiss to my wife and daughters, I leaped again on deck.    It was a question whether we should be able to keep off the shore till  we could reach the island.  I could see the surf breaking furiously on  the rocks to leeward, and the gale blew as heavily as ever.  A slight  shift of wind might save us.  If the wind held as it then did, I had no  hopes for the little _May Flower_.    The day was drawing to a close.  Every instant the danger increased.  The gale, instead of breaking, raged more furiously than ever.  Closer  and closer the schooner drifted towards the shore.  It would have been  madness to carry more sail; for already her lee bulwarks were under  water, and yet I dared not take any off her with the slightest hopes of  being able to claw off shore.  The seas came breaking on board, deluging  our decks, and, had not the hatches been firmly secured, would quickly  have swamped us.  I was at the helm, with Charley White by my side, my  boys and the two men having lashed themselves to the weather rigging.  No one appeared to be terror-stricken, and yet the youngest, as well as  old Bob Hunt, knew perfectly well that there was every probability of  our being in a few short minutes overwhelmed among the foaming breakers  under our lee.  Anxiously I looked out for the island; and the wind blew  fiercer and fiercer.    Suddenly there was a lull; but it was of no advantage to us, as the huge  rollers were literally throwing us rapidly towards the rocks.  Again the  gale came down on us, but its direction was altered.  It blew nearer  from the westward, by several points, than it had before done.  Already  the schooner was heading off from the shore, but very slowly; and I was  doubtful how far she would make way against the rollers, which sent her  bodily back towards it.  Still there was hope, and I could venture to  slide back the hatch and to sing out to the dear ones below that the  wind had changed.  \"Thank God for His mercy,\" was the reply from below,  for I had speedily to shut the hatch again.  Just afterwards I saw an  opening in the land to the westward, and I knew that it must be the  passage between the island and the main.  There was a hillock and a  peculiar rock, which prevented me from having any doubt about the  matter.  What a comfort to feel sure that we were steering a right  course for a safe harbour!  I could now venture to keep away again a  little.    The entrance to the sound became more and more distinct as we advanced.  The various landmarks noted in the chart, appeared one after the other,  and in half an hour we ran into a beautiful little harbour, with the  water as smooth as a mill-pond.  Our first care, directly the anchor was  dropped, was to take off the hatches and give air to our poor sheep.  The boys jumped below to ascertain if they had suffered.    \"All the animals are alive,\" they cried out; \"but send us down a bucket  of water.\"  The creatures sucked it up quickly.  They probably would not  have held out many hours longer; but we lifted them up, two at a time,  on deck, and the fresh air soon revived them.  We had only just light  enough to see our way into the harbour, but we hoped in the morning to  get on shore and to cut some grass, which would do them more good than  the fresh air.    I should have said that directly we were in smooth water my wife and  daughters came on deck, and, as they gazed on the sheltering shore under  which we were running, they lifted up their hands in earnest  thankfulness to that merciful God who had brought us into a haven of  rest.    On sounding the well, we found that, notwithstanding all the tossing we  had gone through, the stout little craft had not made a drop of water.  We spent two very busy days in Refuge harbour, cutting grass and wood,  and filling up our water casks.  All this time no natives were seen.  There are indeed but few on that part of the coast.  Short-sighted  mortals that we are--we had been inclined to complain of our detention,  but we had reason to be thankful that we had gone into Refuge harbour.    As soon as we had filled up with wood and water, we got under weigh, and  stood out through the eastern end of the sound.  Before, however, we had  got from under the shelter of the island--a long, low sandy point  intervening between us and the ocean--we saw to the southward a dark  bank of clouds coming, like an army in close rank, rapidly up towards  us.    The breeze was light, and the sea comparatively calm, but underneath the  cloud there came a line of white foam, beyond which the whole ocean  seemed a mass of tossing seas.  I knew what to expect, and, going about,  stood back to our snug little bay.  Scarcely had we dropped our anchor  and furled sails than the hurricane burst above the island, and we could  see the breakers dashing furiously on the opposite shore.  For nearly  three days the tempest--one of the most violent ever known on that  coast--continued raging.  Many a big ship went down, and many a stout  one was cast upon the rooks and dashed to pieces.    We waited--grateful for our escape--till the wind moderated and the sea  went down, and then once again sailed for our final destination.  In our  small vessel we had to economise fresh water, fodder for the animals,  and fuel; and it was very important that we should have a quick passage.  We had, therefore, again filled up with those necessary articles, and  in every corner we had stowed away all the fresh grass we could cut.  This, mixed with the hay, kept the sheep in excellent condition.  We had  ere long to be thankful that we had not neglected to prepare for all  contingencies.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    FRESH WATER.    We had for some time very fine weather, which confirmed Bob Hunt in his  opinion that the cat, Duchess, was as wise as he had at first believed.    \"She knowed it,\" he observed, looking sagaciously at Dick Nailor, who  was sitting on the capstan with his arms folded across his broad chest,  looking out ahead, \"she knowed it, and she'll stick by this craft till  we get safe into Port Jackson, you'll see that.\"    \"As to that, I see that the cat is there, and that our little craft is  afloat, and every prospect of remaining so!\" answered Dick.  It was  seldom he uttered so long an expression.  \"You don't even say that the  cat has had any hand in keeping her afloat; and to my mind, it's just  this: she found the craft tight and wholesome, she was fond of us, and  she saw that we didn't leave her, and so she didn't.  No, no, Bob, the  old Duchess had nothing to do with the matter.  There's one aloft who  took care of us, and if the cat had fallen overboard, or gone ashore and  been left behind, it would have made no manner of difference.\"    \"Then, I suppose you mean to say that there is no such person as the  Flying Dutchman?\" observed Bob; \"everybody who has rounded the Cape has  heard of him.\"    \"There might have been some villain of a Dutchman who swore that he'd  beat about the seas till the Day of Judgment; but depend on it, if he  ever did utter such an oath, he's gone to answer for it long ago--far  away from this world,\" said Dick Nailor, solemnly.  \"I've heard many,  many men talk of the Flying Dutchman, but I never yet met with one who  had seen him.\"    Neither had Bob Hunt, and so he had nothing to answer to this--indeed,  talkative as he was, he always had to knock under to Dick's sturdy,  matter-of-fact arguments, or to his pertinacious silence, if no argument  was forthcoming.    The quaint fellow would fold his arms, sit down, and look a picture of  stolidity.    I have not said much about how my children passed their time during the  voyage.  The boys were generally employed in sailing the vessel, or  about the rigging; for my object was not only to keep the vessel in good  order during the voyage, but to take her into Port Jackson looking as  fresh as I could.  However, the boys had time to practice writing and to  study their books, and both Peter and Charles White were able to help  them.  The girls had plenty of work to do, as my wife had laid in a  store of all sorts of things to make up.  They also were not idle with  regard to their books; and they had several pleasant ones to read.  I  found also that Charley White was very happy to help them forward in  their studies, and Susan took it into her head that she should very much  like to learn navigation.  She, however, gave up that idea, and took to  singing, as Charley, who knew something about music, thought he could  help her, and it was likely to prove a more amusing study, and quite as  useful to her.  I may safely say that no one was idle on board; and what  is more, that not a real quarrel, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#8)"],[1,"eeze--huckychow!    \"'Aha!' sez Brer Fox, sezee; 'you er dar, is you?' sezee.

WOLF MAKES A FAILURE    \"I LAY yo' ma got comp'ny,\" said Uncle Remus, as the little boy  entered the old man's door with a huge piece of mince-pie in his  hand, 'en ef she ain't got comp'ny, den she done gone en drap de  cubberd key som'ers whar you done run up wid it.\"    \"Well, I saw the pie lying there, Uncle Remus, and I just thought  I'd fetch it out to you.\"    \"Tooby sho, honey,\" replied the old man, regarding the child with  admiration. \"Tooby sho, honey; dat changes marters.

Then he wiped the crumbs  from his beard and began:    \"Brer Fox feel so bad, en he git so mad 'bout Brer Rabbit, dat he  dunner w'at ter do, en he look mighty down-hearted. Bimeby, one  day wiles he wuz gwine 'long de road, old Brer Wolf come up wid  'im.

FOX TACKLES OLD MAN TARRYPIN    \"ONE day,\" said Uncle Remus, sharpening his knife on the palm  of his hand--\"one day Brer Fox strike up wid Brer Tarrypin right  in de middle er de big road.

It was so peculiar, indeed,  that the little boy asked:    \"How did he go to the bottom, Uncle Remus?\"    \"Kerblunkity-blink!\"    \"Was he drowned, Uncle Remus?\"    \"Who? Ole man Tarrypin? Is you drowndid w'en yo' ma tucks you  in de bed?\"    \"Well, no,\" replied the little boy, dubiously.    \"Ole man Tarrypin 'wuz at home I tell you, honey. Kerblinkity-  blunk!\"      XIII.
