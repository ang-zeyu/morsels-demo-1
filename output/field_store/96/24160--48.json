He  had underestimated the effect of his words. Lord Warburton, who appeared  constantly desirous of a nearer view of Miss Archer, strolled toward the  two cousins at the moment, and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on  him.    \"Oh no; she has not adopted me. I'm not a candidate for adoption.\"    \"I beg a thousand pardons,\" Ralph murmured. \"I meant--I meant--\" He  hardly knew what he meant.    \"You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up.  She has been very kind to me; but,\" she added with a certain visible  eagerness of desire to be explicit, \"I'm very fond of my liberty.\"    \"Are you talking about Mrs. Touchett?\" the old man called out from his  chair. \"Come here, my dear, and tell me about her. I'm always thankful  for information.\"    The girl hesitated again, smiling. \"She's really very benevolent,\"  she answered; after which she went over to her uncle, whose mirth was  excited by her words.    Lord Warburton was left standing with Ralph Touchett, to whom in a  moment he said: \"You wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting  woman. There it is!\"        CHAPTER III    Mrs. Touchett was certainly a person of many oddities, of which her  behaviour on returning to her husband's house after many months was a  noticeable specimen. She had her own way of doing all that she did, and  this is the simplest description of a character which, although by no  means without liberal motions, rarely succeeded in giving an impression  of suavity. Mrs. Touchett might do a great deal of good, but she  never pleased. This way of her own, of which she was so fond, was not  intrinsically offensive--it was just unmistakeably distinguished from  the ways of others. The edges of her conduct were so very clear-cut that  for susceptible persons it sometimes had a knife-like effect. That hard  fineness came out in her deportment during the first hours of her return  from America, under circumstances in which it might have seemed that  her first act would have been to exchange greetings with her husband  and son. Mrs. Touchett, for reasons which she deemed excellent, always  retired on such occasions into impenetrable seclusion, postponing the  more sentimental ceremony until she had repaired the disorder of dress  with a completeness which had the less reason to be of high importance  as neither beauty nor vanity were concerned in it. She was a plain-faced  old woman, without graces and without any great elegance, but with an  extreme respect for her own motives. She was usually prepared to explain  these--when the explanation was asked as a favour; and in such a case  they proved totally different from those that had been attributed to  her. She was virtually separated from her husband, but she appeared to  perceive nothing irregular in the situation. It had become clear, at an  early stage of their community, that they should never desire the same  thing at the same moment, and this appearance had prompted her to rescue  disagreement from the vulgar realm of accident. She did what she could  to erect it into a law--a much more edifying aspect of it--by going to  live in Florence, where she bought a house and established herself; and  by leaving her husband to take care of the English branch of his bank.  This arrangement greatly pleased her; it was so felicitously definite.  It struck her husband in the same light, in a foggy square in London,  where it was at times the most definite fact he discerned; but he  would have preferred that such unnatural things should have a greater  vagueness. To agree to disagree had cost him an effort; he was ready to  agree to almost anything but that, and saw no reason why either assent  or dissent should be so terribly consistent. Mrs. Touchett indulged in  no regrets nor speculations, and usually came once a year to spend a  month with her husband, a period during which she apparently took pains  to convince him that she had adopted the right system. She was not fond  of the English style of life, and had three or four reasons for it to  which she currently alluded; they bore upon minor points of that ancient  order, but for Mrs. Touchett they amply justified non-residence. She  detested bread-sauce, which, as she said, looked like a poultice  and tasted like soap; she objected to the consumption of beer by  her maid-servants; and she affirmed that the British laundress (Mrs.  Touchett was very particular about the appearance of her linen) was not  a mistress of her art. At fixed intervals she paid a visit to her own  country; but this last had been longer than any of its predecessors.    She had taken up her niece--there was little doubt of that. One wet  afternoon, some four months earlier than the occurrence lately narrated,  this young lady had been seated alone with a book. To say she was so  occupied is to say that her solitude did not press upon her; for her  love of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was  strong. There was at this time, however, a want of fresh taste in  her situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to  correct. The visitor had not been announced; the girl heard her at last  walking about the adjoining room. It was in an old house at Albany, a  large, square, double house, with a notice of sale in the windows of one  of the lower apartments. There were two entrances, one of which had  long been out of use but had never been removed. They were exactly  alike--large white doors, with an arched frame and wide side-lights,  perched upon little \"stoops\" of red stone, which descended sidewise  to the brick pavement of the street. The two houses together formed a  single dwelling, the party-wall having been removed and the rooms placed  in communication. These rooms, above-stairs, were extremely numerous,  and were painted all over exactly alike, in a yellowish white which had  grown sallow with time. On the third floor there was a sort of arched  passage, connecting the two sides of the house, which Isabel and her  sisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which, though it  was short and well lighted, always seemed to the girl to be strange and  lonely, especially on winter afternoons. She had been in the house,  at different periods, as a child; in those days her grandmother lived  there. Then there had been an absence of ten years, followed by a return  to Albany before her father's death. Her grandmother, old Mrs. Archer,  had exercised, chiefly within the limits of the family, a large  hospitality in the early period, and the little girls often spent weeks  under her roof--weeks of which Isabel had the happiest memory. The  manner of life was different from that of her own home--larger, more  plentiful, practically more festal; the discipline of the nursery was  delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation  of one's elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost  unbounded. There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother's  sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of  standing invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to  a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a  gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill.  Isabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she  thought her grandmother's home romantic. There was a covered piazza  behind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous  interest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable  and containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity. Isabel had  stayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her  visits had a flavour of peaches. On the other side, across the street,  was an old house that was called the Dutch House--a peculiar structure  dating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been  painted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers,  defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street.  It was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept  or rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel's chief  recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs  at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence.  The little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation  of knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it,  she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home,  where, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House  were open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the  multiplication table--an incident in which the elation of liberty and  the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled. The foundation  of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother's  house, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people,  she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces,  which she used to climb upon a chair to take down. When she had found  one to her taste--she was guided in the selection chiefly by the  frontispiece--she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay  beyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew  why, the office. Whose office it had been and at what period it had  flourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained  an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace  for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent  (so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims  of injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had  established relations almost human, certainly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady â€” Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"ore--even just as you are.\"    \"I appreciate that; but if you had waited a while, sooner or later  we should have been sure to meet, and our meeting would have been  pleasanter for each of us than this.\"    \"Waited till after you're married? That's just what I didn't want to do.  You'll be different then.\"    \"Not very. I shall still be a great friend of yours. You'll see.\"    \"That will make it all the worse,\" said Mr. Goodwood grimly.    \"Ah, you're unaccommodating! I can't promise to dislike you in order to  help you to resign yourself.\"    \"I shouldn't care if you did!\"    Isabel got up with a movement of repressed impatience and walked to the  window, where she remained a moment looking out. When she turned round  her visitor was still motionless in his place. She came toward him again  and stopped, resting her hand on the back of the chair she had just  quitted. \"Do you mean you came simply to look at me? That's better for  you perhaps than for me.\"    \"I wished to hear the sound of your voice,\" he said.    \"You've heard it, and you see it says nothing very sweet.\"    \"It gives me pleasure, all the same.\" And with this he got up. She had  felt pain and displeasure on receiving early that day the news he was in  Florence and by her leave would come within an hour to see her. She  had been vexed and distressed, though she had sent back word by his  messenger that he might come when he would. She had not been better  pleased when she saw him; his being there at all was so full of heavy  implications. It implied things she could never assent to--rights,  reproaches, remonstrance, rebuke, the expectation of making her change  her purpose. These things, however, if implied, had not been expressed;  and now our young lady, strangely enough, began to resent her visitor's  remarkable self-control. There was a dumb misery about him that  irritated her; there was a manly staying of his hand that made her heart  beat faster. She felt her agitation rising, and she said to herself  that she was angry in the way a woman is angry when she has been in the  wrong. She was not in the wrong; she had fortunately not that bitterness  to swallow; but, all the same, she wished he would denounce her a  little. She had wished his visit would be short; it had no purpose, no  propriety; yet now that he seemed to be turning away she felt a sudden  horror of his leaving her without uttering a word that would give her an  opportunity to defend herself more than she had done in writing to him  a month before, in a few carefully chosen words, to announce her  engagement. If she were not in the wrong, however, why should she desire  to defend herself? It was an excess of generosity on Isabel's part to  desire that Mr. Goodwood should be angry. And if he had not meanwhile  held himself hard it might have made him so to hear the tone in which  she suddenly exclaimed, as if she were accusing him of having accused  her: \"I've not deceived you! I was perfectly free!\"    \"Yes, I know that,\" said Caspar.    \"I gave you full warning that I'd do as I chose.\"    \"You said you'd probably never marry, and you said it with such a manner  that I pretty well believed it.\"    She considered this an instant. \"No one can be more surprised than  myself at my present intention.\"    \"You told me that if I heard you were engaged I was not to believe  it,\" Caspar went on. \"I heard it twenty days ago from yourself, but I  remembered what you had said. I thought there might be some mistake, and  that's partly why I came.\"    \"If you wish me to repeat it by word of mouth, that's soon done. There's  no mistake whatever.\"    \"I saw that as soon as I came into the room.\"    \"What good would it do you that I shouldn't marry?\" she asked with a  certain fierceness.    \"I should like it better than this.\"    \"You're very selfish, as I said before.\"    \"I know that. I'm selfish as iron.\"    \"Even iron sometimes melts! If you'll be reasonable I'll see you again.\"    \"Don't you call me reasonable now?\"    \"I don't know what to say to you,\" she answered with sudden humility.    \"I shan't trouble you for a long time,\" the young man went on. He made  a step towards the door, but he stopped. \"Another reason why I came was  that I wanted to hear what you would say in explanation of your having  changed your mind.\"    Her humbleness as suddenly deserted her. \"In explanation? Do you think  I'm bound to explain?\"    He gave her one of his long dumb looks. \"You were very positive. I did  believe it.\"    \"So did I. Do you think I could explain if I would?\"    \"No, I suppose not. Well,\" he added, \"I've done what I wished. I've seen  you.\"    \"How little you make of these terrible journeys,\" she felt the poverty  of her presently replying.    \"If you're afraid I'm knocked up--in any such way as that--you may be  at your ease about it.\" He turned away, this time in earnest, and no  hand-shake, no sign of parting, was exchanged between them.    At the door he stopped with his hand on the knob. \"I shall leave  Florence to-morrow,\" he said without a quaver.    \"I'm delighted to hear it!\" she answered passionately. Five minutes  after he had gone out she burst into tears.        CHAPTER XXXIII    Her fit of weeping, however, was soon smothered, and the signs of it had  vanished when, an hour later, she broke the news to her aunt. I use this  expression because she had been sure Mrs. Touchett would not be pleased;  Isabel had only waited to tell her till she had seen Mr. Goodwood. She  had an odd impression that it would not be honourable to make the fact  public before she should have heard what Mr. Goodwood would say about  it. He had said rather less than she expected, and she now had a  somewhat angry sense of having lost time. But she would lose no more;  she waited till Mrs. Touchett came into the drawing-room before the  mid-day breakfast, and then she began. \"Aunt Lydia, I've something to  tell you.\"    Mrs. Touchett gave a little jump and looked at her almost fiercely. \"You  needn't tell me; I know what it is.\"    \"I don't know how you know.\"    \"The same way that I know when the window's open--by feeling a draught.  You're going to marry that man.\"    \"What man do you mean?\" Isabel enquired with great dignity.    \"Madame Merle's friend--Mr. Osmond.\"    \"I don't know why you call him Madame Merle's friend. Is that the  principal thing he's known by?\"    \"If he's not her friend he ought to be--after what she has done for  him!\" cried Mrs. Touchett. \"I shouldn't have expected it of her; I'm  disappointed.\"    \"If you mean that Madame Merle has had anything to do with my engagement  you're greatly mistaken,\" Isabel declared with a sort of ardent  coldness.    \"You mean that your attractions were sufficient, without the gentleman's  having had to be lashed up? You're quite right. They're immense, your  attractions, and he would never have presumed to think of you if she  hadn't put him up to it. He has a very good opinion of himself, but he  was not a man to take trouble. Madame Merle took the trouble for him.\"    \"He has taken a great deal for himself!\" cried Isabel with a voluntary  laugh.    Mrs. Touchett gave a sharp nod. \"I think he must, after all, to have  made you like him so much.\"    \"I thought he even pleased YOU.\"    \"He did, at one time; and that's why I'm angry with him.\"    \"Be angry with me, not with him,\" said the girl.    \"Oh, I'm always angry with you; that's no satisfaction! Was it for this  that you refused Lord Warburton?\"    \"Please don't go back to that. Why shouldn't I like Mr. Osmond, since  others have done so?\"    \"Others, at their wildest moments, never wanted to marry him. There's  nothing OF him,\" Mrs. Touchett explained.    \"Then he can't hurt me,\" said Isabel.    \"Do you think you're going to be happy? No one's happy, in such doings,  you should know.\"    \"I shall set the fashion then. What does one marry for?\"    \"What YOU will marry for, heaven only knows. People usually marry as  they go into partnership--to set up a house. But in your partnership  you'll bring everything.\"    \"Is it that Mr. Osmond isn't rich? Is that what you're talking about?\"  Isabel asked.    \"He has no money; he has no name; he has no importance. I value such  things and I have the courage to say it; I think they're very precious.  Many other people think the same, and they show it. But they give some  other reason.\"    Isabel hesitated a little. \"I think I value everything that's valuable.  I care very much for money, and that's why I wish Mr. Osmond to have a  little.\"    \"Give it to him then; but marry some one else.\"    \"His name's good enough for me,\" the girl went on. \"It's a very pretty  name. Have I such a fine one myself?\"    \"All the more reason you should improve on it. There are only a dozen  American names. Do you marry him out of charity?\"    \"It was my duty to tell you, Aunt Lydia, but I don't think it's my duty  to explain to you. Even if it were I shouldn't be able. So please don't  remonstrate; in talking about it you have me at a disadvantage. I can't  talk about it.\"    \"I don't remonstrate, I simply answer you: I must give some sign of  intelligence. I saw it coming, and I said nothing. I never meddle.\"    \"You never do, and I'm greatly obliged to you. You've been very  considerate.\"    \"It was not considerate--it was convenient,\" said Mrs. Touchett. \"But I  shall talk to Madame Merle.\"    \"I don't see why you keep bringing her in. She has been a very good  friend to me.\"    \"Possibly; but she has been a poor one to me.\"    \"What has she done to you?\"    \"She has deceived me. She had as good as promised me to prevent your  engagement.\"    \"She couldn't have prevented it.\"    \"She can do anything; that's what I've always liked her for. I knew she  could play any part; but I understood that she played them one by one. I  didn't understand that she would play two at the same time.\"    \"I don't know what part she may have played to you,\" Isabel said;  \"that's "]]]
