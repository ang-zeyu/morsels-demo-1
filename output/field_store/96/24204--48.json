As a result the hairs which  are swallowed are carried around by the contractions of the stomach and  gradually assume the form of a small pellet or ball. This increases in size  as fresh quantities of hair are introduced into the stomach and adhere to  the surface of the ball. These balls are found most frequently in the  reticulum or second stomach (Pl. II, B), though sometimes in the rumen. In  calves hair balls are generally found in the fourth stomach. There are no  certain symptoms by which we can determine the presence of hair balls in  the stomach, and therefore no treatment can be recommended for such cases.  In making post-mortem examinations of cattle we have sometimes found the  walls of the reticulum transfixed with nails or pieces of wire, and yet the  animal had not shown any symptoms of indigestion, but had died from  maladies not involving the second stomach.      INDIGESTION (DYSPEPSIA, OR GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH).    Tympanites, already described, is a form of indigestion in which the chief  symptom and most threatening condition is the collection of gas in the  paunch. This symptom does not always accompany indigestion, so it is well  here to consider other forms under a separate head. If indigestion is long  continued, the irritant abnormal products developed cause catarrh of the  stomach and intestines--gastrointestinal catarrh. On the other hand,  however, irritant substances ingested may cause gastrointestinal catarrh,  which, in turn, will cause indigestion; hence, it results that these  several conditions are usually found existing together.    _Causes._--Irritant feed, damaged feed, overloading of the stomach, or  sudden changes of diet may cause this disease. Want of exercise predisposes  to it, or feed which is coarse and indigestible may after a time produce  it. Feed which possesses astringent properties and tends to check secretion  may also act as an exciting cause. Feed in excessive quantity may lead to  disorder of digestion and to this disease. It is very likely to appear  toward the end of protracted seasons of drought; therefore a deficiency of  water must be regarded as one of the conditions which favor its  development.    _Symptoms._--Diminished appetite, rumination irregular, tongue coated,  mouth slimy, dung passed apparently not well digested and smelling bad,  dullness, and fullness of the flanks. The disease may in some cases assume  a chronic character, and in addition to the foregoing symptoms slight  bloating or tympanites of the left flank may be observed; the animal  breathes with effort and each respiration may be accompanied with a grunt,  the ears and horns are alternately hot and cold, rumination ceases, the  usual rumbling sound in the stomach is not audible, the passage of dung is  almost entirely suspended, and the animal passes only a little mucus  occasionally. Sometimes there is alternating constipation and diarrhea.  There is low fever in many cases.    The disease continues a few days or a week in the mild cases, while the  severe cases may last several weeks. In the latter form the emaciation and  loss of strength may be very great. There is no appetite, no rumination,  nor peristalsis. The mouth is hot and sticky, the eyes have receded in  their sockets, and milk secretion has ceased. In such cases the outlook for  recovery is unfavorable. The patient falls away in flesh and becomes  weaker, as is shown by the fact that one frequently finds it lying down.    On examining animals which have died of this disease it is found that the  lining membrane of the fourth stomach and the intestines, particularly the  small intestine, is red, swollen, streaked with deeper red or bluish lines,  or spotted. The lining of the first three stomachs is more or less  softened, and may easily be peeled off. The third stomach (psalter)  contains dry feed in hard masses closely adherent to its walls.    In some cases the brain appears to become disordered, probably from the  pain and weakness and from the absorption of toxins generated in the  digestive canal. In such cases there is weakness and an unsteady gait, the  animal does not appear to take notice of and will consequently run against  obstacles; after a time it falls and gives up to violent and disordered  movements. This delirious condition is succeeded by coma or stupor, and  death ensues.    _Treatment._--Small quantities of roots, sweet silage, or selected grass or  hay should be offered several times daily. Very little feed should be  allowed. Aromatic and demulcent drafts may be given to produce a soothing  effect on the mucous lining of the stomachs and to promote digestion. Two  ounces of camomile flowers should be boiled for 20 minutes in a quart of  water and the infusion on cooling should be given to the affected animal.  This may be repeated three or four times a day. When constipation is  present the following purgative may be administered: One pound of Glauber's  salt dissolved in a quart of linseed tea and a pint of molasses. After this  purgative has acted, if there is a lack of appetite and the animal does not  ruminate regularly, the powder mentioned in remarks on the treatment of  chronic tympanites may be given according to directions. The diet must be  rather laxative and of an easily digestible character after an attack of  this form of indigestion. Feed should be given in moderate quantities, as  excess by overtaxing the digestive functions may bring on a relapse.  Ice-cold water should be avoided.      INDIGESTION FROM DRINKING COLD WATER (COLIC).    This disorder is produced by drinking copiously of cold water, which  arrests digestion and produces cramp of the fourth stomach, probably of the  other stomachs, and also of the bowels.    _Causes._---It is not customary for the ox to drink much water at once. In  fact, he usually drinks slowly and as if he were merely tasting the water,  letting some fall out at the corners of his mouth at every mouthful. It  would therefore seem to be contrary to the habits of the ox to drink  copiously; but we find that during hot weather, when he has been working  and is consequently very thirsty, if he drinks a large quantity of cold  water he may be immediately taken with a very severe colic. Cows which are  fed largely on dry hay drink copiously, like the working ox, and become  affected in precisely the same manner. In such cases they are seized with a  chill or fit of trembling before the cramps come on.    _Symptoms._--There is some distension of the abdomen, but no accumulation  of gas. As the distension and pain occur immediately after the animal has  drunk the water, there can be no doubt as to the exciting cause.    _Treatment._--Walk the animal about for 10 minutes before administering  medicine, and this allows time for a portion of the contents of the stomach  to pass into the bowel, and renders it safer to give medicine. In many  cases the walking exercise and the diarrhea bring about a spontaneous cure  of this disorder, but as in some instances the cramps and pains of the  stomachs persist, one may give 1 ounce of sulphuric ether and 1 ounce of  tincture of opium, shaken up with a pint of warm water, and repeat the dose  in half an hour if the animal is not relieved. In an emergency when the  medicine is not to be had, a tablespoonful of powdered ginger may be  administered in a pint of warm water.      INDIGESTION IN CALVES (GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH, DIARRHEA, OR SCOUR).    Calves are subject to a form of diarrhea to which the foregoing  designations have been applied.    _Causes._--Calves that suck their dams are not frequently affected with  this disease, though it may be occasioned by their sucking at long  intervals and thus overloading the stomach and bringing on indigestion,  or from improper feeding of the dam on soft, watery, or damaged feeds.  Suckling the calf at irregular times may also cause it. Exposure to damp  and cold is a potent predisposing cause. Calves separated from their dams  and fed considerable quantities of cold milk at long intervals are liable  to contract this form of indigestion. Calves fed on artificial feed, used  as a substitute for milk, frequently contract it. Damaged feed, sour or  rotten milk, milk from dirty cans, skim milk from a dirty creamery  skim-milk vat, skim milk hauled warm, exposed to the sun and fed from  unclean buckets may all cause this disease.    _Symptoms._--The calf is depressed; appetite is poor; sometimes there is  fever; the extremities are cold. The dung becomes gradually softer and  lighter in color until it is cream colored and little thicker than milk. It  has a most offensive odor and may contain clumps of curd. Later it contains  mucus and gas bubbles. It sticks to the hair of the tail and buttocks,  causing the hair to drop off and the skin to become irritated. There may be  pain on passing dung and also abdominal or colicky pain. The calf stands  about with the back arched and belly contracted. There may be tympanites.  Great weakness ensues in severe cases, and without prompt and successful  treatment death soon follows.    _Treatment._--Remove the cause. Give appropriate feed of best quality in  small quantities. Make sure that the cow furnishing the milk is healthy and  is properly fed. Clean all milk vessels. Clean and disinfect the stalls.  For the diarrhea give two raw eggs or a cup of strong coffee. If the case  is severe, give 1 ounce of castor oil with a teaspoonful of creolin and 20  grains of subnitrate of bismuth. Repeat the bismuth and creolin with  flaxseed tea every four hours. Tannopin may be used in doses of 15 to 30  grains.    Calves artificially fed on whole or skim milk should receive only such milk  as is sweet and has been handled in a sanitary manner. Milk should always  be warmed to the temperature of the body before feeding.

The arbitrary restriction of western settlement by the  Proclamation of 1763 did not stop the more adventurous but did hold back  the mass of the population until near the time of the Revolution, when  a few bands of settlers moved into Kentucky and Tennessee and rendered  important but inconspicuous service in the fighting. But so long as  the title to that territory was in doubt no considerable body of people  would move into it, and it was not until the Treaty of Peace in 1783  determined that the western country as far as the Mississippi River was  to belong to the United States that the dammed-up population broke over  the mountains in a veritable flood.    The western country and its people presented no easy problem to the  United States: how to hold those people when the pull was strong to draw  them from the Union; how to govern citizens so widely separated from the  older communities; and, of most immediate importance, how to hold the  land itself. It was, indeed, the question of the ownership of the land  beyond the mountains which delayed the ratification of the Articles of  Confederation. Some of the States, by right of their colonial charter  grants \"from sea to sea,\" were claiming large parts of the western  region. Other States, whose boundaries were fixed, could put forward  no such claims; and, as they were therefore limited in their area  of expansion, they were fearful lest in the future they should be  overbalanced by those States which might obtain extensive property in  the West. It was maintained that the Proclamation of 1763 had changed  this western territory into \"Crown lands,\" and as, by the Treaty of  Peace, the title had passed to the United States, the non-claimant  States had demanded in self-defense that the western land should belong  to the country as a whole and not to the individual States. Rhode  Island, Maryland, and Delaware were most seriously affected, and they  were insistent upon this point. Rhode Island and at length Delaware gave  in, so that by February, 1779, Maryland alone held out. In May of  that year the instructions of Maryland to her delegates were read in  Congress, positively forbidding them to ratify the plan of union unless  they should receive definite assurances that the western country would  become the common property of the United States. As the consent of  all of the Thirteen States was necessary to the establishment of the  Confederation, this refusal of Maryland brought matters to a crisis.  The question was eagerly discussed, and early in 1780 the deadlock was  broken by the action of New York in authorizing her representatives to  cede her entire claim in western lands to the United States.    It matters little that the claim of New York was not as good as that  of some of the other States, especially that of Virginia. The whole  situation was changed. It was no longer necessary for Maryland to  defend her position; but the claimant States were compelled to justify  themselves before the country for not following New York's example.  Congress wisely refrained from any assertion of jurisdiction, and only  urgently recommended that States having claims to western lands should  cede them in order that the one obstacle to the final ratification of  the Articles of Confederation might be removed.    Without much question Virginia's claim was the strongest; but the  pressure was too great even for her, and she finally yielded, ceding to  the United States, upon certain conditions, all her lands northwest of  the Ohio River. Then the Maryland delegates were empowered to ratify the  Articles of Confederation. This was early in 1781, and in a very short  time the other States had followed the example of New York and Virginia.  Certain of the conditions imposed by Virginia were not acceptable to  Congress, and three years later, upon specific request, that State  withdrew the objectionable conditions and made the cession absolute.    The territory thus ceded, north and west of the Ohio River, constituted  the public domain. Its boundaries were somewhat indefinite, but  subsequent surveys confirmed the rough estimate that it contained from  one to two hundred millions of acres. It was supposed to be worth, on  the average, about a dollar an acre, which would make this property an  asset sufficient to meet the debts of the war and to leave a balance  for the running expenses of the Government. It thereby became one of the  strong bonds holding the Union together.    \"Land!\" was the first cry of the storm-tossed mariners of Columbus. For  three centuries the leading fact of American history has been that soon  after 1600 a body of Europeans, mostly Englishmen, settled on the edge  of the greatest piece of unoccupied agricultural land in the temperate  zone, and proceeded to subdue it to the uses of man. For three centuries  the chief task of American mankind has been to go up westward against  the land and to possess it. Our wars, our independence, our state  building, our political democracy, our plasticity with respect to  immigration, our mobility of thought, our ardor of initiative, our  mildness and our prosperity, all are but incidents or products of this  prime historical fact.*            * Lecture by J. Franklin Jameson before the Trustees of the  Carnegie Institution, at Washington, in 1912, printed in the \"History  Teacher's Magazine,\" vol. IV, 1913, p. 5.      It is seldom that one's attention is so caught and held as by the happy  suggestion that American interest in land or rather interest in American  land--began with the discovery of the continent. Even a momentary  consideration of the subject, however, is sufficient to indicate how  important was the desire for land as a motive of colonization. The  foundation of European governmental and social organizations had been  laid in feudalism--a system of landholding and service. And although  European states might have lost their original feudal character, and  although new classes had arisen, land-holding still remained the basis  of social distinction.    One can readily imagine that America would be considered as El Dorado,  where one of the rarest commodities as well as one of the most precious  possessions was found in almost unlimited quantities that family estates  were sought in America and that to the lower classes it seemed as if a  heaven were opening on earth. Even though available land appeared to be  almost unlimited in quantity and easy to acquire, it was a possession  that was generally increasing in value. Of course wasteful methods of  farming wore out some lands, especially in the South; but, taking it by  and large throughout the country, with time and increasing density of  population the value of the land was increasing. The acquisition of  land was a matter of investment or at least of speculation. In fact, the  purchase of land was one of the favorite get-rich-quick schemes of the  time. George Washington was not the only man who invested largely in  western lands. A list of those who did would read like a political  or social directory of the time. Patrick Henry, James Wilson, Robert  Morris, Gouverneur Morris, Chancellor Kent, Henry Knox, and James Monroe  were among them.*            * Not all the speculators were able to keep what they acquired.  Fifteen million acres of land in Kentucky were offered for sale in 1800  for nonpayment of taxes. Channing, \"History of the United States,\" vol.  IV, p. 91.      It is therefore easy to understand why so much importance attached to  the claims of the several States and to the cession of that western land  by them to the United States. But something more was necessary. If  the land was to attain anything like its real value, settlers must be  induced to occupy it. Of course it was possible to let the people go out  as they pleased and take up land, and to let the Government collect  from them as might be possible at a fixed rate. But experience during  colonial days had shown the weakness of such a method, and Congress was  apparently determined to keep under its own control the region which  it now possessed, to provide for orderly sale, and to permit settlement  only so far as it might not endanger the national interests. The method  of land sales and the question of government for the western country  were recognized as different aspects of the same problem. The Virginia  offer of cession forced the necessity of a decision, and no sooner  was the Virginia offer framed in an acceptable form, in 1783, than two  committees were appointed by Congress to report upon these two questions  of land sales and of government.    Thomas Jefferson was made chairman of both these committees. He was then  forty years old and one of the most remarkable men in the country. Born  on the frontier--his father from the upper middle class, his mother \"a  Randolph\"--he had been trained to an outdoor life; but he was also  a prodigy in his studies and entered William and Mary College with  advanced standing at the age of eighteen. Many stories are told of his  precocity and ability, all of which tend to forecast the later man of  catholic tastes, omnivorous interest, and extensive but superficial  knowledge; he was a strange combination of natural aristocrat and  theoretical democrat, of philosopher and practical politician. After  having been a student in the law office of George Wythe, and being  a friend of Patrick Henry, Jefferson early espoused the cause of  the Revolution, and it was his hand that drafted the Declaration  of Independence. He then resigned from Congress to assist in the  organization of government in his own State. For two years and a half he  served in the Virginia Assembly and brought about the repeal of the  law of entailment, the abolition of primogeniture, the recognition  of freedom of conscience, and the encouragement of education.
