Then  it occurred to me that with these high numbers the rapping must be an  exertion, especially over a period of time, and I then called to mind  about Krall's horses who had rapped out the decimals with their left  hoof, and the units with their right. The next thing, therefore, was to  make her understand the difference between \"right\" and \"left.\" I took  each paw in turn, saying \"right paw!\" and \"left paw!\" And it took her  longer to remember that than I had expected, seeing how quick she had  been up to the present. Yet, at length this too was accomplished and  she gave each paw without mistake. Strange as it may seem, I found  later on that abstract reckoning and spelling came easily enough, while  the movements of any particular portion of the body--with the exception  of those habitually practised--were always attended with greater  difficulty. It would seem as if she understood rightly enough _with her  head_, but had some trouble in translating what she understood into  active motion; and this applies to all, excepting, of course, such  movements as are the result of heredity, where no words, but some other  incentive, such as \"scent\" may possibly come into play. It is difficult  for human beings to grasp that there is life in the sub-conscious, and  that it is in those sub-conscious regions that the will to act arises.    I now explained to her: \"When you give your _left_ paw _once_, it is to  count as _ten_; when you give your _right_ paw _once_, it is to count  as _one only_. For, you see, if we go on counting there is too much  work for one paw to do and it takes too long. Therefore if you want to  say '12,' you must give the _left_ paw _once_, and the _right_ paw  _twice_.\" I repeated this several times and then asked: \"How do you rap  fifteen?\" And Lola rapped one (10) with the left paw and five times  with the right. It was evident that she had understood me perfectly!    This gave me confidence, and that day we did additions up to twenty,  all of which were successful. Indeed, the dog showed much interest in  her work, and came to it readily. As a rule ten to fifteen minutes in  the morning, and another quarter of an hour in the afternoon was  lesson-time. As the results were generally successful, I was sometimes  tempted to continue my questions for a little longer, and she would go  on answering until at length she began to sigh--then I knew that she  was tired. And after such extra exertion I would notice the next day  both by the pupils of her eyes and her nervous trembling, that she had  been over-worked--and the thought of it makes me feel ashamed, even to  this day; for, was I not undertaking the whole study for the sake of  animal creation, and to think that I might have been inflicting any  cruelty was unbearable. And, indeed, as time went on, this did not  occur again, for I kept a keener watch. Soon, too, her capabilities  increased, and she was able to fulfil more easily the greater demands  made on her when answering to questions. With regard to decimals and  units, I made a discovery which is, I think, worth stating. The dog did  not look at me, but seemed, on the contrary (on this occasion), much  interested in gnawing the leg of a chair, and I thought she could not  have understood me, or else she would surely have looked up at me. Yet,  she had apparently only done this to cover her confusion--as it were!  Indeed, this was evident from her expression, and she had heard  everything right enough, for she then--and ever after--rapped her  replies without \"visualizing\"--and I mentally returned thanks to Karl  Krall for the practical advice he had given me, and which had been so  opportune. Rolf rapped with one paw only, as has already been stated;  one was, therefore, obliged at length to put the question to him: \"1 or  10?\" And Rolf would then say \"yes\" or \"no,\" as the case might be. This  is confusing for the onlookers, and, as a matter of fact, when I saw  him at Mannheim I never knew for certain what number he had indicated.  But with Krall's method of using alternate hoof or paw, any confusion  or doubt is ruled out.          CONTINUED TUITION      Lola and I had now become to some extent accustomed to each other, and  the daily progress assisted this mutual understanding. I felt that I  had become calmer and more self-possessed, and this, too, reacted on  the dog. I did my best to make the subjects interesting, and I soon had  only to call her to lessons for her to scamper up to me quite eager to  begin. I also attempted to make her understand that she would be able  to help other dogs--in fact, help all dear animals, if she was  industrious, thus showing people how much a dog could do--when it was  able to count and spell! I told her how much kinder people would then  be to animals, instead of treating them as though they were no better  than wood or stone, and I instanced all Rolf could do, and told her of  the good uses his abilities had been put to. And from thence forward I  rewarded her for every good bit of work with either biscuits or sugar,  on the principle that any creature that works is worthy of wage, since  man receives either food or money. And I would here like to say that I  once heard that the judges examining both Rolf and the horses had taken  exception to the fact of the animals being encouraged to work by being  given \"rewards\"; where, I wonder, is the man who will labour  unrequited? There will, of course, always be exceptional individuals  who will do a thing _for its own sake_--yet--after all--do not _they_,  too, seek their reward? albeit in a more idealistic manner, since it  will consist in the success of their undertaking.    Yet these gentlemen thought that animals ought to exhibit the ethical  single-mindedness of exceptional individuals! The \"mere beast\"--so  belittled, as a rule that it is vouchsafed less \"right to the earth\"  than is the sole of a man's foot! How significant this may be said to  be of the mental attitude in which these gentlemen sat in judgment:  men, who, doubtless, considered they were doing their very utmost in  the service of science!    After Lola had mastered the numerals as far as twenty I started her at  simple multiplication, explaining these again on my fingers and the  counting frame and here, too, I found her a ready pupil. Indeed, there  really _does_ seem something so very obvious in 2 and 2 things being 4  things! and we proceeded by degrees to multiply up to fifty.    I would say, for instance, over the morning coffee: \"Lola, to-day the  fours are to have a turn: 1 x 4 = 4, 2 x 4 = 8,\" and I would let her  multiply with four about three times, straight on from the beginning  first, and then dodging about irregularly. She usually did this without  any mistake whatever, and I was now getting quite used to the celerity  with which she worked. The only difficulties were in connexion with 10  x 3 and 10 x 4, where she would constantly make a slip, for then the  left paw came into action, and her consciousness was not yet  sufficiently concentrated on that left paw. Dogs and horses must, I  imagine, have a most splendid faculty for visualizing figures--to judge  from the rapidity with which they work.    It took us nine days to accomplish the multiplication table from two to  ten, keeping up, of course, a repetition of what had already been  learnt. This great speed is another point that often gives rise to  doubts, yet it is found to be equally the case with all animals who are  taught: I cannot account for it--I can merely say that it is so. I have  thought at times that the reason may lie in the fact that dogs and  horses have but a short span of life in comparison to man's, and  therefore, a briefer period of youth wherein to acquire their stock of  learning; that this might account for an animal being quicker than a  child, which has ampler time and seems to need it all in order to lay a  thorough foundation, since the multitude of subsequent impressions  would otherwise swamp all our earliest rudimentary learning.    Lola answered splendidly. It now happened at times that I myself made  mistakes and believing the fault to be hers, have said: \"That is  wrong!\" But she was not to be put out, and stuck to her reply. Then, on  going over it I would find that she was right after all!    I often put my question thus: \"7 x 4 = ?\" and the reply would be--left  paw 2, right paw 8: then: \"9 x 3 = ?\" Answer: left paw 2, right paw 7;  and again, \"6 x 6 = ?\" Answer: left paw 3, right paw 6. How accurate a  test this was might be gathered from the sure and quiet way in which  she tapped the palm of my hand, first with her left paw three times,  and then with the right, six. I held my hand quite flat, slantingly and  immovable--there was nothing about it that could convey any sort of  sign to her, otherwise she would not sometimes have rapped either less  or more than I expected, as has happened both in her spelling and at  her sums.    My thoughts now turned to the business of spelling and the replies to  be here obtained. A total of figures from 1-40 would suffice in order  to give expression to all the letters, while the same degree of  comprehension of my spoken word was all I required. Then I began to  tell Lola some four or five letters of her alphabet daily, questioning  her as to each. Every day I repeated the lesson learnt on the previous  one, and added four or five more letters. Her alphabet sounds as  follows:        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+------+------+      |   a   |   e   |   i   |   o   |  u  |  au  |  ei  |      |   -   |   -   |   -   |   -   |  -  |   -  |  --  |      |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |  8  |   9  |  10  |      +-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|------|------+      | b & p | d & t | f & v | s & k |  ch |   ue  |   h  |      | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |  -- |  --  |  --  |      |  14   |   15  |   16  |   17  |  20 |  21  |  24  |    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25918"],[0,"Heads and Tales : or, Anecdotes and Stories of Quadrupeds and Other Beasts, (#8)"],[1,"head, and ane o' the bairns's auld  big-coats on his back; and then, sure aneugh, when he takes his stroll  in the avenue, he is a heathenish Christian.    _North._ Why, James, by this time he must be quite like one of the  family?    _Shepherd._ He's a capital flee-fisher.

Sir Thomas Dick Lauder[16] records the adventures of a monkey in  Morayshire, whose wanderings sadly alarmed the inhabitants who saw him,  all unused as they were to the sight of such an exotic stranger.    \"We knew a large monkey, which escaped from his chain, and was abroad in  Morayshire for some eight or ten days. Wherever he appeared he spread  terror among the peasantry. A poor fisherman on the banks of the  Findhorn was sitting with his wife and family at their frugal meal, when  a hairy little man, as they in their ignorance conceived him to be,  appeared on the window sill and grinned, and chattered through the  casement what seemed to them to be the most horrible incantations.  Horror-struck, the poor people crowded together on their knees on the  floor, and began to exorcise him with prayers most vehemently, until  some external cause of alarm made their persecutor vanish. The  neighbours found the family half dead with fear, and could with  difficulty extract from them the cause. 'Oh! worthy neebours!' at last  exclaimed the goodman with a groan, 'we ha'e seen the _Enemy_ glowrin'  at us through that vera wundow there. Lord keep us a'!!' He next alarmed  a little hamlet near the hills; appearing and disappearing to various  individuals in a most mysterious manner; till at last a clown, with a  few grains of more courage than the rest, loaded his gun and put a  sixpence into it, with the intention of stealing upon him as he sat most  mysteriously chattering on the top of a cairn of stones, and then  shooting him with silver, which is known never to fail in finishing the  imps of the Evil One. And lucky indeed was it for pug that he chanced,  through whim, to abscond from that quarter; for if he had not so  disappeared, he might have died by the lead, if not by the silver. As it  was, the bold peasant laid claim to the full glory of compelling this  dreaded goblin to flee.\"    Sir Thomas Lauder kept several pets in his beautiful seat at the Grange,  long occupied by the Messrs Dalgleish of Dreghorn Castle as a genteel  boarding-school, and now by the Misses Mouatt as one for young ladies.  We have often seen the tombstones to his dogs, which were buried to the  south of that mansion, in which Principal Robertson the historian died,  and where Lord Brougham, his relation, used to go when a boy at the High  School.      THE FRENCH MARQUIS AND HIS MONKEY.    Dr John Moore, the father of General Moore, who fell at Corunna, in one  of the graphic sketches of a Frenchman which he gives in his work on  Italy, records a visit he paid to the Marquis de F---- at Besancon.  After many questions, he says, \"Before I could make any answer, I  chanced to turn my eyes upon a person whom I had not before observed,  who sat very gravely upon a chair in a corner of the room, with a large  periwig in full dress upon his head. The marquis, seeing my surprise at  the sight of this unknown person, after a very hearty fit of laughter,  begged pardon for not having introduced me sooner to that gentleman (who  was no other than a large monkey), and then told me, he had the honour  of being attended by a physician, who had the reputation of possessing  the greatest skill, and who _certainly_ wore the largest periwigs of any  doctor in the province. That one morning, while he was writing a  prescription at his bedside, this same monkey had catched hold of his  periwig by one of the knots, and instantly made the best of his way out  at the window to the roof of a neighbouring house, from which post he  could not be dislodged, till the doctor, having lost patience, had sent  home for another wig, and never after could be prevailed on to accept of  this, which had been so much disgraced. That, _enfin_, his valet, to  whom the monkey belonged, had, ever since that adventure, obliged the  culprit by way of punishment to sit quietly, for an hour every morning,  with the periwig on his head.--Et pendant ces moments de tranquillite je  suis honore de la societe du venerable personage. Then, addressing  himself to the monkey, \"Adieu, mon ami, pour aujourdhui--au plaisir de  vous revoir;\" and the servant immediately carried Monsieur le Medicin  out of the room.[17]    This is a most characteristic bit, which could scarcely have occurred  out of France, where monkeys and dogs are petted as we never saw them  petted elsewhere. These things were so when we knew Paris under  Louis-Philippe. Frenchmen, surely, have not much changed under Louis  Napoleon.      THE MANDRILL AND GEORGE THE FOURTH.    One of the attractive sights of Mr Cross's menagerie, some forty years  or so ago, was a full-grown baboon, to which had been given the name of  \"Happy Jerry.\" He was conspicuous from the finely-coloured rib-like  ridges on each side of his cheeks, the clear blue and scarlet hue of  which, on such a hideous long face and muzzle, with its small,  deeply-sunk malicious eyes, and projecting brow and cheeks, seemed  almost as if beauty and bestiality were here combined. But Jerry had a  habit which would have made Father Matthew loathe him and those who  encouraged him. He had been taught to sit in an armchair and to drink  porter out of a pot, like a thirsty brickmaker; and, as an addition to  his accomplishments, he could also smoke a pipe, like a trained pupil of  Sir Walter Raleigh. This rib-nosed baboon, or mandrill, as he is often  called, obtained great renown; and among other distinguished personages  who wished to see him was his late majesty King George the Fourth. As  that king seldom during his reign frequented places of public resort, Mr  Cross was invited to bring Jerry to Windsor or Brighton, to display the  talents of his redoubtable baboon. I have heard Mr Cross say, that the  king placed his hands on the arm of one of the ladies of the Court, at  which Jerry began to show such unmistakable signs of ferocity, that the  mild, kind menagerist was glad to get Jerry removed, or at least the  king and his courtiers to withdraw. He showed his great teeth and  grinned and growled, as a baboon in a rage is apt to do. Jerry was a  powerful beast, especially in his fore-legs or arms. When he died, Mr  Cross presented his skin to the British Museum, where it has been long  preserved. The mandrill is a native of West Africa, where he is much  dreaded by the negroes.    In Cross's menagerie at Walworth, nearly twenty years ago, there was  generally a fine mandrill. We remember the sulky ferocity of that  restless eye. How angry the mild menagerist used to be at the ladies in  the monkey-room with their parasols! These appendages were the feelers  with which some of the softer sex used to touch Cross's monkeys, and, as  the old gentleman used to insist, helped to kill them. Parasols were  freely used to touch the boas and other snakes feeding in the same warm  room. No doubt a boa-constrictor could not live comfortably if his soft,  muscular sides got fifty pokes a day from as many sticks or parasols.  Edward Cross, mild, gentle, gentlemanly, Prince of show-keepers, used to  be very indignant at the inquisitorial desire possessed, especially by  some of the fairer sex, to try the relative hardness and softness of  serpents and monkeys, and other mammals and creatures. This story of the  mandrill may excuse this pendant of an episode.      THE YOUNG LADY'S PET MONKEY AND HER PARROT.    Horace Walpole tells an anecdote of a fine young French lady, a Madame  de Choiseul. She longed for a parrot that should be a miracle of  eloquence. A parrot was soon found for her in Paris. She also became  enamoured of General Jacko, a celebrated monkey, at Astley's. But the  possessor was so exorbitant in his demand for Jacko, that the General  did not change proprietors. Another monkey was soon heard of, who had  been brought up by a cook in a kitchen, where he had learned to pluck  fowls with inimitable dexterity. This accomplished pet was bought and  presented to Madame, who accepted him. The first time she went out, the  two animals were locked up in her bed-chamber. When the lady returned,  the monkey was alone to be seen. Search, was made for Pretty Poll, and  to her horror she was found at last under bed, shivering and cowering,  and without a feather. It seems that the two pets had been presented by  rival lovers of Madame. Poll's presenter concluded that his rival had  given the monkey with that very view, challenged him; they fought, and  both were wounded: and a heroic adventure it was![18]      MONKEYS POOR RELATIONS.    One of Luttrell's sayings, recorded by Sydney Smith, was,--    \"I hate the sight of monkeys, they remind me so of poor relations.\" Here  follows a fine passage of Sydney Smith, which he might have written  after hearing the lectures of Professor Huxley.[19] \"I confess I feel  myself so much at my ease about the superiority of mankind,--I have such  a marked and decided contempt for the understanding of every baboon I  have yet seen,--I feel so sure that the blue ape without a tail will  never rival us in poetry, painting, and music,--that I see no reason  whatever why justice may not be done to the few fragments of soul, and  tatters of understanding, which they may really possess. I have  sometimes, perhaps, felt a little uneasy at Exeter 'Change, from  contrasting the monkeys with the 'prentice boys who are teasing them;  but a few pages of Locke, or a few lines of"]]]
