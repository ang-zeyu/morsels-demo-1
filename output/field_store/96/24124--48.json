The extensive varieties of plane iron in use are       fitted for every requirement; a very ingenious arrangement is       applied to the tools for planing the insides of circles or other       curved works, such as stair-rails, etc. The sole of the plane is       formed of a plate of tempered steel about the thickness of a       handsaw, according to the length required, and this plate is       adapted to the curve, and is securely fixed at each end. With this       tool the work is not only done better but in less time than       formerly. In some exhibits the face of the plane was made of beech       or of other hard wood, secured by screws to the stock, and the tool       becomes a hybrid, all other parts remaining the same as in the iron       plane.[20]    The popularity of Bailey's patented planes (fig. 65), the type so  praised above, was by no means transitory. In 1884 the Boston firm of  Goodnow & Wightman, \"Importers, Manufacturers and Dealers in Tools of  all kinds,\" illustrated the several planes just described and assured  prospective buyers that         These tools meet with universal approbation from the best       Mechanics. For beauty of style and finish they are unequalled, and       the great convenience in operating renders them the cheapest Planes       in use; they are SELF-ADJUSTING in every respect; and each part       being made INTERCHANGEABLE, can be replaced at a trifling       expense.[21]    By 1900 an advertisement for Bailey's planes published in the catalogue  of another Boston firm, Chandler and Farquhar, indicated that \"over  900,000\" had already been sold.[22]    Other mass-produced edge tools--axes, adzes, braces and bits, augers,  saws, and chisels--illustrated in the trade literature of the toolmakers  became, as had the iron-bodied bench plane, standard forms. In the last  quarter of the 19th century the tool catalogue replaced Moxon, Duhamel,  Diderot, and the builders' manuals as the primary source for the study  and identification of hand tools. The Centennial had called attention to  the superiority of certain American tools and toolmakers. The result was  that until the end of the century, trade literature faithfully drummed  the products that had proven such \"an attraction to the numerous  artisans who visited the Centennial Exhibition from the United States  and other countries.\"[23]    [Illustration: Figure 63.--1870: THE METALLIC VERSION OF THE PLOW PLANE  later produced by Stanley and Company was patented by [Charles] G.  Miller as a tool readily \"convertible into a grooving, rabbeting, or  smoothing plane.\" In production this multipurpose plow gained an  elaborate decoration (fig. 51) nowhere suggested in Miller's  specification. (Wash drawing from U.S. Patent Office, June 28, 1870,  Record Group 241, the National Archives.)]    [Illustration: Figure 64.--1867: THE DRAWING accompanying B.A. Blandin's  specification for an \"Improvement in Bench Planes\" retained only the  familiarly shaped handle or tote of the traditional wood-bodied plane.  This new shape rapidly became the standard form of the tool with later  variations chiefly related to the adjustability of the plane-iron and  sole. (Wash drawing from U.S. Patent Office, May 7, 1867, Record Group  241, the National Archives.)]    Collins and Company of New York City had been given commendation for the  excellence of their axes; through the end of the century, Collins' brand  felling axes, broad axes, and adzes were standard items, as witness  Hammacher, Schlemmer and Company's catalogue of 1896.[24] Disston saws  were a byword, and the impact of their exhibit at Philadelphia was still  strong, as judged from Baldwin, Robbins' catalogue of 1894. Highly  recommended was the Disston no. 76, the \"Centennial\" handsaw with its  \"skew back\" and \"apple handle.\" Jennings' patented auger bits were  likewise standard fare in nearly every tool catalogue.[25] So were bench  planes manufactured by companies that had been cited at Philadelphia for  the excellence of their product; namely, The Metallic Plane Company,  Auburn, New York; The Middletown Tool Company, Middletown, Connecticut;  Bailey, Leonard, and Company, Hartford; and The Sandusky Tool Company,  Sandusky, Ohio.[26]    An excellent indication of the persistence of the Centennial influence,  and of the tool catalogue as source material, is seen in Chandler and  Farquhar's illustrated pamphlet of 1900. Their advertisement for  Barber's improved ratchet brace (fig. 66), a tool much admired by the  Centennial judges, amply illustrates the evolution of design of a basic  implement present in American society since the first years of  settlement. The Barber brace represents the ultimate sophistication of a  tool, achieved through an expanded industrial technology rather than by  an extended or newly found use for the device itself. It is a prime  example of the transition of a tool from Moxon to its perfected form in  the 20th century:         These Braces possess the following points of superiority: The Sweep       is made from Steel; the Jaws are forged from Steel; the Wood Handle       has brass rings inserted in each end so it cannot split off; the       Chuck has a hardened Steel antifriction washer between the two       sockets, thus reducing the wear. The Head has a bearing of steel       balls, running on hard steel plates, so no wear can take place, as       the friction is reduced to the minimum. The Brace is heavily       nickel-plated and warranted in every particular. We endeavor to       make these goods as nearly perfection as is possible in durability,       quality of material and workmanship, and fineness and beauty of       finish.[27]    [Illustration: Figure 65.--1900: AMERICAN PLANEMAKERS had been cited at  the Philadelphia Centennial as having introduced a dramatic change in  the nature of the tool. Although wood-bodied planes continued to be  used, they were outdated and in fact anachronistic by the close of the  19th century. From the 1870's forward, it was the iron-bodied plane,  most frequently Bailey's, that enlivened the trade literature.  (Catalogue of Chandler and Farquhar, Boston, 1900. Smithsonian photo  55798.)]    [Illustration: Figure 66.--1900: FEW TOOLS SUGGEST MORE CLEARLY the  influence of modern industrial society upon the design and construction  of traditional implements than Barber's ratchet brace. It is not without  interest that as the tools of the wood craftsman became crisply  efficient, his work declined correspondingly in individuality and  character. The brace and the plane, as followed from Moxon through the  trade literature of the late 19th century, achieved perfection in form  and operation at a time when their basic functions had been usurped by  machines. (Catalogue of Chandler and Farquhar, Boston, 1900. Smithsonian  photo 56626.)]    The description of Barber's brace documents a major technical change:  wood to steel, leather washers to ball bearings, and natural patina to  nickel plate. It is also an explanation for the appearance and shape of  craftmen's tools, either hand forged or mass produced. In each case, the  sought-after result in the form of a finished product has been an  implement of \"fineness and beauty.\" This quest motivated three centuries  of toolmakers and brought vitality to hand-tool design. Moxon had  advised:      He that will a good Edge win,    Must Forge thick and Grind thin.[28]    If heeded, the result would be an edge tool that assured its owner \"ease  and delight.\"[29] Throughout the period considered here, the most  praiseworthy remarks made about edge tools were variations of either  \"unsurpassed in quality, finish, and beauty of style\" or, more simply,  commendation for \"excellent design and superior workmanship.\"[30] The  hand tool thus provoked the same value words in the 19th as in the 17th  century.    The aesthetics of industrial art, whether propounded by Moxon or by an  official at the Philadelphia Centennial, proved the standard measure by  which quality could be judged. Today these values are particularly valid  when applied to a class of artifacts that changed slowly and have as  their prime characteristics anonymity of maker and date. With such  objects the origin, transition, and variation of shape are of primary  interest. Consider the common auger whose \"Office\" Moxon declared \"is to  make great round holes\" and whose importance was so clearly stressed at  Philadelphia in 1876.[31] Neither its purpose nor its gross appearance  (a T-handled boring tool) had changed. The tool did, however, develop  qualitatively through 200 years, from a pod or shell to a spiral bit,  from a blunt to a gimlet point, and from a hand-fashioned to a  geometrically exact, factory-made implement: innovations associated with  Cooke (1770), L'Hommedieu (1809), and Jennings (1850's). In each  instance the tool was improved--a double spiral facilitated the  discharge of shavings, a gimlet point allowed the direct insertion of  the auger, and machine precision brought mathematical accuracy to the  degree of twist. Still, overall appearance did not change. At the  Centennial, Moxon would have recognized an auger, and, further, his  lecture on its uses would have been singularly current. The large-bore  spiral auger still denoted a mortise, tenon, and trenail mode of  building in a wood-based technology; at the same time its near cousin,  the wheelwright's reamer, suggested the reliance upon a transport  dependent upon wooden hubs. The auger in its perfected form--fine steel,  perfectly machined, and highly finished--contrasted with an auger of  earlier vintage will clearly show the advance from forge to factory, but  will indicate little new in its method of use or its intended purpose.    Persons neither skilled in the use of tools nor interested in technical  history will find that there is another response to the common auger, as  there was to the upholsterer's hammer, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#8)"],[1,"the testimonial. If you had said  to a medieval peasant, 'Robert the Bowyer proclaims, with three blasts  of a horn, that he makes good bows,' the peasant would have said, 'Well,  of course he does,' and thought about something more important. It is  only among people whose minds have been weakened by a sort of mesmerism  that so transparent a trick as that of advertisement could ever have  been tried at all. And if ever we have again, as for other reasons I  cannot but hope we shall, a more democratic distribution of property and  a more agricultural basis of national life, it would seem at first sight  only too likely that all this beautiful superstition will perish, and  the fairyland of Broadway with all its varied rainbows fade away. For  such people the Seventh Heaven Cigar, like the nineteenth-century city,  will have ended in smoke. And even the smoke of it will have vanished.    But the next stage of reflection brings us back to the peasant looking  at the lights of Broadway. It is not true to say in the strict sense  that the peasant has never seen such things before. The truth is that he  has seen them on a much smaller scale, but for a much larger purpose.  Peasants also have their ritual and ornament, but it is to adorn more  real things. Apart from our first fancy about the peasant who could not  read, there is no doubt about what would be apparent to a peasant who  could read, and who could understand. For him also fire is sacred, for  him also colour is symbolic. But where he sets up a candle to light the  little shrine of St. Joseph, he finds it takes twelve hundred candles to  light the Seventh Heaven Cigar. He is used to the colours in church  windows showing red for martyrs or blue for madonnas; but here he can  only conclude that all the colours of the rainbow belong to Mr. Bilge.  Now upon the aesthetic side he might well be impressed; but it is  exactly on the social and even scientific side that he has a right to  criticise. If he were a Chinese peasant, for instance, and came from a  land of fireworks, he would naturally suppose that he had happened to  arrive at a great firework display in celebration of something; perhaps  the Sacred Emperor's birthday, or rather birthnight. It would gradually  dawn on the Chinese philosopher that the Emperor could hardly be born  every night. And when he learnt the truth the philosopher, if he was a  philosopher, would be a little disappointed ... possibly a little  disdainful.    Compare, for instance, these everlasting fireworks with the damp squibs  and dying bonfires of Guy Fawkes Day. That quaint and even queer  national festival has been fading for some time out of English life.  Still, it was a national festival, in the double sense that it  represented some sort of public spirit pursued by some sort of popular  impulse. People spent money on the display of fireworks; they did not  get money by it. And the people who spent money were often those who had  very little money to spend. It had something of the glorious and  fanatical character of making the poor poorer. It did not, like the  advertisements, have only the mean and materialistic character of making  the rich richer. In short, it came from the people and it appealed to  the nation. The historical and religious cause in which it originated is  not mine; and I think it has perished partly through being tied to a  historical theory for which there is no future. I think this is  illustrated in the very fact that the ceremonial is merely negative and  destructive. Negation and destruction are very noble things as far as  they go, and when they go in the right direction; and the popular  expression of them has always something hearty and human about it. I  shall not therefore bring any fine or fastidious criticism, whether  literary or musical, to bear upon the little boys who drag about a  bolster and a paper mask, calling out           Guy Fawkes Guy       Hit him in the eye.      But I admit it is a disadvantage that they have not a saint or hero to  crown in effigy as well as a traitor to burn in effigy. I admit that  popular Protestantism has become too purely negative for people to  wreathe in flowers the statue of Mr. Kensit or even of Dr. Clifford. I  do not disguise my preference for popular Catholicism; which still has  statues that can be wreathed in flowers. I wish our national feast of  fireworks revolved round something positive and popular. I wish the  beauty of a Catherine Wheel were displayed to the glory of St.  Catherine. I should not especially complain if Roman candles were really  Roman candles. But this negative character does not destroy the national  character; which began at least in disinterested faith and has ended at  least in disinterested fun. There is nothing disinterested at all about  the new commercial fireworks. There is nothing so dignified as a dingy  guy among the lights of Broadway. In that thoroughfare, indeed, the very  word guy has another and milder significance. An American friend  congratulated me on the impression I produced on a lady interviewer,  observing, 'She says you're a regular guy.' This puzzled me a little at  the time. 'Her description is no doubt correct,' I said, 'but I confess  that it would never have struck me as specially complimentary.' But it  appears that it is one of the most graceful of compliments, in the  original American. A guy in America is a colourless term for a human  being. All men are guys, being endowed by their Creator with certain ...  but I am misled by another association. And a regular guy means, I  presume, a reliable or respectable guy. The point here, however, is that  the guy in the grotesque English sense does represent the dilapidated  remnant of a real human tradition of symbolising real historic ideals by  the sacramental mystery of fire. It is a great fall from the lowest of  these lowly bonfires to the highest of the modern sky-signs. The new  illumination does not stand for any national ideal at all; and what is  yet more to the point, it does not come from any popular enthusiasm at  all. That is where it differs from the narrowest national Protestantism  of the English institution. Mobs have risen in support of No Popery; no  mobs are likely to rise in defence of the New Puffery. Many a poor crazy  Orangeman has died saying, 'To Hell with the Pope'; it is doubtful  whether any man will ever, with his last breath, frame the ecstatic  words, 'Try Hugby's Chewing Gum.' These modern and mercantile legends  are imposed upon us by a mercantile minority, and we are merely passive  to the suggestion. The hypnotist of high finance or big business merely  writes his commands in heaven with a finger of fire. All men really are  guys, in the sense of dummies. We are only the victims of his  pyrotechnic violence; and it is he who hits us in the eye.    This is the real case against that modern society that is symbolised by  such art and architecture. It is not that it is toppling, but that it is  top-heavy. It is not that it is vulgar, but rather that it is not  popular. In other words, the democratic ideal of countries like America,  while it is still generally sincere and sometimes intense, is at issue  with another tendency, an industrial progress which is of all things on  earth the most undemocratic. America is not alone in possessing the  industrialism, but she is alone in emphasising the ideal that strives  with industrialism. Industrial capitalism and ideal democracy are  everywhere in controversy; but perhaps only here are they in conflict.  France has a democratic ideal; but France is not industrial. England and  Germany are industrial; but England and Germany are not really  democratic. Of course when I speak here of industrialism I speak of  great industrial areas; there is, as will be noted later, another side  to all these countries; there is in America itself not only a great deal  of agricultural society, but a great deal of agricultural equality;  just as there are still peasants in Germany and may some day again be  peasants in England. But the point is that the ideal and its enemy the  reality are here crushed very close to each other in the high, narrow  city; and that the sky-scraper is truly named because its top, towering  in such insolence, is scraping the stars off the American sky, the very  heaven of the American spirit.    That seems to me the main outline of the whole problem. In the first  chapter of this book, I have emphasised the fact that equality is still  the ideal though no longer the reality of America. I should like to  conclude this one by emphasising the fact that the reality of modern  capitalism is menacing that ideal with terrors and even splendours that  might well stagger the wavering and impressionable modern spirit. Upon  the issue of that struggle depends the question of whether this new  great civilisation continues to exist, and even whether any one cares if  it exists or not. I have already used the parable of the American flag,  and the stars that stand for a multitudinous equality; I might here take  the opposite symbol of these artificial and terrestrial stars flaming on  the forehead of the commercial city; and note the peril of the last  illusion, which is that the artificial stars may seem to fill the  heavens, and the real stars to have faded from sight. But I am content  for the moment to reaffirm the merely imaginative pleasure of those  dizzy turrets and dancing fires. If those nightmare buildings were  really all built for nothing, how noble they would be! The fact that  they were really built for something need not unduly depress us for a  moment, or drag down our soaring fancies. There is something about these  vertical lines that suggests a sort of rush upwards, as of great  cataracts topsy-turvy. I have spoken of fireworks, but here I should  rather speak of rockets. There is only something underneath the mind  murmuring that nothing "]]]
