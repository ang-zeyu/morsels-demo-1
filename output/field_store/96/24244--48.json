It was not according to his desire that Ranald was sent to the manse.  That was the doing of his sister, Kirsty, who for the last ten years  had kept house for him. Not that there was much housekeeping skill about  Kirsty, as indeed any one might see even without entering Macdonald  Dubh's house. Kirsty was big and strong and willing, but she had not  the most elemental ideas of tidiness. Her red, bushy hair hung in wisps  about her face, after the greater part of it had been gathered into a  tight knob at the back of her head. She was a martyr to the \"neuralagy,\"  and suffered from a perennial cold in the head, which made it necessary  for her to wear a cloud, which was only removed when it could be  replaced by her nightcap. Her face always bore the marks of her labors,  and from it one could gather whether she was among the pots or busy with  the baking. But she was kindhearted, and, up to her light, sought to  fill the place left empty by the death of the wife and mother in that  home, ten years before.    When the minister's wife opened the door, a hot, close, foul smell  rushed forth to meet her. Upon the kitchen stove a large pot of  pig's food was boiling, and the steam and smell from the pot made  the atmosphere of the room overpoweringly fetid. Off the kitchen or  living-room were two small bedrooms, in one of which lay Macdonald Dubh.    Kirsty met the minister's wife with a warm welcome. She helped her  off with her hood and coat, patting her on the shoulder the while, and  murmuring words of endearment.    \"Ah, M'eudail! M'eudail bheg! and did you come through the night all the  way, and it is ashamed that I am to have sent for you, but he was very  bad and I was afraid. Come away! come away! I will make you a cup of  tea.\" But the minister's wife assured Kirsty that she was glad to come,  and declining the cup of tea, went to the room where Macdonald Dubh lay  tossing and moaning with the delirium of fever upon him. It was not long  before she knew what was required.    With hot fomentations she proceeded to allay the pain, and in half an  hour Macdonald Dubh grew quiet. His tossings and mutterings ceased and  he fell into a sleep.    Kirsty stood by admiring.    \"Mercy me! Look at that now; and it is yourself that is the great  doctor!\"    \"Now, Kirsty,\" said Mrs. Murray, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \"we will  just make him a little more comfortable.\"    \"Yes,\" said Kirsty, not quite sure how the feat was to be achieved. \"A  little hot something for his inside will be good, but indeed, many's the  drink I have given him,\" she suggested.    \"What have you been giving him, Kirsty?\"    \"Senny and dandylion, and a little whisky. They will be telling me it is  ferry good whatever for the stomach and bow'ls.\"    \"I don't think I would give him any more of that; but we will try and  make him feel a little more comfortable.\"    Mrs. Murray knew she was treading on delicate ground. The Highland pride  is quick to take offense.    \"Sick people, you see,\" she proceeded carefully, \"need very frequent  changes--sheets and clothing, you understand.\"    \"Aye,\" said Kirsty, suspiciously.    \"I am sure you have plenty of beautiful sheets, and we will change these  when he wakes from his sleep.\"    \"Indeed, they are very clean, for there is no one but myself has slept  in them since he went away last fall to the shanties.\"    Mrs. Murray felt the delicacy of the position to be sensibly increased.    \"Indeed, that is right, Kirsty; one can never tell just what sort of  people are traveling about nowadays.\"    \"Indeed, and it's true,\" said Kirsty, heartily, \"but I never let them in  here. I just keep them to the bunk.\"    \"But,\" pursued Mrs. Murray, returning to the subject in hand, \"it is  very important that for sick people the sheets should be thoroughly  aired and warmed. Why, in the hospital in Montreal they take the very  greatest care to air and change the sheets every day. You see so much  poison comes through the pores of the skin.\"    \"Do you hear that now?\" said Kirsty, amazed. \"Indeed, I would be often  hearing that those French people are just full of poison and such, and  indeed, it is no wonder, for the food they put inside of them.\"    \"O, no, \" said Mrs. Murray, \"it is the same with all people, but  especially so with sick people.\"    Kirsty looked as doubtful as was consistent with her respect for the  minister's wife, and Mrs. Murray went on.    \"So you will just get the sheets ready to change, and, Kirsty, a clean  night-shirt.\"    \"Night-shirt! and indeed, he has not such a thing to his name.\" Kirsty's  tone betrayed her thankfulness that her brother was free from the  effeminacy of a night-shirt; but noting the dismay and confusion on Mrs.  Murray's face, she suggested, hesitatingly, \"He might have one of my  own, but I am thinking it will be small for him across the back.\"    \"I am afraid so, Kirsty,\" said the minister's wife, struggling hard  with a smile. \"We will just use one of his own white shirts.\" But this  scandalized Kirsty as an unnecessary and wasteful luxury.    \"Indeed, there is plenty of them in the chist, but he will be keeping  them for the communion season, and the funerals, and such. He will not  be wearing them in his bed, for no one will be seeing him there at all.\"    \"But he will feel so much better,\" said Mrs. Murray, and her smile was  so sweet and winning that Kirsty's opposition collapsed, and without  more words both sheets and shirt were produced.    As Kirsty laid them out she observed with a sigh: \"Aye, aye, she was  the clever woman--the wife, I mean. She was good with the needle, and  indeed, at anything she tried to do.\"    \"I did not know her,\" said Mrs. Murray, softly, \"but every one tells me  she was a good housekeeper and a good woman.\"    \"She was that,\" said Kirsty, emphatically, \"and she was the light of his  eyes, and it was a bad day for Hugh when she went away.\"    \"Now, Kirsty,\" said Mrs. Murray, after a pause, \"before we put on these  clean things, we will just give him a sponge bath.\"    Kirsty gasped.    \"Mercy sakes! He will not be needing that in the winter, and he will be  getting a cold from it. In the summer-time he will be going to the river  himself. And how will you be giving him a bath whatever?\"    Mrs. Murray carefully explained the process, again fortifying her  position by referring to the practices of the Montreal hospital, till,  as a result of her persuasions and instructions, in an hour after  Macdonald had awakened from his sleep he was lying in his Sabbath white  shirt and between fresh sheets, and feeling cleaner and more comfortable  than he had for many a day. The fever was much reduced, and he fell  again into a deep sleep.    The two women watched beside him, for neither would leave the other  to watch alone. And Ranald, who could not be persuaded to go up to  his loft, lay on the bunk in the kitchen and dozed. After an hour had  passed, Mrs. Murray inquired as to the nourishment Kirsty had given her  brother.    \"Indeed, he will not be taking anything whatever,\" said Kirsty, in a  vexed tone. \"And it is no matter what I will be giving him.\"    \"And what does he like, Kirsty?\"    \"Indeed, he will be taking anything when he is not seek, and he is that  fond of buckwheat pancakes and pork gravy with maple syrup over them,  but would he look at it! And I made him new porridge to-night, but he  would not touch them.\"    \"Did you try him with gruel, Kirsty?\"    \"Mercy me, and is it Macdonald Dubh and gruel? He would be flinging the  'feushionless' stuff out of the window.\"    \"But I am sure it would be good for him if he could be persuaded to try  it. I should like to try him.\"    \"Indeed, and you may try. It will be easy enough, for the porridge are  still in the pot.\"    Kirsty took the pot from the bench, with the remains of the porridge  that had been made for supper still in it, set it on the fire, and  pouring some water in it, began to stir it vigorously. It was thick and  slimy, and altogether a most repulsive-looking mixture, and Mrs. Murray  no longer wondered at Macdonald Dubh's distaste for gruel.    \"I think I will make some fresh, if you will let me, Kirsty--in the way  I make it for the minister, you know.\"    Kirsty, by this time, had completely surrendered to Mrs. Murray's  guidance, and producing the oatmeal, allowed her to have her way; so  that when Macdonald awoke he found Mrs. Murray standing beside him with  a bowl of the nicest gruel and a slice of thin dry toast.    He greeted the minister's wife with grave courtesy, drank the gruel, and  then lay down again to sleep.    \"Will you look at that now?\" said Kirsty, amazed at Macdonald Dubh's  forbearance. \"He would not like to be offending you.\"    Then Mrs. Murray besought Kirsty to go and lie down for an hour, which  Kirsty very unwillingly agreed to do.    It was not long before Macdonald began to toss and mutter in his sleep,  breaking forth now and then into wild cries and curses. He was fighting  once more his great fight in the Glengarry line, and beating back  LeNoir.    \"Back, ye devil! Would ye? Take that, then. Come back, Mack!\" Then  followed a cry so wild that Ranald awoke and came into the room.    \"Bring in some snow, Ranald,\" said the minister's wife; \"we will lay  some on his head.\"    She bathed the hot face and hands with ice-cold water, and then laid a  snow compress on the sick man's head, speaking to him in quiet, gentle  tones, till he was soothed again to sleep.    When the gray light of the morning came in through the little window,  Macdonald woke sane and quiet.    \"You are better,\" said Mrs. Murray to him.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I am very well, thank you, except for the pain here.\"  He pointed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#8)"],[1,"with his badge upon the forearm.\"    \"That's my idea, too,\" said White Mason.    \"Well, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our  difficulties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into  the house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this  weapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the  dead man, which will, when mentioned in the papers, tell other members  of the society that vengeance has been done. That all hangs together.  But why this gun, of all weapons?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"And why the missing ring?\"    \"Quite so.\"    \"And why no arrest? It's past two now. I take it for granted that since  dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet  stranger?\"    \"That is so, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"Well, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready,  they can hardly miss him. And yet they HAVE missed him up to now!\"  Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood  mark on the sill. \"It is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably  broad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can  trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a  more shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What's  this under the side table?\"    \"Mr. Douglas's dumb-bells,\" said Ames.    \"Dumb-bell--there's only one. Where's the other?\"    \"I don't know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not  noticed them for months.\"    \"One dumb-bell--\" Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were  interrupted by a sharp knock at the door.    A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us. I  had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I had  heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance  from face to face.    \"Sorry to interrupt your consultation,\" said he, \"but you should hear  the latest news.\"    \"An arrest?\"    \"No such luck. But they've found his bicycle. The fellow left his  bicycle behind him. Come and have a look. It is within a hundred yards  of the hall door.\"    We found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive  inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens  in which it had been concealed. It was a well used Rudge-Whitworth,  splashed as from a considerable journey. There was a saddlebag with  spanner and oilcan, but no clue as to the owner.    \"It would be a grand help to the police,\" said the inspector, \"if these  things were numbered and registered. But we must be thankful for what  we've got. If we can't find where he went to, at least we are likely to  get where he came from. But what in the name of all that is wonderful  made the fellow leave it behind? And how in the world has he got away  without it? We don't seem to get a gleam of light in the case, Mr.  Holmes.\"    \"Don't we?\" my friend answered thoughtfully. \"I wonder!\"          Chapter 5--The People of the Drama        \"Have you seen all you want of the study?\" asked White Mason as we  reentered the house.    \"For the time,\" said the inspector, and Holmes nodded.    \"Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the  people in the house. We could use the dining room, Ames. Please come  yourself first and tell us what you know.\"    The butler's account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a  convincing impression of sincerity. He had been engaged five years  before, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr.  Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had  been a kind and considerate employer--not quite what Ames was used  to, perhaps; but one can't have everything. He never saw any signs of  apprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most fearless  man he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every  night because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked  to keep the old ways up.    Mr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the village; but on the day  before the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had  observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas  that day; for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual  with him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in the pantry at  the back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell  ring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he would,  as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there  were several closed doors and a long passage between. The housekeeper  had come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell.  They had gone to the front of the house together.    As they reached the bottom of the stairs he had seen Mrs. Douglas coming  down it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was  particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr.  Barker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and  begged her to go back.    \"For God's sake, go back to your room!\" he cried. \"Poor Jack is dead!  You can do nothing. For God's sake, go back!\"    After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back.  She did not scream. She made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the  housekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom.  Ames and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study, where they had found  everything exactly as the police had seen it. The candle was not lit at  that time; but the lamp was burning. They had looked out of the window;  but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard. They had  then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the windlass which  lowered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried off to get the  police.    Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler.    The account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a  corroboration of that of her fellow servant. The housekeeper's room was  rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames  had been working. She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing  of the bell had attracted her attention. She was a little hard of  hearing. Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot; but in any  case the study was a long way off. She remembered hearing some sound  which she imagined to be the slamming of a door. That was a good deal  earlier--half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr.  Ames ran to the front she went with him. She saw Mr. Barker, very pale  and excited, come out of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who was  coming down the stairs. He entreated her to go back, and she answered  him, but what she said could not be heard.    \"Take her up! Stay with her!\" he had said to Mrs. Allen.    She had therefore taken her to the bedroom, and endeavoured to soothe  her. She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other  attempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dressing gown by her  bedroom fire, with her head sunk in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with  her most of the night. As to the other servants, they had all gone  to bed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police  arrived. They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not  possibly have heard anything.    So far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save  lamentations and expressions of amazement.    Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences of  the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already told  the police. Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had escaped  by the window. The bloodstain was conclusive, in his opinion, on that  point. Besides, as the bridge was up, there was no other possible way of  escaping. He could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he  had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He could not possibly  have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place more than three  feet deep.    In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. Douglas  was a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which he  never spoke. He had emigrated to America when he was a very young man.  He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in California, where  they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called  Benito Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas had suddenly sold  out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker had  afterwards realized his money and come to live in London. Thus they had  renewed their friendship.    Douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging  over his head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from  California, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in England,  as being connected with this peril. He imagined that some secret  society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas's track, which  would never rest until it killed him. Some remarks of his had given him  this idea; though he had never told him what the society was, nor how  he had come to offend it. He could only suppose that the legend upon the  placard had some reference to this secret society.    \"How long were you with Douglas in California?\" asked Inspector  MacDonald.    \"Five years altogether.\"    \"He was a bachelor, you say?\"    \"A widower.\"    \"Have you ever heard where his first wife came from?\"    \"No, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I have  seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of typhoid  the year before I met him.\"    \"You don't associate his past with any particular part of America?\"    \"I have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew that city well and had worked  there. I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. He had  travelled a good deal in his time.\"    \"Was"]]]
