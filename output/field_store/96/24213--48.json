His horse was in much the same plight. It was a  ragged, unkempt pony, pitifully poor and very footsore, at first sight,  an absolute \"moke\"; but a second glance showed colossal round ribs,  square hips, and a great length of rein, the rest hidden beneath a  wealth of loose hair. He looked like \"a good journey horse\", possibly  something better.    We gathered round while M'Gregor questioned the drover. The man was  monosyllabic to a degree, as the real bushmen generally are. It is only  the rowdy and the town-bushy that are fluent of speech.    \"Guid mornin',\" said M'Gregor.    \"Mornin', boss,\" said the drover, shortly.    \"Is this the horrse ye hae for sale?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Ay,\" and M'Gregor looked at the pony with a businesslike  don't-think-much-of-him air, ran his hand lightly over the hard legs,  and opened the passive creature's mouth. \"H'm,\" he said. Then he turned  to the drover. \"Ye seem a bit oot o' luck. Ye're thin like. What's been  the matter?\"    \"Been sick with fever--Queensland fever. Just come through from the  North. Been out on the Diamantina last.\"    \"Ay. I was there mysel',\" said M'Gregor. \"Hae ye the fever on ye still?\"    \"Yes--goin' home to get rid of it.\"    A man can only get Queensland fever in a malarial district, but he  can carry it with him wherever he goes. If he stays, it will sap his  strength and pull him to pieces; if he moves to a better climate,  the malady moves with him, leaving him by degrees, and coming back at  regular intervals to rack, shake, burn, and sweat its victim. Gradually  it wears itself out, often wearing its patient out at the same time.  M'Gregor had been through the experience, and there was a slight change  in his voice as he went on with his palaver.    \"Whaur are ye makin' for the noo?\"    \"Monaro--my people live in Monaro.\"    \"Hoo will ye get to Monaro gin ye sell the horrse?\"    \"Coach and rail. Too sick to care about ridin',\" said the drover, while  a wan smile flitted over his yellow-grey features. \"I've rode him far  enough. I've rode that horse a thousand miles. I wouldn't sell him, only  I'm a bit hard up. Sellin' him now to get the money to go home.\"    \"Hoo auld is he?\"    \"Seven.\"    \"Is he a guid horrse on a camp?\" asked M'Gregor.    \"No better camp-horse in Queensland,\" said the drover. \"You can chuck  the reins on his neck, an' he'll cut out a beast by himself.\"    M'Gregor's action in this matter puzzled us. We spent our time crawling  after sheep, and a camp-horse would be about as much use to us as  side-pockets to a pig. We had expected Sandy to rush the fellow off the  place at once, and we couldn't understand how it was that he took  so much interest in him. Perhaps the fever-racked drover and the old  camp-horse appealed to him in a way incomprehensible to us. We had never  been on the Queensland cattle-camps, nor shaken and shivered with the  fever, nor lived the roving life of the overlanders. M'Gregor had done  all this, and his heart (I can see it all now) went out to the man who  brought the old days back to him.    \"Ah, weel,\" he said, \"we hae'na muckle use for a camp-horrse here, ye  ken; wi'oot some of these lads wad like to try theer han' cuttin'  oot the milkers' cawves frae their mithers.\" And the old man laughed  contemptuously, while we felt humbled in the sight of the man from far  back. \"An' what'll ye be wantin' for him?\" asked M'Gregor.    \"Reckon he's worth fifteen notes,\" said the drover.    This fairly staggered us. Our estimates had varied between thirty  shillings and a fiver. We thought the negotiations would close abruptly;  but M'Gregor, after a little more examination, agreed to give the price,  provided the saddle and bridle, both grand specimens of ancient art,  were given in. This was agreed to, and the drover was sent off to get  his meals in the hut before leaving by the coach.    \"The mon is verra harrd up, an' it's a sair thing that Queensland  fever,\" was the only remark M'Gregor made. But we knew now that there  was a soft spot in his heart somewhere.    Next morning the drover got a crisp-looking cheque. He said no word  while the cheque was being written, but, as he was going away, the horse  happened to be in the yard, and he went over to the old comrade that had  carried him so many miles, and laid a hand on his neck.    \"He ain't much to look at,\" said the drover, speaking slowly and  awkwardly, \"but he's white when he's wanted.\" And just before the coach  rattled off, the man of few words leant down from the box and nodded  impressively, and repeated, \"Yes, he's white when he's wanted.\"    We didn't trouble to give the new horse a name. Station horses are  generally called after the man from whom they are bought. \"Tom Devine\",  \"The Regan mare\", \"Black M'Carthy\" and \"Bay M'Carthy\" were among the  appellations of our horses at that time. As we didn't know the drover's  name, we simply called the animal \"The new horse\" until a still newer  horse was one day acquired. Then, one of the hands being told to take  the new horse, said, \"D'yer mean the _new_ new horse or the _old_ new  horse?\"    \"Naw,\" said the boss, \"not the new horrse--that bay horrse we bought  frae the drover. The ane he said was white when he's wanted.\"    And so, by degrees, the animal came to be referred to as the horse  that's white when he's wanted, and at last settled down to the definite  name of \"White-when-he's-wanted\".    White-when-he's-wanted didn't seem much of an acquisition. He was sent  out to do slavery for Greenhide Billy, a boundary-rider who plumed  himself on having once been a cattle-man. After a week's experience of  \"White\", Billy came in to the homestead disgusted. The pony was so lazy  that he had to build a fire under him to get him to move, and so rough  that it made a man's nose bleed to ride him more than a mile. \"The boss  must have been off his head to give fifteen notes for such a cow.\"    M'Gregor heard this complaint. \"Verra weel, Mr. Billy,\" said he, hotly,  \"ye can juist tak' ane of the young horrses in yon paddock, an' if he  bucks wi' ye an' kills ye, it's yer ain fault. Ye're a cattleman--so ye  say--dommed if ah believe it. Ah believe ye're a dairy-farmin' body frae  Illawarra. Ye ken neither horrse nor cattle. Mony's the time ye never  rode buckjumpers, Mr. Billy\"--and with this parting-shot the old man  turned into the house, and White-when-he's-wanted came back to the head  station.    For a while he was a sort of pariah. He used to yard the horses, fetch  up the cows, and hunt travelling sheep through the run. He really was  lazy and rough, and we all decided that Billy's opinion of him was  correct, until the day came to make one of our periodical raids on the  wild horses in the hills at the back of the run.    Every now and again we formed parties to run in some of these animals,  and, after nearly galloping to death half-a-dozen good horses, we  would capture three or four brumbies, and bring them in triumph to the  homestead to be broken in. By the time they had thrown half the crack  riders on the station, broken all the bridles, rolled on all the  saddles, and kicked all the dogs, they would be marketable (and no great  bargains) at about thirty shillings a head.    Yet there is no sport in the world to be mentioned in the same volume as  \"running horses\", and we were very keen on it. All the crack nags were  got as fit as possible, and fed up beforehand; and on this particular  occasion White-when-he's-wanted, being in good trim, was given a week's  hard feed and lent to a harum-scarum fellow from the Upper Murray, who  happened to be working in a survey camp on the run. How he did open our  eyes!    He ran the mob from hill to hill, from range to range, across open  country and back again to the hills, over flats and gullies,  through hop-scrub and stringybark ridges; and all the time  White-when-he's-wanted was on the wing of the mob, pulling double. The  mares and foals dropped out, the colts and young stock pulled up dead  beat, and only the seasoned veterans were left. Most of our horses caved  in altogether; one or two were kept in the hunt by judicious nursing and  shirking the work; but White-when-he's-wanted was with the quarry from  end to end of the run, doing double his share; and at the finish, when a  chance offered to wheel them into the trapyard, he simply smothered them  for pace, and slewed them into the wings before they knew where they  were. Such a capture had not fallen to our lot for many a day, and the  fame of White-when-he's-wanted was speedily noised abroad.    He was always fit for work, always hungry, always ready to lie down and  roll, and always lazy. But when he heard the rush of the brumbies' feet  in the scrub he became frantic with excitement. He could race over the  roughest ground without misplacing a hoof or altering his stride, and he  could sail over fallen timber and across gullies like a kangaroo. Nearly  every Sunday we were after the brumbies, until they got as lean as  greyhounds and as cunning as policemen. We were always ready to back  White-when-he's-wanted to run-down, single-handed, any animal in  the bush that we liked to put him after--wild horses, wild cattle,  kangaroos, emus, dingoes, kangaroo-rats--we barred nothing, for, if he  couldn't beat them for pace, he would outlast them.    And then one day he disappeared from the paddock, and we never saw him  again. We knew there were plenty of men in the district who would steal  him; but, as we knew also of many more who would \"inform\" for a pound  or two, we were sure that it could not have been local \"talent\" that  had taken him. We offered good rewards and set some of the right sort to  work, but heard nothing of him for about a year.    Then the surveyor's assistant turned up again, after a trip to the  interior. He told us the usual string of back-block lies, and wound up  by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#8)"],[1," and ditchwater. And thus Christianity and  morality, courage, and intellect, and art all crumbling together into  one wreck, we are hurried on to the fall of Italy, the revolution in  France, and the condition of art in England (saved by her Protestantism  from severer penalty) in the time of George II.    Sec. XXXVIII. I have not written in vain if I have heretofore done  anything towards diminishing the reputation of the Renaissance landscape  painting. But the harm which has been done by Claude and the Poussins is  as nothing when compared to the mischief effected by Palladio, Scamozzi,  and Sansovino. Claude and the Poussins were weak men, and have had no  serious influence on the general mind. There is little harm in their  works being purchased at high prices: their real influence is very  slight, and they may be left without grave indignation to their poor  mission of furnishing drawing-rooms and assisting stranded conversation.  Not so the Renaissance architecture. Raised at once into all the  magnificence of which it was capable by Michael Angelo, then taken up by  men of real intellect and imagination, such as Scamozzi, Sansovino,  Inigo Jones, and Wren, it is impossible to estimate the extent of its  influence on the European mind; and that the more, because few persons  are concerned with painting, and, of those few, the larger number  regard it with slight attention; but all men are concerned with  architecture, and have at some time of their lives serious business with  it. It does not much matter that an individual loses two or three  hundred pounds in buying a bad picture, but it is to be regretted that a  nation should lose two or three hundred thousand in raising a ridiculous  building. Nor is it merely wasted wealth or distempered conception which  we have to regret in this Renaissance architecture: but we shall find in  it partly the root, partly the expression, of certain dominant evils of  modern times--over-sophistication and ignorant classicalism; the one  destroying the healthfulness of general society, the other rendering our  schools and universities useless to a large number of the men who pass  through them.    Now Venice, as she was once the most religious, was in her fall the most  corrupt, of European states; and as she was in her strength the centre  of the pure currents of Christian architecture, so she is in her decline  the source of the Renaissance. It was the originality and splendor of  the palaces of Vicenza and Venice which gave this school its eminence in  the eyes of Europe; and the dying city, magnificent in her dissipation,  and graceful in her follies, obtained wider worship in her decrepitude  than in her youth, and sank from the midst of her admirers into the  grave.    Sec. XXXIX. It is in Venice, therefore, and in Venice only that effectual  blows can be struck at this pestilent art of the Renaissance. Destroy  its claims to admiration there, and it can assert them nowhere else.  This, therefore, will be the final purpose of the following essay. I  shall not devote a fourth section to Palladio, nor weary the reader with  successive chapters of vituperation; but I shall, in my account of the  earlier architecture, compare the forms of all its leading features with  those into which they were corrupted by the Classicalists; and pause, in  the close, on the edge of the precipice of decline, so soon as I have  made its depths discernible. In doing this I shall depend upon two  distinct kinds of evidence:--the first, the testimony borne by  particular incidents and facts to a want of thought or of feeling in the  builders; from which we may conclude that their architecture must be  bad:--the second, the sense, which I doubt not I shall be able to excite  in the reader, of a systematic ugliness in the architecture itself. Of  the first kind of testimony I shall here give two instances, which may  be immediately useful in fixing in the readers mind the epoch above  indicated for the commencement of decline.    Sec. XL. I must again refer to the importance which I have above attached  to the death of Carlo Zeno and the doge Tomaso Mocenigo. The tomb of  that doge is, as I said, wrought by a Florentine; but it is of the same  general type and feeling as all the Venetian tombs of the period, and it  is one of the last which retains it. The classical element enters  largely into its details, but the feeling of the whole is as yet  unaffected. Like all the lovely tombs of Venice and Verona, it is a  sarcophagus with a recumbent figure above, and this figure is a faithful  but tender portrait, wrought as far as it can be without painfulness, of  the doge as he lay in death. He wears his ducal robe and bonnet--his  head is laid slightly aside upon his pillow--his hands are simply  crossed as they fall. The face is emaciated, the features large, but so  pure and lordly in their natural chiselling, that they must have looked  like marble even in their animation. They are deeply worn away by  thought and death; the veins on the temples branched and starting; the  skin gathered in sharp folds; the brow high-arched and shaggy; the  eye-ball magnificently large; the curve of the lips just veiled by the  light mustache at the side; the beard short, double, and sharp-pointed:  all noble and quiet; the white sepulchral dust marking like light the  stern angles of the cheek and brow.    This tomb was sculptured in 1424, and is thus described by one of the  most intelligent of the recent writers who represent the popular feeling  respecting Venetian art.       \"Of the Italian school is also the rich but ugly (ricco ma non bel)     sarcophagus in which repose the ashes of Tomaso Mocenigo. It may be     called one of the last links which connect the declining art of the     Middle Ages with that of the Renaissance, which was in its rise. We     will not stay to particularise the defects of each of the seven     figures of the front and sides, which represent the cardinal and     theological virtues; nor will we make any remarks upon those which     stand in the niches above the pavilion, because we consider them     unworthy both of the age and reputation of the Florentine school,     which was then with reason considered the most notable in Italy.\"[24]    It is well, indeed, not to pause over these defects; but it might have  been better to have paused a moment beside that noble image of a king's  mortality.    Sec. XLI. In the choir of the same church, St. Giov. and Paolo, is another  tomb, that of the Doge Andrea Vendramin. This doge died in 1478, after a  short reign of two years, the most disastrous in the annals of Venice.  He died of a pestilence which followed the ravage of the Turks, carried  to the shores of the lagoons. He died, leaving Venice disgraced by sea  and land, with the smoke of hostile devastation rising in the blue  distances of Friuli; and there was raised to him the most costly tomb  ever bestowed on her monarchs.    Sec. XLII. If the writer above quoted was cold beside the statue of one of  the fathers of his country, he atones for it by his eloquence beside the  tomb of the Vendramin. I must not spoil the force of Italian superlative  by translation.       \"Quando si guarda a quella corretta eleganza di profili e di     proporzioni, a quella squisitezza d'ornamenti, a quel certo sapore     antico che senza ombra d'imitazione traspare da tutta l'opera\"--&c.     \"Sopra ornatissimo zoccolo fornito di squisiti intagli s'alza uno     stylobate\"--&c. \"Sotto le colonne, il predetto stilobate si muta     leggiadramente in piedistallo, poi con bella novita di pensiero e di     effetto va coronato da un fregio il piu gentile che veder si     possa\"--&c. \"Non puossi lasciar senza un cenno l'_arca dove_ sta     chiuso il doge; capo lavoro di pensiero e di esecuzione,\" &c.    There are two pages and a half of closely printed praise, of which the  above specimens may suffice; but there is not a word of the statue of the  dead from beginning to end. I am myself in the habit of considering this  rather an important part of a tomb, and I was especially interested in it  here, because Selvatico only echoes the praise of thousands. It is  unanimously declared the chef d'oeuvre of Renaissance sepulchral work,  and pronounced by Cicognara (also quoted by Selvatico)       \"Il vertice a cui l'arti Veneziane si spinsero col ministero del     scalpello,\"--\"The very culminating point to which the Venetian arts     attained by ministry of the chisel.\"    To this culminating point, therefore, covered with dust and cobwebs, I  attained, as I did to every tomb of importance in Venice, by the  ministry of such ancient ladders as were to be found in the sacristan's  keeping. I was struck at first by the excessive awkwardness and want of  feeling in the fall of the hand towards the spectator, for it is thrown  off the middle of the body in order to show its fine cutting. Now the  Mocenigo hand, severe and even stiff in its articulations, has its veins  finely drawn, its sculptor having justly felt that the delicacy of the  veining expresses alike dignity and age and birth. The Vendramin hand is  far more laboriously cut, but its blunt and clumsy contour at once makes  us feel that all the care has been thrown away, and well it may be, for  it has been entirely bestowed in cutting gouty wrinkles about the  joints. Such as the hand is, I looked for its fellow. At first I thought  it had been broken off, but, on clearing away the dust, I saw the  wretched effigy had only _one_ hand, and was a mere block on the inner  side. The face, heavy and disagreeable in its features, is made  monstrous by its semi-sculpture. One side of the forehead is wrinkled  elaborately, the other left smooth; one side only of the doge's cap is  chased; one cheek only is finished, and the other blocked out and  distorted besides; finally, the ermine robe, which is elaborately  imitated to its utmost lock of hair and"]]]
