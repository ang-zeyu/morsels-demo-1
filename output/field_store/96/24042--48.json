His eulogists, unhappily, could  not pretend that his morals had escaped untainted from the widespread  contagion of that age. Though an enemy of Popery and of arbitrary  power, he had been averse to extreme courses, had been willing, when the  Exclusion Bill was lost, to agree to a compromise, and had never  been concerned in the illegal and imprudent schemes which had brought  discredit on the Whig party. But, though regretting part of the conduct  of his friends, he had not, on that account, failed to perform zealously  the most arduous and perilous duties of friendship. He had stood near  Russell at the bar, had parted from him on the sad morning of the  execution with close embraces and with many bitter tears, nay, had  offered to manage an escape at the hazard of his own life. [28] This  great nobleman now proposed that a day should be fixed for considering  the royal speech. It was contended, on the other side, that the  Lords, by voting thanks for the speech, had precluded themselves from  complaining of it. But this objection was treated with contempt by  Halifax. \"Such thanks,\" he said with the sarcastic pleasantry in  which he excelled, \"imply no approbation. We are thankful whenever our  gracious Sovereign deigns to speak to us. Especially thankful are we  when, as on the present occasion, he speaks out, and gives us fair  warning of what we are to suffer.\" [29] Doctor Henry Compton, Bishop of  London, spoke strongly for the motion. Though not gifted with eminent  abilities, nor deeply versed in the learning of his profession, he  was always heard by the House with respect; for he was one of the few  clergymen who could, in that age, boast of noble blood. His own loyalty,  and the loyalty of his family, had been signally proved. His father,  the second Earl of Northampton, had fought bravely for King Charles the  First, and, surrounded by the parliamentary soldiers, had fallen, sword  in hand, refusing to give or take quarter. The Bishop himself, before he  was ordained, had borne arms in the Guards; and, though he generally did  his best to preserve the gravity and sobriety befitting a prelate, some  flashes of his military spirit would, to the last, occasionally break  forth. He had been entrusted with the religious education of the two  Princesses, and had acquitted himself of that important duty in a  manner which had satisfied all good Protestants, and had secured to him  considerable influence over the minds of his pupils, especially of the  Lady Anne. [30] He now declared that he was empowered to speak the sense  of his brethren, and that, in their opinion and in his own, the whole  civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the realm was in danger.    One of the most remarkable speeches of that day was made by a young man,  whose eccentric career was destined to amaze Europe. This was Charles  Mordaunt, Viscount Mordaunt, widely renowned, many years later, as Earl  of Peterborough. Already he had given abundant proofs of his courage,  of his capacity, and of that strange unsoundness of mind which made  his courage and capacity almost useless to his country. Already he had  distinguished himself as a wit and a scholar, as a soldier and a sailor.  He had even set his heart on rivalling Bourdaloue and Bossuet. Though an  avowed freethinker, he had sate up all night at sea to compose sermons,  and had with great difficulty been prevented from edifying the crew of  a man of war with his pious oratory. [31] He now addressed the House of  Peers, for the first time, with characteristic eloquence, sprightliness,  and audacity. He blamed the Commons for not having taken a bolder line.  \"They have been afraid,\" he said, \"to speak out. They have talked of  apprehensions and jealousies. What have apprehension and jealousy to do  here? Apprehension and jealousy are the feelings with which we regard  future and uncertain evils. The evil which we are considering is  neither future nor uncertain. A standing army exists. It is officered  by Papists. We have no foreign enemy. There is no rebellion in the land.  For what, then, is this force maintained, except for the purpose of  subverting our laws and establishing that arbitrary power which is so  justly abhorred by Englishmen?\" [32]    Jeffreys spoke against the motion in the coarse and savage style of  which he was a master; but he soon found that it was not quite so easy  to browbeat the proud and powerful barons of England in their own  hall, as to intimidate advocates whose bread depended on his favour  or prisoners whose necks were at his mercy. A man whose life has been  passed in attacking and domineering, whatever may be his talents and  courage, generally makes a mean figure when he is vigorously assailed,  for, being unaccustomed to stand on the defensive, he becomes confused;  and the knowledge that all those whom he has insulted are enjoying his  confusion confuses him still more. Jeffreys was now, for the first  time since he had become a great man, encountered on equal terms by  adversaries who did not fear him. To the general delight, he passed at  once from the extreme of insolence to the extreme of meanness, and could  not refrain from weeping with rage and vexation. [33] Nothing indeed was  wanting to his humiliation; for the House was crowded by about a hundred  peers, a larger number than had voted even on the great day of the  Exclusion Bill. The King, too, was present. His brother had been in the  habit of attending the sittings of the Lords for amusement, and used  often to say that a debate was as entertaining as a comedy. James came,  not to be diverted, but in the hope that his presence might impose some  restraint on the discussion. He was disappointed. The sense of the  House was so strongly manifested that, after a closing speech, of great  keenness, from Halifax, the courtiers did not venture to divide. An  early day was fixed for taking the royal speech into consideration;  and it was ordered that every peer who was not at a distance from  Westminster should be in his place. [34]    On the following morning the King came down, in his robes, to the House  of Lords. The Usher of the Black Rod summoned the Commons to the bar;  and the Chancellor announced that the Parliament was prorogued to the  tenth of February. [35] The members who had voted against the court were  dismissed from the public service. Charles Fox quitted the Pay Office.  The Bishop of London ceased to be Dean of the Chapel Royal, and his name  was struck out of the list of Privy Councillors.    The effect of the prorogation was to put an end to a legal proceeding of  the highest importance. Thomas Grey, Earl of Stamford, sprung from one  of the most illustrious houses of England, had been recently arrested  and committed close prisoner to the Tower on a charge of high treason.  He was accused of having been concerned in the Rye House Plot. A true  bill had been found against him by the grand jury of the City of London,  and had been removed into the House of Lords, the only court before  which a temporal peer can, during a session of Parliament, be arraigned  for any offence higher than a misdemeanour. The first of December had  been fixed for the trial; and orders had been given that Westminster  Hall should be fitted up with seats and hangings. In consequence of the  prorogation, the hearing of the cause was postponed for an indefinite  period; and Stamford soon regained his liberty. [36]    Three other Whigs of great eminence were in confinement when the session  closed, Charles Gerard, Lord Gerard of Brandon, eldest son of the Earl  of Macclesfield, John Hampden, grandson of the renowned leader of the  Long Parliament, and Henry Booth, Lord Delamere. Gerard and Hampden were  accused of having taken part in the Rye House Plot: Delamere of having  abetted the Western insurrection.    It was not the intention of the government to put either Gerard  or Hampden to death. Grey had stipulated for their lives before he  consented to become a witness against them. [37] But there was a still  stronger reason for sparing them. They were heirs to large property: but  their fathers were still living. The court could therefore get little in  the way of forfeiture, and might get much in the way of ransom. Gerard  was tried, and, from the very scanty accounts which have come down  to us, seems to have defended himself with great spirit and force. He  boasted of the exertions and sacrifices made by his family in the cause  of Charles the First, and proved Rumsey, the witness who had murdered  Russell by telling one story and Cornish by telling another, to be  utterly undeserving of credit. The jury, with some hesitation, found a  verdict of Guilty. After long imprisonment Gerard was suffered to redeem  himself. [38] Hampden had inherited the political opinions and a large  share of the abilities of his grandfather, but had degenerated from  the uprightness and the courage by which his grandfather had been  distinguished. It appears that the prisoner was, with cruel cunning,  long kept in an agony of suspense, in order that his family might be  induced to pay largely for mercy. His spirit sank under the terrors of  death. When brought to the bar of the Old Bailey he not only pleaded  guilty, but disgraced the illustrious name which he bore by abject  submissions and entreaties. He protested that he had not been privy  to the design of assassination; but he owned that he had meditated  rebellion, professed deep repentance for his offence, implored the  intercession of the Judges, and vowed that, if the royal clemency  were extended to him, his whole life should be passed in evincing  his gratitude for such goodness. The Whigs were furious at his  pusillanimity, and loudly declared him to be far more deserving of blame  than Grey, who, even in turning King's evidence, had preserved a certain  decorum.

What did you do next?\"    Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.  \"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher  and two more to the spot.\"    \"Was the street empty then?\"    \"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    The constable's features broadened into a grin. \"I've seen many a drunk  chap in my time,\" he said, \"but never anyone so cryin' drunk as  that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up agin the  railings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about Columbine's  New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn't stand, far less  help.\"    \"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.    John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \"He was  an uncommon drunk sort o' man,\" he said. \"He'd ha' found hisself in the  station if we hadn't been so took up.\"    \"His face--his dress--didn't you notice them?\" Holmes broke in  impatiently.    \"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up--me  and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower  part muffled round----\"    \"That will do,\" cried Holmes. \"What became of him?\"    \"We'd enough to do without lookin' after him,\" the policeman said, in an  aggrieved voice. \"I'll wager he found his way home all right.\"    \"How was he dressed?\"    \"A brown overcoat.\"    \"Had he a whip in his hand?\"    \"A whip--no.\"    \"He must have left it behind,\" muttered my companion. \"You didn't happen  to see or hear a cab after that?\"    \"No.\"    \"There's a half-sovereign for you,\" my companion said, standing up and  taking his hat. \"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the  force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You  might have gained your sergeant's stripes last night. The man whom you  held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and  whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you  that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\"    We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,  but obviously uncomfortable.    \"The blundering fool,\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our  lodgings. \"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good  luck, and not taking advantage of it.\"    \"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this  man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why  should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way  of criminals.\"    \"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no  other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I  shall have him, Doctor--I'll lay you two to one that I have him. I must  thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have  missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh?  Why shouldn't we use a little art jargon. There's the scarlet thread of  murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is  to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now  for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing  are splendid. What's that little thing of Chopin's she plays so  magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\"    Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a  lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.          CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.      OUR morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was  tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' departure for the concert, I  lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep.  It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that  had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into  it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted  baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the  impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it  difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its  owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most  malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of  Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the  depravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.    The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's  hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he  had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something  which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what  had caused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of  strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so  thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the  victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As  long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be  no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident  manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained  all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.    He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert  could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before  he appeared.    \"It was magnificent,\" he said, as he took his seat. \"Do you remember  what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and  appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of  speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced  by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries  when the world was in its childhood.\"    \"That's rather a broad idea,\" I remarked.    \"One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret  Nature,\" he answered. \"What's the matter? You're not looking quite  yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\"    \"To tell the truth, it has,\" I said. \"I ought to be more case-hardened  after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at  Maiwand without losing my nerve.\"    \"I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the  imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you  seen the evening paper?\"    \"No.\"    \"It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the  fact that when the man was raised up, a woman's wedding ring fell upon  the floor. It is just as well it does not.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Look at this advertisement,\" he answered. \"I had one sent to every  paper this morning immediately after the affair.\"    He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It  was the first announcement in the \"Found\" column. \"In Brixton Road,  this morning,\" it ran, \"a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway  between the 'White Hart' Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,  221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\"    \"Excuse my using your name,\" he said. \"If I used my own some of these  dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\"    \"That is all right,\" I answered. \"But supposing anyone applies, I have  no ring.\"    \"Oh yes, you have,\" said he, handing me one. \"This will do very well. It  is almost a facsimile.\"    \"And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\"    \"Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.  If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\"    \"Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\"    \"Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason  to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the  ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber's  body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he  discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in  possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had  to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have  been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that  man's place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him  that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving  the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the  evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His  eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should  he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding  of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will  come. You shall see him within an hour?\"    \"And then?\" I asked.    \"Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\"    \"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\"    \"You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man,  and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for  anything.\"    I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with  the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his  favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.    \"The plot thickens,\" he said, as I entered; \"I have just had an answer  to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\"    \"And that is?\" I asked eagerly.    \"My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\" he remarked. \"Put your  pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary  way. Leave the rest to me. Don't frighten him by looking at him too  hard.\"    \"It is eight o'clock now,\" I said, glancing at my watch.    \"Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.  That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a  queer old book I picked up at a"]]]
