[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#8)"],[1," been in England, as one of the Agents of the Colony  of Massachusetts, for several years, in the last part of the reign of  James II. and the beginning of that of William and Mary, covering much  of the period between the abrogation of the first Charter and the  establishment of the Province under the second Charter. Circumstances  had conspired to give him great influence in organizing the Government  provided for in the new Charter. His son describes him as \"one that,  besides a station in the Church of God, as considerable as any that his  own country can afford, hath for divers years come off with honor, in  his application to three crowned heads and the chiefest nobility of  three kingdoms.\"    Being satisfied that a restoration of the old Charter could not be  obtained, Increase Mather acquiesced in what he deemed a necessity, and  bent his efforts to have as favorable terms as possible secured in the  new. His colleagues in the agency, Elisha Cooke and Thomas Oaks, opposed  his course--the former, with great determination, taking the ground of  the \"old Charter or none.\" This threw them out of all communication with  the Home Government, on the subject, and gave to Mr. Mather controlling  influence. He was requested by the Ministers of the Crown to name the  officers of the new Government; and, in fact, had the free and sole  selection of them all. Sir William Phips was appointed Governor, at his  solicitation; and, in accordance with earnest recommendations, in a  letter from Cotton Mather, William Stoughton was appointed  Deputy-governor, thereby superceding Danforth, one of the ablest men in  the Province. In fact, every member of the Council owed his seat to the  Mathers, and, politically, was their creature. Great was the exultation  of Cotton Mather, when the intelligence reached him, thus expressed in  his Diary: \"The time for favor is now come, yea, the set-time is come. I  am now to receive the answers of so many prayers, as have been employed  for my absent parent, and the deliverance and settlement of my poor  country. We have not the former Charter, but we have a better in the  room of it; one which much better suits our circumstances. And, instead  of my being made a sacrifice to wicked rulers, all the Councillors of  the Province are of my father's nomination; and my father-in-law, with  several related to me, and several brethren of my own Church, are among  them. The Governor of the Province is not my enemy, but one whom I  baptized, namely, Sir William Phips, and one of my flock, and one of my  dearest friends.\"    The whole number of Councillors was twenty-eight, three of them, at  least, being of the Mather Church. John Phillips was Cotton Mather's  father-in-law. Two years before, Sir William Phips had been baptized by  Cotton Mather, in the presence of the congregation, and received into  the Church.    The \"set-time,\" so long prayed for, was of brief duration. The  influence of the Mathers over the politics of the Province was limited  to the first part of Phips's short administration. At the very next  election, in May, 1693, ten of the Councillors were left out; and Elisha  Cooke, their great opponent, was chosen to that body, although negatived  by Phips, in the exercise of his prerogative, under the Charter.    Increase Mather came over in the same ship with the Governor, the  _Nonsuch_, frigate. As Phips was his parishioner, owed to him his  office, and was necessarily thrown into close intimacy, during the long  voyage, he fell naturally under his influence, which, all things  considered, could not have failed to be controlling. The Governor was an  illiterate person, but of generous, confiding, and susceptible impulses;  and the elder Mather was precisely fitted to acquire an ascendency over  such a character. He had been twice abroad, in his early manhood and in  his later years, had knowledge of the world, been conversant with  learned men in Colleges and among distinguished Divines and Statesmen,  and seen much of Courts and the operations of Governments. With a more  extended experience and observation than his son, his deportment was  more dignified, and his judgment infinitely better; while his talents  and acquirements were not far, if at all, inferior. When Phips landed in  Boston, it could not, therefore, have been otherwise than that he should  pass under the control of the Mathers, the one accompanying, the other  meeting him on the shore. They were his religious teachers and guides;  by their efficient patronage and exertions he had been placed in his  high office. They, his Deputy, Stoughton, and the whole class of persons  under their influence, at once gathered about him, gave him his first  impressions, and directed his movements. By their talents and position,  the Mathers controlled the people, and kept open a channel through which  they could reach the ear of Royalty. The Government of the Province was  nominally in Phips and his Council, but the Mathers were a power behind  the throne greater than the throne itself. The following letter, never  before published, for which I am indebted to Abner C. Goodell, Esq.,  Vice-president of the Essex Institute, shows how they bore themselves  before the Legislature, and communicated with the Home Government.        \"MY LORD:        \"I have only to assure your Lordship, that the generality of their      Majesties subjects (so far as I can understand) do, with all      thankfulness, receive the favors, which, by the new Charter, are      granted to them. The last week, the General Assembly (which, your      Lordship knows, is our New England Parliament) convened at Boston.      I did then exhort them to make an Address of thanks to their      Majesties; which, I am since informed, the Assembly have unanimously      agreed to do, as in duty they are bound. I have also acquainted the      whole Assembly, how much, not myself only, but they, and all this      Province, are obliged to your Lordship in particular, which they      have a grateful sense of, as by letters from themselves your      Lordship will perceive. If I may, in any thing, serve their      Majesties interest here, I shall, on that account, think myself      happy, and shall always study to approve myself, My Lord,                                          \"Your most humble, thankful                                                  and obedient Servant,                                                        INCREASE MATHER.        \"BOSTON, N. E.      June 23, 1692.        \"To the Rt. Hon^ble the _Earl of Nottingham_, his Maj^ties Principal      Secretary of State at Whitehall.\"    While they could thus address the General Assembly, and the Ministers of  State, in London, the Government here was, as Hutchinson evidently  regarded it, [_i., 365; ii., 69._] \"a MATHER ADMINISTRATION.\" It was  \"short, sharp, and decisive.\" It opened in great power; its course was  marked with terror and havoc; it ended with mysterious suddenness; and  its only monument is Salem Witchcraft--the \"_judicial murder_,\" as the  Reviewer calls it, of twenty men and women, as innocent in their lives  as they were heroic in their deaths.    The _Nonsuch_ arrived in Boston harbor, towards the evening of the  fourteenth of May, 1692. Judge Sewall's Diary, now in the possession of  the Massachusetts Historical Society, has this entry, at the above date.  \"Candles are lighted before he gets into Town House, 8 companies wait on  him to his house, and then on Mr. Mather to his, made no vollies,  because 'twas Saturday night.\"    The next day, the Governor attended, we may be sure, public worship with  the congregation to which he belonged; and the occasion was undoubtedly  duly noticed. After so long an absence, Increase Mather could not have  failed to address his people, the son also taking part in the  interesting service. The presence, in his pew, of the man who, a short  time before, had been regenerated by their preaching, and now  re-appeared among them with the title and commission of Governor of New  England, added to the previous honors of Knighthood, at once suggested  to all, and particularly impressed upon him, an appreciating conviction  of the political triumph, as well as clerical achievement, of the  associate Ministers of the North Boston Church. From what we know of the  state of the public mind at that time, as emphatically described in a  document I am presently to produce, there can be no question as to one  class of topics and exhortations, wherewithal his Excellency and the  crowded congregation were, that day, entertained.    Monday, the sixteenth, was devoted to the ceremonies of the public  induction of the new Government. There was a procession to the  Town-house, where the Commissions of the Governor and Deputy-governor,  with the Charter under which they were appointed, were severally read  aloud to the people. A public dinner followed; and, at its close, Sir  William was escorted to his residence. At the meeting of the Council,  the next day, the seventeenth, the oaths of office having been  administered, all round, it was voted \"that there be a general meeting  of the Council upon Tuesday next, the twenty-fourth of May current, in  Boston, at two o'clock, post-meridian, to nominate and appoint Judges,  Justices, and other officers of the Council and Courts of Justice within  this their Majesties' Province belonging, and that notice thereof, or  summons, be forthwith issued unto the members of the Council now  absent.\"    The following letter from Sir William Phips, to the Government at home,  recently procured from England by Mr. Goodell, was published in the last  volume of the _Collections of the Essex Institute_--Volume IX., Part II.  I print it, entire, and request the reader to examine it, carefully, and  to refer to it as occasion arises in this discussion, as it is a key to  the whole transaction of the Witchcraft trials. Its opening sentence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#8)"],[1,"was, outside the town, and, having been held a prisoner  once in their Customs building, could point that out too. Next morning  we stood slowly in for Um-Lejj with the steam-cutter groping ahead for  the channel, which is about as tortuous a piece of navigation as you can  get off this coast, and that is saying a good deal.    When we cleared for action I went to my usual post on the bridge with  the S.N.O. and took my fisherman-friend with me. The civil population  was streaming out of the town across the open plain in all directions  like ants from an over-turned ant-hill, probably realising that we meant  business this time. This was all to the good, as otherwise I should have  had to go close in with the steam-cutter, a white flag and a megaphone  to warn Arab civilians; thus giving the Turks time to clear, besides the  chance of a sitting-shot at us if they thought my address to the  townsfolk a violation of the rules of war, which, technically, it might  be.    However, the fort was a fixture and our business was first of all with  it. Standing close in, the ship turned southwards and moved slowly  abreast of the town. The port battery of four-point-sevens loaded with  H.E. and the two six-inchers fore and aft swung out-board and followed  suit. The occasion called for fine shooting, as a minaret rose just to  the right of the fort, and the houses were so massed about it that there  was only one clear shot--up the street leading from the beach past the  main gate.    \"At the southern gate of the fort, each gun to fire as it comes to bear  up the street from the water-side.\"    As I turned my glasses on the big portico of the southern gate, out  stepped a Turkish officer who regarded us intently; the next instant the  bridge shook to the crashing concussion of our forward six-inch, and  through a drifting haze of gas-fume I saw him blotted out by the orange  flash of lyddite and an up-flung pall of dust and _debris_.    There was a pause, cut short by the clap of the bursting shell  reverberating like thunder against the foot-hills beyond the town.    A little naked boy ran in an attitude of terrified dismay up the  water-street just as the first four-point-seven fired. I saw him through  my glasses duck his head between his arms, then dive panic-stricken  through a doorway as the fort was smitten again in dust and thunder.  \"Was the poor little beggar hit?\"    \"No, sir, only scared.\"    While the target was still veiled in its dust the second four-point-seven  spoke, and the minaret disappeared from view behind a dun-coloured  shroud.    \"Cease fire\" sounded at once. \"Who fired that gun? Take him off,\" came  in tones of stern rebuke from the bridge. Luckily the minaret showed  intact as the dust drifted clear and firing continued.    As the fort crumbled under our guns, Turkish soldiers began to break  cover at various points of the town and fled across the plain. The  cutter, in-shore, opened with Maxim-fire, and so accurately that we  could see the sombre-clad figures lying here and there or seeking  frantically for cover, while an Arab in their vicinity, leading a  leisurely camel, continued his stroll inland unperturbed. We drove the  main body out of their hidden position and into the hills with  well-timed shrapnel, and finished up by demolishing the Customs (where a  lot of ammunition blew up), to the temporary satisfaction of my  fisherman, who was curled up in a corner of the bridge, nearly stunned  by the shock of modern ordnance in spite of the cotton-wool I had made  him put in his ears. Before we picked up our cutter the civil population  was already streaming back.    The incident is worth noting in view of remarks made by a popular  fiction-monger in one of his latest works, that indiscriminate aerial  raids on civil centres in England are on the same level of humanity as  naval bombardments.    I visited the fishing-banks off Hasani Island a week or so after to get  the latest news of Um-Lejj, which came from Turkish sources. There was  one civilian casualty--a woman who was in the Turkish concealed  position. No casualties among Turkish officers, but one of them left in  charge of the fort had disappeared. There were bits of the fort left,  but the Commandant had moved his headquarters to the school-house within  the precincts of the mosque--sagacious soul. The object-lesson which we  gave the Arabs at Um-Lejj put a check to their irresponsible sniping of  boats and landing-parties, though one could always expect a little  trouble with an Arab dhow running contraband for the Turks. In these  cases their guilty consciences usually gave them away. Returning to the  coast toward Jeddah unexpectedly, having played the well-worn ruse of  \"the cat's away,\" we sighted a small dhow close in-shore, and should  have left her alone as she was in shoal-water, but, on standing in to  get a nearer view of her, she headed promptly for the beach and ran  aground, disgorging more men than such a craft should carry.    I went away in the duty cutter to investigate, and we had barely  realised that she was heavily loaded with kerosene in tins (a heinous  contraband) when the fact was emphasised by a sputtering rifle-fire from  the scrub along the beach. The ship very soon put a stop to that  demonstration with a round or two of shrapnel, while we busied ourselves  with the dhow. There was no hope of salving her, as she had almost  ripped the keel off her when she took the ground and sat on the bottom  like a dilapidated basket. We broached enough tins to start a  conflagration, lit a fuse made of a strip of old turban soaked in  kerosene, and backed hard from her vicinity, for the kerosene was  low-flash common stuff as marked on the cases, and to play at snapdragon  in half an acre of blazing oil is an uninviting pastime. However, she  just flared without exploding, and we continued our cruise up the coast  just in time to overhaul at racing speed a perfect regatta of dhows  heeling over to every stitch of canvas in their efforts to make Jeddah  before we could get at them, for they had seen the smoke of that burning  oil-dhow and realised that the cat was about. Good money is paid at  Cowes to see no more spirited sailing--we had to put a shot across the  bows of the leading dhow before they would abandon the race.    There was always trouble off Jeddah--the approaches to that reef-girt  harbour lend themselves to blockade-running dhows with sound local  knowledge on board. At night, especially, they had an advantage and  would play \"Puss-in-the-Corner\" until the cutter lost patience, and a  flickering pin-point of light stabbed the velvet black of the middle  watch, asking permission to fire; one rifle-shot fired high would stop  the game, and I made them come alongside and take a wigging for annoying  the cutter and turning me out; there was seldom anything wrong about the  dhow--it was sheer cussedness.    All through the early part of 1916 we were keeping in touch with the  Sharif of Mecca by means of envoys, whom we landed where they listed,  away from the Turks, picking them up at times and places indicated by  them. Sharif Husein had long chafed under Turkish suzerainty, in spite  of his subsidy and the deference which policy compelled them to accord  him. He knew that the Hejaz could never realise its legitimate  aspirations under Ottoman rule, which was a blight on all Arab progress  and prosperity, as the Young Turkish party was hardly Moslem at heart,  being more national (that is Tartar)--certainly not pro-Arab.    Husein's difficulty was to get his own people to rise together and throw  off the Turkish yoke, for the Hejazi tribesman, especially between the  coast and Mecca, has long been more of a brigand than a warrior, as any  pilgrim will tell you. Such folk are apt to jib at hammer-and-tongs  fighting, and of course we could not land troops to assist them, as it  would have violated the sacred soil that cradled Islam and merely  stiffened the bogus _jihad_ which the Turks had proclaimed against us,  besides compromising the Sharif with his own tribesmen.    The Hejazis' ingenuous idea was to go on taking money from us, the Turks  and the Sharif, while--thanks to our lenient blockade--a regular  dhow-traffic fed them. We did not approve of this Utopian policy, and  the fall of Kut brought matters to a climax. After certain  communications had passed between the representatives of His Majesty's  Government and the Sharif, it was decided to tighten the blockade and so  induce the gentle Hejazi to declare himself. The day was fixed, May, 15,  on and after which date no traffic whatever was to be permitted with the  Arabian coast other than that specially sanctioned by Government. In  palaver thereon I managed to get local fishing-craft exempted. The  fisher-folk are not combatants either on empty stomachs or full ones,  and could be relied on to consume their own fish in that climate unless  very close to a market, where the pinch would be great enough to make  them exchange it for foodstuffs, thus helping the situation we wished to  bring about. I knew that all _bona fide_ fishing-craft were easily  recognisable by their rig and comparatively small size, and hoped that  good will would combine with freedom of movement to make these folk  useful agents for Intelligence.    I heard with some relief that the movements of the patrol would place  H.M.S. \"Hardinge\" (a roomy ship of the Indian Marine) on station duty  off Jeddah, which was to be my post while the enhanced blockade was in  force--there are few more trying seasons than early summer in those  waters. I joined her from Suez the day after the blockade was closed,  and found her keeping guard over a perfect fleet of dhows. There were  about three dozen craft with over three hundred people on board, for  many native passengers were trying to make Jeddah before we shut down.  The feckless mariners in charge had made the usual"]]]
