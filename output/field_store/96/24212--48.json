Six burghers lost their  lives in the skirmish.    The Uitlanders have been severely criticised for not having sent out a  force to help Jameson in his difficulties, but it is impossible to see  how they could have acted in any other manner. They had done all they  could to prevent Jameson coming to their relief, and now it was rather  unreasonable to suppose that they should relieve their reliever. Indeed,  they had an entirely exaggerated idea of the strength of the force which  he was bringing, and received the news of his capture with incredulity.  When it became confirmed they rose, but in a halfhearted fashion  which was not due to want of courage, but to the difficulties of their  position. On the one hand, the British Government disowned Jameson  entirely, and did all it could to discourage the rising; on the other,  the President had the raiders in his keeping at Pretoria, and let it  be understood that their fate depended upon the behaviour of the  Uitlanders. They were led to believe that Jameson would be shot unless  they laid down their arms, though, as a matter of fact, Jameson and  his people had surrendered upon a promise of quarter. So skillfully did  Kruger use his hostages that he succeeded, with the help of the British  Commissioner, in getting the thousands of excited Johannesburgers to  lay down their arms without bloodshed. Completely out-manoeuvred by the  astute old President, the leaders of the reform movement used all their  influence in the direction of peace, thinking that a general amnesty  would follow; but the moment that they and their people were helpless  the detectives and armed burghers occupied the town, and sixty of their  number were hurried to Pretoria Gaol.    To the raiders themselves the President behaved with great generosity.  Perhaps he could not find it in his heart to be harsh to the men who  had managed to put him in the right and won for him the sympathy of the  world. His own illiberal and oppressive treatment of the newcomers was  forgotten in the face of this illegal inroad of filibusters. The true  issues were so obscured by this intrusion that it has taken years  to clear them, and perhaps they will never be wholly cleared. It was  forgotten that it was the bad government of the country which was the  real cause of the unfortunate raid. From then onwards the government  might grow worse and worse, but it was always possible to point to  the raid as justifying everything. Were the Uitlanders to have the  franchise? How could they expect it after the raid? Would Britain object  to the enormous importation of arms and obvious preparations for war?  They were only precautions against a second raid. For years the raid  stood in the way, not only of all progress, but of all remonstrance.  Through an action over which they had no control, and which they had  done their best to prevent, the British Government was left with a bad  case and a weakened moral authority.    The raiders were sent home, where the rank and file were very properly  released, and the chief officers were condemned to terms of imprisonment  which certainly did not err upon the side of severity. Cecil Rhodes was  left unpunished, he retained his place in the Privy Council, and his  Chartered Company continued to have a corporate existence. This was  illogical and inconclusive. As Kruger said, 'It is not the dog which  should be beaten, but the man who set him on to me.' Public opinion--in  spite of, or on account of, a crowd of witnesses--was ill informed upon  the exact bearings of the question, and it was obvious that as Dutch  sentiment at the Cape appeared already to be thoroughly hostile to us,  it would be dangerous to alienate the British Africanders also by  making a martyr of their favourite leader. But whatever arguments may be  founded upon expediency, it is clear that the Boers bitterly resented,  and with justice, the immunity of Rhodes.    In the meantime, both President Kruger and his burghers had shown a  greater severity to the political prisoners from Johannesburg than to  the armed followers of Jameson. The nationality of these prisoners is  interesting and suggestive. There were twenty-three Englishmen, sixteen  South Africans, nine Scotchmen, six Americans, two Welshmen, one  Irishman, one Australian, one Hollander, one Bavarian, one Canadian,  one Swiss, and one Turk. The prisoners were arrested in January, but the  trial did not take place until the end of April. All were found guilty  of high treason. Mr. Lionel Phillips, Colonel Rhodes (brother of Mr.  Cecil Rhodes), George Farrar, and Mr. Hammond, the American engineer,  were condemned to death, a sentence which was afterwards commuted to the  payment of an enormous fine. The other prisoners were condemned to two  years' imprisonment, with a fine of 2000 pounds each. The imprisonment  was of the most arduous and trying sort, and was embittered by the  harshness of the gaoler, Du Plessis. One of the unfortunate men cut  his throat, and several fell seriously ill, the diet and the sanitary  conditions being equally unhealthy. At last at the end of May all the  prisoners but six were released. Four of the six soon followed, two  stalwarts, Sampson and Davies, refusing to sign any petition and  remaining in prison until they were set free in 1897. Altogether the  Transvaal Government received in fines from the reform prisoners the  enormous sum of 212,000 pounds. A certain comic relief was immediately  afterwards given to so grave an episode by the presentation of a bill to  Great Britain for 1,677, 938 pounds 3 shillings and 3 pence--the greater  part of which was under the heading of moral and intellectual damage.    The raid was past and the reform movement was past, but the causes which  produced them both remained. It is hardly conceivable that a statesman  who loved his country would have refrained from making some effort to  remove a state of things which had already caused such grave dangers,  and which must obviously become more serious with every year that  passed. But Paul Kruger had hardened his heart, and was not to be moved.  The grievances of the Uitlanders became heavier than ever. The one  power in the land to which they had been able to appeal for some sort  of redress amid their grievances was the law courts. Now it was decreed  that the courts should be dependent on the Volksraad. The Chief Justice  protested against such a degradation of his high office, and he was  dismissed in consequence without a pension. The judge who had condemned  the reformers was chosen to fill the vacancy, and the protection of a  fixed law was withdrawn from the Uitlanders.    A commission appointed by the State was sent to examine into the  condition of the mining industry and the grievances from which the  newcomers suffered. The chairman was Mr. Schalk Burger, one of the most  liberal of the Boers, and the proceedings were thorough and impartial.  The result was a report which amply vindicated the reformers, and  suggested remedies which would have gone a long way towards satisfying  the Uitlanders. With such enlightened legislation their motives for  seeking the franchise would have been less pressing. But the President  and his Raad would have none of the recommendations of the commission.  The rugged old autocrat declared that Schalk Burger was a traitor to  his country for having signed such a document, and a new reactionary  committee was chosen to report upon the report. Words and papers were  the only outcome of the affair. No amelioration came to the newcomers.  But at least they had again put their case publicly upon record, and it  had been endorsed by the most respected of the burghers. Gradually in  the press of the English-speaking countries the raid was ceasing to  obscure the issue. More and more clearly it was coming out that no  permanent settlement was possible where the majority of the population  was oppressed by the minority. They had tried peaceful means and failed.  They had tried warlike means and failed. What was there left for them  to do? Their own country, the paramount power of South Africa, had never  helped them. Perhaps if it were directly appealed to it might do so. It  could not, if only for the sake of its own imperial prestige, leave its  children for ever in a state of subjection. The Uitlanders determined  upon a petition to the Queen, and in doing so they brought their  grievances out of the limits of a local controversy into the broader  field of international politics. Great Britain must either protect them  or acknowledge that their protection was beyond her power. A direct  petition to the Queen praying for protection was signed in April 1899 by  twenty-one thousand Uitlanders. From that time events moved inevitably  towards the one end. Sometimes the surface was troubled and sometimes  smooth, but the stream always ran swiftly and the roar of the fall  sounded ever louder in the ears.        CHAPTER 3. THE NEGOTIATIONS.    The British Government and the British people do not desire any direct  authority in South Africa. Their one supreme interest is that the  various States there should live in concord and prosperity, and that  there should be no need for the presence of a British redcoat within the  whole great peninsula. Our foreign critics, with their misapprehension  of the British colonial system, can never realise that whether  the four-coloured flag of the Transvaal or the Union Jack of a  self-governing colony waved over the gold mines would not make the  difference of one shilling to the revenue of Great Britain. The  Transvaal as a British province would have its own legislature, its  own revenue, its own expenditure, and its own tariff against the mother"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30691"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science, December 1930 (#8)"],[1,"seat themselves in the semicircle of chairs. And not till then  did they so much as glance at the men waiting there before them--the two  Earth-men, standing in silent, impassive contemplation of the brilliant  scene and with their arms held quiet at their sides. Then every eye  turned full upon the captives, and if McGuire had seen deadly  malevolence in the face of their captor he found it a hundred-fold in  the inhuman faces that looked down upon them now.    The inquiring mind of Professor Sykes did not fail to note the  character of their reception. \"But why,\" he asked in whispers of his  fellow-prisoner, \"--why this open hatred of us? What possible animus  can they have against the earth or its people?\"    The figure on the throne voiced a curt order; the one who had brought  them stepped forward. His voice was raised in the same discordant,  singing tone that leaped and wandered from note to note. It conveyed  ideas--that was apparent; it was a language that he spoke. And the  central figure above nodded a brief assent as he finished.    Their captor took an arm of each in his long fingers and pushed them  roughly forward to stand alone before the battery of hard eyes.           *       *       *       *       *    Now the crowned figure addressed them directly. His voice quavered  sharply in what seemed an interrogation. The men looked blankly at each  other.    Again the voice questioned them impatiently. Sykes and McGuire were  silent. Then the young flyer took an involuntary step forward and looked  squarely at the owner of the harsh voice.    \"We don't know what you are saying,\" he began, \"and I suppose that our  lingo makes no sense to you--\" He paused in helpless wonderment as to  what he could say. Then--    \"But what the devil is it all about?\" he demanded explosively. \"Why all  the dirty looks? You've got us here as prisoners--now what do you expect  us to do? Whatever it is, you'll have to quit singing it and talk  something we can understand.\"    He knew his words were useless, but this reception was getting on his  nerves--and his arm still tingled where the scarlet one had gripped  him.    It seemed, though, that his meaning was not entirely lost. His words  meant nothing to them, but his tone must have carried its own message.  There were sharp exclamations from the seated circle. The one who had  brought them sprang forward with outstretched, clutching hands; his face  was a blood-red blotch. McGuire was waiting in crouching tenseness that  made the red one pause.    \"You touch me again,\" said the waiting man, \"and I'll knock you into an  outside loop.\"    The attacker's indecision was ended by a loud order from above. McGuire  turned as if he had been spoken to by the leader on the throne. The thin  figure was leaning far forward; his eye were boring into those of the  lieutenant, and he held the motionless pose for many minutes. To the  angry man, staring back and upward, there came a peculiar optical  illusion.    The evil face was vanishing in a shifting cloud that dissolved and  reformed, as he watched, into pictures. He knew it was not there, the  thing he saw; he knew he was regarding something as intangible as  thought; but he got the significance of every detail.    He saw himself and Professor Sykes; they were being crushed like ants  beneath a tremendous heel; he knew that the foot that could grind out  their lives was that of the one on the throne.           *       *       *       *       *    The cloud-stuff melted to new forms that grew clearer to show him the  earth. A distorted Earth--and he knew the distortion came from the mind  of the being before him who had never seen the earth at first hand; yet  he knew it for his own world. It was turning in space; he saw oceans and  continents; and before his mental gaze he saw the land swarming with  these creatures of Venus. The one before him was in command; he was  seated on an enormous throne; there were Earth people like Sykes and  himself who crept humbly before him, while fleets of great Venusian  ships hovered overhead.    The message was plain--plain as if written in words of fire in the brain  of the man. McGuire knew that these creatures intended that the vision  should be true--they meant to conquer the earth. The slim, khaki-clad  figure of Lieutenant McGuire quivered with the strength of his refusal  to accept the truth of what he saw. He shook his head to clear it of  these thought wraiths.    \"Not--in--a--million--years!\" he said, and he put behind his words all  the mental force at his command. \"Try that, old top, and they'll give  you the fight of your life--\" He checked his words as he saw plainly  that the thin cruel face that stared and stared was getting nothing from  his reply.    \"Now what do you think about that?\" he demanded of Professor Sykes. \"He  got an idea across to me--some form of telepathy. I saw his mind, or I  saw what he wanted me to see of it. It's taps, he says, for us, and then  they think they're going across and annex the world.\"    He glanced upward again and laughed loudly for the benefit of those who  were watching him so closely. \"Fine chance!\" he said; \"a fat chance!\"  But in the deeper recesses of his mind he was shaken.    For themselves there was no hope. Well, that was all in a lifetime. But  the other--the conquest of the earth--he had to try with all his power  of will to keep from his mind the pictures of destruction these beastly  things could bring about.           *       *       *       *       *    The chief of this strange council made a gesture of contempt with the  grotesque hands that were so translucent yet ashy-pale against his  scarlet robe, and the down-drawn thin lips reflected the thoughts that  prompted it. The open opposition of Lieutenant McGuire failed to impress  him, it seemed. At a word the one who had brought them sprang forward.    He addressed himself to the circle of men, and he harangued them  mightily in harsh discordance. He pointed one lean hand at the two  captives, then beat it upon his own chest. \"They are mine,\" he was  saying, as the men knew plainly. And they realized as if the weird talk  came like words to their ears that this monster was demanding that the  captives be given him.    An exchange of dismayed glances, and \"Not so good!\" said McGuire under  his breath; \"Simon Legree is asking for his slaves. Mean, ugly devil,  that boy!\"    The lean figures on the platform were bending forward, an expression of  mirth--distorted, animal smiles--upon their flabby lips. They  represented to the humans, so helpless before them, a race of thinking  things in whom no last vestige of kindness or decency remained. But was  there an exception? One of the circle was standing; the one beside them  was sullenly silent as the other on the platform addressed their ruler.    He spoke at some length, not with the fire and vehemence of the one who  had claimed them, but more quietly and dispassionately, and his cold  eyes, when they rested on those of McGuire and Sykes, seemed more  crafty than actively ablaze with malevolent ill-will. Plainly it was the  councilor now, addressing his superior. His inhuman voice was silenced  by a reply from the one on the throne.    He motioned--this gold-crowned figure of personified evil--toward the  two men, and his hand swept on toward the one who had spoken. He intoned  a command in harsh gutturals that ended in a sibilant shriek. And the  two standing silent and hopeless exchanged looks of despair.    They were being delivered to this other--that much was plain--but that  it boded anything but captivity and torment they could not believe. That  last phrase was too eloquent of hissing hate.           *       *       *       *       *    The creature rose, tall and ungainly, from his throne; amid the  salutations of his followers he turned and vanished through the arch.  The others of his council followed, all but the one. He motioned to the  two men to come with him, and the sullen one who had demanded the men  for himself obeyed an order from this councilor who was his superior.    He snapped an order, and four of his men ranged themselves about the  captives as a guard. Thin metal cords were whipped about the wrists of  each; their hands were tied. The wire cut like a knife-edge if they  strained against it.    The new director of their destinies was vanishing through an exit at one  side of the great hall; their guard hustled them after. A corridor  opened before them to end in a gold-lit portal; it was daylight out  beyond where a street was filled with hurrying figures in many colors.  With quavering shrieks they scattered like frightened fowls as an  airship descended between the tall buildings that reflected its passing  in opalescent hues.    It was a small craft compared with the one that had brought them, and  it swept down to settle lightly upon the street with no least regard  for those who might be crushed by its descent. Consideration for their  fellows did not appear as a marked characteristic of this strange  people, McGuire observed thoughtfully. They swarmed in endless droves,  these multicolored beings who made of the thoroughfare an ever-changing  kaleidoscope--and what was a life or two, more or less, among so many?  He found no comfort for themselves in the thought.    Shoulder to shoulder, the two followed where the scarlet figure of the  councilor moved toward the waiting ship. Only the professor paid further  heed to their surroundings; he marveled aloud at the numbers of the  people.    \"Hundreds of them,\" he said; \"thousands! They are swarming everywhere  like rats. Horrible!\" His eyes passed on to the buildings in their glory  of delicate hues, as he added, \"And the contrast they make with their  surroundings! It is all wrong some way; I wish I knew--\"    They were in the ship when McGuire replied. \"I hope we live long enough  to satisfy your curiosity,\" he said grimly.    The ship"]]]
