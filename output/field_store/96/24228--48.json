[G] Lallemand and Wilson, page 192.    It is distressing to see what a complete wreck seminal losses make of  those who were once robust and healthy young men, and what a shock they  give to the nervous system. They become weak, pale, and feeble in mind,  while all that was manly and vigorous has gone out of them. Now which of  the two is preferable--the pride of a virtuous youth, or the roue  exhausted and worn out by sexual abuses? It demands great strength to  become either, but really a much greater effort for the latter; because  it requires very great perseverance for a chaste and pure minded man to  debase himself by such practices. It depends on the mind which is all  right before yielding the first point; therefore beware and shun the  first step downward. Strengthen the moral courage and exercise the will  power so as always to be able to say, \"No,\" to whatever temptation the  conscience tells you is wrong.          CHAPTER V.    Adolescence of the Female.      Adolescence of the female embraces the period of life from the age of  twelve or fourteen, to twenty-one years.    At about the twelfth or fourteenth year of the girl's life a marked  change comes over her form, features and mental state. Unlike the male,  the forms which in him are angular, become in her rounded, symmetrical  and beautiful, and the characteristic feminine proportions are well  marked; she becomes more graceful in her movements, her voice grows  sweeter, more mellow, more powerful and capable of registering a higher  tone. New feelings and desires are awakened in her mind. Her deportment  becomes more commanding and less frivolous, and the girl is lost in the  woman.    If she has been so fortunate as to have escaped all the dangers and  baneful influences of infantile and childhood life, she is womanly  indeed, and we behold her with an unburdened conscience, clear  intellect, artless and candid address, good memory, buoyant spirits,  a complexion bright, clear and, as the poet declares, \"beautiful  exceedingly.\" Every function of her body is well performed, and no  fatigue is experienced after moderate exertion. She evinces that  elasticity of spirit and gracefulness of body, and happy control of her  feelings which indicate healthfulness of both mind and body. Her whole  time is given up to her studies, duties and amusements; and as she feels  her stature increase and her intellect enlarge, she gladly prepares for  her coming struggle with the world--though in a manner becoming to her  sex. This, too, is no fanciful sketch, but is realized in thousands of  cases every year. It is one which parents feel proud to witness in a  daughter, and one in which the daughter takes a modest delight. We have  said that every function of her body is well performed. The functions of  the female body, which in a state of health are perfectly free from  pain, are very numerous and, in the four years from fourteen to  eighteen, she accomplishes an amount of physiological cell change and  growth which Nature does not require of a boy in less than twice that  number of years. It is obvious, therefore, that a girl upon whom Nature,  for a limited period and for a definite purpose, imposes so great a  physiological task, will not have as much power left for the tasks of  school as a boy, of whom Nature requires less at the corresponding  epoch. The functions of circulation, respiration, digestion,  perspiration, nutrition and menstruation, though involuntary, are all  important, dependent one upon another, and all develop at the proper  time. Puberty is the proper time for the appearance of menstruation, one  of the most important and sacred of her functions. It should not be  feared, dreaded or regarded as a nuisance; it forms a part of herself;  and she never commands the respect and forbearance of her friends, or  even of her enemies, more than when it is known that she is \"unwell.\" It  serves in many ways as a blessing to her, rather than an inconvenience.  Let no young girl be alarmed, as, owing to the negligence of her parents  or guardians, many are, at the first appearance of this flow of blood  from the genital organs. She should keep more quiet than usual, at these  times, until the flow disappears, which it will do in a few days. In a  state of health these appearances occur every twenty-eight days and the  young lady should exercise extreme caution at such times, in avoiding  unnecessary fatigue, exposure to cold, getting wet, suddenly cooling off  when heated, etc. One of the reasons why so many suffer at this time is  due to the want of proper knowledge and care, also for the want of a  proper feeling about the matter. I have known young ladies to be guilty  of the almost incredible crime of trying to arrest the flow by plugging  up the vagina and by resorting to other means, that they might attend a  dancing party or some pleasure excursion. Such a procedure is sure to be  followed by the direst retribution to the offender. Nature never allows  her laws to be so trifled with. Some experience a deep mortification on  account of this function; some think it a very great inconvenience and a  nuisance--an obstacle to their pleasure; others feel unhappy and vexed  about it. In truth, every woman should consider it a privilege and  should regard menstruation as it really is, a blessing from heaven; and,  when rightly performed, a help to lend loveliness to her character,  beauty to her expression, music to her voice, and gracefulness to her  form and movements.    Mothers or guardians should instruct young girls in good time as to the  expected menstrual function and prepare their minds for its advent. They  should also be carefully instructed in regard to the external use of  water--of its attendant danger, lest they chill themselves sufficiently  to arrest this flow, which should continue uninterruptedly until the  function is complete. Too many lives have been sacrificed by suppressing  the monthly flux; external ablutions should be plentiful, but only  sufficient, as in the case of boys, for cleanliness. If menstruation  should not become healthfully established at the proper time of age,  consult a judicious physician who will see that any abnormal condition,  preventing such consummation, is properly removed. \"The principal organs  of elimination, common to both sexes, are the bowels, kidneys, lungs and  skin. A neglect of their functions is punished in each alike. To woman  is intrusted the exclusive management of another process of elimination,  viz.: the catamenial function. This, using the blood for its channel of  operation, performs, like the blood, double duty. It is necessary to  ovulation, and to the integrity of every part of the reproductive  apparatus; it also serves as a means of elimination for the blood  itself. A careless management of this function, at any period of life  during its existence, is apt to be followed by consequences that may be  serious; but a neglect of it during the epoch of development, that is,  from the age of fourteen to eighteen or twenty, not only produces great  evil at the time of the neglect, but leaves a large legacy of evil to  the future. The system is then peculiarly susceptible; and disturbances  of the delicate mechanism we are considering, induced during the  catamenial weeks of that critical age by constrained positions, muscular  effort, brain work, and all forms of mental and physical excitement,  germinate a host of ills.\"[H]      [H] Clarke: \"Sex in Education.\"    Here I must be allowed to protest most solemnly against the use of  injections into the vagina for the so-called purpose of cleanliness.  Vaginal syringes are constructed and used now by thousands and the  sufferings of the human race are increased thereby ten thousand fold  proportionately. The vagina, like all organs supplied with a mucous  membrane, is self-cleansing. Water, or any other fluid thrown into this  organ, has a tendency to disorder the mucous follicles, to dry up their  secretions and thus prevent the efflux of some of Nature's necessities.  From this cause alone there will be a reaction upon the vaginal walls,  upon the neck of the uterus and the uterus itself; the ovaries also  become disordered; the lungs sympathize as well as the throat and  bronchial tubes, producing hoarseness, hacking cough and a host of  troubles following in their train. Nervous headaches of fearful  intensity are frequently produced from this unnatural course of  procedure. Moreover, water thrown into the vagina, to wash it out, day  after day for a considerable time, absolutely produces a leucorrhoea  most persistent in character. This is the confession of young ladies to  me in making inquiry as to the origin of their trouble, and I have found  that the discharge was unknown to some of them till after the use of  these injections. It stands to reason that such unnatural washings  should be followed by a retribution equal to the error committed,  because, as before stated, Nature's laws cannot be perverted without a  penalty. A girl should never, under any pretext whatever, resort to such  unhallowed means for the cure or alleviation of leucorrhoea, ulceration,  or for any disorders that affect these parts. By so doing she is really  forming a basis for innumerable future ills. If the girl is well, she  has none of these disorders, for they all arise from constitutional  derangements. As all must acknowledge, it is a self-evident fact--that,  _if a woman is well, every part of her must be well also_; no one organ  can, unaided, get up a disease by itself. In all troubles of this  nature, as well as of any other, consult a judicious physician.    There are objections, however, of even a graver nature than those urged  above against the use of such instruments. They often excite sensations  in the parts to which they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31686"],[0,"Collector's Item (#8)"],[1,"objections,  glancing involuntarily in Jrann-Pttt's direction. There were none.  \"Right,\" he said, repressing any outward symptoms of relief.    He efficiently deployed the personnel to the positions on the raft where  he felt they might be least useless, the gear being piled in the middle  and surmounted by Algol, who naturally assumed possession of the softest  and safest place by the divine right of cats.    _The captain does have a commanding presence_, Miss Anspacher thought,  _and a sort of uncouth grace. Moreover, he cannot read my mind--in fact,  he often cannot even understand me when I speak._    \"All right!\" he bellowed. \"Cast off!\"    The vine unfastened the rope that it had insouciantly attached to a tree  trunk, remarking to the others, \"Don't let the trees intimidate you.  Actually their bark is worse than their bite.\" Now it dropped lithely on  board the raft, looking for a comfortable resting place.    \"Please don't twine around me,\" Miss Anspacher said coldly. \"If you  insist upon coming with us, you will have to choose an inanimate object  to cling to.\"    \"All right, all right,\" it tried to soothe her. \"No need to get yourself  all worked up over such a mere triviality, is there? I'll just coil  myself tidily around one of those spare logs. I must say you're warmer,  though.\"    _Yes, she is, isn't she?_ thought the captain, and squeezed her hand.           *       *       *       *       *    The raft drifted down the river. Since the current was flowing in the  desired direction, there did not appear to be any need to use the poles,  and everyone sat or reclined as comfortably as possible in the  suffocating heat. The yellow haze had become so thick that they seemed  to be at the bottom of a custard cup.    [Illustration]    \"I do hope we're heading the right way,\" Professor Bernardi said,  _although who knows what is right and what is wrong any more_?    \"Perhaps we aren't,\" Mrs. Bernardi mused, stroking Algol, who had  crawled into her lap. \"Perhaps we will go drifting along endlessly.  Every sixteen days, it will get dark and every sixteen days it will get  light, and meanwhile we will continue floating along, never going  anywhere, never getting anywhere, never seeing anything but haze and  raft and river and each other.\" Algol wheezed in his sleep.    \"Nonsense!\" Jrann-Pttt said rudely. \"I have a compass. I know the  direction perfectly well.\"    \"And yet you let us think we were wandering about blindly.\" Miss  Anspacher gave him a contemptuous look. The captain pressed her hand.    \"Since you seem to breathe the same air and eat much the same food that  we do, Mr. Pitt,\" Mrs. Bernardi changed her tack, \"I suppose we'll be  physically comfortable on your planet for the rest of our lives. Our  children will be born there and our children's children, and eventually  they'll forget all about Earth and think it was only a legend.\"    \"But you did expect to settle permanently on Venus, didn't you?\" the  vine asked, bewilderedly. \"Or for a long visit, anyway. So I don't  really see that it makes much difference if you go to Jrann-Pttt's Alpha  Centauri place. So much nicer to be living with friends, I should  think.\"    \"But Alpha Centauri is so very far away,\" Mrs. Bernardi sighed. \"There  wouldn't be much chance of our ever getting back.\"    \"Look!\" Mortland exclaimed. \"The river's branching. Which fork do we  take?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jrann-Pttt, who had been dabbling his arms idly in the translucent  violet-blue water, withdrew them hastily as nine green eyes, obviously  belonging to the same individual, rose to the surface and regarded him  with more than casual interest. He consulted his compass. \"Left.\"    \"Contrarily!\" the mosquito-bat suddenly squeaked, pointing a small rod  at his companions. \"Rightward.\"    There was a stunned silence.    \"Monster!\" Mortland cried in reproach. \"You can talk! How could you  deceive us like that?\"    \"Can talk,\" the creature retorted. \"Me not intelligent life-form, ha!  Who talks last talks best. Have not linguistic facility of inferior  life-forms, but can communicate rudely in your language.\"    \"Remember,\" Mortland cautioned, \"there are ladies present.\"    \"Have been lying low and laughing to self--ha, ha!--at witlessness of  lowerly life-forms.\"    \"But why?\" Mrs. Bernardi demanded distractedly. \"Haven't we been kind to  you?\"    \"You be likewise well treated in our zoo,\" it assured her. \"All of you.  Our zoo finest in Galaxy. And clean, too.\"    \"Now really, sir, I must protest--\" Professor Bernardi began, trying to  extricate a blaster unobtrusively from the pile of gear in which the  too-confident terrestrials had cached their weapons.    Monster gestured with his rod. \"This is lethal weapon. Do not try  hindrancing me. Hate damage fine specimens. Captain, go rightward.\"    \"Oh, is that so!\" Greenfield retorted hotly. \"Let me tell you, you--you  insect!\"    \"George!\" Miss Anspacher clutched his arm. \"Do what it says. For my  sake, George!\"    \"Oh, all right,\" he muttered. \"Just for you, then. Told you not to trust  any of 'em,\" he went on, reluctantly poling the raft in the ordered  direction. \"Foreigners!\"    \"Fine zoo,\" the mosquito-bat insisted. \"Very clean. Run with utmost  efficientness. Strict visiting hours.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"And there goes Plan D,\" the vine said lightly. There was a hint of  laughter in its voice. Jrann-Pttt stared at it in consternation. \"Are  you also from the Alpha Centauri system, sir?\" It turned its attention  to the mosquito-bat. \"Naturally I'm curious to know where I'm going,\" it  explained, \"since I seem definitely to be included in your gracious  invitation.\"    \"Alpha Centauri, hah!\" the mosquito-bat snorted. \"I from what Earthlets  laughingly term Sirius. Alpha Centauri merely little star.\"    \"Now see here!\" Jrann-Pttt sprang to his feet. Criminal he might be, but  he was not going to sit there and have his sun insulted!    \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" Miss Anspacher cried. \"No use getting yourself  killed, Jrann-Pttt!\"    \"Correctly,\" Monster approved. \"Elementary intelligence displayed. Why  damage fine specimens?\"    _From one prison into another_, the saurian mentalized bitterly.    _Yes_, returned Dfar-Lll, _and it's all your fault._ The junior lizard  burst into tears. _I wish I had let Merglyt-Ruuu do what he wanted. I  would have been better off._    \"Sirius,\" the vine repeated. \"That's even farther away than Alpha  Centauri, isn't it? I never thought I would get that far away from the  swamp! This really will be an adventure!\"    \"How do you know--\" Professor Bernardi began.    \"Frankly,\" it went on, \"I don't see why you chaps are so put out by the  whole thing. What's the difference between Alpha Centauri and Sirius  anyway? Matter of a few light-years, but otherwise a star's a star for  all that.\"    \"To Jrann-Pttt, we wouldn't have been specimens,\" Mrs. Bernardi said,  belatedly recognizing the advantages of Alpha Centauri.    \"No, not specimens,\" the vine told her easily. \"I don't suppose you know  he had no intention of taking you back to his system. He wanted you to  help him kill the officers of his ship so they couldn't look for him and  the other escaped prisoner or report back to his planet. Then he was  going to put the ship out of commission and found his own colony here  with you as his slaves. I'd just as soon be a specimen as a slave.  Sooner. Better to reign in a zoo than serve in a swamp!\"    \"Just how do you know all this?\" Miss Anspacher demanded.    \"It's obvious enough,\" Bernardi said gloomily. \"Another telepath.\" _How  can we compete or even cope with creatures like these? What a fool I  was to think I could outwit them._    \"Telepathy just tricksomeness,\" the mosquito-bat put in jealously. \"I  have no telepathy, yet superior to all.\"    \"But why should Mr. Pitt want to kill his officers?\" Mrs. Bernardi asked  querulously. \"He's the commandant, isn't he? Or is he a professor? I  never got that straight.\"    \"He was one of the criminals on the ship,\" the vine told her. \"What you  might call a confidence man. This is about the only system in the Galaxy  where he isn't wanted. He did tell you the truth, though, when he said  they were sent on an expedition to collect zoological specimens.  Dangerous work,\" it sighed, \"and so his people use criminals for it.  They were sent out in small detachments. Our friend here killed his  guard in a fight over a female prisoner, which was why--\"    \"But what happened to the female prisoner?\" Miss Anspacher's eye caught  Dfar-Lll's. \"Oh, no!\" she gasped.    \"Why not?\" Dfar-Lll demanded. \"I'm as much of a female as you are. Maybe  even more.\"    The captain leaned close to Miss Anspacher. \"No one can be more feminine  than you are, Dolores,\" he whispered.    \"But he--she's so young!\" Mrs. Bernardi wailed.    The vine made an amused sound. \"Don't you have juvenile delinquents on  Earth?\"    \"Oh, what does all that matter now?\" Jrann-Pttt said sullenly. \"We're  all going to a Sirian zoo, anyway.\"    \"Correctly,\" approved the monster-bat. \"Finest zoo. Clean. Commodious  cages. Reasonable visiting hours. Very nice.\"    Mrs. Bernardi began to cry.    \"Now,\" the vine comforted her, \"a zoo's not so bad. After all, most of  us spend our lives in cages of one kind or another, and without the  basic security a zoo affords--\"    \"But we don't know we're in cages,\" Mrs. Bernardi sobbed. \"That's the  important thing.\"    Professor Bernardi looked at the vine. \"But why are you--\" he began,  then halted. \"Perhaps I don't want an answer,\" he said. There was no  hope at all left in him, now that there was no doubt.    \"You are wise,\" the vine agreed quietly. Algol arose from Mr. Bernardi's  lap and rubbed against its thick pale green stem. He knew. The  mosquito-bat looked at both of them restlessly.    The yellow haze had deepened to old gold. Now it was beginning to turn  brown.    \"It's twilight,\""]]]
