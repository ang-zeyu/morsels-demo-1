[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#8)"],[1," So he stood intently, motionlessly, listening, listening;  but all was silent except for the monotonous dripping of water in one of  the nooks of the court-yard, and the distant murmur of the river borne  upon the breath of the night air. \"Mayhap I was mistaken,\" muttered  Schwartz Carl to himself.    But the next moment the silence was broken again by a faint, shrill  whistle; what did it mean?    Back of the heavy oaken door of the tower was Schwartz Carl's cross-bow,  the portable windlass with which the bowstring was drawn back, and a  pouch of bolts. Schwartz Carl reached back into the darkness, fumbling  in the gloom until his fingers met the weapon. Setting his foot in the  iron stirrup at the end of the stock, he wound the stout bow-string  into the notch of the trigger, and carefully fitted the heavy,  murderous-looking bolt into the groove.    Minute after minute passed, and Schwartz Carl, holding his arbelast in  his hand, stood silently waiting and watching in the sharp-cut, black  shadow of the doorway, motionless as a stone statue. Minute after minute  passed. Suddenly there was a movement in the shadow of the arch of the  great gateway across the court-yard, and the next moment a leathern-clad  figure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement, and stood there  listening, his head bent to one side. Schwartz Carl knew very well  that it was no one belonging to the castle, and, from the nature of his  action, that he was upon no good errand.    He did not stop to challenge the suspicious stranger. The taking of  another's life was thought too small a matter for much thought or care  in those days. Schwartz Carl would have shot a man for a much smaller  reason than the suspicious actions of this fellow. The leather-clad  figure stood a fine target in the moonlight for a cross-bow bolt.  Schwartz Carl slowly raised the weapon to his shoulder and took a long  and steady aim. Just then the stranger put his fingers to his lips and  gave a low, shrill whistle. It was the last whistle that he was to give  upon this earth. There was a sharp, jarring twang of the bow-string, the  hiss of the flying bolt, and the dull thud as it struck its mark. The  man gave a shrill, quavering cry, and went staggering back, and then  fell all of a heap against the wall behind him. As though in answer to  the cry, half a dozen men rushed tumultuously out from the shadow of  the gateway whence the stranger had just come, and then stood in the  court-yard, looking uncertainly this way and that, not knowing from what  quarter the stroke had come that had laid their comrade low.    But Schwartz Carl did not give them time to discover that; there was no  chance to string his cumbersome weapon again; down he flung it upon the  ground. \"To arms!\" he roared in a voice of thunder, and then clapped to  the door of Melchior's tower and shot the great iron bolts with a clang  and rattle.    The next instant the Trutz-Drachen men were thundering at the door, but  Schwartz Carl was already far up the winding steps.    But now the others came pouring out from the gateway. \"To the house,\"  roared Baron Henry.    Then suddenly a clashing, clanging uproar crashed out upon the night.  Dong! Dong! It was the great alarm bell from Melchior's tower--Schwartz  Carl was at his post.    Little Baron Otto lay sleeping upon the great rough bed in his room,  dreaming of the White Cross on the hill and of brother John. By and by  he heard the convent bell ringing, and knew that there must be visitors  at the gate, for loud voices sounded through his dream. Presently he  knew that he was coming awake, but though the sunny monastery garden  grew dimmer and dimmer to his sleeping sight, the clanging of the bell  and the sound of shouts grew louder and louder. Then he opened his eyes.  Flaming red lights from torches, carried hither and thither by people  in the court-yard outside, flashed and ran along the wall of his  room. Hoarse shouts and cries filled the air, and suddenly the shrill,  piercing shriek of a woman rang from wall to wall; and through the  noises the great bell from far above upon Melchior's tower clashed and  clanged its harsh, resonant alarm.    Otto sprang from his bed and looked out of the window and down upon  the court-yard below. \"Dear God! what dreadful thing hath happened?\" he  cried and clasped his hands together.    A cloud of smoke was pouring out from the windows of the building across  the court-yard, whence a dull ruddy glow flashed and flickered. Strange  men were running here and there with flaming torches, and the now  continuous shrieking of women pierced the air.    Just beneath the window lay the figure of a man half naked and face  downward upon the stones. Then suddenly Otto cried out in fear and  horror, for, as he looked with dazed and bewildered eyes down into the  lurid court-yard beneath, a savage man, in a shining breast-plate and  steel cap, came dragging the dark, silent figure of a woman across the  stones; but whether she was dead or in a swoon, Otto could not tell.    And every moment the pulsing of that dull red glare from the windows of  the building across the court-yard shone more brightly, and the glare  from other flaming buildings, which Otto could not see from his window,  turned the black, starry night into a lurid day.    Just then the door of the room was burst open, and in rushed poor old  Ursela, crazy with her terror. She flung herself down upon the floor and  caught Otto around the knees. \"Save me!\" she cried, \"save me!\" as though  the poor, pale child could be of any help to her at such a time. In the  passageway without shone the light of torches, and the sound of loud  footsteps came nearer and nearer.    And still through all the din sounded continually the clash and clang  and clamor of the great alarm bell.    The red light flashed into the room, and in the doorway stood a tall,  thin figure clad from head to foot in glittering chain armor. From  behind this fierce knight, with his dark, narrow, cruel face, its  deep-set eyes glistening in the light of the torches, crowded six or  eight savage, low-browed, brutal men, who stared into the room and  at the white-faced boy as he stood by the window with the old woman  clinging to his knees and praying to him for help.    \"We have cracked the nut and here is the kernel,\" said one of them who  stood behind the rest, and thereupon a roar of brutal laughter went up.  But the cruel face of the armed knight never relaxed into a smile;  he strode into the room and laid his iron hand heavily upon the boy's  shoulder. \"Art thou the young Baron Otto?\" said he, in a harsh voice.    \"Aye,\" said the lad; \"but do not kill me.\"    The knight did not answer him. \"Fetch the cord hither,\" said he, \"and  drag the old witch away.\"    It took two of them to loosen poor old Ursela's crazy clutch from about  her young master. Then amid roars of laughter they dragged her away,  screaming and scratching and striking with her fists.    They drew back Otto's arms behind his back and wrapped them round and  round with a bowstring. Then they pushed and hustled and thrust him  forth from the room and along the passageway, now bright with the flames  that roared and crackled without. Down the steep stairway they drove  him, where thrice he stumbled and fell amid roars of laughter. At last  they were out into the open air of the court-yard. Here was a terrible  sight, but Otto saw nothing of it; his blue eyes were gazing far away,  and his lips moved softly with the prayer that the good monks of St.  Michaelsburg had taught him, for he thought that they meant to slay him.    All around the court-yard the flames roared and snapped and crackled.  Four or five figures lay scattered here and there, silent in all the  glare and uproar. The heat was so intense that they were soon forced  back into the shelter of the great gateway, where the women captives,  under the guard of three or four of the Trutz-Drachen men, were crowded  together in dumb, bewildered terror. Only one man was to be seen among  the captives, poor, old, half blind Master Rudolph, the steward,  who crouched tremblingly among the women. They had set the blaze to  Melchior's tower, and now, below, it was a seething furnace. Above, the  smoke rolled in black clouds from the windows, but still the alarm bell  sounded through all the blaze and smoke. Higher and higher the flames  rose; a trickle of fire ran along the frame buildings hanging aloft in  the air. A clear flame burst out at the peak of the roof, but still the  bell rang forth its clamorous clangor. Presently those who watched below  saw the cluster of buildings bend and sink and sway; there was a crash  and roar, a cloud of sparks flew up as though to the very heavens  themselves, and the bell of Melchior's tower was stilled forever. A  great shout arose from the watching, upturned faces.    \"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, and out from the gateway they swept and  across the drawbridge, leaving Drachenhausen behind them a flaming  furnace blazing against the gray of the early dawning.          VIII. In the House of the Dragon Scorner.    Tall, narrow, gloomy room; no furniture but a rude bench a bare stone  floor, cold stone walls and a gloomy ceiling of arched stone over head;  a long, narrow slit of a window high above in the wall, through the iron  bars of which Otto could see a small patch of blue sky and now and then  a darting swallow, for an instant seen, the next instant gone. Such  was the little baron's prison in Trutz-Drachen. Fastened to a bolt  and hanging against the walls, hung a pair of heavy chains with gaping  fetters at the ends. They were thick with rust, and the red stain of  the rust streaked the wall below where they hung like a smear of blood.  Little Otto shuddered as he looked at them; can those be meant for me,  he thought.    Nothing was to be seen but that one patch of blue sky far up in the  wall.

What variety of  mental conditions have we not experienced? These are all so many  evidences of an internal _substance_ that we call spirit. That spirit is  to be distinguished from thought as cause is from effect is evident; and  also from matter lying in the accident or quality of body, is certain,  from the fact of its being subject to such rapid and instantaneous  changes of condition. Amidst all the different modes, qualities, or  accidents of mind, we believe ourselves to be the same individual being;  and this conviction is the result of that law of thought which always  associates qualities with things.    In the world around us phenomena, qualities or accidents are continually  changing, but we believe that these, all, are produced by causes which  _remain, as substances, the same_. And as we know ourselves to be the  causes of our own acts, and to be able to change, within a moment, the  modes of our own mind, so we believe the changes of matter, which take  place _more slowly_, to be produced by causes which belong to the  _substances of matter_. And underlying all causes, whether of the  qualities of matter or mind, we conceive of one absolute cause, one  substance, in itself persistent and upholding all things in nature. This  substance we are pleased to call spirit; and this spirit we call God. To  deny this is to strike down a grand law of thought, the foundation  principle of substance, and make the testimony of our own consciousness  A LIE! The inorganic forces, about which \"unbelievers\" have so much to  say are altogether operative in the realm of _substance_; that is to  say, they belong to the _invisible_. Organic and inorganic are the same  as visible and invisible. We know matter by its qualities, and we know  mind by its qualities. These two, in qualities or attributes, contrast  with each other like life and death. One is extenuated and the other  extended; one is invisible the other is visible. Of the existence of  these substances and their laws we have evidence in conscious knowledge,  in that we know that we have no control over the involuntary or  sympathetic nervous system, and have the most perfect control over the  voluntary nerves. The forces controlling are as different as these  qualities themselves. If man is simply a material organism, why this  contrast? We are told that _life itself_ is a group of co-ordinated  functions. But what correllates that force?    It is very common for the advocates of the evolution hypothesis to  measure the period between this and the origin of life by the phrase,  \"Millions and millions of years.\" The only object that such writers have  in view in so doing is to bridge the gulf between the _assumed_ origin  of life and mind and the evidence necessary to its establishment as a  fact in science. They tell us that \"life is a property which certain  elements of matter exhibit when united in a special form under special  conditions.\" But when we ask them to give us those certain elements of  matter, they immediately inform us that \"matter has about sixty-three  elements; that each element has special properties, and that these  elements admit of an _infinite variety of combinations_, each  combination having peculiar properties.\" This, as a fort, is a stand  behind the dark, impenetrable curtain of an _infinite variety of  combinations_. It is just as dark and as destitute of proof as any  pope's assumed infallibility.    Mr. Haeckel says: \"As a matter of course, to the _infinite varieties_  presented by the organic forms and vital phenomena in the vegetable and  animal kingdoms, correspond an equally _infinite variety_ of chemical  composition in the protoplasm. The most minute homogeneous constituents  of this life substance, the protoplasm molecules, must in their chemical  composition present an _infinite number_ of extremely delicate  gradations and variations. According to the plastic theory recently  advanced (?) the great variety of vital phenomena is the consequence of  the _infinitely delicate_ chemical difference in the composition of  protoplasm, the sole active life substance.\" What a multitude of  infinities. But then, an _infinite number_, and an _infinite variety_ of  _infinitely delicate_ gradations and variations, with millions and  millions of years, do not remove further from sight life in its origin  than does the materialistic philosophy of one substance. They constitute  the _web_ and _filling_ of the _blanket of oblivion_ used by  materialistic doctors to cover up their ignorance of life and its  origin. A half dozen \"INFINITIES,\" and \"MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS!\"  What! should I care if my ancestors were \"tadpoles,\" when they are HID  AWAY IN THE CENTER OF INFINITIES, and laid _away back yonder_, so far  off as \"MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS?\"    When we ask our friends for the proof necessary to establish this  speculation as a fact among facts, they find it very convenient to  betake themselves to _infinities_, and _millions_ and _millions of  years_.    But we Christians do not ask them to give us an _infinite variety_,  etc., but to give us the \"certain elements\" of which \"life is a  property,\" and the \"special form in which these certain elements were  united,\" and the \"special conditions\" that existed when life first made  its appearance by spontaneous generation. When we do this we are  immediately carried away into the _infinities_. The result is that the  solution of the problem of the origin of life by spontaneous generation,  as a property of \"certain elements of matter, united in a special form,  under special conditions,\" is buried forever out of sight. This same  definition of life is found on page 69 of a work entitled, \"The System  of Nature,\" published by D. Holbach, a French Atheist, in 1774, in these  words: \"Experience proves to us that the matter which we regard as inert  and dead assumes action, intelligence and life when it is combined in a  certain way.\"    Voltaire answered: \"This is precisely the difficulty. How does a germ  come to life? Is not this definition very easy--very common? Is not life  organization with feeling? But,\" says Voltaire, \"that you have these two  properties from the motion of matter alone: it is impossible to give any  proof, and if it can not be proved why affirm it? Why say aloud, 'I  know,' while you say to yourself, 'I know not?'\"    Our Atheistic friends say: \"The forms of life vary because of the  difference in their molecular construction, resulting from different  physical conditions to which the various forms have been subjected.\"    Wonderful discovery! Does it explain the evidence of design which is  presented in pairing off male and female in the same form of life?    Dr. Parvin is often referred to as \"frankly admitting that the doctrine  of the evolution of species is accepted by three-fourths of the  scientific men,\" and that this doctrine has, in their minds, \"rendered  nugatory the hypothesis of a vital immaterial principle as a causal  factor in the phenomena of life and mind.\" Allowing this statement its  full force, it is still true that none but Atheists can possibly be  included in the \"three-fourths.\" So much the worse for them. But it is  an Atheistic trick to try to succeed by a misrepresentation of facts.  One of their number recently said, \"It is now almost universally  believed by those who have investigated the subject that life  originated from natural agencies without the aid of a creative  intelligence. Then those who have investigated the subject are almost  universally _Atheists_?\"    It is said that \"vital activity, whether of body or mind, is a mode of  motion, the correllate of antecedent motion.\" But what correllated the  force? According to this logic life came from the antecedent motion;  that is, from the motion of dead atoms. But motion itself is the  manifestation of energy, and there must of necessity be something behind  it to which it belongs as an attribute. Do you say it was dead atoms, or  matter without life? Then dead atoms set dead atoms into motion and  produced life! Can you believe this? If you can, you need find no  trouble in believing in the most orthodox hell. Can you get more out of  a thing than there is in it? We don't think so. But we do think that  there is credulity enough, even blind credulity, in the advocates of  spontaneous generation to enable them to believe anything they may  happen to wish true. We are told that \"life in its higher forms is not  an immaterial entity, _nor the result_ of a special form of _force  termed vital_, but, that it is a group of co-ordinated functions.\" Then  what correllated the force? If it was not vitality what was it? But this  is just equivalent to saying that life does not proceed from life. So,  in the realm of inertia or death, without a God and without life, some  kind of a mechanical operation among dead atoms took place which  produced \"a certain chemico-physical constitution of amorphous  matter--on that albuminous substance called sarcode or protoplasm,\"  which evolved more than was involved, or brought organic life out of  dead inorganic matter. But life is simply a \"mode,\" or \"degree of  motion?\" But we are curious to know just here whether the advocates of  this"]]]
