[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#8)"],[1,", turns off the  motor-batteries and reduces the volume and force of motor-nerve  currents, strychnine, when following it as an antidote, turns them on  again, acting with the unerring certainty of a chemical test, _if  administered in sufficient quantity_. Purely physiological in its  action, it neutralises the effects of the snake-poison, and announces,  by unmistakable symptoms, when it has accomplished this task, and would,  if continued, become a poison itself. Previous to this announcement its  poisonous action is completely neutralised by the snake-poison, and the  latter would therefore be equally as efficacious in strychnine-poisoning  as strychnine is in snake-poisoning. Strychnine, in short, is the  antidote _par excellence_ of snake-poison, and cannot be surpassed by  any other substance known to us.    With the symptoms following the introduction of the subtle ophidian  virus into the human and animal system so markedly pointing to  strychnine as the antidote, it appears a matter of surprise that it was  not used as such before and that it was left to the writer to discover  the antagonism between the two poisons. Misleading experiments with the  drug on animals erroneously considered to be final in their results,  together with confused and contradictory notions about the action of  snake-poison, were the chief factors, already pointed out, that caused  research on this important subject to remain for centuries so barren of  results, and made even able investigators with more correct views than  the rest, postpone the discovery of a physiological antidote to a more  advanced state of science, when all the time it was lying ready at their  hands.    It is self-evident from preceding statements, that in the treatment of  snakebite with strychnine the ordinary doses must be greatly exceeded,  and that its administration must be continued, even if the total  quantity injected within an hour or two amounts to what in the absence  of snake-poison would be a dangerous if not a fatal dose. Timidity in  handling the drug is fraught with far more danger than a bold and  fearless use of it. The few failures among its numerous successes  recorded during the last four years in Australia were nearly all  traceable to the antidote not having been injected in sufficient  quantity. Even slight tetanic convulsions, which were noticed in a few  cases, invariably passed off quickly. It should be borne in mind that of  the two poisons warring with each other that of the snake is by far the  most insidious and dangerous one, more especially in its effects on the  vaso-motor centres. The latter are wrought very insidiously, and where  they predominate require the most energetic use of the antidote, for  whilst the timid practitioner after injecting as much strychnine as he  deems safe stands idly by waiting for its effects, the snake virus, not  checked by a sufficient quantity of it, continues its baneful work,  drawing the blood mass into the paralysed abdominal veins and finally by  arrested heart action bringing on sudden collapse. In such cases even  some tetanic convulsions are of little danger and may actually be  necessary to overcome the paralysis of the splanchnicus and with it that  of the other vaso-motor centres.    Whilst then it must be laid down as a principle that the antidote should  be administered freely and without regard to the quantity that may be  required to develop symptoms of its own physiological action, the doses  in which it is injected and the intervals between them must be left to  the practitioner's judgment, as they depend in every case on the  quantity of snake-poison absorbed, the time elapsed since its inception  and the corresponding greater or lesser urgency of the symptoms. If the  latter denote a large dose to have been imparted and it has been in the  system for hours, delay is dangerous and nothing less than 16 minims of  liq. strychnine P.B., in very urgent cases even 20 to 25 minims should  be injected to any person over 15 years of age. Even children may  require these large doses, as they are determined by the quantity of the  poison they have to counteract and are kept in check by it. The action  of the antidote is so prompt and decisive that not more than 15 to 20  minutes need to elapse, after the first injection, before further  measures can be decided on. If the poisoning symptoms show no abatement  by that time, a second injection of the same strength should be made  promptly, and unless after it a decided improvement is perceptible, a  third one after the same interval. As the action of strychnine when  applied as antidote is not cumulative, no fear needs to be entertained  of violent effects suddenly breaking out after these large doses  repeated at short intervals. They are, so to say, swallowed up by the  snake-poison and remain latent except in counteracting the latter. This  has now been proven abundantly by scores of qualified observers in all  parts of Australia, and still more by Banerjee in India. No hesitation,  therefore, should be felt by medical men in other snake-infested  countries to adopt the Australian treatment. It is seldom that more than  half a grain of strychnine administered in 16m. doses of liq. strychniae  is required here to effectually counteract the venom and place its  intended victim out of danger. Ligature and excision of the bitten skin  have usually been practised and much of the poison eliminated before the  antidote is applied. Our snakes, however, as already pointed out, with  their shorter and merely grooved fangs, do not perforate the cellular  tissue to such depth nor instil as large a quantity of poison as the  cobras, kraits and vipers of India or the rattlesnake of America, all  having perforated and much longer fangs and much more productive poison  glands. Even if after the bite of a vigorous cobra, for instance, a  ligature has been applied and the bitten part deeply excised, a  comparatively large quantity of poison will probably be absorbed  requiring much larger quantities of the antidote, perhaps grains of it,  to effect a cure.    If under the influence of these large doses the symptoms abate, or if  the latter are comparatively mild from the first, smaller doses of  strychnine should be injected, say from 1/15th to 1/10th of a grain, but  under all circumstances the rule that, distinct strychnia symptoms must  be produced before the injections are discontinued, should never be  departed from. This rule is a perfectly safe one, for its observance  entails no danger, a few muscular spasms or even slight tetanic  convulsions being easily subdued and harmless as compared with that  most insidious condition exemplified in case No. 1, cited below, the  first one treated with strychnine by the writer, who, having no  experience in the treatment, did not administer quite enough strychnine.  The patient, after apparently recovering from a moribund condition and  being able to walk and even to mount a horse, remained partly under the  influence of the poison and succumbed to it during sleep, when,  according to subsequent experience, one more injection would have saved  him.    The tendency to relapses is always great when much snake-poison has been  absorbed. Apparently yielding to the antidote for a time, the insidious  venom, after a shorter or longer interval, during which it appears to  have been conquered, all at once re-asserts its presence, and has to be  met by such fresh injections, regardless of the quantity of strychnine  previously administered, but the amount required in most relapses is not  a large one. The writer formerly inclined to the belief that the strain  thus put on the delicate nerve-cells would limit the usefulness of the  antidote to cases requiring not much above a grain. Knowing the Indian  snakes to impart to their victims such comparatively large quantities of  venom, he had strong misgivings as to his method standing the severe  test of Indian practice; and it was most fortunate for this method that  its first practical application in India was made by a gentleman who,  whilst thoroughly familiar with its principles and convinced of their  correctness, had the courage to apply them fearlessly by injecting what  to us Australians appear enormous quantities, ranging as they do up to  three and four grains per patient. Dr. Banerjee's eight cases, all  successful, and of which the most important one, relating to the much  and justly dreaded Duboia Russellii, was published in the November  number of the _Australasian Medical Gazette_, settled the treatment of  snakebite in India as well as elsewhere. If the poison of Bungarus  coeruleus, Echis carinata, and Duboia Russellii can be successfully  counteracted, and if for this purpose four grains of strychnine can be  injected with perfect impunity, it may be inferred with certainty that  the poison of the cobra, fer-de-lance, and the rattlesnake--in fact, of  any snake known to us will be found amenable to the antidote, and that,  if four grains can be injected with safety, we may venture on six and  eight grains, if they are required. In those cases only where the long  fangs of these snakes perforate into a vein, and a large quantity of the  venom injected into the blood-stream overpowers the nerve-centres so as  to make death imminent, if not almost instantaneous, the subcutaneous  injections may be found of little use. Here intravenous injections of  half a grain and even one grain doses would appear to be indicated, and  might yet fan the flame of life afresh, even when respiration and pulse  at wrist have already ceased. We have seen both these functions extinct  in Australia and restored by comparatively small doses of the antidote,  and can see no reason why a more energetic use of it should not restore  them in India.    Considering the terrible mortality from snakebite in India, Dr.  Banerjee's merit in being the first to introduce the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#8)"],[1," dose will last until next wash time.  It is best carried in the tiny \"one drink\" whiskey flasks, holding, I  suppose, two or three ounces. One flask full will last you all summer.  At first the pine tar smell will bother you, but in a short time you  will get to like it. It will call up to your memory the reaches of trout  streams, and the tall still aisles of the forests.      _SUMMARY_              _Minimum for comfort_              Matches and safe            Pocket knife (2 blade)            Sheath knife            Compass            1 bandana            Sporting outfit            Duffle bag            Soap and case            Crash towel            Tooth brush            Tooth soap            Shaving set in oiled silk            Medicines and bandages            Fly dope (sometimes)                _Maximum_              Matches and safe            Pocket knife            Sheath knife            Compass            2 bandanas            Sporting outfit            Duffle bag            Soap and case            Crash towel            Bath towel            Tooth brush            Tooth soap            Shaving set in oiled silk            Medicines and bandages            Fly dope and head net    FOOTNOTE:    [2] Kephart, in his excellent book on _Camping and Woodcraft_, suggests  carrying soap in a rubber tobacco pouch. This is a good idea.          CHAPTER V    CAMP OUTFIT      [Sidenote: Tents]    IN many sections of the country you will need a tent, even when  traveling afoot. Formerly a man had to make a choice between canvas,  which is heavy but fairly waterproof, and drill, which is light but  flimsy. A seven by seven duck tent weighs fully twenty-five pounds when  dry, and a great many more when wet. It will shed rain as long as you do  not hit against it. A touch on the inside, however, will often start a  trickle at the point of contact. Altogether it is unsatisfactory, and  one does not wonder than many men prefer to knock together bark  shelters.    [Illustration: \"Bed in the bush with stars to see\"]    [Sidenote: Tent Material]    Nowadays, however, another and better material is to be had. It is the  stuff balloons are made of, and is called balloon silk. I believe, for  shelter purposes, it undergoes a further waterproofing process, but of  this I am not certain. A tent of the size mentioned, instead of  weighing twenty-five pounds, pulls the scales down at about eight.  Furthermore, it does not absorb moisture, and is no heavier when wet  than when dry. One can touch the inside all he wishes without rendering  it pervious. The material is tough and enduring.    [Illustration: _\"A\" Tent Pitched as Shelter._]    I have one which I have used hard for five years, not only as a tent,  but as a canoe lining, a sod cloth, a tarpaulin, and a pack canvas.  To-day it is as serviceable as ever, and excepting for inevitable  soiling, two small patches represents its entire wear and tear.    [Illustration: _\"A\" Tent Pitched Between Two Trees._]    [Sidenote: Don't Use a Tent Curtain]    Abercrombie & Fitch, who make this tent, will try to persuade you, if  you demand protection against mosquitoes, to let them sew on a sod-cloth  of bobbinet and a loose long curtain of the same material to cover the  entrance. Do not allow it. The rig is all right as long as there are  plenty of flies. But suppose you want to use the tent in a flyless land?  There still blocks your way that confounded curtain of bobbinet, fitting  tightly enough so that you have almost to crawl when you enter, and so  arranged that it is impossible to hang it up out of the way. The tent  itself is all right, but its fly rigging is all wrong.    [Sidenote: Best Tent Protection from Flies]    I have found that a second tent built of cheesecloth, and without any  opening whatever, is the best scheme. Tapes are sewn along its ridge.  These you tie to the ridge pole or rope of the tent--on the inside of  course. The cheesecloth structure thus hangs straight down. When not in  use it is thrust to one side or the other. If flies get thick, you  simply go inside and spread it out. It should be made somewhat larger in  the wall than the tent so that you can weight its lower edge with  fishing rods, rifles, boots, sticks, or rocks. Nothing can touch you.    [Illustration: _\"A\" Tent Pitched on Treeless Ground._]    [Sidenote: Shape of Tent]    The proper shape for a tent is a matter of some discussion. Undoubtedly  the lean-to is the ideal shelter so far as warmth goes. You build your  fire in front, the slanting wall reflects the heat down and you sleep  warm even in winter weather. In practice, however, the lean-to is not  always an undiluted joy. Flies can get in for one thing, and a heavy  rainstorm can suck around the corner for another. In these circumstances  four walls are highly desirable.    [Illustration: _Method of Tightening Rope._]    On the other hand a cold snap makes a wall tent into a cold storage  vault. Tent stoves are little devils. They are either red hot or stone  cold, and even when doing their best, there is always a northwest  corner that declines to be thawed out. A man feels the need of a camp  fire, properly constructed.    [Sidenote: \"A\" Tent the Best]    For three seasons I have come gradually to thinking that an A or wedge  tent is about the proper thing. In event of that rainstorm or those  flies its advantages are obvious. When a cold snap comes along, you  simply pull up the stakes along one side, tie the loops of that wall to  the same stakes that hold down the other wall--and there is your lean-to  all ready for the fire.    When you get your tent made, have them insert grommets in each peak.  Through these you will run a light line. By tying each end of the line  to a tree or sapling, staking out the four corners of your tent, and  then tightening the line by wedging under it (and outside the tent, of  course) a forked pole, your tent is up in a jiffy. Where you cannot find  two trees handily placed, poles crossed make good supports front and  rear. The line passes over them and to a stake in the ground. These are  quick pitches for a brief stop. By such methods an A tent is erected as  quickly as a \"pyramid,\" a miner's, or any of the others. In permanent  camp, you will cut poles and do a shipshape job.    [Illustration: _Tarpaulin, Open and Folded._]    [Sidenote: Tarpaulins]    [Sidenote: Uses of the Tarpaulin]    Often, however, you will not need to burden yourself with even as light  a tent as I have described. This is especially true on horseback trips  in the mountains. There you will carry a tarpaulin. This is a strip of  canvas or pantasote 6 x 16 or 17 feet. During the daytime it is folded  and used to protect the top packs from dust, wet, and abrasion. At  night you spread it, make your bed on one half of it, and fold the other  half over the outside. This arrangement will fend quite a shower. In  case of continued or heavy rain, you stretch a pack rope between two  trees or crossed poles, and suspend the tarp over it tent wise, tying  down the corners by means of lead ropes. Two tarps make a commodious  tent. If you happen to be alone, a saddle blanket will supplement the  tarp to give some sort of protection to your feet, and, provided it is  stretched tightly, will shed quite a downpour.    The tarp, as I have said, should measure 6 x 16. If of canvas, do not  get it too heavy, as then it will be stiff and hard to handle. About  10-ounce duck is the proper thing. After you have bought it, lay it out  on the floor folded once, as it will be when you have made your bed in  it. To the lower half and on both edges, as it lies there, sew a half  dozen snap hooks. To the upper canvas, but about six inches in from the  edge, sew corresponding rings for the snap hooks. Thus on a cold night  you can bundle yourself in without leaving cracks along the edges to  admit the chilly air.    [Sidenote: Rubber Blankets]    In the woods you will want furthermore a rubber blanket. This is  unnecessary when the tarpaulin is used. Buy a good poncho. Poor quality  sticks badly should it chance to become overheated by the sun.    [Sidenote: Blankets]    A six or seven pound blanket of the best quality is heavy enough. The  gray army blanket, to be purchased sometimes at the military stores, is  good, as is also the \"three-point\" blanket issued by the Hudson's Bay  Company. The cost is from $6 to $8. One is enough. You will find that  another suit of underwear is as warm as an extra blanket, and much  easier to carry. Sleeping bags I do not care for. They cannot be drawn  closely to the body, and the resulting air space is difficult to warm  up. A blanket you can hug close to you, thus retaining all the animal  heat. Beside which a sleeping bag is heavier and more of a bother to  keep well aired. If you like the thing occasionally, a few horse  blanket pins will make one of your blanket.    [Sidenote: To Sleep Warm]    It is the purpose of this book to deal with equipments rather than with  methods. There are a great many very competent treatises telling you how  to build your fire, pitch your tent, and all the rest of it. I have  never seen described the woodsmen's method of using a blanket, however.  Lie flat on your back. Spread the blanket over you. Now raise your legs  rigid from the hip, the blanket of course draping over them. In two  swift motions tuck first one edge under your legs from right to left,  then the second edge under from left to right, and over the first edge.  Lower your legs, wrap up your shoulders, and go to sleep. If you roll  over, one edge will unwind but the other will tighten.    [Sidenote: Quilts]    In the forest your rubber and woolen blankets will comprise your bed.  You will soften it with pine needles or balsam. On a horseback trip,  however, it is desirable to carry also an ordinary comforter, or quilt,  or \"sogun.\" You use it under you. Folded once, so as to afford two  thicknesses, it"]]]
