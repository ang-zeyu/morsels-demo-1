(Babelon.)]    11. These few indications are sufficient to give a tolerably clear idea  of what might be called \"Pleasures and hardships of an explorer's life  in the desert.\" As for the work itself, it is simple enough in the  telling, although it must have been extremely wearisome and laborious in  the performance. The simplest way to get at the contents of a mound,  would be to remove all the earth and rubbish by carting it away,--a  piece of work which our searchers might no doubt have accomplished with  great facility, had they had at their disposal a few scores of thousands  of slaves and captives, as had the ancient kings who built the huge  constructions the ruins of which had now to be disinterred. With a  hundred or two of hired workmen and very limited funds, the case was  slightly different. The task really amounted to this: to achieve the  greatest possible results at the least possible expense of labor and  time, and this is how such excavations are carried out on a plan  uniformly followed everywhere as the most practical and direct:    12. Trenches, more or less wide, are conducted from different sides  towards the centre of the mound. This is obviously the surest and  shortest way to arrive at whatever remains of walls may be imbedded in  it. But even this preliminary operation has to be carried out with some  judgment and discernment. It is known that the Chaldeans and Assyrians  constructed their palaces and temples not upon the level, natural soil,  but upon an artificial platform of brick and earth, at least thirty feet  high. This platform was faced on all sides with a strong wall of solid  burned brick, often moreover cased with stone. A trench dug straight  from the plain into the lower part of the mound would consequently be  wasted labor, since it could never bring to anything but that same blind  wall, behind which there is only the solid mass of the platform. Digging  therefore begins in the slope of the mound, at a height corresponding to  the supposed height of the platform, and is carried on straight across  its surface until a wall is reached,--a wall belonging to one of the  palaces or temples. This wall has then to be followed, till a break in  it is found, indicating an entrance or doorway.[E] The burrowing process  becomes more and more complicated, and sometimes dangerous. Shafts have  to be sunk from above at frequent intervals to introduce air and light  into the long and narrow corridor; the sides and vault have to be  propped by beams to prevent the soft earthy mass from falling in and  crushing the diggers. Every shovelful of earth cleared away is removed  in baskets which are passed from hand to hand till they are emptied  outside the trench, or else lowered empty and sent up full, through the  shafts by means of ropes and pulleys, to be emptied on the top. When a  doorway is reached, it is cleared all through the thickness of the  wall, which is very great; then a similar tunnel is conducted all along  the inside of the wall, the greatest care being needed not to damage the  sculptures which generally line it, and which, as it is, are more or  less injured and cracked, their upper parts sometimes entirely destroyed  by the action of fire. When the tunnel has been carried along the four  sides, every doorway or portal carefully noted and cleared, it is seen  from the measurements,--especially the width--whether the space explored  be an inner court, a hall or a chamber. If the latter, it is sometimes  entirely cleared from above, when the rubbish frequently yields valuable  finds in the shape of various small articles. One such chamber,  uncovered by Layard, at Koyunjik, proved a perfect mine of treasures.  The most curious relics were brought to light in it: quantities of studs  and small rosettes in mother-of-pearl, ivory and metal, (such as were  used to ornament the harness of the war-horses), bowls, cups and dishes  of bronze,[F] besides caldrons, shields and other items of armor, even  glass bowls, lastly fragments of a royal throne--possibly the very  throne on which King Sennacherib sat to give audience or pronounce  judgments, for the palace at Koyunjik where these objects were found was  built by that monarch so long familiar to us only from the Bible, and  the sculptures and inscriptions which cover its walls are the annals of  his conquests abroad and his rule at home.

THE RUINS.         \"And they said to one another, Go to, let us make brick, and       burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime       for mortar.\"--_Gen._ xi. 3.      1. It is a principle, long ago laid down and universally recognized,  that every country _makes_ its own people. That is, the mode of life and  the intellectual culture of a people are shaped by the characteristic  features of the land in which it dwells; or, in other words, men can  live only in a manner suited to the peculiarities of their native  country. Men settled along the sea-shore will lead a different life,  will develop different qualities of mind and body from the owners of  vast inland pasture-grounds or the holders of rugged mountain  fastnesses. They will all dress differently, eat different food, follow  different pursuits. Their very dwellings and public buildings will  present an entirely different aspect, according to the material which  they will have at hand in the greatest abundance, be it stone, wood or  any other substance suitable for the purpose. Thus every country will  create its own peculiar style of art, determined chiefly by its own  natural productions. On these, architecture, the art of the builder,  will be even more dependent than any other.    [Illustration: 6.--BRONZE DISH (RUG-PATTERN).]    2. It would seem as though Chaldea or Lower Mesopotamia, regarded from  this point of view, could never have originated any architecture at all,  for it is, at first sight, absolutely deficient in building materials of  any sort. The whole land is alluvial, that is, formed, gradually,  through thousands of years, of the rich mud deposited by the two  rivers, as they spread into vast marshy flats towards the end of their  course. Such soil, when hardened into sufficient consistency, is the  finest of all for cultivation, and a greater source of wealth than mines  of the most precious ore; but it bears no trees and contains no stone.  The people who were first tempted to settle in the lowlands towards the  Persian Gulf by the extraordinary fertility of that region, found  nothing at all available to construct their simple dwellings--nothing  but reeds of enormous size, which grew there, as they do now, in the  greatest profusion. These reeds \"cover the marshes in the summer-time,  rising often to the height of fourteen or fifteen feet. The Arabs of the  marsh region form their houses of this material, binding the stems  together and bending them into arches, to make the skeletons of their  buildings; while, to form the walls, they stretch across from arch to  arch mats made of the leaves.\"[G]    [Illustration: 7.--SECTION OF BRONZE DISH.]    3. There can be no doubt that of such habitations consisted the villages  and towns of those first settlers. They gave quite sufficient shelter in  the very mild winters of that region, and, when coated with a layer of  mud which soon dried and hardened in the sun, could exclude even the  violent rains of that season. But they were in no way fitted for more  ambitious and dignified purposes. Neither the palaces of the kings nor  the temples of the gods could be constructed out of bent reeds.  Something more durable must be found, some material that would lend  itself to constructions of any size or shape. The mud coating of the  cabins naturally suggested such a material. Could not this same mud or  clay, of which an inexhaustible supply was always on hand, be moulded  into cakes of even size, and after being left to dry in the sun, be  piled into walls of the required height and thickness? And so men began  to make bricks. It was found that the clay gained much in consistency  when mixed with finely chopped straw--another article of which the  country, abounding in wheat and other grains, yielded unlimited  quantities. But even with this improvement the sun-dried bricks could  not withstand the continued action of many rainy seasons, or many  torrid summers, but had a tendency to crumble away when parched too dry,  or to soak and dissolve back into mud, when too long exposed to rain.  All these defects were removed by the simple expedient of baking the  bricks in kilns or ovens, a process which gives them the hardness and  solidity of stone. But as the cost of kiln-dried bricks is naturally  very much greater than that of the original crude article, so the latter  continued to be used in far greater quantities; the walls were made  entirely of them and only protected by an outward casing of the hard  baked bricks. These being so much more expensive, and calculated to last  forever, great care was bestowed on their preparation; the best clay "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#8)"],[1,"glorious fjord.            CHAPTER IX    A GLIMPSE OF THE FJELDS      \"Fjeld-weather\" is the Norwegian term for fine, warm, bright days. It  implies that the weather is suitable for a tour on the mountains. But,  alas! it is not the weather that is always encountered there, for  even in the summer the climate of the high plateau is ever varying,  and though there may be a long spell of fine, hot weather, with  a glorious crisp air, yet at any moment a change of the wind may  bring a week of soaking rain, sleet, possibly snow, and a fall of  temperature by twenty degrees. That is no time for the fjelds, and  the traveller is better off in a fjordside hotel.    Given fine weather, there is no more splendid touring ground than the  highlands of Norway, where, at a height of anything up to 4,000 or  5,000 feet above the sea, stretch thousands of square miles of wild and  uninhabited moorland, cut up with numerous large lakes, and clothed  only with a dwarf vegetation. Such parts usually lie off the beaten  track, and to reach them means an expedition--heavy, uphill walking  for two or three days, with the baggage carried on the backs of ponies.    If you were going to undertake an expedition to these high fjelds,  you would probably make a start from the lowlands by following  some well-worn track leading to a saeter. In nine cases out of ten  the track will be running by the side of a river, at first wide and  flowing lazily through the valley, but soon narrowing, until its upper  waters become a rushing mountain torrent, swishing between mighty  boulders. After a while you find that the path gradually begins to  ascend by zigzags up the mountain-side, and the scenery, whenever  you pause to look down, is magnificent. In time you reach the upland  pastures, with here and there a saeter-dwelling, and this is the end  of the first stage of your journey, for you probably will have climbed  some 2,000 feet and walked a dozen miles or more. Thus you will be glad  enough to accept the hospitality offered to you by the simple peasants.    All these saeter-huts are much alike, though, of course, they vary  in size and in the way in which they are fitted up; but as they are  only occupied during the summer months, luxurious fittings are not  considered a necessity. The outer walls are constructed of fir-trunks,  let into one another at the corners on the log-hut principle, and  the interior is lined with boarding. In some parts, however, where  timber is scarce the buildings are of stone.    The roof consists of rough planks, on which is placed a layer of  birch-bark to fill in the cracks; and on the top, again, are laid  sods of earth to a thickness of about a foot. Grass and weeds soon  cover the roof, binding it together and keeping the rain out.    The door opens into a dark hall or chamber, which serves as a  receptacle for rubbish of all kinds--fishing-nets, tools, skins,  empty milk-pans, and the like; and in the corner is a roughly-built  fireplace for boiling the milk and for cooking. On one side of this  hall is the door into the sole living apartment, which possesses  a window at one end, and against one of the side walls a couple of  bunks, wherein three or four dairymaids sleep.    Sometimes there is a separate room, or even a detached hut,  for the dairy work; but there is generally only the one room,  the milk being set in large, shallow wooden vessels on a number of  shelves fixed against one of the walls. Everything is scrupulously  clean, and the cattle women are working hard all the long daylight  hours. Periodically a man from the farm in the lowlands comes up to  the saeter with a couple of ponies and takes down butter and cheese,  and such visits are the only excitement in saeter-life.    If you have time to linger here for a day or two you will be made  welcome, and you will find plenty to interest you. The views down into  the deep valleys and away to the fjords in the distance are always  delightful, and there may be a stream with pools holding trout worth  trying for. The tiny rivulets which trickle down from the hills are  lined with ferns and forget-me nots, and elsewhere may be seen flowers  of every hue--red Alpine catchfly, blue meadow cranesbill, hawksweed,  wild radis, and a score of other pretty things.    But the greatest joy of all is the sight of a wide marsh covered with  the delicious _multebaer_, whose luscious, yellow fruit and gold-red  leaves brighten the country-side. This is the cloudberry, found in  Scotland and in the North of England, and to come on a stretch of  this fruit after a long, hot walk is a thing worth living for. Besides  this best of all Norse wild fruits, the fjelds produce many excellent  berries, such as crowberries, whortleberries, marsh whortleberries,  bearberries, dewberries, cranberries, and others. The children of the  country parts all over Norway spend much of their time in feasting  on these little fruits, and during the summer and autumn months their  hands and faces are generally well stained with the dark juice.    Upwards, beyond these pleasant pastures, when you have left behind  the last saeter-shanty and the last thicket of birches, you reach a  world where, except for the scattered Tourist Club huts and their  summer caretakers, you cannot count on coming across either dwelling  or human being.    Wandering far afield, you may meet a couple of Lapps with their herd  of reindeer, and down by one of the tarns you may chance on a rough  stone shelter, inhabited for the time being by two Norwegian fishermen,  whose nets are laid in the mountain lake.    All over this lofty wilderness the snow lies deep for several months  of the year, but as soon as it begins to thaw it disappears rapidly,  when, as in Switzerland, Nature's garden immediately blossoms forth  in all its glory. It must be confessed, however, that the carpet of  Alpine flowers on the Norwegian high-fjelds cannot compare with that of  Switzerland. On the great mountain plateau of Norway everything gives  way to the lichen-like reindeer moss, and the flowers are merely in  patches, or growing in masses only in those swampy parts where the  moss does not thrive.    The fjelds furnish a recreation-ground for the Norwegian  townsman. There he can lead the life that he loves best, and one week  of the wilds will set him up for the remainder of the year. Even though  he cares nothing for shooting or fishing, the sense of freedom as he  does his daily tramp delights his soul. And his wife or his sister as  often as not will accompany him, for the Norwegian ladies are brave  walkers, and know how to rough it.    But the majority of Norsemen are good sportsmen and good fishermen,  and in most seasons there are plenty of fjeld-ryper to be shot and good  hauls of trout to be made in the mountain lakes and connecting streams.    But what is the country like up here on the very summit of  everything? It is called a plateau; but that does not mean that it  is absolutely level, for, as a matter of fact, there is no part of  it level enough to be made into a football ground. It is all up and  down, and every here and there are low hills, with occasionally great  prominent, rounded mountain-tops, rising to a height of 500 or 600  feet above the plateau. Then there are chains of lakes, often several  miles in length, acres of swampy ground in every direction, shallow  ravines filled with a jumble of rocks and boulders, and constant sand  mounds, partly overgrown with grass and dwarf juniper. And up here  are the snowfields, about which we shall have more to say presently.    It is all weird and wild and wonderful, and if there be no wind the  silence is intense, and only broken by the bark of an Arctic fox from  some rocky hillside or by the plaintive call of a golden plover.    Why, it may be asked, should anyone wish to go to such a desolate  place? Only to shoot or to fish, to gather in a store of the purest  air in the world, or perhaps to enjoy a period of calm and quiet  solitude--world-forgetting, by the world forgot.            CHAPTER X    WILD NATURE--BEASTS      In a country like Norway, with its vast forests and waste moorlands,  it is only natural to find a considerable variety of animals and  birds. Some of these are peculiar to Scandinavia. Some, though only  occasionally met with in the British Isles, are not rare in Norway;  whilst others (more especially among the birds) are equally common  in both countries.    There was a time when the people of England lived in a state of fear  and dread of the ravages of wolves and bears, and the Norwegians of  the country districts even now have to guard their flocks and herds  from these destroyers. Except in the forest tracts of the Far North,  however, bears are not numerous, but in some parts, even in the South,  they are sufficiently so to be a nuisance, and are ruthlessly hunted  down by the farmers. As far as wolves are concerned civilization is,  fortunately, driving them farther afield each year, and only in the  most out-of-the-way parts are they ever encountered nowadays. Stories  of packs of hungry wolves following in the wake of a sleigh are still  told to the children in Norway, but they relate to bygone times--half  a century or more ago, and such wild excitements no longer enter into  the Norsemen's lives.    Yet less ferocious animals give the people trouble enough, and  amongst these may be mentioned the lynx and the wolverine, or glutton,  each of which will make his supper off a sheep or a goat if he gets  the chance. Of the two the lynx is perhaps the worse poacher, and  his proverbial sharpness renders him difficult to catch. Not so the  glutton, who, if he succeeds in crawling through a hole in the fence  of a sheepfold, stuffs himself so full that he cannot get out again. I  think that most of us would rather be called lynx-eyed than gluttonous,  and certainly a lynx is a much handsomer beast than a glutton."]]]
