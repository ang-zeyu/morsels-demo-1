At  first it is a monotonous ditty, says Nuttall, uttered in a strong but  shrill and filing tone. These notes, as the season advances, become  more mellow and warbling.    The Warbler's movements in search of food are very interesting to the  observer. Keeping the feet together they move in a succession of  short, rapid hops up the trunks of trees and along the limbs, passing  again to the bottom by longer flights than in the ascent. They make  but short flight from tree to tree, but are capable of flying far when  they choose.    They build on the ground. One nest containing young about a week old  was found on the surface of shelving rock. It was made of coarse  strips of bark, soft decayed leaves, and dry grasses, and lined with a  thin layer of black hair. The parents fed their young in the presence  of the observer with affectionate attention, and showed no uneasiness,  creeping head downward about the trunks of the neighboring trees, and  carrying large smooth caterpillars to their young.    They search the crevices in the bark of the tree trunks and branches,  look among the undergrowth, and hunt along the fences for bunches  of eggs, the buried larvae of the insects, which when undisturbed,  hatch out millions of creeping, crawling, and flying things that  devastate garden and orchard and every crop of the field.

But nobody thought of talking to old dog Spot. Every  one forgot about him. And he was just as badly frightened as the bays,  especially when a terrible tooting and screeching burst forth.    Spot jumped almost out of his skin.    \"Sakes alive!\" he howled. \"What awful voices the elephants have!\"    \"The steam calliope!\" Johnnie Green cried. \"And that's the end of the  parade.\"          XXII    THE CIRCUS GROUNDS      The Green family ate their luncheon in the carryall on Main Street,  after the circus parade had passed. They didn't forget to give old dog  Spot something to eat out of the big basket that they had brought with  them from home. Although they hadn't expected him to go to the village  with them, there was more than enough food for everybody. Even Johnnie  Green's appetite wasn't equal to all the goodies that his mother had  provided.    People were already starting for the circus grounds on the outskirts of  the village. Johnnie Green noticed them uneasily.    \"We don't want to be late for the show,\" he reminded his father.    \"We'll get there in time,\" Farmer Green assured him.    And they did. Soon they followed the crowd through the village streets  until they came in sight of the \"big top,\" the great tent with flags  flying above it, and smaller tents all around.    Farmer Green turned the bays into a yard near-by, where he unharnessed  and fed them. Then he tied one end of a rope to Spot's collar and  fastened the other end to a carriage wheel.    \"There!\" he said. \"Now we're ready.\"    Old dog Spot didn't want to be left behind. He tugged at the rope and  whined.    \"Be quiet!\" Johnnie Green's father said to him. \"You followed us to the  village. And now you'll have to behave yourself. They wouldn't let you  into the show.\"    Then the Green family turned their backs on him.    \"They needn't think they can keep me here,\" Spot growled. \"I didn't run  all the way from the farm to the village to be tied to a wagon wheel.\"    Johnnie Green and his father and mother hadn't been gone a quarter of an  hour when Spot succeeded in slipping his collar over his head. Then he  dashed out of the yard and ran to the circus grounds as fast as he could  go.    Spot mingled with the crowds of people that were pouring into the big  tent. He worked his way in and out among the throng, all but tripping  many of the pleasure seekers.    Though he looked everywhere, he couldn't find the Green family. They had  already passed through the entrance and were enjoying the sights inside  the canvas.    At last Spot met a man--a circus man--who was very friendly. It was  pleasant to get a kind word from somebody, after so many people had told  him to \"get out,\" and had given him a shove.    This kindly person called Spot into a low tent and patted him. He gave  Spot a bit of meat and even thought to offer him a drink of water.    \"This is a fine pointer,\" the man remarked to a friend of his who was  with him. \"He hasn't any collar; so he must be anybody's dog. And he  might as well be mine.\"    Spot wagged his tail. He didn't quite understand what his new  acquaintance was saying. But it seemed to be something nice.    And then Spot decided, suddenly, that he had stayed in that tent long  enough. For the pleasant man found a piece of rope and tried to tie it  about Spot's neck.    \"I've been tied up once to-day; and once is enough,\" Spot growled.  Slipping out of the man's grasp, Spot ran out of doors.    Both men followed him. For a few minutes they chased him. One of them  tripped over a guy rope and sprawled on the ground. And to escape the  other Spot dodged under a canvas wall where it lifted slightly at the  bottom.    He found himself in a huge tent where hundreds of people sat all around  on tiers of seats. Men and horses were capering about in the center of  the place. And somewhere a band was playing.    He was under the big top.          XXIII    SPOT SEES THE SHOW      Old dog Spot was bewildered. When he crawled under the canvas he had not  dreamed that he was entering the main tent of the circus. He saw so many  strange sights that he didn't know whether to bark or to crawl away and  hide somewhere. Yet among all those people he felt lonely. He couldn't  see anybody he knew.    All at once the bandsmen began to play louder than ever. They seemed to  be trying to burst their horns--or themselves. And men in flowing robes,  each one standing in a sort of little two-wheeled cart and driving four  horses abreast, came tearing past the place where Spot was standing.    It was a race! And if there was one thing that Spot liked more than  another it was a race of any kind. He gave a few delighted barks and ran  after the galloping horses.    Spot followed them twice around the big tent. And just as he fell into a  jog--for the race was finished--he heard a whistle that gave him a great  thrill. He stood still for an instant. Then he dashed toward the nearest  seats.    A moment later he was fawning upon Johnnie Green, who sat in the lowest  row and seemed as glad to see Spot as Spot was to see him.    Lying between Johnnie's feet, Spot watched the rest of the show.    At last the circus was over. The Green family, with Spot at their heels,  went back to the place where they had left the bays and the carryall.  And in a few minutes more they were on their way back to Pleasant Valley  and home.    That morning everybody on the road had seemed to be in a great hurry to  get to the village. And now, late in the afternoon, everybody was in  just as great a hurry to get away from it. Farmer Green kept the bays at  a spanking trot, only pausing to let them breathe now and then on the  hills.    Spot, however, was not in such haste that he didn't stop and give a good  trouncing to the dog that had rushed out at him earlier in the day. Spot  sent the surly fellow yelping into his master's yard. Then he rushed  down the road to overtake the carryall.    But, to everybody's surprise, when they reached home old dog Spot was  missing.    \"He'll come back,\" Farmer Green said. \"Probably he's stopped somewhere  to chase a rabbit or something. He'll be along after a while.\"    But after the cows were milked old Spot was still absent. And after the  family had eaten supper he had failed to appear. Bedtime came. Still no  Spot!    Johnnie Green felt very sad when he went upstairs.    He felt even worse when morning came. He had hoped that Spot would be in  the yard, begging for his breakfast.    Johnnie Green was able to eat only a little of his own breakfast. And as  soon as he left the table he went to the barn and harnessed his pony,  Twinkleheels, to the little buggy with the red wheels.    Then Johnnie started for the village.          XXIV    HOME AGAIN      Johnnie Green drove his pony, Twinkleheels, back over the road that led  to the village. Now and then he stopped at a farmhouse to inquire  whether anybody had seen old dog Spot, who had vanished on the way home  from the circus the evening before.    Nobody had set eyes on him. And Johnnie Green drove on and on, feeling  more and more miserable all the while.    At last, as he turned a sharp bend of the road, he heard a bark. There  was no mistaking it. It was Spot's.    There was a joyful meeting then. Johnnie sprang out of the buggy and  Spot sprang into his arms. And Johnnie hugged the old fellow tightly,  right there in the middle of the road.    \"What in the world has kept you here ever since yesterday?\" Johnnie  asked.    Spot must have understood. Anyhow, he dashed to one side of the road.  And, following him, Johnnie found there a robe that belonged to his  father. It had dropped out of the carryall the evening before, when the  Green family were on their way home from seeing the circus. Nobody in  the carriage had missed it. But old Spot, running under the carriage,  had seen it fall. And he had stayed behind to guard it all through the  long night.    Of course Spot couldn't tell Johnnie Green all this. But Johnnie wasn't  slow in guessing what had happened.    He picked up the robe and put it under the seat of the little buggy.  Then he and Spot both jumped in. And Johnnie turned Twinkleheels' head  toward home.    Back at the farm almost everybody said that old dog Spot was a hero.  Farmer Green exclaimed that Spot was a faithful old fellow. And Mrs.  Green set out such a meal for him as Spot had never seen before in all  his life.    Now, there were two or three of Spot's neighbors in the farmyard that  didn't like the praise he was getting. Turkey Proudfoot, the gobbler,  remarked that if people didn't know enough to come home to roost at  night he saw no reason for making a fuss about it. Miss Kitty Cat  declared that so far as she was concerned she would have been just as  well pleased if Spot hadn't come back to the farm at all. And Henrietta  Hen had more to say than anyone else. She hurried up to old dog Spot  himself and insisted on talking with him.    \"Huh!\" she exclaimed. \"You only spent one day at the circus, while last  fall I stayed a whole week at the county fair.\"    \"Did you hear a band at the fair?\" Spot asked her.    \"Yes!\"    \"Did you see any races?\"    \"There were races every day; but I didn't care to watch them,\" Henrietta  Hen answered.    \"Did you see any elephants at the fair?\" Spot demanded.    \"Elephants?\" said Henrietta Hen. \"What are elephants?\"    Spot pointed--with his nose--to one of the posters on the barn.    \"There's a picture of some elephants,\" he told her. \"And I must say it's  a good one.\"    \"There were no elephants at the county fair,\" Henrietta Hen admitted as  she gazed at the circus poster on the side of the barn. \"Why, every one  of them has two tails!\" she cried. \"I don't see how they know whether  they're going backward or forward.\"    \"Maybe they don't know,\" Spot retorted. \"Maybe that's part of the fun in  being an elephant. For I suppose "]]]
