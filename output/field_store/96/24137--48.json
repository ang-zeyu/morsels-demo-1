Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the  functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal  contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,  abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.  Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or  water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained  high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.  vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected  arthropod:  Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;  transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;  parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in  cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to  damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;  endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the  majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-  Saharan Africa.  Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe  headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death  in 5% of cases.  Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from  influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;  occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where  most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.  Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral  disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can  progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.  African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma;  transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies;  infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases  when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death;  endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals  act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.  Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania;  transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin  lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases  occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild  and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of  infection.  Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated  with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent  plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America  associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as  fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses  rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a  death rate in excess of 50%.  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease; infection  may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue;  geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and  Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches  followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums;  mortality rate is approximately 30%.  Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and  humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection  may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood;  geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where  cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and  some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic  fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about  1% of cases.  Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by  sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7  days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.  water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in  freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:  Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;  infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated  by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache,  vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in  kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress;  fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.  Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma;  fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of  parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated  water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys,  and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues  triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or  intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity;  mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due  to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of  infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the  reservoir for this parasite.  aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of  aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:  Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;  endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct  contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or  fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in  epidemic outbreaks.  respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious  person:  Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of  the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important  bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential  to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches,  and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by  respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact  resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal  distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48  hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease  occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the  \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.  animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local  animals:  Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite  of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central  nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially  are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological  symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.    Manpower available for military service  This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and  assumes that every individual is fit to serve.    Manpower fit for military service  This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for  military service. This is a more refined measure of potential military  manpower availability which tries to account for the health situation  in the country and reduces the maximum potential number to a more  realistic estimate of the actual number fit to serve.    Manpower reaching military service age annually  This entry gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the  military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the  availability of draft-age young adults.    Map references  This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which a  country may be found. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be  helpful in finding some smaller countries.    Maritime claims  This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which are  excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive descriptions:  territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its  land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,  described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this  sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well  as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to  establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not  exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the  breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as  marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal  state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.  contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone  contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may  exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs,  fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its  territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and  regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the  contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured  (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition  to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea).  exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as  a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal  state has:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],[0,"Vaninka (#8)"],[1,"me that he has given  much proof of ambition in entering my service; for after his  achievements in the last campaign he might easily have aspired to the  honour of a place in the emperor's household.\"    \"Oh yes, he is ambitious,\" said Gregory, smiling. \"One man's ambition is  for high position, another's an illustrious alliance: the former will  owe everything to himself, the latter will make a stepping-stone of his  wife, then they raise their eyes higher than they should.\"    \"What do you mean to suggest?\" said the general, beginning to see what  Gregory was aiming at.    \"I mean, your excellency,\" replied Gregory, \"there are many men who,  owing to the kindness shown them by others, forget their position and  aspire to a more exalted one; having already been placed so high, their  heads are turned.\"    \"Gregory,\" cried the general, \"believe me, you are getting into a  scrape; for you are making an accusation, and if I take any notice of  it, you will have to prove your words.\"    \"By St. Basilius, general, it is no scrape when you have truth on your  side; for I have said nothing I am not ready to prove.\"    \"Then,\" said the general, \"you persist in declaring that Foedor loves my  daughter?\"    \"Ah! I have not said that: it is your excellency. I have not named the  lady Vaninka,\" said Gregory, with the duplicity of his nation.    \"But you meant it, did you not? Come, contrary to your custom, reply  frankly.\"    \"It is true, your excellency; it is what I meant.\"    \"And, according to you, my daughter reciprocates the passion, no doubt?\"    \"I fear so, your excellency.\"    \"And what makes you think this, say?\"    \"First, Mr. Foedor never misses a chance of speaking to the lady  Vaninka.\"    \"He is in the same house with her, would you have him avoid her?\"    \"When the lady Vaninka returns late, and when perchance Mr. Foedor has  not accompanied you, whatever the hour Mr. Foedor is there, ready, to  help her out of the carriage.\"    \"Foedor attends me, it is his duty,\" said the general, beginning to  believe that the serf's suspicions were founded on slight grounds. \"He  waits for me,\" he, continued, \"because when I return, at any hour of the  day or night, I may have orders to give him.\"    \"Not a day passes without Mr. Foedor going into my lady Vaninka's room,  although such a favour is not usually granted to a young man in a house  like that of your excellency.\"    \"Usually it is I who send him to her,\" said the general.    \"Yes, in the daytime,\" replied Gregory, \"but at night?\"    \"At night!\" cried the general, rising to his feet, and turning so pale  that, after a moment, he was forced to lean for support on a table.    \"Yes, at night, your excellency,\" answered Gregory quietly; \"and since,  as you say, I have begun to mix myself up in a bad business, I must go  on with it; besides, even if there were to result from it another  punishment for me, even more terrible than that I have already endured,  I should not allow so good, a master to be deceived any longer.\"    \"Be very careful about what you are going to say, slave; for I know the  men of your nation. Take care, if the accusation you are making by way  of revenge is not supported by visible, palpable, and positive proofs,  you shall be punished as an infamous slanderer.\"    \"To that I agree,\" said Gregory.    \"Do you affirm that you have seen Foedor enter my daughter's chamber at  night?\"    \"I do not say that I have seen him enter it, your excellency. I say that  I have seen him come out.\"    \"When was that?\"    \"A quarter of an hour ago, when I was on my way to your excellency.\"    \"You lie!\" said the general, raising his fist.    \"This is not our agreement, your excellency,\" said the slave, drawing  back. \"I am only to be punished if I fail to give proofs.\"    \"But what are your proofs?\"    \"I have told you.\"    \"And do you expect me to believe your word alone?\"    \"No; but I expect you to believe your own eyes.\"    \"How?\"    \"The first time that Mr. Foedor is in my lady Vaninka's room after  midnight, I shall come to find your excellency, and then you can judge  for yourself if I lie; but up to the present, your excellency, all the  conditions of the service I wish to render you are to my disadvantage.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"Well, if I fail to give proofs, I am to be treated as an infamous  slanderer; but if I give them, what advantage shall I gain?\"    \"A thousand roubles and your freedom.\"    \"That is a bargain, then, your excellency,\" replied Gregory quietly,  replacing the razors on the general's toilet-table, \"and I hope that  before a week has passed you will be more just to me than you are now.\"    With these words the slave left the room, leaving the general convinced  by his confidence that some dreadful misfortune threatened him.    From this time onward, as might be expected, the general weighed every  word and noticed every gesture which passed between Vaninka and Foedor  in his presence; but he saw nothing to confirm his suspicions on the  part of the aide-de-camp or of his daughter; on the contrary, Vaninka  seemed colder and more reserved than ever.    A week passed in this way. About two o'clock in the morning of the ninth  day, someone knocked at the general's door. It was Gregory.    \"If your excellency will go into your daughter's room,\" said Gregory,  \"you will find Mr. Foedor there.\"    The general turned pale, dressed himself without uttering a word, and  followed the slave to the door of Vaninka's room. Having arrived there,  with a motion of his hand he dismissed the informer, who, instead of  retiring in obedience to this mute command, hid himself in the corner of  the corridor.    When the general believed himself to be alone, he knocked once; but all  was silent. This silence, however, proved nothing; for Vaninka might be  asleep. He knocked a second time, and the young girl, in a perfectly  calm voice, asked, \"Who is there?\"    \"It is I,\" said the general, in a voice trembling with emotion.    \"Annouschka!\" said the girl to her foster-sister, who slept in the  adjoining room, \"open the door to my father. Forgive me, father,\" she  continued; \"but Annouschka is dressing, and will be with you in a  moment.\"    The general waited patiently, for he could discover no trace of emotion  in his daughter's voice, and he hoped that Gregory had been mistaken.    In a few moments the door opened, and the general went in, and cast a  long look around him; there was no one in this first apartment.    Vaninka was in bed, paler perhaps than usual, but quite calm, with the  loving smile on her lips with which she always welcomed her father.    \"To what fortunate circumstance,\" asked the young girl in her softest  tones, \"do I owe the pleasure of seeing you at so late an hour?\"    \"I wished to speak to you about a very important matter,\" said the  general, \"and however late it was, I thought you would forgive me for  disturbing you.\"    \"My father will always be welcome in his daughter's room, at whatever  hour of the day or night he presents himself there.\"    The general cast another searching look round, and was convinced that it  was impossible for a man to be concealed in the first room--but the  second still remained.    \"I am listening,\" said Vaninka, after a moment of silence.    \"Yes, but we are not alone,\" replied the general, \"and it is important  that no other ears should hear what I have to say to you.\"    \"Annauschka, as you know, is my foster-sister,\" said Vaninka.    \"That makes no difference,\" said the general, going candle in hand into  the next room, which was somewhat smaller than his daughter's.  \"Annouschka,\" said he, \"watch in the corridor and see that no one  overhears us.\"    As he spoke these words, the general threw the same scrutinizing glance  all round the room, but with the exception of the young girl there was  no one there.    Annouschka obeyed, and the general followed her out, and, looking  eagerly round for the last time, re-entered his daughter's room, and  seated himself on the foot of her bed. Annouschka, at a sign from her  mistress, left her alone with her father. The general held out his hand  to Vaninka, and she took it without hesitation.    \"My child,\" said the general, \"I have to speak to you about a very  important matter.\"    \"What is it, father?\" said Vaninka.    \"You will soon be eighteen,\" continued the general, \"and that is the age  at which the daughters of the Russian nobility usually marry.\" The  general paused for a moment to watch the effect of these words upon  Vaninka, but her hand rested motionless in his. \"For the last year your  hand has been engaged by me,\" continued the general.    \"May I know to whom?\" asked Vaninka coldly.    \"To the son of the Councillor-in-Ordinary,\" replied the general. \"What  is your opinion of him?\"    \"He is a worthy and noble young man, I am told, but I can have formed no  opinion except from hearsay. Has he not been in garrison at Moscow for  the last three months?\"    \"Yes,\" said the general, \"but in three months' time he should return.\"    Vaninka remained silent.    \"Have you nothing to say in reply?\" asked the general.    \"Nothing, father; but I have a favour to ask of you.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I do not wish to marry until I am twenty years old.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I have taken a vow to that effect.\"    \"But if circumstances demanded the breaking of this vow, and made the  celebration of this marriage imperatively necessary?\"    \"What circumstances?\" asked Vaninka.    \"Foedor loves you,\" said the general, looking steadily at Vaninka.    \"I know that,\" said Vaninka, with as little emotion as if the question  did not concern her.    \"You know that!\" cried the general.    \"Yes; he has told me so.\"    \"When?\"    \"Yesterday.\"    \"And you replied--?\"    \"That he must leave here at once.\"    \"And he consented?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"When does he go?\"    \"He has gone.\"    \"How can that be?\" said the general: \"he only left me at ten o'clock.\"    \""]]]
