[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#8)"],[1," the one member of the trio  who had learned from birth to judge by sound and by scent, rather than  by mere sight.    With no good grace, the Master yanked off his own coat and waistcoat,  and bent to unstrap his hiking boots. He did not relish the prospect of  a wetting, for the mere sake of saving from death this atrocious  trespasser. He knew the man could probably keep afloat for at least a  minute longer. And he was not minded to shorten the period of fear by  ripping off his own outer garments with any melodramatic haste.    As he undid the first boot-latchet, he felt the Mistress's tense  fingers on his shoulder.    \"Wait!\" she exhorted    Astounded at this cold-blooded counsel from his tender-hearted wife, he  looked up, and followed the direction of her eagerly pointing hand.    \"Look!\" she was exulting. \"It'll all solve itself! See if it doesn't.  Look! He can't shoot Laddie, after--after--\"    The Master was barely in time to see Lad swirl along the dock with  express-train speed and spring far out into the lake.    The dog struck water, a bare ten inches from Wefers' madly tossing  head. The constable, in his crazy panic, flung both bony arms about the  dog. And, man and collie together disappeared under the surface, in a  swirl of churned foam.    The Mistress cried aloud, at this hideous turn her pretty plan had  taken. The Master, one shoe off and one shoe on, hobbled at top pace  toward the dock.    As he reached the foot of the lawn, Lad's head and shoulders came into  view above the little whirlpool caused by the sinking bodies' suction.  And, at the same moment, the convulsed features of Homer Wefers showed  through the eddy. The man was thrashing and twisting in a way that  turned the lake around him into a white maelstrom.    As the Master set foot on the dock he saw the Collie rush forward with  an impetus that sent both shaggy mahogany shoulders far out of water.  Striking with brilliant accuracy, the dog avoided Wefers' flailing arms  and feet, and clinched his strong teeth into the back of the drowning  man's collar.    Thus, Lad was safe from the blindly clinging arms and from a kick. He  had chosen the one strategic hold; and he maintained it. A splashing of  the unwieldy body made both heads vanish under water, for a bare  half-second, as the Master poised himself on the string-piece for a  dive. But the dive was not made.    For the heads reappeared. And now, whether from palsy of fright or from  belated intelligence,--Wefers ceased his useless struggles; though not  his strangled shrieks for help. The collie, calling on all his wiry  power, struck out for the dock; keeping the man's face above water, and  tugging at his soggy weight with a scientific strength that sent the  two, slowly but steadily, shoreward.    After the few feet of the haul, Wefers went silent. Into his blankly  affrighted face came a look of foolish bewilderment. The Master,  remembering his wife's hint, and certain now of Lad's ability to  complete the rescue, stood waiting on the string-piece. Once, for a  second, Wefers' eyes met his; but they were averted in queer haste.    As Lad tugged his burden beneath the stringpiece, the Master bent down  and gripped the sodden wet shoulders of the constable. One  none-too-gentle heave, and Wefers was lying in a panting and dripping  heap on the clean dock. Lad, relieved of his heavy load, swam leisurely  around to shore. It had been a delightfully thrilling day, thus far,  for the collie. But he was just a bit tired.    By the time the dazed constable was able to sit up and peer owlishly  into the unloving faces of the Mistress and the Master, Lad had shaken  himself thrice and was pattering across the dock toward the group. From  the two humans, Wefers' gaze shifted to the oncoming dog. Then he  glanced back at the sullen depths of lake water beyond the  string-piece. Then he let his head sink on his chest. For perhaps a  whole minute, he sat thus; his eyes shut, his breath still fast and  hysterical.    Nobody spoke. The Mistress looked down at the drenched man. Then she  winked at the equally silent Master, and laid a caressing little hand  on Lad's wet head. At length, Wefers lifted his face and glowered at  the trio. But, as his eye met Lad's quizzically interested gaze, he  fidgeted.    \"Well?\" prompted the Master, \"do you want those cartridges back?\"    Wefers favored him with a scowl of utter dislike. Then, his eyes again  averted, the wet man mumbled:    \"I come over here today, to do my dooty.--Dogs that get bit by mad dogs  had ought to be shot.--I come over here to do my dooty. Likewise, I  done it.--I shot that dog of yours that got bit, yest'day.\"    \"Huh?\" ejaculated the Master.    \"This dog here looks some like him,\" went on Wefers, sulkily. \"But it  ain't him. And I'll so report to the author'ties.--I done what I come  to do. The case is closed. And-and-if you folks ever want to sell your  dog, why,--well, I'll just go mortgage something and--and buy him off'n  you!\"        CHAPTER III. No Trespassing!    There were four of them; two gaudily-clad damsels and two men. The men,  in their own way, were attired as gloriously as the maidens they were  escorting.  The quartet added generously to the glowing beauty of the  summer day.    Down the lake they came, in a canoe modestly scarlet except for a  single broad purple stripe under the gunwale. The canoe's tones blended  sweetly with the pink parasol and blue picture hat of one of the women.    Stolid and unshaven fishermen, in drab scows, along the canoe's route,  looked up from their lines, in bovine wonder at the vision of  loveliness which swept resonantly past them. For the quartet were  warbling. They were also doing queer musical stunts which are fondly  miscalled \"close harmony.\"    Thus do they and their kind pay homage to a divine day on a fire-blue  lake, amid the hush of the eternal hills. Lesser souls may find  themselves speaking in few and low-pitched words, under the holy spell  of such surroundings. But to loftier types of holiday-seekers, the  benignant silences of the wilderness are put there by an all-wise  Providence for the purpose of being fractured by any racket denoting  care-free merriment;--the louder the merrier. There is nothing so  racket-breeding as a perfect day amid perfect scenery.    The four revelers had paddled down into the lake, on a day's  picnicking. They had come from far up the Ramapo river; beyond Suffern.  And the long downstream jaunt had made them hungry. Wherefore, as they  reached mid-lakes they began to inspect the wooded shores for an  attractive luncheon-site. And they found what they sought.    A half-mile to southward, a gently rolling point of land pushed out  into the lake. It was smooth-shaven and emerald-bright. It formed the  lower end of a lawn; sloping gently downward, a hundred yards or more,  from a gray old house which nestled happily among mighty oaks on a  plateau at the low hill's summit.    The point (with its patch of beach-sand at the water's edge, and with  comfortable shade from a lakeside tree or so), promised an ideal  picnic-ground. The shaven grass not only offered fine possibilities for  an after-luncheon snooze; but was the most convenient sort of place for  the later strewing of greasy newspapers and Japanese napkins and wooden  platters and crusts and chicken bones and the like.    Moreover, a severely plain \"No Trespass\" sign, at the lake-margin,  would serve as ideal kindling for a jolly little camp-fire. There is  always a zest in using trespass boards for picnic fires. Not only are  they seasoned and painted in a way to cause quick ignition, but people  laugh so appreciatively, when one tells, afterward, of the bit of  jovial audacity.    Yes, this point was just the place for luncheon and for siesta. It  might have been made to order. And by tacit consent the two paddlers  sent their multi-chrome canoe sweeping toward it. Five minutes later,  they had helped the girls ashore and were lifting out the lunch-basket  and various newspaper parcels and the red-and-purple cushions.    With much laughter and a snatch or two of close harmony, the lunch was  spread. One of the men picked out a place for the fire (against the  trunk of a two-century oak; perhaps the millionth noble old tree to be  threatened thus with death from care-free picnickers' fires) and the  other man sauntered across to the trespass board to annex it for  kindling.    Everything was so happy and so complete and everyone was having such a  perfect time! Into such moments Fate loves best to toss Trouble. And,  this day, Fate played true to form.    As the fire-maker's hand was laid on the trespass board, even as his  inconsequential muscles were braced to rip it loose from its post,--a  squeal from the girl in the blue picture hat and the Nile-green  georgette waist, checked his mirthful activities.    Now, there was nothing remarkable in the fact that the chromatic lass  had squealed. Indeed, she and her equally fair companion had been  squealing at intervals, all morning. But there was nothing coquettish  or gay about this particular squeal. It savored rather of a screech. In  its shrill note was a tiny thread of terror. And the two men wheeled  about, to look.    The blue-hatted girl had paused in her dainty labor of helping to  spread out the lunch; in order to peep inquisitively up the slope  toward the tree-framed house above. It might be fun, after eating, to  stroll up there and squint in through the veranda windows; or,--if no  one was at home, to gather an armful of the roses that clambered over  one end of the porch.    During that brief exploratory glance, her eye had been caught by  something moving through the woods beyond.    Behind the house, these woods ran up to the highroad, a furlong above.  A driveway led twistingly down from the gate-lodge, to the house. Along  this drive, was pacing a dog.    As the girl caught sight of him, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#8)"],[1,"grily.  \"Think I was frightened by a  thing like that?\"    \"You'll do; you'll do,\" said the dealer, with a little chuckle.  \"Now  then; it was half my fault, and half yours.\"    The next moment Mark was in his seat, holding his mount with a tight  hand as it began to paw up the sand, eager to start.    \"Wait for me,\" cried Dean, for the dealer was clapping the halter on  another of the ponies, whose back Dean reached without mishap; and then  as if thoroughly accustomed to run together, the attractive looking  little pair moved off at an easy canter, closely followed by the other  two, and going soon after at a quiet hand gallop twice round the large  kraal, and stopping short close up to the dealer at the end of their  career.    The boys jumped down, and the two unmounted ponies waited patiently  while the halters were shifted and the performance repeated.    \"Well, gentlemen, are you satisfied?\" said the man, patting the ponies'  necks as he spoke.    \"Yes, quite,\" said Sir James.  \"What do you say, doctor?\"    \"I should say more than satisfied, only I am afraid that they won't be  up to our weight.\"    \"Don't you make any mistake, sir.  These little fellows can do more than  you expect--that is, if you treat them well.  You won't ride them till  they founder, I'll be bound.  Just you take care that they have enough,  and you will find that they will do all you want.  You would like me to  keep them till you start, I suppose?\"    \"Certainly,\" said the doctor; and soon after the little party returned  to their inn, the boys talking eagerly about their new acquaintance.    \"But I say, father,\" said Mark, \"why, what a party we are going to be--  five men, our four selves, four ponies, and all those oxen.  Let's see;  that's all, isn't it?\"    \"No,\" said Sir.  James; \"you forget the guide.\"    \"Black, isn't he, uncle?\"    \"Yes; I suppose he's a regular Kaffir, a sort of Zulu.  What did the  captain say he was, doctor?\"    \"An Illaka, he called him, I believe, something of the same sort of  black, as the Matabeles.  But you have forgotten two more.\"    \"Two more, sir?\" said Dean.  \"No, we have counted them all.\"    \"What about the two black forelopers?\"    \"Why, what are they?\" cried Mark.    \"The two blacks who go in front of the foremost bullocks.\"    \"Oh,\" said Mark.  \"I say, we are beginning to grow.\"    \"Yes,\" said Sir James; \"we are getting to be a pretty good hunting  party.  What with ourselves, men and cattle, we shall have a good many  mouths to feed.\"    \"But you don't want to go back, father?\"    \"I did, thoroughly,\" replied Sir James, \"when we were down at that  dreadful port.\"    \"But not now, uncle,\" cried Dean.    \"Certainly not, my boy.  I am as eager to go forward as you boys, and I  believe the doctor too.  I think we are going to have a most delightful  trip.  But I say, this doesn't look to me a very good specimen of the  health of the country;\" and he nodded his head in the direction of a  very tall, extremely thin, bilious-looking individual who passed them,  and whom they saw make his way right up to the dealer's house.    \"Talk about moustachios,\" cried Mark.  \"Why, they look like those of a  china figure in a tea-shop.  I wonder what he calls himself.\"    \"And this one too,\" said Dean, for they met a fine-looking, well built  black with well-cut features, nose almost aquiline, and a haughty look  of disdain in his frowning eyes, as, spear over shoulder, he stalked by  the English party, not even deigning to turn to glance back.    \"I should think he's a chief,\" said Mark; \"a sort of king in his way.\"    \"Doesn't cost him much a year for his clothes,\" said Dean, laughing, for  the big fellow's costume was the simplest of the simple.    \"Ah, not much,\" said Sir James, looking after the man; \"one of Nature's  noblemen, who looks as if he had never done a stroke of work in his  life.  I wonder whether he would ever dare to make use of that spear.\"    \"I don't think there's any doubt about it, sir,\" said the doctor, \"if he  were offended; and if we meet men like that we shall have to be friends,  for that's an ugly looking weapon that he carries over his shoulder with  such a jaunty air.\"    \"What are you thinking about, doctor?\"    \"I was thinking about the full-blooded black that the captain yonder  promised to get us for our guide, and I was wondering whether that was  likely to be he.\"    The doctor's words made the rest turn to gaze after the fine-looking,  lithe and active black, who stalked on, haughty of mien, without even  seeming to give a thought to the English intruders upon his soil.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    `MAK' IS SENT IN.    The barracks of Illakaree did not form an attractive object in the  lovely landscape surrounded by hills, in and out amongst which the  Reptile River ran, for a building hastily raised of corrugated iron  never was and never will be beautiful.    \"I say ugly,\" said Mark to his cousin, \"but all the same I should like  to be inside one when there was a bad hailstorm.  My word, what a shindy  there would be with the big stones--lumps of ice, I suppose, they would  be in a place like this--hammering down upon the zinc roof.\"    \"The soldiers look cheery enough.\"    \"And healthy,\" said the doctor.    \"Thoroughly,\" said Sir James.  \"It is a pity they cannot make  arrangements down at the port to give their men a holiday up here.\"    They were close up to the captain's quarters, and he, catching sight of  the party, came out hastily to shake hands.    \"Well,\" he said, in a light cheery way, \"what can I do for you?  How are  you getting on?\"    \"Excellently,\" said the doctor, \"thanks to you.  We have secured the  ponies, two waggons, and two span of oxen with their drivers.\"    \"That's right.  Have you got your forelopers too.\"    \"Not yet, but I suppose there will be no difficulty about them.\"    \"Not the slightest.  We generally have one or two black fellows eager to  get a job with someone going up country.  I will undertake to find them.  The oxen are all right, for I have seen them.  You couldn't have had a  better lot, and you are quite right too over the ponies.  Now, is there  anything else I can do?\"    Before the doctor could speak, the frank, good looking young captain  turned to the boys.    \"Nice lucky pair of young dogs you are--going on a natural history and  hunting trip like this!  What wouldn't I give to come with you!\"    \"Well, come, then,\" said Sir James.  \"I should be delighted to  strengthen our party with such a companion.  You know a good deal about  the country, don't you?\"    \"Well--yes.  I have had two or three little excursions in the direction  you are going through the great forests and away on to where the old  stones are said to be, Dr Robertson,\" continued the speaker, turning to  that visitor.    \"But I understood you to say that you had never seen them.\"    \"No; I had to turn back, for my leave had nearly expired, and I came  away with the belief that there were no ruins, and that those who had  reported about them had seen nothing but some of the castle-like kopjes  that look sometimes at a distance like built fortresses of huge granite  stones.  Still I have heard on the other hand that there are such ruins,  and that after their fashion the black tribes keep it a secret and look  upon the spot as a sort of Mecca--a sacred place which it is dangerous  to approach and which they will not allow the white man to come near for  fear he should be hurt, and from fear on their own part of the old  bogeys which haunt the ruins.  I don't answer for this.  It may be all  talk, and if I had time there is nothing I should like to do better than  to prove it.\"    \"Then you think there is risk in going there.\"    \"No,\" said the captain, \"I really do not.  If there were I don't think  that the guide would be so ready to undertake his task.\"    \"But the ruins may exist,\" said the doctor; and the boys listened with  their ears wide open or well on the gape for news.    \"Certainly; there is plenty of room,\" said the captain, laughing; \"and  the black fellow I told you about, as far as I can make out from his  jumble of the Ulaka language and broken English, declares that he has  seen them--big stone kraals, he calls them.\"    \"Well, why can't you come with us to see?\" said the doctor.  \"It is  bound to be very interesting.\"    \"Awfully,\" said the captain, \"and there must be plenty of good sport out  there.  I'll vouch for that.\"    \"What shall we get?\" asked Mark eagerly.    \"Lions,\" said the captain, smiling--\"plenty of them.  Do you like lion  shooting?\"    \"How can I?\" said Mark testily.  \"How could I?  I never shot anything  bigger than a pheasant in my life.  You are laughing at me.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said the captain, patting him on the shoulder; \"and I daresay  next time we meet you will have bagged one or more, and have the skins  to show me.  Then you will get leopards, which by all means shoot, for  they are very mischievous.  You will find plenty of hippos in the river,  and crocs too.  That's why they call it Reptile River; and if you go on  far enough, as you ought to if you have plenty of time, you may get a  shot or two at giraffes.  Ah, and as I say if you go on far enough you  may run against okapis.\"    \"O--what, sir?\" cried the boys eagerly.    \"Oh, a curious new animal that they are reporting.  They say it looks  half way between a giraffe and a zebra, and it's found in the great  central forests.  Ah, boys, you have got a fine time before you, and as  I said before, I envy you both.\"    \"Then why not think better of Sir James's invitation?\" said the doctor.  \"I am sure you would be able to assist us wonderfully.  Say you will  come.\"    \"Can't,\" said the captain firmly.  \"Duty.  The people about here are  very peaceable now, but they may break out at any time; and suppose  there was an _emeute_ amongst these blacks while I was away shooting.  I  thank you, Sir James, most heartily, but it is impossible.  You will  have a"]]]
