Its antidote for all ills is God, the perfect Mind, which  corrects mortal thought, whence cometh all evil. God  can and does destroy the thought that leads to moral [20]  or physical death. Intemperance, impurity, sin of every  sort, is destroyed by Truth. The appetite for alcohol  yields to Science as directly and surely as do sickness  and sin.    _Does Mrs. Eddy take patients?_ [25]    She now does not. Her time is wholly devoted to in-  struction, leaving to her students the work of healing;  which, at this hour, is in reality the least difficult of the  labor that Christian Science demands.    [Page 38.]    _Why do you charge for teaching Christian Science, when_ [1]  _all the good we can do must be done freely?_    When teaching imparts the ability to gain and main-  tain health, to heal and elevate man in every line of  life,--as this teaching certainly does,--is it un- [5]  reasonable to expect in return something to support  one's self and a Cause? If so, our whole system  of education, secular and religious, is at fault, and the  instructors and philanthropists in our land should ex-  pect no compensation. \"If we have sown unto you [10]  spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your  carnal things?\"    _How happened you to establish a college to instruct in_  _metaphysics, when other institutions find little interest in_  _such a dry and abstract subject?_ [15]    Metaphysics, as taught by me at the Massachusetts  Metaphysical College, is far from dry and abstract. It  is a Science that has the animus of Truth. Its practical  application to benefit the race, heal the sick, enlighten  and reform the sinner, makes divine metaphysics need- [20]  ful, indispensable. Teaching metaphysics at other col-  leges means, mainly, elaborating a man-made theory,  or some speculative view too vapory and hypothetical  for questions of practical import.    _Is it necessary to study your Science in order to be healed_ [25]  _by it and keep well?_    It is not necessary to make each patient a student  in order to cure his present disease, if this is what  you mean. Were it so, the Science would be of less    [Page 39.]    practical value. Many who apply for help are not [1]  prepared to take a course of instruction in Christian  Science.    To avoid being _subject_ to disease, would require the  understanding of how you are healed. In 1885, this [5]  knowledge can be obtained in its genuineness at the  Massachusetts Metaphysical College. There are abroad  at this early date some grossly incorrect and false  teachers of what they term Christian Science; of such  beware. They have risen up in a day to make this claim; [10]  whereas the Founder of genuine Christian Science has  been all her years in giving it birth.    _Can you take care of yourself?_    God giveth to every one this _puissance_; and I have  faith in His promise, \"Lo, I am with you alway\"-- [15]  _all the way_. Unlike the M. D.'s, Christian Scientists  are not afraid to take their own medicine, for this  medicine is divine Mind; and from this saving, ex-  haustless source they intend to fill the human mind with  enough of the leaven of Truth to leaven the whole lump. [20]  There may be exceptional cases, where one Christian  Scientist who has more to meet than others needs support  at times; then, it is right to bear \"one another's burdens,  and so fulfil the law of Christ.\"    _In what way is a Christian Scientist an instrument by_ [25]  _which God reaches others to heal them, and what most_  _obstructs the way?_    A Christian, or a Christian Scientist, assumes no more  when claiming to work with God in healing the sick,  than in converting the sinner. Divine help is as neces-    [Page 40.]    sary in the one case as in the other. The scientific Prin- [1]  ciple of healing demands such cooperation; but this  unison and its power would be arrested if one were to  mix material methods with the spiritual,--were to min-  gle hygienic rules, drugs, and prayers in the same pro- [5]  cess,--and thus serve \"other gods.\" Truth is as  effectual in destroying sickness as in the destruction  of sin.    It is often asked, \"If Christian Science is the same  method of healing that Jesus and the apostles used, [10]  why do not its students perform as instantaneous cures  as did those in the first century of the Christian era?\"    In some instances the students of Christian Science  equal the ancient prophets as healers. All true healing  is governed by, and demonstrated on, the same Princi- [15]  ple as theirs; namely, the action of the divine Spirit,  through the power of Truth to destroy error, discord  of whatever sort. The reason that the same results fol-  low not in every ease, is that the student does not in  every case possess sufficiently the Christ-spirit and its [20]  power to cast out the disease. The Founder of Chris-  tian Science teaches her students that they must possess  the spirit of Truth and Love, must gain the power  over sin in themselves, or they cannot be instantaneous  healers. [25]    In this Christian warfare the student or practitioner  has to master those elements of evil too common to other  minds. If it is hate that is holding the purpose to kill  his patient by mental means, it requires more divine  understanding to conquer this sin than to nullify either [30]  the disease itself or the ignorance by which one unin-  tentionally harms himself or another. An element of    [Page 41.]    brute-force that only the cruel and evil can send forth, is [1]  given vent in the diabolical practice of one who, having  learned the power of liberated thought to do good, per-  verts it, and uses it to accomplish an evil purpose. This  mental malpractice would disgrace Mind-healing, were it [5]  not that God overrules it, and causes \"the wrath of man\"  to praise Him. It deprives those who practise it of the  power to heal, and destroys their own possibility of  progressing.    The honest student of Christian Science is purged [10]  through Christ, Truth, and thus is ready for victory in  the ennobling strife. The good fight must be fought by  those who keep the faith and finish their course. Mental  purgation must go on: it promotes spiritual growth,  scales the mountain of human endeavor, and gains the [15]  summit in Science that otherwise could not be reached,  --where the struggle with sin is forever done.    _Can all classes of disease be healed by your method?_    We answer, Yes. Mind is the architect that builds  its own idea, and produces all harmony that appears. [20]  There is no other healer in the case. If mortal mind,  through the action of fear, manifests inflammation and a  belief of chronic or acute disease, by removing the cause  in that so-called mind the effect or disease will disappear  and health will be restored; for health, _alias_ harmony, [25]  is the normal manifestation of man in Science. The  divine Principle which governs the universe, including  man, if demonstrated, is sufficient for all emergencies.  But the practitioner may not always prove equal to  bringing out the result of the Principle that he knows to [30]  be true.    [Page 42.]    _After the change called death takes place, do we meet_ [1]  _those gone before?--or does life continue in thought only_  _as in a dream?_    Man is not annihilated, nor does he lose his identity,  by passing through the belief called death. After the [5]  momentary belief of dying passes from mortal mind, this  mind is still in a conscious state of existence; and the in-  dividual has but passed through a moment of extreme  mortal fear, to awaken with thoughts, and being, as  material as before. Science and Health clearly states [10]  that spiritualization of thought is not attained by the death  of the body, but by a conscious union with God. When  we shall have passed the ordeal called death, or destroyed  this last enemy, and shall have come upon the same plane  of conscious existence with those gone before, then we [15]  shall be able to communicate with and to recognize them.    If, before the change whereby we meet the dear de-  parted, our life-work proves to have been well done, we  shall not have to repeat it; but our joys and means of ad-  vancing will be proportionately increased. [20]    The difference between a belief of material existence  and the spiritual fact of Life is, that the former is a dream  and unreal, while the latter is real and eternal. Only  as we understand God, and learn that good, not evil,  lives and is immortal, that immortality exists only in [25]  spiritual perfection, shall we drop our false sense of Life  in sin or sense material, and recognize a better state of  existence.    _Can I be treated without being present during treatment?_    Mind is not confined to limits; and nothing but our [30]  own false admissions prevent us from demonstrating this    [Page 43.]    great fact. Christian Science, recognizing the capabili- [1]  ties of Mind to act of itself, and independent of matter,  enables one to heal cases without even having seen the  individual,--or simply after having been made ac-  quainted with the mental condition of the patient. [5]    _Do all who at present claim to be teaching Christian_  _Science, teach it correctly?_    By no means: Christian Science is not sufficiently un-  derstood for that. The student of this Science who under-  stands it best, is the one least likely to pour into other [10]  minds a trifling sense of it as being adequate to make safe  and successful practitioners. The simple sense one gains  of this Science through careful, unbiased, contemplative  reading of my books, is far more advantageous to the  sick and to the learner than is or can be the spurious [15]  teaching of those who are spiritually unqualified. The  sad fact at this early writing is, that the letter is gained  sooner than the spirit of Christian Science: time is re-  quired thoroughly to qualify students for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#8)"],[1,"and admirable discoverie of the  three Witches of Warboys, arraigned, convicted and executed at the last  assizes at Huntingdon...._ (London, 1593).

The case mentioned in _Cal. St. P.,  Dom., 1581-1590_, 29, was probably a result of the activity of the privy  council. The case in _id._, _Add., 1580-1625_, 120-121, is an instance  of where the accused was suspected of both witchcraft and \"high treason  touching the supremacy.\" Nearly all of the above mentioned references to  the activity of the privy council refer to the first half of the reign  and a goodly proportion to the years 1578-1582.

[45] An aged widow had been committed to gaol on the testimony of her  neighbors that she was \"lewde, malitious, and hurtful to the people.\" An  ostler, after he had refused to give her relief, had suffered a pain. So  far as the account goes, this was the sum of the evidence against the  woman. Unhappily she waited not on the order of her trial but made  voluble confession and implicated five others, three of whom were  without doubt professional enchanters. She had met, she said, with  Mother Dutten, Mother Devell, and Mother Margaret, and \"concluded  several hainous and vilanous practices.\" The deaths of five persons whom  she named were the outcome of their concerted plans. For the death of a  sixth she avowed entire responsibility. This amazing confession may have  been suggested to her piece by piece, but it was received at full value.  That she included others in her guilt was perhaps because she responded  to the evident interest aroused by such additions, or more likely  because she had grudges unsatisfied. The women were friendless, three of  the four were partially dependent upon alms, there was no one to come to  their help, and they were convicted. The man that had been arraigned, a  \"charmer,\" seems to have gone free.    [46] _Injunctions ... of ... Bishop of Durham_, 18, 84, 99; Visitations  of Canterbury, in _Arch.

Instance where the Bishop of  London seems to have examined a case and turned it over to the privy  council.    [55] Rachel Pinder and Agnes Bridges, who pretended to be possessed by  the Devil, were examined before the \"person of St. Margarets in  Lothberry,\" and the Mayor of London, as well as some justices of the  peace. They later made confession before the Archbishop of Canterbury  and some justices of the peace. See the black letter pamphlet, _The  discloysing of a late counterfeyted possession by the devyl in two  maydens within the Citie of London_ [1574].    [56] Francis Coxe came before the queen rather than the church. He  narrates his experiences in _A short treatise declaringe the detestable  wickednesse of magicall sciences, ..._ (1561). Yet John Walsh, a man  with a similar record, came before the commissary of the Bishop of  Exeter. See _The Examination of John Walsh before Master Thomas  Williams, Commissary to the Reverend father in God, William, bishop of  Excester, upon certayne Interrogatories touchyng Wytch-crafte and  Sorcerye, in the presence of divers gentlemen and others, the XX of  August, 1566_.    [57] We say \"practically,\" because instances of church jurisdiction come  to light now and again throughout the seventeenth century.          CHAPTER II.    WITCHCRAFT UNDER ELIZABETH.      The year 1566 is hardly less interesting in the history of English  witchcraft than 1563. It has been seen that the new statute passed in  1563 was the beginning of a vigorous prosecution by the state of the  detested agents of the evil one. In 1566 occurred the first important  trial known to us in the new period. That trial deserves note not only  on its own account, but because it was recorded in the first of the long  series of witch chap-books--if we may so call them. A very large  proportion of our information about the execution of the witches is  derived from these crude pamphlets, briefly recounting the trials. The  witch chap-book was a distinct species. In the days when the chronicles  were the only newspapers it was what is now the \"extra,\" brought out to  catch the public before the sensation had lost its flavor. It was of  course a partisan document, usually a vindication of the worthy judge  who had condemned the guilty, with some moral and religious  considerations by the respectable and righteous author. A terribly  serious bit of history it was that he had to tell and he told it grimly  and without pity. Such comedy as lights up the gloomy black-letter pages  was quite unintentional. He told a story too that was full of details  trivial enough in themselves, but details that give many glimpses into  the every-day life of the lower classes in town and country.    The pamphlet of 1566 was brief and compact of information. It was  entitled _The examination and confession of certaine Wytches at  Chensforde in the Countie of Essex before the Quenes Maiesties Judges  the XXVI daye of July anno 1566_. The trial there recorded is one that  presents some of the most curious and inexplicable features in the  annals of English witchcraft. The personnel of the \"size\" court is  mysterious. At the first examination \"Doctor Cole\" and \"Master Foscue\"  were present. Both men are easily identified. Doctor Cole was the  Reverend Thomas Cole, who had held several places in Essex and had in  1564 been presented to the rectory of Stanford Rivers, about ten miles  from Chelmsford. Master Foscue was unquestionably Sir John Fortescue,  later Chancellor of the Exchequer, and at this time keeper of the great  wardrobe. On the second examination Sir Gilbert Gerard, the queen's  attorney, and John Southcote, justice of the queen's bench, were  present. Why Southcote should be present is perfectly clear. It is not  so easy to understand about the others. Was the attorney-general acting  as presiding officer, or was he conducting the prosecution? The latter  hypothesis is of course more consistent with his position. But what were  the rector of Stanford Rivers and the keeper of the great wardrobe doing  there? Had Doctor Cole been appointed in recognition of the claims of  the church? And the keeper of the wardrobe, what was the part that he  played? One cannot easily escape the conclusion that the case was deemed  one of unusual significance. Perhaps the privy council had heard of  something that alarmed it and had delegated these four men, all known  at Elizabeth's court, to examine into the matter in connection with the  assizes.    The examinations themselves present features of more interest to the  psychologist than to the historical student. Yet they have some  importance in the understanding of witchcraft as a social phenomenon.  Elizabeth Francis, when examined, confessed with readiness to various  \"vilanies.\" From her grandmother she said she had as a child received a  white spotted cat, named Sathan, whom she had fed, and who gave her what  she asked for. \"She desired to have one Andrew Byles to her husband,  which was a man of some welth, and the cat dyd promyse she shold.\" But  the promise proved illusory. The man left her without marriage and then  she \"willed Sathan ... to touch his body, whych he forthewith dyd,  whereof he died.\" Once again she importuned Satan for a husband. This  time she gained one \"not so rich as the other.\" She bore a daughter to  him, but the marriage was an unhappy one. \"They lived not so quietly as  she desyred, beinge stirred to much unquietnes and moved to swearing and  cursinge.\" Thereupon she employed the spirit to kill her child and to  lame her husband. After keeping the cat fifteen years she turned it over  to Mother Waterhouse, \"a pore woman.\"[1]    Mother Waterhouse was now examined. She had received the cat and kept it  \"a great while"]]]
