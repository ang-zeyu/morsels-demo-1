A hundred persons might be named, and  the list would include some of the greatest benefactors of their race,  who never think of sleeping more than _six_ hours a day. And yet many  of you are scarcely contented with eight!    Would you conquer as Bonaparte did--not states, provinces, and  empires,--but would you aspire to the high honor of conquering  yourselves, and of extending your conquests intellectually and morally,  you must take the necessary steps. The path is a plain one; requiring  nothing but a little moral courage. 'What man has done, man may do.' I  know you do not and ought not to aspire to conquer kingdoms, or to  become prime ministers; but you ought to aspire to get the victory over  yourselves:--a victory as much more noble than those of Napoleon, and  Caesar, and Alexander, as intellectual and moral influence are superior  to mere brute force.          [2] Dr. Franklin, in view of the latter fact, wrote a humorous        Essay, at Paris, in which he labored hard to show the people of        that luxurious and dissipated city, that the sun gives light as        soon as it rises.      SECTION VII. _On Duty to Parents._    It was the opinion of a very eminent and observing man, that those who  are obedient to parents, are more healthy, long lived, and happy than  those who are disobedient. And he reasons very fairly on the subject.    Now I do not know whether the promise annexed to the fifth command,  (whatever might have been intended, as addressed to the Jews,) has any  special reference to happiness in this life. I only know that in  general, those who are obedient to parents are apt to be virtuous in  other respects; for the virtues as well as the vices usually go in  companies. But that virtue in general tends to long life and happiness,  nobody will entertain a doubt.    I am sorry, however, to find that the young, when they approach adult  years, are apt to regard authority as irksome. It should not be so. So  long as they remain under the parental roof, they ought to feel it a  pleasure to conform to the wishes of the parents in all the  arraignments of the family, if not absolutely unreasonable. And even in  the latter case, it is my own opinion--and one which has not been  hastily formed, either--that it would be better to submit, with  cheerfulness; and for three reasons.    1st. For the sake of your own reputation; which will always be  _endangered_ by disobedience, however unjust the parental claim may be.    2d. From a love of your parents, and a sense of what you owe them for  their kind care; together with a conviction that perfect rectitude is  not to be expected. You will find error, more or less, every where  around you--even in yourselves; why should you expect perfection in  your parents?    3d. Because it is better to _suffer_ wrong than to _do_ wrong. Perhaps  there is nothing which so improves human character, as suffering  wrongfully; although the world may be slow to admit the principle. More  than this; God himself has said a great deal about _obedience to  parents_.    If real evils multiply so that a young man finds he cannot remain in  his father's house, without suffering not only in his feelings, but  permanently in his temper and disposition, I will not say that it is  never best to leave it. I do not believe, however, there is _often_ any  such necessity. Of those who leave their paternal home on this plea, I  believe nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand might profitably  remain, if they would; and that a very large number would find the  fault in themselves--in their own temper, disposition or mistaken  views--rather than in their parents.    And what is to be _gained_ by going away? Unfortunately this is a  question too seldom asked by restless, or headstrong youths; and when  asked and answered, it is usually found that their unhappy experience  proves the answer to have been incorrect. I have seldom known a youth  turn out well who left his parents or his guardian or master. On this  subject, Franklin, I know, is often triumphantly referred to; but for  one such instance as that, I hazard nothing in saying there are  hundreds of a contrary character. Within the circle of my own  observation, young men who leave in this manner, have wished themselves  back again a thousand times.    But be this as it may, so long as you remain in the family, if you are  70 years of age, by all means yield to authority implicitly, and if  possible, cheerfully. Avoid, at least, altercation and reproaches. If  things do not go well, fix your eye upon some great example of  suffering wrongfully, and endeavor to profit by it.    There is no sight more attractive than that of a well ordered family;  one in which every child, whether five years old or fifty, submits  cheerfully to those rules and regulations which parental authority has  thought fit to impose. It is, to use a strong expression, an image of  heaven. But, exactly in the same proportion, a family of the contrary  character resembles the regions below.    Nor is this all. It is an ancient maxim,--and however despised by some  of the moderns, none can be more true,--that he only is fit to command  who has first learned to obey. Obedience, is, in fact, the great lesson  of human life. We first learn to yield our will to the dictates of  parental love and wisdom. Through them we learn to yield submissively  to the great laws of the Creator, as established in the material world.  We learn to avoid, if possible, the flame, the hail, the severity of  the cold, the lightning, the tornado, and the earthquake; and we do not  choose to fall from a precipice, to have a heavy body fall on us, to  receive vitriol or arsenic into our stomachs, (at least in health) or  to remain a very long time, immersed in water, or buried in the earth.  We submit also to the government under which we live. All these are  lessons of obedience. But the Christian goes farther; and it is his  purpose to obey not only all these laws, but any additional ones he may  find imposed, whether they pertain to material or immaterial  existences.    In short, he who would put himself in the most easy position, in the  sphere allotted him by the Author of Nature, must learn _to  obey_,--often implicitly and unconditionally. At least he must know how  to obey: and the earlier this knowledge is acquired, and corresponding  habits established, the better and happier will he find his condition,  and the more quiet his conscience.      SECTION VIII. _Faithfulness._    Hardly any thing pleases me more in a young man, than faithfulness to  those for whom he is employed, whether parents, guardians, masters, or  others.    There appears to be a strange misapprehension, in the minds of many, in  regard to this point. There are few who will not admit, in theory,  whatever may be their practice, that they ought to be faithful to their  parents. And by far the majority of the young doubtless perceive the  propriety of being faithful to their masters; so long at least, as they  are present. I will even go farther and admit that the number of young  men--sons, wards, apprentices, and servants--who would willingly be so  far unfaithful as to do any thing positively wrong because those who  are set over them happen to be absent, is by no means considerable.    But by faithfulness to our employers, I mean something more than the  mere doing of things because we are _obliged_ to do them, or because we  _must_. I wish to see young men feel an interest in the well being and  success of their employers; and take as good care of their concerns and  property, whether they are present or absent, as if they were their  own. The youth who would be more industrious, persevering, prudent,  economical, and attentive in business, if the profits were his own,  than he now is, does not in my opinion come up to the mark at which he  should aim.    The great apology for what I call unfaithfulness to employers, is,  'What shall I get by it?' that is, by being faithful. I have seen many  a young man who would labor at the employment regularly assigned him,  during a certain number of hours, or till a certain job was completed,  after which he seemed unwilling to lift a finger, except for his own  amusement, gratification, or emolument. A few minutes' labor might  repair a breach in a wall or corn crib, and save the owner many  dollars' worth of property, but it is passed by! By putting a few  deranged parcels of goods in their proper place, or writing down some  small item of account, which would save his employer much loss of time  or money, or both, a faithful clerk might often do a great service.  Would he not do it, if the loss was to be his own? Why not then do it  for his employer?    Those who neglect things, or perform them lazily or carelessly, because  they imagine they shall get nothing for it, would do well to read the  following story of a devoted and faithful domestic; which I suppose to  be a fact. It needs no comment.    A Mahratta Prince, in passing through a certain apartment, one day,  discovered one of his servants asleep with his master's slippers  clasped so tightly to his breast, that he was unable to disengage them.  Struck with the fact, and concluding at once, that a person who was so  jealously careful of a trifle, could not fail to be faithful when  entrusted with a thing of more importance, he appointed him a member of  his body-guards. The result proved that the prince was not mistaken.  Rising in office, step by step, the young man soon became the most  distinguished military commander in Mahratta; and his fame ultimately  spread through all India.      SECTION IX. _On Forming Temperate Habits._    'Be temperate in all things,' is an excellent rule, and of very high  authority.    _Drunkenness_ and _Gluttony_ are vices so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23875"],[0,"The Relief of Mafeking (#8)"],[1," If we were correspondents, heads were shaken, and  smooth-spoken people with stars and crowns on their shoulder-straps said  they doubted very much whether Lord Roberts would grant any more passes.  If we were nobodies who had come out (with more or less direct  encouragement from the officials) in the hope of getting commissions, we  were turned away like tramps, and told that there was \"nothing for us.\"  It was all rather flattening and dispiriting.    When we turned up again at headquarters next morning we found the place  empty but for a Kaffir charwoman snuffling over her brushes: Lord  Roberts gone, Lord Kitchener gone, all the staff gone, stolen away like  thieves in the night, gone \"to the front.\" No one was left in authority,  no one knew anything about us; so we went to the barracks and worried  irresponsible officers who would have moved heaven and earth for us if  they could, but they \"had no instructions.\" At last, in a remote corner  of the barrack buildings, someone discovered a major who was in charge  of the Intelligence Department. Didn't we all fall upon him like birds  of prey! In half an hour the telegraph that connected Cape Town with the  Commander-in-Chief was thrilling all our wants northward; in six hours  half the special service men were flying about the town collecting  sardines and whisky and ink; in twenty-four hours only a few of us were  left, still worrying the unfortunate major. Then the wires began to come  back from Lord Roberts saying that no licence must be granted to this  man and that; that there were more than enough correspondents at the  front; and at this news some of us began to quake. At this critical  point, when I was wandering in the corridor of the post office, I found  the Press Censor, all alone and unguarded; so I fastened upon him and  drove him, the kindest and most amiable of men, into his office, and  stood over him while he wrote a long telegram to the chief, in which  many reasons were given why I should go to the front. The result was  that I received the desired privilege, but when I left Cape Town many  men were still haunting the barracks and the post office.    My week of waiting was a busy time, but in the intervals between  sitting down before staff officers, interviewing possible--and  impossible--servants, and trying horses, I contrived to see a little  of the Cape Town life in those martial days.    One seemed to be no nearer the war there than in London or Manchester.  Troops marched to the station and disappeared into the night; so they  did at home. There were hospitals there, filled with wounded men; none  so large or so full as Netley. There was a big camp there; not so big a  camp as Aldershot. And the place was full of officers, coming and going,  even as Southampton had been crowded with officers pausing on their way  to or from the war. Then there was at Cape Town something like a famine  of news; by far the latest and most trustworthy came from London. Things  that thrilled us out there and were cabled home in hot haste were found  to be stale news in England. As the storm blows over the cliff far out  to sea, but leaves the hamlet on the shore in absolute peace, so Cape  Town seemed to be sheltered by the big, dominating mountain from all the  home-going news, and to abide in peaceful ignorance while the  telegraph-rooms resounded to the talk of the needles.    I rather dreaded the hospitals, but they were magnificent. To see so  many men bearing pain bravely and cheerfully were privilege enough; but  to find men who had undergone the most dreadful tortures soberly begging  and hoping to be sent back to the front showed one what can be  accomplished by discipline and an ideal of conduct. Here is an example.  Two men lay side by side in the Wynberg hospital. One had five holes in  his body, made during a charge by as many bullets. He had nearly  recovered. The other had been shot while lying down, and the bullet had  passed along his back and touched the base of his spine, paralysing him  for ever. Both men were almost weeping; the first with joy because there  was a chance of his returning to the front, the second with grief  because he was powerless to help his comrades any more. I could cite a  hundred examples of the astounding spirit that such men displayed. I do  not think that we at home ever doubted their bravery on the field, but  the kind of endurance that is seldom bred but by long habit and early  training was to be found no less universally in these hospital beds. The  people of Cape Town had done well in the matter of hospitals, and fully  half the accommodation was provided by public subscription. But  Government hospitals were far from efficient in their equipment, as well  as far from sufficient in their accommodation. Many things that would be  regarded as necessaries in a pauper hospital at home had to be provided  at Cape Town for the Government hospitals by private bounty.    I walked over to the infantry camp at Sea Point one morning with Mr.  Rudyard Kipling. As we neared the camp we overtook a private carrying in  his hand a large pair of boots. Mr. Rudyard Kipling asked if we were on  the right road, and the man said--    \"Yes; are yer goin' there? Then yer can tike these boots. I 'av to  entrine at twelve o'clock, and I ain't goin' ter miss it fer no blessed  boots. 'Ere, tike 'old,\" he continued, thrusting the boots into Mr.  Kipling's hand, \"and give 'em to Private Dickson, B Company; and mind,  if yer cawn't find 'im, jest tike 'em back ter Williams, opposite the  White 'Orse.\"    Mr. Kipling promised faithfully, and gave a receipt, which he signed;  but the man did not notice the name.    \"My friend,\" said Mr. Kipling, \"you'll get your head chaffed off when  you get back to the guard-room.\"    \"What for?\" vainly asked the man, and departed, while we continued our  way towards the camp.    No sooner were we inside the railings than Mr. Kipling was accosted by a  military policeman.    \"What are you doing here? You must get out of here, you know, sharp!\"    \"I'm taking these boots to Private Dickson,\" said Mr. Kipling.    \"Well, you ought to take them to the guard tent, and not go wandering  about the camp like this. Out of it, now!\"    Now Mr. Kipling had a pass from the Commander-in-Chief to go wherever he  pleased in South Africa, and, besides that, he is Rudyard Kipling, whom  private soldiers call their brother and father; so the situation was  amusing.    Just then a police sergeant rode up and said, \"Please, sir, I lived ten  years with the man as you get your tobacco from in Brighton; anything I  can do for you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Kipling, \"I want this man taken away and killed!\"    The youth was much confused, but he had done his duty; so Private  Dickson had his boots, and great was the mirth and loud the cheering  about the tents of B Company.    This police protection of the camps was surprisingly close, but one  learned the reason when one had moved about for a little while among the  military authorities. For here, even in the heart of British territory,  the Boer spy was feared; he was thought to be the servant of an agency  hardly less invisible and powerful than the Open Eye of the Mormons; and  one was told that his machinations were as patent as his secrecy was  perfect. One morning a section of the railings surrounding picketed  horses would be found demolished; on another the whole milk supply of a  camp would be infected by some poisonous bacillus. It seems almost  incredible, but it is true that all such mishaps were attributed to Boer  treachery. In the popular imagination the Boer agent moved undiscovered  amid the daily life of Cape Town; at noon in the busy street; in the  club smoke-room; in the hotel dining-room--a woman this time, arrayed in  frocks from Paris, and keeping a table charmed by her conversation. And  yet the objects of this superstitious dread were allowed to have  qualities that made some of our officers dislike their business. An  English officer said to me one night:    \"One can't say it here without being misunderstood, but I love the  Boers, even though I am fighting them. My father was a colonist, and  these men were like brothers of his. I have been in houses here where I  knew there were guns stored for the enemy, and where the sons would  probably be fighting me in the field, and the people have almost cried  when I have been going away; neither of us talked about it, but each  knew what was in the other's mind. People say they're like animals, and  perhaps they are; at least they're like animals in this, that once you  make them distrust you, you'll never win their confidence again. And  they don't trust us.\"    That officer is well enough known, and universally admired as a smart  soldier; but not everyone who sees the keen soldier, anxious above all  things for his own country's success, realises with what conflicting  emotions he goes to the fight.    I was anxious to see a real live Boer, as I thought it quite improbable  that I should see one at the front; half the officers and men who had  been wounded had never seen one of the enemy. So, having heard that our  Boer prisoners--450 in number--had been landed from Her Majesty's ship  _Penelope_ and encamped at Simonstown, I went there to visit them.    From Cape Town the land stretches an arm southward to the Cape of Good  Hope and Bellows Rock, where it divides the Atlantic from the Indian  Ocean. The mainland runs about as far southward, so that the arm partly  encloses the waters of False Bay; and in the hollow of its elbow nestles  Simonstown. This is a cluster of white houses on the sea-beat foot of a  hill that sweeps upward to the giddy white clouds. All day long at that  season the hill is steeped in sunshine; all day long its lower slopes  reverberate to the assault of the rollers while the summit is folded in  the silence of the upper air. Close in-shore half a dozen cruisers were"]]]
