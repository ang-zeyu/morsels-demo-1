L. 9-1/2.              _Range._ Screech Owls are found throughout the            greater part of the Western Hemisphere. Our            eastern form occurs in the eastern United States            from Canada southward. The Florida race (_O. a.            floridanus_, Case 3, Fig. 19) is smaller and of a            darker gray than the northern bird. The 'red'            phase is rare.

This, the smallest of our 'horned' Owls, is also the commonest. It lives  near and sometimes in our homes even when they are situated in towns.  Its tremulous, wailing whistle (in no sense a 'screech') is therefore  one of our most characteristic twilight bird-notes. Mice and insects  form the greater part of the Screech Owl's fare. Four to six white eggs  are laid in a hollow tree, bird-box, or similar site in April.      GREAT HORNED OWL    _Bubo virginianus virginianus. Case 1, Fig. 16_              Largest of the 'horned' Owls. L. 22.              _Range._ Western Hemisphere in many forms; our            form is confined to the eastern United States. A            Permanent Resident.              Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, tolerably common            P.R. Cambridge, uncommon, autumn or winter. N.            Ohio, rare P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.    The Great Horned Owl retreats before the civilization that destroys the  forests in which it lives. In thinly settled regions its deep-toned,  monotone, _whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, whooo, whooo_ is still a characteristic  bird voice, but most of us hear it only when we camp in the wilderness.  The bird's fierce nature has won for it the name of \"tiger among birds.\"  Rabbits, skunks, game birds and smaller prey form its fare. The 2-3  white eggs are laid in an abandoned Hawk, Crow, or squirrel nest in  February; it is the first of our northern birds to nest.      SNOWY OWL    _Nyctea nyctea_              A large Owl with no 'ear' tufts and yellow eyes;            chiefly white with small brownish or blackish            markings. L. 25.              _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, migrating            southward irregularly in winter to the northern            United States.              Washington, casual W.V.

A rare winter visitant which is more often seen along the seashore.  Unlike most Owls it hunts by day, feeding chiefly on mice but also on  birds.      HAWK OWL    _Surnia ulula caparoch_              A medium-sized Owl with a whitish face and yellow            eyes and a _long, rounded_ tail; the head is            spotted, the back barred with whitish; the            underparts are barred with white and blackish. L.            15; T. 7-1/4.              _Range._ Northern North America, rarely visiting            the northern United States in winter.              Cambridge, very rare in late fall. N. Ohio, rare            W.V. SE. Minn., uncommon W.V., Oct.-Mch.    \"The Hawk Owl is strictly diurnal, as much so as any of the Hawks, and  like some of them often selects a tall shrub or dead-topped tree in a  comparatively open place for a perch, where it sits in the bright  sunlight watching for its prey\" (Fisher).      FLORIDA BURROWING OWL    _Speotyto cunicularia floridana_              A small, ground Owl, with nearly naked legs and            feet and no ear-tufts. The upperparts are grayish            brown marked with white; the throat is white, rest            of underparts barred with grayish brown and white.            L. 9.              _Range._ Southern Florida, chiefly in the            Kissimmee Prairie region.    This is a representative of our western Burrowing Owl, which, in some  way unknown to man, has established itself far from others of its kind  in central southern Florida, where it is locally common. It nests in a  hole in the ground, excavated by itself, and lays 5-7 white eggs in  March.          PARROTS, MACAWS, PAROQUETS, COCKATOOS. ORDER PSITTACI          PARROTS AND PAROQUETS. FAMILY PSITTACIDAE      CAROLINA PAROQUET    _Conuropsis carolinensis carolinensis_              A long-tailed, green Paroquet with a yellow head,            orange forehead and cheeks. L. 12-1/2.              _Range._ Formerly southeastern United States north            to Virginia, west to Nebraska and Texas; now            southern Florida where it is on the verge of            extinction, if not extinct.              Washington, extinct, known only from specimens            shot in Sept., 1865.    The Paroquet has paid the penalty of wearing bright plumes, of making a  desirable cage-bird, of being destructive to fruit, and of having little  fear of man. Once abundant and wide-spread, for nearly the past half a  century it has been restricted to Florida, where the species will soon  go out of existence, if it has not already done so. Its nesting habits  are unknown.          CUCKOOS, KINGFISHERS, ETC. ORDER COCCYGES          CUCKOOS, ANIS, ETC. FAMILY CUCULIDAE      YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO    _Coccyzus americanus americanus. Case 7, Fig. 1_              Broadly white-tipped tail-feathers, a partly            yellow bill, and largely reddish brown primaries            distinguish this species from its black-billed            cousin. L. 12-1/2, of which one-half is tail.              _Range._ Nests from northern Florida to Canada;            winters in tropical America, returning to the            United States in April.

Their  notes are not like those of the cuckoo clock, which exactly imitates the  voice of the European Cuckoo, but a series of _cuck-cuck-cucks_ and  _cow-cows_ repeated a varying number of times. The Cuckoo rarely makes  long flights but slips from one tree to another, seeking at once the  inner branches and avoiding an exposed perch. The nest, a platform of  sticks, thinly covered, is placed in low trees or bushes. The 3-5  greenish blue eggs are laid in May.      BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO    _Coccyzus erythrophthalmus. Case 7, Fig. 2_              A wholly black bill (note that in both our Cuckoos            it is slightly curved), wings without reddish            brown, and small, inconspicuous white tips to the            tail-feathers distinguish this species from the            preceding.              _Range._ A more northern species than the            Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Nests from Virginia (Georgia            in the mountains) to Quebec; winters in tropical            America, reaching the southern States in April.              Washington, rather rare S.R., May 5-Oct. 6.            Ossining, common S.R., May 3-Oct. 7. Cambridge,            common S.R., May 12-Sept. 20. N.

The day after penning the foregoing notes on the Yellow-billed Cuckoo, I  saw a Black-bill make a prolonged, dashing flight through the open,  alight on the limb of a dead, leafless tree, directly over a young girl  who was calling loudly to an active dog near her, and from this  conspicuous perch utter its low _coo-coo_ notes, both looking and  sounding more like a Dove than a conventional Cuckoo. So while we may  say that the Cuckoos are much alike in habits one must not accept  generalized statements too literally. There is much individuality among  birds, a fact that makes their study far more interesting than if all  were cast in the same mold.    The notes of this species are softer than those of the Yellow-bill, but  the difference between the calls of the two species must be learned from  the birds, not from books. The nest of the Black-bill is the more  compactly built of the two, and its eggs are of a deeper shade.          KINGFISHERS. FAMILY ALCEDINIDAE      BELTED KINGFISHER    _Ceryle alcyon. Case 3, Fig. 18; Case 5, Fig. 10_              The female resembles the male, but the sides and            the band across the breast are reddish brown. This            is our only Kingfisher. Crest, color, size,            habits, all distinguish him. L. 13.              _Range._ North America; winters from Illinois and            Virginia, southward; migrates north in early            April.

The Belted Kingfisher is a watchman of the waterways who sounds his loud  rattle when we trespass on his territory, a gallant fisherman, who, like  a Falcon 'waits on' with fluttering wing, and the moment his aim is  taken plunges headlong with a splash on some fish that has ventured too  near the surface.    The nest is made at the end of a burrow in a bank; 5-8 white eggs are  laid in May.          WOODPECKERS, WRYNECKS, ETC. ORDER PICI          WOODPECKERS.

Truly marvellous! But, really, it is time to  inquire more carefully as to what these stories do mean; we must cease  to ascribe our intelligence to animals, and learn that it is we that  often possess their instinct. A cat on a farm will wander many miles in  search of prey, and will therefore be well acquainted with the country  for many miles round. It is taken fifty miles away. Again it wanders,  and comes across a bit of country it knew before. What more natural than  that it should go to its old home? Carrier-pigeons are taught \"homing\"  by taking them gradually longer flights from home, so that they may  learn the look of the country. We cannot always discover that a dog  actually was acquainted with the route by which it wanders home; but it  is quite absurd to imagine, as most people at once do, that it was a  perfect stranger to the lay of the land. To find our way a second time  over ground we have once trod is scarcely intelligence; we can only call  it instinct, though the word does not in the least explain the process.  Two years ago I first visited Douglas, in the Isle of Man. I reached the  station at 11 p.m.; I was guided to a house a mile through the town. I  scarcely paid any attention to the route, yet next morning I found my  way by the same route to the station, walking with my head bent, deeply  thinking all the time about other things than the way. I have the  instinct of locality. Most people going into a dark room that they know  are by muscular sense guided exactly to the very spot they wish; so  people who have the instinct of locality may wander over a moor exactly  to the place they wish to reach without thinking of where they go. There  may be no mental exercise connected with this. I have known a lady of  great intelligence who would lose her way within half-a-mile of the  house she had lived in forty years. This feeling about place belongs to  that part of us that we have in common with the lower creatures. We need  not postulate that the animals ever show signs of possessing our  intelligence; they possess, in common with us, what is not intelligence,  but instinct.              A. J. MACKINTOSH.                [_Sept. 24, 1892._]    Will you allow me to record in the _Spectator_ \"another dog story\"? It  is one that testifies, for the thousandth time, to canine sagacity,  and, as we are still in the silly season, which has this year in  particular been so very prolific in human follies, it may be of special  interest to learn some clever doings on the part of beasts. Quite  recently a Westphalian squire travelled by rail from Luexen to Wesel, on  the Rhine, for the purpose of enjoying some hunting, and took with him  his favourite hound. The hunting party was to have started on a Sunday  morning at nine o'clock, but, to the squire's great disappointment, his  sporting dog could nowhere be discovered. Disconsolate, he arrived on  the following Monday afternoon at his house, and, to his great delight,  he was greeted there with exuberant joy by his dog. The latter, who had  never made the journey from Luexen to Wesel, had simply run home, thus  clearing a distance of eighty English miles through an unknown country.  Why the sporting dog should have declined to join the hunt is, perhaps,  a greater mystery than the fact of his returning home without any other  guidance than his sagacious instinct. Possibly he was a Sabbatarian, and  objected to imitate his master's wicked example. So, Sunday papers,  please copy!              EIN THIERFREUND.                [_Sept. 8, 1894._]    May I be allowed to offer to your readers yet another instance of the  faithfulness and sagacity of our friend the dog? The anecdote comes from  a distinguished naval officer, and is best given in his own words: \"This  is what happened to a spaniel of mine. It was given to our children as a  puppy about three or four months old, and we have had it about five or  six months, making it about ten months old. It was born about three  miles from here, at Hertford, and has never been anywhere but from one  home to the other. When the time came for breaking him in for shooting  purposes, I sent him to a keeper at Leighton-Buzzard, and, to insure a  safe arrival, sent the dog with my man-servant to the train here, and  thence to King's Cross. He walked with the dog to Euston Station, turned  him over to the guard of the 12.15 train and the animal duly arrived at  Leighton-Buzzard at 1.30, and was there met by the keeper and taken to  his home about three miles off. That was on the Friday. On the following  Tuesday, the dog having been with him three full days, he took him out  in the morning with his gun, and at eight o'clock on Wednesday morning  (that being the following day) the dog appeared here, rather dirty, and  looking as if he had travelled some distance, which he undoubtedly had.  There is no doubt that this puppy of ten months old was sent away,  certainly forty or fifty miles as the crow flies, and that he returned  here in a day. How he did it no one can say, but it is nevertheless a  fact. It would be interesting to know his route and to trace his  adventures.\" This anecdote is the more remarkable in consequence of the  extreme youth of the dog, and particularly as he belongs to a breed of  sporting dogs which are not generally considered to rank among the most  intelligent of the species.              F. H. SUCKLING.                [_Sept. 15, 1894._]    The \"True Story of a Dog,\" in the _Spectator_ of September 8th, may be  matched, possibly explained, by a similar occurrence. I had bought a  Spanish poodle pup of an Irishman who assured me, \"Indade, sir, an' the  dog knows all my childer do, only he can't talk.\" He shut doors, opened  those with thumb-latches, and rushed upstairs and waked his mistress at  words of command. One day we were starting to drive to our former home  in the city, six miles distant, but the dog was refused his usual place  in the carriage, and shut up in the house. When we arrived, to our  astonishment we found him waiting for us on the doorstep! We could not  conceive how he got there, but upon inquiry found that he had got out,  gone to the station, in some way entered the train, hid under a seat,  and on arrival in the city threaded his way a mile through the streets,  and was found quietly awaiting our arrival.              R. P. S.                [_May 3, 1884._]    How do we know that in inviting dogs to the use of words Sir John  Lubbock is _developing_ their intelligence? Are we sure that he is not  asking them to descend to a lower level than their own, in teaching them  to communicate with us through our proper forms of speech, unnecessary  to them? I can vouch for the truth of the following story. A young  keeper, living about twelve miles east of Winchester, on leaving his  situation gave away a fox-terrier, which had been his constant companion  for some months; he then took another place in the north of Hampshire,  near the borders of Berkshire, in a part of the country to which he had  never been. The new owner of the dog took her with him to a village in  Sussex; before she had been there long she disappeared, and after a  short time found her old master in the woods at his new home. As I have  said before, he had never been there before, neither had she. Rather  ungratefully, he again gave the dog away, this time to a man living some  way north of Berkshire; she came back to him in a few days, and, I am  happy to say, is now to be allowed to stay with the master of her  choice. Can such a nature need to be taught our clumsy language.              A. H. WILLIAMS.                [_Feb. 16, 1895._]    As I see that you have published some interesting anecdotes about dogs,  I send you the two following, which perhaps you may think worth  inserting.    In 1873 we came to live in England, after a residence upon the  Continent, bringing with us a Swiss terrier of doubtful breed but of  marked sagacity, called Tan. One day, shortly after reaching the new  home from Switzerland, the dog was lost under the following  circumstances:--We had driven to a station eight miles off--East  Harling--to meet a friend. As the friend got out of the railway carriage  the dog got in without being noticed and the train proceeded on its way.  At the next station--Eccles Road--the dog's barking attracted the  attention of the station-master, who opened the carriage door, and the  dog jumped out. The station-master and the dog were perfect strangers.  He and a porter tried to lock up the dog, but he flew viciously at any  one who attempted to touch him, although he was not above accepting  food. For the next three days his behaviour was decidedly methodical;  starting from the station in the morning, he came back dejected and  tired at night. At last, on the evening of the third day, he reached  home, some nine miles away, along roads which he had not before  travelled, a sorry object and decidedly the worse for wear; after some  food he slept for twenty-four hours straight off.    Anecdote number two. One day a handsome black, smooth-haired retriever  puppy was given to us, whom we named Neptune. The terrier Tan greatly  resented having this new companion thrust upon him, and became very  jealous of him. Being small, he was unable to tackle so large a dog, but  sagacity accomplished what strength could not. Tan disappeared for two  days. One evening, hearing a tremendous commotion in the yard, we  rushed out to find a huge dog of the St. Bernard species inflicting a  severe castigation upon poor Nep, Tan meanwhile looking on, complacently  wagging his tail. Both Tan and his companion then disappeared for two  more days, after which Tan reappeared alone, apparently in an equable  frame of mind, and satisfied that he had had his revenge. We never  discovered where the large dog came from. I can attest the truth of the  two stories.           "]]]
