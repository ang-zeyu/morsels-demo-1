In each case the  bird had probably heard the song and learned it while very young. In  the Trossachs, in Scotland, I followed a song thrush about for a long  time, attracted by its peculiar song. It repeated over and over again  three or four notes of a well-known air, which it might have caught  from some shepherd boy whistling to his flock or to his cow.    The songless birds--why has Nature denied them this gift? But they  nearly all have some musical call or impulse that serves them very  well. The quail has his whistle, the woodpecker his drum, the pewee  his plaintive cry, the chickadee his exquisitely sweet call, the  highhole his long, repeated \"wick, wick, wick,\" one of the most  welcome sounds of spring, the jay his musical gurgle, the hawk his  scream, the crow his sturdy caw. Only one of our pretty birds of the  orchard is reduced to an all but inaudible note, and that is the  cedar-bird.                                            III                           NATURE WITH CLOSED DOORS      December in our climate is the month when Nature finally shuts up  house and turns the key. She has been slowly packing up and putting  away her things and closing a door and a window here and there all the  fall. Now she completes the work and puts up the last bar. She is  ready for winter. The leaves are all off the trees, except that here  and there a beech or an oak or a hickory still clings to a remnant of  its withered foliage. Her streams are full, her new growths of wood  are ripened, her saps and juices are quiescent. The muskrat has  completed his house in the shallow pond or stream, the beaver in the  northern woods has completed his. The wild mice and the chipmunk have  laid up their winter stores of nuts and grains in their dens in the  ground and in the cavities of trees. The woodchuck is rolled up in his  burrow in the hillside, sleeping his long winter sleep. The coon has  deserted his chamber in the old tree and gone into winter quarters in  his den in the rocks. The winter birds have taken on a good coat of  fat against the coming cold and a possible scarcity of food. The  frogs and toads are all in their hibernaculums in the ground.    I saw it stated the other day, in a paper read before some scientific  body, that the wood frogs retreat two feet into the ground beyond the  reach of frost. In two instances I have found the wood frog in  December with a covering of less than two inches of leaves and moss.  It had buried itself in the soil and leaf mould only to the depth of  the thickness of its own body, and for covering had only the ordinary  coat of dry leaves and pine needles to be found in the wood. It was  evidently counting upon the snow for its main protection. In one case  I marked the spot, and returned there in early spring to see how the  frog had wintered. I found it all right. Evidently it had some charm  against the cold, for while the earth around and beneath it was yet  frozen solid, there was no frost in the frog. It was not a brisk frog,  but it was well, and when I came again on a warm day a week later, it  had come forth from its retreat and was headed for the near-by marsh,  where in April, with its kith and kin, it helped make the air vocal  with its love-calls. A friend of mine, one mild day late in December,  found a wood frog sitting upon the snow in the woods. She took it home  and put it to bed in the soil of one of her flower-pots in the cellar.  In the spring she found it in good condition, and in April carried it  back to the woods. The hyla, or little piping frog, passes the winter  in the ground like the wood frog. I have seen the toad go into the  ground in the late fall. It is an interesting proceeding. It literally  elbows its way into the soil. It sits on end, and works and presses  with the sharp joints of its folded legs until it has sunk itself at a  sufficient depth, which is only a few inches beneath the surface. The  water frogs appear to pass the winter in the mud at the bottom of  ponds and marshes. The queen bumblebee and the queen hornet, I think,  seek out their winter quarters in holes in the ground in September,  while the drones and the workers perish. The honey-bees do not  hibernate: they must have food all winter; but our native wild bees  are dormant during the cold months, and survive the winter only in the  person of the queen mother. In the spring these queens set up  housekeeping alone, and found new families.    Insects in all stages of their growth are creatures of the warmth; the  heat is the motive power that makes them go; when this fails, they are  still. The katydids rasp away in the fall as long as there is warmth  enough to keep them going; as the heat fails, they fail, till from the  emphatic \"Katy did it\" of August they dwindle to a hoarse, dying,  \"Kate, Kate,\" in October. Think of the stillness that falls upon the  myriad wood-borers in the dry trees and stumps in the forest as the  chill of autumn comes on. All summer have they worked incessantly in  oak and hickory and birch and chestnut and spruce, some of them  making a sound exactly like that of the old-fashioned hand augur,  others a fine, snapping, and splintering sound; but as the cold comes  on, they go slower and slower, till they finally cease to move. A warm  day starts them again, slowly or briskly according to the degree of  heat, but in December they are finally stilled for the season. These  creatures, like the big fat grubs of the June beetles which one  sometimes finds in the ground or in decayed wood, are full of frost in  winter; cut one of the big grubs in two, and it looks like a lump of  ice cream.    Some time in October the crows begin to collect together in large  flocks and establish their winter quarters. They choose some secluded  wood for a roosting-place, and thither all the crows for many square  miles of country betake themselves at night, and thence they disperse  in all directions again in the early morning. The crow is a social  bird, a true American; no hermit or recluse is he. The winter probably  brings them together in these large colonies for purposes of  sociability and for greater warmth. By roosting close together and  quite filling a tree-top, there must result some economy of heat.    I have seen it stated in a rhetorical flight of some writer that the  new buds crowd the old leaves off. But this is not true as a rule. The  new bud is formed in the axil of the old leaf long before the leaves  are ready to fall. With only two species of our trees known to me  might the swelling bud push off the old leaf. In the sumach and  button-ball or plane-tree the new bud is formed immediately under the  base of the old leaf-stalk, by which it is covered like a cap. Examine  the fallen leaves of these trees, and you will see the cavity in the  base of each where the new bud was cradled. Why the beech, the oak,  and the hickory cling to their old leaves is not clear. It may be  simply a slovenly trait--inability to finish and have done with a  thing--a fault of so many people. Some oaks and beeches appear to lack  decision of character. It requires strength and vitality, it seems,  simply to let go. Kill a tree suddenly, and the leaves wither upon the  branches. How neatly and thoroughly the maples, the ashes, the  birches, the elm clean up. They are tidy, energetic trees, and can  turn over a new leaf without hesitation.    A correspondent, writing to me from one of the colleges, suggests that  our spring really begins in December, because the \"annual cycle of  vegetable life\" seems to start then. At this time he finds that many  of our wild flowers--the bloodroot, hepatica, columbine, shinleaf,  maidenhair fern, etc.--have all made quite a start toward the next  season's growth, in some cases the new shoot being an inch high. But  the real start of the next season's vegetable life in this sense is  long before December. It is in late summer, when the new buds are  formed on the trees. Nature looks ahead, and makes ready for the new  season in the midst of the old. Cut open the terminal hickory buds in  the late fall and you will find the new growth of the coming season  all snugly packed away there, many times folded up and wrapped about  by protecting scales. The catkins of the birches, alders, and hazel  are fully formed, and as in the case of the buds, are like eggs to be  hatched by the warmth of spring. The present season is always the  mother of the next, and the inception takes place long before the sun  loses his power. The eggs that hold the coming crop of insect life are  mostly laid in the late summer or early fall, and an analogous start  is made in the vegetable world. The egg, the seed, the bud, are all  alike in many ways, and look to the future. Our earliest spring  flower, the skunk-cabbage, may be found with its round green  spear-point an inch or two above the mould in December. It is ready to  welcome and make the most of the first fitful March warmth. Look at  the elms, too, and see how they swarm with buds. In early April they  suggest a swarm of bees.    In all cases, before Nature closes her house in the fall, she makes  ready for its spring opening.                                            IV                               THE WIT OF A DUCK      The homing instinct in birds and animals is one of their most  remarkable traits: their strong local attachments and their skill in  finding their way back when removed to a distance. It seems at times  as if they possessed some extra sense--the home sense--which operates  unerringly. I saw this illustrated one spring in the case of a mallard  drake.    My son had two ducks, and to mate with them he procured a drake of a  neighbor who lived two miles south of us.

The story of an island filled with buried treasure, and governed by a  king, whose native subjects were turtles and seagulls, promised to make  interesting writing.    The count was greatly pleased. I believe in me he saw his first  bona-fide settler, and when I rose to go he even lifted one of  the crosses of Trinidad and, before my envious eyes, regarded it  uncertainly.    Perhaps, had he known that of all decorations it was the one I  most desired; had I only then and there booked my passage, or sworn  allegiance to King James, who knows but that to-day I might be a  chevalier, with my name in the \"Book of Gold\"? But instead of bending  the knee, I reached for my hat; the count replaced the cross in its  pasteboard box, and for me the psychological moment had passed.    Others, more deserving of the honor, were more fortunate. Among my  fellow-reporters who, like myself, came to scoff, and remained to pray,  was Henri Pene du Bois, for some time, until his recent death, the  brilliant critic of art and music of the _American_. Then he was on  the _Times_, and Henry N. Cary, now of the _Morning Telegraph_, was his  managing editor.    When Du Bois reported to Cary on his assignment, he said: \"There is  nothing funny in that story. It's pathetic. Both those men are in  earnest. They are convinced they are being robbed of their rights. Their  only fault is that they have imagination, and that the rest of us lack  it. That's the way it struck me, and that's the way the story ought to  be written.\"    \"Write it that way,\" said Cary.    So, of all the New York papers, the _Times_, for a brief period, became  the official organ of the Government of James the First, and in time  Cary and Du Bois were created Chevaliers of the Order of Trinidad, and  entitled to wear uniforms \"Similar to those of the Chamberlains of the  Court, save that the buttons bear the impress of the Royal Crown.\"    The attack made by Great Britain and Brazil upon the independence of the  principality, while it left Harden-Hickey in the position of a king in  exile, brought him at once another crown, which, by those who offered  it to him, was described as of incomparably greater value than that of  Trinidad.    In the first instance the man had sought the throne; in this case the  throne sought the man.    In 1893 in San Francisco, Ralston J. Markowe, a lawyer and a one-time  officer of artillery in the United States army, gained renown as one  of the Morrow filibustering expedition which attempted to overthrow the  Dole government in the Hawaiian Isles and restore to the throne Queen  Liliuokalani. In San Francisco Markowe was nicknamed the \"Prince of  Honolulu,\" as it was understood, should Liliuokalani regain her  crown, he would be rewarded with some high office. But in the star  of Liliuokalani, Markowe apparently lost faith, and thought he saw  in Harden-Hickey timber more suitable for king-making. Accordingly,  twenty-four days after the \"protest\" was sent to our State Department,  Markowe switched his allegiance to Harden-Hickey, and to him addressed  the following letter:    \"SAN FRANCISCO, August 26, 1895.    BARON HARDEN-HICKEY, LOS ANGELES, CAL.:    \"Monseigneur--Your favor of August 16 has been received.    \"1. I am the duly authorized agent of the Royalist party in so far as  it is possible for any one to occupy that position under existing  circumstances. With the Queen in prison and absolutely cut off from  all communication with her friends, it is out of the question for me to  carry anything like formal credentials.    \"2. Alienating any part of the territory cannot give rise to any  constitutional questions, for the reason that the constitutions, like  the land tenures, are in a state of such utter confusion that only a  strong hand can unravel them, and the restoration will result in the  establishment of a strong military government. If I go down with the  expedition I have organized I shall be in full control of the situation  and in a position to carry out all my contracts.    \"3. It is the island of Kauai on which I propose to establish you as an  independent sovereign.    \"4. My plan is to successively occupy all the islands, leaving the  capital to the last. When the others have fallen, the capital, being cut  off from all its resources, will be easily taken, and may very likely  fall without effort. I don't expect in any case to have to fortify  myself or to take the defensive, or to have to issue a call to arms, as  I shall have an overwhelming force to join me at once, in addition to  those who go with me, who by themselves will be sufficient to carry  everything before them without active cooperation from the people there.    \"5. The Government forces consist of about 160 men and boys, with very  imperfect military training, and of whom about forty are officers. They  are organized as infantry. There are also about 600 citizens enrolled  as a reserve guard, who may be called upon in case of an emergency,  and about 150 police. We can fully rely upon the assistance of all the  police and from one-quarter to one-half of the other troops. And of the  remainder many will under no circumstances engage in a sharp fight in  defense of the present government. There are now on the island plenty  of men and arms to accomplish our purpose, and if my expedition does  not get off very soon the people there will be organized to do the work  without other assistance from here than the direction of a few leaders,  of which they stand more in need than anything else.    \"6. The tonnage of the vessel is 146. She at present has berth-room for  twenty men, but bunks can be arranged in the hold for 256 more, with  provision for ample ventilation. She has one complete set of sails and  two extra spars. The remaining information in regard to her I will have  to obtain and send you to-morrow. I think it must be clear to you that  the opportunity now offered you will be of incomparably greater value  at once than Trinidad would ever be. Still hoping that I may have an  interview with you at an early date, respectfully yours,    \"RALSTON J. MARKOWE.\"    What Harden-Hickey thought of this is not known, but as two weeks before  he received it he had written Markowe, asking him by what authority he  represented the Royalists of Honolulu, it seems evident that when the  crown of Hawaii was first proffered him he did not at once spurn it.    He now was in the peculiar position of being a deposed king of an island  in the South Atlantic, which had been taken from him, and king-elect of  an island in the Pacific, which was his if he could take it.    This was in August of 1895. For the two years following, Harden-Hickey  was a soldier of misfortunes. Having lost his island kingdom, he could  no longer occupy himself with plans for its improvement. It had been  his toy. They had taken it from him, and the loss and the ridicule which  followed hurt him bitterly.    And for the lands he really owned in Mexico and California, and which,  if he were to live in comfort, it was necessary he should sell, he  could find no purchaser; and, moreover, having quarrelled with his  father-in-law, he had cut off his former supply of money. The need of it  pinched him cruelly.    The advertised cause of this quarrel was sufficiently characteristic  to be the real one. Moved by the attack of Great Britain upon his  principality, Harden-Hickey decided upon reprisals. It must be  remembered that always he was more Irish than French. On paper  he organized an invasion of England from Ireland, the home of his  ancestors. It was because Flagler refused to give him money for this  adventure that he broke with him. His friends say this was the real  reason of the quarrel, which was a quarrel on the side of Harden-Hickey  alone.    And there were other, more intimate troubles. While not separated from  his wife, he now was seldom in her company. When the Baroness was in  Paris, Harden-Hickey was in San Francisco; when she returned to San  Francisco, he was in Mexico. The fault seems to have been his. He was  greatly admired by pretty women. His daughter by his first wife, now a  very beautiful girl of sixteen, spent much time with her stepmother;  and when not on his father's ranch in Mexico, his son also, for months  together, was at her side. The husband approved of this, but he himself  saw his wife infrequently. Nevertheless, early in the spring of 1898,  the Baroness leased a house in Brockton Square, in Riverside, Cal.,  where it was understood by herself and by her friends her husband would  join her. At that time in Mexico he was trying to dispose of a large  tract of land. Had he been able to sell it, the money for a time would  have kept one even of his extravagances contentedly rich. At least,  he would have been independent of his wife and of her father. Up to  February of 1898 his obtaining this money seemed probable.    Early in that month the last prospective purchaser decided not to buy.    There is no doubt that had Harden-Hickey then turned to his  father-in-law, that gentleman, as he had done before, would have opened  an account for him.    But the Prince of Trinidad felt he could no longer beg, even for the  money belonging to his wife, from the man he had insulted. He could no  longer ask his wife to intercede for him. He was without money of his  own, with out the means of obtaining it; from his wife he had ceased to  expect even sympathy, and from the world he knew, the fact that he was  a self-made king caused him always to be pointed out with ridicule as a  charlatan, as a jest.    The soldier of varying fortunes, the duellist and dreamer, the devout  Catholic and devout Buddhist, saw the forty-third year of his life only  as the meeting-place of many fiascos.    His mind was tormented with imaginary wrongs, imaginary slights,  imaginary failures.    This young man, who could paint pictures, write books, organize colonies"]]]
