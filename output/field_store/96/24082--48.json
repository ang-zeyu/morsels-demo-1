To make use of these, we must  suppose them to be placed above our heads, the center marking the  zenith, and the sky descending all round to the horizon. The horizon,  therefore, bounds these panoramas. Turning the chart in any direction,  and looking at it from north, south, east, or west, we find all the  principal stars. The first map (Fig. 13) represents the sky in winter  (January) at 8 P.M.; the second, in spring (April) at 9 P.M.; the third,  in summer (July) at the same hour; the fourth, the sky in autumn  (October) at the same time.    And so, at little cost, we have made one of the grandest and most  beautiful journeys conceivable. We now have a new country, or, better,  have learned to see and know our own country, for since the Earth is a  planet we must all be citizens of the Heavens before we can belong to  such or such a nation of our lilliputian world.    We must now study this sublime spectacle of the Heavens in detail.          CHAPTER III    THE STARS, SUNS OF THE INFINITE    A JOURNEY THROUGH SPACE      We have seen from the foregoing summary of the principal Constellations  that there is great diversity in the brightness of the stars, and that  while our eyes are dazzled with the brilliancy of certain orbs, others,  on the contrary, sparkle modestly in the azure depths of the night, and  are hardly perceptible to the eye that seeks to plumb the abysses of  Immensity.    We have appended the word \"magnitude\" to the names of certain stars, and  the reader might imagine this to bear some relation to the volume of the  orb. But this is not the case.    To facilitate the observation of stars of varying brilliancy, they have  been classified in order of magnitude, according to their apparent  brightness, and since the dimensions of these distant suns are almost  wholly unknown to us, the most luminous stars were naturally denoted as  of first magnitude, those which were a little less bright of the second,  and so on. But in reality this word \"magnitude\" is quite erroneous, for  it bears no relation to the mass of the stars, divided thus at an epoch  when it was supposed that the most brilliant must be the largest. It  simply indicates the apparent brightness of a star, the real brilliancy  depending on its dimensions, its intrinsic light, and its distance from  our planet.    And now to make some comparison between the different orders. Throughout  the entire firmament, only nineteen stars of first magnitude are  discoverable. And, strictly speaking, the last of this series might just  as well be noted of \"second magnitude,\" while the first of the second  series might be added to the list of stars of the \"first order.\" But in  order to form classes distinct from one another, some limit has to be  adopted, and it was determined that the first series should include only  the following stars, the most luminous in the Heavens, which are  subjoined in order of decreasing brilliancy.      STARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE               1. Sirius, or [alpha] of the Great Dog.             2. Canopus, or [alpha] of the Ship.             3. Capella, or [alpha] of the Charioteer.             4. Arcturus, or [alpha] of the Herdsman.             5. Vega, or [alpha] of the Lyre.             6. Proxima, or [alpha] of the Centaur.             7. Rigel, or [beta] of Orion.             8. Achernar, or [alpha] of Eridanus.             9. Procyon, or [alpha] of the Little Dog.            10. [beta] of the Centaur.            11. Betelgeuse, or [alpha] of Orion.            12. Altair, or [alpha] of the Eagle.            13. [alpha] of the Southern Cross.            14. Aldebaran, or [alpha] of the Bull.            15. Spica, or [alpha] of the Virgin.            16. Antares, or [alpha] of the Scorpion.            17. Pollux, or [beta] of the Twins.            18. Regulus, or [alpha] of the Lion.            19. Fomalhaut, or [alpha] of the Southern Fish.      THE STARS OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE    Then come the stars of the second magnitude, of which there are  fifty-nine. The stars of the Great Bear (with the exception of [delta],  which is of third magnitude), the Pole-Star, the chief stars in Orion  (after Rigel and Betelgeuse), of the Lion, of Pegasus, of Andromeda, of  Cassiopeia, are of this order. These, with the former, constitute the  principal outlines of the constellations visible to us.    Then follow the third and fourth magnitudes, and so on.           *       *       *       *       *    The following table gives a summary of the series, down to the sixth  magnitude, which is the limit of visibility for the unaided human eye:                 19 stars of first magnitude.               59 of second magnitude.              182 of third magnitude.              530 of fourth magnitude.            1,600 of fifth magnitude.            4,800 of sixth magnitude.    This makes a total of some seven thousand stars visible to the unaided  eye. It will be seen that each series is, roughly speaking, three times  as populated as that preceding it; consequently, if we multiply the  number of any class by three, we obtain the approximate number of stars  that make up the class succeeding it.    Seven thousand stars! It is an imposing figure, when one reflects that  all these lucid points are suns, as enormous as they are potent, as  incandescent as our own (which exceeds the volume of the Earth by more  than a million times), distant centers of light and heat, exerting their  attraction on unknown systems. And yet it is generally imagined that  millions of stars are visible in the firmament. This is an illusion;  even the best vision is unable to distinguish stars below the sixth  magnitude, and ordinary sight is far from discovering all of these.    Again, seven thousand stars for the whole Heavens makes only three  thousand five hundred for half the sky. And we can only see one  celestial hemisphere at a time. Moreover, toward the horizon, the vapor  of the atmosphere veils the little stars of sixth magnitude. In reality,  we never see at a given moment more than three thousand stars. This  number is below that of the population of a small town.           *       *       *       *       *    But celestial space is unlimited, and we must not suppose that these  seven thousand stars that fascinate our eyes and enrich our Heavens,  without which our nights would be black, dark, and empty,[5] comprise  the whole of Creation. They only represent the vestibule of the temple.    Where our vision is arrested, a larger, more powerful eye, that is  developing from century to century, plunges its analyzing gaze into the  abysses, and reflects back to the insatiable curiosity of science the  light of the innumerable suns that it discovers. This eye is the lens of  the optical instruments. Even opera-glasses disclose stars of the  seventh magnitude. A small astronomical objective penetrates to the  eighth and ninth orders. More powerful instruments attain the tenth.  The Heavens are progressively transformed to the eye of the astronomer,  and soon he is able to reckon hundreds of thousands of orbs in the  night. The evolution continues, the power of the instrument is  developed; and the stars of the eleventh and twelfth magnitudes are  discovered successively, and together number four millions. Then follow  the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth magnitudes. This is the  sequence:               7th magnitude          13,000.             8th     \"              40,000.             9th     \"             120,000.            10th     \"             380,000.            11th     \"           1,000,000.            12th     \"           3,000,000.            13th     \"           9,000,000.            14th     \"          27,000,000.            15th     \"          80,000,000.    Accordingly, the most powerful telescopes of the day, reenforced by  celestial photography, can bring a stream of more than 120 millions of  stars into the scope of our vision.    The photographic map of the Heavens now being executed comprises the  first fourteen magnitudes, and will give the precise position of some  40,000,000 stars, distributed over 22,054 sheets, forming a sphere 3  meters 44 centimeters in diameter.    The boldest imagination is overwhelmed by these figures, and fails to  picture such millions of suns--formidable and burning globes that roll  through space, sweeping their systems along with them. What furnaces are  there! what unknown lives! what vast immensities!    And again, what enormous distances must separate the stars, to admit of  their free revolution in the ether! In what abysses, at what a distance  from our terrestrial atom, must these magnificent and dazzling Suns  pursue the paths traced for them by Destiny!           *       *       *       *       *    If all the stars radiated an equal light, their distances might be  calculated on the principle that an object appears smaller in proportion  to its distance. But this equality does not exist. The suns were not all  cast in the same mold.    Indeed, the stars differ widely in size and brightness, and the  distances that have been measured show that the most brilliant are not  the nearest. They are scattered through Space at all distances.    Among the nearer stars of which it has been found possible to calculate  the distance, some are found to be of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,  eighth, and even ninth magnitudes, proving that the most brilliant are  not always the least distant.    For the rest, among the beautiful and shining stars with which we made  acquaintance in the last chapter may be cited Sirius, which at a  distance of 92 trillion kilometers (57 trillion miles) from here still  dazzles us with its burning fires; Procyon or [alpha] of the Little Dog,  as remote as 112 trillion kilometers (69-1/2 trillion miles); Altair of  the Eagle, at 160 trillion kilometers (99 trillion miles); the white  Vega, at 204 trillion kilometers ("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#8)"],[1,"times, and have as often  disgraced myself. This is the more annoying, as I was formerly very  happy in taking likenesses. I have since sketched her profile, and must  content myself with that.    JULY 25.    Yes, dear Charlotte! I will order and arrange everything. Only give  me more commissions, the more the better. One thing, however, I must  request: use no more writing-sand with the dear notes you send me. Today  I raised your letter hastily to my lips, and it set my teeth on edge.    JULY 26.    I have often determined not to see her so frequently. But who could keep  such a resolution? Every day I am exposed to the temptation, and promise  faithfully that to-morrow I will really stay away: but, when tomorrow  comes, I find some irresistible reason for seeing her; and, before I can  account for it, I am with her again. Either she has said on the previous  evening \"You will be sure to call to-morrow,\"--and who could stay away  then?--or she gives me some commission, and I find it essential to take  her the answer in person; or the day is fine, and I walk to Walheim;  and, when I am there, it is only half a league farther to her. I am  within the charmed atmosphere, and soon find myself at her side. My  grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone. When any  vessels came near it, they were instantly deprived of their ironwork:  the nails flew to the mountain, and the unhappy crew perished amidst the  disjointed planks.    JULY 30.    Albert is arrived, and I must take my departure. Were he the best and  noblest of men, and I in every respect his inferior, I could not endure  to see him in possession of such a perfect being. Possession!--enough,  Wilhelm: her betrothed is here,--a fine, worthy fellow, whom one cannot  help liking. Fortunately I was not present at their meeting. It would  have broken my heart! And he is so considerate: he has not given  Charlotte one kiss in my presence. Heaven reward him for it! I must love  him for the respect with which he treats her. He shows a regard for me,  but for this I suspect I am more indebted to Charlotte than to his own  fancy for me. Women have a delicate tact in such matters, and it should  be so. They cannot always succeed in keeping two rivals on terms with  each other; but, when they do, they are the only gainers.    I cannot help esteeming Albert. The coolness of his temper contrasts  strongly with the impetuosity of mine, which I cannot conceal. He has  a great deal of feeling, and is fully sensible of the treasure he  possesses in Charlotte. He is free from ill-humour, which you know is  the fault I detest most.    He regards me as a man of sense; and my attachment to Charlotte, and the  interest I take in all that concerns her, augment his triumph and his  love. I shall not inquire whether he may not at times tease her with  some little jealousies; as I know, that, were I in his place, I should  not be entirely free from such sensations.    But, be that as it may, my pleasure with Charlotte is over. Call it  folly or infatuation, what signifies a name? The thing speaks for  itself. Before Albert came, I knew all that I know now. I knew I could  make no pretensions to her, nor did I offer any, that is, as far as it  was possible, in the presence of so much loveliness, not to pant for  its enjoyment. And now, behold me like a silly fellow, staring with  astonishment when another comes in, and deprives me of my love.    I bite my lips, and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me to be  resigned, because there is no help for it. Let me escape from the yoke  of such silly subterfuges! I ramble through the woods; and when I return  to Charlotte, and find Albert sitting by her side in the summer-house  in the garden, I am unable to bear it, behave like a fool, and commit a  thousand extravagances. \"For Heaven's sake,\" said Charlotte today, \"let  us have no more scenes like those of last night! You terrify me when you  are so violent.\" Between ourselves, I am always away now when he visits  her: and I feel delighted when I find her alone.    AUGUST 8.    Believe me, dear Wilhelm, I did not allude to you when I spoke so  severely of those who advise resignation to inevitable fate. I did not  think it possible for you to indulge such a sentiment. But in fact you  are right. I only suggest one objection. In this world one is seldom  reduced to make a selection between two alternatives. There are as many  varieties of conduct and opinion as there are turns of feature between  an aquiline nose and a flat one.    You will, therefore, permit me to concede your entire argument, and yet  contrive means to escape your dilemma.    Your position is this, I hear you say: \"Either you have hopes of  obtaining Charlotte, or you have none. Well, in the first case, pursue  your course, and press on to the fulfilment of your wishes. In the  second, be a man, and shake off a miserable passion, which will enervate  and destroy you.\" My dear friend, this is well and easily said.    But would you require a wretched being, whose life is slowly wasting  under a lingering disease, to despatch himself at once by the stroke of  a dagger? Does not the very disorder which consumes his strength deprive  him of the courage to effect his deliverance?    You may answer me, if you please, with a similar analogy, \"Who would  not prefer the amputation of an arm to the periling of life by doubt and  procrastination!\" But I know not if I am right, and let us leave these  comparisons.    Enough! There are moments, Wilhelm, when I could rise up and shake it  all off, and when, if I only knew where to go, I could fly from this  place.    THE SAME EVENING.    My diary, which I have for some time neglected, came before me today;  and I am amazed to see how deliberately I have entangled myself step by  step. To have seen my position so clearly, and yet to have acted so like  a child! Even still I behold the result plainly, and yet have no thought  of acting with greater prudence.    AUGUST 10.    If I were not a fool, I could spend the happiest and most delightful  life here. So many agreeable circumstances, and of a kind to ensure  a worthy man's happiness, are seldom united. Alas! I feel it too  sensibly,--the heart alone makes our happiness! To be admitted into  this most charming family, to be loved by the father as a son, by the  children as a father, and by Charlotte! then the noble Albert, who never  disturbs my happiness by any appearance of ill-humour, receiving me with  the heartiest affection, and loving me, next to Charlotte, better  than all the world! Wilhelm, you would be delighted to hear us in our  rambles, and conversations about Charlotte. Nothing in the world can be  more absurd than our connection, and yet the thought of it often moves  me to tears.    He tells me sometimes of her excellent mother; how, upon her death-bed,  she had committed her house and children to Charlotte, and had given  Charlotte herself in charge to him; how, since that time, a new spirit  had taken possession of her; how, in care and anxiety for their welfare,  she became a real mother to them; how every moment of her time was  devoted to some labour of love in their behalf,--and yet her mirth and  cheerfulness had never forsaken her. I walk by his side, pluck flowers  by the way, arrange them carefully into a nosegay, then fling them into  the first stream I pass, and watch them as they float gently away. I  forget whether I told you that Albert is to remain here. He has received  a government appointment, with a very good salary; and I understand  he is in high favour at court. I have met few persons so punctual and  methodical in business.    AUGUST 12.    Certainly Albert is the best fellow in the world. I had a strange scene  with him yesterday. I went to take leave of him; for I took it into my  head to spend a few days in these mountains, from where I now write  to you. As I was walking up and down his room, my eye fell upon his  pistols. \"Lend me those pistols,\" said I, \"for my journey.\" \"By all  means,\" he replied, \"if you will take the trouble to load them; for they  only hang there for form.\" I took down one of them; and he continued,  \"Ever since I was near suffering for my extreme caution, I will have  nothing to do with such things.\" I was curious to hear the story. \"I was  staying,\" said he, \"some three months ago, at a friend's house in the  country. I had a brace of pistols with me, unloaded; and I slept without  any anxiety. One rainy afternoon I was sitting by myself, doing nothing,  when it occurred to me I do not know how that the house might be  attacked, that we might require the pistols, that we might in short, you  know how we go on fancying, when we have nothing better to do. I gave  the pistols to the servant, to clean and load. He was playing with the  maid, and trying to frighten her, when the pistol went off--God knows  how!--the ramrod was in the barrel; and it went straight through  her right hand, and shattered the thumb. I had to endure all the  lamentation, and to pay the surgeon's bill; so, since that time, I have  kept all my weapons unloaded. But, my dear friend, what is the use of  prudence? We can never be on our guard against all possible dangers.  However,\"--now, you must know I can tolerate all men till they come to  \"however;\"--for it is self-evident that every universal rule must have  its exceptions. But he is so exceedingly accurate, that, if he only  fancies he has said a word too precipitate, or too general, or only half  true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify, and extenuate, till at last  he appears to have said nothing at all. Upon this occasion, Albert was  deeply immersed in his subject: I ceased to listen to him, and became  lost in reverie. With a sudden motion, I pointed the mouth of the pistol  to my forehead, over the right eye. \"What do you mean?\" cried Albert,  turning back the pistol. \"It is not loaded,\" said I. \"And "]]]
