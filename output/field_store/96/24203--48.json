Large French pears should be crystalized by the latter  process and be almost cold during the operation; being bulky they  retain the heat a long time, and therefore have a great tendency to  grain.      IMITATION INDIAN CORN.      8 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    Yellow Color.    3 pints Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to weak crack, 305; pour the  boil on slab, flavor with lemon and color yellow; cut this boil in two  and pull one-half over the hook; roll the pulled half out in lengths  about the size of a corn pod; now put the plain yellow sugar through the  Tom Thumb drop rollers, loosening the screws a little, and ease the  pulled sugar with sheets from the machine; if done carefully, the result  will be a good imitation of real Indian corn.      POPCORN BALLS.    Roast the corn berries over a smokeless fire in a corn popper (get our  price for corn poppers); keep shaking until every berry has burst; boil  sufficient sugar and water to the degree of feather, 245; add to each 7  lbs. syrup, four ounces of dissolved gum arabic; wet the popped corn in  this syrup, and roll them in fine pulverized sugar until coated all  over, then lay them aside; when dry repeat the coating process in the  same manner until they have taken up the desired thickness of sugar.  Weigh or measure sufficient coated berries, according to size of ball  required, moisten them with thin syrup, partly form the ball by hand,  then put it in a pop corn ball press and press tightly into shape, then  form into balls in the usual way with pop corn ball press.    [Illustration: Pop Corn Ball Press    Makes Balls 3-1/2 inches diameter, has brass cups top and bottom, so  arranged that the ball is pushed out of the cup at each operation.    Any Size Ball made to order.    Price complete any size Ball, $35 00    Fig. 208 a.]      POPCORN BRICKS.    PROCESS.--The corn berries are prepared as for balls; boil brown sugar  in the proportion of 8 lbs. sugar and two pounds molasses to ball, 250;  pour the syrup over the corn and thoroughly mix them; press them  immediately into oiled tins. The process should be done quickly and the  seeds pressed as tightly together as possible; when cold they are ready  for sale and may be cut to size with sharp knife.

PROCESS.--Prepare the corn as for balls and pack them closely into  strong square tins slightly oiled with olive oil of best quality; boil  to crack, sufficient brown sugar and glucose for quantity required and  pour the hot syrup over the pop corns, just enough to make them adhere.  When cold cut them up with a sharp knife the size.

PROCESS.--Mix the ingredients in copper pan; boil on a slow fire to  stiff ball, 250, stirring all the time; add coloring to fancy; when  ready, pour carefully on an oiled plate, making the sheet about half an  inch thick; when cold, dust with pulverized sugar and cut up with sharp  knife to size.    N.B.--A few loose iron bars are useful to form a square on the pouring  plate, in proportion to size of boil; that the exact thickness of sheet  may be determined.

Glucose.    2-1/2 lbs. Farina.    3 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Put the sugar, glucose and water in the pan; place it on a  slow fire; stir in the cocoanut and farina and boil to stiff ball, 255,  keeping it well stirred. Pour on an oiled slab, and cut up to size; when  set, dust with powdered sugar. In large factories where this candy is  made, machinery plays an important part. In fact the manipulation is  practically all done by mechanism. There is the desiccator for preparing  the cocoanuts, the steam pans, which are fitted with beaters revolving  inside, fixed with chains and weights for lifting them out, so that the  cans may be emptied and cleaned without trouble; also plates for rolling  out sheets to size, and cutting machines which cut the nuggets any size,  the machine being so arranged that by simply altering a pawl on a  ratchet wheel the size of the nuggets is determined. Where this  elaborate arrangement exists our formula would neither be desirable nor  necessary, nor do we pretend to suggest or advise. However, many tons  are made in the ordinary boiling shop with the usual appliances and  conveniences, and it is to assist people thus situated is the principal  object of this book.      JAP NUGGETS NO. 3.      4 lbs. Good Brown Sugar.    3-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints Water.    4 lbs. Desiccated Cocoanut Unsweetened.    2 lbs. Farina.    PROCESS.--As before, brown coloring should be used if required dark; it  makes goods look richer; when the boil is cut up the nuggets should be  thrown into pulverized sugar.      VANILLA NOUGAT (Common.)      12 lbs. White Sugar.    3 lbs. glucose.    1/2 oz. Essence Vanilla.    4 lbs. Sweet Almonds small.    3 pints water.    PROCESS.--Put the sugar, glucose and water in a clean pan, place it on a  sharp fire and stir until dissolved; then put on the cover and let it  boil for five or six minutes; now remove the lid and continue to boil to  soft ball degree; now pour the contents on a damp slab (one over which  water has been sprinkled); when cool take a long flat spatula and work  the sugar about until it becomes white and creamy; now add the almonds  (which have been previously blanched and dried), together with the  vanilla essence; keep working up the whole until of uniform consistency;  now spread the mass on wafer paper in sheets one inch thick, cover the  sheets with wafer paper, rolling the top smooth; when set cut into bars.  Should the cream be a little thin add some icing sugar when mixing; if  boiled properly this is not required. Most cheap Nougats now in the  market are made more or less according to this formula, color and flavor  differently for variety.      ICE CREAM CONFECTIONERY.    Boil 7 lbs. of loaf sugar with three pints of water: add a small  teaspoonful of cream of tartar, allow it to boil for 10 minutes, then  add one pound of fresh butter: it will then commence to froth up, and  care must be taken that the pan is large enough, as the syrup will  occupy twice the space than if there had been no butter added; boil this  mixture to the degree of very weak crack, or 285 by the thermometer, at  which point it is done; pour it on the slab, which has been of course  previously greased. As soon as it begins to cool, turn it up and knead  it until it gets stiff enough to pull over the hook. When on the hook  pull it sharp till it gets white as snow. This white is usually flavored  with vanilla or oil of lemon. It may be either pulled out in bars or  left in the heap. It is very easily broken in small pieces for retail  purposes. In the summer or hot weather keep this candy from the air, or  it will be inclined to be sticky. This eats very rich and commands good  sale at best prices.      RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM CONFECTIONERY.    This is made exactly as the last with the addition of a little red color  before the boil is poured out, or it may be colored on the slab; add a  little essence of raspberry or strawberry and a pinch of tartaric acid  just before pulling the boil. Color the raspberry a little deeper than  the strawberry.      CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.    To make chocolate ice cream, boil the same quantities as before  precisely in the same way in every particular. When the sugar has been  pulled out, work well into it 1/2 lb. powdered chocolate; knead this  well up in order that the chocolate may be well mixed with the sugar.  Put in sufficient chocolate to give the boil a dark brown color,  otherwise it would be too light when pulled.      VANILLA CARAMELS.      8 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    1 lb. Fresh Butter.    2 Tins Condensed milk.    2 pints water.    Vanilla Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to the degree of ball 250;  remove the pan a little from the fire, add the milk and butter, the  latter cut into little pieces and well stir in with wooden spatula until  the whole is thoroughly mixed, then gently bring the mass through the  boil and pour out on greased slab, making the sheet about 1/2 inch  thick; when set cut with caramel cutter, and when cold separate the  squares and wrap in wax paper.      COCOANUT CARAMELS.      8 lbs. Sugar.    2 lbs. glucose.    1 lb. Fresh Butter.    1-1/2 lbs. Desiccated Cocoanut, unsweetened.    2 Tins Condensed Milk.    2 pints water.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water, add the glucose and boil up to  ball 250; remove the pan to side, then stir in the butter, milk and  cocoanut, bring through the boil, pour on slab or in frames about 1/2  inch thick; when set mark with caramel cutter; when cold separate and  wrap in wax paper.

He was an adept at 'tree,' 'dodge,' and 'squat,' he could play  'log-lump,' with 'wind' and 'baulk' with 'back-track' so well that he  scarcely needed any other tricks. He had not yet tried it, but he knew  just how to play 'barb-wire,' which is a new trick of the brilliant  order; he had made a special study of 'sand,' which burns up all scent,  and was deeply versed in 'change-off,' 'fence,' and 'double' as well as  'hole-up,' which is a trick requiring longer notice, and yet he never  forgot that 'lie-low' is the beginning of all wisdom and 'brierbrush'  the only trick that is always safe.    He was taught the signs by which to know all his foes and then the way  to baffle them. For hawks, owls, foxes, hounds, curs, minks, weasels,  cats, skunks, coons, and--men, each have a different plan of pursuit,  and for each and all of these evils he was taught a remedy.    And for knowledge of the enemy's approach he learnt to depend first  on himself and his mother, and then on the bluejay. \"Never neglect the  bluejay's warning,\" said Molly; \"he is a mischief-maker, a marplot, and  a thief all the time, but nothing escapes him. He wouldn't mind harming  us, but he cannot, thanks to the briers, and his enemies are ours, so  it is well to heed him. If the woodpecker cries a warning you can trust  him, he is honest; but he is a fool beside the bluejay, and though the  bluejay often tells lies for mischief you are safe to believe him when  he brings ill news.\"    The barb-wire trick takes a deal of nerve and the best of legs. It was  long before Rag ventured to play it, but as he came to his full powers  it became one of his favorites.    \"It's fine play for those who can do it,\" said Molly. \"First you lead  off your dog on a straightaway and warm him up a bit by nearly letting  him catch you. Then keeping just one hop ahead, you lead him at a long  slant full tilt into a breast-high barb-wire. I've seen many a dog and  fox crippled, and one big hound killed outright this way. But I've also  seen more than one rabbit lose his life in trying it.\"    Rag early learnt what some rabbits never learn at all, that 'hole-up' is  not such a fine ruse as it seems; it may be the certain safety of a wise  rabbit, but soon or late is a sure death-trap to a fool. A young rabbit  always thinks of it first, an old rabbit never tries it till all others  fail. It means escape from a man or dog, a fox or a bird of prey, but it  means sudden death if the foe is a ferret, mink, skunk, or weasel.    There were but two ground-holes in the Swamp. One on the Sunning Bank,  which was a dry sheltered knoll in the South-end. It was open and  sloping to the sun, and here on fine days the Cottontails took their  sun-baths. They stretched out among the fragrant pine needles and  winter-green in odd cat-like positions, and turned slowly over as though  roasting and wishing all sides well done. And they blinked and panted,  and squirmed as if in dreadful pain; yet this was one of the keenest  enjoyments they knew.    Just over the brow of the knoll was a large pine stump. Its grotesque  roots wriggled out above the yellow sand-bank like dragons, and under  their protecting claws a sulky old woodchuck had digged a den long ago.    He became more sour and ill-tempered as weeks went by, and one day  waited to quarrel with Olifant's dog instead of going in so that Molly  Cottontail was able to take possession of the den an hour later.    This, the pine-root hole, was afterward very coolly taken by a  self-sufficient young skunk who with less valor might have enjoyed  greater longevity, for he imagined--that even man with a gun would fly  from him. Instead of keeping Molly from the den for good, therefore, his  reign, like that of a certain Hebrew king, was over in seven days.    The other, the fern-hole, was in a fern thicket next the clover field.  It was small and damp, and useless except as a last retreat. It also  was the work of a woodchuck, a well-meaning friendly neighbor, but  a harebrained youngster whose skin in the form of a whiplash was now  developing higher horse-power in the Olifant working team.    \"Simple justice,\" said the old man, \"for that hide was raised on stolen  feed that the team would a' turned into horse-power anyway.\"    The Cottontails were now sole owners of the holes, and did not go near  them when they could help it, lest anything like a path should be made  that might betray these last retreats to an enemy. There was also the  hollow hickory, which, though nearly fallen, was still green, and had  the great advantage of being open at both ends. This had long been the  residence of one Lotor, a solitary old coon whose ostensible calling was  frog-hunting, and who, like the monks of old, was supposed to abstain  from all flesh food. But it was shrewdly suspected that he needed but  a chance to indulge in a diet of rabbit. When at last one dark night he  was killed while raiding Olifant's henhouse, Molly, so far from feeling  a pang of regret, took possession of his cosy nest with a sense of  unbounded relief.    IV    Bright August sunlight was flooding the Swamp in the morning. Everything  seemed soaking in the warm radiance. A little brown swamp-sparrow was  teetering on a long rush in the pond. Beneath him there were open spaces  of dirty water that brought down a few scraps of the blue sky, and  worked it and the yellow duck-weed into an exquisite mosaic, with a  little wrong-side picture of the bird in the middle. On the bank behind  was a great vigorous growth of golden green skunk-cabbage, that cast  dense shadow over the brown swamp tussocks.    The eyes of the swamp-sparrow were not trained to take in the color  glories, but he saw what we might have missed; that two of the  numberless leafy brown bumps under the broad cabbage-leaves were  furry living things, with noses that never ceased to move up and down,  whatever else was still.    It was Molly and Rag. They were stretched under the skunk-cabbage, not  because they liked its rank smell, but because the winged ticks could  not stand it at all and so left them in peace.    Rabbits have no set time for lessons, they are always learning; but what  the lesson is depends on the present stress, and that must arrive before  it is known. They went to this place for a quiet rest, but had not been  long there when suddenly a warning note from the ever-watchful bluejay  caused Molly's nose and ears to go up and her tail to tighten to her  back. Away across the Swamp was Olifant's big black and white dog,  coming straight toward them.    \"Now,\" said Molly, \"squat while I go and keep that fool out of  mischief.\" Away she went to meet him and she fearlessly dashed across  the dog's path.    \"Bow-ow-ow,\" he fairly yelled as he bounded after Molly, but she kept  just beyond his reach and led him where the million daggers struck fast  and deep, till his tender ears were scratched raw, and guided him at  last plump into a hidden barbed-wire fence, where he got such a gashing  that he went homeward howling with pain. After making a short double,  a loop and a baulk in case the dog should come back, Molly returned to  find that Rag in his eagerness was standing bolt upright and craning his  neck to see the sport.    This disobedience made her so angry that she struck him with her hind  foot and knocked him over in the mud.    One day as they fed on the near clover field a red-tailed hawk came  swooping after them. Molly kicked up her hind legs to make fun of him  and skipped into the briers along one of their old pathways, where  of course the hawk could not follow. It was the main path from the  Creekside Thicket to the Stove-pipe brushpile. Several creepers had  grown across it, and Molly, keeping one eye on the hawk, set to work and  cut the creepers off. Rag watched her, then ran on ahead, and cut some  more that were across the path. \"That's right,\" said Molly, \"always keep  the runways clear, you will need them often enough. Not wide, but clear.  Cut everything like a creeper across them and some day you will find you  have cut a snare.\" \"A what?\" asked Rag, as he scratched his right ear  with his left hind foot.    \"A snare is something that looks like a creeper, but it doesn't grow and  it's worse than all the hawks in the world,\" said Molly, glancing at the  now far-away red-tail, \"for there it hides night and day in the runway  till the chance to catch you comes.\"    \"I don't believe it could catch me,\" said Rag, with the pride of youth  as he rose on his heels to rub his chin and whiskers high up on a smooth  sapling. Rag did not know he was doing this, but his mother saw and knew  it was a sign, like the changing of a boy's voice, that her little one  was no longer a baby but would soon be a grown-up Cottontail.    V    There is magic in running water. Who does not know it and feel it? The  railroad builder fearlessly throws his bank across the wide bog or lake,  or the sea itself, but the tiniest ril of running water he treats with  great respect, studies its wish and its way and gives it all it seems to  ask. The thirst-parched traveller in the poisonous alkali deserts holds  back in deadly fear from the sedgy ponds till he finds one down whose  centre is a thin, clear line, and a faint flow, the sign of running,  living water, and joyfully he drinks.    There is magic in running water, no evil spell can cross it. Tam  O'Shanter proved its potency in time of sorest need. The wild-wood  creature with its deadly foe following tireless on the trail scent,  realizes its nearing doom and feels an awful spell. Its strength is  spent, its every trick is tried in vain till the good Angel leads it  to the water, the running, living water, and dashing in it follows the  cooling stream, and then with force renewed--takes to the woods again.
