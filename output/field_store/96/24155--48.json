Robinson renders it thus: \"To the spirits of the just advanced to  perfect happiness and glory.\"    It is spoken of God in reference to his immateriality. John, iv, 24. Of  Christ in his exalted spiritual nature in distinction from his human  nature. In Hebrews, ix, 14, in contrast with perishable nature. \"The  _eternal spirit_,\" Holy spirit, spirit of God.--_Robinson's Lexicon._    From all this it will be seen that it is impossible to limit the term  spirit to its ancient _physical_ currency. Our term _mind_ is, for two  reasons, a better word for its place in modern literature. First, it never  had a physical application. Second, the terms are used indifferently in  the New Testament when they relate to man. See Romans, i, 9 and vii, 25.  All spirits are _one_ in kind; in _character_ the difference lies; that  is, spirits are all _imperishable_. It is not in the nature of a spirit to  cease to be. If it is, then there is no imperishable nature that is  revealed to man. I submit for consideration the thought that there is no  difference in the final results between the man who denies the existence  of spirits altogether and the man who allows that spirits may cease to  exist.    \"We are cognizant of the existence of spirit by our direct consciousness  of feelings, desires and ideas, which are to us the most certain of all  realities.\"--_Carpenter._    \"The body continually requires new materials and a continued action of  external agencies. But the mind, when it has been once called into  activity and has become stored with ideas, may remain active and may  develop new relations and combinations among these, after the complete  closure of the sensorial inlets by which new ideas can be excited 'ab  externo.' Such, in fact, is what is continually going on in the state of  dreaming.... The mind thus feeds upon the store of ideas which it has laid  up during the activity of the sensory organs, and those impressions which  it retains in its consciousness are working up into a never ending variety  of combinations and successions of ideas, thus affording new sources of  mental activity even to the very end of life.\"--_Carpenter._    In death the spirit returns to God, who gave it, retaining, doubtless, all  its store of ideas and all its own inherent activities, which will  continue while eternity endures.            OUR RELATIONS TO THE ANCIENT LAW AND PROPHETS--WHAT ARE THEY?      The above questions can not be answered intelligently without a knowledge  of the character of the law, and of its relations to humanity, as well as  a knowledge of the relations of the ancient prophets. The law given at  Sinai as a \"covenant,\" with all the laws contained in the \"Book of the  Law,\" was political in character; that is to say, it pertained to a  community or nation. Such law is _always_ political in its character. The  ancient law pertained to the nation of the Jews. It was given to them as a  community, and to no other people. Moses said, \"And the Lord spake unto  you out of the midst of fire: Ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no  similitude; only ye heard a voice. And he declared unto you his covenant,  which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote  them upon two tables of stone.\" Deut. iv, 12, 13. \"And the Lord said unto  Moses, Write thou these words; for after the _tenor_ of these words I have  made a covenant _with thee_ and _with Israel_.... And he wrote upon the  tables _the words of the covenant_, the ten commandments.\" Exodus xxxiv,  27, 28. \"The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. The Lord _made  not_ this covenant with our fathers, but with us, who _are_ all of us here  alive this day.\" Deut. v, 2, 3. \"Behold, I have taught you statutes and  judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in  the land whither ye go to possess it. Keep, therefore, and do them; for  this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations,  which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is  a wise and understanding people. For what nation is there so great who  hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we  call upon him for? And what nation is there so great that hath statutes  and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this  day.\" Deut. iv, 5, 8.    The law or covenant, as written upon the two tables of stone, is given in  full in one place, and only one, in all the book of the law, and I will  now transcribe it from the fifth chapter of Deut. Here it is: \"I am the  Lord, thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house  of bondage; thou shalt have none other gods before me; thou shalt not make  thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven  above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath  the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them or serve them, for I,  the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers  upon the children unto the third and fourth _generation_ of them that hate  me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my  commandments.    \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain; for the Lord  will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.    \"Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord, thy God, hath commanded  thee. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh is  the Sabbath of the Lord, thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work; thou,  nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor  thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy  gates, that thy man-servant and maid-servant may rest as well as thou; and  remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord,  thy God, brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched  out arm; THEREFORE, THE LORD, THY GOD, COMMANDED THEE TO KEEP THE SABBATH  DAY.    \"Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee;  that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee in the  land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.    \"Thou shalt not kill.    \"Neither shalt thou commit adultery.    \"Neither shalt thou steal.    \"Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.    \"Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's wife, neither shalt thou covet  thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant,  his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbor's.    \"These words the Lord spake unto _all your assembly_ in the mount, out of  the midst of the fire, of the cloud and of the thick darkness, with a  great voice; and he _added no more_. And _he wrote them in two tables of  stone_, and delivered them unto me.\"    This is the covenant as it was written upon the tables of stone. It is, by  its facts, limited to the Jews, for they are the only people who were ever  delivered from bondage in Egypt. The abrogation of this covenant is  clearly presented in the following language, found in Zechariah, the  eleventh chapter and tenth verse: \"And I took my staff, even Beauty, and  cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with _all  the people_. And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock  that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. And I said unto  them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they  weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.\" This language had its  fulfillment in the sale which Judas Iscariot made of his Lord and the  abrogation of the ancient covenant or law.    The prophets were not confined to the kingdom of Israel, or to any one  kingdom, nor yet to any one dispensation.    They bore the word of the Lord to all the nations, as we learn from such  language as this: \"The burden of the word of the Lord to Ninevah, to  Sidon, to Tyre, to Idumea, to Babylon, to Samaria, to Egypt,\" and to many  others. It is very remarkable that no such latitude or longitude of  relationships belongs to the ancient law. It was confined to the  Israelites.    The Heavenly Father spake not to the ancients by his Son, but by the  prophets. And much of that which they spake pertained to our own  dispensation and to our own religion.    Much, very much, of that which they gave lies in the very foundation of  our religion. We should always distinguish, _carefully_, between the Law  and the prophets, and between these two and the psalms, remembering,  however, that prophesy belongs also to many of the psalms. The abrogated  covenant, or law, that was done away, was written upon stones. It, with  all the laws which were after its _tenor_, was supplanted by the law of  Christ. It was added because of transgression _till Christ, _\"the seed,\"  should come. When he came it expired by limitation, and through his  authority the neighborly restrictions or limitations were taken off from  moral precepts, which were re-enacted by him.            THE FUNERAL SERVICES OF THE NATIONAL LIBERAL LEAGUE.      The decent members of the Liberal League, who formed it to express their  convictions, and who withdrew and formed a rival League when they found  that the old organization had gone over to the defense of indecency, who  gave to the League all the character it had, and who had great hopes at  one time of destroying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#8)"],[1,"  intently at the Spirit's robe, \"but I see something strange, and not  belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a  claw?\"    \"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\" was the Spirit's  sorrowful reply. \"Look here.\"    From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched,  abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and  clung upon the outside of its garment.    They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but  prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have  filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a  stale and shriveled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted  them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat  enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no  degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the  mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and  dread.    Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he  tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,  rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.    \"Spirit, are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.    \"They are Man's,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon them. \"And they  cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This  girl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of  all beware of this boy.\"    \"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.    \"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him for the last  time with his own words. \"Are there no work-houses?\"    The bell struck twelve.    Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last  stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob  Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and  hooded, coming like a mist along the ground toward him.      STAVE FOUR.    THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS.      The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near  him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which  this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.    It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its  face, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched  hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure  from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was  surrounded.    He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that  its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,  for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.    \"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?\" said  Scrooge.    The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.    \"You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,  but will happen in the time before us,\" Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so,  Spirit?\"    The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its  folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer  he received.    Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the  silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found  that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit  paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to  recover.    But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague  uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were  ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his  own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great  heap of black.    \"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more than any spectre I  have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good and as I hope to  live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you  company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?\"    It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.    \"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is  precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!\"    The Phantom moved away as it had come toward him. Scrooge followed in  the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him  along.    They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to  spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they  were in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried  up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in  groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their  great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.    The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing  that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their  talk.    \"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I don't know much  about it either way. I only know he's dead.\"    \"When did he die?\" inquired another.    \"Last night, I believe.\"    \"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced gentleman with a  pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills  of a turkey-cock.    \"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin, yawning again.  \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to _me_. That's all  I know.\"    This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.    \"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same speaker; \"for  upon my life I don't know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a  party and volunteer?\"    \"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the gentleman with  the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must be fed, if I make one.\"    Another laugh.    \"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\" said the first  speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I'll  offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I'm not  at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to  stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"    Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.  Scrooge knew the men, and looked toward the Spirit for explanation. He  was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach  importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured  that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what  it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing  on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was past, and this  Ghost's province was the future. Nor could he think of any one  immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them.    They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,  where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognized its  situation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops  and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.  Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of  smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole  quarter reeked with crime, with filth and misery.    Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling  shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and  greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of  rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse  iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinize were bred  and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and  sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a  charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly  seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air  without, by a frowsy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a  line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.    Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a  woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely  entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was  closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by  the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each  other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man  with a pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.    \"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who had entered  first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the  undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a  chance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!\"    \"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe, removing his  pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlor.\"    The parlor was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked  the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky  lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it into his  mouth again.    While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on  the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her  elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.  \"Now, then!\" cried the woman. \"Who's the worse for the loss of a few  things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.\"    \"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.    \"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,\"  pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had  been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with  Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"    \"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs. Dilber. \"It's a  judgment on him.\"    \"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\""]]]
