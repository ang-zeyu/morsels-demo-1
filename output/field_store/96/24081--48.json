Here we approach a  section of the teaching which has manifestly a two-fold meaning. The  first is physical, and concerns the bodily position of the student, and  the regulation of breathing. These things have their direct influence  upon soul-life, the life of the spiritual man, since it is always and  everywhere true that our study demands a sound mind in a sound  body. The present sentence declares that, for work and for meditation,  the position of the body must be steady and without strain, in order  that the finer currents of life may run their course.    It applies further to the poise of the soul, that fine balance and  stability which nothing can shake, where the consciousness rests on the  firm foundation of spiritual being. This is indeed the house set upon a  rock, which the winds and waves beat upon in vain.    47. Right poise is to be gained by steady and temperate effort, and by  setting the heart upon the everlasting.    Here again, there is the two-fold meaning, for physical poise is to be  gained by steady effort of the muscles, by gradual and wise training,  linked with a right understanding of, and relation with, the universal  force of gravity. Uprightness of body demands that both these  conditions shall be fulfilled.    In like manner the firm and upright poise of the spiritual man is to be  gained by steady and continued effort, always guided by wisdom, and  by setting the heart on the Eternal, filling the soul with the atmosphere  of the spiritual world. Neither is effective without the other.  Aspiration without effort brings weakness; effort without aspiration  brings a false strength, not resting on enduring things. The two  together make for the right poise which sets the spiritual man firmly  and steadfastly on his feet.    48 The fruit of right poise is the strength to resist the shocks of  infatuation or sorrow.    In the simpler physical sense, which is also coveted by the wording of  the original, this sentence means that wise effort establishes such  bodily poise that the accidents of life cannot disturb it, as the captain  remains steady, though disaster overtake his ship.    But the deeper sense is far more important. The spiritual man, too,  must learn to withstand all shocks, to remain steadfast through the  perturbations of external things and the storms and whirlwinds of the  psychical world. This is the power which is gained by wise,  continuous effort, and by filling the spirit with the atmosphere of the  Eternal.    49. When this is gained, there follows the right guidance of the  life-currents, the control of the incoming and outgoing breath.    It is well understood to-day that most of our maladies come from  impure conditions of the blood. It is coming to be understood that  right breathing, right oxygenation, will do very much to keep the  blood clean and pure. Therefore a right knowledge of breathing is a  part of the science of life.    But the deeper meaning is, that the spiritual man, when he has gained  poise through right effort and aspiration, can stand firm, and guide the  currents of his life, both the incoming current of events, and the  outgoing current of his acts.    Exactly the same symbolism is used in the saying: Not that which  goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the  mouth, this defileth a man.... Those things which proceed out of the  mouth come forth from the heart ... out of the heart proceed evil  thoughts, murders, uncleanness, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.  Therefore the first step in purification is to keep the Commandments.    50. The life-current is either outward, or inward, or balanced; it is  regulated according to place, time, number; it is prolonged and subtle.  The technical, physical side of this has its value. In the breath, there  should be right inbreathing, followed by the period of pause, when the  air comes into contact with the blood, and this again followed by right  outbreathing, even, steady, silent. Further, the lungs should be evenly  filled; many maladies may arise from the neglect and consequent  weakening of some region of the lungs. And the number of breaths is  so important, so closely related to health, that every nurse's chart  records it.    But the deeper meaning is concerned with the currents of life; with  that which goeth into and cometh out of the heart.    51. The fourth degree transcends external and internal objects.    The inner meaning seems to be that, in addition to the three degrees  of control already described, control, that is, over the incoming  current of life, over the outgoing current, and over the condition of  pause or quiesence, there is a fourth degree of control, which holds in  complete mastery both the outer passage of events and the inner  currents of thoughts and emotions; a condition of perfect poise and  stability in the midst of the flux of things outward and inward.    52. Thereby is worn away the veil which covers up the light.    The veil is the psychic nature, the web of emotions, desires,  argumentative trains of thought, which cover up and obscure the truth  by absorbing the entire attention and keeping the consciousness in the  psychic realm. When hopes and fears are reckoned at their true worth,  in comparison with lasting possessions of the Soul; when the outer  reflections of things have ceased to distract us from inner realities;  when argumentative-thought no longer entangles us, but yields its  place to flashing intuition, the certainty which springs from within;  then is the veil worn away, the consciousness is drawn from the  psychical to the spiritual, from the temporal to the Eternal. Then is the  light unveiled.    53. Thence comes the mind's power to hold itself in the light.    It has been well said, that what we most need is the faculty of spiritual  attention; and in the same direction of thought it has been eloquently  declared that prayer does not consist in our catching God's attention,  but rather in our allowing God to hold our attention.    The vital matter is, that we need to disentangle our consciousness  from the noisy and perturbed thraldom of the psychical, and to come  to consciousness as the spiritual man. This we must do, first, by  purification, through the Commandments and the Rules; and, second,  through the faculty of spiritual attention, by steadily heeding endless  fine intimations of the spiritual power within us, and by intending our  consciousness thereto; thus by degrees transferring the centre of  consciousness from the psychical to the spiritual. It is a question, first,  of love, and then of attention.    54. The right Withdrawal is the disengaging of the powers from  entanglement in outer things, as the psychic nature has been  withdrawn and stilled.    To understand this, let us reverse the process, and think of the one  consciousness, centred in the Soul, gradually expanding and taking on  the form of the different perceptive powers; the one will, at the same  time, differentiating itself into the varied powers of action.    Now let us imagine this to be reversed, so that the spiritual force,  which has gone into the differentiated powers, is once more gathered  together into the inner power of intuition and spiritual will, taking on  that unity which is the hall-mark of spiritual things, as diversity is the  seal of material things.    It is all a matter of love for the quality of spiritual consciousness, as  against psychical consciousness, of love and attention. For where the  heart is, there will the treasure be also; where the consciousness is,  there will the vesture with its powers be developed.    55. Thereupon follows perfect mastery over the powers.    When the spiritual condition which we have described is reached, with  its purity, poise, and illuminated vision, the spiritual man is coming  into his inheritance, and gaining complete mastery of his powers.    Indeed, much of the struggle to keep the Commandments and the  Rules has been paving the way for this mastery; through this very  struggle and sacrifice the mastery has become possible; just as, to use  St. Paul's simile, the athlete gains the mastery in the contest and the  race through the sacrifice of his long and arduous training. Thus he  gains the crown.        INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III    The third book of the Sutras is the Book of Spiritual Powers. In  considering these spiritual powers, two things must be understood and  kept in memory. The first of these is this: These spiritual powers can  only be gained when the development described in the first and second  books has been measurably attained; when the Commandments have  been kept, the Rules faithfully followed, and the experiences which are  described have been passed through. For only after this is the spiritual  man so far grown, so far disentangled from the psychical bandages  and veils which have confined and blinded him, that he can use his  proper powers and faculties. For this is the secret of all spiritual  powers: they are in no sense an abnormal or supernatural overgrowth  upon the material man, but are rather the powers and faculties inherent  in the spiritual man, entirely natural to him, and coming naturally into  activity, as the spiritual man is disentangled and liberated from  psychical bondage, through keeping the Commandments and Rules  already set forth.    As the personal man is the limitation and inversion of the spiritual  man, all his faculties and powers are inversions of the powers of the  spiritual man. In a single phrase, his self seeking is the inversion of the  Self-seeking which is the very being of the spiritual man: the ceaseless  search after the divine and august Self of all beings. This inversion is  corrected by keeping the Commandments and Rules, and gradually,  as the inversion is overcome, the spiritual man is extricated, and  comes into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#8)"],[1,"turned into stalls for wares, and, in a word,  Inigo Jones' work more than undone. Other doings of the soldiery are  unfit for publication.[34]    =The Restoration.=--Juxon was translated to Canterbury, and the  munificent and much-abused Gilbert Sheldon received London, only in  turn to succeed Juxon again three years later. At the beginning of the  Civil War the deanery had become vacant, and Richard Steward  designated for the vacancy. It was an empty appointment, and was  afterwards changed for another of a like kind, and Matthew Nicolas  became nominally dean. This preferment took actual effect from the  summer of 1660, when Nicolas was installed dean and prebendary of  Caddington Major, such of the other dignitaries as survived resuming  their stalls, and vacancies were filled up. Another bay was added to  the Burgess conventicle, and the cathedral services were resumed. But  the sad condition of the fabric called for action, and in 1663 another  Commission was appointed, and CHRISTOPHER WREN appointed  surveyor. Taking example from his uncle's cathedral at Ely, he  suggested an enlargement of the area at the junction of the four  members of the cross, and subscriptions were raised.    =The Plague.=--There is a gap in the subscription list after March,  1665: the pestilence was already at work. As the summer advanced its  ravages were intensified; and the City, fortunate in escaping earlier  attacks, suffered so severely that the pest-houses proved  insufficient; and Harrison Ainsworth is responsible for a story which  may probably be depended on in its main outlines. The Lord Mayor and  City authorities, in conjunction with the College of Physicians,  obtained the consent of Dean Sancroft (the second from Nicolas) and  his chapter for the conversion of the cathedral into a lazar-house;  and a meeting was held in the Chapter House, at which the Primate  Sheldon was present. Sheldon employed himself, co-operating with the  Lord Mayor, in making provision for the victims. \"Chapels and  shrines,\" says Ainsworth, \"formerly adorned with rich sculptures and  costly ornaments, but stripped of them at times when they were looked  upon as idolatrous and profane, were now occupied by nurses,  chirurgeons and their attendants; while every niche and corner was  filled with surgical instruments, phials, drugs, poultices, foul rags  and linen.\"[35] After its chequered career, Old St. Paul's was  destined to be used last of all as a hospital.    =The Fire.=--The house and Navy office of Samuel Pepys were in  Seething Lane, Crutched Friars, near where Fenchurch Street Station  now is. About three in the morning of Sunday, September 2, 1666,  Samuel and his wife were called by their servant Jane, who told them  of a fire visible in the south-west towards London Bridge. After  looking out, not thinking it a great matter, the couple returned to  bed; but getting up at seven Pepys heard a far worse account, and  instead of attending morning service went to the Tower, and called on  his neighbour Sir John Robinson, the Lieutenant. Robinson told him  that the house of Faryner, baker to the king, in Pudding Lane had just  caught fire, that Fish Street was in flames, and the church of St.  Magnus destroyed. These were near the north end of London Bridge, as  the Monument and St. Magnus both remind us.    The origin of the Fire Pepys learnt later (February 24, 1667).  Faryner's people had occasion to light a candle at midnight; they went  as usual into their bakehouse to light it, but as the fire had gone  out, had to seek elsewhere. This striking a light in an unusual place  by Faryner, his son and daughter, is asserted to have been, somehow  and all unknown to them, the origin of the Fire. \"Which is,\" says  Pepys, \"a strange thing, that so horrid an effect should have so mean  and uncertain a beginning.\" About two in the morning, when the family  were upstairs and asleep again, the choking sensation of smoke woke  them up, just in time to escape and tell the tale.       [Illustration: ST. PAUL'S IN FLAMES.     _Originally engraved by Hollar for the title of Dean (afterwards     Archbishop) Sancroft's sermon on the Great Fire._]    There was a drought, and the flames spread on their mission of  devastation, assisted by a breeze. St. Paul's and most of the hundred  City churches were not likely to be used for worship that morning. \"To  see the churches all filling with goods by people who themselves  should have been quietly there at the time.\" But service was held as  usual at the Abbey; and just about sermon time, a newly elected king's  scholar, Taswell, noticing a stir and commotion--he was standing by  the pulpit steps--ascertained the cause. The news had spread that the  City was in flames. Like most boys the prospect of something exciting  coincided with his desire to escape a long sermon, so he hastened  outside in time to see four boats on the river, the occupants of which  had escaped in blankets. Let us hope that as he was not fully  admitted, he escaped Busby's birch. All through the Sunday St. Paul's  was safe--the distance from Pudding Lane was a little over half a  mile--and even the east end of Lombard Street was intact. The  parishioners of St. Gregory and St. Faith, lulled into a false sense  of security, remained confident that even though the conflagration  spread westward, and the surrounding houses caught fire, the flames  would not leap across the vacant space of churchyard; and the  booksellers accordingly began to store their goods in St. Faith's as  though the crypt were a fireproof safe.[36] So it might possibly have  been, and in spite of sparks, had the distracted Lord Mayor been firm  enough to prevent the storing of books in the churchyard, and had the  cathedral roof been in good repair. The flames gradually encircled the  churchyard; the goods there took fire, and the flames caught the end  of a board placed on the roof to keep out the wet. The Nemesis of  neglect!    Our young friend Taswell first saw the flame at eight o'clock on the  Tuesday evening at Westminster. It broke out at the top of St. Paul's  Church, almost scorched up by the violent heat of the air and  lightning too, and before nine blazed so conspicuous \"as to enable me  to read very clearly a 16mo. edition of Terence, which I carried in my  pocket.\"    Pepys corroborates as to the day \"Paul's is burned and all Cheapside,\"  writing of Tuesday, September 4th; and under the same date, Evelyn  adds: \"The stones of St. Paul's flew like grenades, the melting lead  running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements glowing  with a fiery redness, so as no horse or man was able to tread on them,  _and the demolition had stopped all the passages, so that no help  could be applied_, the eastern wind still more impetuously driving the  flames forward.\" By Wednesday night the central section of the City  was so burnt out that Pepys walked through Cheapside and Newgate  market. \"It is a strange thing,\" he remarks, \"to see how long the time  did look since Sunday.\" \"Sad sight,\" he adds next day, \"to see how the  river looks: no houses nor church near it.\" Friday, the 7th, early: \"A  miserable sight of Paul's Church with all the roofs fallen in, and the  body of the quire fallen into St. Fayth's; Paul's School also, Ludgate  and Fleet Street.\"    We will conclude this with some more extracts from the evidence of  Pepys. On the next Sunday, when it is interesting to observe the  drought came to an end, he attended service twice, probably at St.  Olave's, Hart Street, Mark Lane, in the neighbourhood of Crutched  Friars. In the morning \"Our parson made a melancholy but good sermon;  and many and most in the church cried, specially the women. The  church mighty full; but few of fashion, and most strangers. To church  again, and there preached Dean Harding [Nicolas Hardy, of Rochester];  but methinks a bad, poor sermon, though proper for the time; nor  eloquent in saying at this time that the City is reduced from a large  folio to a decimo-tertio.\" The phrase \"most strangers\" is not  surprising, as besides St. Paul's, some eighty-five parish churches  were in ashes, including two without the walls but inside the  Liberties. Our last extract is under date 12th November following, and  illustrates how such remains as had hitherto escaped desecration were  treated in the general disorder. Bishop Braybroke's efforts at reform  have been already acknowledged: his tomb was behind the high altar  towards the east. \"In the Convocation House Yard [apparently the space  within the Chapter House Cloisters] did there see the body of Robert  Braybroke, Bishop of London, that died in 1404. He fell down in the  tomb out of the great church into St. Fayth's this late fire, and is  here seen his skeleton with the flesh on; but all tough and dry like a  spongy dry leather or touchwood, all upon his bones. His head turned  aside. A great man in his time, and Lord Chancellor. And now exposed  to be handled and derided by some, though admired for its duration by  others. Many flocking to see it.\"    Old St. Paul's, then, suffered the fate of its predecessors in the  first week of September, 1666. By the Friday the conflagration had so  far exhausted itself that Pepys was able to walk from Paul's Wharf to  the churchyard. The City within the Walls was well-nigh burnt out, and  of the eighty-three parish churches consumed only forty-eight were  rebuilt; and these with the thirteen untouched left accommodation more  than sufficient for the surrounding population. Our regret for the  cathedral would have been greater, had this magnificent monument of  mediaeval genius--probably of its kind as fine as any in the  world--been capable of a conservative restoration: it is to be feared  that neglect, the destroyer, and the restorer had amongst them  rendered this task well-nigh impossible.    So far as existing authorities guide us, it remains to describe the"]]]
