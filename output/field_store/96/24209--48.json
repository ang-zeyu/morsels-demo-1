In the sheep-dog's case, a healthy appetite  waited always upon plentiful meals. She had but one whelp to care  for, and of that one she hardly ever lost sight, even when  sleeping. If the blind, foolish Finn wriggled from her side in mid-most  night, he ran no risk of taking cold, for if the sheep-dog did  not see him, then her instinct (keener in the plebeian than in the  dog of high degree, just as nerves and sentiment are keener in the  aristocrat) woke her within the minute, and up she got to nose her  erring infant back to sleep and warmth and safety.    On the evening of his tenth day in the world, Finn was still  perfectly blind. His eyes as yet showed no signs of opening. This  rather surprised the Master, when he looked in before shutting up  for the night. He was quite easy in his mind now about Tara, who  was almost well again, to all appearances, and lay contentedly in  the den all day, having apparently forgotten, not only her illness,  but its causes, and her puppies. She was rather listless and  lackadaisical, but seemed to be well content so that she could lie  within sight of the Master and dream. And now the Master was  chatting with the sheep-dog foster, after having had a good look at  Finn, and before shutting up for the night.    \"But perhaps it is well he is still blind, for your sake, old  lady,\" said he to the foster. \"He will be a bit of a handful for  you before you've done with him, I fancy; and the sooner he begins  to find his own way about, the longer he will torment you. Never  mind, little bitch; you must do your best for Finn; for he's a  great pup.\"    And a great pup he assuredly was, to be sprawling across that  little sheep-dog's sandy flank. He covered pretty nearly as much  space as a whole litter of her own kind would have occupied. His  pink pads looked monstrous now; his timbers were quite twice the  thickness you would have expected to find them; and his shapeless,  abundantly nourished body was very nearly as broad at the haunch as  it was long from neck to tail. His flat, black nose was remarkably  broad, in spite of the unusual length of the black-marked muzzle,  and the Master, who had studied Wolfhound puppies very closely,  seemed particularly pleased about this. Finn's corners, so to say,  were practically black. His body, as a whole, was of a steely,  brindle grey, but the centre of the back of his tail and its tip  were almost black, and so were his little podgy hocks, knees,  muzzle, brows (if he could be said to have any) and the hair over  his gristly shoulder bones. The Master swung his hurricane lamp  high for a last look at Finn and the foster.    \"You certainly are a marvel of size, my son; but I wonder you don't  begin to open those eyes of yours, I must say. Let's hope they're  very dark. Good-night, little shepherd!\"    The light of Finn's twelfth day on earth had already filled the  coach-house through its back windows when the sheep-dog stirred  next morning and yawned. The slight sound and movement woke Finn,  and automatically he burrowed vigorously after his breakfast  without an instant's hesitation. Presently he emerged with milky  nose from the foster's flanks, and meandered forth to be licked and  made comfortable. The licking ended, the foster rose, and stepped  off the bed to stretch her limbs. Finn rolled rollickingly over on  his back, and then staggered up and on to his absurdly large and  spreading feet. Then he backed sideways among the straw, like a  crab. Then he tried to rub one eye with one of his mushroom-like  fore-feet, and, failing abjectly in that, fell plump on his nose.  Staggering to his feet again, Finn turned his face once toward the  broad sunbeam that divided the coach-house in two parts from the  side window; and then, as though tried beyond endurance, opened  wide his jaws and bleated forth his fright and distress to the  world, so that the patient little foster-mother was obliged to cut  her constitutional short, and hop back to bed, lolling a solicitous  tongue and making queer comforting noises in her throat.    But for some several minutes the puppy absolutely refused to be  comforted; and when the Master came in an hour or so later he  understood at a glance what Finn's trouble was, though the casual  observer might well have thought there was no particular change in  his circumstances. The fact was Finn had sustained a real shock,  and his perturbation about it lasted for nearly half an hour, after  which it retired, overcome by youthful curiosity. Finn had suddenly  awakened to the fact that he was no longer blind; he had stepped,  at one uncertain stride, into a seeing life. It was like being born  again, and that with faculties matured and sharpened by nearly a  fortnight's life in the world. It really was no trifling adventure  for Finn, this discovery of a new and very wonderful sense, which  had come simply with the parting of the lids that covered his  black-brown eyes.    He spent practically the whole of that day testing this new sense  which had come to him with so great a shock. For instance, he found  that if he crawled a certain distance from the foster in one  direction, the air before him became whiter and whiter, until at  last he stubbed his toes and his nose against it. And that was his  first acquaintance with walls. Then, when he crawled in another  direction, he came presently to a ledge several inches in height,  and when, as the result of really herculean efforts, he had raised  his fat body upon that ledge, the floor beyond jumped up and hit  him very hard, and left him helpless as a turtle on its back, till  the foster came and lifted him back to bed in her jaws. That was  how he learned that it was not wise for very small pups to climb  over the edges of beds. Towards evening, when many useful lessons  had been learned, and the pup was beginning to swagger over the  advantage given him by his new-found sense, in the matter of  picking and choosing feeding-places, and demanding his foster-mother's  attention by planting one foot on her eye, and so forth,  Finn came to the conclusion that this new power he had was, upon  the whole, a remarkably fine thing, and a jolly gift, even if it  did keep one awake, and lead to considerable exhaustion, and---- And  then he shut up his little black-brown eyes, and, well  sheltered by the foster's right hind-leg and tail, went fast asleep  and dreamed of warm milk.    From this point onward, Finn's progress was rapid. Whereas till now  he had seemed little more than an appendage of the sheep-dog  foster-mother, he now rapidly developed a personality, and a very  masterful one, of his own. His eyes, which were quite as dark as  the Master had desired them to be, were idle only when he slept;  and the same might have been said of every part of him. He  grovelled most industriously during all his waking hours, until  such time as his podgy legs had hardened sufficiently to bear his  weight--with many falls, of course--and then he began to scurry  about on his feet. His usual style of progression at this period  was to take from two to four abrupt, jerky strides, rather with the  air of a fussy and corpulent old gentleman who had to catch a  train, and then to subside in a confused lump, on chest and nose,  with tail waggling angrily in mid-air. This was not so annoying to  the grey pup as one might suppose, because, though generally in a  hurry, he always forgot his intended destination by the time he had  taken three steps towards it, and therefore a sudden halt at the  fourth seemed reasonable enough, and quite an agreeable diversion.    During the third week of his life, the weather being very fine,  Finn, with the other pups, was treated to long sun-baths in a  little fenced-in square of gravel which was covered with deodorized  sawdust. These sun-baths were extremely good for the pups, and  provided pleasant periods of rest and relaxation for the foster-mothers,  who, though never allowed to see each other, were each  within smelling distance of the pups, one upon one side and one on  the other.    A huge dry bullock's shin-bone was put into the sun-bath, on a  piece of matting, and this was a source of great interest to the  pups, whose little white teeth were now as sharp as needles; a fact  known only too well to their respective foster-mothers. Finn's  favourite amusement was to lie straddled along this bone, and defy  the other pups to touch it. He would give hard-breathing little  snorts which he meant for growls, when one of the other pups began  to nuzzle the bone; and, at times, these snorts would be vehement  enough to make him lose his balance and roll helplessly off the  bone on to the ground. Then the other three pups would straddle  across his tubby body and snort defiance at him, each with a paw  planted victoriously in his protuberant stomach or on his broad  chest.    On Finn's twenty-first morning he spent the better part of half an  hour in the lap of the Mistress of the Kennels, learning to lap  warm milk and water. First of all he learned to suck the milky tip  of the Mistress's little finger. Then, gradually, his nose was made  to follow the little finger-tip into the milk; and, one way and  another, he consumed during that first lesson about a tablespoonful  of milk. In the afternoon he was kept for perhaps two and a half  hours from the foster-mother, and then he, with the other pups,  made great progress in the art of lapping; though they were all  glad to approach the feeding question in a more serious and  practical manner on being returned to their foster-mothers. Still,  they had learned something, and the succeeding lessons of each  following day brought quick familiarity and facility. In fact, the  trouble with Finn, after two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#8)"],[1,"are Leonin and Perotin, both organists of  Notre Dame at Paris.]    [Footnote 34: Although this is not the place to set forth all the  details of this development, in the interest of historical justice we  should not think of Bach without gratefully acknowledging the  remarkable work of such pioneers as the Dutchman, Sweelinck  (1562-1621), organist at Amsterdam; the Italian, Frescobaldi  (1583-1644), organist at Rome, and--greatest of all, in his  stimulating influence upon Bach--the Dane, Buxtehude (1636-1707),  organist at Luebeck. Sweelinck and Frescobaldi may fairly be called the  founders of the genuine Fugue, and there is a romantic warmth in  Buxtehude's best work which makes it thoroughly modern in sentiment.]    [Footnote 35: In connection with the statement that music has  developed according to natural law, it is worth noting that the  four-part chorus early became the standard for both vocal and  instrumental groups for the simple reason that there exist two kinds  of women's voices--soprano and alto, and two of men's voices--tenor  and bass. Originally, the chief voice in the ecclesiastical chorus was  the tenor (teneo), because the tenors _sustained_ the melody. Below  them were the basses (bassus, low); above the tenors came the altos  (altus, high) and still higher the sopranos (sopra, above).]    In the latter example it is evident that there is an interweaving of  _three_ distinct melodic lines.    The polyphonic instrumental works of Bach and his contemporaries were  called by such names as Preludes, Fugues, Canons, Inventions, Toccatas  and Fantasies; but since a complete account of all these forms would  lead too far afield, we shall confine ourselves to a description of  the Canon, the Invention and the Fugue. A Canon (from the Greek  [Greek: Kanon], meaning a strict rule or law) is a composition in  which there is a _literal_ systematic imitation, carried out to the  end, between two or more of the voices (often with subsidiary voices  filling in), and may be considered a kind of musical dialogue in which  the second, or answering, part reenforces the message previously  uttered by the leading voice. This imitation may take place at any  degree of separation; and Canons are in existence at the interval of  the second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. The most effective Canons,  however, are those in which the answering voice is an octave away from  the leading one. Although the Canon is not a form employed frequently  by modern composers for an entire composition, Canonic imitation  appears so often in all large works for orchestra, string quartet or  ensemble combinations, that the music-lover should acquire a certain  ease in listening to a structure of this type. The Canon, moreover, is  an integral factor in the style of Cesar Franck, d'Indy and Brahms;  and illustrations of its use abound in their works. The organ is  particularly well suited to the rendition of Canons; since, by its  facilities for tone-color, the two voices may be clearly contrasted.  Those interested in organ literature should become acquainted with the  following excellent examples: The _Canon in B-flat major_, op. 40, by  Guilmant; the 4th movement of the _Fifth Organ Symphony_ by Widor; the  Canon in B minor, op. 54, by Schumann; the _Canon in F-sharp major_,  op. 30, by Merkel, and the set of _Ten Canonic studies_, op. 12, by  G.W. Chadwick. In other fields of composition the following should be  cited: The set of _Pianoforte Pieces in Canon form_, op. 35, by  Jadassohn; a like set by Rheinberger, op. 180; the _Canonic Vocal  Trios_, op. 156, by Reinecke and the famous Canon from the first act  of Beethoven's opera _Fidelio_. There is also a beautiful bit of  Canonic imitation between two of the upper voices in the introduction  of Berlioz's _Carnaval Romain Overture_ for orchestra. One of the most  appealing Canons in modern literature is the setting for soprano and  barytone, by Henschel, of the poem _Oh that we two were Maying_ by  Charles Kingsley. This example alone would sufficiently corroborate  the statement that the firmness of structure inherent in the canonic  form is perfectly compatible with genuine freedom and poetry of  inspiration. In the first movement of Cesar Frank's _Symphony in D  minor_, at the recapitulation (page 39 of the full score) may be found  a magnificent example of the intensity of effect gained by a canonic  imitation of the main theme--in this instance between the lower and  upper voices. Possibly the finest example of canonic writing in all  literature is the Finale of Cesar Franck's _Sonata in A major_ for  Violin and Pianoforte in which, for several pages, there is an  eloquent dialogue between the two contrasting instruments. The  movement is too long for citation but it should certainly be procured  and studied. In the Trio of the Scherzo in Beethoven's _Seventh Sonata  for Violin and Pianoforte_ there is a free use of canonic imitation  which will repay investigation. Lastly, the _Aria with 30  Variations_--the so-called _Goldberg Variations_ of Bach--is a perfect  storehouse of every conceivable canonic device.    A few standard examples are to be found in the Supplement. These  should be played over and studied until they are thoroughly  familiar--not only for the pleasure to be derived, but for the  indispensable training afforded in polyphonic listening.    Ex. No. 9 Canon by Thomas Tallys (1510-1585).    Ex. No. 10 Canonic Variation by Schumann from the _Etudes  Symphoniques_.    Ex. No. 11 of Bach's _Goldberg Variations_.    Ex. No. 12 Canon in B-flat minor, op. 38, Grieg.    Ex. No. 13 Canon in F-sharp major, op. 35, Jadassohn.    One of the most simple and direct types of polyphonic composition is  the form known as the _Invention_ in which, as the term implies, the  composer--through his _inventive genius_ and by means of the  polyphonic devices of imitation and transposition--develops to a  logical conclusion some short and characteristic motive. We are  fortunate in having from Bach himself, that consummate master of  polyphony, two sets of such Inventions: fifteen for two voices, and  fifteen for three. These flights of fancy--in which art so subtly  conceals art--though originally composed for the clavichord and  harpsichord (the precursors of the pianoforte), are very effective on  our modern instrument and should be in the possession of every  music-student.[36] A brief analysis is now given of the first one in  the set for two voices, and Nos. 4, 8 and 10 in this set are  particularly recommended for study; also Nos. 2, 6 and 14 among those  for three voices. The opening motive    [Music]    is the foundation of the entire composition and is at once imitated,  canonically, in the lower voice. Then the two voices play about, with  figures clearly derived from the motive, until we reach, in measures  three and four, a systematic downward transposition of the material.  Such transpositions or shiftings up or down in pitch are called  _Sequences_. They are very frequent in all polyphonic composition,  give a strong sense of unity to melodic progression and are generally  carried out in groups of three, _i.e._, the original figure and two  repetitions. After the sequence the music naturally works toward the  most nearly related key (the dominant) and in the seventh measure  reaches in that key its first objective. These Inventions of Bach, as  well as the Dance forms soon to be studied, are almost invariably in  what is known as _Two-part_ form, _i.e._, the music consists of two  main divisions, clearly marked off by cadences[37]; the first of which  modulates to the dominant or some related key while the second part,  starting in this key, works back to a final close in the home key. In  Inventions it early became customary in the second part to begin with  the same motive as the first--but in the _opposite_ voice. Thus we  see, in the Invention now being discussed, that the seventh measure  begins with the original motive in the bass which, in turn, is  imitated by the Soprano--a process just the reverse of that in the  opening measures.    [Footnote 36: The best edition is that by Busoni, published by  Breitkopf and Haertel.]    [Footnote 37: This technical term as well as others will later be more  fully explained.]    [Music]    In pieces in this Two-part form the second portion is generally longer  than the first; for the composer, by the time he has reached this  second part, may consider the material sufficiently familiar to be  expanded and varied by excursions into more remote keys, and by more  intricate manipulations of the chief motive. In measure 11 we find a  modulation to D minor and then, after some free treatment of the  motive, we reach--in measure 15--a cadence in A minor. A long  sequential passage brings us, through a modulation to the subdominant  key of F major (in measures 18 and 19), to a strong closing cadence in  the home key. It should be noticed that in this Invention and in some  of the dance forms there is shown a strong leaning towards a  tripartite division of the material as is indicated by the _three_  cadences in measures 7, 15 and 22. Since, however, the middle part is  lacking in any strong _contrast_--which is such an essential factor in  the fully developed three-part form--it seems better to consider this  piece, and others like it, as a tendency rather than as a complete  embodiment of tripartite arrangement. It is expected that the music  lover will take these Inventions for what they really are and not  search in them for those notes of intense subjectivity and dramatic  power so prevalent in modern music. They are merely little pieces--a  \"tour de force\" in polyphonic ingenuity; music rejoicing in its own  inherent vitality. Accepted in this spirit they are invigorating and  charming.    The form in which polyphonic skill reaches its highest possibilities  is the Fugue; and the immortal examples of this form are"]]]
