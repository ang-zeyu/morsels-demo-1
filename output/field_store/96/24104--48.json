Though the ladies of France are not very handsome, they are sensible and  witty. To many of them, without the least flattery, may be applied the  distich which Sappho ascribes to herself:    \"_If partial nature has denied me beauty, the charms of my mind amply  make up for the deficiency._\"    No women upon earth can excel, and few rival them, in their almost  native arts of pleasing all who approach them. Add to this, an education  beyond that of most European ladies, a consummate skill in those  accomplishments that suit the fair sex, and the most graceful manner of  displaying that knowledge to the utmost advantage.    Such is the description that may safely be given of the French ladies in  general. But the spirit, or rather the _evil genius_ of gallantry, too  often perverts all these lovely qualities, and renders them subservient  to very iniquitous ends.    In every country, women have always a little to do, and a great deal to  say. In France, they dictate almost every thing that is said, and direct  every thing that is done. They are the most restless beings in the  world. To fold her hands in idleness, and impose silence on her tongue,  would be to a French woman worse than death. The sole joy of her life is  to be engaged in the prosecution of some scheme, relating either to  fashion, ambition, or love.    Among the rich and opulent, they are entirely the votaries of pleasure,  which they pursue through all its labyrinths, at the expense of fortune,  reputation, and health. Giddy and extravagant to the last degree, they  leave to their husbands economy and care, which would only spoil their  complexions, and furrow their brows.    When we descend to tradesmen and mechanics, the case is reversed: the  wife manages every thing in the house and shop, while the husband  lounges in the back-shop an idle spectator, or struts about with his  sword and bag-wig.    Matrimony among the French, seems to be a bargain entered into by a male  and female, to bear the same name, live in the same house, and pursue  their separate pleasures without restraint or control. And, so  religiously is this part of the bargain kept, that both parties shape  their course exactly as convenience and inclination dictate.    The French girls are kept under very strict superintendence. They are  not allowed to go to parties, or places of public amusement, without  being accompanied by some married female relation; and they see their  lovers only in the presence of a third person. Marriages are entirely  negotiated by parents; and sometimes the wedding day is the second time  that a bride and bridegroom see each other. Nothing is more common than  to visit a lady, and attend her parties, without knowing her husband by  sight; or to visit a gentleman without ever being introduced to his  wife. If a married couple were to be seen frequently in each other's  company, they would be deemed extremely ungenteel. After ladies are  married, they have unbounded freedom. It is a common practice to receive  morning calls from gentlemen, before they have risen from bed; and they  talk with as little reserve to such visiters, as they would in the  presence of any woman of refinement.    In no country does real politeness shew itself more than in France,  where the company of the women is accessible to every man who can  recommend himself by his dress, and by his address. To affectation and  prudery the French women are equally strangers. Easy and unaffected in  their manners, their politeness has so much the appearance of nature,  that one would almost believe no part of it to be the effect of art. An  air of sprightliness and gaiety sits perpetually on their countenances,  and their whole deportment seems to indicate that their only business is  to \"strew the path of life with flowers.\" Persuasion hangs on their  lips; and, though their volubility of tongue is indefatigable, so soft  is their accent, so lively their expression, so various their attitudes,  that they fix the attention for hours together on a tale of nothing.    The Jewish doctors have a fable concerning the etymology of the word  Eve, which one would almost be tempted to say is realized in the French  women. \"Eve,\" say they, \"comes from a word, which signifies to talk; and  she was so called, because, soon after the creation, there fell from  heaven twelve baskets full of chit chat, and she picked up _nine_ of  them, while her husband was gathering the other _three_.\"    French ladies, especially those not young, use a great deal of rouge. A  traveller who saw many of them in their opera boxes, says, \"I could  compare them to nothing but a large bed of pionies.\"    After the French revolution, it became the fashion to have everything in  ancient classic style. Loose flowing drapery, naked arms, sandaled feet,  and tresses twisted, were the order of the day.    The state of gross immorality that prevailed at this time ought not to  be described, if language had the power. The profligacy of Rome in its  worst days was comparatively thrown into the shade. Religion and  marriage became a mockery, and every form of impure and vindictive  passion walked abroad, with the consciousness that public opinion did  not require them to assume even a slight disguise. The fish-women of  Paris will long retain an unenviable celebrity for the brutal excess of  their rage. The goddess of Reason was worshipped by men, under the form  of a living woman entirely devoid of clothing; and in the public streets  ladies might be seen who scarcely paid more attention to decorum.      ITALIAN WOMEN.    Dr Goldsmith thus characterises the Italians in general:        \"Could nature's bounty satisfy the breast,    The sons of Italy were surely blest.    Whatever fruits in different climes are found,    That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground;    Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,    Whose bright succession decks the varied year:    Whatever sweets salute the northern sky,    With vernal leaves that blossom but to die:    These here disporting, own the kindred soil,    Nor ask luxuriance from their planter's toil;    While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand,    To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.        \"But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,    And sensual bliss is all the nation knows.    In florid beauty groves and fields appear,    Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.    Contrasted faults thro' all his manners rein;    Though poor, luxurious; though submissive, vain;    Though grave, yet trifling; zealous, yet untrue;    And e'en in penance planning sins anew.    All evils here contaminate the mind,    That opulence departed leaves behind:    For wealth was theirs, not far remov'd the date,    When commerce proudly flourish'd thro' the state;    At her command the palace learn'd to rise,    Again the long fall'n column sought the skies;    The canvass glow'd, beyond e'en nature warm;    The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form.    Till, more unsteady then the southern gale,    Commerce on other shores display'd her sail;    While naught remain'd of all that riches gave,    But towns unmann'd, and lords without a slave;    And late the nation found, with fruitless skill,    Its former strength was but plethoric ill.        \"Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied    By arts, the splendid wrecks of former pride;    From them the feeble heart and long fall'n mind    An easy compensation seem to find.    Here may be seen in bloodless pomp array'd,    The pasteboard triumph, and the cavalcade;    Processions form'd from piety and love,    A mistress or a saint in every grove.\"    Almost every traveller who has visited Italy, agrees in describing it as  the most abandoned of all the countries of Europe. At Venice, at Naples,  and indeed in almost every port of Italy, women are taught from their  infancy the various arts of alluring to their arms the young and unwary,  and of obtaining from them, while heated by love or wine, every thing  that flattery and false smiles can obtain, in these unguarded moments.    The Italians, like their neighbors of Spain and Portugal, live under the  paralyzing influence of a religion that retains its superstitious forms,  while little of life-giving faith remains. Like them they have lively  passions, are extremely susceptible, and in the general conduct of life  more governed by the impetuosity of impulse than rectitude of principle.  The ladies have less gravity than the Spanish, and less frivolity than  the French, and in their style of dress incline towards the freedom of  the latter. Some of the richest and most commodious convents of Europe  are in Italy. The daughters of wealthy families are generally bestowed  in marriage as soon as they leave these places of education. These  matters are entirely arranged by parents and guardians, and youth and  age are not unfrequently joined together, for the sake of uniting  certain acres of land. But the affections, thus repressed, seek their  natural level by indirect courses. It is a rare thing for an Italian  lady to be without her _cavaliere servente_, or lover, who spends much  of his time at her house, attends her to all public places, and appears  to live upon her smiles. The old maxim of the Provencal troubadours,  that matrimony ought to be no hindrance to such _liaisons_, seems to be  generally and practically believed in Italy.    In Genoa, there are marriage-brokers, who have pocketbooks filled with  the names of marriageable girls of different classes, with an account of  their fortunes, personal attractions, &c. When they succeed in  arranging connections, they have two or three per cent. commission on  the portion. The marriage-contract is often drawn up before the parties  have seen each other.

Grafton  had determined to fly to France and to throw himself at the feet of his  uncle. With such rumours as these all the coffeehouses of London were  filled during the latter part of February. So intense was the public  anxiety that, if any man of rank was missed, two days running, at his  usual haunts, it was immediately whispered that he had stolen away to  Saint Germains. [34]    The second of March arrived; and the event quieted the fears of one  party, and confounded the hopes of the other. The Primate indeed and  several of his suffragans stood obstinately aloof: but three Bishops and  seventy-three temporal peers took the oaths. At the next meeting of the  Upper House several more prelates came in. Within a week about a hundred  Lords had qualified themselves to sit. Others, who were prevented by  illness from appearing, sent excuses and professions of attachment  to their Majesties. Grafton refuted all the stories which had been  circulated about him by coming to be sworn on the first day. Two members  of the Ecclesiastical Commission, Mulgrave and Sprat, hastened to make  atonement for their fault by plighting their faith to William. Beaufort,  who had long been considered as the type of a royalist of the old  school, submitted after a very short hesitation. Aylesbury and  Dartmouth, though vehement Jacobites, had as little scruple about taking  the oath of allegiance as they afterwards had about breaking it. [35]  The Hydes took different paths. Rochester complied with the law; but  Clarendon proved refractory. Many thought it strange that the brother  who had adhered to James till James absconded should be less sturdy than  the brother who had been in the Dutch camp. The explanation perhaps  is that Rochester would have sacrificed much more than Clarendon by  refusing to take the oaths. Clarendon's income did not depend on the  pleasure of the Government but Rochester had a pension of four thousand  a year, which he could not hope to retain if he refused to acknowledge  the new Sovereigns. Indeed, he had so many enemies that, during some  months, it seemed doubtful whether he would, on any terms, be suffered  to retain the splendid reward which he had earned by persecuting the  Whigs and by sitting in the High Commission. He was saved from what  would have been a fatal blow to his fortunes by the intercession of  Burnet, who had been deeply injured by him, and who revenged himself as  became a Christian divine. [36]    In the Lower House four hundred members were sworn in on the second  of March; and among them was Seymour. The spirit of the Jacobites was  broken by his defection; and the minority with very few exceptions  followed his example. [37]    Before the day fixed for the taking of the oaths, the Commons had begun  to discuss a momentous question which admitted of no delay. During the  interregnum, William had, as provisional chief of the administration,  collected the taxes and applied them to the public service; nor could  the propriety of this course be questioned by any person who approved  of the Revolution. But the Revolution was now over: the vacancy of the  throne had been supplied: the Houses were sitting: the law was in full  force; and it became necessary immediately to decide to what revenue the  Government was entitled.    Nobody denied that all the lands and hereditaments of the Crown had  passed with the Crown to the new Sovereigns. Nobody denied that all  duties which had been granted to the Crown for a fixed term of years  might be constitutionally exacted till that term should expire. But  large revenues had been settled by Parliament on James for life; and  whether what had been settled on James for life could, while he lived,  be claimed by William and Mary, was a question about which opinions were  divided.    Holt, Treby, Pollexfen, indeed all the eminent Whig lawyers, Somers  excepted, held that these revenues had been granted to the late King, in  his political capacity, but for his natural life, and ought therefore,  as long as he continued to drag on his existence in a strange land,  to be paid to William and Mary. It appears from a very concise and  unconnected report of the debate that Somers dissented from this  doctrine. His opinion was that, if the Act of Parliament which had  imposed the duties in question was to be construed according to the  spirit, the word life must be understood to mean reign, and that  therefore the term for which the grant had been made had expired. This  was surely the sound opinion: for it was plainly irrational to treat the  interest of James in this grant as at once a thing annexed to his  person and a thing annexed to his office; to say in one breath that the  merchants of London and Bristol must pay money because he was naturally  alive, and that his successors must receive that money because he was  politically defunct. The House was decidedly with Somers. The members  generally were bent on effecting a great reform, without which it was  felt that the Declaration of Rights would be but an imperfect guarantee  for public liberty. During the conflict which fifteen successive  Parliaments had maintained against four successive Kings, the chief  weapon of the Commons had been the power of the purse; and never had  the representatives of the people been induced to surrender that weapon  without having speedy cause to repent of their too credulous loyalty.  In that season of tumultuous joy which followed the Restoration, a large  revenue for life had been almost by acclamation granted to Charles the  Second. A few months later there was scarcely a respectable Cavalier in  the kingdom who did not own that the stewards of the nation would have  acted more wisely if they had kept in their hands the means of checking  the abuses which disgraced every department of the government. James  the Second had obtained from his submissive Parliament, without a  dissentient voice, an income sufficient to defray the ordinary expenses  of the state during his life; and, before he had enjoyed that income  half a year, the great majority of those who had dealt thus liberally  with him blamed themselves severely for their liberality. If experience  was to be trusted, a long and painful experience, there could be no  effectual security against maladministration, unless the Sovereign were  under the necessity of recurring frequently to his Great Council for  pecuniary aid. Almost all honest and enlightened men were therefore  agreed in thinking that a part at least of the supplies ought to be  granted only for short terms. And what time could be fitter for the  introduction of this new practice than the year 1689, the commencement  of a new reign, of a new dynasty, of a new era of constitutional  government? The feeling on this subject was so strong and general that  the dissentient minority gave way. No formal resolution was passed; but  the House proceeded to act on the supposition that the grants which had  been made to James for life had been annulled by his abdication. [38]    It was impossible to make a new settlement of the revenue without  inquiry and deliberation. The Exchequer was ordered to furnish such  returns as might enable the House to form estimates of the public  expenditure and income. In the meantime, liberal provision was made  for the immediate exigencies of the state. An extraordinary aid, to be  raised by direct monthly assessment, was voted to the King. An Act was  passed indemnifying all who had, since his landing, collected by his  authority the duties settled on James; and those duties which had  expired were continued for some months.    Along William's whole line of march, from Torbay to London, he had been  importuned by the common people to relieve them from the intolerable  burden of the hearth money. In truth, that tax seems to have united all  the worst evils which can be imputed to any tax. It was unequal, and  unequal in the most pernicious way: for it pressed heavily on the poor,  and lightly on the rich. A peasant, all whose property was not worth  twenty pounds, was charged ten shillings. The Duke of Ormond, or the  Duke of Newcastle, whose estates were worth half a million, paid only  four or five pounds. The collectors were empowered to examine the  interior of every house in the realm, to disturb families at meals,  to force the doors of bedrooms, and, if the sum demanded were not  punctually paid, to sell the trencher on which the barley loaf was  divided among the poor children, and the pillow from under the head  of the lying-in woman. Nor could the Treasury effectually restrain the  chimneyman from using his powers with harshness: for the tax was farmed;  and the government was consequently forced to connive at outrages and  exactions such as have, in every age made the name of publican a proverb  for all that is most hateful.    William had been so much moved by what he had heard of these grievances  that, at one of the earliest sittings of the Privy Council, he  introduced the subject. He sent a message requesting the House of  Commons to consider whether better regulations would effectually prevent  the abuses which had excited so much discontent. He added that he would  willingly consent to the entire abolition of the tax if it should appear  that the tax and the abuses were inseparable. [39] This communication  was received with loud applause. There were indeed some financiers of  the old school who muttered that tenderness for the poor was a fine  thing; but that no part of the revenue of the state came in so exactly  to the day as the hearth money; that the goldsmiths of the City could  not always be induced to lend on the security of the next quarter's  customs or excise, but that on an assignment of hearth money there was  no difficulty in obtaining advances. In the House of Commons, those who  thought thus did not venture to raise their voices in"]]]
