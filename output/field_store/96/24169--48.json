It would be  powerfully hard for me to say which was happier, \"Danyul\" or his  mother. They just beamed upon each other. She was proud of her boy and  his pleasant home. \"Danyul says he's got a little red heifer for me  and he's got ten cows of his own. Now ain't that fine? It is a pity we  can't have a few apple trees,--a little orchard. We'd live like  kings, we would that.\" We explained to her how we got our fruit by  parcel post, and Danyul said he would order his winter supply of  apples at once.    As soon as dinner was over, Danyul had to mend a fence so as to keep  his cattle in their own pasture. Mr. Stewart went to help and we women  were left alone. We improved the time well. Mrs. Holt would not lie  down and rest, as we tried to persuade her to, but hobbled about,  admiring everything. She was delighted with the big, clean cellar  and its orderly bins, in which Danyul was beginning to store his  vegetables. She was as pleased as a child with her room, and almost  wept when we told her which were \"welcoming presents\" from us. She was  particularly delighted with her red flower, and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  will be happy for days remembering it was she who gave it. I shall be  happy longer than that remembering how tickled she was with her  bonnets.    She wanted to wipe the dishes, so she and I did up the dishes while  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Elizabeth put some finishing stitches in on  their aprons. She sat on the highest seat we could find, and as she  deftly handled the dishes she told us this:--    \"I should think you would wonder why Danyul ain't got me out of the  porehouse before now. I've been there more 'n ten years, but Danyul  didn't know it till a month ago. Charlotte Nash wrote him. Neither  Danyul nor me are any master-hand at writin', and then I didn't want  him to know anyhow. When Danyul got into trouble, I signed over the  little farm his pa left us, to pay the lawyer person to defend him.  Danyul had enough trouble, so he went to the penitentiary without  finding out I was homeless. I should think you would be put out to  know Danyul has been to the pen, but he has. He always said to me that  he never done what he was accused of, so I am not going to tell you  what it was. Danyul was always a good boy, honest and good to me and  a hard worker. I ain't got no call to doubt him when he says he's  innocent.    \"Well, I fought his case the best I could, but he got ten years. Then  the lawyer person claimed the home an' all, so I went out to work, but  bein' crippled I found it hard. When Danyul had been gone four years I  had saved enough to buy my brown alapacky and go to see him. He looked  pale and sad,--afraid even to speak to his own mother. I went back to  work as broke up as Danyul, and that winter I come down with such a  long spell of sickness that they sent me to the pore farm. I always  wrote to Danyul on his birthday and I couldn't bear to let him know  where I was.    \"Soon's his time was out, he come here; he couldn't bear the scorn  that he'd get at home, so he come out to this big, free West, and took  the chance it offers. Once he wrote and asked me if I would like to  live West. He said if I did, after he got a start I must sell out and  come to him. Bless his heart, all that time I was going to my meals  just when I was told to and eatin' just what I was helped to, going to  bed and getting up at some one else's word! Oh, it was bitter, but I  didn't want Danyul to taste it; so, when I didn't come, he thought I  didn't want to give up the old home, and didn't say no more about it.  Charlotte was on the pore farm too, until her cousin died and she got  left a home and enough to live on. Sometimes she would come out to the  farm and take me back with her for a little visit. She was good that  way. I never would tell her about Danyul; but this summer I was  helpin' her dry apples and somehow she jist coaxed the secret out. She  wrote to Danyul, and he wrote to me, and here I am. Danyul and me are  so happy that we are goin' to send a ticket back to the farm for  Maggie Harper. She ain't got no home and will be glad to help me and  get a rale home.\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Elizabeth debated what more was needed to make  the kitchen a bit more homey. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy said a red cushion  for the rocker, and Elizabeth said a white cat to lie on the hearth.  Mrs. Holt said, \"Yes, I _do_ need 'em both,--only it must be an old  stray tabby cat. This house is going to be the shelter of the  homeless.\"    Well, I can't tell you any more about the Holts because we left next  morning. Danyul came across the bridge to bid us good-bye. He said he  could never thank us enough, but it is we who should be and are  thankful. We got a little glow of happiness from their great blaze. We  are all so glad to know that everything is secure and bright for the  Holts in the future.    That stop is the cause of my missing two letters to you, but this  letter is as long as half a dozen letters should be. You know I never  could get along with few words. I'll try to do better next time. But I  can't imagine how I shall get the letters mailed. We are miles and  miles and miles away in the mountains; it is two days' ride to a  post-office, so maybe I will not get letters to you as often as I  planned.                             Sincerely yours,                                ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          VI    ELIZABETH'S ROMANCE                                    CAMP CLOUDCREST,                                     September 12, 1914.    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    I find I can't write to you as often as I at first intended; but I've  a chance to-day, so I will not let it pass unused. We are in the last  camp, right on the hunting ground, in the \"midst of the fray.\" We have  said good-bye to dear Elizabeth, and I must tell you about her because  she really comes first.    To begin with, the morning we left the Holts, Elizabeth suggested that  we three women ride in the buckboard, so I seated myself on a roll of  bedding in the back part. At first none of us talked; we just absorbed  the wonderful green-gold beauty of the morning. The sky was clear  blue, with a few fleecy clouds drifting lazily past. The mountains on  one side were crested; great crags and piles of rock crowned them as  far as we could see; timber grew only about halfway up. The trunks of  the quaking aspens shone silvery in the early sunlight, and their  leaves were shimmering gold. And the stately pines kept whispering and  murmuring; it almost seemed as if they were chiding the quaking aspens  for being frivolous. On the other side of the road lay the river,  bordered by willows and grassy flats. There were many small lakes, and  the ducks and geese were noisily enjoying themselves among the rushes  and water-grasses. Beyond the river rose the forest-covered mountains,  hill upon hill.    Elizabeth dressed with especial care that morning, and very pretty she  looked in her neat shepherd's plaid suit and natty little white canvas  hat. Very soon she said, \"I hope neither of you will misunderstand me  when I tell you that if my hopes are realized I will not ride with you  much longer. I never saw such a country as the West,--it is so big  and so beautiful,--and I never saw such people. You are just like your  country; you have fed me, cared for me, and befriended me, a stranger,  and never asked me a word.\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy said, \"Tut, tut, 'tis nothing at all we've done.  'Tis a comfort you've been, hasn't she, Mrs. Stewart?\"    I could heartily agree; and Elizabeth went on, \"The way I have been  received and the way we all treated Mrs. Holt will be the greatest  help to me in becoming what I hope to become, a real Westerner. I  might have lived a long time in the West and not have understood many  things if I had not fallen into your hands. Years ago, before I was  through school, I was to have been married; but I lost my mother just  then and was left the care of my paralytic father. If I had married  then, I should have had to take father from his familiar surroundings,  because Wallace came West in the forestry service. I felt that it  wouldn't be right. Poor father couldn't speak, but his eyes told me  how grateful he was to stay. We had our little home and father had  his pension, and I was able to get a small school near us. I could  take care of father and teach also. We were very comfortably situated,  and in time became really happy. Although I seldom heard from Wallace,  his letters were well worth waiting for, and I knew he was doing well.    \"Eighteen months ago father died,--gently went to sleep. I waited six  months and then wrote to Wallace, but received no reply. I have  written him three times and have had no word. I could bear it no  longer and have come to see what has become of him. If he is dead, may  I stay on with one of you and perhaps get a school? I want to live  here always.\"    \"But, darlint,\" said Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, \"supposin' it's married your  man is?\"    \"Wallace may have changed his mind about me, but he would not marry  without telling me. If he is alive he is honorable.\"    Then I asked, \"Why didn't you ask about him at Pinedale or any of  these places we have passed? If he is stationed in the Bridges reserve  they would be sure to know of him at any of these little places.\"    \"I just didn't have the courage to. I should never have told you what  I have, only I think I owe it to you, and it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28601"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, June, 1880 (#8)"],[1," by the pure, unadulterated teachings of the Savior of men, which  lie behind the fifteen hundred years of jargon upon the questions of  Trinitarian and Unitarian \"_isms_.\"    \"God is a spirit.\" That settles the question of \"person\" with every well  instructed Christian mind. \"What man knoweth the things of a man save the  spirit of man which is in him; even so the things of God knoweth no man  but the Spirit of God.\" The Spirit of God is the _Supreme intelligence_.  And, being such, he is the _Supreme person_, for where there is  _intelligence_ there is person. The attributes of personality belong to  intelligence, and they belong to nothing else. If you have an  _intelligent_ essence, it is, of a logical and scientific necessity, a  person. Let some Pantheistic \"wiseacre\" grapple with this thought.    The fatal mistakes are not all confined to Catholics and Protestants;  Pantheists and Scientists have made full as many mistakes. The great  mistake upon the subject of the Divine existence, which Scientists and  Pantheists have made, is the conclusion that person is simply and  necessarily _material_, or animal existence. So they say, if God is a  person he must be a great big _almighty_ man, having great arms and legs,  etc. I have the first Atheist or Pantheist to meet in conversation that  understands the truth of science in reference to this question of  _person_.    It is claimed that a Monotheistic Pantheism, that is, the idea of _one  essence_, not person, but _essence_, is to _unite_, or make one, the whole  human family upon the scientific (sciolistic) base that man himself is one  grand part of the grand all-pervading, impersonal essence.    Religions have their practical results, and, consequently, bearings upon  human society. The Monotheistic idea, which, it is claimed, is to equalize  all beings and things throughout this vast universe, in the conception  that all are parts of the same grand all-pervading essence, can have only  the following results: First, to wipe out all ideas of a future  retribution, for want of judge, for want of governor; second, to destroy  all distinctions consequent upon the ideas of a divine moral kingdom, or  Kingdom of God among men; third, to loosen up the religious and moral  restraints by removing the religious sanctions, or promises and threats,  which relate to the future retribution.    The advocates of this universal religion of the future, which is simply  universal non-religion, say \"Protestantism is the grave digger of  Christianity.\" \"But Christianity stoutly refuses to be buried alive,\" and  the multitude of facts that are continually transpiring demonstrate a  living, active existence; \"its blood circulates; its pulse is certainly  beating;\" its force is not spent in the least; it is always giving but is  never growing lean; \"it has a long lease of life.\" All the trees of the  forest stand together in one grand old struggle for life. It may be that  Christianity will be under the necessity of struggling, for many years to  come, with the Godless forms of _Pantheism_ and _Atheism_, which are  simply two different phases of the same Godless philosophy; but the seeds  of the great Christian tree, in these United States, are being shaken down  into the tender and warm soil of millions of hearts in all our  Sunday-schools, and it will be many a year before Christianity dies.            BILL OF INDICTMENTS AGAINST PROTESTANTS.      _First._ The idea of total hereditary depravity which never can be  correlated with accountability.    _Second._ The idea of those who were never converted being rewarded  according to their own deeds, when they were never upon trial; for a man  must have ability to try before he can be tried, and that ability must  extend to the accomplishment of that to which the trial relates. Wesley's  Discipline says, The condition of man since the fall of Adam is such that  he can not, by his own natural strength, turn and prepare himself to faith  and calling upon God, without the grace of God by Christ going before to  give him good will, and working with him when he has that good will.    If it is improper to say that a man can by his own natural strength turn  and prepare himself to faith and calling upon God, it is, also, improper  to say he is naturally accountable, for where ability ceases,  accountability also terminates. But a prop is found in \"the grace of God  by Christ going before to give a good will, and to work with that good  will.\" So the grace of God by Christ must go before to displace a bad will  by giving \"a good one.\" But this fails to relieve the doctrine from  embarrassment; for if the sinner is unwilling, has a bad will, it is  claimed that the Spirit goes away and leaves him to die in his  helplessness. Does the Omnipotent Spirit go to a man to give him a good  will, and then refuse to give it because the poor man has it not already?  Do you say he resisted? Well, well; suppose he did? _What_, is that in the  way of an Omnipotent Spirit? Who can explain such nonsense?    If I had a son laboring under the conviction that the Bible is the source  of such teachings, and he was to become disgusted and fall out with it on  that account, I should be proud of his common-sense. Is the poor man  mocked in that manner? If he dies in his sins, on account of his not being  in possession of a good will, can his future reward be according to the  deeds done by himself? No! He was never on trial--he had no ability to try.  There is just as much sense in the idea that an ape is on trial. Adam, the  first, ruined him; and Adam, the second, did not help him. Can a man be  justly condemned because he was not what he never had the power to be?    _Third._ The idea that the Lord would command men to _convert themselves_,  knowing, at the same time, that they could not do it. He commands men to  convert. He \"commands all men everywhere to repent.\" He knows, also, that  they can do it; so Protestantism, to the contrary, is an everlasting  disgrace to our religion. The original term translated by the word convert  is in the _imperative active_ in many places. Our translators put it in  the passive in the third chapter of Acts, where it is imperative active in  the original. Why they did this no scholar can tell, unless it was to  favor their Calvinistic ideas upon conversion. The term occurs forty-seven  times in the New Testament, and it is translated thirty-eight times by the  words _turn_ and _return_.    Paul says he \"showed to the people that THEY SHOULD TURN TO GOD, and do  works meet for repentance.\"    This great thought harmonizes with all that is taught upon the subject of  future rewards. A man _can turn_, and he is therefore accountable. To make  man responsible, it must be shown that he is capable, or able. This is the  one great fact that lies at the foundation of future rewards and  punishment. Take this fact away and the justice of God is imperiled by the  teachings of the Bible upon the subject of the future retribution. I know  that men who are under the influence of the traditions of their fathers  and mothers turn from the truth upon this question and say hard things  against it; but I know, also, that those same men speak the same sentiment  when they talk about the future judgment.    _Fourth._ The idea that the Divine Spirit must convert the man, and that  it passes the unwilling soul without giving him ability that he may be  tried, for a man must be able to attain the desired object, otherwise  trial is mere mockery. So, according to this kind of teaching, justice is  mocked, and the sinner is sent to perdition without anything more than a  mock trial; _i.e._, without being tried. If this be not true, the theory  of helplessness growing out of Adam's sin is utterly false, and man's  salvation, under all dispensations, is presented to us as a matter that  was, and is, disposed of by himself, he being able, in his own natural  strength, to turn and prepare himself to faith and calling upon God.  Again, all men pray. It is instinctive to pray. It is an instinct that  defies reason and philosophy. If men have not \"natural strength to turn  and prepare themselves to faith and calling upon God,\" then they are not  _naturally_ responsible _nor_ accountable.    _Fifth._ The idea that the Spirit goes to the unwilling sinner to give him  a good will, and then, because the man is not willing already, departs  from him, leaving him in his sins to continue in his helpless, wicked  condition until, having passed a mock judgment, he is banished to outer  darkness, for if the man was never able to do otherwise on account of his  helplessness, why should he be condemned? Tell him it is for his own deeds  and you mock his good sense.    _Sixth._ The idea that Christ died for an elect few, and damns all the  balance because they don't believe he died for them, _when he did not_.    _Seventh._ The idea that Christ died for a few, and commissioned his  disciples to preach the fact to all nations--to every creature, as \"glad  tidings of great joy,\" which was \"to be unto all people,\" when it is,  according to the doctrine that he did not die for all, positively no good  news to any soul that was passed by.    _Eighth._ The idea that all who are finally lost, will be in that sad  condition because of unbelief, when, if they had believed that Christ died  for them they would have believed a falsehood, because Calvinists say no  soul for whom Jesus died will be lost.            A SUMMARY OF TRUTH.      _First._ By the transgression man's eyes were opened, and he became as  God, to know good and evil.    _Second._ He has always had intellectual and moral ability to turn and  serve God, and so enjoy his divine favor.    _Third._ He has been required in every dispensation to do this.    _Fourth._ Christ died for all men.    _Fifth._ All men may turn and be saved.    _Sixth._ God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that  feareth"]]]
