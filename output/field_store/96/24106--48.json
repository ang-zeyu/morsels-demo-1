Major Rethman, in command of 300 Natal Mounted Rifles, also actively  engaged the enemy near Acton Homes, but was also compelled to retire for  fear of being cut off. Being quite conversant with Boer tactics, he  refused to be drawn by the pretence of retreat made by the Dutchmen,  knowing that concealed forces of the enemy in great numbers were waiting  to entrap him. Major Rethman, believing in the old saw that brevity is  the soul of wit, reported his loss as \"one hat.\"    The Dutchmen now advanced. An armoured train, sent by Sir George White  to bring in wounded from Bester's Farm, returned discomfited, as the  rails over the bridge four miles off Ladysmith had been tampered with.  It was found that a farm, which had been deserted earlier in the day,  was now in the occupation of the Boers, but these, though established on  the south side of the line, made no effort to attack the train and  allowed it to return unmolested. Rumours of fighting were in the air,  and skirmishes between advance parties of British troops and Boers were  the order of the day. A report reached the Glencoe camp that the Boers  had been seen some seven miles off, whereupon Major Laming with a  squadron of the 18th Hussars rode out to reconnoitre. Lieutenant Cape,  the advanced officer's patrol, discovered a strong advance party of the  enemy, who delivered a heavy fire, but fortunately without result. This  most probably was due to the swift and clever manoeuvring of the  Hussars.    The Carabineers and Border Mounted Rifles, who were in action nearly the  whole of the 18th of October, returned to camp at three in the morning  of the 19th. They were quite worn out and famished, having been for  twenty-four hours without food, and three days and two nights in the  saddle. Considering the excitement and fatigue, they were in excellent  spirits. Their experience was a novel one, for on this occasion the  Boers, who usually prefer to skulk under cover, made incipient rushes  at certain points. They gave way, however, before the pressing  attentions of the Maxims, and fled helter-skelter to cover again; but  their departure was on the principle of \"those who fight and run away  live to fight another day.\" They reserved themselves for a more decisive  effort.    At midday on the 19th a mixed train running from Ladysmith to Dundee was  captured by the enemy about a mile off Elandslaagte Station, which  stands about fifteen miles from Ladysmith, and is the first station from  thence on the line. A war correspondent was taken prisoner, four  Carabineers were wounded, and some horses and cattle seized. Telegraphic  communication in the north was cut off, and four trucks of stores in the  Elandslaagte Station were captured.                                THE BATTLE OF GLENCOE    On the night of the 19th, Sir W. Penn Symons discovered that he was  surrounded by the enemy. Three of their columns were converging on his  position--one from the north-west under General Erasmus by the  Dannhauser-Hattingspruit road; one from Utrecht and Vryheid by  Landsman's Drift from the east, under Commandant Lucas Meyer; and a  third under General Viljoen from Waschbank on the south, this latter  being the force which cut through the Ladysmith-Dundee railway.    The Boer plan was to deliver simultaneously different attacks from all  sides of the Glencoe camp. The column under Erasmus was to open the  attack from the north-west, and falling back, was to draw Symons in  pursuit away from his camp. Then Viljoen and Meyer were to close on the  pursuers from either flank and annihilate them.    Fortunately this skilfully-devised programme was not fulfilled. For this  reason: The force under Lucas Meyer was the first to arrive, and its  leader, impatient to secure the glories of war, decided on an  independent course of action. Before the other columns could put in an  appearance he opened the attack. On the hills round Glencoe the Boers  had posted cannon, and from thence at daybreak on the 20th of October  Meyer's gunners began to fire plugged shells into the camp. A flash--a  puff of smoke--a whizz and a crash! Hostilities had begun! By 5 A.M. all  General Symons's troops were under arms. It was evident that the enemy  were in force, and that their guns were some half-a-dozen in number.  Their range was 5000 yards, but, fortunately, their shots, though well  directed, flew screaming overhead and buried themselves in the soft  earth, doing no damage whatever. A few tents fell, a few marquees were  torn up. That was all. Our artillery soon came into action, at first at  too long a range, but afterwards--from a position south of Dundee--with  greater success. They then replied to the enemy's challenge with  considerable warmth and excellent effect; and, since our batteries  numbered some three to one, by 11.30 o'clock the enemy's Krupps were  silenced. In the meantime the infantry, the 1st King's Royal Rifles and  the 2nd Dublin Fusiliers, formed for attack opposite the enemy's  position, which was situated some two miles off at the top of an almost  impregnable hill. Huge boulders margined the sides of it, and half-way  up an encircling wall added to the impassability of the position. But  the word impossible is not to be found in the dictionary of a soldier,  and General Symons gave an order. The hill was to be taken. The bugles  rang out; the infantry fixed bayonets. Then was enacted another, only a  grander, Majuba, but now with the position of the contending forces  inverted. Doubtless the memory of that historic defeat inspired our men,  for they evidently decided that what the Boer had done, the Briton also  could do, and, spurred by their officers, who showed an absolute  disregard of the possibilities of danger, went ahead and carried the  crest in magnificent style. No such brilliant achievement of British  infantry has been recorded since Albuera. But this, as we shall see, was  not accomplished in a moment. It involved tremendous exposure in  crossing an open plain intersected with nullahs under a terrific fire,  followed by a long spell of dogged climbing, finally on hand and knees,  over more than a mile of broken, sometimes almost perpendicular, ground,  and in the midst of an incessant and furious fusilade.    [Illustration: POSITION OF FORCES BEFORE THE BATTLE OF GLENCOE.]    At 7.30 A.M. the head of the Hattingspruit column appeared; appeared but  to vanish--for it was at once saluted by the 67th Field Battery, and  being unprepared for this somewhat boisterous attention, made haste to  beat a retreat. At 8.50 the infantry brigade was ordered to advance.  Soon the Dublin Fusiliers and the Rifles, who had been reinforced by the  Royal Irish Fusiliers, were steadily moving on, firing by sections, and  using what cover the ground afforded. Overhead, from the hill  described, and from another south of the road, the ever-active shells  continued their grim music, while all around was the dense curtain of  fine rain that drizzled down like wet needles from an opaque sky, making  a screen between the opposing forces. But on and on, led by their  gallant officers, our infantry continued to toil, their advance ever  covered by the 13th and 67th Field Batteries--under the command  respectively of Major Dawkins and Major Wing--while the enemy from above  poured upon them volley after volley as hard as rifles would let them.  When half-way up, where the kopje was girded by a flat terrace and a  stone wall, the troops, scattered by the terrific fire, hot, drenched,  and panting with their climb, made a halt. There, under the lea of the  hill, it was necessary to get \"a breather,\" and to gather themselves  together for the supreme effort. The scene was not exhilarating. The  grey mist falling--the scattered earth and mud rising and spluttering,  the shrieking shells rending the air, already vibrant with the whirr of  bullets--the closer sounds and sights of death and destruction--all  these things were sufficient to stem the courage of stoutest hearts.  Still the British band remained undaunted, still they prepared boldly  for the final rush. Presently, with renewed energy the three gallant  regiments, steadily and determinedly as ever, started off, scaled the  wall, clambered up the steep acclivity, and finally, with a rush and a  roar as of released pandemonium, charged the crest.    The rout of the enemy was complete. At the glint of the steel they  turned and ran--ran like panic-stricken sheep, helter-skelter over the  hill, in the direction of Landmann's and Vant's Drifts. Their retreat  was harried by cavalry and mounted infantry, and, so far as it was  possible, in view of the inaccessible position, by the field artillery.  At this juncture the enemy displayed a white flag--without any intention  of surrender, it appears--but our firing was stopped by order of the  artillery commander. Two guns and several prisoners were captured,  together with horses and various boxes of shells for Maxim, Nordenfeldt,  and Krupp quick-firing guns. Our wounded were many, and some companies  looked woefully attenuated as the remnant, when all was over, whistled  themselves back to camp. Their gallant leader, General Penn Symons, who  had taken no precautions to keep under cover, but, on the contrary, had  made himself conspicuous in being accompanied by a lancer with a red  flag, fell early in the fight, mortally wounded. His place was taken by  Brigadier-General Yule, whose position at that time was far from  enviable. A message had been brought in by scouts, stating that some  9000 Boers were marching with the intention of attacking the British in  the rear, and that at the very moment the advancing multitude might be  cloaked in a dark mist that was gathering round the hills. Fortunately  the hovering hordes failed to appear, and the first big engagement"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26278"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume 1, (#8)"],[1,"Pliocene in the clays of Canada. The Pliocene species  are the more recent; such is, in fact, the meaning of the term in  geology. The mollusk of Canada Pliocene clay has undergone no change  since its first appearance upon our globe.    In order to account for ancient life, that passed away, as far back as  the carboniferous age, it is claimed that millions of years passed  before that age began. But here are the very first species of mollusca  in the more recent clays unchanged, and here are the same little animals  that floored so much territory in the bygone with chalk. How does this  look by the side of the last quotation from Darwin?    Crabs or lobsters, cuttle-fish, jelly-fish, star-fish, oysters, snails,  and worms lived contemporary with the first vertebrates. I have recently  read an article in which it is said by an advocate of the Darwinian  hypothesis, that man in his original condition was a cannibal, feasting,  ordinarily, upon snails and worms. Now, it is claimed that millions of  years have passed, and that millions of years inevitably destroy old  species and introduce new ones; and yet here are the same old pesky  snails and worms. If millions of years have passed the system is false.  And if millions of years have not passed the system is false; so it is  certainly false.    Hybrids are wonderfully in the way of the hypothesis. They can not be  saved. All artificial varieties return to their simple form. Mr. Huxley  recognizes this as an objection that can not be surmounted. He says,  \"While it remains Darwin's doctrine, must be content to remain a mere  hypothesis;\" that is, a mere guess.    In the latest productions of Agassiz we have this statement: \"As a  palaeontologist I have from the beginning stood aloof from this new  theory of transmutation, now so widely admitted; its doctrines, in fact,  contradict what the animal forms buried in the rocky strata of our earth  tell us of their own introduction and succession upon the surface of the  globe.\"    The first vertebrates are sharks, ganoids and garpikes, which are the  highest in structure of all known fishes. Darwin's hypothesis demands  this order _reversed_.    When you ask an evolutionist for the links connecting new and old  species, as he is pleased to denominate them, you receive the  satisfactory (?) answer, \"They are lost.\" A painter presented a man with  a red canvass, claiming that it represented the children of Israel  crossing the Red sea. The question was asked, \"Where are the  Israelites?\" The painter answered, \"They have crossed over.\" \"But,\" said  the man, \"where are the Egyptians?\" \"O, my dear sir,\" said the artist,  \"they are under the sea.\" This is a very fine illustration of facts, if  Darwinism may boast of facts, for the connecting links between species  are \"under the sea\" of oblivion, never to be found, and the old species  \"have passed over.\" Mr. Darwin's apology is in these words: \"Every one  will admit that the geological record is imperfect; but very few can  believe that it is so very imperfect as my theory demands.\" This is a  grand concession. The \"wild speculation\" has no support from geology.  The blanket of oblivion, which Mr. Darwin and his friends spread over  the difficulty, is \"millions of years.\" In that length of time the  missing species, or links, would, of course, all pass out of sight. Is  this true? No. In the geological record millions of specimens are  fossilized and laid away in nature's great cabinet. Why not find a few  of the missing links there? Just one. \"One fact, gentlemen, if you  please.\" Science is certain knowledge. Is there certain knowledge of  missing links? Gentlemen, just bridge one gulf for us; the gulf lying  between any _two species_ will do. We get impatient, standing and  gazing. Look! Can you see across?    Mr. Darwin says, \"Professor Haeckel, in his general Morphology and other  works, has brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear on what he  calls phylogeny or the lines of descent of all organic beings.\"--_Origin  of Species, p. 381._    This author, Mr. Haeckel, has \"lines of descent\" which involves the idea  of a plurality of beginnings in the history of organic being; that is,  Mr. Haeckel claims a vertebrate series with a vertebrate lying at the  base of the series, and an articulate series with an articulate lying at  its base. So there must be A SPECIAL CREATION AT LAST. Hear him: \"There  appears, indeed, to be a limit given to the adaptability of every  organism by the type of its tribe or phylum. Thus, for example, no  vertebrate animal can acquire the ventral nerve chord of articulate  animals instead of the characteristic spinal marrow of the vertebrate  animals.\"--_History of Creation, vol. 1, p. 250._ So the vertebrate must  forever remain a vertebrate, and the articulate forever an articulate.  Were they both evolved from the same unit? We are anxious to know, how  from a pulpy mass of flesh, from a moneron, a creature of one substance,  _vertebrates_ were evolved. We would like to know, also, how a creature  of more than one substance could be evolved from a creature of one  substance without more being gotten out of the thing than there was in  it. Here spontaneous generation passes into a wreck. Do you see? The  pulpy mass of flesh, or moneron, from which so much has been \"evolved\"  was the result of \"the sun's rays falling upon the sea slime,\" and was  and is a creature of one substance, homogeneous. \"Natural selection\"  could not operate in the vertebrate type before it existed. It was  \"limited to the type or phylum.\" That is to say, natural selection could  evolve new species without limitation from each type, but could never  evolve a vertebrate from an articulate, nor an articulate from a  vertebrate. Then, how are the two series from the same unit; or, if they  are connected with two different units, how are those units the effect  of the same unintelligent cause? How are we going to cross this chasm  lying between the sun's rays and the sea slime upon the one hand, and  the articulate and the vertebrate upon the other? Darwin says, \"Judging  from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will  transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity.\" Well, how is it  with the past? We are told that millions of years are the demand for the  changes already brought about. Millions of years would certainly be  enough to constitute a \"distant futurity.\" How is it now? Is there not  one species having its likeness represented by a species in the distant  past? Yes; the genus lingula, the species appearing in all the ages, was  \"connected by an unbroken series of generations from the lowest Silurian  stratum to the present day.\"--_Origin of Species, pp. 293, 294, 428._    Darwin's \"theory\" claims that the first forms of all life still exist,  and are known and named. The ape, if it could talk like a man, would  boast of a history reaching all the way back to time prior to the  existence of the greater number of the mammals. To get rid of the  difficulty of first forms still existing, Mr. Darwin cuts off his unit  from the law of \"the survival of the fittest,\" or \"the inevitable  destruction of the parent form.\" He says: \"A very simple form, fitted  for very simple conditions of life, might remain for indefinite ages  unaltered, or unimproved; for what would it profit an infusorial  animalcule, or an intestinal worm, to become highly organized?\"--_Animals  and Plants, vol. 1, p. 19._ \"Under very simple conditions of life a  higher organism would be of no service.\"--_Origin of Species, p. 100._    How are we to reconcile the conflicting ideas in this speculation? At  one time we are taught that all forms of life were, originally, very  simple forms, existing under very simple conditions. At another time we  are taught that \"new and improved forms _inevitably_ supplant and  destroy parent forms.\" At another we are taught, at great length, the  doctrine of the survival of the fittest.    At another we are taught that all things have worked, and do work,  without designs upon the part of a present intelligence.    At another we are taught that very simple forms of life, under the very  simple conditions of life, have continued to the present day, because of  the fact that it would be of NO SERVICE for them to become highly  organized. No service to whom? To what end?    Out of thine own mouth will I condemn thee. What! Is there an end in  view that has governed in the great question of evolution of species,  and the survival of the fittest? Darwin seems to think so. The  wonderful \"machine\" that Strauss talked about in connection with the  \"smashing\" and \"crashing\" that destroys parent forms did not smash the  simplest forms of life. Why? The answer is, \"It would be of no service  for them to become highly organized.\" Then all the smashing and crashing  known in the doctrine of \"the survival of the fittest\" and in \"the  destruction of the parent form\" was under the supervision of some  controlling power, having an end to accomplish.           *       *       *       *       *    If we see a member of the church of Christ living in obedience to the  \"law of Christ,\" we say he is a Christian, and speak of him as such; on  the other hand, if we know he is in works denying Christ, being  disobedient, we tacitly assume that he is not a Christian, yet a  _mawkish charity_ keeps us, in too many instances, from speaking out in  this matter, and also keeps us from earnestly trying to distinguish the  true Christian; and this is one of the great sins of the church in our  times, for thus the wicked are not put to shame, and others are caused  to hesitate in their graces by the conduct of those whom, in mawk  charity, are called Christians.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Mouth-glue is made of pure glue, as parchment glue, or gelatine and  coarse brown sugar.
