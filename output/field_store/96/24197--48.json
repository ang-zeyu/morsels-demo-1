Always set the clock, however long you may delay on [the    letter \"A\"] afterwards you shall pour water from the    little pot (pottulo) that is there, into the reservoir    (cacabum) until it reaches the prescribed level, and you    must do the same when you set [the clock] after compline    so that you may sleep soundly.    A quite different sort of evidence is to be had from the writings of  Robertus Anglicus in 1271 where one gets the impression that just at  this time there was active interest in the attempt to make a  weight-driven anaphoric clock and to regulate its motion by some  unstated method so that it would keep time with the diurnal rotation of  the heavens:[36]      Nor it is possible for any clock to follow the judgment of    astronomy with complete accuracy. Yet clockmakers    (artifices horologiorum) are trying to make a wheel    (circulum) which will make one complete revolution for    every one of the equinoctial circle, but they cannot quite    perfect their work. But if they could, it would be a    really accurate clock (horologium verax valde) and worth    more than an astrolabe or other astronomical instrument    for reckoning the hours, if one knew how to do this    according to the method aforesaid. The method of making    such a clock would be this, that a man make a disc    (circulum) of uniform weight in every part so far as could    possibly be done. Then a lead weight should be hung from    the axis of that wheel (axi ipsius rote) and this weight    would move that wheel so that it would complete one    revolution from sunrise to sunrise, minus as much time as    about one degree rises according to an approximately    correct estimate. For from sunrise to sunrise, the whole    equinoctial rises, and about one degree more, through    which degree the sun moves against the motion of the    firmament in the course of a natural day. Moreover, this    could be done more accurately if an astrolabe were    constructed with a network on which the entire equinoctial    circle was divided up.    [Illustration: Figure 19.--MANUSCRIPT ILLUMINATION OF A MEDIEVAL  WATERCLOCK, showing a partitioned wheel, a weight drive, and a carillion  for striking. From Drover (see footnote 34).]    The text then continues with technical astronomical details of the  slight difference between the rate of rotation of the sun and of the  fixed stars (because of the annual rotation of the sun amongst the  stars) but it gives no indication of any regulatory device. Again it  should be noted, this source comes from France; Robertus, though of  English origin, apparently being then a lecturer either at the  University of Paris or at that of Montpellier. The date of this passage,  1271, has been taken as a _terminus post quem_ for the invention of the  mechanical clock. In the next section we shall describe the text of  Peter Peregrinus, very close to this in place and date, which describes  just such a machine, conflating it with accounts of an armillary sphere,  perpetual motion, and the magnetic compass--so bringing all these  threads together for the first time in Europe.    [Illustration: Figure 20.--ARRANGEMENT FOR TURNING A FIGURE OF AN ANGEL.  It has been alleged that this drawing by Villard represents an  escapement. After Lassus (see footnote 37).]    We have reserved to the last one section of evidence which may or may  not be misleading, the famous notebook of Villard (Wilars) of  Honnecourt, near Cambrai. The album, attributed to the period 1240-1251,  contains many drawings with short annotations, three of which are of  special interest to our investigations.[37] These comprise a steeplelike  structure labeled \"cest li masons don orologe\" (this is the house of a  clock), a device including a rope, wheel and axle (fig. 20), marked \"par  chu fait om un angle tenir son doit ades vers le solel\" (by this means  an angel is made to keep his finger directed towards the sun), and a  perpetual motion wheel which we shall reserve for later discussion.    The clock tower, according to Drover, shows no place for a dial but  suggests the use of bells because of its open structure, suitable for  letting out the sound. Moreover, he suggests that the delicacy of the  line indicates that it was not really a full-size steeple but rather a  small towerlike structure standing only a few feet high within the  church. There is, alas, nothing to tell us about the clock it was  intended to house; most probably it was a water clock similar to that of  the illustrated Bible of _ca._ 1285.    The drawing of the rope, wheel and axles, for turning an angel to point  towards the sun can have a simple explanation or a more complicated one.  If taken at its face value the wheel on its horizontal axis acts as a  windlass connected by the counterpoised rope to the vertical shaft which  it turns, thereby moving (by hand) the figure of an angel (not shown)  fixed to the top of this latter shaft. Such an explanation was in fact  suggested by M. Quicherat,[38] who first called attention to the Villard  album and pointed out that a leaden angel existed in Chartres before the  fire there in 1836. It is a view also supported from another drawing in  the album which describes an eagle whose head is made to turn towards  the deacon when he reads the Gospel. Slight pressure on the tail of the  bird causes a similar rope mechanism to operate.    A quite different interpretation has been suggested by Fremont;[39] he  believes that the wheel may have acted as a fly-wheel and the ropes and  counterpoises, turning first one way then the other acted as a sort of  mechanical escapement. Such an arrangement is however mechanically  impossible without some complicated free-wheeling device between the  drive and the escapement, and its only effect would be to oscillate the  angel rapidly rather than turn it steadily. I believe that Fremont,  over-anxious to provide a protoescapement, has done too much violence to  the facts and turned away without good reason from the more simple and  reasonable explanation. It is nevertheless still possible to adopt this  simple interpretation and yet to have the system as part of a clock. If  the left-hand counterpoise, conveniently raised higher than that on the  right, is considered as a float fitting into a clepsydra jar, instead of  as a simple weight, one would have a very suitable automatic system for  turning the angel. On this explanation, the purpose of the wheel would  be merely to provide the manual adjustment necessary to set the angel  from time to time, compensating for irremediable inaccuracies of the  clepsydra.    [Illustration: Figure 21.--VILLARD'S PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL, from Lassus  (see footnote 37).]    Having discussed the Villard drawings which are already cited in  horological literature, we must draw attention to the fact that this  medieval architect also gives an illustration of a perpetual motion  wheel. In this case (fig. 21) it is of the type having weights at the  end of swinging arms, a type that occurs very frequently at later dates  in Europe and is also given in the Islamic texts. We cannot, in this  case, suggest that drawings of clocks and of perpetual motion devices  occur together by more than a coincidence, for Villard seems to have  been interested in most sorts of mechanical device. But even this type  of coincidence becomes somewhat striking when repeated often enough. It  seems that each early mention of \"self-moving wheels\" occurs in  connection with some sort of clock or mechanized astronomical device.    Having now completed a survey of the traditions of astronomical models,  we have seen that many types of device embodying features later found in  mechanical clocks evolved through various cultures and flowed into  Europe, coming together in a burst of multifarious activity during the  second half of the 13th century, notably in the region of France. We  must now attempt to fill the residual gap, and in so doing examine the  importance of perpetual motion devices, mechanical and magnetic, in the  crucial transition from protoclock to mechanical-escapement clock.          Perpetual Motion and the Clock before de Dondi    We have already noted, more or less briefly, several instances of the  use of wheels \"moving by themselves\" or the use of a fluid for purposes  other than as a motive power. Chronologically arranged, these are the  Indian devices of _ca._ 1150 or a little earlier, as those of Ri[d.]w[=a]n  _ca._ 1200, that of the Alfonsine mercury clock, _ca._ 1272, and the  French Bible illumination of _ca._ 1285. This strongly suggests a steady  transmission from East to West, and on the basis of it, we now  tentatively propose an additional step, a transmission from China to  India and perhaps further West, _ca._ 1100, and possibly reinforced by  further transmissions at later dates.    One need only assume the existence of vague traveler's tales about the  existence of the 11th-century Chinese clocks with their astronomical  models and jackwork and with their great wheel, apparently moving by  itself but using water having no external inlet or outlet. Such a  stimulus, acting as it did on a later occasion when Galileo received  word of the invention of the telescope in the Low Countries, might  easily lead to the re-invention of just such perpetual-motion wheels as  we have already noted. In many ways, once the idea has been suggested it  is natural to associate such a perpetual motion with the incessant  diurnal rotation of the heavens. Without some such stimulus however it  is difficult to explain why this association did not occur earlier, and  why, once it comes there seems to be such a chronological procession  from culture to culture.    We now turn to what is undoubtedly the most curious part of this story,  in which automatically moving astronomical models and perpetual motion  wheels are linked with the earliest texts on magnetism and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#8)"],[1,"myself on your lordship's hands.\"--\"Mr. ----, I decline the  burden,\" replied the learned judge.    One day in judge's chambers, after being pressed by counsel very  strongly against his own views, he said with quaint humour: \"I'm one of  the most obstinate men in the world.\"--\"God forbid that I should be so  rude as to contradict your lordship,\" replied the counsel.    Mr. Montague Williams in his _Leaves of a Life_ relates the following  story of Mr. Justice Byles. He was once hearing a case in which a woman  was charged with causing the death of her child by not giving it proper  food, or treating it with the necessary care. Mr. F----, of the Western  Circuit, conducted the defence, and while addressing the jury said:    \"Gentlemen, it appears to be impossible that the prisoner can have  committed this crime. A mother guilty of such conduct to her own child?  Why, it is repugnant to our better feelings\"; and then being carried  away by his own eloquence, he proceeded: \"Gentlemen, the beasts of the  field, the birds of the air, suckle their young, and----\"    But at this point the learned judge interrupted him, and said:    \"Mr. F----, if you establish the latter part of your proposition, your  client will be acquitted to a certainty.\"    And to the same authority we are indebted for a judge's gentle but  sarcastic reproof of a prosing counsel. In an action for false  imprisonment, heard before Mr. Justice Wightman, Ribton was addressing  the jury at great length, repeating himself constantly, and never giving  the slightest sign of winding up. When he had been pounding away for  several hours, the good old judge interposed, and said: \"Mr. Ribton,  you've said that before.\"--\"Have I, my lord?\" said Ribton; \"I'm very  sorry. I quite forgot it.\"--\"Don't apologise, Mr. Ribton,\" was the  answer. \"I forgive you; for it was a very long time ago.\"    A very old story is told of a highwayman who sent for a solicitor and  inquired what steps were necessary to be taken to have his trial  deferred. The solicitor answered that he would require to get a doctor's  affidavit of his illness. This was accordingly done in the following  manner: \"The deponent verily believes that if the said ---- is obliged  to take his trial at the ensuing sessions, he will be in imminent danger  of his life.\"--\"I verily believe so too,\" replied the judge, and the  trial proceeded immediately.           *       *       *       *       *    Some judges profess ignorance of slang terms used in evidence, and seek  explanation from counsel. Lord Coleridge in the following story had his  inquiry not only answered but illustrated. A witness was describing an  animated conversation between the pursuer and defendant in a case and  said: \"Then the defendant turned and said, 'If 'e didn't 'owld 'is noise  'ed knock 'im off 'is peark.'\"--\"Peark? Mr. Shee, what is meant by  peark?\" asked the Lord Chief Justice. \"Oh, peark, my lord, is any  position when a man elevates himself above his fellows--for instance, a  bench, my lord.\"    Another story illustrating this alleged ignorance of every-day terms  used by the masses comes from the Scottish Court of Session. In this  instance the explanation was volunteered by the witness who used the  term. One of the counsel in the case was Mr. (now Lord) Dewar, who was  cross-examining the witness on a certain incident, and drew from him the  statement that he (the witness) had just had a \"nip.\" \"A nip,\" said the  judge; \"what is a nip?\"--\"Only a small Dewar, my lord,\" explained the  witness.    Lord Russell of Killowen, himself a Lord Chief Justice, tells some  amusing stories of Lord Coleridge in his interesting reminiscences of  that great judge in the _North American Review_. When at the Bar he was  counsel in a remarkable case--Saurin against Starr. The pursuer, an  Irish lady, sued the Superior of a religious order at Hull for expulsion  without reasonable cause. Mr. Coleridge cross-examined a Mrs. Kennedy,  one of the superintendents of the convent, who had mentioned in her  evidence, among other peccadilloes of the pursuer, that she had been  found in the pantry eating strawberries, when she should have been  attending some class duties.    Mr. Coleridge: \"Eating strawberries, really!\"    Mrs. Kennedy: \"Yes, sir, she was eating strawberries.\"    Mr. Coleridge: \"How shocking!\"    Mrs. Kennedy: \"It was forbidden, sir.\"    Mr. Coleridge: \"And did you, Mrs. Kennedy, really consider there was any  great harm in that?\"    Mrs. Kennedy: \"No, sir, not in itself, any more than there was harm in  eating an apple; but you know, sir, the mischief that came from that.\"    When as Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge visited the United States, he  was continually pestered by interviewers, and one of them failing to  draw him, began to disparage the old country in its physical features  and its men. Lord Coleridge bore it all in good part; finally the  interviewer said, \"I am told, my lord, you think a great deal of your  great fire of London. Well, I guess, that the conflagration we had in  the little village of Chicago made your great fire look very small.\" To  which his lordship blandly responded: \"Sir, I have every reason to  believe that the great fire of London was quite as great as the people  of that time desired.\"    There are few of Lord Bowen's witticisms from the Bench in circulation,  but his after-dinner stories are worth recording, and perhaps one of the  best is that given in _Anecdotes of the Bench and Bar_, as told by  himself in the following words: \"One of the ancient rabbinical writers  was engaged in compiling a history of the minor prophets, and in due  course it became his duty to record the history of the prophet Daniel.  In speaking of the most striking incident in the great man's career--I  refer to his critical position in the den of lions--he made a remark  which has always seemed to me replete with judgment and observation. He  said that the prophet, notwithstanding the trying circumstances in which  he was placed, had one consolation which has sometimes been forgotten.  He had the consolation of knowing that when the dreadful banquet was  over, at any rate it was not he who would be called upon to return  thanks.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The following story cannot be classed a witticism from the Bench, but  the judge clearly gave the opening for the lady's smart retort.    Mrs. Weldon, a well-known lady litigant in the Courts a generation ago,  was on one occasion endeavouring in the Court of Appeal to upset a  judgment of Vice-Chancellor Bacon, and one ground of complaint was that  the judge was too old to understand her case. Thereupon Lord Esher said:  \"The last time you were here you complained that your case had been  tried by my brother Bowen, and you said he was only a bit of a boy, and  could not do you justice. Now you come here and say that my brother  Bacon was too old. What age do you want the judge to be?\"--\"Your age,\"  promptly replied Mrs. Weldon, fixing her bright eyes on the handsome  countenance of the Master of the Rolls.    On Charles Phillips, who became a judge of the Insolvent Court, noticing  a witness kiss his thumb instead of the Testament, after rebuking him  said, \"You may think to _desave_ God, sir, but you won't desave me.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: SIR HENRY HAWKINS, LORD BRAMPTON.]    That racy and turf-attending judge, Lord Brampton, better known as Sir  Henry Hawkins, tells many good stories of himself in his  _Reminiscences_, but it is the unconscious humorist of Marylebone Police  Court who records this _bon mot_ of Sir Henry.    An old woman in the witness-box had been rattling on in the most voluble  manner, until it was impossible to make head or tail of her evidence.  Mr. Justice Hawkins, thinking he would try his hand, began with a  soothing question, but the old woman would not have it at any price. She  replied testily, \"It's no use you bothering me. I have told you all I  know.\"--\"That may be,\" replied his lordship, \"but the question rather  is, do you know all you have told us?\"    When Sir Henry (then Mr.) Hawkins was prosecuting counsel in the  Tichborne trial, over which Lord Chief Justice Cockburn presided, an  amusing incident is recorded by Mr. Plowden. The antecedents of a man  who had given sensational evidence for the claimant were being inquired  into, and in answer to Sir Henry the witness under examination said he  knew the man to be married, but his wife passed under another name.  \"What name?\" asked Mr. Hawkins. \"Mrs. Hawkins,\" replied the witness.  \"What was her maiden name?\" added Mr. Hawkins. \"Cockburn.\" Such a  coincident of names naturally caused hearty and prolonged laughter.    In the course of this celebrated trial another amusing incident occurred  which Sir Henry used to tell against himself. One morning as the  claimant came into Court, a lady dressed in deep mourning presented  Orton with a tract. After a few minutes he wrote something on it, and  had it passed on to the prosecuting counsel. The tract was boldly headed  in black type, \"Sinner--Repent,\" and the claimant had written upon it,  \"Surely this must have been meant for Hawkins.\"    Not long after he had ascended the Bench Mr. Justice Hawkins was hearing  a case in which a man was being tried for murder. The counsel for the  prosecution observed the prisoner say something earnestly to the  policeman seated by his side in the dock, and asked that the constable  should be made to disclose what had passed. \"Yes,\" said his lordship, \"I  think you may demand that. Constable, inform the Court what passed  between you and the prisoner.\"--\"I--I would rather not, your lordship. I  was--.\"--\"Never mind what you would rather not do. Inform the Court what  the prisoner said.\"--\"He asked me, your lordship, who that hoary heathen  with the sheepskin was, as he had often seen him at the  race-course.\"--\"That will do,\""]]]
