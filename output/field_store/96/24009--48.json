Let us think      Of what is to be done to justify      Thy planets and their portents. When we conquer,                    70      They shall have temples--aye, and priests--and thou      Shalt be the pontiff of--what Gods thou wilt;      For I observe that they are ever just,      And own the bravest for the most devout.        _Bel._ Aye, and the most devout for brave--thou hast not      Seen me turn back from battle.        _Arb._                         No; I own thee      As firm in fight as Babylonia's captain,      As skilful in Chaldea's worship: now,      Will it but please thee to forget the priest,      And be the warrior?        _Bel._              Why not both?        _Arb._                           The better;                        80      And yet it almost shames me, we shall have      So little to effect. This woman's warfare      Degrades the very conqueror. To have plucked      A bold and bloody despot from his throne,      And grappled with him, clashing steel with steel,      That were heroic or to win or fall;      But to upraise my sword against this silkworm,[15]      And hear him whine, it may be----        _Bel._                           Do not deem it:      He has that in him which may make you strife yet;      And were he all you think, his guards are hardy,                    90      And headed by the cool, stern Salemenes.        _Arb._ They'll not resist.        _Bel._                     Why not? they are soldiers.        _Arb._                                                True,      And therefore need a soldier to command them.        _Bel._ That Salemenes is.        _Arb._                    But not their King.      Besides, he hates the effeminate thing that governs,      For the Queen's sake, his sister. Mark you not      He keeps aloof from all the revels?        _Bel._                              But      Not from the council--there he is ever constant.        _Arb._ And ever thwarted: what would you have more      To make a rebel out of? A fool reigning,                           100      His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:      Why, it is _his_ revenge we work for.        _Bel._                                Could      He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.        _Arb._ What, if we sound him?        _Bel._                       Yes--if the time served.                                  _Enter_ BALEA.        _Bal._ Satraps! The king commands your presence at      The feast to-night.        _Bel._              To hear is to obey.      In the pavilion?        _Bal._           No; here in the palace.        _Arb._ How! in the palace? it was not thus ordered.        _Bal._ It is so ordered now.        _Arb._                        And why?        _Bal._                                I know not.      May I retire?        _Arb._       Stay.        _Bel._ (_to Arb. aside_). Hush! let him go his way.                110      (_Alternately to Bal._) Yes, Balea, thank the Monarch, kiss the hem      Of his imperial robe, and say, his slaves      Will take the crumbs he deigns to scatter from      His royal table at the hour--was't midnight?        _Bal._ It was: the place, the hall of Nimrod. Lords,      I humble me before you, and depart.                     [_Exit_ BALEA.        _Arb._ I like not this same sudden change of place;      There is some mystery: wherefore should he change it?        _Bel._ Doth he not change a thousand times a day?      Sloth is of all things the most fanciful--                         120      And moves more parasangs in its intents      Than generals in their marches, when they seek      To leave their foe at fault.--Why dost thou muse?        _Arb._ He loved that gay pavilion,--it was ever      His summer dotage.        _Bel._             And he loved his Queen--      And thrice a thousand harlotry besides--      And he has loved all things by turns, except      Wisdom and Glory.        _Arb._            Still--I like it not.      If he has changed--why, so must we: the attack      Were easy in the isolated bower,                                   130      Beset with drowsy guards and drunken courtiers;      But in the hall of Nimrod----        _Bel._                         Is it so?      Methought the haughty soldier feared to mount      A throne too easily--does it disappoint thee      To find there is a slipperier step or two      Than what was counted on?        _Arb._                    When the hour comes,      Thou shall perceive how far I fear or no.      Thou hast seen my life at stake--and gaily played for:      But here is more upon the die--a kingdom.        _Bel._ I have foretold already--thou wilt win it:                  140      Then on, and prosper.        _Arb._                Now were I a soothsayer,      I would have boded so much to myself.      But be the stars obeyed--I cannot quarrel      With them, nor their interpreter. Who's here?                                _Enter_ SALEMENES.        _Sal._ Satraps!        _Bel._            My Prince!        _Sal._                     Well met--I sought ye both,      But elsewhere than the palace.        _Arb._                         Wherefore so?        _Sal._ 'Tis not the hour.        _Arb._                    The hour!--what hour?        _Sal._                                         Of midnight.        _Bel._ Midnight, my Lord!        _Sal._                     What, are you not invited?        _Bel._ Oh! yes--we had forgotten.        _Sal._                             Is it usual      Thus to forget a Sovereign's invitation?        _Arb._ Why--we but now received it.                                150        _Sal._                              Then why here?        _Arb._ On duty.        _Sal._           On what duty?        _Bel._                         On the state's.      We have the privilege to approach the presence;      But found the Monarch absent.[k]        _Sal._                        And I too      Am upon duty.        _Arb._       May we crave its purport?        _Sal._ To arrest two traitors. Guards! Within there!                                 _Enter Guards_.        _Sal._ (_continuing_).                               Satraps,      Your swords.        _Bel._ (_delivering his_). My lord, behold my scimitar.        _Arb._ (_drawing his sword_). Take mine.        _Sal._ (_advancing_).                     I will.        _Arb._                             But in your heart the blade--      The hilt quits not this hand.[l]        _Sal._ (_drawing_).         How! dost thou brave me?      Tis well--this saves a trial, and false mercy.                     160      Soldiers, hew down the rebel!        _Arb._                        Soldiers! Aye--      _Alone, you_ dare not.        _Sal._                Alone! foolish slave--      What is there in thee that a Prince should shrink from      Of open force? We dread thy treason, not      Thy strength: thy tooth is nought without its venom--      The serpent's, not the lion's. Cut him down.        _Bel._ (_interposing_). Arbaces! Are you mad? Have I not rendered      _My_ sword? Then trust like me our Sovereign's justice.        _Arb._   No--I will sooner trust the stars thou prat'st of,      And this slight arm, and die a king at least                       170      Of my own breath and body--so far that      None else shall chain them.        _Sal._ (_to the Guards_).     You hear _him_ and _me_.      Take him not,--kill.

Recreants! see      How you should fell a traitor.

Pronounce in person.      Here I am but your slave--a moment past                            190      I was your representative.        _Sar._                     Then sheathe      Your swords.

(_To a Guard_.) Here, fellow, take thy weapon back. Well, sirs,      What doth this mean?        _Bel._               The Prince must answer that.        _Sal._ Truth upon my part, treason upon theirs.     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#8)"],[1,"he parted with Columbus, who, returning on  board, two days afterwards set sail, the garrison on shore answering the  cheers of their comrades who were about to return to their native land.  The ship, being towed out of the harbour, they stood to the eastward,  but were detained for two days by a contrary wind.    On the 6th, a seaman aloft cried out that he saw the _Pinta_.  The  certainty that he was right cheered the heart of the Admiral and his  crew.  In a short time she approached, and, as the wind was contrary,  Columbus put back to a little bay west of Monte Cristo, where he was  followed by the _Pinta_.    Pinzon endeavoured to excuse himself, but Columbus discovered that he  had purposely separated, and had gone to Hispaniola, where he had  remained trading with the natives; collecting a considerable quantity of  gold, the greater part of which he retained, and the rest divided among  the men to secure his secret.    Columbus, however, knowing the number of friends the Pinzons had on  board, repressed his indignation; but so much was his confidence in his  confederates impaired, that, instead of continuing his explorations, as  he hoped to have done when he first saw the _Pinta_, he resolved at once  to sail for Spain.    While obtaining wood and water for the voyage at a river flowing into  the bay, so much gold was perceived in the sand at its mouth that the  name of Rio del Oro, or the Golden River, was given to it.  At present  it is called the Santiago.  Turtles of large size were found here, and,  as a proof how so sagacious a man as Columbus might deceive himself, he  states that he here saw three mermaids, who were very far from lovely,  although they had traces of human countenances.  They were undoubtedly  manatees or sea-cows.    Putting into the river where Pinzon had been trading, some of the  natives complained that he had violently carried off four men and two  girls to be sold as slaves in Spain.    Discovering that such was the case, Columbus ordered that they should be  restored immediately to their homes, and, giving them numerous presents  and clothing, he sent them on shore.    Proceeding on, they anchored in a deep gulf a little way beyond Cape  Cabron.  The natives were found to be of a ferocious aspect, hideously  painted.  Their hair was long, tied behind, and decorated with coloured  feathers; some were armed with war-clubs; others had bows as long as  those used by English archers, with slender reed arrows pointed with  bone or the teeth of a fish.  Their swords were of palm wood, as hard  and heavy as iron, not sharp, but broad, and capable, with one blow, of  cleaving through a helmet.    Columbus fancied that they must be Caribs, but an Indian on board  assured him that the Caribbean Islands were much farther off.  They made  no attempt, however, at first, to molest the Spaniards.  One of them  came on board the Admiral's ship.  Various presents having been given  him, he was sent again on shore in one of the boats.    As she approached, upwards of fifty savages, armed with bows, arrows,  war-clubs, and javelins, were seen lurking among the trees.  The Indian,  however, speaking to them, they laid by their arms, and parted with two  of their bows to the Spaniards.  Suddenly, however, mistrusting their  visitors, they rushed back to where they had left their weapons, and  returned with cords as if to bind the Spaniards.  The latter on this  immediately attacked them, wounded two, and put the rest to flight, and  would have pursued them had they not been restrained by the commander of  the boat.    This was the first time native blood, soon to flow so freely, was shed  by the white man in the New World.  It greatly grieved Columbus thus to  see his efforts to maintain a friendly intercourse frustrated.    Next day, notwithstanding the above occurrence, when a large party went  on shore, the cacique who ruled over the neighbourhood came down to meet  them, and sent a wampum belt as a token of amity.  The cacique, with  only three attendants, without fear entered the boat, and was conveyed  on board the caravel.  Columbus highly appreciated this frank, confiding  conduct, and, having placed biscuits and honey and other food before his  guests, shown them round the ship, and made them several presents, he  sent them back to the land highly gratified.  No other interruption  occurred to their friendly intercourse.  Four young Indians who came on  board gave such glowing accounts of the islands to the east, that  Columbus prevailed on them to accompany him as guides.  He also wished  to visit two islands which he fancied to exist,--one inhabited by  Amazons, and the other by men; but a favourable breeze springing up for  Spain, and observing the gloom in the countenances of the seamen,--  knowing as he did also their insubordinate spirit, and the leaky state  of the ships, and that, should they founder, his glorious discovery  would be lost to the civilised world,--he deemed it wise to steer  directly homewards.  The favourable breeze, however, soon died away, and  for the remainder of the voyage light winds from the eastward prevailed.    The _Pinta_ also sailed badly, her foremast being so defective that it  could carry but little sail.  In the early part of February, having run  to about the thirty-eighth degree of north latitude, they got out of the  track of the trade winds, and once more were able to steer a direct  course.  The pilots, by the changes of their courses, at length got  perplexed; but Columbus kept so careful a reckoning that he felt sure of  their position.  The two principal pilots made out that they were one  hundred and fifty leagues nearer Spain than he knew to be the case.  He,  however, allowed them to remain in their error, that he alone might  possess a knowledge of the route to the newly-discovered countries.  By  his calculation they were not far off from the Azores.  On the 12th of  February a strong gale with a heavy sea got up, and the next day the  wind and swell so increased that Columbus was aware that a heavy tempest  was approaching.  It soon burst upon them with frightful violence,  increasing still more on the 14th, the waves threatening every moment to  overwhelm their battered barks.  After laying to for three hours they  were compelled to scud before the wind.  During the darkness of the  night the _Pinta_ was lost sight of.  The Admiral steered as well as he  could to the north-east to approach the coast of Spain, showing lights  to the _Pinta_; but no answering signals were seen, and fears were  entertained that she had foundered.  The following day the tempest raged  as furiously as before on the helpless bark.  During the storm the  ignorant and superstitious crew cast lots as to who should perform  pilgrimages to their respective saints, in which the Admiral, no less  superstitious than his men, joined.  Two of the lots fell on him.  Each  man also made his private vow to perform some pilgrimage, or other  penitential rite.    The heavens, however, were deaf to their vows.  The storm increased, and  the crew gave themselves up for lost.  The Admiral took the wisest steps  to preserve the ship, by ordering that the empty casks should be filled  with water, to ballast her better.  His mind all the time was a prey to  the most painful anxiety.  His fear was that the _Pinta_ had already  foundered, and that his vessel would also go to the bottom.    An expedient occurred to him at this time by which, though he and his  ships should perish, the glory of his achievement might survive to his  name, and its advantages be secured to his sovereigns.  He wrote on a  parchment a brief account of his voyage and discovery; then, having  sealed and directed it to the King and Queen, he wrapped it in a waxed  cloth, which he placed in the centre of a piece of wax, and, enclosing  the whole in a large cask, threw it into the sea.  He also enclosed a  copy in a similar manner, placing the cask on the poop so that it might  float off should the vessel sink.    These precautions somewhat mitigated his anxiety.  Towards sunset a  streak of clear sky appeared in the west, the sign of finer weather.  It  came, though the sea ran so high that little sail could be carried.    At daybreak on the morning of the 15th the cry of \"Land!\" was raised.  The transports of the crew equalled those exhibited on first beholding  the New World.  Various conjectures were offered as to what land it was.  Some thought it the rock of Cintra, others the island of Madeira,  others a portion of Spain.  Columbus, however, knew that it was one of  the Azores, in possession of the Portuguese.    On the evening of the 17th of February the vessel dropped her anchor off  the island of Saint Mary's, the most southern of the Azores, and at  length the great navigator was enabled to enjoy the first moments of  sleep he had taken for many a day.    Next morning the inhabitants were astonished, on seeing the battered  vessel, that she had been able to live through the gale, which had, with  unexampled fury, raged for fifteen days.  Three seamen who had landed  were persuaded to remain and give an account of their adventures.    After some time the Governor, Juan de Castaneda, who claimed an  acquaintance with Columbus, sent off fowls, bread, and various  refreshments, apologising for not coming himself, on account of the  lateness of the hour.    On the following morning Columbus reminded his people of their vows, to  go in procession to the shrine of the Virgin at the first place where  they should land.  The messengers who had been kept on board were sent  to make preparations, and a priest arrived at a small chapel dedicated  to the Virgin some little distance off.  One-half of the crew then  landed and walked in procession, barefooted and in their shirts, to the  chapel, while the Admiral waited their return to perform the same  ceremony with the remainder.
