It is not so very  amusing, but one may very well hear it once. It was such a decent old  street-lamp, that had done its duty for many, many years, but now it  was to be condemned. It was the last evening,--it sat there on the  post and lighted the street; and it was in just such a humor as an old  figurante in a ballet, who dances for the last evening, and knows that  she is to be put on the shelf to-morrow. The lamp had such a fear of  the coming day, for it knew that it should then be carried to the  town-hall for the first time, and examined by the authorities of the  city, who should decide if it could be used or not. It would then be  determined whether it should be sent out to one of the suburbs, or in  to the country to a manufactory; perhaps it would be sent direct to  the ironfounder's and be re-cast; in that case it could certainly be  all sorts of things: but it pained it not to know whether it would  then retain the remembrance of its having been a street-lamp.    However it might be, whether it went into the country or not, it would  be separated from the watchman and his wife, whom it regarded as its  family. It became a street-lamp when he became watchman. His wife was  a very fine woman at that time; it was only in the evening when she  went past the lamp that she looked at it, but never in the daytime.  Now, on the contrary, of late years, as they had all three grown  old,--the watchman, his wife, and the lamp,--the wife had always  attended to it, polished it up, and put oil in it. They were honest  folks that married couple, they had not cheated the lamp of a single  drop. It was its last evening in the street, and to-morrow it was to  be taken to the town-hall; these were two dark thoughts in the lamp,  and so one can know how it burnt. But other thoughts also passed  through it; there was so much it had seen, so much it had a desire  for, perhaps just as much as the whole of the city authorities; but it  didn't say so, for it was a well-behaved old lamp--it would not insult  any one, least of all its superiors. It remembered so much, and now  and then the flames within it blazed up,--it was as if it had a  feeling of--yes, they will also remember me! There was now that  handsome young man--but that is many years since,--he came with a  letter, it was on rose-colored paper; so fine--so fine! and with a  gilt edge; it was so neatly written, it was a lady's hand; he read it  twice, and he kissed it, and he looked up to me with his two bright  eyes--they said, \"I am the happiest of men!\" Yes, only he and I knew  what stood in that first letter from his beloved.    I also remember two other eyes--it is strange how one's thoughts fly  about!--there was a grand funeral here in the street, the beautiful  young wife lay in the coffin on the velvet-covered funeral car; there  were so many flowers and wreaths, there were so many torches burning,  that I was quite forgotten--out of sight; the whole footpath was  filled with persons; they all followed in the procession; but when the  torches were out of sight, and I looked about, there stood one who  leaned against my post and wept. I shall never forget those two  sorrowful eyes that looked into me. Thus there passed many thoughts  through the old street-lamp, which this evening burnt for the last  time. The sentinel who is relieved from his post knows his successor,  and can say a few words to him, but the lamp knew not its successor;  and yet it could have given him a hint about rain and drizzle, and how  far the moon shone on the footpath, and from what corner the wind  blew.    Now, there stood three on the kerb-stone; they had presented  themselves before the lamp, because they thought it was the  street-lamp who gave away the office; the one of these three was a  herring's head, for it shines in the dark, and it thought that it  could be of great service, and a real saving of oil, if it came to be  placed on the lamp-post. The other was a piece of touchwood, which  also shines, and always more than a stock-fish; besides, it said so  itself, it was the last piece of a tree that had once been the pride  of the forest. The third was a glow-worm; but where it had come from  the lamp could not imagine; but the glow-worm was there, and it also  shone, but the touchwood and the herring's head took their oaths that  it only shone at certain times, and therefore it could never be taken  into consideration.    The old lamp said that none of them shone well enough to be a  street-lamp; but not one of them thought so; and as they heard that it  was not the lamp itself that gave away the office, they said that it  was a very happy thing, for that it was too infirm and broken down to  be able to choose.    At the same moment the wind came from the street corner, it whistled  through the cowl of the old lamp, and said to it, \"What is it that I  hear, are you going away to-morrow? Is it the last evening I shall  meet you here? Then you shall have a present!--now I will blow up your  brain-box so that you shall not only remember, clearly and distinctly,  what you have seen and heard, but when anything is told or read in  your presence, you shall be so clear-headed that you will also see  it.\"    \"That is certainly much!\" said the old street-lamp; \"I thank you much;  if I be only not re-cast.\"    \"It will not happen yet awhile,\" said the wind; \"and now I will blow  up your memory; if you get more presents than that you may have quite  a pleasant old age.\"    \"If I be only not re-cast,\" said the lamp; \"or can you then assure me  my memory?\"    \"Old lamp, be reasonable!\" said the wind, and then it blew. The moon  came forth at the same time. \"What do you give?\" asked the wind.    \"I give nothing!\" said the moon; \"I am waning, and the lamps have  never shone for me, but I have shone for the lamps.\"* So the moon went  behind the clouds again, for it would not be plagued. A drop of rain  then fell straight down on the lamp's cowl, it was like a drop of  water from the eaves, but the drop said that it came from the grey  clouds, and was also a present,---and perhaps the best of all. \"I  penetrate into you, so that you have the power, if you wish it, in one  night to pass over to rust, so that you may fall in pieces and become  dust.\" But the lamp thought this was a poor present, and the wind  thought the same. \"Is there no better--is there no better?\" it  whistled, as loud as it could. A shooting-star then fell, it shone in  a long stripe.    ------    * It is the custom in Denmark, and one deserving the severest censure,  that, on those nights in which the moon shines; or, according to  almanac authority, ought to shine, the street lamps are not lighted;  so that, as it too frequently happens, when the moon is overclouded,  or on rainy evenings when she is totally obscured, the streets are for  the most part in perfect darkness. This petty economy is called \"the  magistrates' light,\" they having the direction of the lighting,  paving, and cleansing of towns.    The same management may be met with in some other countries besides  Denmark.    ------    \"What was that?\" exclaimed the herring's head; \"did not a star fall  right down? I think it went into the lamp! Well, if persons who stand  so high seek the office, we may as well take ourselves off.\"    And it did so, and the others did so too; but the old lamp shone all  at once so singularly bright.    \"That was a fine present!\" it said; \"the bright stars which I have  always pleased myself so much about, and which shine so  beautifully,--as I really have never been able to shine, although it  was my whole aim and endeavor,--have noticed me, a poor old-lamp, and  sent one down with a present to me, which consists of that quality,  that everything I myself remember and see quite distinctly, shall also  be seen by those I am fond of; and that is, above all, a true  pleasure, for what one cannot share with others is but a half  delight.\"    \"It is a very estimable thought,\" said the wind; \"but you certainly  don't know that there must be wax-candles; for unless a wax-candle be  lighted in you there are none of the others that will be able "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#8)"],[1,"his valuable  ascent in 1845. He reached the eastern summit, which is only a few feet  lower than the western, and only a few minutes' walk from it, but was  obliged to return at once on account of the threatening weather. When he  produced his companions as witnesses before the authorities at Erivan,  they turned against him, and solemnly swore that at the point which they  had reached a higher peak stood between them and the western horizon. This  strengthened the Armenian belief in the inaccessibility of Ararat, which  was not dissipated when the Russian military engineer, General Chodzko,  and an English party made the ascent in 1856. Nor were their prejudiced  minds convinced by the ascent of Mr. Bryce twenty years later, in 1876.  Two days after his ascent, that gentleman paid a visit to the Armenian  monastery at Echmiadzin, and was presented to the archimandrite as the  Englishman who had just ascended to the top of \"Masis.\" \"No,\" said the  ecclesiastical dignitary; \"that cannot be. No one has ever been there. It  is impossible.\" Mr. Bryce himself says: \"I am persuaded that there is not  a person living within sight of Ararat, unless it be some exceptionally  educated Russian official at Erivan, who believes that any human foot,  since Father Noah's, has trodden that sacred summit. So much stronger is  faith than sight; or rather so much stronger is prejudice than evidence.\"    We had expected, on our arrival in Bayazid, to find in waiting for us a  Mr. Richardson, an American missionary from Erzerum. Two years later, on  our arrival home, we received a letter explaining that on his way from Van  he had been captured by Kurdish brigands, and held a prisoner until  released through the intervention of the British consul at Erzerum. It was  some such fate as this that was predicted for us, should we ever attempt  the ascent of Mount Ararat through the lawless Kurdish tribes upon its  slopes. Our first duty, therefore, was to see the mutessarif of Bayazid,  to whom we bore a letter from the Grand Vizir of Turkey, in order to  ascertain what protection and assistance he would be willing to give us.  We found with him a Circassian who belonged to the Russian camp at  Sardarbulakh, on the Ararat pass, and who had accompanied General Chodzko  on his ascent of the mountain in 1856. Both he and the mutessarif thought  an ascent so early in the year was impossible; that we ought not to think  of such a thing until two months later. It was now six weeks earlier than  the time of General Chodzko's ascent (August 11 to 18), then the earliest  on record. They both strongly recommended the northwestern slope as being  more gradual. This is the one that Parrot ascended in 1829, and where  Abich was repulsed on his third attempt. Though entirely inexperienced in  mountain-climbing, we ourselves thought that the southeast slope, the one  taken by General Chodzko, the English party, and Mr. Bryce, was far more  feasible for a small party. One thing, however, the mutessarif was  determined upon: we must not approach the mountain without an escort of  Turkish zaptiehs, as an emblem of government protection. Besides, he would  send for the chief of the Ararat Kurds, and endeavor to arrange with him  for our safety and guidance up the mountain. As we emerged into the  streets an Armenian professor gravely shook his head. \"Ah,\" said he, \"you  will never do it.\" Then dropping his voice, he told us that those other  ascents were all fictitious; that the summit of \"Masis\" had never yet been  reached except by Noah; and that we were about to attempt what was an  utter impossibility.    In Bayazid we could not procure even proper wood for alpenstocks. Willow  branches, two inches thick, very dry and brittle, were the best we could  obtain. Light as this wood is, the alpenstocks weighed at least seven  pounds apiece when the iron hooks and points were riveted on at the ends  by the native blacksmith, for whom we cut paper patterns, of the exact  size, for everything we wanted. We next had large nails driven into the  souls of our shoes by a local shoemaker, who made them for us by hand out  of an old English file, and who wanted to pull them all out again because  we would not pay him the exorbitant price he demanded. In buying  provisions for the expedition, we spent three hours among the half  dilapidated bazaars of the town, which have never been repaired since the  disastrous Russian bombardment. The most difficult task, perhaps, in our  work of preparation was to strike a bargain with an Armenian muleteer to  carry our food and baggage up the mountain on his two little donkeys.      [Illustration: WHERE THE \"ZAPTIEHS\" WERE NOT A NUISANCE.]    Evening came, and no word from either the mutessarif or the Kurdish chief.  Although we were extremely anxious to set off on the expedition before bad  weather set in, we must not be in a hurry, for the military governor of  Karakillissa was now the guest of the mutessarif, and it would be an  interference with his social duties to try to see him until after his  guest had departed. On the morrow we were sitting in our small dingy room  after dinner, when a cavalcade hastened up to our inn, and a few minutes  later we were surprised to hear ourselves addressed in our native tongue.  Before us stood a dark-complexioned young man, and at his side a small  wiry old gentleman, who proved to be a native Austrian Tyrolese, who  followed the profession of an artist in Paris. He was now making his way  to Erivan, in Russia, on a sight-seeing tour from Trebizond. His companion  was a Greek from Salonica, who had lived for several years in London,  whence he had departed not many weeks before, for Teheran, Persia. These  two travelers had met in Constantinople, and the young Greek, who could  speak English, Greek, and Turkish, had been acting as interpreter for the  artist. They had heard of the \"devil's carts\" when in Van, and had made  straight for our quarters on their arrival in Bayazid. At this point they  were to separate. When we learned that the old gentleman (Ignaz Raffl by  name) was a member of an Alpine club and an experienced mountain-climber,  we urged him to join in the ascent. Though his shoulders were bent by the  cares and troubles of sixty-three years, we finally induced him to  accompany our party. Kantsa, the Greek, reluctantly agreed to do likewise,  and proved to be an excellent interpreter, but a poor climber.    The following morning we paid the mutessarif a second visit, with Kantsa  as interpreter. Inasmuch as the Kurdish chief had not arrived, the  mutessarif said he would make us bearers of a letter to him. Two zaptiehs  were to accompany us in the morning, while others were to go ahead and  announce our approach.    At ten minutes of eleven, on the morning of the second of July, our small  cavalcade, with the two exasperating donkeys at the head laden with mats,  bags of provisions, extra clothing, alpenstocks, spiked shoes, and coils  of stout rope, filed down the streets of Bayazid, followed by a curious  rabble. As Bayazid lies hidden behind a projecting spur of the mountains  we could obtain no view of the peak itself until we had tramped some  distance out on the plain. Its huge giant mass broke upon us all at once.  We stopped and looked--and looked again. No mountain-peak we have seen,  though several have been higher, has ever inspired the feeling which  filled us when we looked for the first time upon towering Ararat. We had  not proceeded far before we descried a party of Kurdish horsemen  approaching from the mountain. Our zaptiehs advanced rather cautiously to  meet them, with rifles thrown across the pommels of their saddles. After a  rather mysterious parley, our zaptiehs signaled that all was well. On  coming up, they reported that these horsemen belonged to the party that  was friendly to the Turkish government. The Kurds, they said, were at this  time divided among themselves, a portion of them having adopted  conciliatory measures with the government, and the rest holding aloof. But  we rather considered their little performance as a scheme to extort a  little more baksheesh for their necessary presence.      [Illustration: READY FOR THE START.]    The plain we were now on was drained by a tributary of the Aras River, a  small stream reached after two hours' steady tramping. From the bordering  hillocks we emerged in a short time upon another vast plateau, which  stretched far away in a gentle rise to the base of the mountain itself.  Near by we discovered a lone willow-tree, the only one in the whole sweep  of our vision, under the gracious foliage of which sat a band of Kurds,  retired from the heat of the afternoon sun, their horses feeding on some  swamp grass near at hand. Attracted by this sign of water, we drew near,  and found a copious spring. A few words from the zaptiehs, who had  advanced among them, seemed to put the Kurds at their ease, though they  did not by any means appease their curiosity. They invited us to partake  of their frugal lunch of ekmek and goat's-milk cheese. Our clothes and  baggage were discussed piece by piece, with loud expressions of merriment,  until one of us arose, and, stealing behind the group, snapped the camera.  \"What was that?\" said a burly member of the group, as he looked round with  scowling face at his companions. \"Yes; what was that?\" they echoed, and  then made a rush for the manipulator of the black box, which they  evidently took for some instrument of the black art. The photographer  stood serenely innocent, and winked at the zaptieh to give the proper  explanation. He was equal to the occasion. \"That,\" said he, \"is an  instrument for taking time by the sun.\" At this the box went the round,  each one gazing intently into the lens, then scratching his head, and  casting a bewildered look at his nearest neighbor. We noticed that every  one about us was armed with knife, revolver, and Martini"]]]
