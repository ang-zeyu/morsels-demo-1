I believe I may be so  bold to say, that divers Professors do not even understand their own  Tongue, much less the _Latin_.[52]    Sec. 8. Let him continually, by himself, use his Voice to a Velocity of  Motion, if he thinks to have a Command over it, and that he may not go  by the Name of a pathetick Singer.    Sec. 9. Let him not omit frequently to put forth, and to stop, the Voice,  that it may always be at his Command.    Sec. 10. Let him repeat his Lesson at Home, till he knows it perfectly; and  with a local Memory let him retain it, to save his Master the Trouble of  Teaching, and himself of studying it over again.    Sec. 11. Singing requires so strict an Application, that one must study  with the Mind, when one cannot with the Voice.    Sec. 12. The unwearied Study of Youth is sure to overcome all Obstacles  that oppose, though Defects were suck'd in with our Mother's Milk. This  Opinion of mine is subject to strong Objections; however, Experience  will defend it, provided he corrects himself in time. But if he delays  it, the older he grows the more his Faults will increase.    Sec. 13. Let him hear as much as he can the most celebrated Singers, and  likewise the most excellent instrumental Performers; because, from the  Attention in hearing them, one reaps more Advantage than from any  Instruction whatsoever.    Sec. 14. Let him endeavour to copy from Both, that he may insensibly, by  the Study of others, get a good Taste. This advice, though extremely  useful to a Student, is notwithstanding infinitely prejudicial to a  Singer, as I shall shew in its proper Place[53].    Sec. 15. Let him often sing the most agreable Compositions of the best  Authors, and accustom the Ear to that which pleases. I'd have a Student  know, that by the abovementioned Imitations, and by the Idea of good  Compositions, the Taste in Time becomes Art, and Art Nature.    Sec. 16. Let him learn to accompany himself, if he is ambitious of singing  well. The Harpsichord is a great Incitement to Study, and by it we  continually improve in our Knowledge. The evident Advantage arising to  the Singer from that lovely Instrument, makes it superfluous to say  more on that Head. Moreover, it often happens to one who cannot play,  that without the Help of another he cannot be heard, and is thereby to  his Shame obliged to deny the Commands of those whom it would be to his  Advantage to obey.    Sec. 17. Till a Singer pleases himself, it is certain he cannot please  others. Therefore consider, if some Professors of no small Skill have  not this Pleasure for want of sufficient Application, what must the  Scholar do? Study,--and study again, and not be satisfied.    Sec. 18. I am almost of Opinion, that all Study and Endeavours to sing are  infallibly vain, if not accompanied with some little Knowledge of  Counterpoint. One, who knows how to compose, can account for what he  does, and he, who has not the same Light, works in the Dark, not knowing  how to sing without committing Errors. The most famous _Ancients_ know  the intrinsick Value of this Precept from the Effects. And a good  Scholar ought to imitate them, without considering whether this Lesson  be according to the _Mode_ or not For though, in these Days, one now and  then hears admirable Performances, proceeding from a natural Taste, yet  they are all done by Chance; but where that Taste is wanting, if they  are not execrable, at least they will be very bad: For Fortune not being  always at their Command, they cannot be sure to agree, neither with Time  nor Harmony. This Knowledge, although requisite, I would not however  advise a Scholar to give himself up to an intense Application, it being  certain, I should teach him the readiest way to lose his Voice, but I  exhort him only to learn the principal Rules, that he may not be quite  in the Dark.[54]    Sec. 19. To study much, and preserve a Voice in its full Beauty, are two  Things almost incompatible; there is between them such a sort of Amity,  as cannot last without being prejudicial to the one or the other.  However, if one reflects, that Perfection in a Voice is a Gift of  Nature, and in Art a painful Acquisition, it will indeed be allowed,  that this latter excels in Merit, and more deserves our Praise.    Sec. 20. Whoever studies, let him look for what is most excellent, and let  him look for it wherever it is, without troubling himself whether it be  in the Stile of fifteen or twenty Years ago, or in that of these Days;  for all Ages have their good and bad Productions. It is enough to find  out the best, and profit by them.    Sec. 21. To my irreparable Misfortune, I am old; but were I young, I would  imitate as much as possibly I could the _Cantabile_ of those who are  branded with the opprobrious Name of _Ancients_; and the _Allegro_ of  those who enjoy the delightful Appellation of _Moderns_. Though my Wish  is vain as to myself, it will be of Use to a prudent Scholar, who is  desirous to be expert in both Manners, which is the only way to arrive  at Perfection; but if one was to chuse, I should freely, without Fear of  being tax'd with Partiality, advise him to attach himself to the Taste  of the first.[55]    Sec. 22. Each Manner of Singing hath a different Degree of Eminence; the  Nervous and Strong is distinguished from the Puerile and Weak, as is the  Noble from the Vulgar.    Sec. 23. A Student must not hope for Applause, if he has not an utter  Abhorrence of Ignorance.    Sec. 24. Whoever does not aspire to the first Rank, begins already to give  up the second, and by little and little will rest contented with the  lowest.    Sec. 25. If, out of a particular Indulgence to the sex, so many female  Singers have the Graces set down in Writing, one that studies to become  a good Singer should not follow the Example; whoever accustoms himself  to have Things put in his Mouth, will have no Invention, and becomes a  Slave to his Memory.    Sec. 26. If the Scholar should have any Defects, of the Nose, the Throat,  or of the Ear, let him never sing but when the Master is by, or somebody  that understands the Profession, in order to correct him, otherwise he  will get an ill Habit, past all Remedy.    Sec. 27. When he studies his Lesson at Home, let him sometimes sing before  a Looking-glass, not to be enamoured with his own Person, but to avoid  those convulsive Motions of the Body, or of the Face (for so I call the  Grimaces of an affected Singer) which, when once they have took Footing,  never leave him.    Sec. 28. The best Time for Study is with the rising of the Sun; but those,  who are obliged to study, must employ all their Time which can be spared  from their other necessary Affairs.    Sec. 29. After a long Exercise, and the Attainment of a true Intonation, of  a _Messa di Voce_, of _Shakes_, of _Divisions_, and _Recitative_ well  expressed, if the Scholar perceives that his Master cannot teach him all  the Perfection of Execution required in the more refined Art of singing  the Airs, or if he cannot always be by his Side, then will he begin to  be sensible of the Need he has of that Study, in which the best Singer  in the World is still a Learner, and must be his own Master. Supposing  this Reflection just, I advise him for his first Insight, to read the  following Chapter, in order thereby to reap greater Advantage from those  that can sing the _Airs_, and teach to sing them.          CHAP. VII.    _Of_ Airs.      If whoever introduced the Custom of repeating the first Part of the  _Air_ (which is called _Da Capo_) did it out of a Motive to show the  Capacity of the Singer, in varying the Repetition, the Invention cannot  be blam'd by Lovers of Musick; though in respect of the Words it is  sometimes an Impropriety.[56]    Sec. 2. By the _Ancients_ beforementioned, _Airs_ were sung in three  different Manners; for the Theatre, the Stile was lively and various;  for the Chamber, delicate and finish'd; and for the Church, moving and  grave. This Difference, to very many _Moderns_, is quite unknown.    Sec. 3. A Singer is under the greatest Obligation to the Study of the  _Airs_; for by them he gains or loses his Reputation. To the acquiring  this valuable, Art, a few verbal Lessons cannot suffice; nor would it be  of any great Profit to the Scholar, to have a great Number of _Airs_, in  which a Thousand of the most exquisite Passages of different Sorts were  written down: For they would not serve for all Purposes, and there would  always be wanting that Spirit which accompanies extempore Performances,  and is preferable to all servile Imitations. All (I think) that can be  said, is to recommend to him an attentive Observation of the Art, with  which the best Singers regulate themselves to the Bass, whereby he will  become acquainted with their Perfections, and improve by them. In order  to make his Observations with the greater Exactness, let him follow the  Example of a Friend of mine, who never went to an Opera without a Copy  of all the Songs, and, observing the finest Graces, confin'd to the most  exact Time of the Movement of the Bass, he made thereby a great  Progress.[57]    Sec. 4. Among the Things worthy of Consideration, the first to be taken  Notice of, is the Manner in which all _Airs_ divided into three Parts  are to be sung. In the first they require nothing but the simplest  Ornaments, of a good Taste and few, that the Composition may remain  simple, plain, and pure; in the second they expect, that to this Purity  some artful Graces[58] be added, by which the Judicious may hear, that  the Ability of the Singer is greater; and, in, repeating the _Air_, he  that does not vary it for the better, is no great Master.    Sec. 5. Let a Student therefore accustom himself to repeat them always  differently, for, if I mistake not, one that abounds in Invention,  though a moderate Singer, deserves much more Esteem, than a better who  is barren of it;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#8)"],[1,"the good quality of the  troops engaged: if not as soldiers, at all events as men. It proved  that the war, unlike the battle, would not be fought by special  constables, some of whom first fired their rifles when their target  was firing back at them. It brought one great leader--Stonewall  Jackson--into fame. Above all, it profoundly affected the popular  points of view, both North and South. In the South there was undue  elation, followed by the absurd belief that one Southerner could  beat two Northerners any day and that the North would now back  down _en masse_, as its army had from the Henry Hill. A dangerous  slackening of military preparation was the unavoidable result.  In the North, on the other hand, a good many people began to see  the difference between armed mobs and armies; and the thorough  Unionists, led by the wise and steadfast Lincoln, braced themselves  for real war.          CHAPTER II.    THE COMBATANTS    No map can show the exact dividing line between the actual combatants  of North and South. Eleven States seceded: Virginia, the Carolinas,  Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas,  and Arkansas. But the mountain folk of western Virginia and eastern  Tennessee were strong Unionists; and West Virginia became a State  while the war was being fought. On the other hand, the four border  States, though officially Federal under stress of circumstances,  were divided against themselves. In Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri,  and Kansas, many citizens took the Southern side. Maryland would  have gone with the South if it had not been for the presence of  overwhelming Northern sea-power and the absence of any good land  frontier of her own. Kentucky remained neutral for several months.  Missouri was saved for the Union by those two resourceful and determined  men, Lyon and Blair. Kansas, though preponderantly Unionist, had  many Confederates along its southern boundary. On the whole the  Union gained greatly throughout the borderlands as the war went on;  and the remaining Confederate hold on the border people was more  than counterbalanced by the Federal hold on those in the western  parts of old Virginia and the eastern parts of Tennessee. Among  the small seafaring population along the Southern coast there were  also some strongly Union men.    Counting out Northern Confederates and Southern Federals as canceling  each other, so far as effective fighting was concerned a comparison  made between the North and South along the line of actual secession  reveals the one real advantage the South enjoyed all through--an  overwhelming party in favor of the war. When once the die was cast  there was certainly not a tenth of the Southern whites who did not  belong to the war party; and the peace party always had to hold  its tongue. The Southerners formed simpler and far more homogeneous  communities of the old long-settled stock, and were more inclined  to act together when once their feelings were profoundly stirred.    The Northern communities, on the other hand, being far more complex  and far less homogeneous, were plagued with peace parties that  grew like human weeds, clogging the springs of action everywhere.  There were immigrants new to the country and therefore not inclined  to take risks for a cause they had not learned to make their own.  There were also naturalized, and even American-born, aliens, aliens  in speech, race, thought, and every way of life. Then there were the  oppositionists of different kinds, who would not support any war  government, however like a perfect coalition it might be. Among these  were some Northerners who did business with the South, especially  the men who financed the cotton and tobacco crops. Others, again,  were those loose-tongued folk who think any vexed question can be  settled by unlimited talk. Next came those \"defeatist\" cranks who  always think their own side must be wrong, and who are of no more  practical use than the out-and-out \"pacifists\" who think everybody  wrong except themselves. Finally, there were those slippery folk who  try to evade all public duty, especially when it smacks of danger.  These skulkers flourish best in large and complex populations,  where they may even masquerade as patriots of the kind so well  described by Lincoln when he said how often he had noticed that  the men who were loudest in proclaiming their readiness to shed  their last drop of blood were generally the most careful not to  shed the first.    Many of these fustian heroes formed the mushroom secret societies  that played their vile extravaganza right under the shadow of the  real tragedy of war. Worse still, not content with the abracadabra  of their silly oaths, the busybody members made all the mischief  they could during Lincoln's last election. Worst of all, they not  only tried their hands at political assassination in the North but  they lured many a gallant Confederate to his death by promising to  rise in their might for a \"Free Northwest\" the moment the Southern  troopers should appear. Needless to say, not a single one of the whole  bombastic band of cowards stirred a finger to help the Confederate  troopers who rode to their doom on Morgan's Raid through Indiana and  Ohio. The peace party wore a copper as a badge, and so came to be known  as \"Copperheads,\" much to the disgust of its more inflated members,  who called themselves the Sons of Liberty. The war party, with a  better appreciation of how names and things should be connected,  used their own descriptive \"Copperhead\" in its appropriate meaning  of a poisonous snake in the grass behind.    The Indians would have preferred neutrality between the two kinds  of inevitably dispossessing whites. But neutrality was impossible  in what was then the Far West. Not ten thousand Indians fought  for both sides put together. On the whole they fought well as  skirmishers, though they rarely withstood shell fire, even when  their cover was good and their casualties small.    The ten times more numerous negroes were naturally a much more  serious factor. The North encouraged the employment of colored labor  corps and even colored soldiers, especially after Emancipation.  But the vast majority of negroes, whether slave or free, either  preferred or put up with their Southern masters, whom they generally  served faithfully enough either in military labor corps or on the  old plantations. As the colored population of the South was three  and a half millions this general fidelity was of great importance  to the forces in the field.    The total population of the United States in 1861 was about thirty-one  and a half millions. Of this total twenty-two and a half belonged to  the North and nine to the South. The grand total odds were therefore  five against two. The odds against the South rise to four against  one if the blacks are left out. There were twenty-two million whites  in the North against five and a half in the South. But to reach  the real fighting odds of three to one we must also eliminate the  peace parties, large in the North, small in the South. If we take  a tenth off the Southern whites and a third off the Northern grand  total we shall get the approximate war-party odds of three to one;  for these subtractions leave fifteen millions in the North against  only five in the South.    This gives the statistical key to the startling contrasts which  were so often noted by foreign correspondents at the time, and  which are still so puzzling in the absence of the key. The whole  normal life of the South was visibly changed by the war. But in  the North the inquiring foreigner could find, on one hand, the  most steadfast loyalty and heroic sacrifice, both in the Northern  armies and among their folks at home, while on the other he could  find a wholly different kind of life flaunting its most shameless  features in his face. The theaters were crowded. Profiteers abounded,  taking their pleasures with ravenous greed; for the best of their  blood-money would end with the war. Everywhere there was the same  fundamental difference between the patriots who carried on the war  and the parasites who hindered them. Of course the two-thirds who  made up the war party were not all saints or even perfect patriots.  Nor was the other third composed exclusively of wanton sinners. There  were, for instance, the genuine settlers whom the Union Government  encouraged to occupy the West, beyond the actual reach of war. But  the distinction still remains.    Though sorely hampered, the Union Government did, on the whole,  succeed in turning the vast and varied resources of the North against  the much smaller and less varied resources of the South. The North  held the machinery of national government, though with the loss of  a good quarter of the engineers. In agriculture of, all kinds both  North and South were very strong for purposes of peace. Each had  food in superabundance. But the trading strength of the South lay  in cotton and tobacco, neither of which could be turned into money  without going north or to sea. In finance the North was overwhelmingly  strong by comparison, more especially because Northern sea-power  shut off the South from all its foreign markets. In manufactures  the South could not compare at all. Northern factories alone could  not supply the armies. But finance and factories together could.  The Southern soldier looked to the battlefield and the raiding  of a base for supplying many of his most pressing needs in arms,  equipment, clothing, and even food--for Southern transport suffered  from many disabilities. Fierce wolfish cries would mingle with  the rebel yell in battle when the two sides closed. \"You've got  to leave your rations!\"--\"Come out of them clothes!\"--\"Take off  them boots, Yank!\"--\"Come on, blue bellies, we want them blankets!\"    It was the same in almost every kind of goods. The South made next  to none for herself and had to import from"]]]
