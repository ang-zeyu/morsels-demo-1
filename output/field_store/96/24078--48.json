In the centre he stops to eat his  dinner. Halfway from the centre to the west he stops to eat his supper.  He never fails to eat these three meals each day, and always stops at  the same points.    The sun wears a shirt of dressed deerskin, with leggings of the same  reaching to his thighs. The shirt and leggings are fringed. His  moccasins are also of deerskin and embroidered in yellow, red, and  turkis beads. He wears a kilt of deerskin, having a snake painted upon  it. He carries a bow and arrows, the quiver being of cougar skin,  hanging over his shoulder, and he holds his bow in his left hand and an  arrow in his right. He always wears the mask which protects him from the  sight of the people of Ha-arts.    At the top of the mask is an eagle plume with parrot plumes; an eagle  plume is at each side, and one at the bottom of the mask. The hair  around the head and face is red like fire, and when it moves and shakes  people cannot look closely at the mask. It is not intended that they  should observe closely, else they would know that instead of seeing the  sun they see only his mask.    The moon came to the upper world with the sun and he also wears a mask.    Each night the sun passes by the house of Sussistinnako, the spider, who  asks him, \"How are my children above? How many have died to-day? How  many have been born to-day?\" The sun lingers only long enough to answer  his questions. He then passes on to his house in the east.          The Foxes and the Sun  Yurok (near Klamath River, Cal.)    Once upon a time, the Foxes were angry with Sun. They held a council  about the matter. Then twelve Foxes were selected--twelve of the  bravest to catch Sun and tie him down. They made ropes of sinew; then  the twelve watched until the Sun, as he followed the downward trail in  the sky, touched the top of a certain hill. Then the Foxes caught Sun,  and tied him fast to the hill. But the Indians saw them, and they killed  the Foxes with arrows. Then they cut the sinews. But the Sun had burned  a great hole in the ground. The Indians know the story is true, because  they can see the hole which Sun burned.          The Theft of Fire  Karok (near Klamath River, Cal.)    There was no fire on earth and the Karoks were cold and miserable. Far  away to the east, hidden in a treasure box, was fire which Kareya had  made and given to two old hags, lest the Karoks should steal it. So  Coyote decided to steal fire for the Indians.    Coyote called a great council of the animals. After the council he  stationed a line from the land of the Karoks to the distant land where  the fire was kept. Lion was nearest the Fire Land, and Frog was nearest  the Karok land. Lion was strongest and Frog was weakest, and the other  animals took their places, according to the power given them by Man.    Then Coyote took an Indian with him and went to the hill top, but he hid  the Indian under the hill. Coyote went to the tepee of the hags. He  said, \"Good-evening.\" They replied, \"Good-evening.\"    Coyote said, \"It is cold out here. Can you let me sit by the fire?\" So  they let him sit by the fire. He was only a coyote. He stretched his  nose out along his forepaws and pretended to go to sleep, but he kept  the corner of one eye open watching. So he spent all night watching and  thinking, but he had no chance to get a piece of the fire.    The next morning Coyote held a council with the Indian. He told him when  he, Coyote, was within the tepee, to attack it. Then Coyote went back to  the fire. The hags let him in again. He was only a Coyote. But Coyote  stood close by the casket of fire. The Indian made a dash at the tepee.  The hags rushed out after him, and Coyote seized a fire brand in his  teeth and flew over the ground. The hags saw the sparks flying and gave  chase. But Coyote reached Lion, who ran with it to Grizzly Bear. Grizzly  Bear ran with it to Cinnamon Bear; he ran with it to Wolf, and at last  the fire came to Ground-Squirrel. Squirrel took the brand and ran so  fast that his tail caught fire. He curled it up over his back, and  burned the black spot in his shoulders. You can see it even to-day.  Squirrel came to Frog, but Frog couldn't run. He opened his mouth wide  and swallowed the fire. Then he jumped but the hags caught his tail.  Frog jumped again, but the hags kept his tail. That is why Frogs have no  tail, even to this day. Frog swam under water, and came up on a pile of  driftwood. He spat out the fire into the dry wood, and that is why there  is fire in dry wood even to-day. When an Indian rubs two pieces  together, the fire comes out.          The Theft of Fire  Sia (New Mexico)    Along, long time ago, the people became tired of feeding on grass, like  deer and wild animals, and they talked together how fire might be found.  The Ti-amoni said, \"Coyote is the best man to steal fire from the world  below,\" so he sent for Coyote.    When Coyote came, the Ti-amoni said, \"The people wish for fire. We are  tired of feeding on grass. You must go to the world below and bring the  fire.\"    Coyote said, \"It is well, father. I will go.\"    So Coyote slipped stealthily to the house of Sussistinnako. It was the  middle of the night. Snake, who guarded the first door, was asleep, and  he slipped quickly and quietly by. Cougar, who guarded the second door,  was asleep, and Coyote slipped by. Bear, who guarded the third door, was  also sleeping. At the fourth door, Coyote found the guardian of the fire  asleep. Slipping through into the room of Sussistinnako, he found him  also sleeping.    Coyote quickly lighted the cedar brand which was attached to his tail  and hurried out. Spider awoke, just enough to know some one was leaving  the room. \"Who is there?\" he cried. Then he called, \"Some one has been  here.\" But before he could waken the sleeping Bear and Cougar and Snake,  Coyote had almost reached the upper world.          The Earth-Hardening After the Flood  Sia (New Mexico)    After the flood, the Sia returned to Ha-arts, the earth. They came  through an opening in the far north. After they had remained at their  first village a year, they wished to pass on, but the earth was very  moist and Utset was puzzled how to harden it.    Utset called Cougar. She said, \"Have you any medicine to harden the road  so that we may pass over it?\" Cougar replied, \"I will try, mother.\" But  after going a short distance over the road, he sank to his shoulders in  the wet earth. He returned much afraid and told Utset that he could go  no farther.    Then she sent for Bear. She said, \"Have you any medicine to harden the  road?\" Bear started out, but he sank to his shoulders, and returned  saying, \"I can do nothing.\"    Then Utset called Badger, and he tried. She called Shrew, and he failed.  She called Wolf, and he failed.    Then Utset returned to the lower world and asked Sussistinnako what she  could do to harden the earth so that her people might travel over it. He  asked, \"Have you no medicine to make the earth firm? Have you asked  Cougar and Wolf, Bear and Badger and Wolf to use their medicines to  harden the earth?\"    Utset said, \"I have tried all these.\"    Then Sussistinnako said, \"Others will understand.\" He told her to have a  woman of the Kapina (spider) clan try to harden the earth.    When the woman arrived, Utset said, \"My mother, Sussistinnako tells me  the Kapina society understand how to harden the earth.\"    The woman said, \"I do not know how to make the earth hard.\"    Three times Utset asked the woman about hardening the earth, and three  times the woman said, \"I do not know.\" The fourth time the woman said,  \"Well, I guess I know. I will try.\"    So she called together the members of the Spider society, the Kapina,  and said,    \"Our mother, Sussistinnako, bids us work for her and harden the earth so  that the people may pass over it.\" The spider woman first made a road of  fine cotton which she produced from her own body, and suspended it a few  feet above the earth. Then she told the people they could travel on  that. But the people were afraid to trust themselves to such a frail  road.    Then Utset said, \"I wish a man and not a woman of the Spider society to  work for me.\"    Then he came. He threw out a charm of wood, latticed so it could be  expanded or contracted. When it was extended it reached to the middle of  the earth. He threw it to the south, to the east, and to the west; then  he threw it toward the people in the north.    So the earth was made firm that the people might travel upon it.    Soon after Utset said, \"I will soon leave you. I will, return to the  home from which I came.\"    Then she selected a man of the Corn clan. She said to him, \"You will be  known as Ti-amoni (arch-ruler). You will be to my people as myself. You  will pass with them over the straight road. I give to you all my wisdom,  my thoughts, my heart, and all. I fill your mind with my mind.\"    He replied: \"It is well, mother. I will do as you say.\"          The Origins of the Totems and of Names  Zuni (New Mexico)    Now the Twain Beloved and the priest-fathers gathered in council for the  naming and selection of man-groups and creature-kinds, and things. So  they called the people of the southern space the Children of Summer, and  those who loved the sun most became the Sun people. Others who loved the  water became the Toad people, or Turtle people, or Frog people. Others  loved the seeds of the earth and became the Seed people, or the people  of the First-growing grass, or of the Tobacco. Those who loved warmth  were the Fire or Badger people. According to their natures they chose  their totems.    And so also did the People of Winter, or the People of the North. Some  were known as the Bear people, or the Coyote people, or Deer people;  others as the Crane people, Turkey people, or Grouse people.
