They listened to the hermit's words,  And all the guardians of the herds,  With suppliant hands together pressed,  This answer to the saint addressed:  \"The Angas' lord who bears the name  Of Lomapad, renowned by fame,  Bestowed these hamlets with their kine  And all their riches, as a sign  Of grace, on Rishyasring: and he  Vibhandak's son is said to be.\"  The hermit with exulting breast  The mighty will of fate confessed,  By meditation's eye discerned;  And cheerful to his home returned.      A stately ship, at early morn,  The hermit's son away had borne.  Loud roared the clouds, as on he sped,  The sky grew blacker overhead;  Till, as he reached the royal town,  A mighty flood of rain came down.  By the great rain the monarch's mind  The coming of his guest divined.  To meet the honoured youth he went,  And low to earth his head he bent.  With his own priest to lead the train,  He gave the gift high guests obtain.  And sought, with all who dwelt within  The city walls, his grace to win.  He fed him with the daintiest fare,  He served him with unceasing care,  And ministered with anxious eyes  Lest anger in his breast should rise;  And gave to be the Brahman's bride  His own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.      Thus loved and honoured by the king,  The glorious Brahman Rishyasring  Passed in that royal town his life  With Santa his beloved wife.\"          Canto X. Rishyasring Invited.      \"Again, O best of kings, give ear:  My saving words attentive hear,  And listen to the tale of old  By that illustrious Brahman told.  \"Of famed Ikshvaku's line shall spring  ('Twas thus he spoke) a pious king,  Named Dasaratha, good and great,  True to his word and fortunate.  He with the Angas' mighty lord  Shall ever live in sweet accord,  And his a daughter fair shall be,  Santa of happy destiny.  But Lomapad, the Angas' chief,  Still pining in his childless grief,  To Dasaratha thus shall say:  \"Give me thy daughter, friend, I pray,  Thy Santa of the tranquil mind,  The noblest one of womankind.\"      The father, swift to feel for woe,  Shall on his friend his child bestow;  And he shall take her and depart  To his own town with joyous heart.  The maiden home in triumph led,  To Rishyasring the king shall wed.  And he with loving joy and pride  Shall take her for his honoured bride.  And Dasaratha to a rite  That best of Brahmans shall invite    With supplicating prayer,  To celebrate the sacrifice  To win him sons and Paradise,(83)  That he will fain prepare.  From him the lord of men at length    The boon he seeks shall gain,  And see four sons of boundless strength    His royal line maintain.\"  \"Thus did the godlike saint of old    The will of fate declare,  And all that should befall unfold    Amid the sages there.  O Prince supreme of men, go thou,    Consult thy holy guide,  And win, to aid thee in thy vow,    This Brahman to thy side.\"  Sumantra's counsel, wise and good,    King Dasaratha heard,  Then by Vasishtha's side he stood  And thus with him conferred:  \"Sumantra counsels thus: do thou  My priestly guide, the plan allow.\"    Vasishtha gave his glad consent,  And forth the happy monarch went  With lords and servants on the road  That led to Rishyasring's abode.  Forests and rivers duly past,  He reached the distant town at last  Of Lomapad the Angas' king,  And entered it with welcoming.  On through the crowded streets he came,  And, radiant as the kindled flame,  He saw within the monarch's house  The hermit's son most glorious.  There Lomapad, with joyful breast,    To him all honour paid,  For friendship for his royal guest    His faithful bosom swayed.  Thus entertained with utmost care  Seven days, or eight, he tarried there,  And then that best of men thus broke  His purpose to the king, and spoke:  \"O King of men, mine ancient friend,    (Thus Dasaratha prayed)  Thy Santa with her husband send    My sacrifice to aid.\"  Said he who ruled the Angas, Yea,    And his consent was won:  And then at once he turned away    To warn the hermit's son.  He told him of their ties beyond  Their old affection's faithful bond:  \"This king,\" he said, \"from days of old  A well beloved friend I hold.  To me this pearl of dames he gave  From childless woe mine age to save,  The daughter whom he loved so much,  Moved by compassion's gentle touch.  In him thy Santas father see:  As I am even so is he.  For sons the childless monarch yearns:  To thee alone for help he turns.  Go thou, the sacred rite ordain  To win the sons he prays to gain:  Go, with thy wife thy succour lend,  And give his vows a blissful end.\"    The hermit's son with quick accord  Obeyed the Angas' mighty lord,  And with fair Santa at his side  To Dasaratha's city hied.  Each king, with suppliant hands upheld,    Gazed on the other's face:  And then by mutual love impelled    Met in a close embrace.  Then Dasaratha's thoughtful care,    Before he parted thence,  Bade trusty servants homeward bear    The glad intelligence:  \"Let all the town be bright and gay    With burning incense sweet;  Let banners wave, and water lay    The dust in every street.\"  Glad were the citizens to learn  The tidings of their lord's return,  And through the city every man  Obediently his task began.  And fair and bright Ayodhya showed,  As following his guest he rode  Through the full streets where shell and drum  Proclaimed aloud the king was come.  And all the people with delight    Kept gazing on their king,  Attended by that youth so bright,    The glorious Rishyasring.  When to his home the king had brought    The hermit's saintly son,  He deemed that all his task was wrought,    And all he prayed for won.  And lords who saw that stranger dame    So beautiful to view,  Rejoiced within their hearts, and came    And paid her honour too.  There Rishyasring passed blissful days,  Graced like the king with love and praise  And shone in glorious light with her,  Sweet Santa, for his minister,  As Brahma's son Vasishtha, he  Who wedded Saint Arundhati.(84)          Canto XI. The Sacrifice Decreed.      The Dewy Season(85) came and went;    The spring returned again:  Then would the king, with mind intent,    His sacrifice ordain.  He came to Rishyasring, and bowed    To him of look divine,  And bade him aid his offering vowed    For heirs, to save his line.  Nor would the youth his aid deny:    He spake the monarch fair,  And prayed him for that rite so high    All requisites prepare.  The king to wise Sumantra cried    Who stood aye ready near;  \"Go summon quick each holy guide,    To counsel and to hear.\"  Obedient to his lord's behest    Away Sumantra sped,  And brought Vasishtha and the rest,    In Scripture deeply read.  Suyajna, Vamadeva came,    Javali, Kasyap's son,  And old Vasishtha, dear to fame,    Obedient every one.  King Dasaratha met them there    And duly honoured each,  And spoke in pleasant words his fair    And salutary speech:  \"In childless longing doomed to pine,  No happiness, O lords, is mine.  So have I for this cause decreed  To slay the sacrificial steed.  Fain would I pay that offering high  Wherein the horse is doomed to die,  With Rishyasring his aid to lend,  And with your glory to befriend.\"    With loud applause each holy man  Received his speech, approved the plan,  And, by the wise Vasishtha led,  Gave praises to the king, and said:  \"The sons thou cravest shalt thou see,  Of fairest glory, born to thee,  Whose holy feelings bid thee take  This righteous course for offspring's sake.\"  Cheered by the ready praise of those  Whose aid he sought, his spirits rose,  And thus the king his speech renewed  With looks of joy and gratitude:  \"Let what the coming rites require  Be ready as the priests desire,  And let the horse, ordained to bleed,  With fitting guard and priest, be freed,(86)  Yonder on Sarju's northern side  The sacrificial ground provide;  And let the saving rites, that naught  Ill-omened may occur, be wrought.  The offering I announce to-day  Each lord of earth may claim to pay,  Provided that his care can guard  The holy rite by flaws unmarred.  For wandering fiends, whose watchful spite  Waits eagerly to spoil each rite,  Hunting with keenest eye detect  The slightest slip, the least neglect;  And when the sacred work is crossed  The workman is that moment lost.  Let preparation due be made:    Your powers the charge can meet:  That so the noble rite be paid    In every point complete.\"  And all the Brahmans answered, Yea,    His mandate honouring,  And gladly promised to obey    The order of the king.  They cried with voices raised aloud:    \"Success attend thine aim!\"  Then bade farewell, and lowly bowed,    And hastened whence they came.  King Dasaratha went within,    His well loved wives to see:  And said: \"Your lustral rites begin,    For these shall prosper me.  A glorious offering I prepare  That precious fruit of sons may bear.\"  Their lily faces brightened fast    Those pleasant words to hear,  As lilies, when the winter's past,  In lovelier hues appear.          Canto XII. The Sacrifice Begun.      Again the spring with genial heat  Returning made the year complete.  To win him sons, without delay  His vow the king resolved to pay:  And to Vasishtha, saintly man,  In modest words this speech began:  \"Prepare the rite with all things fit  As is ordained in Holy Writ,  And keep with utmost care afar  Whate'er its sacred forms might mar.  Thou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,  Kind-hearted, and my friend beside;  So is it meet thou undertake  This heavy task for duty's sake.\"    Then he, of twice-born men the best,  His glad assent at once expressed:  \"Fain will I do whate'er may be  Desired, O honoured King, by thee.\"  To ancient priests he spoke, who, trained  In holy rites, deep skill had gained:  \"Here guards be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#8)"],[1,"a  half-embedded wreck.    She was watching a huddle of gulls clustered on the tip of a narrow,  sandy spit running out to the left. She turned at the sound of his  hurried foot-fall behind her. Her face paled slightly, and into the  depths of her eyes leapt a passionate, mesmeric glow that faded as  quickly as it came.    \"You see I have come back in spite of your command, Magdalen.\"    \"I do see it,\" she answered in a gravely troubled voice. \"You are a  madman who refuses to be warned.\"    \"Where are you going, Magdalen?\" She had loosened the rope from the  wreck.    \"I am going to row over to Chapel Point for salt. They think the boats  will come in tonight loaded with mackerel--look at them away out there  by the score--and salt will be needed.\"    \"Can you row so far alone?\"    \"Easily. I learned to row long ago--for a pastime then. Since coming  here I find it of great service to me.\"    She stepped lightly into the tiny shallop and picked up an oar. The  brilliant sunshine streamed about her, burnishing the rich tints of  her hair into ruddy gold. She balanced herself to the swaying of the  dory with the grace of a sea bird. The man looking at her felt his  brain reel.    \"Good-bye, Mr. Elliott.\"    For answer he sprang into the dory and, snatching an oar, pushed  against the old wreck with such energy that the dory shot out from the  shore like a foam bell. His sudden spring had set it rocking  violently. Magdalen almost lost her footing and caught blindly at his  arm. As her fingers closed on his wrist a thrill as of fire shot  through his every vein.    \"Why have you done this, Mr. Elliott? You must go back.\"    \"But I will not,\" he said masterfully, looking straight into her eyes  with an imperiousness that sat well upon him. \"I am going to row you  over to Chapel Point. I have the oars--I will be master this once, at  least.\"    For an instant her eyes flashed defiant protest, then drooped before  his. A sudden, hot blush crimsoned her pale face. His will had  mastered hers; the girl trembled from head to foot, and the proud,  sensitive, mouth quivered.    Into the face of the man watching her breathlessly flashed a  triumphant, passionate joy. He put out his hand and gently pushed her  down into the seat. Sitting opposite, he took up the oars and pulled  out over the sheet of sparkling blue water, through which at first the  bottom of white sand glimmered wavily but afterwards deepened to  translucent, dim depths of greenness.    His heart throbbed tumultuously. Once the thought of Marian drifted  across his mind like a chill breath of wind, but it was forgotten when  his eyes met Magdalen's.    \"Tell me about yourself, Magdalen,\" he said at last, breaking the  tremulous, charmed, sparkling silence.    \"There is nothing to tell,\" she answered with characteristic  straightforwardness. \"My life has been a very uneventful one. I have  never been rich, or very well educated, but--it used to be different  from now. I had some chance before--before Father died.\"    \"You must have found it very lonely and strange when you came here  first.\"    \"Yes. At first I thought I should die--but I do not mind it now. I  have made friends with the sea; it has taught me a great deal. There  is a kind of inspiration in the sea. When one listens to its  never-ceasing murmur afar out there, always sounding at midnight and  midday, one's soul goes out to meet Eternity. Sometimes it gives me so  much pleasure that it is almost pain.\"    She stopped abruptly.    \"I don't know why I am talking to you like this.\"    \"You are a strange girl, Magdalen. Have you no other companion than  the sea?\"    \"No. Why should I wish to have? I shall not be here long.\"    Elliott's face contracted with a spasm of pain.    \"You are not going away, Magdalen?\"    \"Yes--in the fall. I have my own living to earn, you know. I am very  poor. Uncle and Aunt are very kind, but I cannot consent to burden  them any longer than I can help.\"    A sigh that was almost a moan broke from Esterbrook Elliott's lips.    \"You must not go away, Magdalen. You must stay here--with me!\"    \"You forget yourself,\" she said proudly. \"How dare you speak to me so?  Have you forgotten Miss Lesley? Or are you a traitor to us both?\"    Esterbrook made no answer. He bowed his pale, miserable face before  her, self-condemned.    The breast of the bay sparkled with its countless gems like the breast  of a fair woman. The shores were purple and amethystine in the  distance. Far out, bluish, phantom-like sails clustered against the  pallid horizon. The dory danced like a feather over the ripples. They  were close under the shadow of Chapel Point.           *       *       *       *       *    Marian Lesley waited in vain for her lover that afternoon. When he  came at last in the odorous dusk of the June night she met him on the  acacia-shadowed verandah with cold sweetness. Perhaps some subtle  woman-instinct whispered to her where and how he had spent the  afternoon, for she offered him no kiss, nor did she ask him why he had  failed to come sooner.    His eyes lingered on her in the dim light, taking in every detail of  her sweet womanly refinement and loveliness, and with difficulty he  choked back a groan. Again he asked himself what madness had come over  him, and again for an answer rose up the vision of Magdalen Crawford's  face as he had seen it that day, crimsoning beneath his gaze.    It was late when he left. Marian watched him out of sight, standing  under the acacias. She shivered as with a sudden chill. \"I feel as I  think Vashti must have felt,\" she murmured aloud, \"when, discrowned  and unqueened, she crept out of the gates of Shushan to hide her  broken heart. I wonder if Esther has already usurped my sceptre. Has  that girl at the Cove, with her pale, priestess-like face and  mysterious eyes, stolen his heart from me? Perhaps not, for it may  never have been mine. I know that Esterbrook Elliott will be true to  the letter of his vows to me, no matter what it may cost him. But I  want no pallid shadow of the love that belongs to another. The hour of  abdication is at hand, I fear. And what will be left for throneless  Vashti then?\"    Esterbrook Elliott, walking home through the mocking calm of the  night, fought a hard battle with himself.    He was face to face with the truth at last--the bitter knowledge that  he had never loved Marian Lesley, save with a fond, brotherly  affection, and that he did love Magdalen Crawford with a passion that  threatened to sweep before it every vestige of his honour and  loyalty.    He had seen her but three times--and his throbbing heart lay in the  hollow of her cold white hand.    He shut his eyes and groaned. What madness. What unutterable folly! He  was not free--he was bound to another by every cord of honour and  self-respect. And, even were he free, Magdalen Crawford would be no  fit wife for him--in the eyes of the world, at least. A girl from the  Cove--a girl with little education and no social standing--aye! but he  loved her.    He groaned again and again in his misery. Afar down the slope the bay  waters lay like an inky strip and the distant, murmurous plaint of the  sea came out of the stillness of the night; the lights at the Cove  glimmered faintly.    In the week that followed he went to the Cove every day. Sometimes he  did not see Magdalen; at other times he did. But at the end of the  week he had conquered in the bitter, heart-crushing struggle with  himself. If he had weakly given way to the first mad sweep of a new  passion, the strength of his manhood reasserted itself at last.  Faltering and wavering were over, though there was passionate pain in  his voice when he said at last, \"I am not coming back again,  Magdalen.\"    They were standing in the shadow of the pine-fringed point that ran  out to the left of the Cove. They had been walking together along the  shore, watching the splendour of the sea sunset that flamed and glowed  in the west, where there was a sea of mackerel clouds, crimson and  amber tinted, with long, ribbon-like strips of apple-green sky  between. They had walked in silence, hand in hand, as children might  have done, yet with the stir and throb of a mighty passion seething in  their hearts.    Magdalen turned as Esterbrook spoke, and looked at him in a long  silence. The bay stretched out before them, tranced and shimmering; a  few stars shone down through the gloom of dusk. Right across the  translucent greens and roses and blues of the west hung a dark,  unsightly cloud, like the blurred outline of a monstrous bat. In the  dim, reflected light the girl's mournful face took on a weird,  unearthly beauty. She turned her eyes from Esterbrook Elliott's set  white face to the radiant gloom of the sea.    \"That is best,\" she answered at last, slowly.    \"Best--yes! Better that we had never met! I love you--you know  it--words are idle between us. I never loved before--I thought I did.  I made a mistake and I must pay the penalty of that mistake. You  understand me?\"    \"I understand,\" she answered simply.    \"I do not excuse myself--I have been weak and cowardly and disloyal.  But I have conquered myself--I will be true to the woman to whom I am  pledged. You and I must not meet again. I will crush this madness to  death. I think I have been delirious ever since that day I saw you  first, Magdalen. My brain is clearer now. I see my duty and I mean to  do it at any cost. I dare not trust myself to say more. Magdalen, I  have much for which to ask your forgiveness.\"    \"There is nothing to forgive,\" she said steadily. \"I have been as much  to blame as you. If I had been as resolute as I ought to have been--if  I had sent you away the second time as I did the first--this would not  have come to pass. I have been weak too, and I deserve to atone for my  weakness by suffering. There is only one path open to us. Esterbrook,  good-bye.\" Her voice quivered with an uncontrollable"]]]
