His first taste of food was a great experience,  and gave him some entirely new ideas of life. One day he was lying with  his head up-stream, as was his usual habit, when a particularly fat,  plump little larva, torn from his home by the remorseless river, came  drifting down with the current. He looked very tempting, and our friend  sallied out from under a stick and caught him on the fly, just as he had  seen the star-gazer catch his own brother. The funny little creature  wriggled deliciously on his tongue, and he held him between his jaws for  a moment in a kind of ecstasy; but he couldn't quite make up his mind to  swallow him, and presently he spat him out again and went back to the  shadow of his stick to rest and think about it. It was the first time in  his life that he had ever done such a thing, and he felt rather  overwhelmed, but an hour or two later he tried it again, and this time  the living morsel did not stop in his mouth, but went straight on down.    It was really something more than a new experience--this first mouthful  of food--for it marked a turning-point in his career. Up to this time he  had lived entirely on the provisions which his parents had left him, but  henceforth he was independent and could take care of himself. He was no  longer an embryo; he was a real fish, a genuine _Salvelinus fontinalis_,  as carnivorous as the biggest and fiercest of all his relations. The  cleft in his breast might close up now, and the last remnant of his  yolk-sac vanish forever. He was done with it. He had graduated from the  nursery, and had found his place on the battle-field of life.    It must be admitted, however, that he did not look much like a mature  trout, even now. He was less than three-quarters of an inch long, and  his big head, bulging eyes, and capacious mouth were out of all  proportion to his small and feeble body. But time and food were all  that was needed to set these matters right; and now that he had learned  how, he set to work and did his level best. I should be afraid to guess  how many tiny water-creatures, insects and larvae and crustaceae, found  their way down his throat, but it is pretty safe to say that he often  ate more than his own weight in a single day. And so he grew in size and  strength and symmetry, and from being a quiet, languid baby, always  hiding in dark corners, and attending strictly to his own affairs, he  became one of the liveliest and most inquisitive little fishes in all  the stream. To a certain extent he developed a fondness for travelling,  and in company with other troutlets of his own age and size he often  journeyed from place to place in search of new surroundings and new  things to eat. In fly-time he found a bountiful food-supply in the  mosquitoes and black-flies that swarmed over the stream, and it was fun  to see him leap from the water, catch one of them in his mouth, and drop  back with a triumphant little splash. It wasn't really very considerate  in him to prey on those biting, stinging flies, for in after years they  would be his best defenders against anglers and fishermen, but  consideration doesn't seem to be one of the strong points in a brook  trout's character.    It would take too long to tell of all his youthful doings during the  next year, and of all his narrow escapes, and the many tight places that  he got into and out of. It was a wonder that he ever pulled through at  all, but I suppose it is necessary that a few trout should grow up, for,  if they didn't, who would there be to eat the little ones?    Once a kingfisher dived for him, missed him by a hair's-breadth, and  flew back, scolding and chattering, to his perch on an old stub that  leaned far out over the water. And once he had a horrible vision of an  immense loon close behind him, with long neck stretched out, and huge  bill just ready to make the fatal grab. He dodged and got away, but it  frightened him about as badly as anything can frighten a creature with  no more nerves than a fish. And many other such adventures he had--too  many to enumerate. However, I don't think they ever troubled him very  much except for the moment. He grew more wary, no doubt, but he didn't  do much worrying. Somehow or other he always escaped by the skin of his  teeth, and the next spring he was swallowing the new crop of young fry  with as little concern as his older relations had shown in trying to  swallow him. So far he seemed to be one of the few who are foreordained  to eat and not be eaten, though it was more than likely that in the end  he, too, would die a violent death.    When he was about a year and a half old he noticed that all the larger  trout in the stream were gathering in places where the water was  shallow, the bottom pebbly, and the current rapid; and that they acted  as if they thought they had very important business on hand. He wanted  to do as the others did, and so it happened that he went back again to  the gravelly shallow where the air-bubbles had first found him. By this  time he was about as large as your finger, or possibly a trifle larger,  and he had all the bumptiousness of youth and was somewhat given to  pushing himself in where he wasn't wanted.    The male trout were the first to arrive, and they promptly set to work  to prepare nests for their mates, who were expected a little later. It  was a simple process. All they did was to shove the gravel aside with  their noses and fins and tails, and then fan the sediment away until  they had made nice, clean little hollows in the bed of the stream; but  there was a good deal of excitement and jealousy over it, and every  little while they had to stop and have a scrap. The biggest and  strongest always wanted the best places, and if they happened to take a  fancy for a location occupied by a smaller and weaker fish, they drove  him out without ceremony and took possession by right of the conqueror.  For the most part their fighting seemed rather tame, for they did little  more than butt each other in the ribs with their noses, but once in a  while they really got their dander up and bit quite savagely. And when  the lady trout came to inspect the nests that had been prepared for  them, then times were livelier than ever, and the jealousy and rivalry  ran very high, indeed.    Of course our Trout was too young to bear a very prominent part in these  proceedings, but he and some companions of about his own age skirmished  around the edges of the nesting grounds, and seemed to take a wicked  delight in teasing the old males and running away just in time to escape  punishment. And when the nests began to be put to practical use, the  yearlings were very much in evidence. Strictly fresh eggs are as good  eating down under the water as they are on land, and, partly on this  account, and partly because direct sunshine is considered very injurious  to them, the mothers always covered them with gravel as quickly as  possible. But in spite of the best of care the current was constantly  catching some of them and sweeping them away, and our young friend would  creep up as near as he dared, and whenever one of the yellow-brown balls  came his way he would gobble it down with as little remorse as he had  felt for his first larva. Now and then an irate father would turn upon  him fiercely and chase him off, but in a few minutes he would be back  again, watching for eggs as eagerly as ever. Once, indeed, he had a  rather close call, for the biggest old male in all the stream came after  him with mouth open as if he would swallow him whole, as he could very  easily have done. Our friend was almost caught when the big fellow  happened to glance back and saw another trout coming to visit his wife,  and promptly abandoned the chase and went home to see about it.    A year later our Trout went again to the gravelly shallow, and this  time, being six inches long and about thirty months old, he decided to  make a nest of his own. He did so, and had just induced a most beautiful  young fish of the other sex to come and examine it, with a view to  matrimony, when that same big bully appeared on the scene, promptly  turned him out of house and home, and began courting the beautiful young  creature himself. It was very exasperating, not to say humiliating, but  it was the sort of thing that one must expect when one is only a  two-year-old.    The next year he had better luck. As another summer passed away, and the  cooler weather came on, he arrayed himself in his wedding finery, and it  almost seemed as if he had stolen some of the colors of the swamp  maples, in their gay fall dress, and was using them to deck himself out  and make a brave display. In later years he was larger and heavier, but  I don't think he was ever much handsomer than he was in that fourth  autumn of his life. His back was a dark, dusky, olive-green, with  mottlings that were still darker and duskier. His sides were lighter--in  some places almost golden yellow; and scattered irregularly over them  were the small, bright carmine spots that gave him one of his _aliases_,  the \"Speckled Trout.\" Beneath he was usually of a pale cream color, but  now that he had put on his best clothes his vest was bright orange, and  some of his fins were variegated with red and white, while others were a  fiery yellow. He was covered all over with a suit of armor made of  thousands and thousands of tiny scales, so small and fine that the eye  could hardly separate them, and from the bony shoulder-girdle just  behind his gills a raised line, dark and slightly waving, ran back to  his tail, like the sheer-line of a ship. There were other fishes that  were more slender and more finely modelled than he, and possibly more  graceful, but in him there was something besides beauty--something that  told of power and speed and doggedness.

They can only be approached from the leeward, as their smell is  extremely acute. But when accidentally and suddenly fallen in with, they  will passionately assail the intruder. In such fits of passion the  animal thrusts out its tongue repeatedly, lashes its sides with its  tail, and the reddened and sparkling eyes project from their sockets,  and roll furiously. Such is their innate wildness, that none of them  have been completely tamed. When taken young they become, it is true,  accustomed to their keepers, but the approach of other persons renders  them furious; and even their keepers must be careful always to wear the  same sort of dress when going near them. Their great antipathy to the  Bos Taurus, which they either avoid or kill, would render their  domestication, if it were practicable, but little desirable. The  experiments made with a view of obtaining a mixed breed from the Zubr  and Bos Taurus have all failed, and are now strictly prohibited.\"    The rutting season is in August, and continues for about a fortnight;  the calves are produced in May; thus, the period of gestation is between  nine and ten months. The calves continue to suckle nearly twelve months,  and the cows seldom calve oftener than once in three years.    The European Bison differs internally from the common ox in having  fourteen pairs of ribs, whereas the common ox has but thirteen. The  external differences between the two animals are too obvious to require  pointing out.    In 1845, the Emperor of Russia presented to the British Museum a very  fine stuffed specimen of this animal, from which the figure at the head  of this chapter was taken.    The following are its dimensions:--                                                               Ft.  In.

Dimitri de Dolmatoff, Master of the Imperial Forests in the  Government of Grodno, in his note of the capture of the Aurochs,  (written in 1847,) alludes to the statement (made by every writer who  has treated of these animals), that the calves, although taken young,  invariably refuse to be suckled by the Domestic Cow. This he contradicts  in the most explicit manner, on the testimony of his own experience,  having had several instances come under his observation, in which the  young calves of the Aurochs were suckled and reared by cows of the  common domestic species.    Caesar, in his account of the \"Sylva Hercynia\"--the Black Forest--thus  mentions the Urus, amongst other animals, there found:    \"A third kind [of animals] are those called Uri. They are but little  less than Elephants in size, and are of the species, colour, and form of  a bull. Their strength is very great, and also their speed. They spare  neither man nor beast that they see. They cannot be brought to endure  the sight of men, nor be tamed, even when taken young. The people who  take them in pit-falls, assiduously destroy them; and young men harden  themselves in this labour, and exercise themselves in this kind of  chase; and those who have killed a great number--the horns being  publicly exhibited in evidence of the fact--obtain great honour. The  horns, in amplitude, shape, and species, differ much from the horns of  our oxen. They are much sought after; and after having been edged with  silver at their mouths, they are used for drinking vessels at great  feasts.\" (_De Bello Gallico_, lib. vi.)          THE YAK, OR SOORA-GOY.    _Bos Grunniens._      [Illustration]    The following interesting and circumstantial account of this curious  species of Ox, is from the pen of Lieut. Samuel Turner. (_Asiatic  Researches_, vol. iv.)    \"The Yak of Tartary, called Soora-Goy in Hindostan, and which I term the  Bushy-tailed Bull of Tibet, is about the height of an English Bull,  which he resembles in the figure of the body, head, and legs. I could  distinguish between them no essential difference, except only that the  Yak is covered all over with a thick coat of long hair. The head is  rather short, crowned with two smooth round horns, that, tapering from  the setting on, terminate in sharp points, arch inwardly, and near the  extremities are a little turned back. The ears are small; the forehead  appears prominent, being adorned with much curling hair; the eyes are  full and large; the nose smooth and convex; the nostrils small. The  neck is short, describing a curvature nearly equal both above and below;  the withers high and arched; the rump low. Over the shoulders rises a  bunch, which at first sight would seem to be the same kind of exuberance  peculiar to the cattle of Hindostan; but in reality it consists in the  superior length of the hair only, which, as well as that along the ridge  of the back to the setting on of the tail, grows long and erect, but not  harsh. The tail is composed of a prodigious quantity of long flowing  glossy hair, descending to the hock; and is so extremely well furnished,  that not a joint of it is perceptible; but it has much the appearance of  a large bunch of hair artificially set on. The shoulders, rump, and  upper part of the body are clothed with a sort of thick soft wool, but  the inferior parts with straight pendent hair that descends below the  knee; and I have seen it so long in some cattle, which were in high  health and condition, as to trail along the ground. From the chest,  between the fore-legs, issues a large pointed tuft of hair, growing  somewhat larger than the rest. The legs are very short. In every other  respect, hoofs, &c., he resembles the ordinary Bull. There is a great  variety of colours among them, but black and white are the most  prevalent. It is not uncommon to see the long hair upon the ridge of the  back, the tail, the tuft upon the chest, and the legs below the knee  white, when all the rest of the animal is jet black.    \"These cattle, though not large boned, from the profuse quantity of hair  with which they are provided, appear of great bulk. They have a down  heavy look, but are fierce, and discover much impatience at the near  approach of strangers. They do not low loud (like the cattle of  England) any more than those of Hindostan; but make a low grunting  noise, scarcely audible, and that but seldom, when under some impression  of uneasiness. These cattle are pastured in the coldest part of Tibet,  upon short herbage, peculiar to the tops of mountains and bleak plains.  That chain of lofty mountains situated between lat. 27 deg. and 28 deg., which  divides Tibet from Bootan, and whose summits are most commonly covered  with snow, is their favourite haunt. In this vicinity the Southern glens  afford them food and shelter during the severity of the winter; in  milder seasons the Northern aspect is more congenial to their nature,  and admits a wider range. They are a very valuable property to the  tribes of illiterate Tartars, who live in tents, and tend them from  place to place, affording their herdsmen a mode of conveyance, a good  covering, and subsistence. They are never employed in agriculture, but  are extremely useful as beasts of burden; for they are strong,  sure-footed, and carry a great weight. Tents and ropes are manufactured  of their hair, and I have seen, though amongst the humblest ranks of  herdsmen, caps and jackets worn of their skins. Their tails are esteemed  throughout the East, as far as luxury or parade have any influence on  the manners of the people; and on the continent of India are found,  under the denomination of Chowries, in the hands of the meanest grooms,  as well as, occasionally, in those of the first ministers of state. Yet  the best requital with which the care of their keepers is at length  rewarded for selecting them good pastures, is in the abundant quantity  of rich milk they give, yielding most excellent butter, which they have  a custom of depositing in skins or bladders, and excluding the air; it  keeps in this cold climate all the year, so that after some time  tending their flocks, when a sufficient stock is accumulated, it remains  only to load their cattle, and drive them to a proper market with their  own produce, which constitutes, to the utmost verge of Tartary, a most  material article of commerce.\"    The soft fur upon the hump and shoulders is manufactured by the natives  of Tibet into a fine but strong cloth; and, if submitted to the test of  European skill, might no doubt be made to produce a very superior  fabric.    The herdsmen commonly convert the hides into a loose outer garment that  covers the whole of their bodies, hanging down to the knees; and it  proves a sufficient protection against the lowest temperature of the  cold and desolate region which they inhabit. It furnishes at once a  cloak by day and a bed by night.    The Yak is not generally fierce, but, if intruded upon by strangers, it  sometimes manifests very formidable symptoms of impatience, stamping its  feet, whisking its tail aloft, and tossing its head. When excited, it is  not easily appeased, and is exceedingly tenacious of injury, always  showing great fierceness whenever any one approaches who has chanced to  provoke it.    The cow is called _Dhe_, of which the wandering Tartars possess great  numbers, having no means of subsistence but those supplied by their  flocks and herds.    A fine male specimen of this Ox was brought to England by Warren  Hastings, and several attempts were made to procure a cross between it  and the common English Cow, but without success. He invariably refused  to associate with ordinary cattle, and exhibited a decided antipathy to  them. His portrait was painted, and is"]]]
