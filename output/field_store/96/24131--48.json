History has kept a  record of this memorable trial; and has, no reproach to make to men  which does not apply equally to the imperfection of human laws. The  appearance of things, that fatal contradiction which the genius of evil  so often here on earth gives to truth, overwhelmed the poor fisherman  with the most evident proofs.    Trespolo, in whom fear had destroyed all scruples, being first examined,  as having been the young prince's confidant, declared with cool  impudence that, his master having shown a wish to escape for a few days  from the importunities of a young married lady whose passion was  beginning to tire him, had followed him to the island with three or four  of his most faithful servants, and that he himself had adopted the  disguise of a pilgrim, not wishing to betray his excellency's incognito  to the fisher-people, who would certainly have tormented so powerful a  person by all sorts of petitions. Two local watch men, who had happened  to be on the hillside at the moment of the crime, gave evidence that  confirmed the valet's lengthy statement; hidden by some under wood, they  had seen Gabriel rush upon the prince, and had distinctly heard the last  words of the dying man; calling \"Murder!\" All the witnesses, even those  summoned at the request of the prisoner, made his case worse by their  statements, which they tried to make favourable. Thus the court, with  its usual perspicacity and its infallible certainty, succeeded in  establishing the fact that Prince Eligi of Brancaleone, having taken a  temporary dislike to town life, had retired to the little island of  Nisida, there to give himself up peaceably to the pleasure of fishing,  for which he had at all times had a particular predilection (a proof  appeared among the documents of the case that the prince had regularly  been present every other year at the tunny-fishing on his property at  Palermo); that when once he was thus hidden in the island, Gabriel might  have recognised him, having gone with his sister to the procession, a  few days before, and had, no doubt, planned to murder him. On the day  before the night of the crime, the absence of Gabriel and the  discomposure of his father and sister had been remarked. Towards evening  the prince had dismissed his servant, and gone out alone, as his custom  was, to walk by the seashore. Surprised by the storm and not knowing the  byways of the island, he had wandered round the fisherman's house,  seeking a shelter; then Gabriel, encouraged by the darkness and by the  noise of the tempest, which seemed likely to cover the cries of his  victim, had, after prolonged hesitation, resolved to commit his crime,  and having fired two shots at the unfortunate young man without  succeeding in wounding him, had put an end to him by blows of the axe;  lastly, at the moment when, with Solomon's assistance, he was about to  throw the body into the sea, the prince's servants having appeared, they  had gone up to the girl's room, and, inventing their absurd tale, had  cast themselves on their knees before the Virgin, in order to mislead  the authorities. All the circumstances that poor Solomon cited in his  son's favour turned against him: the ladder at Nisida's window belonged  to the fisherman; the dagger which young Brancaleone always carried upon  him to defend himself had evidently been taken from him after his death,  and Gabriel had hastened to break it, so as to destroy, to the best of  his power, the traces of his crime. Bastiano's evidence did not receive  a minute's consideration: he, to destroy the idea of premeditation,  declared that the young fisherman had left him only at the moment when  the storm broke over the island; but, in the first place, the young  diver was known to be Gabriel's most devoted friend and his sister's  warmest admirer, and, in the second, he had been seen to land at Torre  during the same hour in which he had affirmed that he was near to  Nisida. As for the prince's passion for the poor peasant girl, the  magistrates simply shrugged their shoulders at the ridiculous assertion  of that, and especially at the young girl's alleged resistance and the  extreme measures to which the prince was supposed to have resorted to  conquer the virtue of Nisida. Eligi of Brancaleone was so young, so  handsome, so seductive, and at the same time so cool amid his successes,  that he had never been suspected of violence, except in getting rid of  his mistresses. Finally, an overwhelming and unanswerable proof  overthrew all the arguments for the defence: under the fisherman's bed  had been found a purse with the Brancaleone arms, full of gold, the  purse which, if our readers remember, the prince had flung as a last  insult at Gabriel's feet.    The old man did not lose heart at this fabric of lies; after the  pleadings of the advocates whose ruinous eloquence he had bought with  heavy gold, he defended his son himself, and put so much truth, so much  passion, and so many tears into his speech, that the whole audience was  moved, and three of the judges voted for an acquittal; but the majority  was against it, and the fatal verdict was pronounced.    The news at once spread throughout the little island, and caused the  deepest dejection there. The fishers who, at the first irruption of  force, had risen as one man to defend their comrade's cause, bowed their  heads without a murmur before the unquestioned authority of a legal  judgment. Solomon received unflinchingly the stab that pierced his  heart. No sigh escaped his breast; no tear came to his eyes; his wound  did not bleed. Since his son's arrest he had sold all he possessed in  the world, even the little silver cross left by his wife at her death,  even the pearl necklace that flattered his fatherly pride by losing its  whiteness against his dear Nisida's throat; the pieces of gold gained by  the sale of these things he had sewn into his coarse woollen cap, and  had established himself in the city. He ate nothing but the bread thrown  to him by the pity of passers-by, and slept on the steps of churches or  at the magistrates' door.    To estimate at its full value the heroic courage of this unhappy father,  one must take a general view of the whole extent of his misfortune.  Overwhelmed by age and grief, he looked forward with solemn calmness to  the terrible moment which would bear his son, a few days before him, to  the grave. His sharpest agony was the thought of the shame that would  envelop his family. The first scaffold erected in that gently mannered  island would arise for Gabriel, and that ignominious punishment tarnish  the whole population and imprint upon it the first brand of disgrace. By  a sad transition, which yet comes so easily in the destiny of man, the  poor father grew to long for those moments of danger at which he had  formerly trembled, those moments in which his son might have died nobly.  And now all was lost: a long life of work, of abnegation, and of good  deeds, a pure and stainless reputation that had extended beyond the gulf  into distant countries, and the traditional admiration, rising almost to  worship, of several generations; all these things only served to deepen  the pit into which the fisherman had fallen, at one blow, from his  kingly height. Good fame, that divine halo without which nothing here on  earth is sacred, had disappeared. Men no longer dared to defend the poor  wretch, they pitied him. His name would soon carry horror with it, and  Nisida, poor orphan, would be nothing to anyone but the sister of a man  who had been condemned to death. Even Bastiano turned away his face and  wept. Thus, when every respite was over, when poor Solomon's every  attempt had failed, people in the town who saw him smile strangely, as  though under the obsession of some fixed idea, said to one another that  the old man had lost his reason.    Gabriel saw his last day dawn, serenely and calmly. His sleep had been  deep; he awoke full of unknown joy; a cheerful ray of sunlight, falling  through the loophole, wavered over the fine golden straw in his cell; an  autumn breeze playing around him, brought an agreeable coolness to his  brow, and stirred in his long hair. The gaoler, who while he had had him  in his charge had always behaved humanely, struck by his happy looks,  hesitated to announce the priest's visit, in fear of calling the poor  prisoner from his dream. Gabriel received the news with pleasure; he  conversed for two hours with the good priest, and shed sweet tears on  receiving the last absolution. The priest left the prison with tears in  his eyes, declaring aloud that he had never in his life met with a more  beautiful, pure, resigned, and courageous spirit.    The fisherman was still under the influence of this consoling emotion  when his sister entered. Since the day when she had been carried,  fainting, from the room where her brother had just been arrested, the  poor girl, sheltered under the roof of an aunt, and accusing herself of  all the evil that had befallen, had done nothing but weep at the feet of  her holy protectress. Bowed by grief like a young lily before the storm,  she would spend whole hours, pale, motionless, detached from earthly  things, her tears flowing silently upon her beautiful clasped hands.  When the moment came to go and embrace her brother for the last time,  Nisida arose with the courage of a saint. She wiped away the traces of  her tears, smoothed her beautiful black hair, and put on her best white  dress. Poor child, she tried to hide her grief by an angelic deception.  She had the strength to smile! At the sight of her alarming pallor  Gabriel felt his heart wrung, a cloud passed over his eyes; he would  have run to meet her, but, held back by the chain which fettered him to  a pillar of his prison, stepped back sharply and stumbled.

Madame de  Lamotte landed with her son and the stranger, and her husband descended  from the terrace to meet her. Long before he arrived at the garden gate,  his son's arms were around his neck.    \"Are you quite well, Edouard ?\"    \"Oh yes, perfectly.\"    \"And your mother?\"    \"Quite well too. She is behind, in as great a hurry to meet you as I am.  But she can't run as I do, and you must go half-way.\"    \"Whom have you brought with you?\"    \"A gentleman from Paris.\"    \"From Paris?\"    \"Yes, a Monsieur Derues. But mamma will tell you all about that. Here  she is.\"    The cure and the monk arrived just as Monsieur de Lamotte folded his  wife in his arms. Although she had passed her fortieth year, she was  still beautiful enough to justify her husband's eulogism. A moderate  plumpness had preserved the freshness and softness of her skin; her  smile was charming, and her large blue eyes expressed both gentleness  and goodness. Seen beside this smiling and serene countenance, the  appearance of the stranger was downright repulsive, and Monsieur de  Lamotte could hardly repress a start of disagreeable surprise at the  pitiful and sordid aspect of this diminutive person, who stood apart,  looking overwhelmed by conscious inferiority. He was still more  astonished when he saw his son take him by the hand with friendly  kindness, and heard him say--    \"Will you come with me, my friend? We will follow my father and mother.\"    Madame de Lamotte, having greeted the cure, looked at the monk, who was  a stranger to her. A word or two explained matters, and she took her  husband's arm, declining to answer any questions until she reached the  louse, and laughing at his curiosity.    Pierre-Etienne de Saint-Faust de Lamotte, one of the king's equerries,  seigneur of Grange-Flandre, Valperfond, etc., had married  Marie-Francoise Perier in 1760. Their fortune resembled many others of  that period: it was more nominal than actual, more showy than solid. Not  that the husband and wife had any cause for self-reproach, or that their  estates had suffered from dissipation; unstained by the corrupt manners  of the period, their union had been a model of sincere affection, of  domestic virtue and mutual confidence. Marie-Francoise was quite  beautiful enough to have made a sensation in society, but she renounced  it of her own accord, in order to devote herself to the duties of a wife  and mother. The only serious grief she and her husband had experienced  was the loss of two young children. Edouard, though delicate from his  birth, had nevertheless passed the trying years of infancy and early  adolescence; he was them nearly fourteen. With a sweet and rather  effeminate expression, blue eyes and a pleasant smile, he was a striking  likeness of his mother. His father's affection exaggerated the dangers  which threatened the boy, and in his eyes the slightest indisposition  became a serious malady; his mother shared these fears, and in  consequence of this anxiety Edouard's education had been much neglected.  He had been brought up at Buisson-Souef, and allowed to run wild from  morning till night, like a young fawn, exercising the vigour and  activity of its limbs. He had still the simplicity and general ignorance  of a child of nine or ten.    The necessity of appearing at court and suitably defraying the expenses  of his office had made great inroads on Monsieur de Lamotte's fortune.  He had of late lived at Buisson-Souef in the most complete retirement;  but notwithstanding this too long deferred attention to his affairs, his  property was ruining him, for the place required a large expenditure,  and absorbed a large amount of his income without making any tangible  return. He had always hesitated to dispose of the estate on account of  its associations; it was there he had met, courted, and married his  beloved wife; there that the happy days of their youth had been spent;  there that they both wished to grow old together.    Such was the family to which accident had now introduced Derues. The  unfavourable impression made on Monsieur de Lamotte had not passed  unperceived by him; but, being quite accustomed to the instinctive  repugnance which his first appearance generally inspired, Derues had  made a successful study of how to combat and efface this antagonistic  feeling, and replace it by confidence, using different means according  to the persons he had to deal with. He understood at once that vulgar  methods would be useless with Monsieur de Lamotte, whose appearance and  manners indicated both the man of the world and the man of intelligence,  and also he had to consider the two priests, who were both observing him  attentively. Fearing a false step, he assumed the most simple and  insignificant deportment he could, knowing that sooner or later a third  person would rehabilitate him in the opinion of those present. Nor did  he wait long.    Arrived at the drawing-room, Monsieur de Lamotte requested the company  to be seated. Derues acknowledged the courtesy by a bow, and there was a  moment of silence, while Edouard and his mother looked at each other and  smiled. The silence was broken by Madame de Lamotte.    \"Dear Pierre,\" she said, \"you are surprised to see us accompanied by a  stranger, but when you hear what he has done for us you will thank me  for having induced him to return here with us.\"    \"Allow me,\" interrupted Derues, \"allow me to tell you what happened. The  gratitude which madame imagines she owes me causes her to exaggerate a  small service which anybody would have been delighted to render.\"    \"No, monsieur; let me tell it.\"    \"Let mamma tell the story,\" said Edouard.    \"What is it, then? What happened?\" said Monsieur de Lamotte.    \"I am quite ashamed,\" answered Derues; \"but I obey your wishes, madame.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Madame de Lamotte, \"keep your seat, I wish it. Imagine,  Pierre, just six days ago, an accident happened to Edouard and me which  might have had serious consequences.\"    \"And you never wrote to me, Marie?\"    \"I should only have made you anxious, and to no purpose. I had some  business in one of the most crowded parts of Paris; I took a chair, and  Edouard walked beside me. In the rue Beaubourg we were suddenly  surrounded by a mob of low people, who were quarrelling. Carriages  stopped the way, and the horses of one of these took fright in the  confusion and uproar, and bolted, in spite of the coachman's endeavours  to keep them in hand. It was a horrible tumult, and I tried to get out  of the chair, but at that moment the chairmen were both knocked down,  and I fell. It is a miracle I was not crushed. I was dragged insensible  from under the horses' feet and carried into the house before which all  this took place. There, sheltered in a shop and safe from the crowd  which encumbered the doorway, I recovered my senses, thanks to the  assistance of Monsieur Derues, who lives there. But that is not all:  when I recovered I could not walk, I had been so shaken by the fright,  the fall, and the danger I had incurred, and I had to accept his offer  of finding me another chair when the crowd should disperse, and  meanwhile to take shelter in his rooms with his wife, who showed me the  kindest attention.\"    \"Monsieur--\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, rising. But his wife stopped him.    \"Wait a moment; I have not finished yet. Monsieur Derues came back in an  hour, and I was then feeling better; but before, I left I was stupid  enough to say that I had been robbed in the confusion; my diamond  earrings, which had belonged to my mother, were gone. You cannot imagine  the trouble Monsieur Derues took to discover the thief, and all the  appeals he made to the police--I was really ashamed!\"    Although Monsieur de Lamotte did not yet understand what motive, other  than gratitude, had induced his wife to bring this stranger home with  her, he again rose from his seat, and going to Derues, held out his  hand.    \"I understand now the attachment my son shows for you. You are wrong in  trying to lessen your good deed in order to escape from our gratitude,  Monsieur Derues.\"    \"Monsieur Derues?\" inquired the monk.    \"Do you know the name, my father?\" asked Madame de Lamotte eagerly.    \"Edouard had already told me,\" said the monk, approaching Derues.    \"You live in the, rue Beaubourg, and you are Monsieur Derues, formerly a  retail grocer?\"    \"The same, my brother.\"    \"Should you require a reference, I can give it. Chance, madame, has made  you acquainted with a man whose, reputation for piety and honour is well  established; he will permit me to add my praises to yours.\"    \"Indeed, I do not know how I deserve so much honour.\"    \"I am, Brother Marchois, of the Camaldulian order. You see that I know  you well.\"    The monk then proceeded to explain that his community had confided their  affairs to Derues' honesty, he undertaking to dispose of the articles  manufactured by the monks in their retreat. He then recounted a number  of good actions and of marks of piety, which were heard with pleasure  and admiration by those present. Derues received this cloud of incense  with an appearance of sincere modesty and humility, which would have  deceived the most skilful physiognomist.    When the eulogistic warmth of the good brother began to slacken it was  already nearly dark, and the two priests had barely time to regain the  presbytery without incurring the risk of breaking their necks in the  rough road which led to it. They departed at once, and a room was got  ready for Derues.    \"To-morrow,\" said Madame de Lamotte as they separated, \"you can discuss  with my husband the business on which you came: to-morrow, or another  day, for I beg that you will make yourself at home here, and the longer  you will stay the better it will please us.\"    The night was a sleepless one for Derues, whose brain was occupied by a  confusion of criminal"]]]
