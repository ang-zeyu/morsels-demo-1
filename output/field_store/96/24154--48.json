[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#8)"],[1,"Encyclopedia, says: The glory of Justinian's reign is  the famous digest of the Roman law, known generally as the Justinian code,  which was compiled out of the Gregorian, Theodorian and Hermogenian codes,  by ten of the ablest lawyers of the empire, under the guiding genius of  the Jurisconsult Tribonian. Their labors consisted, first, of the \"Statute  Law.\" Second, The \"Pandects,\" a digest of the decisions and opinions of  former magistrates and lawyers. These two compilations consisted of matter  that lay scattered through more than two thousand volumes, now reduced to  fifty. Third, The \"Institutes,\" an abridgement in four books, containing  the substance of all the laws in the elementary form. Fourth, The laws of  _modern date_, including Justinian's own edicts, collected into one volume  and called the \"New Code.\"    The word \"Pandects\" is a term of great importance in the investigation of  the origin of the Roman laws; it points directly and certainly to the fact  that the Roman laws, known as the _Pandects_, were gathered from all laws,  for such is the import of the term itself when it is associated with the  term _laws_. Moreover, it is a Greek term, showing at once that the  Grecian laws contributed largely to the _Pandects_ of the Roman laws. The  term is defined by Liddel and Scott in the words, _all-receiving,  all-containing_, so the _Pandects_ were gathered from _all laws_,  consequently from the laws of Moses as well as from the Grecian laws,  which were largely from the laws of Moses. This relationship, existing in  the science of law, between the laws of the Bible and the Roman laws  gotten up under Justinian, can be set aside by the infidels when stubborn  facts, as well as similitude, are set aside.    Sir Matthew Hale says: Among the many preferences which the laws of  England have above others, the two principal ones are, the hereditary  transmission of property and the trial by jury, which originated with the  Jews, for, by the law of Moses, the succession in the descending line was  to the sons, the oldest having a double portion. If the son died in his  father's lifetime, the grandson heired the portion of his father. Trial by  jury was first suggested in the administration of penal justice among the  Jews. Such trials came off publicly in the gates of the city, and their  judges were elders and Levites, taken from the general mass of the  citizens. \"A part of the common law, as it now stands, was first collected  by Alfred the Great, youngest son of Athelwolf, or Ethelwolf, King of the  West Saxons, who took the crown in 871. It is asserted by Sismondi, in his  history of the fall of the Roman Empire, that when the above named prince  caused a republication of the Saxon laws he inserted several laws taken  from the Judaical ritual into his statutes to give new strength and  cogency to the principles of morality. So it is a common thing in the  early English reports to find frequent references to the Mosaic law.  Sismondi also states that one of the first acts of the clergy under Pepin  and Charlemagne, of France, was to introduce into the legislation of the  Franks several of the Mosaic laws found in the books of Deuteronomy and  Leviticus. It is truthfully said that the entire code of civil and  judicial statutes throughout New England, and throughout the States first  settled by the descendants of New England, were the judicial laws of God  as they were delivered by Moses. From God himself one nation, and one  only, received their laws, and they are worthy of being regarded as models  for all succeeding ages. The learned Michaelis, who was professor of law  in the University of Gottingen, says that a man who considers laws  philosophically, who would survey them with the eye of a Montesquieu,  would never overlook the laws of Moses.\"    Goguet, in his learned treatise upon the origin of laws, says: The more we  meditate on the laws of Moses the more we shall perceive their wisdom and  inspiration. They alone have undergone no changes, amendments or  retrenchments for more than three thousand years, while all others have  been receiving amendments and additions.    Milman, in his history of the Jews, says: The Hebrew law-giver exercised a  more extensive and permanent influence over the destinies of mankind than  any other individual in the annals of the world. The late Fisher Ames, a  distinguished statesman and jurist, said, \"No man can be a sound lawyer  who is not well read in the laws of Moses.\" The seat of this law is the  bosom of God, and her voice is the order, peace and happiness of the  world.            DID ADAM FALL OR RISE?      The old scholastic ideas of \"total hereditary depravity, and miraculous  conversion,\" with their correllates, have driven more minds into doubt and  skepticism than most of men are apprised of. The reasons are evident.  First. Common sense shrinks from them as ideas which are destructive of  every principle of human responsibility. Second. They are opposed to the  testimony of consciousness which asserts the soul's freedom. Third. They  are opposed to correct ideas of justice as it is administered in all  governments, both human and divine.    \"And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us to know  good and evil.\" Our fathers, of Calvinistic type of faith, used to tell us  that this language only asserted Adam's experience of conscious guilt;  that he knew good before he transgressed, and had experimental knowledge  of evil after he transgressed. This was the best they could do and save  their Calvinism, and even this would not have saved it in the days of  investigation like ours. The Lord did not say, \"The man is become as one  of us knowing good and evil,\" but \"the man is become as one of us _to  know_ good and evil.\" The old view of the subject virtually says, The Lord  had experimental knowledge of both good and evil, and that the way in  which Adam became Godlike was the way of the transgressor. Then the  greatest Godlikeness is the result of the greatest sinning. _What  nonsense!_ The Bible says: \"And the eyes of them both were opened, and  they knew they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made  themselves aprons.\" The account also asserts that the \"tree of knowledge  of good and evil\" was \"a tree to be desired to make one wise.\" Total  depravity and its correllates could never have been found in this context.  This history is not responsible for it, nor for the mischiefs it has  produced.    The Heavenly Father knew, when he created man, that he would fail upon  trial. To have prevented this would have been nothing short of an  interference with man's freedom, and consequently his responsibility,  without which he could not have been man. The Lord saw man in his alien  state and in his return to holiness. He \"made of one blood all nations of  men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, and determined the times  before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation, that they _should  seek the Lord_.\"--See Acts 17: 26. It was necessary that man should become  as God _to know good and evil_ in order that he might be continued upon  trial in a world of good and evil. To this end the Divine Ruler placed in  the test fruit, the fruit of the tree that was forbidden, a mental lever  to endow man with wisdom as God to know good and evil, without which the  man's responsibility in relation to good and evil could never have been.    The fruit of the tree of life was for man's physical nature; was to  control the law of organic being, regulating waste and supply so as to  prevent the present effects of old age, and keep man in perpetual  conditions of youth. After man had sinned, with the knowledge of good and  evil, he was master of his position, and now, lest he \"put forth his hand  and take of the tree of life, and eat and live forever,\" subjected to  shame, to torment, to anguish and tribulation, mental suffering, a lost  being in the state of abandoned fallen angels, with a possibility of  corrupting his conscience until it should be past feeling, seared as with  a hot iron, and so glory in his shame; or, otherwise, be beyond the motive  power of life and the restraining power of death, the Infinite One placed  him beyond the reach of the tree of life. All of these ways or doings of  the Heavenly Father were right, were merciful, were best for man. THE WAYS  OF GOD ARE RIGHT. THE WAYS OF GOD ARE BEST. Farewell to \"total hereditary  depravity, and farewell to all its necessary correllations, such as  miraculous conversion,\" etc.    Man is mentally endowed with wisdom by the tree of the knowledge of good  and evil; is kept from ruining himself forever by being placed beyond the  reach of the tree of life; is continued upon trial in a world of good and  evil; is responsible through his knowledge of good and evil, and the  motive power of life, and the restraining power of death is preserved to  control him for his own eternal good; and, blessed be the name of our  Heavenly Father, his eyes are open; so if man goes to perdition he must go  _with his eyes open_. In all this we have perfect harmony with all Bible  duty and truth, and also with science and universal consciousness of  freedom and ability to choose and act. Not by a hair's breadth has God  ever infringed upon the freedom of the soul to shape and mould its own  moral character, and shape its own moral destiny; but he has done many  wonderful things to better the condition of the free soul--not forsaking it  in the hour of greatest need.    The soul's free, voluntary service is that which constitutes the  requirement of religion in all the ages.            DID THEY DREAM IT, OR WAS IT SO?      That there was such a person as Jesus Christ living in the land of Judea  at the time allowed by all Christians is no longer disputed by  unbelievers. That he lived a life far superior to the lives of all other  men is also conceded. If the powers of life and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#8)"],[1,"with  bad, or bad with good, is that the divergence of their characters and  aims is the greatest possible.    Another good rule in friendship is this: do not let an excessive  affection hinder the highest interests of your friends. This very  often happens. I will go again to the region of fable for an instance.  Neoptolemus could never have taken Troy if he had been willing to listen  to Lycomedes, who had brought him up, and with many tears tried to  prevent his going there. Again, it often happens that important business  makes it necessary to part from friends: the man who tries to baulk it,  because he thinks that he cannot endure the separation, is of a weak  and effeminate nature, and on that very account makes but a poor friend.  There are, of course, limits to what you ought to expect from a friend  and to what you should allow him to demand of you. And these you must  take into calculation in every case.    21. Again, there is such a disaster, so to speak, as having to break off  friendship. And sometimes it is one we cannot avoid. For at this point  the stream of our discourse is leaving the intimacies of the wise and  touching on the friendship of ordinary people. It will happen at times  that an outbreak of vicious conduct affects either a man's friends  themselves or strangers, yet the discredit falls on the friends. In  such cases friendships should be allowed to die out gradually by an  intermission of intercourse. They should, as I have been told that Cato  used to say, rather be unstitched than torn in twain; unless, indeed,  the injurious conduct be of so violent and outrageous a nature as  to make an instant breach and separation the only possible course  consistent with honour and rectitude. Again, if a change in character  and aim takes place, as often happens, or if party politics produces an  alienation of feeling (I am now speaking, as I said a short time ago, of  ordinary friendships, not of those of the wise), we shall have to be on  our guard against appearing to embark upon active enmity while we only  mean to resign a friendship. For there can be nothing more discreditable  than to be at open war with a man with whom you have been intimate.  Scipio, as you are aware, had abandoned his friendship for Quintus  Pompeius on my account; and again, from differences of opinion in  politics, he became estranged from my colleague Metellus. In both cases  he acted with dignity and moderation, shewing that he was offended  indeed, but without rancour.    Our first object, then, should be to prevent a breach; our second, to  secure that, if it does occur, our friendship should seem to have died  a natural rather than a violent death. Next, we should take care that  friendship is not converted into active hostility, from which flow  personal quarrels, abusive language, and angry recriminations. These  last, however, provided that they do not pass all reasonable limits  of forbearance, we ought to put up with, and, in compliment to an old  friendship, allow the party that inflicts the injury, not the one that  submits to it, to be in the wrong. Generally speaking, there is but one  way of securing and providing oneself against faults and inconveniences  of this sort--not to be too hasty in bestowing our affection, and not to  bestow it at all on unworthy objects.    Now, by \"worthy of friendship\" I mean those who have in themselves the  qualities which attract affection. This sort of man is rare; and indeed  all excellent things are rare; and nothing in the world is so hard to  find as a thing entirely and completely perfect of its kind. But most  people not only recognize nothing as good in our life unless it is  profitable, but look upon friends as so much stock, caring most for  those by whom they hope to make most profit. Accordingly they never  possess that most beautiful and most spontaneous friendship which must  be sought solely for itself without any ulterior object. They fail  also to learn from their own feelings the nature and the strength of  friendship. For every one loves himself, not for any reward which such  love may bring, but because he is dear to himself independently of  anything else. But unless this feeling is transferred to another, what  a real friend is will never be revealed; for he is, as it were, a  second self. But if we find these two instincts shewing themselves in  animals,--whether of the air or the sea or the land, whether wild or  tame,--first, a love of self, which in fact is born in everything that  lives alike; and, secondly, an eagerness to find and attach themselves  to other creatures of their own kind; and if this natural action is  accompanied by desire and by something resembling human love, how much  more must this be the case in man by the law of his nature? For man not  only loves himself, but seeks another whose spirit he may so blend with  his own as almost to make one being of two.    22. But most people unreasonably, not to speak of modesty, want such  a friend as they are unable to be themselves, and expect from their  friends what they do not themselves give. The fair course is first to be  good yourself, and then to look out for another of like character. It  is between such that the stability in friendship of which we have been  talking can be secured; when, that is to say, men who are united by  affection learn, first of all, to rule those passions which enslave  others, and in the next place to take delight in fair and equitable  conduct, to bear each other's burdens, never to ask each other for  anything inconsistent with virtue and rectitude, and not only to serve  and love but also to respect each other. I say \"respect\"; for if respect  is gone, friendship has lost its brightest jewel. And this shows the  mistake of those who imagine that friendship gives a privilege to  licentiousness and sin. Nature has given us friendship as the handmaid  of virtue, not as a partner in guilt: to the end that virtue, being  powerless when isolated to reach the highest objects, might succeed in  doing so in union and partnership with another. Those who enjoy in the  present, or have enjoyed in the past, or are destined to enjoy in the  future such a partnership as this, must be considered to have secured  the most excellent and auspicious combination for reaching nature's  highest good. This is the partnership, I say, which combines moral  rectitude, fame, peace of mind, serenity: all that men think desirable  because with them life is happy, but without them cannot be so. This  being our best and highest object, we must, if we desire to attain it,  devote ourselves to virtue; for without virtue we can obtain neither  friendship nor anything else desirable. In fact, if virtue be neglected,  those who imagine themselves to possess friends will find out their  error as soon as some grave disaster forces them to make trial of them.  Wherefore, I must again and again repeat, you must satisfy your judgment  before engaging your affections: not love first and judge afterwards. We  suffer from carelessness in many of our undertakings: in none more than  in selecting and cultivating our friends. We put the cart before the  horse, and shut the stable door when the steed is stolen, in defiance  of the old proverb. For, having mutually involved ourselves in a  long-standing intimacy or by actual obligations, all on a sudden some  cause of offence arises and we break off our friendships in full career.    23. It is this that makes such carelessness in a matter of supreme  importance all the more worthy of blame. I say \"supreme importance,\"  because friendship is the one thing about the utility of which everybody  with one accord is agreed. That is not the case in regard even to virtue  itself; for many people speak slightingly of virtue as though it were  mere puffing and self-glorification. Nor is it the case with riches.  Many look down on riches, being content with a little and taking  pleasure in poor fare and dress, And as to the political offices for  which some have a burning desire--how many entertain such a contempt  for them as to think nothing in the world more empty and trivial!    And so on with the rest; things desirable in the eyes of some are  regarded by very many as worthless. But of friendship all think alike to  a man, whether those have devoted themselves to politics, or those who  delight in science and philosophy, or those who follow a private way of  life and care for nothing but their own business, or those lastly who  have given themselves body and soul to sensuality--they all think, I  say, that without friendship life is no life, if they want some part  of it, at any rate, to be noble. For friendship, in one way or another,  penetrates into the lives of us all, and suffers no career to be  entirely free from its influence. Though a man be of so churlish and  unsociable a nature as to loathe and shun the company of mankind, as we  are told was the case with a certain Timon at Athens, yet even he cannot  refrain from seeking some one in whose hearing he may disgorge the  venom of his bitter temper. We should see this most clearly, if it were  possible that some god should carry us away from these haunts of men,  and place us somewhere in perfect solitude, and then should supply us in  abundance with everything necessary to our nature, and yet take from us  entirely the opportunity of looking upon a human being. Who could steel  himself to endure such a life? Who would not lose in his loneliness the  zest for all pleasures? And indeed this is the point of the observation  of, I think, Archytas of Tarentum. I have it third hand; men who were my  seniors told me that their seniors had told them. It was this: \"If a man  could ascend to heaven and get a clear view of the natural order of  the universe, and the beauty of the heavenly bodies, that wonderful  spectacle would give him small pleasure, though nothing could be  conceived"]]]
