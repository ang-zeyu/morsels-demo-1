Very  often quarrels would arise during the progress of dinner; and more  than once I thought the knives, which they nearly swallowed at every  mouthful, would have been turned against one another. It was, I always  thought, extremely fortunate that the reckless men rarely stimulated  their excitable passions with strong drink. Tea and coffee were the  common beverages of the Americans; Englishmen, and men of other  nations, being generally distinguishable by their demand for wine and  spirits. But the Yankee's capacity for swilling tea and coffee was  prodigious. I saw one man drink ten cups of coffee; and finding his  appetite still unsatisfied, I ran across to my brother for advice.  There was a merry twinkle in his eyes as he whispered, \"I always put  in a good spoonful of salt after the sixth cup. It chokes them off  admirably.\"    It was no easy thing to avoid being robbed and cheated by the less  scrupulous travellers; although I think it was only the 'cutest Yankee  who stood any fair chance of outwitting me. I remember an instance of  the biter bit, which I will narrate, hoping it may make my reader  laugh as heartily as its recollection makes me. He was a tall, thin  Yankee, with a furtive glance of the eyes, and an amazing appetite,  which he seemed nothing loath to indulge: his appetite for eggs  especially seemed unbounded. Now, I have more than once said how  expensive eggs were; and this day they happened to be eightpence  apiece. Our plan was to charge every diner according to the number of  shells found upon his plate. Now, I noticed how eagerly my thin guest  attacked my eggs, and marvelled somewhat at the scanty pile of shells  before him. My suspicions once excited, I soon fathomed my Yankee  friend's dodge. As soon as he had devoured the eggs, he conveyed  furtively the shells beneath the table, and distributed them  impartially at the feet of his companions. I gave my little black maid  a piece of chalk, and instructions; and creeping under the table, she  counted the scattered shells, and chalked the number on the tail of  his coat. And when he came up to pay his score, he gave up his number  of eggs in a loud voice; and when I contradicted him, and referred to  the coat-_tale_ in corroboration of _my_ score, there was a general  laugh against him. But there was a nasty expression in his cat-like  eyes, and an unpleasant allusion to mine, which were not agreeable,  and dissuaded me from playing any more practical jokes upon the  Yankees.    I followed my brother's example closely, and forbade all gambling in  my hotel. But I got some idea of its fruits from the cases brought to  me for surgical treatment from the faro and monte tables. Gambling at  Cruces, and on the Isthmus generally, was a business by which money  was wormed out of the gold-seekers and gold-finders. No attempt was  made to render it attractive, as I have seen done elsewhere. The  gambling-house was often plainer than our hotels; and but for the  green tables, with their piles of money and gold-dust, watched over by  a well-armed determined banker, and the eager gamblers around, you  would not know that you were in the vicinity of a spot which the  English at home designate by a very decided and extreme name. A Dr.  Casey--everybody familiar with the Americans knows their fondness for  titles--owned the most favoured table in Cruces; and this, although he  was known to be a reckless and unscrupulous villain. Most of them knew  that he had been hunted out of San Francisco; and at that time--years  before the Vigilance Committee commenced their labours of  purification--a man too bad for that city must have been a prodigy of  crime: and yet, and although he was violent-tempered, and had a knack  of referring the slightest dispute to his revolver, his table was  always crowded; probably because--the greatest rogues have some good  qualities--he was honest in his way, and played fairly.    Occasionally some distinguished passengers passed on the upward and  downward tides of rascality and ruffianism, that swept periodically  through Cruces. Came one day, Lola Montes, in the full zenith of her  evil fame, bound for California, with a strange suite. A good-looking,  bold woman, with fine, bad eyes, and a determined bearing; dressed  ostentatiously in perfect male attire, with shirt-collar turned down  over a velvet lapelled coat, richly worked shirt-front, black hat,  French unmentionables, and natty, polished boots with spurs. She  carried in her hand a handsome riding-whip, which she could use as  well in the streets of Cruces as in the towns of Europe; for an  impertinent American, presuming--perhaps not unnaturally--upon her  reputation, laid hold jestingly of the tails of her long coat, and as  a lesson received a cut across his face that must have marked him for  some days. I did not wait to see the row that followed, and was glad  when the wretched woman rode off on the following morning. A very  different notoriety followed her at some interval of time--Miss  Catherine Hayes, on her successful singing tour, who disappointed us  all by refusing to sing at Cruces; and after her came an English  bishop from Australia, who need have been a member of the church  militant to secure his pretty wife from the host of admirers she had  gained during her day's journey from Panama.    Very quarrelsome were the majority of the crowds, holding life cheap,  as all bad men strangely do--equally prepared to take or lose it upon  the slightest provocation. Few tales of horror in Panama could be  questioned on the ground of improbability. Not less partial were many  of the natives of Cruces to the use of the knife; preferring, by the  way, to administer sly stabs in the back, when no one was by to see  the dastard blow dealt. Terribly bullied by the Americans were the  boatmen and muleteers, who were reviled, shot, and stabbed by these  free and independent filibusters, who would fain whop all creation  abroad as they do their slaves at home. Whenever any Englishmen were  present, and in a position to interfere with success, this bullying  was checked; and they found, instead of the poor Spanish Indians,  foemen worthy of their steel or lead. I must do them credit to say,  that they were never loath to fight any one that desired that passing  excitement, and thought little of ending their journey of life  abruptly at the wretched wayside town of Cruces. It very often  happened so, and over many a hasty head and ready hand have I seen the  sod roughly pressed down, their hot hearts stilled suddenly in some  senseless quarrel. And so in time I grew to have some considerable  experience in the treatment of knife and gun-shot wounds.    One night I heard a great noise outside my window, and on rising found  a poor boatman moaning piteously, and in a strange jumble of many  languages begging me to help him. At first I was afraid to open the  door, on account of the noisy mob which soon joined him, for villainy  was very shrewd at Cruces; but at last I admitted him, and found that  the poor wretch's ears had been cruelly split by some hasty citizen of  the United States. I stitched them up as well as I could, and silenced  his cries. And at any time, if you happened to be near the river when  a crowd were arriving or departing, your ears would be regaled with a  choice chorus of threats, of which ear-splitting, eye-gouging,  cow-hiding, and the application of revolvers were the mildest. Against  the negroes, of whom there were many in the Isthmus, and who almost  invariably filled the municipal offices, and took the lead in every  way, the Yankees had a strong prejudice; but it was wonderful to see  how freedom and equality elevate men, and the same negro who perhaps  in Tennessee would have cowered like a beaten child or dog beneath an  American's uplifted hand, would face him boldly here, and by equal  courage and superior physical strength cow his old oppressor.    When more than ordinary squabbles occurred in the street or at the  gambling-tables, the assistance of the soldier-police of New Granada  was called in, and the affair sometimes assumed the character of a  regular skirmish. The soldiers--I wish I could speak better of  them--were a dirty, cowardly, indolent set, more prone to use their  knives than their legitimate arms, and bore old rusty muskets, and  very often marched unshod. Their officers were in outward appearance a  few shades superior to the men they commanded, but, as respects  military proficiency, were their equals. Add to this description of  their _personnel_ the well-known fact, that you might commit the  grossest injustice, and could obtain the simplest justice only by  lavish bribery, and you may form some idea of our military protectors.    Very practised and skilful in thieving were the native population of  Cruces--I speak of the majority, and except the negroes--always more  inclined to do a dishonest night's labour at great risk, than an  honest day's work for fair wages; for justice was always administered  strictly to the poor natives--it was only the foreigners who could  evade it or purchase exemption. Punishment was severe; and in extreme  cases the convicts were sent to Carthagena, there to suffer  imprisonment of a terrible character. Indeed, from what I heard of the  New Granada prisons, I thought no other country could match them, and  continued to think so until I read how the ingenuity in cruelty of his  Majesty the King of Naples put the torturers of the New Granada  Republic to the blush.    I generally avoided claiming the protection of the law whilst on the  Isthmus, for I found it was--as is the case in civilized England from  other causes--rather an expensive luxury.

Here are a few specimen sentences:--         Fail not most carefully to peruse the books of the Greek, Arabian,       and Latin physicians, not despising the Talmudists and Cabalists;       and by frequent anatomies get thee the perfect knowledge of that       other world, called the microcosm, which is man. And at some of the       hours of the day apply thy mind to the study of the Holy       Scriptures: first, in Greek, the New Testament, with the Epistles       of the Apostles; and then the Old Testament in Hebrew. In brief,       let me see thee an abyss and bottomless pit of knowledge....         ...It behoveth thee to serve, to love, to fear God, and on him to       cast all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and, by faith formed in       charity, to cleave unto him, so that thou mayst never be separated       from him by thy sins. Suspect the abuses of the world. Set not thy       heart upon vanity, for this life is transitory; but the Word of the       Lord endureth forever.    \"Friar John\" is a mighty man of valor, who figures equivocally in the  story of Gargantua and Pantagruel. The Abbey of Theleme is given him in  reward of his services. Some have identified this fighting monk with  Martin Luther. The representation is, on the whole, so conducted as to  leave the reader's sympathies at least half enlisted in favor of the  fellow, rough and roistering as he is.    Panurge is the hero of the romance of Pantagruel,--almost more than  Pantagruel himself. It would be unpardonable to dismiss Rabelais  without first making our readers know Panurge by, at least, a few traits  of his character and conduct. Panurge was a shifty but unscrupulous  adventurer, whom Pantagruel, pious prince as he was, coming upon him by  chance, took and kept under his patronage. Panurge was an arch-imp of  mischief,--mischief indulged in the form of obscene and malicious  practical jokes. Rabelais describes his accomplishments in a long strain  of discourse, from which we purge our selection to follow,--thereby  transforming Panurge into a comparatively proper and virtuous person:--         He had threescore and three tricks to come by it [money] at his       need, of which the most honorable and most ordinary was in manner       of thieving, secret purloining, and filching, for he was a wicked,       lewd rogue, a cozener, drinker, roysterer, rover, and a very       dissolute and debauched fellow, if there were any in Paris;       otherwise, and in all matters else, the best and most virtuous man       in the world; and he was still contriving some plot, and devising       mischief against the serjeants and the watch.         At one time he assembled three or four especial good hacksters and       roaring boys; made them in the evening drink like Templars,       afterwards led them till they came under St. Genevieve, or about       the college of Navarre, and, at the hour that the watch was coming       up that way,--which he knew by putting his sword upon the pavement,       and his ear by it, and, when he heard his sword shake, it was an       infallible sign that the watch was near at that instant,--then he       and his companions took a tumbrel or garbage-cart, and gave it the       brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and then       ran away upon the other side; for in less than two days he knew all       the streets, lanes, and turnings in Paris, as well as his _Deus       det._         At another time he laid, in some fair place where the said watch       was to pass, a train of gunpowder, and, at the very instant that       they went along, set fire to it, and then made himself sport to see       what good grace they had in running away, thinking that St.       Anthony's fire had caught them by the legs.... In one of his       pockets he had a great many little horns full of fleas and lice,       which he borrowed from the beggars of St. Innocent, and cast them,       with small canes or quills to write with, into the necks of the       daintiest gentlewomen that he could find, yea, even in the church;       for he never seated himself above in the choir, but always in the       body of the church amongst the women, both at mass, at vespers, and       at sermon.    Coleridge, in his metaphysical way, keen at the moment on the scent of  illustrations for the philosophy of Kant, said, \"Pantagruel is the  Reason; Panurge the Understanding.\" Rabelais himself, in the fourth book  of his romance, written in the last years of his life, defines the  spirit of the work. This fourth book, the English translator says, is  \"justly thought his masterpiece.\" The same authority adds with  enthusiasm, \"Being wrote with more spirit, salt, and flame than the  first part.\" Here, then, is Rabelais's own expression, sincere or  jocular, as you choose to take it, for what constitutes the essence of  his writing. We quote from the \"Prologue\":--         By the means of a little Pantagruelism (which, you know, is _a       certain jollity of mind, pickled in the scorn of fortune_), you see       me now [\"at near seventy years of age,\" his translator says], hale       and cheery, as sound as a bell, and ready to drink, if you will.    It is impossible to exaggerate the mad, rollicking humor, sticking at  nothing, either in thought or in expression, with which especially this  last book of Rabelais's work is written. But we have no more space for  quotation.    Coleridge's theory of interpretation for Rabelais's writings is hinted  in his \"Table Talk,\" as follows: \"After any particularly deep thrust,...  Rabelais, as if to break the blow, and to appear unconscious of what he  has done, writes a chapter or two of pure buffoonery.\"    The truth seems to us to be, that Rabelais's supreme taste, like his  supreme power, lay in the line of humorous satire. He hated monkery, and  he satirized the system as openly as he dared,--this, however, not so  much in the love of truth and freedom, as in pure fondness for  exercising his wit. That he was more than willing to make his ribald  drollery the fool's mask from behind which he might aim safely his  shafts of ridicule at what he despised and hated, is indeed probable.  But in this is supplied to him no sufficient excuse for his obscene and  blasphemous pleasantry. Nor yet are the manners of the age an excuse  sufficient. Erasmus belonged to the same age, and he disliked the monks  not less. But what a contrast, in point of decency, between Rabelais and  Erasmus!          IV.    MONTAIGNE.    1533-1592.      Montaigne is signally the author of one book. His \"Essays\" are the whole  of him. He wrote letters, to be sure, and he wrote journals of travel in  quest of health and pleasure. But these are chiefly void of interest.  Montaigne the Essayist alone is emphatically the Montaigne that  survives. \"Montaigne the Essayist,\"--that has become, as it were, a  personal name in literary history.    The \"Essays\" are one hundred and seven in number, divided into three  books. They are very unequal in length; and they are on the most various  topics,--topics often the most whimsical in character. We give a few of  his titles, taking them as found in Cotton's translation:--         That men by various ways arrive at the same end; Whether the       governor of a place ought himself to go out to parley; Of liars; Of       quick or slow speech; A proceeding of some ambassadors; Various       events from the same counsel; Of cannibals; That we laugh and cry       from the same thing; Of smells; That the mind hinders itself; Of       thumbs; Of virtue; Of coaches; Of managing the will; Of cripples;       Of experience.    Montaigne's titles cannot be trusted to indicate the nature of the  essays to which they belong. The author's pen will not be bound. It runs  on at its own pleasure. Things the most unexpected are incessantly  turning up in Montaigne,--things, probably, that were as unexpected to  the writer when he was writing, as they will be to the reader when he is  reading. The writing, on whatever topic, in whatever vein, always  revolves around the writer for its pivot. Montaigne, from no matter what  apparent diversion, may constantly be depended upon to bring up in due  time at himself. The tether is long and elastic, but it is tenacious,  and it is securely tied to Montaigne. This, as we shall presently let  the author himself make plain, is no accident, of which Montaigne was  unconscious. It is the express idea on which the \"Essays\" were written.  Montaigne, in his \"Essays,\" is a pure and perfect egotist, naked, and  not ashamed. Egotism is Montaigne's note, his _differentia_, in the  world of literature. Other literary men have been egotists--since. But  Montaigne may be called the first, and he is the greatest.    Montaigne was a Gascon, and Gasconisms adulterate the purity of his  French. But his style--a little archaic now, and never finished to the  nail--had virtues of its own which have exercised a wholesome influence  on classic French prose. It is simple, direct, manly, genuine. It is  fresh and racy of the writer. It is flexible to every turn, it is  sensitive to every rise or fall, of the thought. It is a steadfast  rebuke to rant and fustian. It quietly laughs to scorn the folly of that  style which writhes in an agony of expression, with neither thought nor  feeling present to be expressed. Montaigne's \"Essays\" have been a great  and a beneficent formative force in the development of prose style in  French.    For substance, Montaigne is rich in practical wisdom, his own by  original reflection, or by discreet purveyal. He had read much, he had  observed much, he had experienced much. The result of all, digested in  brooding thought, he put into his \"Essays.\" These grew as he grew. He  got himself transferred whole into them. Out of them, in turn, the world  has been busy ever since dissolving Montaigne. "]]]
