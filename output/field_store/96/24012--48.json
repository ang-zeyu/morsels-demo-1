CECIL          Ye little elves, who haunt sweet dells,      Where flowers with the dew commune,      I pray you hush the child, Cecil,          With windlike song.        O little elves, so white she lieth,      Each eyelid gentler than the flow'r      Of the bramble, and her fleecy hair          Like smoke of gold.        O little elves, her hands and feet      The angels muse upon, and God      Hath shut a glimpse of Paradise          In each blue eye.        O little elves, her tiny body      Like a white flake of snow it is,      Drooping upon the pale green hood          Of the chill snowdrop.        O little elves, with elderflower,      And pimpernel, and the white hawthorn,      Sprinkle the journey of her dreams:          And, little elves,        Call to her magically sweet,      Lest of her very tenderness      She do forsake this rough brown earth          And return to us no more.              I MET AT EVE          I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,      His was a still and lovely face,      He wandered through a valley steep        Lovely in a lonely place.        His garb was grey of lavender,      About his brows a poppy-wreath      Burned like dim coals, and everywhere        The air was sweeter for his breath.        His twilight feet no sandals wore,      His eyes shone faint in their own flame,      Fair moths that gloomed his steps before        Seemed letters of his lovely name.        His house is in the mountain ways,      A phantom house of misty walls,      Whose golden flocks at evening graze,        And witch the moon with muffled calls.        Upwelling from his shadowy springs      Sweet waters shake a trembling sound,      There flit the hoot-owl's silent wings,        There hath his web the silkworm wound.        Dark in his pools clear visions lurk,      And rosy, as with morning buds,      Along his dales of broom and birk        Dreams haunt his solitary woods.        I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,      His was a still and lovely face,      He wandered through a valley steep,        Lovely in a lonely place.              LULLABY          Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!      The singing mouse sings plaintively,      The sweet night-bird in the chesnut-tree--      They sing together, bird and mouse,      In starlight, in darkness, lonely, sweet,      The wild notes and the faint notes meet--        Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!        Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!      Amid the lilies floats the moth,      The mole along his galleries goeth      In the dark earth; the summer moon      Looks like a shepherd through the pane      Seeking his feeble lamb again--        Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!        Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!      Time comes to keep night-watch with thee      Nodding with roses; and the sea      Saith 'Peace! Peace!' amid his foam      White as thy night-clothes; 'O be still!'      The wind cries up the whisp'ring hill--        Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!              ENVOY          There clung three roses to a stem,      Did all their hues of summer don,      But came a wind and troubled them,        And all were gone.        I heard three bells in unison      Clap out some transient heart's delight,      Time and the hour brought silence on        And the dark night.        Doth not Orion even set!      O love, love, prove true alone,      Till youthful hearts ev'n love forget,        Then, child, begone!      Printed by T. and A.

Remain with this one during the  marriage week, then we will give you the other also for the service  which you shall give me during seven more years.\" Jacob did so: he  remained with Leah during the marriage week. Then Laban gave him Rachel  his daughter to be his wife, but Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah. So  he had to serve Laban seven years more.      MEETING A BROTHER WHO HAD BEEN WRONGED    In time Jacob became very wealthy, and he had large flocks, slaves, and  asses. But he heard Laban's sons say, \"Jacob has taken all that was our  father's, and from that which was our father's he has gotten all this  wealth.\" He also saw that Laban did not act toward him the same as  before. So Jacob rose and put his sons and his wives upon the camels and  drove away all his cattle. He deceived Laban, for he did not tell him  that he was fleeing away. So he fled across the river Euphrates, with  all that he had, and set out on his way toward Mount Gilead.    Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau. And he gave  them this command, \"Say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob declares, I  have lived with Laban and have stayed until now. I have oxen and asses,  flocks and slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may  win your favor.'\" The messengers returned to Jacob with the report, \"We  came to your brother Esau, even as he was coming to meet you with four  hundred men.\"    Then Jacob was greatly alarmed and worried. So he divided the people  that were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two  parts and said, \"If Esau comes to the one and attacks and destroys it,  then the other which is left can escape.\"    Jacob also prayed, \"O God of my father Abraham and God of my father  Isaac, deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the  hand of Esau, for I fear that he will come and attack me and kill the  mothers and the children.\"    Then Jacob took as a present for his brother Esau, two hundred female  goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty  milch camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female  asses and ten young asses. These he put, each drove by itself, in the  care of his servants and said to them, \"Go on before me and leave a  space between the droves.\"    He gave those in front this command: \"When my brother Esau meets you and  asks you, 'To whom do you belong? and where are you going? and whose are  these before you?' then you shall say, 'To your servant Jacob; it is a  present sent by him to my lord Esau; and Jacob himself is just behind  us.'\" Jacob also commanded the second, and the third, and all that  followed the droves, to make the same answer, and to say, \"Jacob himself  is just behind us.\" For he said to himself, \"I will please him with the  present that goes before me, and then, when I meet him, perhaps he will  welcome me.\" So he sent the present over before him; but he himself  spent that night in the camp.    Later that night he rose up and took his two wives, his two maid  servants, and his eleven children, and sent them over the river Jabbok.    Jacob was left alone, and one wrestled with him until daybreak. When he  saw that he did not win against Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip,  and the socket of Jacob's hip was strained, as he wrestled with him.  Then he said, \"Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.\" But Jacob replied,  \"I will not let thee go unless you bless me.\" So he said to him, \"What  is your name?\" He answered, \"Jacob.\" Then he said, \"Your name shall be  no longer Jacob, but Israel, which means Struggler with God; for you  have struggled with God and with men and have won.\" So he blessed him  there. And Jacob called the place Penuel, which means Face of God, for  he said, \"I have seen God face to face, and my life has been saved.\"    When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau coming with four hundred men. And he  put the maid servants and their children in front, Leah and her children  next, and Rachel and her son Joseph in the rear. Then Jacob himself went  in front of them, and he bowed down to the ground seven times, as he  drew near to his brother. Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms about his  neck, and kissed him, and they wept.    When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said, \"Who  are these with you?\" Jacob answered, \"The children whom God has so  kindly given me.\" Then the maid servants with their children came up and  bowed down to the ground. Leah and her children also came and bowed  down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed down before  Esau.    Esau asked, \"What do you mean by all this company which I met?\" Jacob  answered, \"To win your friendship, my lord.\" Esau said, \"I have enough,  my brother; keep what you have.\" But Jacob replied, \"No, if now I have  won your favor, receive this present from me to show that you are my  friend. Take, I beg of you, the gift that I bring to you, for God has  been generous to me, and I have enough.\" So he urged Esau until he took  it.    Then Esau said, \"Let me at least leave with you some of the people who  are with me.\" But Jacob replied, \"What need is there? Let me only enjoy  your friendship, my Lord.\" So Esau turned back that day on his way to  Seir.      JOSEPH SOLD AS A SLAVE BY HIS BROTHERS    When Joseph was seventeen years old, he and his brothers were shepherds,  but he made them angry, for he brought a bad report about them to their  father. Now Jacob loved his son Joseph, who was born in his old age; and  he made him a long coat with sleeves. When his brothers saw that their  father loved him more than all his other sons, they hated Joseph and  would not speak to him in a friendly way.    Joseph had a dream which he told to his brothers; and they hated him  still more. This is what he said to them, \"I dreamed that, as we were  binding sheaves in the field, my sheaf rose up and remained standing,  while your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf.\" His brothers  said to him, \"Will you really be king over us? Will you indeed rule over  us?\" So they hated him still more because of his dreams and his words.    Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, \"I have  had another dream, and it seemed to me that the sun and the moon and  eleven stars bowed down to me.\" But when he told it to his father and  his brothers, his father reproved him and said, \"What is this dream that  you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come  and bow down to the earth before you?\" Therefore his brothers were  jealous of him; but his father remembered the dream.    When his brothers went to pasture his father's flocks in Shechem, Jacob  said to Joseph, \"Go, see whether all goes well with your brothers and  with the flock, and bring me back word.\" So he sent him out, and a  certain man found him, as he was wandering in the field, and the man  asked him, \"What are you looking for?\" He said, \"I am looking for my  brothers; tell me, I beg of you, where they are pasturing the flock.\"  The man said, \"They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to  Dothan.'\" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.    When they saw him in the distance, before he came to them, they planned  together to kill him. And they said one to another, \"See, here comes  that great dreamer! Come, let us kill him and throw him into one of the  pits, and we will say, 'A fierce beast has devoured him.' Then we shall  see what will become of his dreams!\"    Judah, however, when he heard it, saved Joseph's life by saying, \"Let us  not take his life.\" Reuben also said to them, \"Do not shed blood; throw  him into this pit, here in the wilderness; but do not harm him.\" Reuben  said this to save Joseph from their hands so that he could bring him  back to his father. So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off  his long coat with sleeves and threw him into the pit. But the pit was  empty, there being no water in it.    Then they sat down to eat and, when they looked up, they saw a band of  Ishmaelites coming from Gilead; and their camels were loaded with  spices, gum, and ladanum on their way to carry it down to Egypt. And  Judah said to his brothers, \"What do we gain if we kill our brother and  hide his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us do  him no harm, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\" So his  brothers listened to him; and, drawing up Joseph, they sold him for  twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought him to Egypt.    Then his brothers took Joseph's long coat, killed a he-goat, dipped the  coat in the blood, and brought it to their father, and said, \"We found  this; see whether it is your son's coat or not.\" He recognized it and  said, \"It is my son's coat! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph surely  is torn in pieces.\" Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth about his  waist, and mourned for his son many days. All his sons and his daughters  tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, saying, \"I shall  go down to the grave mourning for my son.\" Thus Joseph's father mourned  for him.      JOSEPH'S EAGERNESS TO HELP OTHERS    Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an Egyptian, one of  Pharaoh's officers, the captain of the guard, bought him from the  Ishmaelites.    Now Jehovah was with Joseph, so that he prospered; and he was in the  house of his master, the Egyptian. When his master saw that Jehovah was  with him and made everything succeed that he undertook, he trusted him  and made him his own servant. He also made him overseer of his household  and placed all that he had in his care. From the time that he made him  overseer in his house and over all that he had, Jehovah blessed the  Egyptian's household for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of Jehovah was  upon all that he had in"]]]
