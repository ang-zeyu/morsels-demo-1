On he  goes along the northern spur, his voice rising and sinking as the wind  and the lay of the ground modify it, till lost to hearing.    The fox usually keeps half a mile ahead, regulating his speed by that of  the hound, occasionally pausing a moment to divert himself with a mouse,  or to contemplate the landscape, or to listen for his pursuer. If the  hound press him too closely, he leads off from mountain to mountain, and  so generally escapes the hunter; but if the pursuit be slow, he plays  about some ridge or peak, and falls a prey, though not an easy one, to  the experienced sportsman.    A most spirited and exciting chase occurs when the farm-dog gets close  upon one in the open field, as sometimes happens in the early morning.  The fox relies so confidently upon his superior speed, that I imagine  he half tempts the dog to the race. But if the dog be a smart one, and  their course lies down hill, over smooth ground, Reynard must put his  best foot forward, and then sometimes suffer the ignominy of being run  over by his pursuer, who, however, is quite unable to pick him up, owing  to the speed. But when they mount the hill, or enter the woods, the  superior nimbleness and agility of the fox tell at once, and he easily  leaves the dog far in his rear. For a cur less than his own size he  manifests little fear, especially if the two meet alone, remote from the  house. In such cases, I have seen first one turn tail, then the other.    One of the most notable features of the fox is his large and massive  tail. Seen running on the snow at a distance, his tail is quite as  conspicuous as his body; and, so far from appearing a burden, seems to  contribute to his lightness and buoyancy. It softens the outline of his  movements, and repeats or continues to the eye the ease and poise of his  carriage. But, pursued by the hound on a wet, thawy day, it often  becomes so heavy and bedraggled as to prove a serious inconvenience, and  compels him to take refuge in his den. He is very loath to do this; both  his pride and the traditions of his race stimulate him to run it out,  and win by fair superiority of wind and speed; and only a wound or a  heavy and moppish tail will drive him to avoid the issue in this manner.    To learn his surpassing shrewdness and cunning, attempt to take him with  a trap. Rogue that he is, he always suspects some trick, and one must be  more of a fox than he is himself to overreach him. At first sight it  would appear easy enough. With apparent indifference he crosses your  path, or walks in your footsteps in the field, or travels along the  beaten highway, or lingers in the vicinity of stacks and remote barns.  Carry the carcass of a pig, or a fowl, or a dog, to a distant field in  midwinter, and in a few nights his tracks cover the snow about it.    The inexperienced country youth, misled by this seeming carelessness of  Reynard, suddenly conceives a project to enrich himself with fur, and  wonders that the idea has not occurred to him before, and to others. I  knew a youthful yeoman of this kind, who imagined he had found a mine of  wealth on discovering on a remote side-hill, between two woods, a dead  porker, upon which it appeared all the foxes of the neighborhood did  nightly banquet. The clouds were burdened with snow; and as the first  flakes commenced to eddy down, he set out, trap and broom in hand,  already counting over in imagination the silver quarters he would  receive for his first fox-skin. With the utmost care, and with a  palpitating heart, he removed enough of the trodden snow to allow the  trap to sink below the surface. Then, carefully sifting the light  element over it and sweeping his tracks full, he quickly withdrew,  laughing exultingly over the little surprise he had prepared for the  cunning rogue. The elements conspired to aid him, and the falling snow  rapidly obliterated all vestiges of his work. The next morning at dawn  he was on his way to bring in his fur. The snow had done its work  effectually, and, he believed, had kept his secret well. Arrived in  sight of the locality, he strained his vision to make out his prize  lodged against the fence at the foot of the hill. Approaching nearer,  the surface was unbroken, and doubt usurped the place of certainty in  his mind. A slight mound marked the site of the porker, but there was no  footprint near it. Looking up the hill, he saw where Reynard had walked  leisurely down toward his wonted bacon till within a few yards of it,  when he had wheeled, and with prodigious strides disappeared in the  woods. The young trapper saw at a glance what a comment this was upon  his skill in the art, and, indignantly exhuming the iron, he walked home  with it, the stream of silver quarters suddenly setting in another  direction.    The successful trapper commences in the fall, or before the first deep  snow. In a field not too remote, with an old axe he cuts a small place,  say ten inches by fourteen, in the frozen ground, and removes the earth  to the depth of three or four inches, then fills the cavity with dry  ashes, in which are placed bits of roasted cheese. Reynard is very  suspicious at first, and gives the place a wide berth. It looks like  design, and he will see how the thing behaves before he approaches too  near. But the cheese is savory and the cold severe. He ventures a little  closer every night, until he can reach and pick a piece from the  surface. Emboldened by success, like other mortals, he presently digs  freely among the ashes, and, finding a fresh supply of the delectable  morsels every night, is soon thrown off his guard and his suspicions  quite lulled. After a week of baiting in this manner, and on the eve of  a light fall of snow, the trapper carefully conceals his trap in the  bed, first smoking it thoroughly with hemlock boughs to kill or  neutralize all smell of the iron. If the weather favors and the proper  precautions have been taken, he may succeed, though the chances are  still greatly against him.    Reynard is usually caught very lightly, seldom more than the ends of his  toes being between the jaws. He sometimes works so cautiously as to  spring the trap without injury even to his toes, or may remove the  cheese night after night without even springing it. I knew an old  trapper who, on finding himself outwitted in this manner, tied a bit of  cheese to the pan, and next morning had poor Reynard by the jaw. The  trap is not fastened, but only incumbered with a clog, and is all the  more sure in its hold by yielding to every effort of the animal to  extricate himself.    When Reynard sees his captor approaching, he would fain drop into a  mouse-hole to render himself invisible. He crouches to the ground and  remains perfectly motionless until he perceives himself discovered, when  he makes one desperate and final effort to escape, but ceases all  struggling as you come up, and behaves in a manner that stamps him a  very timid warrior,--cowering to the earth with a mingled look of shame,  guilt, and humiliation. A young farmer told me of tracing one with his  trap to the border of a wood, where he discovered the cunning rogue  trying to hide by embracing a small tree. Most animals, when taken in a  trap, show fight; but Reynard has more faith in the nimbleness of his  feet than in the terror of his teeth.    I once spent a summer month in a mountainous district in the State of  New York, where, from its earliest settlement, the red fox has been the  standing prize for skill in the use of the trap and gun. At the house  where I was stopping were two foxhounds, and a neighbor half a mile  distant had a third. There were many others in the township, and in  season they were well employed, too; but the three spoken of, attended  by their owners, held high carnival on the mountains in the immediate  vicinity. And many were the foxes that, winter after winter, fell before  them, twenty-five having been shot, the season before my visit, on one  small range alone. And yet the foxes were apparently never more abundant  than they were that summer, and never bolder, coming at night within a  few rods of the house and of the unchained alert hounds, and making  havoc among the poultry.    One morning a large, fat goose was found minus her head and otherwise  mangled. Both hounds had disappeared, and, as they did not come back  till near night, it was inferred that they had cut short Reynard's  repast, and given him a good chase into the bargain. But next night he  was back again, and this time got safely off with the goose. A couple of  nights after he must have come with recruits, for next morning three  large goslings were reported missing. The silly geese now got it  through their noddles that there was danger about, and every night  thereafter came close up to the house to roost.    A brood of turkeys, the old one tied to a tree a few rods to the rear of  the house, were the next objects of attack. The predaceous rascal came,  as usual, in the latter half of the night. I happened to be awake, and  heard the helpless turkey cry \"Quit, quit,\" with great emphasis. Another  sleeper, on the floor above me, who, it seems, had been sleeping with  one ear awake for several nights in apprehension for the safety of his  turkeys, heard the sound also, and instantly divined its cause. I heard  the window open and a voice summon the dogs. A loud bellow was the  response, which caused Reynard to take himself off in a hurry. A moment  more, and the mother turkey would have shared the fate of the geese.  There she lay at the end of her tether, with extended wings, bitten and  rumpled. The young ones roosted in a row on the fence near by, and had  taken flight on the first alarm.    Turkeys, retaining many of their wild instincts, are less easily  captured by the fox than any other of our domestic fowls. On the  slightest show of danger they take to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24389"],[0,"Blue-Bird Weather (#8)"],[1,"he touched her hands with his lips, she watching him palely, out  of clear, gray eyes; then, as they turned away together, he encircled  her slender waist with his arm.    That she was conscious of it, and not disturbed by it, was part of her  new mystery to him. Only once, as they walked, when his circling clasp  tightened, did she rest her own hand over his where it held her body  imprisoned. But she said nothing; nor had he spoken when the belt of  pines loomed against the stars once more.    Then, though neither had spoken, they stopped. He turned to face her,  drew her into his arms, and the beating of his heart almost suffocated  him as he looked into her eyes, clear, unshrinking eyes of gray, with a  child's question in their starry depths.    And he answered the question as in a dream: \"I love you. I want you for  my wife. I want you to love me. You are the first woman I have cared  for. All that you are I want--no more than you are. You, as you are now,  are all that I care for in the world. Life is young for us both, yet.  Let us grow up together--if you can love me. Can you?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Can you not care for me a little, Molly?\"    \"I do. I know--nothing about--love--real love.\"    \"Can you not imagine it, dear?\"    \"I--it is what I _have_ imagined--a man--like you--coming this way into  my loneliness. I recognize it. I have dreamed that it was like this.  What is it that I should do--if this is really to come true?\"    \"Love me.\"    \"I would--if I knew how. I don't know how,\" she said wistfully. \"My  heart is so full--already--of your goodness--I--and then this dream I  have dreamed--that a man like you should come here and say this to  me----\"    \"Is it in you to love me?\"    \"I'll try--if you'll tell me what to do--how to show it--to  understand----\"    He drew her closer, unresisting, and looked deep into her young eyes,  and kissed them, and then her lips, till they grew warmer and her breath  came fragrant and uneven.    \"Can you love me?\"    \"Yes,\" she whispered.    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Y-yes.\"    For a moment's exquisite silence she rested her flushed face against his  shoulder, then lifted it, averted, and stepped aside, out of the circle  of his arms. Head lowered, she stood there, motionless in the starlight,  arms hanging straight; then, as he came to her, she lifted her proud  little head and laid both her hands in his.    \"Of those things,\" she said, \"that a woman should be to the man she  loves, and say to that man, I am ignorant. Even how to speak to  you--now--I do not know. It is all a dream to me--except that, in my  heart, I know that I do love you. But I think that was so from the  beginning, and after you have gone away I should have realized it some  day.\"    \"You darling!\" he whispered. Again she surrendered to him, exquisite in  her ignorance, passive at first, then tremulously responsive. And at  last her head drooped and fell on his shoulder, and he held her for a  little longer, then released her.    Trembling, she crept up the stairway to her room, treading lightly  along the dark entry, dazed, fatigued, with the wonder of it all. Then,  as she laid her hand on the knob of her bedroom door, the door of her  father's room opened abruptly.    \"Molly?\"    \"Yes, dear,\" she answered vaguely.    He stood staring at her on the threshold, fully dressed, and she looked  back at him, her eyes slightly confused by the light.    \"Where have you been?\" he said.    \"With Mr. Marche.\"    \"Where?\"    \"To the dory--and back.\"    \"What did he say to you, child?\"    She came silently across the threshold and put her arms around his neck;  and the man lost every atom of his color.    \"What did he say?\" he repeated harshly.    \"That he loves me.\"    \"What!\"    \"It is true, father.\"    The man held her at arm's length roughly. \"Good God!\" he groaned, \"how  long has this been going on?\"    \"Only to-night. What do you mean, father?\"    [Illustration: \"'He tells you that he--he is in love with you?'\"]    \"He tells you that he--he is in love with you? With _you_?\" repeated  Herold unsteadily.    \"Yes. It is true, too.\"    \"You mean he asked you to marry him!\"    \"Yes. And I said I would.\"    \"_You_ love _him_!\"    The man's pallor frightened her silent. Then he dropped her arms, which  he had been clutching, and stood staring at nothing, gnawing at his  colorless lips.    The girl watched him with dawning terror and finally ventured to speak.  \"Dear, what is the matter? Are you displeased with me? Do you think that  he is not a man I should care for? You don't know him, dear. You have  only to see him, to speak with him, hear his voice, look into his  eyes----\"    \"Good God!\" groaned Herold, closing his sunken eyes. Then, almost  feeling his way out and along the dark passageway, he descended the  stairs, heavily.    Marche, cleaning his gun in the sitting-room, looked up in surprise,  then rose, laying aside stock, fore-end, and barrel, as Herold came into  the room. The next instant, stepping nearer, he stared into Herold's  face in silence. And so they met and confronted each other after many  years.    \"Are _you_ Herold?\" said the young man, in a low voice.    \"That is my name--now.\"    \"_You_ have been in my employment--for five years?\"    \"Yes. Judge Gilkins gave me the chance. I could not suppose that the  club would ever become your property.\"    The younger man's face hardened. \"But when it did become my property,  why had you the indecency to stay?\"    \"Where else could I go?\"    \"You had the whole world to--operate in.\"    Herold's thin face flushed. \"It was fitter that I should work for you,\"  he said. \"I have served you faithfully for five years.\"    \"And unfaithfully for ten! Wasn't it enough that Vyse and I let you go  without prosecuting you? Wasn't it enough that we pocketed our loss for  your wife's sake?\"    He checked himself in a flash of memory, turned, and looked at the  picture on the wall. Now he knew, now he understood why his former  associate's handwriting had seemed familiar after all these years.    And suddenly he remembered that this man was Jim's father--and the  father of the young girl he was in love with; and the shock drove every  drop of blood out of his heart and cheeks. Ghastly, staring, he stood  confronting Herold; and the latter, leaning heavily, shoulder against  the wall, stared back at him.    \"I could have gone on working for you,\" he said, \"trying to save enough  to make restitution--some day. I _have_ already saved part of it. Look  at me--look at my children--at the way we live, and you'll understand  how I have saved. But I _have_ saved part of what I took. I'll give you  that much before you go--before I go, too.\"    His breath came heavily, unevenly; he cleared his eyes with a  work-stained hand, fashioned for pens and ledgers.    \"You were abroad when I--did what I did. Vyse was merciless. I told him  I could put it back if he'd give me the chance. But a thief was a thief  to him--particularly when his own pocket was involved. He meant to send  me to prison. The judge held him--he was his father-in-law--and he was  an old man with a wife and children of his own.\"    Herold was silent for a moment, and his gaze became vague and remote,  then he lifted his head sharply:    \"A man makes one slip like that and the world damns him forever. And I  tell you, Marche, that I am not dishonest by nature or in my character.  God alone knows why I took those securities, meaning, of course, to  return them, as all the poor, damned fools do mean when they do what I  did. But Vyse made it a condition that I was to leave the country, and  there was no chance of restitution unless I could remain in New York and  do what I knew how to do--no chance, Marche--and so fortune ebbed, and  my wife died, and the old judge saw me working on the water-front in  Norfolk one day, and gave me this place. That is all.\"    \"Why did you feign illness?\" asked Marche, in an altered voice.    \"You know why.\"    \"You thought I'd discharge you?\"    \"Of course.\"    Marche stepped nearer. \"Why did you come to me here to-night?\"    Herold flushed deeply. \"It was your right to know--and my daughter's  right--before she broke her heart.\"    \"I see. You naturally suppose that I would scarcely care to marry the  daughter of a----\" He stopped short, and Herold set his teeth.    \"Say it,\" he said, \"and let this end matters for all of us. Except that  I have saved seven thousand dollars toward--what I took. I will draw you  a check for it now.\"    He walked steadily to the table, laid out a thin checkbook, and with his  fountain-pen wrote out a check for seven thousand dollars on a Norfolk  bank.    \"There you are, Marche,\" he said wearily. \"I made most of it buying and  selling pine timber in this district. It seemed a little like expiation,  too, working here for you, unknown to you. I won't stay, now, of course.  I'll try to pay back the rest--little by little--somehow.\"    \"The way to pay it back,\" said Marche, \"is to do the work you are fitted  for.\"    Herold looked up. \"How can I?\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I could not go back to New York. I have no money to go with, even if I  could find a place for myself again.\"    \"Your place is open to you.\"    Herold stared at him.    Marche repeated the assertion profanely. \"Damnation,\" he said, \"if you'd  talked this way to me five years ago, I'd never have stood in your way.  All I heard of the matter was what Vyse told me. I'm not associated with  him any more; I'll stand for his minding his own affairs. The thing for  you to do, Courtney, is to get into the game again and clean up what you  owe Vyse. Here's seven thousand; you can borrow the rest from me. And  then we'll go into things again and hustle. It was a good combination,  Courtney--we'd have been rich men--except for the slip you made. Come on  in with me again. Or would you rather continue to inhabit your own  private hell?\"    \"Do you know what you are saying, Marche?\" said "]]]
