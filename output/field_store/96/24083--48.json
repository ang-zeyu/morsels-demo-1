Baron  Edmund's refusal to cooperate carried with it the refusal of the Baron  de Hirsch Fund and of the circle of leading Jews in London.    Reluctantly, Herzl came to the conclusion that there was only one  reply to this situation. The Jewish masses must be organized for the  support of the Zionist movement.    The organization he had in mind was not a popular democratic  organization. What he meant was to assemble the upper \"cadres\" to take  charge of the organization of the masses for the great migration. At  the same time, he wanted to prove to the philanthropists that a  popular organization was possible. He felt that they would be greatly  influenced by the development of a widespread popular movement.  Whatever his thoughts were at that time, his decision to turn to the  Jewish masses, to abandon reliance upon the wealthy led to the  organization of the modern Zionist movement.    He organized his followers in Vienna. He was the center of a circle in  which were included the men who later became the members of the first  Zionist Actions Committee. In November 1896 he, for the first time,  addressed a public meeting in Vienna. In this address he did not use  the term \"The Jewish State,\" nor did he use it in most of his public  utterances at that time. He had become cautious. He did not want to  prejudice his political work in Constantinople.    He was still thinking of issuing a newspaper, but there were no funds  for that purpose. The report that he intended to issue a newspaper  drew the attention of a number of personalities and groups in Berlin.  There were the Russian Jewish students, led by Leo Motzkin, and a  group called \"Young Israel,\" headed by Reinrich Loewe. A conference  was held on March 6 and 7, 1897, called by Dr. Osias Thon Willy Bambus  and Nathan Birnbaum. They had come together to talk about a newspaper  but the First Zionist Congress was launched at this meeting Herzl's  proposal for the calling of a General Zionist Conference in Munich was  agreed to. In the preliminary announcement of the calling of this  Conference or Congress, Herzl said:    \"The Jewish question must be removed from the control of the  benevolent individual. There must be created a forum before which  everyone acting for the Jewish people should appear and to which he  should be responsible.\"    Every one of Herzl's ideas was met by protests and public excitement.  The protests were usually launched by Jews. The calling of the  Congress aroused a great deal of indignation in conservative circles.  The Rabbis of Germany protested not only to the holding of the  Congress but also the choice of Munich.    The Congress controversy persuaded Herzl to begin the publication of  the weekly Die Welt. The first issue appeared on June 4, 1897, Herzl  provided the funds. The journal was something new in Jewish life. It  was, in fact, the organ of the Congress. Throughout Herzl's life, Die  Welt served as the exponent of his ideas. At first, Herzl contributed  numerous articles. He sent in a regular weekly review of all  activities connected with the movement. He was responsible for many  unsigned articles and notices. He directed the paper in all its  details, although he refused to figure as its official editor and  publisher. The amount of work he did during the months preceding the  Congress was amazing. He was completely absorbed in every aspect of  the Congress. The man of the pen revealed himself as a first-class man  of action.    On August 29, 1897, the First Zionist Congress was assembled, not in  Munich but in Basle, Switzerland. The majority of the delegates to the  First Zionist Congress, drawn to Basle from all parts of the world,  saw Herzl for the first time. The total number of delegates at the  first session was 197.    The first act of the Congress was the adoption of a resolution of  thanks to the Sultan of Turkey. Then Herzl rose and walked over to the  pulpit. It was no longer the elegant Dr. Herzl of Vienna, it was no  longer the easy-going literary man, the critic, the feuilletonist. As  one reporter said: \"It was a scion of the House of David, risen from  among the dead, clothed in legend and fantasy and beauty.\" The first  words uttered by Herzl were: \"We are here to lay the foundation stone  of the house which is to shelter the Jewish nation.\" \"We Zionists,\" he  stressed, \"seek for the solution of the Jewish question, not an  international society, but an international discussion.... We have  nothing to do with conspiracy, secret intervention or indirect  methods. We wish to place the question under the control of free  public opinion.\"    His First Congress address contained the ideas which he had already  expressed in previous speeches and articles, but there was a great  difference between the views in \"The Jewish State\" and the address  delivered at the first session of the Zionist Congress. The latter is  the carefully considered public statement of one who knew he  represented tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of  followers. His words were not those of a seer, but of a statesman.  Almost as profound was the effect produced. It was at this Congress  that the Basle Program was adopted.... \"Zionism seeks to secure for  the Jewish people a publicly recognized, legally secured home (or  homeland) in Palestine.\"    The second important task of the First Congress was the creation of an  organization. The Congress was declared to be \"the chief organ of the  Zionist movement.\" The basis of electoral right was to be the payment  of a shekel, which at that time was equivalent to twenty-five cents.  There was to be an Executive Committee with its permanent seat in  Vienna. Everything which was to unfold later in Zionism, both in the  way of affirmative forces and inner contradictions, was already  visible or latent in the first Congress. There was discussion of a  bank, of a land redemption fund to be called The National Fund, the  creation of a Hebrew University, and the clashes between practical and  political Zionism.    On his return to Vienna, Herzl made the following entry in his diary:  \"If I were to sum up the Basle Congress in a single phrase I would  say: In Basle I created the Jewish State. Were I to say this aloud I  would be greeted by universal laughter. But perhaps five years hence,  in any case, certainly fifty years hence, everyone will perceive it.  The state exists as essence in the will-to-the-state of a people, yes,  even in that will in a single powerful person.... The territory is  only the concrete basis, and the state itself, with a territory  beneath it, is still in the nature of an abstract thing ... In Basle I  created the abstraction which, as such, is invisible to the great  majority.\"    All that Herzl did in the political field--his conversations in  Constantinople, his interview with the Grand Duke of Baden in advance  of the holding of the First Congress, was undertaken as author of a  political pamphlet. He was now aware of the fact that he was called  upon to act as President of the World Zionist Organization. It was  difficult to draw a line between the movement and its leader. Herzl  insisted that his leadership in the movement was impersonal and that  now its direction was vested in its instruments--the Congress and the  Actions Committee. But he had all the authority of an accepted leader.    The evolution of Herzl's conception of the Jewish problem since he saw  the degradation of Dreyfus can be measured by a study of the articles  he wrote after the First Congress. He himself was quite aware of the  transformation. He had seen the Jewish people face to face. \"Brothers  have found each other again,\" he said. He wrote with great  appreciation of the quality of the Russian delegates. He said, \"They  possess that inner unity which has disappeared from among the  westerners. They are steeped in Jewish national sentiment without  betraying any national narrowness and intolerance. They are not  tortured by the idea of assimilation. They do not assimilate into  other nations, but exert themselves to learn the best in other  peoples. In this way they manage to remain erect and genuine. Looking  on them, we understood where our forefathers got the strength to  endure through the bitterest times.\"    Immediately after the First Congress, Herzl grappled with his second  task, the creation of the Jewish Colonial Bank. He wrote of the bank  in _Die Welt_ in November, 1898, \"The task of the Colonial Bank is to  eliminate philanthropy. The settler on the land who increases its  value by his labor merits more than a gift. He is entitled to credit.  The prospective bank could therefore begin by extending the needed  credits to the colonists; later it would expand into the instrument  for the bringing in of Jews and would supply credits for  transportation, agriculture, commerce and construction.\"    The seat of the bank was to be London. There were to be two billion  shares at L1 each. The bank was to be directed by men acquainted with  banking affairs, but the movement would be placed in a position to  control its policy. The hopes of Herzl grew from week to week. As he  approached the practical situation he became less and less confident  of the cooperation of men of wealth. Differences arose in the  preliminary discussions as to the scope of the bank. In the first  draft of the Articles of Incorporation the Orient alone was named as  the area of work for the bank. Menachem Ussishkin insisted that the  words \"Syria and Palestine\" should be substituted. After a great deal  of discussion, the proposals for the formation of the bank were  brought to the second Zionist Congress and the Articles of  Incorporation, as amended, were adopted by acclamation.    Herzl clung to the idea which had come to him when he was thinking of  the Jewish State as a pamphlet, that it might be better for him to  write a novel."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#8)"],[1,"to a sensational stimulus differ, however, in  many respects. The closure of the eye and the lachrymation are quite  involuntary, and so is the disturbance of the heart. Such involuntary  responses we know as 'reflex' acts. The motion of the arms to break the  shock of falling may also be called reflex, since it occurs too quickly  to be deliberately intended. Whether it be instinctive or whether it  result from the pedestrian education of childhood may be doubtful; it  is, at any rate, less automatic than the previous acts, for a man might  by conscious effort learn to perform it more skilfully, or even to  suppress it altogether. Actions of this kind, with which instinct and  volition enter upon equal terms, have been called 'semi-reflex.' The  act of running towards the train, on the other hand, has no instinctive  element about it. It is purely the result of education, and is preceded  by a consciousness of the purpose to be attained and a distinct mandate  of the will. It is a 'voluntary act.' Thus the animal's reflex and  voluntary performances shade into each other gradually, being connected  by acts which may often occur automatically, but may also be modified by  conscious intelligence.    \"An outside observer, unable to perceive the accompanying consciousness,  might be wholly at a loss to discriminate between the automatic acts and  those which volition escorted. But if the criterion of mind's existence  be the choice of the proper means for the attainment of a supposed  end, all the acts alike seem to be inspired by intelligence, for  APPROPRIATENESS characterizes them all alike.\"    There is one movement, among those that James mentions at first, which  is not subsequently classified, namely, the stumbling. This is the  kind of movement which may be called \"mechanical\"; it is evidently of a  different kind from either reflex or voluntary movements, and more akin  to the movements of dead matter. We may define a movement of an animal's  body as \"mechanical\" when it proceeds as if only dead matter were  involved. For example, if you fall over a cliff, you move under the  influence of gravitation, and your centre of gravity describes just as  correct a parabola as if you were already dead. Mechanical movements  have not the characteristic of appropriateness, unless by accident, as  when a drunken man falls into a waterbutt and is sobered. But reflex  and voluntary movements are not ALWAYS appropriate, unless in some very  recondite sense. A moth flying into a lamp is not acting sensibly; no  more is a man who is in such a hurry to get his ticket that he cannot  remember the name of his destination. Appropriateness is a complicated  and merely approximate idea, and for the present we shall do well to  dismiss it from our thoughts.    As James states, there is no difference, from the point of view of  the outside observer, between voluntary and reflex movements. The  physiologist can discover that both depend upon the nervous system,  and he may find that the movements which we call voluntary depend upon  higher centres in the brain than those that are reflex. But he  cannot discover anything as to the presence or absence of \"will\" or  \"consciousness,\" for these things can only be seen from within, if  at all. For the present, we wish to place ourselves resolutely in the  position of outside observers; we will therefore ignore the distinction  between voluntary and reflex movements. We will call the two together  \"vital\" movements. We may then distinguish \"vital\" from mechanical  movements by the fact that vital movements depend for their causation  upon the special properties of the nervous system, while mechanical  movements depend only upon the properties which animal bodies share with  matter in general.    There is need for some care if the distinction between mechanical and  vital movements is to be made precise. It is quite likely that, if we  knew more about animal bodies, we could deduce all their movements from  the laws of chemistry and physics. It is already fairly easy to see how  chemistry reduces to physics, i.e. how the differences between different  chemical elements can be accounted for by differences of physical  structure, the constituents of the structure being electrons which are  exactly alike in all kinds of matter. We only know in part how to reduce  physiology to chemistry, but we know enough to make it likely that the  reduction is possible. If we suppose it effected, what would become of  the difference between vital and mechanical movements?    Some analogies will make the difference clear. A shock to a mass of  dynamite produces quite different effects from an equal shock to a mass  of steel: in the one case there is a vast explosion, while in the other  case there is hardly any noticeable disturbance. Similarly, you may  sometimes find on a mountain-side a large rock poised so delicately that  a touch will set it crashing down into the valley, while the rocks all  round are so firm that only a considerable force can dislodge them What  is analogous in these two cases is the existence of a great store of  energy in unstable equilibrium ready to burst into violent motion by  the addition of a very slight disturbance. Similarly, it requires only  a very slight expenditure of energy to send a post-card with the words  \"All is discovered; fly!\" but the effect in generating kinetic energy  is said to be amazing. A human body, like a mass of dynamite, contains  a store of energy in unstable equilibrium, ready to be directed in this  direction or that by a disturbance which is physically very small,  such as a spoken word. In all such cases the reduction of behaviour to  physical laws can only be effected by entering into great minuteness; so  long as we confine ourselves to the observation of comparatively  large masses, the way in which the equilibrium will be upset cannot be  determined. Physicists distinguish between macroscopic and microscopic  equations: the former determine the visible movements of bodies of  ordinary size, the latter the minute occurrences in the smallest parts.  It is only the microscopic equations that are supposed to be the same  for all sorts of matter. The macroscopic equations result from a process  of averaging out, and may be different in different cases. So, in our  instance, the laws of macroscopic phenomena are different for mechanical  and vital movements, though the laws of microscopic phenomena may be the  same.    We may say, speaking somewhat roughly, that a stimulus applied to the  nervous system, like a spark to dynamite, is able to take advantage of  the stored energy in unstable equilibrium, and thus to produce movements  out of proportion to the proximate cause. Movements produced in this way  are vital movements, while mechanical movements are those in which the  stored energy of a living body is not involved. Similarly dynamite may  be exploded, thereby displaying its characteristic properties, or may  (with due precautions) be carted about like any other mineral. The  explosion is analogous to vital movements, the carting about to  mechanical movements.    Mechanical movements are of no interest to the psychologist, and it has  only been necessary to define them in order to be able to exclude them.  When a psychologist studies behaviour, it is only vital movements  that concern him. We shall, therefore, proceed to ignore mechanical  movements, and study only the properties of the remainder.    The next point is to distinguish between movements that are instinctive  and movements that are acquired by experience. This distinction also is  to some extent one of degree. Professor Lloyd Morgan gives the following  definition of \"instinctive behaviour\":    \"That which is, on its first occurrence, independent of prior  experience; which tends to the well-being of the individual and the  preservation of the race; which is similarly performed by all members  of the same more or less restricted group of animals; and which may be  subject to subsequent modification under the guidance of experience.\" *         * \"Instinct and Experience\" (Methuen, 1912) p. 5.    This definition is framed for the purposes of biology, and is in  some respects unsuited to the needs of psychology. Though perhaps  unavoidable, allusion to \"the same more or less restricted group  of animals\" makes it impossible to judge what is instinctive in the  behaviour of an isolated individual. Moreover, \"the well-being of  the individual and the preservation of the race\" is only a usual  characteristic, not a universal one, of the sort of movements that, from  our point of view, are to be called instinctive; instances of harmful  instincts will be given shortly. The essential point of the definition,  from our point of view, is that an instinctive movement is in dependent  of prior experience.    We may say that an \"instinctive\" movement is a vital movement performed  by an animal the first time that it finds itself in a novel situation;  or, more correctly, one which it would perform if the situation were  novel.* The instincts of an animal are different at different periods of  its growth, and this fact may cause changes of behaviour which are  not due to learning. The maturing and seasonal fluctuation of the  sex-instinct affords a good illustration. When the sex-instinct first  matures, the behaviour of an animal in the presence of a mate is  different from its previous behaviour in similar circumstances, but is  not learnt, since it is just the same if the animal has never previously  been in the presence of a mate.         * Though this can only be decided by comparison with other       members of the species, and thus exposes us to the need of       comparison which we thought an objection to Professor Lloyd       Morgan's definition.    On the other hand, a movement is \"learnt,\" or embodies a \"habit,\" if it  is due to previous experience of similar situations,"]]]
