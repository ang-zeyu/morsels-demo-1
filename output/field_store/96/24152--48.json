In the winter of '66, when she was on the point, for want of  further means to carry out her plan, of turning the search over to the  Government, Congress voted $15,000 for reimbursing moneys expended,  and carrying on the work. The search was continued until 1869, and  then a full report made and accepted by Congress. During the winter of  1867-8 Miss Barton was called on to lecture before many lyceums  regarding the incidents of the war.    In 1869, her health failing, she went to Switzerland to rest and  recover, where she was at the breaking out of the Franco-Prussian  war, and immediately tendered her services there, as here, on the  battle-field, under the auspices of the Red Cross of Geneva. Her Royal  Highness the Grand Duchess of Baden, daughter of the Emperor of  Germany, invited Miss Barton to aid her in the establishment of her  noble Badise hospitals, a work which consumed several months. On the  fall of Strasburg she entered the city with the German army, organized  labor for women, conducting the enterprise herself, employing  remuneratively a great number, and clothing over thirty thousand. She  entered Metz with hospital supplies the day of its fall, and Paris the  day after the fall of the Commune. Here she remained two months,  distributing money and clothing which she carried, and afterward met  the poor in every besieged city in France, extending succor to them.    She is a representative of the \"International Red Cross of Geneva,\"  and President of the American National Association of the Red Cross,  honorary and only woman member of \"Comite de Strasbourgeois\"; was  decorated with the \"Gold Cross of Remembrance\" by the Grand Duke and  Duchess of Baden, and with the \"Iron Cross of Merit\" by the Emperor  and Empress of Germany.    Miss Barton may be said to have given her whole life to humanitarian  affairs, largely national in character. The positions she has  occupied, whether remunerative or not--and she has filled but few paid  positions--have been pioneer ones, in which her efforts and success  have been to raise the standard of woman's work and its recognition  and remuneration. Her time, her property, and her influence have been  held sacred to benevolence of that character that will assist in true  progress. Nevertheless, she is one of the most retiring of women,  never voluntarily coming before the world except at the call of  manifest duty, and shrinking with peculiar sensitiveness from anything  verging on notoriety.    Her summers are passed at her pleasant country residence at Dansville,  New York, where she has regained in a most gratifying degree her  shattered health and war-worn strength, and her winters in Washington  in the interests and charge of the great International movement which  she represents in America.      JOSEPHINE SOPHIE GRIFFING.    _The National Freedman's Relief Association._    BY CATHARINE A. F. STEBBINS.    Josephine Sophie White was born at Hebron, Conn., December, 1816, and  was educated in her native State. She grew to young womanhood in the  pure and religious atmosphere of the New England hills, and developed  a strength of constitution and character which was the basis of her  truly beneficent life-work. Refined, sympathetic, and conscientious,  with the golden rule for her text, her career was ever marked with  deeds of kindness and charity to the oppressed of every class. Taking  an active part in both the \"Anti-slavery\" and \"Woman's Rights\"  struggles, she early learned the very alphabet of liberty. With her  the perception of its blessings and its glory was also a rich  inheritance, and the vigilance and courage to conquer and secure it  for others was not less a noble legacy. The love of liberty flowed  down to her through two streams of life. On the mother's side she was  descended from Peter Waldo[25], after whom the Waldenses were named;  and on the father's, from Peregrine White, who was born in  Massachusetts in 1620, the first child of Pilgrim parents. It is not  strange she was by temperament and constitution a reformer, and a  protestant against all despotisms, whether of mind, body, or estate.  In the agitation for human rights of one class after another, in their  historical order, she enlisted with the Abolitionists, with the Woman  Suffragists, with the Loyal League and sanitary workers, and after the  war, in relief of the Freedmen. Her interest in her own sex began  early, and continued to the last.    At the age of twenty-two she married, and about the year 1842 removed  with her family to Ohio, where her home soon became the refuge of the  fugitive slave, and the resting-place of his defenders. In 1849 she  began, with her husband, Chas. S. S. Griffing, her public labors in  connection with the \"American\" and the \"Western Anti-Slavery  Societies,\" speaking at first to small audiences in school-houses, and  when prejudice and bitterness gave way, to conventions, and  mass-meetings; opposition and curiosity yielding finally to sympathy  and aid. But for years the meetings were often broken up by mobs. The  effort to uproot slavery was pronounced either absurd, treasonable, or  irreligious; that it would incite insurrection of the slaves; or if  successful, bring great responsibility upon the Abolitionists, and  disaster to the whole country.    In 1861, Mrs. Griffing, prompted by the same loyal spirit that moved  all the women of the nation, turned from the ordinary occupations of  life to see what she could do to mitigate the miseries of the war. She  united at once with \"The National Woman's Loyal League,\" lecturing and  organizing societies in the West for the soldiers and freedmen, to  whom large quantities of clothing and other supplies were sent, and  circulating petitions to Congress for the emancipation of slaves as a  war measure.    While thus engaged, her thoughts naturally turned to the large number  of Southern slaves coming with the army into Washington, whose future  she foresaw would be beset with distress and want during the long  period of change from chattelism to the settled habits of freedom.  They were coming by the hundreds and thousands in 1863, with a vague  idea of being cared for by \"the Governor,\" but the Government had as  yet made no provision, separate from that for the soldiers, when Mrs.  Griffing went to Washington and began her labors for them, which were  continued until her death.    She at once counseled with President Lincoln and Secretary Stanton as  to the best methods for immediate relief; proposed plans which they  approved, and received from them every aid possible in their  execution. Her first step was to open three ration-houses, where she  fed at least a thousand of the old and most destitute of the freed  people daily. She visited hundreds in the alleys and old stables, in  attics and cellars, and in almost every place where shelter could be  found, and became acquainted personally with their necessities, and  the best means of supplying them. There were 30,000 in the capital at  this time, and it would be difficult to give an idea to one not there,  of the time and labor it cost to hunt out the old barracks and get  them transformed into shelters for these outcasts. Upon the personal  order of the Secretary of War, she was allowed army blankets and wood,  which she distributed herself, going with the army wagons to see that  those suffering most were first supplied. This \"temporary relief\" was  necessarily continued for some time, during which Mrs. Griffing was  made the General Agent of \"The National Freedman's Relief Association  of the District of Columbia.\" She opened a correspondence with the Aid  societies of the Northern and New England States, which resulted in  her receiving supplies of clothing and provisions, which were most  acceptable. These were carefully dispensed by herself and two  daughters, who were her assistants. Mrs. Griffing opened three  industrial schools, where the women were taught to sew;[26] a price  was set on their labors, and they were paid in ready-made garments.  The Secretary aided in the purchase of suitable cloth, and with that  sent from the North, such outfits were supplied as could be afforded.    It was soon apparent to Mrs. Griffing that the Government must provide  for the old and the infirm, and that until labor could be found, even  a majority of the strong must be included in the provision--with the  understanding, however, that they must seek employment and exert  themselves to find homes--and that educational and political interests  must be established and encouraged. The stress of the situation can  not be said ever to have relaxed during our friend's life, except as  to numbers--at any rate in the early years; but as soon as some system  grew out of the confusion, and all that could be, were supplied with  bread and shelter, she turned her attention in part to the larger  plan, and urged a bureau under Government; a department for these  freedmen's interests. This plan was favored by Messrs. Sumner, Wade,  Wilson, and a few other Senators and Members of Congress, and in  December, 1863, a bill for a Bureau of Emancipation was introduced in  the House of Representatives by Hon. Mr. Elliot, of Massachusetts. It  received no welcome; few cared to listen to the details of the  necessity, and it was only through Mrs. Griffing's brave and unwearied  efforts that the plan was accepted, and carried through in March,  1865, under the title of \"The Freedman's Bureau.\" The writer has had  testimony to the truth of this from Senators Wade of Ohio, Howard of  Michigan, and others, as well as to the fact that a majority of the  Congressional Committee in charge of the bill, wished that Mrs.  Griffing should be made Commissioner (among whom, and most active in  support of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#8)"],[1,"d; his eyes shone: he struggled       for utterance, and gasped, 'Is it not true, Hummel, that I       have some talent, after all?'         \"These were his last words. His eyes grew fixed, his mouth       fell open, and his spirit passed away.         \"They buried him in the little cemetery of Dobling.\"    Among the most eminent composers of the present century may be  mentioned Auber, Schubert, Rossini, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, Weber,  Verdi, and Wagner.    In \"The Contemporary Review\" there lately appeared the following  beautifully worded tribute to the noble qualities of Mendelssohn:--         \"Mendelssohn reigns forever in a sweet wayside temple of his       own, full of bright dreams and visions, incense, and ringing       songs, and partly is he so sweet, because, unburthened with       any sense of a message to utter, a mission to develop, he       sings like a child in the valleys of asphodel, weaving       bright chaplets of spring flowers for the whole world,       looking upon the mystery of grief and pain with wide eyes of       sympathy, and at last succumbing to it himself, but not       understanding it, with a song of tender surprise upon his       lips.\"    Since the times of the great writers of the eighteenth century, and of  the first half of the present one, no new developments or advancements  have been made in musical creations.[7] Indeed, it would seem that the  time has not yet come for attempts to be made to improve upon the  works of those great musical luminaries; for they have left too much  that is deep, classical, charmingly beautiful, and soul-satisfying.  The musical world has paused, not caring to go farther, to  conscientiously study their noble creations, so fruitful in the  delights, the soul-elevating influences, which they afford.    [Footnote 7: It would, perhaps, be better at present to except those  of Wagner, upon the _surpassing_ merits of which the best critics are  as yet divided.]    But, although no great genius has of late years appeared with newer  and greater creations to claim our attention from those of the past,  it is gratifying to know that great advancement is being made in a  more general musical culture among the people; while the number of  really great instrumentalists and vocalists is quite large, and is  constantly increasing. In these latter respects the present far  exceeds the past.[8] In fact, the study of the art of music has begun  to be considered a necessity; and ability in its comprehension and  performance is now far from being considered as merely an ornamental  accomplishment. All this springs from the very nature of this divine  art, the mission, so to speak, of which is, to constantly open new  fountains of pleasure in the human heart; to cheer, to soothe, and to  bless mankind throughout all time.    [Footnote 8: It should also be here remarked, that there has been,  too, a remarkable improvement made in the construction of most all  musical instruments; they having been brought to a nicety and beauty  of form and tone probably not dreamed of by the makers of the past.]    But, after all, we know not how soon another great musical genius may  startle us from our complacent studies of the masters of the past; for  we are even now somewhat threatened in this respect by Richard Wagner,  the eminent composer of Germany. He is not satisfied with the music of  the past nor the present, and points to his own present and  prospective creations as samples of what the \"music of the future\"  will be. Just now, musical critics, while generally conceding to him  much power as a composer, are divided in opinion as to whether his  ideas are to be accepted in their entirety.    Still, who can now tell what the \"music of the future\" _may_ be?    Before closing this chapter on the history of music, I think it highly  proper, as a matter of record and of appropriate interest, to refer  briefly to the almost wonderful achievements of that brilliant  impressario, P.S. Gilmore of Boston, who in the year 1869 conceived  the idea of having a grand musical festival, the noble objects of  which were to celebrate the restoration of peace in the United States,  and to quicken and increase the interest felt in music throughout this  country, and also the world, by bringing together in a single  performance a larger body of most skilful musicians than was ever  before attempted. An immense building called \"The Coliseum\" was  constructed for the purposes of the festival, which was to continue  five days. On the 15th of June, in the city of Boston, \"The National  Jubilee and Great Musical Festival\" was begun. The number of  instruments and performers composing the great orchestra was 1,011;  and an organ of immense proportions and power, built expressly for the  occasion, was employed. The grand chorus and solo vocalists numbered  1,040. Besides, one hundred anvils (used in the rendering of Verdi's  \"Anvil Chorus\") were played upon by a hundred of the city's firemen in  full uniform; while to all this was added a group of cannon, the same  being used in the performance of the \"Star-spangled Banner.\" The vast  chorus, the orchestra, and all the leading performers (among the  latter were Ole Bull, Parepa, and Carl Rosa), were selected from the  finest musical people of the country, being accepted only after strict  testing by skilful judges. At this great gathering many of the works  of the great composers were performed, and only works of real merit  had a place on the programme. These were all performed by this vast  _ensemble_ with a precision and an excellence that were really grand  and wonderful. This achievement of Gilmore was considered the most  brilliant entertainment of modern times. Of it, it has been truly  said,--         \"This great event, by the sublimity of its music, held the       nation spell-bound. The great volume of song swept through       the land like a flood of melody, filling every Christian       heart with 'glad tidings of great joy.' It came like a       sunburst upon a musical world, shedding light where had been       darkness before, and revealing a new sphere of harmony, a       fairy-land of promise, and triumphantly realizing greater       achievements in the divine art than were hitherto thought       possible. It will ever be a memorable epoch in the history       of music, a glorious event; and thousands upon thousands are       happier for that week of glorious music. The boom of the       cannon, the stroke of the bells,[9] the clang of the anvils,       the peal of the organ, the harmony of the thousand       instruments, the melody of the thousands of voices, the       inspiring works of the great masters, the song of the       'Star-spangled Banner,' the cheers of the multitude, the       splendor of the spectacle,--the memory of all this is the       rich possession of many, and will be ever recalled as the       happiest experiences of a lifetime.\"    [Footnote 9: The church-bells of the city were also employed in  rendering some of the music.]    The success of the \"National Peace Jubilee\" was so perfect, and had  produced a musical enthusiasm and revival so great, that, in the year  1872, Gilmore, still prolific in startling musical conceptions,  projected and carried into execution another festival of the same  general character as the first, only that it was far vaster and more  daring in its proportions. This one he styled \"The World's Peace  Jubilee and International Festival.\" Several times during the week  that this great musical festival was held, not less than fifty  thousand people were present in the immense Coliseum building. This  time the orchestra consisted of two thousand instruments, and the  chorus numbered over seventeen hundred voices; while a mighty organ  and cannon and anvils were used as before. The great soloists engaged  were Mme. Leutner, Johann Strauss, Franz Abt, and Bendel. Foreign  governments being invited to send representatives from among their  best musicians, England sent the Band of the Grenadier Guards;  Germany, its great Prussian Band; France, the brilliant French  Republic Band. King William of Prussia sent also, as a special  compliment, his classical Court Cornet Quartet; and Ireland sent its  best band. To this galaxy of star military bands, perhaps the greatest  ever assembled, the United States added its own favorite Marine Band  of Washington. At this second great and vast assemblage of artists the  almost marvellous achievements of the first \"Jubilee\" were repeated to  the utmost delight of many thousands of people, and Gilmore became at  once the most brilliant and daring impressario genius of the world.    As before intimated, Wagner is not at all satisfied with pausing where  Mozart, Beethoven, and other great composers, left off. He believes  that their music can be improved upon. According to his theory, the  music of the opera, in the most highly-developed form of the latter,  is but an incidental element, the dramatic part being principal. He  lately composed a triology--three operas connected as one--with a  prologue, the subjects of the dramas being taken from mythology, and  forming beautiful fairy tales. To carry to the greatest perfection his  views and firmly-held ideas as to what music should be, and as to what  he stoutly avers it will be in the future, he selected from far and  near only the best artists for the performance of his opera (these  were subjected to long and careful rehearsals under his own  conductorship), and erected at Bayreuth, in Bavaria, a large and  beautiful theatre, which, in its minutest details even, was built  under his own supervision, and after his own peculiar ideas. It being  calculated to show to the highest advantage his conception, that, in  the expression of sentiment, music is only secondary, his orchestra of  one hundred and ten performers was placed out of sight of the audience  during the acting of the opera.
