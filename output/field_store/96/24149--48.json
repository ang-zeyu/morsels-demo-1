As early as the 16th century there was a belief in  a <i>Terra australis</i> (to which was often added the epithet  <i>incognita</i>), literally \"southern land,\" which was  believed to be land lying round and stretching outwards from  the South Pole.    In `Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of  Australasia,' Sydney, Jan. 1892, is printed a paper read at the  Geographical Congress at Berne, by E. Delmar Morgan, on the  `Early Discovery of Australia.'  This paper is illustrated by  maps taken from `Nordenskiold's Atlas.'  In a map by Orontius  Finoeus, a French cosmographer of Provence, dated 1531, the  <i>Terra australis</i> is shown as \"Terra Australis recenter  inventa, sed nondum plene cognita.\"  In Ortelius' Map, 1570, it  appears as \"Terra Australis nondum cognita.\"  In Gerard  Mercator's Map, 1587, as \"Terra Australis\" simply.    In 1606 the Spaniard Fernandez de Quiros gave the name of  <i>Terra Australis del Espiritu Santo</i> to land which he  thought formed part of the Great Southland.  It is in fact one  of the New Hebrides.    The word \"<i>Australian</i> \" is older than \"<i>Australia</i>\"  (see quotations, 1693 and 1766).  The name <i>Australia</i> was  adapted from the Latin name <i>Terra Australis</i>.  The  earliest suggestion of the word is credited to Flinders, who  certainly thought that he was inventing the name.  (See  quotation, 1814.)  Twenty-one years earlier, however, the word  is found (see quotation, 1793); and the passage containing it  is the first known use of the word in print.  Shaw may thus be  regarded as its inventor.  According to its title-page, the  book quoted is by two authors, the <i>Zoology</i>, by Shaw and  the <i>Botany</i> by Smith.  The <i>Botany</i>, however, was  not published.  Of the two names--<i>Australia</i> and  <i>Australasia</i>--suggested in the opening of the quotation,  to take the place of New Holland, Shaw evidently favoured  <i>Australia</i>, while Smith, in the `Transactions of the  Linnaean Society,' vol. iv. p. 213 (1798), uses  <i>Australasia</i> for the continent several times.  Neither  name, however, passed then into general use.  In 1814, Robert  Brown the Botanist speaks of \"<i>Terra Australis</i>,\" not of  \"<i>Australia</i>.\" \"Australia\" was reinvented by Flinders.    <i>Quotations for \" Terra Australis\"</i>--    1621.

Burton, `Anatomy of Melancholy' (edition 1854), p. 56:    \"For the site, if you will needs urge me to it, I am not fully  resolved, it may be in <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>, there  is room enough (for of my knowledge, neither that hungry  Spaniard nor Mercurius Britannicus have yet discovered half of  it).\"    Ibid. p. 314:    \"<i>Terra Australis incognita</i>. ..and yet in likelihood it  may be so, for without all question, it being extended from the  tropic of Capricorn to the circle Antarctic, and lying as it  doth in the temperate zone, cannot choose but yield in time  some flourishing kingdoms to succeeding ages, as America did  unto the Spaniards.\"    Ibid. p. 619:    \"But these are hard-hearted, unnatural, monsters of men,  shallow politicians, they do not consider that a great part of  the world is not yet inhabited as it ought, how many colonies  into America, <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>, Africa may be  sent?\"    <i>Early quotations for \"Australian</i>\"    1693.  `Nouveau Voyage de la Terre Australe, contenant les  Coutumes et les Moeurs des Australiens, etc.'  Par Jaques  Sadeur [Gabriel de Foigny].

He also  gave the citizens the county of Middlesex to farm on payment to the  Crown of 300_l._ a year--a payment still made: they were to appoint a  Sheriff for the county: and they were to have leave to hunt in the  forests of Middlesex, Surrey, and the Chiltern Hills. They were also  empowered to elect their own justiciar and allowed to try their own  cases within their own limits.    [Illustration: TOWER IN THE EARLIER STYLE. CHURCH AT EARL'S BARTON.    (_The battlements are much later._)]    This was a very important Charter. No doubt, like the first, it was  stipulated as a price for the support of the City. William Rufus was  killed on Thursday--Henry was in London on Saturday. He must therefore  have ridden hard to get over the hundred and twenty miles of rough  bridle track between the New Forest and London. But the City supported  him and this was their reward.    We are gradually approaching the modern constitution of the City. The  Portreeve or first Magistrate, in the year 1189, in the person of Henry  Fitz Aylwin, assumed the title of Mayor--not Lord Mayor: the title came  later, a habit or style, never a rank conferred. With him were two  Sheriffs, the Sheriff of the City and the Sheriff of the County. There  was the Bishop: there was the City Justiciar with his courts. There were  also the Aldermen, not yet an elected body.    The Londoners elected Stephen King, and stood by him through all the  troubles that followed. The plainest proof of the strength and  importance of the City is shown in the fact that when Matilda took  revenge on London by depriving the City of its Charters the citizens  rose and drove her out of London and made her cause hopeless.          13. FITZSTEPHEN'S ACCOUNT OF THE CITY.    PART I.      The White Tower is the only building in modern London which belongs to  Norman London. Portions remain--fragments--a part of the church of St.  Bartholomew the Great, a part of the church of St. Ethelburga, the crypt  of Bow Church: very little else. All the rest has been destroyed by  time, by 'improvements,' or by fire, the greatest enemy to cities in  every country and every age. Thus, three great fires in the tenth and  eleventh century swept London from end to end. No need to ask if  anything remains of the Roman or the Saxon City. Not a vestige is  left--except the little fragment, known as the London Stone, now lying  behind iron bars in the wall of St. Swithin's Church. Churches, Palaces,  Monasteries, Castles--all perished in those three fires. The City, no  doubt, speedily sprang again from its ashes, but of its rebuilding on  each occasion we have no details at all.    Most fortunately, there exists a document priceless and unique, short as  it is and meagre in many of its details, which describes London as it  was in the reign of Henry II. It is written by one FitzStephen, Chaplain  to Thomas Becket. He was present at the murder of the Archbishop and  wrote his life, to which this account is an introduction.    [Illustration: A NORMAN SHIP.    (_From the Bayeux Tapestry._)]    He says, first of all, that the City contained thirteen larger  conventual churches and a hundred and twenty-six parish churches. He  writes only fifty years after the Great Fire, so that it is not likely  that new parishes had been erected. All the churches which had been  destroyed were rebuilt. Most of them were very small parishes, with,  doubtless, very small churches. We shall return presently to the  question of the churches.    [Illustration: BUILDING A CHURCH IN THE LATER STYLE.    (_From a drawing belonging to the Society of Antiquaries._)]    On the east was the White Tower which he calls the 'Palatine Castle:'  on the west there were two towers--there was the Tower called  Montfichet, where is now Blackfriars station, and Baynard's Castle,  close beside it. The walls of the City had seven double gates. The river  wall had by this time been taken down. Two miles from the City, on the  west, was the Royal Palace (Westminster), fortified with ramparts and  connected with the City by a populous suburb. Already, therefore, the  Strand and Charing Cross were settled. The gates were Aldgate,  Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate, Ludgate, and the Bridge.    FitzStephen says that the citizens were so powerful that they could  furnish the King with 20,000 horsemen and 60,000 foot. This is clearly  gross exaggeration. If we allow 500 for each parish, we get a population  of only 63,000 in all, and in the enumeration later on, for the poll tax  by Richard the Second, there were no more than 48,000. This, however,  was shortly after a great Plague had ravaged the City.    But the writer tells us that the citizens excelled those of any other  city in the world in 'handsomeness of manners and of dress, at table,  and in way of speaking.' There were three principal schools, the  scholars of which rivalled each other, and engaged in public contests of  rhetoric and grammar.    Those who worked at trades and sold wares of any kind were assigned  their proper place whither they repaired every morning. It is easy to  make out from the surviving names where the trades were placed. The  names of Bread Street, Fish Street, Milk Street, Honey Lane, Wood  Street, Soapers' Lane, the Poultry, for instance, indicate what trades  were carried on there. Friday Street shows that the food proper for fast  days was sold there--namely, dried fish. Cheapside preserves the name  of the Chepe, the most important of all the old streets. Here, every  day, all the year round, was a market held at which everything  conceivable was sold, not in shops, but in _selds_, that is, covered  wooden sheds, which could be taken down on occasion. Do not think that  'Chepe' was a narrow street: it was a great open space lying between St.  Paul's and what is now the Royal Exchange, with streets north and south  formed by rows of these _selds_ or sheds. Presently the sheds became  houses with shops in front and gardens behind. The roadway on the south  side of this open space was called the Side of Chepe. There was another  open space for salesmen called East Chepe, another at Billingsgate,  called Roome Lane, another at Dowgate--both for purposes of exposing for  sale imports landed on the Quays and the ports of Queenhithe and  Billingsgate. Those who have seen a market-place in a French town will  understand what these places were like. A large irregular area. On every  side sheds with wares for sale: at first all seems confusion and noise:  presently one makes out that there are streets in orderly array, in  which those who know can find what they want. Here are mercers; here  goldsmiths; here armourers; here glovers; here pepperers or grocers; and  so forth. West Chepe is the place of shops where they sell the things  made in the City and all things wanted for the daily life.    On the other side of the Walbrook, across which there is a bridge where  is now the Poultry, is East Chepe, whither they bring all kinds of  imported goods and sell them to the retailers: and by the river side the  merchants assemble in the open places beside Queenhithe and Billingsgate  to receive or to buy the cargoes sent over from France, Spain, and the  Low Countries. One more open space there was, that round St. Paul's,  the place where the people held their folkmotes. But London was not, as  yet, by any means built over. Its northern parts were covered with  gardens. It was here, as we shall see, that the great monasteries were  shortly to be built.    [Illustration: LAY COSTUMES IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY.]            14. FITZSTEPHEN'S ACCOUNT OF THE CITY.    PART II.      Outside the walls, he says, there were many places of pleasant resort,  streams and springs among them. He means the Fleet River winding at the  bottom of its broad valley: farther west Tyburn and Westbourne: on the  south the Wandle, the Effra, the Ravensbourne. There was a well at  Holywell in the Strand--it lies under the site of the present Opera  Comique Theatre: and at Clerkenwell: these wells had medicinal or  miraculous properties and there were, no doubt, taverns and places of  amusement about there. At Smithfield--or Smooth Field--just outside the  City walls, there was held once a week--on Friday--a horse fair.  Business over, horse racing followed. Then the river was full of fish:  some went fishing for their livelihood: some for amusement: salmon were  plentiful and great fish such as porpoises sometimes found their way  above Bridge.    Then there were the sports of the young men and the boys. They played at  ball--when have not young men played at ball? The young Londoners  practised some form of hockey out of which have grown the two noble  games of cricket and golf. They wrestled and leaped. Nothing is said  about boxing and quarterstaff. But perhaps these belonged to the  practice of arms and archery, which were never neglected, because at any  moment the London craftsman might have to become a soldier. They had  cock fighting, a sport to which the Londoner was always greatly  addicted. And they loved dancing with the girls to the music of pipe and  tabor. In the winter, when the broad fens north of the walls were  frozen, they skated. And they hunted with hawk and hound in the Forest  of Middlesex, which belonged to the City.    [Illustration: COSTUME OF SHEPHERDS IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY.]    The City, he tells us, is governed by the same laws as those of Rome.  Like Rome, London is divided into wards: like Rome the City has annually  elected magistrates who are called Sheriffs instead of Consuls: like  Rome it has senatorial and inferior magistrates: like Rome it has  separate Courts and proper places for law suits, and like Rome the City  holds assemblies on ordered days. The writer is carried away by his  enthusiasm for Rome. As"]]]
