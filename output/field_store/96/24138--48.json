Then, when she heard this verdict, which had to be repeated to her, and  which her bright and lively complexion and brilliant eyes seemed to  contradict, the marquise turned all her thoughts towards holy things,  and thought only of dying like a saint after having already suffered  like a martyr. She consequently asked to receive the last sacrament, and  while it was being sent for, she repeated her apologies to her husband  and her forgiveness of his brothers, and this with a gentleness that,  joined to her beauty, made her whole personality appear angelic. When,  however, the priest bearing the viaticum entered, this expression  suddenly changed, and her face presented every token of the greatest  terror. She had just recognised in the priest who was bringing her the  last consolations of Heaven the infamous Perette, whom she could not but  regard as an accomplice of the abbe and the chevalier, since, after  having tried to hold her back, he had attempted to crush her beneath the  pitcher of water which he had thrown at her from the window, and since,  when he saw her escaping, he had run to warn her assassins and to set  them on her track. She recovered herself quickly, however, and seeing  that the priest, without any sign of remorse, was drawing near to her  bedside, she would not cause so great a scandal as would have been  caused by denouncing him at such a moment. Nevertheless, bending towards  him, she said, \"Father, I hope that, remembering what has passed, and in  order to dispel fears that--I may justifiably entertain, you will make  no difficulty of partaking with me of the consecrated wafer; for I have  sometimes heard it said that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, while  remaining a token of salvation, has been known to be made a principle of  death.\"    The priest inclined his head as a sign of assent.    So the marquise communicated thus, taking a sacrament that she shared  with one of her murderers, as an evidence that she forgave this one like  the others and that she prayed God to forgive them as she herself did.    The following days passed without any apparent increase in her illness,  the fever by which she was consumed rather enhancing her beauties, and  imparting to her voice and gestures a vivacity which they had never had  before. Thus everybody had begun to recover hope, except herself, who,  feeling better than anyone else what was her true condition, never for a  moment allowed herself any illusion, and keeping her son, who was seven  years old, constantly beside her bed, bade him again and again look well  at her, so that, young as he was, he might remember her all his life and  never forget her in his prayers. The poor child would burst into tears  and promise not only to remember her but also to avenge her when he was  a man. At these words the marquise gently reproved him, telling him that  all vengeance belonged to the king and to God, and that all cares of the  kind must be left to those two great rulers of heaven and of earth.    On the 3rd of June, M. Catalan, a councillor, appointed as a  commissioner by the Parliament of Toulouse, arrived at Ganges, together  with all the officials required by his commission; but he could not see  the marquise that night, for she had dozed for some hours, and this  sleep had left a sort of torpor upon her mind, which might have impaired  the lucidity of her depositions. The next morning, without asking  anybody's opinion, M. Catalan repaired to the house of M. Desprats, and  in spite of some slight resistance on the part of those who were in  charge of her, made his way to the presence of the marquise. The dying  woman received him with an admirable presence of mind, that made M.  Catalan think there had been an intention the night before to prevent  any meeting between him and the person whom he was sent to interrogate.  At first the marquise would relate nothing that had passed, saying that  she could not at the same time accuse and forgive; but M. Catalan  brought her to see that justice required truth from her before all  things, since, in default of exact information, the law might go astray,  and strike the innocent instead of the guilty. This last argument  decided the marquise, and during the hour and a half that he spent alone  with her she told him all the details of this horrible occurrence. On  the morrow M. Catalan was to see her again; but on the morrow the  marquise was, in truth, much worse. He assured himself of this by his  own eyes, and as he knew almost all that he wished to know, did not  insist further, for fear of fatiguing her.    Indeed, from that day forward, such atrocious sufferings laid hold upon  the marquise, that notwithstanding the firmness which she had always  shown, and which she tried to maintain to the end, she could not prevent  herself from uttering screams mingled with prayers. In this manner she  spent the whole day of the 4th and part of the 5th. At last, on that  day, which was a Sunday, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, she  expired.    The body was immediately opened, and the physicians attested that the  marquise had died solely from the power of the poison, none of the seven  sword cuts which she had received being, mortal. They found the stomach  and bowels burned and the brain blackened. However, in spite of that  infernal draught, which, says the official report, \"would have killed a  lioness in a few hours,\" the marquise struggled for nineteen days, so  much, adds an account from which we have borrowed some of these details,  so much did nature lovingly defend the beautiful body that she had taken  so much trouble to make.      M. Catalan, the very moment he was informed of the marquise's death,       having with him twelve guards belonging to the governor, ten       archers, and a poqueton,--despatched them to the marquis's castle       with orders to seize his person, that of the priest, and those of       all the servants except the groom who had assisted the marquise in       her flight. The officer in command of this little squad found the       marquis walking up and down, melancholy and greatly disturbed, in       the large hall of the castle, and when he signified to him the       order of which he was the bearer, the marquis, without making any       resistance, and as though prepared for what was happening to him,       replied that he was ready to obey, and that moreover he had always       intended to go before the Parliament to accuse the murderers of his       wife. He was asked for the key of his cabinet, which he gave up,       and the order was given to conduct him, with the other persons       accused, to the prisons of Montpellier. As soon as the marquis came       into that town, the report of his arrival spread with incredible       rapidity from street to street. Then, as it was dark, lights came       to all the windows, and people corning out with torches formed a       torchlight procession, by means of which everybody could see him.       He, like the priest, was mounted on a sorry hired horse, and       entirely surrounded by archers, to whom, no doubt, he owed his life       on this occasion; for the indignation against him was so great that       everyone was egging on his neighbours to tear him limb from limb,       which would certainly have come to pass had he not been so       carefully defended and guarded.    Immediately upon receiving news of her daughter's death, Madame de  Rossan took possession of all her property, and, making herself a party  to the case, declared that she would never desist from her suit until  her daughter's death was avenged. M. Catalan began the examination at  once, and the first interrogation to which he submitted the marquis  lasted eleven hours. Then soon afterwards he and the other persons  accused were conveyed from the prisons of Montpellier to those of  Toulouse. A crushing memorial by Madame de Rossan followed them, in  which she demonstrated with absolute clearness that the marquis had  participated in the crime of his two brothers, if not in act, in  thought, desire, and intention.    The marquis's defence was very simple: it was his misfortune to have had  two villains for brothers, who had made attempts first upon the honour  and then upon the life of a wife whom he loved tenderly; they had  destroyed her by a most atrocious death, and to crown his evil fortune,  he, the innocent, was accused of having had a hand in that death. And,  indeed, the examinations in the trial did not succeed in bringing any  evidence against the marquis beyond moral presumptions, which, it  appears, were insufficient to induce his judges to award a sentence of  death.    A verdict was consequently given, upon the 21st of August, 1667, which  sentenced the abbe and the chevalier de Ganges to be broken alive on the  wheel, the Marquis de Ganges to perpetual banishment from the kingdom,  his property to be confiscated to the king, and himself to lose his  nobility and to become incapable of succeeding to the property of his  children. As for the priest Perette, he was sentenced to the galleys for  life, after having previously been degraded from his clerical orders by  the ecclesiastical authorities.    This sentence made as great a stir as the murder had done, and gave  rise, in that period when \"extenuating circumstances\" had not been  invented, to long and angry discussions. Indeed, the marquis either was  guilty of complicity or was not: if he was not, the punishment was too  cruel; if he was, the sentence was too light. Such was the opinion of  Louis XIV., who remembered the beauty of the Marquis de Ganges; for,  some time afterwards, when he was believed to have forgotten this  unhappy affair, and when he was asked to pardon the Marquis de la Douze,  who was accused of having poisoned his wife, the king answered, \"There  is no need for a pardon, since he belongs to the Parliament of Toulouse,  and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#8)"],[1,"rather the  nation whom you will render happy, the posterity whose name you will  make glorious. Yes; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than  life, I shall have given you immortality.\"    The prince offered his hand to Aramis, who sank upon his knee and kissed  it.    \"It is the first act of homage paid to our future king,\" said he. \"When  I see you again, I shall say, 'Good day, sire.'\"    \"Till then,\" said the young man, pressing his wan and wasted fingers  over his heart,--\"till then, no more dreams, no more strain on my  life--my heart would break! Oh, monsieur, how small is my prison--how  low the window--how narrow are the doors! To think that so much pride,  splendor, and happiness, should be able to enter in and to remain here!\"    \"Your royal highness makes me proud,\" said Aramis, \"since you infer it  is I who brought all this.\" And he rapped immediately on the door.  The jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux, who, devoured by fear and  uneasiness, was beginning, in spite of himself, to listen at the door.  Happily, neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice,  even in the most passionate outbreaks.    \"What a confessor!\" said the governor, forcing a laugh; \"who would  believe that a compulsory recluse, a man as though in the very jaws of  death, could have committed crimes so numerous, and so long to tell of?\"    Aramis made no reply. He was eager to leave the Bastile, where the  secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls.  As soon as they reached Baisemeaux's quarters, \"Let us proceed to  business, my dear governor,\" said Aramis.    \"Alas!\" replied Baisemeaux.    \"You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand  livres,\" said the bishop.    \"And to pay over the first third of the sum,\" added the poor governor,  with a sigh, taking three steps towards his iron strong-box.    \"Here is the receipt,\" said Aramis.    \"And here is the money,\" returned Baisemeaux, with a threefold sigh.    \"The order instructed me only to give a receipt; it said nothing about  receiving the money,\" rejoined Aramis. \"Adieu, monsieur le governeur!\"    And he departed, leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with  joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the  confessor extraordinary to the Bastile.        Chapter II. How Mouston Had Become Fatter without Giving Porthos Notice  Thereof, and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy  Gentleman.    Since the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D'Artagnan were  seldom together. One was occupied with harassing duties for the king,  the other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended  to forward to his estate, and by aid of which he hoped to establish in  his various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed  in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty's society. D'Artagnan,  ever faithful, one morning during an interval of service thought about  Porthos, and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a  fortnight, directed his steps towards his hotel, and pounced upon him  just as he was getting up. The worthy baron had a pensive--nay,  more than pensive--melancholy air. He was sitting on his bed, only  half-dressed, and with legs dangling over the edge, contemplating a host  of garments, which with their fringes, lace, embroidery, and slashes  of ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over the floor. Porthos, sad and  reflective as La Fontaine's hare, did not observe D'Artagnan's entrance,  which was, moreover, screened at this moment by M. Mouston, whose  personal corpulency, quite enough at any time to hide one man from  another, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant  was holding up for his master's inspection, by the sleeves, that he  might the better see it all over. D'Artagnan stopped at the threshold  and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then, as the sight of the  innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the  bosom of that excellent gentleman, D'Artagnan thought it time to put  an end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of announcing  himself.    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; \"ah! ah!  Here is D'Artagnan. I shall then get hold of an idea!\"    At these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out  of the way, smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus  found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented  his reaching D'Artagnan. Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in  rising, and crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face  with his friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection  that seemed to increase with every day. \"Ah!\" he repeated, \"you are  always welcome, dear friend; but just now you are more welcome than  ever.\"    \"But you seem to have the megrims here!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.    Porthos replied by a look expressive of dejection. \"Well, then, tell me  all about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is a secret.\"    \"In the first place,\" returned Porthos, \"you know I have no secrets from  you. This, then, is what saddens me.\"    \"Wait a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of  satin and velvet!\"    \"Oh, never mind,\" said Porthos, contemptuously; \"it is all trash.\"    \"Trash, Porthos! Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell! gorgeous satin!  regal velvet!\"    \"Then you think these clothes are--\"    \"Splendid, Porthos, splendid! I'll wager that you alone in France have  so many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were to live to  be a hundred years of age, which wouldn't astonish me in the very least,  you could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being  obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.\"    Porthos shook his head.    \"Come, my friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this unnatural melancholy in you  frightens me. My dear Porthos, pray get it out, then. And the sooner the  better.\"    \"Yes, my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.\"    \"Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux?\"    \"No: they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the  estimate.\"    \"Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?\"    \"No, my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock  all the pools in the neighborhood.\"    \"Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?\"    \"No, my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning  a hundred paces from the chateau, and a fountain sprung up in a place  entirely destitute of water.\"    \"What in the world _is_ the matter, then?\"    \"The fact is, I have received an invitation for the _fete_ at Vaux,\"  said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.    \"Well! do you complain of that? The king has caused a hundred mortal  heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations. And so, my  dear friend, you are really going to Vaux?\"    \"Indeed I am!\"    \"You will see a magnificent sight.\"    \"Alas! I doubt it, though.\"    \"Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there!\"    \"Ah!\" cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.    \"Eh! good heavens, are you ill?\" cried D'Artagnan.    \"I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf! It isn't that.\"    \"But what is it, then?\"    \"'Tis that I have no clothes!\"    D'Artagnan stood petrified. \"No clothes! Porthos, no clothes!\" he cried,  \"when I see at least fifty suits on the floor.\"    \"Fifty, truly; but not one which fits me!\"    \"What? not one that fits you? But are you not measured, then, when you  give an order?\"    \"To be sure he is,\" answered Mouston; \"but unfortunately _I_ have gotten  stouter!\"    \"What! _you_ stouter!\"    \"So much so that I am now bigger than the baron. Would you believe it,  monsieur?\"    \"_Parbleu!_ it seems to me that is quite evident.\"    \"Do you see, stupid?\" said Porthos, \"that is quite evident!\"    \"Be still, my dear Porthos,\" resumed D'Artagnan, becoming slightly  impatient, \"I don't understand why your clothes should not fit you,  because Mouston has grown stouter.\"    \"I am going to explain it,\" said Porthos. \"You remember having related  to me the story of the Roman general Antony, who had always seven wild  boars kept roasting, each cooked up to a different point; so that he  might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask  for it. Well, then, I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to  court to spend a week, I resolved to have always seven suits ready for  the occasion.\"    \"Capitally reasoned, Porthos--only a man must have a fortune like yours  to gratify such whims. Without counting the time lost in being measured,  the fashions are always changing.\"    \"That is exactly the point,\" said Porthos, \"in regard to which I  flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device.\"    \"Tell me what it is; for I don't doubt your genius.\"    \"You remember what Mouston once was, then?\"    \"Yes; when he used to call himself Mousqueton.\"    \"And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?\"    \"No, not exactly. I beg your pardon, my good Mouston.\"    \"Oh! you are not in fault, monsieur,\" said Mouston, graciously. \"You  were in Paris, and as for us, we were at Pierrefonds.\"    \"Well, well, my dear Porthos; there was a time when Mouston began to  grow fat. Is that what you wished to say?\"    \"Yes, my friend; and I greatly rejoice over the period.\"    \"Indeed, I believe you do,\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.    \"You understand,\" continued Porthos, \"what a world of trouble it spared  for me.\"    \"No, I don't--by any means.\"    \"Look here, my friend. In the first place, as you have said, to be  measured is a loss of time, even though it occur only once a fortnight.  And then, one may be travelling; and then you wish to have seven suits  always with you. In short, I have a horror of letting any one take my  measure. Confound it! either one "]]]
