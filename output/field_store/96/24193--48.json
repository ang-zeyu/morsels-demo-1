We teach the children to name all the forms of the plane insets.    At first I had intended to limit my teaching to the most important  names, such as square, rectangle, circle. But the children wanted to  know all the names, taking pleasure in learning even the most  difficult, such as trapezium, and decagon. They also show great  pleasure in listening to the exact pronunciation of new words and in  their repetition. Early childhood is, in fact, the age in which  language is formed, and in which the sounds of a foreign language can  be perfectly learned.    When the child has had long practise with the plane insets, he begins  to make \"discoveries\" in his environment, recognizing forms, colors,  and qualities already known to him--a result which, in general,  follows after all the sensory exercises. Then it is that a great  enthusiasm is aroused in him, and the world becomes for him a source  of pleasure. A little boy, walking one day alone on the roof terrace,  repeated to himself with a thoughtful expression on his face, \"The sky  is blue! the sky is blue!\" Once a cardinal, an admirer of the children  of the school in Via Guisti, wished himself to bring them some  biscuits and to enjoy the sight of a little greediness among the  children. When he had finished his distribution, instead of seeing the  children put the food hastily into their mouths, to his great surprise  he heard them call out, \"A triangle! a circle! a rectangle!\" In fact,  these biscuits were made in geometrical shapes.    In one of the people's dwellings at Milan, a mother, preparing the  dinner in the kitchen, took from a packet a slice of bread and butter.  Her little four-year-old boy who was with her said, \"Rectangle.\" The  woman going on with her work cut off a large corner of the slice of  bread, and the child cried out, \"Triangle.\" She put this bit into the  saucepan, and the child, looking at the piece that was left, called  out more loudly than before, \"And now it is a trapezium.\"    The father, a working man, who was present, was much impressed with  the incident. He went straight to look for the teacher and asked for  an explanation. Much moved, he said, \"If I had been educated in that  way I should not be now just an ordinary workman.\"    It was he who later on arranged for a demonstration to induce all the  workmen of the dwellings to take an interest in the school. They ended  by presenting the teacher with a parchment they had painted  themselves, and on it, between the pictures of little children, they  had introduced every kind of geometrical form.    As regards the touching of objects for the realization of their form,  there is an infinite field of discovery open to the child in his  environment. Children have been seen to stand opposite a beautiful  pillar or a statue and, after having admired it, to close their eyes  in a state of beatitude and pass their hands many times over the  forms. One of our teachers met one day in a church two little brothers  from the school in Via Guisti. They were standing looking at the small  columns supporting the altar. Little by little the elder boy edged  nearer the columns and began to touch them, then, as if he desired his  little brother to share his pleasure, he drew him nearer and, taking  his hand very gently, made him pass it round the smooth and beautiful  shape of the column. But a sacristan came up at that moment and sent  away \"those tiresome children who were touching everything.\"    The great pleasure which the children derive from the recognition of  _objects_ by touching their form corresponds in itself to a sensory  exercise.    Many psychologists have spoken of the _stereognostic_ sense, that is,  the capacity of recognizing forms by the movement of the muscles of  the hand as it follows the outlines of solid objects. This sense does  not consist only of the sense of touch, because the tactile sensation  is only that by which we perceive the differences in quality of  surfaces, rough or smooth. Perception of form comes from the  combination of two sensations, tactile and muscular, muscular  sensations being sensations of movement. What we call in the blind the  _tactile_ sense is in reality more often the stereognostic sense. That  is, they perceive by means of their hands the _form of bodies_.    It is the special muscular sensibility of the child from three to six  years of age who is forming his own muscular activity which stimulates  him to use the stereognostic sense. When the child spontaneously  blindfolds his eyes in order to recognize various objects, such as the  plane and solid insets, he is exercising this sense.    There are many exercises which he can do to enable him to recognize  with closed eyes objects of well defined shapes, as, for example, the  little bricks and cubes of Froebel, marbles, coins, beans, peas, etc.  From a selection of different objects mixed together he can pick out  those that are alike, and arrange them in separate heaps.    In the didactic material there are also geometrical solids--pale blue  in color--a sphere, a prism, a pyramid, a cone, a cylinder. The most  attractive way of teaching a child to recognize these forms is for him  to touch them with closed eyes and guess their names, the latter  learned in a way which I will describe later. After an exercise of  this kind the child when his eyes are open observes the forms with a  much more lively interest. Another way of interesting him in the solid  geometrical forms is to make them _move_. The sphere rolls in every  direction; the cylinder rolls in one direction only; the cone rolls  round itself; the prism and the pyramid, however, stand still, but the  prism falls over more easily than the pyramid.                      *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--SOUND BOXES.]    Little more remains of the didactic material for the education of the  senses. There is, however, a series of six cardboard cylinders, either  closed entirely or with wooden covers. (Fig. 26.)    When these cases are shaken they produce sounds varying in intensity  from loud to almost imperceptible sounds, according to the nature of  the objects inside the cylinder.    There is a double act of these, and the exercise consists, first, in  the recognition of sounds of equal intensity, arranging the cylinders  in pairs. The next exercise consists in the comparison of one sound  with another; that is, the child arranges the six cylinders in a  series according to the loudness of sound which they produce. The  exercise is analogous to that with the color spools, which also are  paired and then arranged in gradation. In this case also the child  performs the exercise seated comfortably at a table. After a  preliminary explanation from the teacher he repeats the exercise by  himself, his eyes being blindfolded that he may better concentrate his  attention.    We may conclude with a general rule for the direction of the education  of the senses. The order of procedure should be:    (1) Recognition of _identities_ (the pairing of similar objects and  the insertion of solid forms into places which fit them).    (2) Recognition of _contrasts_ (the presentation of the extremes of a  series of objects).    (3) Discrimination between objects very _similar_ to one another.    To concentrate the attention of the child upon the sensory stimulus  which is acting upon him at a particular moment, it is well, as far as  possible, to _isolate_ the sense; for instance, to obtain silence in  the room for all the exercises and to blindfold the eyes for those  particular exercises which do not relate to the education of the sense  of sight.    The cinematograph pictures give a general idea of all the sense  exercises which the children can do with the material, and any one who  has been initiated into the theory on which these are based will be  able gradually to recognize them as they are seen practically carried  out.    It is very advisable for those who wish to guide the children in these  sensory exercises to begin themselves by working with the didactic  material. The experience will give them some idea of what the children  must feel, of the difficulties which they must overcome, etc., and, up  to a certain point, it will give them some conception of the interest  which these exercises can arouse in them. Whoever makes such  experiments himself will be most struck by the fact that, when  blindfolded, he finds that all the sensations of touch and hearing  really appear more acute and more easily recognized. On account of  this alone no small interest will be aroused in the experimenter.                      *       *       *       *       *    For the beginning of the education of the musical sense, we use in  Rome a material which does not form part of the didactic apparatus as  it is sold at present. It consists of a double series of bells forming  an octave with tones and semitones. These metal bells, which stand  upon a wooden rectangular base, are all alike in appearance, but, when  struck with a little wooden hammer, give out sounds corresponding to  the notes doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh, doh [sharp], re  [sharp], fah [sharp], soh [sharp], lah [sharp].    [Illustration: Musical Scale (Chromatic)]    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--MUSICAL BELLS.]    One series of bells is arranged in chromatic order upon a long board,  upon which are painted rectangular spaces which are black and white  and of the same size as the bases which support the bells. As on a  pianoforte keyboard, the white spaces correspond to the tones, and the  black to the semitones. (Fig. 27.)    At first the only bells to be arranged upon the board are those which  correspond to the tones; these are set upon the white spaces in the  order of the musical notes, doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh.    To perform the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29691"],[0,"Taxidermy (#8)"],[1,"head may be handily set in a vise. This  will allow you to get all around it and the vise will hold it at any  angle, making sewing, etc., easier.    [Illustration: Fig. 34.]    Upon skull, for jaw muscles, and upon neck board wrap excelsior, packing  it hard as you go along, to required natural size. A raw skin will  settle better in drying if neck is slightly smaller than natural size.    To aid in wrapping close and firm to edge of neck base-board, drive a  row of small, broad headed nails half into the edge, two or three  inches apart all around and loop the winding-cord over these as the  wrapping proceeds. Drive these nails down when wrapping is completed.  (See Fig. 35 for finished wrapped excelsior head, ready for the skin.)    [Illustration: Fig. 35.]    Drop the dry ear cartilages into warm water. In this they will quickly  regain their natural shape. Using them as models make a pair of  duplicates of them of thin sheet lead which may be procured from a  plumber or hardware dealer. Split into the base of the cartilage so it  may be spread as nearly flat as possible and lay on the lead, drawing  around its outline with a nail point. Cut out the lead ears with a pair  of metal-shears. Hammer into natural concave shape with a bit of heavy  wood rounded into a ball at one end for the purpose. (For details of ear  making see Fig. 36).    [Illustration: Fig. 36.]    With the skin and mannikin in readiness make up a batch of plaster of  paris in thin glue water, only enough glue stirred in so that it can  barely be felt when the fingers are rubbed together in the water. This  should retard the plaster setting for from four to six hours and give  ample time for finishing the deer's face. This compo. will set  immediately if used in a skin that has been treated with formaldehyde,  sulphuric acid, or alum, as the glue becomes tanned and impotent by  them.    Make this compo. thick and stiff and mix into it some chopped manila  fiber. For finishing one deer face and ear-butts about a quart and a  half of the compo. should be made. This should cover the face thinly,  fill the ear-butts, set the eyes, and fill nose and mouth details out.    In beginning the setting of the scalp into place, cover the lead ears  thinly with the compo. and slip them into the ear skins. The lead will  have to be partly folded together to accomplish this and spread again  when inside. If edges of ears have been torn open in skinning, sew them  up neatly from the outside, using a small round needle and small thread  before the lead is placed.    With the cartilages set, fill the ear butts with compo., squeezing it  out upon the lead a little way that it may brace the ears when set  finally.    Set the mannikin in the vise for convenience. Cover skull with a thin  layer of compo. where bone is exposed and slip the face skin into place.  Hold the scalp up now by tying a heavy cord under the jaw and behind the  horns. Draw the neck skin into place and tie it up with a piece of cord  about the neck near base. Now, for better convenience in sewing, remove  the head from the vise, set front of neck base on the floor and lean the  antlers against a chair seat, back of neck up. Draw corners of antler  cuts together back of the horns.    Begin at one horn and sew to joint of the Y cut. Sew from the other horn  and then continue down the neck to the base, using medium stitches and  drawing tight. This method of sewing a game head is the only exception,  in taxidermy, to sewing toward the head. For a raw scalp use a sail  needle and waxed ends. For a tanned scalp, a large fur needle and strong  linen.    With the sewing completed, turn to nailing the scalp to the back-board.  Turn the free edge of skin down over back of board and nail firmly with  short broad headed nails so that when the surplus is trimmed off a  turned over edge of skin two or three inches wide will remain, held  snugly by nails set two inches apart. Count upon finishing a raw head  all up at one go when using the plaster compo. This is the only compo.  which can be recommended to hold raw, haired skins down, as the material  must set before the skin begins to dry and pull.    Before turning to finishing the face, unscrew the holding piece from  back of neck-board and nail up the part of skin's edge that it covered.  Replace the piece and set head in vise facing you. Pinch and mold the  ear skin tightly upon the compo. covered lead and model the ear-butts  into shape firmly against the head.    Run a strong-threaded fur needle, with large knot at end of thread,  through middle of upper edge of each lead ear. Draw ears up to desired  position and wrap thread around a convenient part of antlers to hold  until compo. sets. Next loop a cord under each ear at base of cartilage  and tie over antlers to hold lower end of cartilage from sagging until  set. When ears are finished, press face skin into compo. upon skull and  massage it down to hold firmly.    Fill eyelids thinly inside flap of lining, place a little compo. in  hollow of sockets, and set eyes.    [Illustration: Fig. 37.]    Deer are usually quite fleshy just over the eyes. Place this filling  before eyes are set. Also press a little compo. into the hollows of the  suborbital glands and with the fingers work these fleshy eye details out  roughly and finish with a modeling tool, pressing the slits of  suborbital glands in deeply with a thick-edged instrument. See that the  face skin is worked down firmly and smoothly clear to the nose.    Fill nose and upper lip and model them into natural shape. Lastly, fill  chin and lower lip. Tuck lower lip up well under upper and model lips  and chin into proper relation to each other.    If any compo. has gotten into the hair wipe it out with a damp sponge.  Leave head in the vise until compo. is set and then hang in a well  ventilated place to dry. Do not hang near stove or radiator.    When thoroughly dried out, brush dust out of hair and finish the  eyelids, nostrils, etc., with wax and cotton, burned in, same as given  for finishing a small mammal.    If placing the head upon a shield, use at least four strong screws of a  length to go nearly through the two boards.    For mounting a deer scalp tanned, the preparation is very different.  Scalps may be had tanned at a number of reputable fur houses throughout  the country at a small cost. To get best results, send scalps and  rug-skins in to the tanner with ears skinned out and eyelids and lips  split and nose cartilage pared out. Tanned scalps, if kept from moths,  may be preserved unmounted for a long time.    When required for mounting, a tanned scalp need only be relaxed with  water brushed or sponged into the flesh side and, when soft, poisoned  with arsenic-water and folded together, flesh to flesh, over one night.    The process of mounting a tanned scalp differs from the raw in that it  is set up on a wire and plaster shell, more carefully shaped than the  excelsior form. The entire scalp is stuck down to the shell with compo.  No. I rubbed well into the skin and upon the shell. The face and ears  are set and finished with compo. No. II, which, as before stated, is No.  I thickened to the consistency of modeling clay with plaster of paris.  This method gives much finer and more permanent results.    For details of plaster and wire mannikin, see Fig. 37. This type of  shell is made as follows: Set the cleaned skull upon neck-board and  back-board same as for wrapping excelsior neck.    Half-inch mesh chicken wire will do, if no free mesh wire can be  procured, for building the frame. The wire neck is best placed in  halves. The shaping will require considerable cutting and neat  manipulation with pincers and hammer and tying with bits of wire. Use  staple tacks to fasten wire to edge of back-board. The wire shell should  be smaller than natural neck to allow for coat of plaster and fiber. For  this make up not more than half a wash basin at a time, mixing the  plaster with plain water in the ordinary way. Make the batches middling  thick, enough so that it will not drizzle from the wire.    Pick a quantity of fiber into small handfuls. To apply, dip a film of  the manila fiber into the plaster, drag it out over edge of dish to  remove surplus plaster, and apply to wire shell. Work fast enough to  keep ahead of plaster setting. Wipe each application out smooth as you  go. Apply a thin coat, very smooth, all over the skull and model on the  jaw muscles with the plaster and fiber.    When plaster is set, surface the shell and remove all inequalities by  paring with an ordinary small butcher-knife. Allow to thoroughly dry and  apply a good coat of medium thin shellac. Have this type of mannikin  completed, dried, and shellaced before moistening and preparing the  tanned skin.    To prepare mammal skins in the field, for transportation and keeping,  remove skins carefully, same as for immediate mounting. Salt thoroughly,  rubbing in well, and roll up to drain over night. Next day shake out the  first salt, which will be found saturated with juices, rub fresh salt in  all over, and roll up over another night. In this condition small skins  may be sealed in glass jars or friction top tins and kept damp thus for  some time.    To make a preserving \"pickle\" for keeping skins wet, boil salt in water  until heaviest brine possible to make is produced. Add a tablespoonful  of carbolic acid to the gallon while hot. Stir well. Let the solution  cool thoroughly before submerging skins in it.    Skins should always be put through the double dry salting before going  into \"pickle.\" Keep in covered earthen jars.    For making up into rugs, send animal skins to a good tanner, first  skinning out the ears and paring out lips and nose.    To make an open-mouthed rug head, use the natural skull when possible.  Set the jaws open solidly with plaster of paris and at the same time lay  a plaster core between lower jaw for the artificial"]]]
