Human law recognizes this  underlying law of nature by forbidding man to tamper in a preventive  way with her hallowed and mysterious processes for perpetuating the  human race. Religious law, based on the divine dispensation of the  Scriptures, indorses the law of nature and that of the state.    We may take it, then, that \"birth control\" represents a deliberate and  reprehensible attempt to nullify those innate laws of reproduction  sanctioned by religion, tradition and man's own ingrained instinct. To  say that the human instinct for the perpetuation of his race and  family has become atrophied during the flight of time, and that he is  therefore justified in denying it, is merely begging the question. The  instinct may be denied, just as other higher and nobler instincts are  disregarded; but its validity cannot be questioned. Whether those who  practice \"birth control\" are influenced by economic, selfishly  personal or other reasons, they are offending in a threefold manner:  against the inborn wish and desire which is a priceless possession of  even the least of God's creatures, that of living anew in its  offspring; against the law of the state, which after all, stands for  the crystallization of the best feeling of the community; and against  the divine injunction handed down to us in Holy Writ, to \"increase and  multiply.\"    \"Birth control\" is the foe to the direct end and aim of marriage,  which, in the last analysis, is childbirth. As an enemy to the  procreation of children it is an enemy of the family and the family  group. As an enemy of the family, it is an enemy of the state, the  community, a foe to the whole social system. Mankind has been able to  attain its comparatively recent state of moral and physical  advancement without having recourse to the dangerous principle which  \"birth control\" represents. Surely that wise provision of our existing  legal code which makes the printing or dissemination of information  regarding the physical facts of \"birth control\" illegal and punishable  as an offense, can only be approved by those who respect the  Omnipotent will, and the time-hallowed traditions which date back to  the very inception of the race.                                        CHAPTER IX                                 SEX DISEASES      The sex diseases are the same in both sexes, whether developed by  direct or accidental infection. They are the greatest practical  argument in favor of continence, morality and marriage in the sex  relation.                                     GONORRHEA    Gonorrhea is a pus-discharging inflammation of the canal known as the  _urethra_, which passing through the entire length of the organ,  carries both the urine and the seminal fluid. It is caused by a  venereal bacillus, the _gonococcus_. Under favorable conditions and  with right treatment, gonorrhea may be cured, though violently  painful, in fourteen days. Often the inflammation extends, becomes  chronic and attacks other organs. This chronic gonorrhea often causes  permanent contraction of the urethra, which leads to the painful  retention of urine, catarrh of the bladder, and stone. Chronic  gonorrhea, too, often ends in death, especially if the kidneys are  attacked. A cured case of gonorrhea does not mean immunity from  further attacks. New infections are all the more easily acquired.  Gonorrhea has even more dangerous consequences in women than in men.  The _gonococcus_ bacilli infect all the inner female genital organs.  They cause frequent inflammations and lead to growths in the belly.  Women thus attacked usually are apt to be sterile; they suffer  agonies, and often become chronic invalids. The child born of a  gonorrheal mother, while passing through the infected genital organs,  comes to life with infected eyelids. This is _Blennorrhea_, which may  result in total blindness. Gonorrhea also causes inflammation of the  joints, gonorrheal rheumatism, testicular inflammations which may lead  to sterility. Some authorities claim that fully half the sterility in  women is caused by gonorrheal infection of the Fallopian tubes.  Gonorrheal infection of the eyes at birth is now prevented by first  washing them in a saturated solution of boric acid, then treating them  with a drop of weak silver solution.                                     SYPHILIS    Syphilis is a still more terrible venereal disease. It usually appears  first in small, hard sores, hard chancres, on the sexual parts or the  mouth. Then the syphilitic poison spreads throughout the whole body by  means of the blood. After a few weeks it breaks out on the face or  body. Its final cure is always questionable. Syphilis may lie dormant  for years, and then suddenly become active again. It breaks out in  sores on all parts of the body, often eats up the bone, destroys  internal organs, such as the liver, causes hardening of the lungs,  diseases of the blood vessels and eye diseases. Ulcers of the brain  and nerve paralysis often result from it. One of its most terrible  consequences is consumption of the spinal marrow and paralysis of the  brain, or paresis. The first slowly hardens and destroys the spinal  marrow, the second the brain. These diseases are only developed by  previous syphilitics. As a rule they occur from 5 to 20 years after  infection, usually 10 or 15 years after it. And they usually happen to  persons who believed themselves completely cured. Consumption of the  spinal marrow leads to death in the course of a few years of continual  torture. Paralysis of the brain turns the sufferer into a human ruin,  gradually extinguishing all mental and nervous functions, sentience,  movement, speech and intellect.    One danger of syphilis is the fact that its true nature may be  overlooked during the first period, because of the lack of pronounced  symptoms. Its early sores may easily be mistaken for some skin  affection. Mercury and other means are successful in doing away with  at least the more noticeable signs of syphilis during the first and  secondary stages. The modern medical treatment using mercury and  Salvarsan (606) in alternation, has been very successful. It is  claimed that by following it, syphilis may be totally cured if taken  in hand during the first stage. The sores developed during the first  two or three years of the disease are very infectious. In the case of  a chronic syphilis of three or four years' standing, the sores as a  rule are no longer infectious. It is possible, however, for a  syphilitic of this description to bring forth syphilitic children,  _without infecting his wife_. Such children either die at birth, or  later, of this congenital syphilis. They may also die of spinal  consumption or paresis between the ages of 10 and 20. The mortality of  all syphilitic children is very great. In most cases, however, healthy  children are born of the wedlock of _relatively cured_ syphilitics,  though they are often sterile. Young men who have had recourse to  prostitutes, often inoculate their wives with gonorrhea or syphilis,  and thus the plague is spread.                                 THE SOFT CHANCRE    The soft chancre is the third form of venereal disease (the hard  chancre being the first stage of syphilis). It is the least dangerous  of the venereal diseases, but unfortunately, relatively the one which  occurs most seldom. When not complicated with syphilis, it appears  locally. It is a larger or smaller sore feeding and growing on the  genital organs.                    VENEREAL DISEASE AN ADVOCATE OF CONTINENCE    The most tragic consequence of all venereal disease is the part it  plays in the infection of innocent children, and innocent wives and  mothers. Often a pure and chaste woman is thus deprived in the most  cruel and brutal manner of the fruit of all her hopes and dreams of  happiness. Similarly, a young man may find himself hopelessly  condemned to a short life of pain and misery. He may also suffer from  the knowledge that he has ruined the lives of those dearest to him.  Venereal disease, syphilis in particular, emphasizes the _practical_  value of continence--quite aside from its moral one--in a manner which  cannot be ignored!                                         CHAPTER X                                 LOVE AND SEX      When we take under consideration the higher, truer love of one sex for  the other, that is, an affection which is not simply a friendship, but  has a sex basis, we realize that it may be a very noble emotion. There  is no manner of doubt but that the normal human being feels a great  need for love. Sex in love and its manifestation in the life of the  soul is one of the first conditions of human happiness, and a main aim  of human existence.    All know the tale of Cupid's arrow. A man falls in love with a face, a  pair of eyes, the sound of a voice, and his affection is developed  from this trifling beginning until it takes complete possession of  him. This love is usually made up of two components: a sex instinct,  and feelings of sympathy and interest which hark back to primal times.  And this love, in its true sense, should stand for an affection  purified from egoism.    When, among the lower animal forms we find individuals without a  determined sex, egoism develops free from all restraint. Each  individual creature devours as much as it can and feeding, together  with propagation by division, \"budding\" or conjunction, makes up the  total of its vital activities. It need do no more to accomplish the  purpose of its existence. Even when propagation commences to take  place by means of individual male and female parents, the same  principle of egoism largely obtains. The spiders are typical instances  of this: in their case the carrying out of the natural functions of  the male spider is attended with much danger for him, owing to the  fact that if he does not exercise the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23691"],[0,"Archeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895 (#8)"],[1,"is depicted the figure of a mountain lion. The whole pictograph  is 3-1/2 feet square, and legible in all its parts.    The intent of the ancient scribe is not wholly clear, but it has been  suggested that he sought to represent the nexus of irrigating ditches  in the plain below. It might have been intended as a chart of the  neighboring fields of corn, and it is highly suggestive, if we adopt  either of these explanations or interpretations, that a figure of the  mountain lion is found near the depressions, which may provisionally  be regarded as representing ancient reservoirs. Among the Tusayan  Indians the mountain lion is looked on as a guardian of cultivated  fields, which he is said to protect, and his stone image is sometimes  placed there for the same purpose.    In the vicinity of the pictograph last described other bowlders, of  which there are many, were found to be covered with smaller rock  etchings in no respect characteristic, and there is a remnant of an  ancient shrine a few yards away from the bowlder upon which they  occur.      MONTEZUMA WELL    One of the most interesting sites of ancient habitation in Verde  valley is known as Montezuma Well, and it is remarkable how little  attention has been paid to it by archeologists.[21] Dr Mearns, in his  article on the ancient dwellings of Verde valley, does not mention the  well, and Mindeleff simply refers to the brief description by Dr  Hoffman in 1877. These ruins are worthy of more study than I was able  to give them, for like many other travelers I remained but a short  time in the neighborhood. It is possible, however, that some of my  hurried observations at this point may be worthy of record.    Montezuma Well (plate XCIV) is an irregular, circular depression,  closely resembling a volcanic crater, but evidently, as Dr Hoffman  well points out, due to erosion rather than to volcanic agencies. As  one approaches it from a neighboring ranch the road ascends a low  elevation, and when on top the visitor finds that the crater occupies  the whole interior of the hill. The exact dimensions I did not  accurately determine, but the longest diameter of the excavation is  estimated at about 400 feet; its depth possibly 70 feet. On the  eastern side this depression is separated from Beaver creek by a  precipitous wall which can not be scaled from that side. At the time  of my visit there was considerable water in the \"well,\" which was  reported to be very deep, but did not cover the whole bottom. It is  possible to descend to the water at one point on the eastern side,  where a trail leads to the water's edge.    There appears to be a subterranean waterway under the eastern rim of  the well, and the water from the spring rushes through this passage  into Beaver creek. At the time of my visit this outflow was very  considerable, and in the rainy season it must be much greater. The  well is never dry, and is supplied by perennial subterranean springs  rather than by surface drainage.    The geological agency which has been potent in giving the remarkable  crater-like form to Montezuma Well was correctly recognized by Dr  Hoffman[22] and others as the solvent or erosive power of the spring.  There is no evidence of volcanic formation in the neighborhood, and  the surrounding rocks are limestones and sandstones. Not far from  Navaho springs there is a similar circular depression, called Jacob's  Well, but which was dry when visited by me. This may later be found to  have been formed in a similar way. At several places in Arizona there  are formations of like geological character.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCIV    MONTEZUMA WELL]    The walls of Montezuma Well are so nearly perpendicular that descent  to the edge of the water is difficult save by a single trail which  follows the detritus to a cave on one side. In this cave, the roof of  which is not much higher than the water level, there are fragments  of masonry, as if structures of some kind had formerly been erected in  it. I have regarded this cave rather as a place of religious rites  than of former habitation, possibly a place of retreat for ancient  priests when praying for rain or moisture, or a shrine for the deposit  of prayer offerings to rain or water gods.    Several isolated cliff dwellings are built at different levels in the  sides of the cliffs. One of the best of these is diametrically  opposite the cave mentioned above, a few feet below the rim of the  depression. While this house was entered with little difficulty, there  were others which I did not venture to visit.    The accompanying illustration (plate XCV) gives an idea of the general  appearance of one of these cliff houses of Montezuma Well. It is built  under an overhanging archway of rock in a deep recess, with masonry on  three sides. The openings are shown, one of which overlooks the  spring; the other is an entrance at one side. The face of masonry on  the front is not plastered, and if it was formerly rough cast the mud  has been worn away, leaving the stones exposed. The side wall, which  has been less exposed to the elements, still retains the plastering,  which is likewise found on the inner walls where it is quite smooth in  places.    The number of cliff rooms in the walls of the well is small and their  capacity, if used as dwellings, very limited. There are, however,  ruins of pueblos of some size on the edge of the well.    One of the largest of these, shown in the accompanying illustration  (plate XCVI), is situated on the neck of land separating the well from  the valley of Beaver creek. This pueblo was rectangular in form, of  considerable size, built of stones, and although at present almost  demolished, shows perfectly the walls of former rooms. Fragments of  ancient pottery would seem to indicate that the people who once  inhabited this pueblo were in no respect different from other  sedentary occupants of Verde valley. From their housetops they had a  wide view over the creek on one side and the spring on the other,  defending, by the site of their village, the one trail by which  descent to the well was possible.    The remarkable geological character of Montezuma Well, and the spring  within it, would have profoundly impressed itself on the folklore of  any people of agricultural bent who lived in its neighborhood after  emigrating to more arid lands. About a month after my visit to this  remarkable spring I described the place to some of the old priests at  Walpi and showed them sketches of the ruins. These priests seemed to  have legendary knowledge of a place somewhat like it where they said  the Great Plumed Snake had one of his numerous houses. They reminded  me of a legend they had formerly related to me of how the Snake arose  from a great cavity or depression in the ground, and how, they had  heard, water boiled out of that hole into a neighboring river. The  Hopi have personal knowledge of Montezuma Well, for many of their  number have visited Verde valley, and they claim the ruins there as  the homes of their ancestors. It would not be strange, therefore, if  this marvelous crater was regarded by them as a house of Palueluekon,  their mythic Plumed Serpent.    Practically little is known of the pictography of this part of the  Verde valley people, although it has an important bearing on the  distribution of the cliff dwellers of the Southwest. There is evidence  of at least two kinds of petroglyphs, indicative of two distinct  peoples. One of these was of the Apache Mohave; the other, the  agriculturists who built the cliff homes and villages of the plain.  Those of the latter are almost identical with the work of the Pueblo  peoples in the cliff dweller stage, from southern Utah and Colorado to  the Mexican boundary. It is not a difficult task to distinguish the  pictography of these two peoples, wherever found. The pictographs of  the latter are generally pecked into the rock with a sharpened  implement, probably of stone, while those of the former are usually  scratched or painted on the surface of the rocks. Their main  differences, however, are found in the character of the designs and  the objects represented. This difference can be described only by  considering individual rock drawings, but the practiced eye may  readily distinguish the two kinds at a glance. The pictographs which  are pecked in the cliff are, as a rule, older than those which are  drawn or scratched, and resemble more closely those widely spread in  the Pueblo area, for if the cliff-house people ever made painted  pictographs, as there is every reason to believe they did, time has  long ago obliterated them.    The pictured rocks (plate XCVII) near Cliff's ranch, on Beaver creek,  four miles from Montezuma Well, have a great variety of objects  depicted upon them. These rocks, which rise from the left bank of the  creek opposite Cliff's ranch, bear over a hundred different rock  pictures, figures of which are seen in the accompanying illustration.  The rock surface is a layer of black malpais, through which the totem  signatures have been pecked, showing the light stone beneath, and thus  rendering them very conspicuous. Among these pictographs many familiar  forms are recognizable, among them being the crane or blue heron,  bears' and badgers' paws, turtles, snakes, antelopes, earth symbols,  spirals, and meanders.    Among these many totems there was an unusual pictograph in the form of  the figure 8, above which was a bear's paw accompanied by a human  figure so common in southwestern rock etchings. A square figure with  interior parallel squares extending to the center is also found, as  elsewhere, in cliff-dweller pictography.
