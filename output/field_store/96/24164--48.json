Thus hath Theopompus abused the city of Athens,  Polycrates that of Lacedemon, as hath he hat wrote the Tripoliticus  [for he is not Theopompus, as is supposed by some] done by the city of  Thebes. Timeils also hath greatly abused the foregoing people and others  also; and this ill-treatment they use chiefly when they have a contest  with men of the greatest reputation; some out of envy and malice, and  others as supposing that by this foolish talking of theirs they may be  thought worthy of being remembered themselves; and indeed they do by no  means fail of their hopes, with regard to the foolish part of mankind,  but men of sober judgment still condemn them of great malignity.    25. Now the Egyptians were the first that cast reproaches upon us;  in order to please which nation, some others undertook to pervert the  truth, while they would neither own that our forefathers came into Egypt  from another country, as the fact was, nor give a true account of our  departure thence. And indeed the Egyptians took many occasions to hate  us and envy us: in the first place, because our ancestors had had the  dominion over their country? and when they were delivered from them, and  gone to their own country again, they lived there in prosperity. In the  next place, the difference of our religion from theirs hath occasioned  great enmity between us, while our way of Divine worship did as much  exceed that which their laws appointed, as does the nature of God  exceed that of brute beasts; for so far they all agree through the whole  country, to esteem such animals as gods, although they differ one  from another in the peculiar worship they severally pay to them. And  certainly men they are entirely of vain and foolish minds, who have  thus accustomed themselves from the beginning to have such bad notions  concerning their gods, and could not think of imitating that decent  form of Divine worship which we made use of, though, when they saw our  institutions approved of by many others, they could not but envy us on  that account; for some of them have proceeded to that degree of folly  and meanness in their conduct, as not to scruple to contradict their own  ancient records, nay, to contradict themselves also in their writings,  and yet were so blinded by their passions as not to discern it.    26. And now I will turn my discourse to one of their principal writers,  whom I have a little before made use of as a witness to our antiquity; I  mean Manetho. [22] He promised to interpret the Egyptian history out of  their sacred writings, and premised this: that \"our people had come into  Egypt, many ten thousands in number, and subdued its inhabitants;\"  and when he had further confessed that \"we went out of that country  afterward, and settled in that country which is now called Judea, and  there built Jerusalem and its temple.\" Now thus far he followed his  ancient records; but after this he permits himself, in order to appear  to have written what rumors and reports passed abroad about the Jews,  and introduces incredible narrations, as if he would have the Egyptian  multitude, that had the leprosy and other distempers, to have been mixed  with us, as he says they were, and that they were condemned to fly out  of Egypt together; for he mentions Amenophis, a fictitious king's name,  though on that account he durst not set down the number of years of  his reign, which yet he had accurately done as to the other kings he  mentions; he then ascribes certain fabulous stories to this king,  as having in a manner forgotten how he had already related that the  departure of the shepherds for Jerusalem had been five hundred and  eighteen years before; for Tethmosis was king when they went away.  Now, from his days, the reigns of the intermediate kings, according to  Manethe, amounted to three hundred and ninety-three years, as he says  himself, till the two brothers Sethos and Hermeus; the one of whom,  Sethos, was called by that other name of Egyptus, and the other,  Hermeus, by that of Danaus. He also says that Sethos east the other out  of Egypt, and reigned fifty-nine years, as did his eldest son Rhampses  reign after him sixty-six years. When Manethe therefore had acknowledged  that our forefathers were gone out of Egypt so many years ago, he  introduces his fictitious king Amenophis, and says thus: \"This king  was desirous to become a spectator of the gods, as had Orus, one of  his predecessors in that kingdom, desired the same before him; he also  communicated that his desire to his namesake Amenophis, who was the son  of Papis, and one that seemed to partake of a divine nature, both as  to wisdom and the knowledge of futurities.\" Manethe adds, \"how this  namesake of his told him that he might see the gods, if he would clear  the whole country of the lepers and of the other impure people; that the  king was pleased with this injunction, and got together all that had any  defect in their bodies out of Egypt; and that their number was eighty  thousand; whom he sent to those quarries which are on the east side of  the Nile, that they might work in them, and might be separated from the  rest of the Egyptians.\" He says further, that \"there were some of the  learned priests that were polluted with the leprosy; but that still this  Amenophis, the wise man and the prophet, was afraid that the gods would  be angry at him and at the king, if there should appear to have been  violence offered them; who also added this further, [out of his sagacity  about futurities,] that certain people would come to the assistance of  these polluted wretches, and would conquer Egypt, and keep it in their  possession thirteen years; that, however, he durst not tell the king  of these things, but that he left a writing behind him about all those  matters, and then slew himself, which made the king disconsolate.\" After  which he writes thus verbatim: \"After those that were sent to work in  the quarries had continued in that miserable state for a long while, the  king was desired that he would set apart the city Avaris, which was then  left desolate of the shepherds, for their habitation and protection;  which desire he granted them. Now this city, according to the ancient  theology, was Typho's city. But when these men were gotten into it, and  found the place fit for a revolt, they appointed themselves a ruler out  of the priests of Hellopolis, whose name was Osarsiph, and they took  their oaths that they would be obedient to him in all things. He then,  in the first place, made this law for them, That they should neither  worship the Egyptian gods, nor should abstain from any one of those  sacred animals which they have in the highest esteem, but kill and  destroy them all; that they should join themselves to nobody but to  those that were of this confederacy. When he had made such laws as  these, and many more such as were mainly opposite to the customs of the  Egyptians, [23] he gave order that they should use the multitude of the  hands they had in building walls about their City, and make themselves  ready for a war with king Amenophis, while he did himself take into his  friendship the other priests, and those that were polluted with them,  and sent ambassadors to those shepherds who had been driven out of the  land by Tefilmosis to the city called Jerusalem; whereby he informed  them of his own affairs, and of the state of those others that had been  treated after such an ignominious manner, and desired that they would  come with one consent to his assistance in this war against Egypt. He  also promised that he would, in the first place, bring them back  to their ancient city and country Avaris, and provide a plentiful  maintenance for their multitude; that he would protect them and fight  for them as occasion should require, and would easily reduce the  country under their dominion. These shepherds were all very glad of this  message, and came away with alacrity all together, being in number two  hundred thousand men; and in a little time they came to Avaris. And now  Amenophis the king of Egypt, upon his being informed of their invasion,  was in great confusion, as calling to mind what Amenophis, the son  of Papis, had foretold him; and, in the first place, he assembled the  multitude of the Egyptians, and took counsel with their leaders, and  sent for their sacred animals to him, especially for those that were  principally worshipped in their temples, and gave a particular charge to  the priests distinctly, that they should hide the images of their gods  with the utmost care he also sent his son Sethos, who was also named  Ramesses, from his father Rhampses, being but five years old, to a  friend of his. He then passed on with the rest of the Egyptians, being  three hundred thousand of the most warlike of them, against the enemy,  who met them. Yet did he not join battle with them; but thinking  that would be to fight against the gods, he returned back and came to  Memphis, where he took Apis and the other sacred animals which he had  sent for to him, and presently marched into Ethiopia, together with  his whole army and multitude of Egyptians; for the king of Ethiopia was  under an obligation to him, on which account he received him, and took  care of all the multitude that was with him, while the country supplied  all that was necessary for the food of the men. He also allotted cities  and villages"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#8)"],[1,"jar, and set on ice. Do this at least six hours  before serving so the sugar shall be fully dissolved. Four lumps to the  large goblet is about right--with half a gobletful of fresh cold water.  At serving time, rub a zest of lemon around the rim of each goblet--the  goblets must be well chilled--then half fill with the dissolved sugar,  add a tablespoonful of cracked ice, and stand sprigs of mint thickly all  around the rim. Set the goblets in the tray, then fill up with whiskey  or brandy or both, mixed--the mixture is best with brands that blend  smoothly. Drop in the middle a fresh ripe strawberry, or cherry, or  slice of red peach, and serve at once. Fruit can be left out without  harm to flavor--it is mainly for the satisfaction of the eye. But never  by any chance bruise the mint--it will give an acrid flavor \"most  tolerable and not to be endured.\" To get the real old-time effect, serve  with spoons in the goblets rather than straws. In dipping and sipping  more of the mint-essence comes out--beside the clinking of the spoons is  nearly as refreshing as the tinkle of the ice.    _Lemon Punch_: Bring a gallon of fresh water to a bubbling boil in a  wide kettle, and as it strikes full boil throw into it a tablespoonful  of tea--whatever brand you like best. Let boil one minute--no more, no  less, then strain, boiling hot, upon the juice and thin yellow peel of  twelve large or eighteen small lemons, along with two pounds of lump  sugar. Stir hard until the sugar is dissolved, then add a pint of rum.  Stand on ice twelve to twenty-four hours to blend and ripen. Put a small  block of clear ice in the punch bowl, pour in the punch, then add to it  either Maraschino cherries, or hulled small ripe strawberries, or  pineapple or bananas, peeled and cut in tiny dice--or a mixture of all  these. Serve in chilled punch cups, with after-dinner coffee spoons for  the fruit. The fruit can be left out, and the punch served with  sandwiches the same as iced tea. A wineglass of yellow chartreuse, added  just after the rum, is to many palates an improvement. So is a very  little peach or apricot brandy.    _Punch a la Ruffle Shirts_: This recipe comes down from the epoch of  knee buckles and ruffled shirts, and is warranted to more than hold its  own with any other--even the so-famous \"Artillery punch,\" beloved of  army and navy. To make it, scrub clean and pare thinly the yellow peel  of two dozen oranges and one dozen lemons. Put the pared peel in a deep  glass pitcher and cover it with one quart of brandy, one quart of old  whiskey, one generous pint of Jamaica rum, one tumbler of cherry bounce,  one tumbler of peach liqueur, or else a tumbler of \"peach and honey,\"  Cover with cloth and let stand three days off ice to blend and ripen.  Meantime squeeze and strain the juice of the oranges and lemons upon  four pounds of best lump sugar, shred a large, very ripe pineapple fine  and put it with another pound of sugar in a separate vessel. Hull half a  gallon of ripe strawberries, cover them liberally with sugar and let  stand to extract the juice. Lacking strawberries, use ripe peaches, or  blackberries or even seeded cherries. Keep the fruit and sugar cool, but  not too cold--just so it will not sour. Upon the third morning strain  the juice of all fruits together, and mix thoroughly. Next make a gallon  of weak green tea, strain it boiling hot upon the liquor and the yellow  peel, stir well, then mix in the fruit juices and sugar, and let stand  uncovered until cool. Chill thoroughly, also chill the wine. Use  whatever sort you prefer--claret, sound and fruity, is good, so is  almost any homemade wine of the first class. American champagne pleases  some palates. But I advise rather claret, or good homemade grape wine.  Put into the punch bowl a block of clear ice, add equal measures of the  mixture and the wine. Let stand half an hour before serving. Put in at  the very last vichy, ice-cold. Thin strips of fresh cucumber peel add a  trifle to flavor and more to looks.    The wine and mixture can be poured together into demijohns and kept for  months, provided they are kept cool. Since the making is rather  troublesome it is worth while to make the full quantity at once and keep  it on hand for emergencies. Commercial liqueurs can take the place of  the homemade ones here set forth. The result may not be quite so  distinctive, but will not be disappointing. Dry sherry is a good  substitute for cherry bounce, likewise apricot brandy, while vermouth or  chartreuse will answer for peach liqueur, which is unlikely to be in  hand unless you are a very old-fashioned housekeeper.    _Peach Liqueur_: Peel a peck of very ripe, very juicy peaches, cut from  the seed, weigh, and pack down in earthen or agate ware with their own  weight in granulated sugar. Crack the seeds, take out the kernels,  blanche the same as almonds, and put to soak in a quart of brandy. Let  stand in sunshine to extract the flavor, a full day. Let the fruit and  sugar stand twenty-four hours, then put over fire in a preserving kettle  and simmer very slowly until the fruit is in rags, adding now and then  enough boiling water to make up for what cooks out. If spices are  approved, simmer with the fruit, a pinch of blade mace, some whole  cloves and half a dozen black pepper corns. This is optional. Strain  without pressing to avoid cloudiness, and mix the juice while still very  hot with the brandy and soaked kernels. Add brandy and kernels, also a  quart of whiskey--there should be a gallon of the fruit juice. Stir hard  so as to blend well. Let cool, and bottle or put in demijohns, taking  care to apportion the kernels equally. They will sink to the bottom,  but the liqueur will fatten on them, getting thereby a delicate almond  fragrance and flavor.    _Strawberry Liqueur_: Wash, hull and mash two gallons of very ripe  strawberries, put over the fire, bring to a quick boil, skim clean, and  simmer for five minutes. Throw in a pint of boiling water, and strain as  for jelly. Measure the juice--for each pint take a pound of sugar,  return to the kettle, simmer fifteen minutes, skimming clean the while,  then take from the fire, measure, and to each quart add a pint of good  whiskey, or whiskey and brandy mixed. Bottle while still hot, and seal.  Small bottles are best. By adding spices to taste while the juice is  simmering you turn the liqueur into strawberry cordial.    _Blackberry Cordial_: Pick over, wash and drain well half a bushel of  very ripe, but sound berries. Mash, add a very little cold water, and  simmer for half an hour, then strain and measure the juice. Put a pound  of sugar to each pint, and to each gallon, a teaspoon of cloves, the  same of allspice, a race of ginger well bruised, a tiny pod of Cayenne  pepper, and a half dozen black pepper corns. Tie the spices loosely in  very thin muslin so they may not be skimmed off. Skim away all froth,  and cook for an hour, keeping the kettle barely boiling. It should  reduce about one-half. Take from the fire and add spirits, either  whiskey or brandy, in the proportion of one to two--two pints cordial to  one of liquor. Let cool uncovered, bottle and cork tight--sealing is  unnecessary. Excellent for convalescents, especially children. To make  it almost a specific for bowel troubles, dig up, and wash clean,  dewberry roots, cut short, and boil in clear water, making a very strong  decoction. Add this to the cordial while still boiling, in proportion of  one to four. Then mix in the spirits. A quart of cordial can be thus  treated medicinally, and the rest kept for ordinary uses.    _Blackberry Wine_: Pick, wash, and mash thoroughly, sound ripe berries,  pour upon each gallon a gallon of freshly-boiling water, and let stand  twenty-four hours. Strain, measure juice, allow three and one-half  pounds sugar to each gallon of it. Put into clean cask or jugs, do not  fill, but leave room for fermentation. Cover mouth or bung-hole with  thin cloth, and let stand in clean warm air for two months. Rack off  into clean vessels, throwing away the lees, and cork or cover close. Fit  for use in another month. Improves with age up to a year.    _Strawberry Wine_: Mash thoroughly clean, hulled, very ripe berries, add  equal bulk of boiling water, let stand six hours, then strain. Put the  strained juice in a preserving kettle with two and a half pounds of  sugar to each gallon. Bring to a boil, skim clean, then pour into clean  vessels, close mouths with thin cloth, and let stand until fermentation  ceases. In a wet season the berries are likely to be so juicy, less  water is required--or more sugar necessary.    _Gooseberry Wine_: Wash and drain dead-ripe gooseberries, mash them  thoroughly with a wooden pestle, and add their own bulk of boiling  water. Let stand thirty-six hours unless the weather is very warm--then  twenty-four will be long enough. Press out all the juice, even though it  runs muddy. Measure, and to each gallon add three pounds down-weight, of  the best lump sugar. Stir well, repeating every day for a week, then  cover with lawn and let stand till fermentation ceases. Cover tight then  and leave standing six weeks longer, so the wine may fatten on the lees.  Back off carefully, filtering the muddy part at the bottom through  several thicknesses of cheese cloth. Put in a clean vessel for two  months longer, then bottle and seal. If the bottles are laid on the  side, and the wine carefully decanted it will show a bright golden  yellow with much the translucence of topaz. It reaches perfection at a  year. Being rather heavy it is improved to many palates by adding  ice-cold vichy after it is in the glasses.    _Grape Wine_: Pick from stems, wash, drain, and mash thoroughly, ripe  sound grapes. Add measure for measure of full-boiling water, and let  stand twelve hours. If very deep color is desired, and the grapes are  black, let stand twenty-four. Strain, measure juice, add to each "]]]
