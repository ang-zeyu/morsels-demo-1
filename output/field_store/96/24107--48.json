Put into a pan, sprinkle on a little flour and toss the potatoes about  with your hand until some flour adheres to each piece. Cover these  floured potatoes with small bits of butter. If the butter is put in in  one piece the potatoes get broken before the butter reaches them all.    Sprinkle in a little salt and put in enough cream so that they are about  half covered. If you use more cream they will cook too tender and be  mushy before the cream is cooked down. Stand by them. Stir with a knife  blade lifting them from the bottom but not turning them over.    When they begin to glisten lift them to a hot serving dish and put them  where they will keep warm but will not cook any further.    If you have not cream add a little more butter but the cream is better  than the butter.

[Illustration]      French Fried Potatoes    Wash and pare the potatoes and cut into any desired shape. Drain well.  Fry in smoking fat until nicely browned, then drain on browned paper.  Season well and serve.      Potatoes Au Gratin    Cut cold boiled potatoes into cubes and make a cream dressing. Butter  the baking dish, put in a layer of potatoes and then a layer of the  dressing, then sprinkle with a little parmesan cheese; now a layer of  potatoes and then a layer of dressing and then cheese, put in oven and  allow them to brown.      Potato Croquettes    Pare sweet or white potatoes and boil as for mashed potatoes. When done  and mashed add a good lump of butter and season well; add a little hot  milk, form into croquettes and dip into beaten egg, then in bread or  cracker crumbs. Cook in deep fat. Garnish with parsley.                Let the sky rain potatoes.--Shakespeare      Pittsburgh Potatoes              1 onion            1 quart potato cubes            1/2 can pimentos            2 cups white sauce            1/2 lb. cheese            1 teaspoon salt    Cook potatoes with chopped onion. Drain and add pimentos cut fine. Pour  white sauce over; stir in cheese; bake in a moderate oven.      Sweet Potato Souffle    Boil some sweet potatoes and ripe chestnuts separately, adding a little  sugar to the water in which the chestnuts are boiled.    Mash all well together and add some cream and butter and beat until  light. Then place for a minute or two in the oven to brown.      Potatoes a la Lyonnaise    Cut cold boiled potatoes into tiny dice of uniform size. Put two great  spoonfuls of butter into the frying pan and fry two sliced onions in  this for three minutes. With a skimmer remove the onions and turn the  potatoes into the hissing butter. Toss and turn with a fork, that the  dice may not become brown. When hot, add a teaspoon of finely chopped  parsley and cook a minute longer. Remove the potatoes from the pan with  a perforated spoon, that the fat may drip from them. Serve very hot.      Stuffed Potatoes    Wash good sized potatoes. Bake them and cut off tops with a sharp knife,  and with a teaspoon scoop out the inside of each potato. Put this in a  bowl with two ounces of butter, the yolks of two eggs, salt to taste,  pepper and sugar.      Potato Dumplings    To be served with German Pot Roast or Beef a la mode.              4 large raw potatoes grated            8 large boiled potatoes grated            2 eggs            3/4 cup bread crumbs            1 tablespoon melted butter    Mix eggs with grated raw potatoes, add bread crumbs and butter, lastly  grated boiled potatoes and salt, mix flour with the hands while forming  dumplings size of large egg, drop at once into boiling salted water.    Boil twenty minutes, drain, lay on platter and sprinkle with fried  chopped onions, bread crumbs browned in butter.      Potato Puffers    Peel and grate 8 large potatoes, one onion, mix at once with two or  three eggs (before potatoes have time to discolor). Have spider very hot  with plenty of hot fat.    Drop into flat cakes 3 in. in diameter, fry crisp brown on one side then  turn and fry second side. Serve immediately with apple sauce or stewed  fruit of any kind.      Stuffed Tomatoes    (Luncheon Dish.)              5 large tomatoes            1 tablespoon minced green (sweet) peppers            minced onion            3 or 4 pork sausages            2 cups bread crumbs            1 teaspoon or tablespoon of minced parsley            salt and pepper            1 tablespoon melted butter    Boil the sausages ten minutes, then skin and chop fine. Hollow your  tomatoes using about 1/2 cup of the solid parts, chopping fine. Mix all  thoroughly then heap into the tomato shells. Put large tablespoon butter  in baking pan and bake about 20 minutes in hot oven.    Green peppers and sausages can be omitted if so preferred.    This stuffed tomato served with bread and butter can be used as a first  course instead of bouillon and also can be used as a substitute for  meat.      Baked Tomatoes              8 large smooth tomatoes            2 green peppers            1 tsp. salt            1 1/2 pints milk            1 good sized onion            1 1/2 T. sugar            flour    Wash tomatoes, do not peel, slice piece from top of each and scoop out a  little of the tomato. Cut peppers in two lengthwise and remove  seeds--place in cold water.    Now put onion and peppers through meat chopper, sprinkle a little sugar  and a little salt over each tomato and place in good sized baking dish;  now put ground onion and ground peppers on top of tomato.    Put butter in skillet and when melted, not brown, stir in flour until a  paste is formed, now add gradually the milk as you would for cream  dressing, stir constantly.    The dressing must be very thick to allow for the water from the  tomatoes. Put this sauce around the tomatoes, not on top and place in a  moderate oven to bake about one hour slow. Serve if possible in the same  dish in which it was baked as it is very attractive.                                                   MARY ROBERTS RINEHART.    [Illustration]      Green String Beans              1/4 Peck    Fry in ham or bacon, 1 onion; add 1 cup tomatoes, 1 sprig thyme, 1 clove  garlic--parsley. Add beans and 1 cup water. Cook 1 1/2 hours.      Fresh Beans (Green or Yellow.)              1/4 peck beans            1 good size onion            1/2 clove of garlic            2 small tomatoes            1 pinch of thyme            1/2 tablespoon butter            1/2 tablespoon bacon fat            Salt to taste    Cut beans lengthwise very thin. Put butter and bacon fat in saucepan.  Cut up onion and let it fry to a light brown. Then wash beans and put  them in the fat. Add garlic and tomatoes, (cut up) and thyme--a little  salt and a little water. Cook.      Barbouillade              A dish from \"fair Provence\"    1 large or two small egg-plants; two cucumbers; four onions; six  tomatoes; 1 green pepper.    Peel and cut separately all vegetables; fry sliced onions in a teaspoon  of lard; add tomatoes, crushing them and stirring until quite soft; add  half a teaspoon of salt, then the cucumber, egg-plant, and green pepper,  stirring over a hot fire for ten minutes; place over a slow fire and  stew for three hours.    If the vegetables are fresh and tender, nothing else is needed, but if  they are somewhat dry, add a cupful of stock.    Cold barbouillade is excellent to spread on bread for sandwiches.    Barbouillade is usually served hot with rice boiled a la Creole.      Boiled Rice    Wash very thoroughly one cupful of rice; boil for twenty minutes in  three quarts of boiling water; drain and shake well, pour cold water  over the rice to separate the grains, and set in the oven a few minutes  to keep hot.      Spinach    Wash thoroughly, then throw into cold water and bring to boiling point;  then add 1/4 teaspoon of soda and boil 5 minutes. Turn into colander,  let cold water run over it, drain well, squeezing out water with spoon,  then chop very fine; add creamed butter, salt and pepper.    Heat again thoroughly, then serve with hard boiled eggs sliced on top.      Spaghetti              1/2 box Spaghetti            1 can tomatoes            1/2 large onion            1 teaspoon salt            1/8 teaspoon pepper            3 tablespoons sugar            1 tablespoon flour            1 pint water            1 tablespoon butter            1 1/2 lbs. boiling meat            Sap Sago or Parmesan cheese.    Boil spaghetti twenty-five minutes in salt water, drain, and run cold  water over it to separate.    While the spaghetti is boiling make sauce as follows: put the butter in  the skillet and when hot put in the onion and let brown. Then add the  tomatoes, meat, water, salt, pepper, sugar and cook thoroughly for one  and one-half hours. Then add flour mixed with a little water; thicken to  the consistency of cream; strain.    Take baking dish and place a layer of spaghetti, then a layer of sauce,  then sprinkle this with the cheese, continue until the pan is filled,  allowing cheese to be on the top.    Bake one-half hour in a moderate oven.      Baked Beans              1 quart beans            1 scant teaspoon baking soda            3 tablespoons molasses            1/4 pound salt pork            1/4 pound bacon            3 tablespoons vinegar            1/2 teaspoon mustard            salt and pepper to taste            3 tablespoons catsup    Soak beans over night in luke warm water with soda. In morning pour off  water and wash in cold water. Now place salt pork in bottom of bean  crock and put layers of beans on top, sprinkle with pepper and salt,  when filled nearly to top put on slices of bacon.    Now blend mustard with vinegar, now add molasses and catsup and pour  over the beans and fill up and over the top with luke warm water. Bake  in a slow oven for at least six hours, longer if necessary.

If the gods have any resentment against us, let the whole     weight of vengeance fall on my head. I fear not their vengeance     --but spare my child; and I earnestly entreat you, Toobo Totai     [the god whom he had evoked], to exert all your influence with     the other gods that I alone may suffer all the punishment they     desire to inflict (vol. i. p. 354).    So when the king of Israel has sinned by \"numbering the people,\" and  they are punished for his fault by a pestilence which slays seventy  thousand innocent men, David cries to Jahveh:--       Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep,     what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me,     and against my father's house. (2 Sam. xxiv. 17).    Human sacrifices were extremely common in Polynesia; and, in Tonga, the  \"devotion\" of a child by strangling was a favourite method of averting  the wrath of the gods. The well-known instances of Jephthah's sacrifice  of his daughter and of David's giving up the seven sons of Saul to be  sacrificed by the Gibeonites \"before Jahveh,\" appear to me to leave no  doubt that the old Israelites, even when devout worshippers of Jahveh,  considered human sacrifices, under certain circumstances, to be not only  permissible but laudable. Samuel's hewing to pieces of the miserable  captive, sole survivor of his nation, Agag, \"before Jahveh,\" can hardly  be viewed in any other light. The life of Moses is redeemed from Jahveh,  who \"sought to slay him,\" by Zipporah's symbolical sacrifice of her  child, by the bloody operation of circumcision. Jahveh expressly affirms  that the first-born males of men and beasts are devoted to him; in  accordance with that claim, the first-born males of the beasts are duly  sacrificed; and it is only by special permission that the claim to the  first-born of men is waived, and it is enacted that they may be redeemed  (Exod. xiii. 12-15). Is it possible to avoid the conclusion that  immolation of their first-born sons would have been incumbent on the  worshippers of Jahveh, had they not been thus specially excused? Can any  other conclusion be drawn from the history of Abraham and Isaac?  Does Abraham exhibit any indication of surprise when he receives the  astounding order to sacrifice his son? Is there the slightest evidence  that there was anything in his intimate and personal acquaintance with  the character of the Deity, who had eaten the meat and drunk the milk  which Abraham set before him under the oaks of Mamre, to lead him to  hesitate--even to wait twelve or fourteen hours for a repetition of  the command? Not a whit. We are told that \"Abraham rose early in the  morning\" and led his only child to the slaughter, as if it were the  most ordinary business imaginable. Whether the story has any historical  foundation or not, it is valuable as showing that the writer of it  conceived Jahveh as a deity whose requirement of such a sacrifice need  excite neither astonishment nor suspicion of mistake on the part of his  devotee. Hence, when the incessant human sacrifices in Israel,  during the age of the kings, are put down to the influence of foreign  idolatries, we may fairly inquire whether editorial Bowdlerising has not  prevailed over historical truth.    An attempt to compare the ethical standards of two nations, one of which  has a written code, while the other has not, is beset with difficulties.  With all that is strange and, in many cases, repulsive to us in the  social arrangements and opinions respecting moral obligation among  the Tongans, as they are placed before us, with perfect candour, in  Mariner's account, there is much that indicates a strong ethical  sense. They showed great kindliness to one another, and faithfulness in  standing by their comrades in war. No people could have better observed  either the third or the fifth commandment; for they had a particular  horror of blasphemy, and their respectful tenderness towards their  parents and, indeed, towards old people in general, was remarkable.    It cannot be said that the eighth commandment was generally observed,  especially where Europeans were concerned; nevertheless a well-bred  Tongan looked upon theft as a meanness to which he would not condescend.  As to the seventh commandment, any breach of it was considered  scandalous in women and as something to be avoided in self-respecting  men; but, among unmarried and widowed people, chastity was held very  cheap. Nevertheless the women were extremely well treated, and often  showed themselves capable of great devotion and entire faithfulness. In  the matter of cruelty, treachery, and bloodthirstiness, these islanders  were neither better nor worse than most peoples of antiquity. It is to  the credit of the Tongans that they particularly objected to slander;  nor can covetousness be regarded as their characteristic; for Mariner  says:--       When any one is about to eat, he always shares out what he has     to those about him, without any hesitation, and a contrary     conduct would be considered exceedingly vile and selfish (vol.     ii p. 145).    In fact, they thought very badly of the English when Mariner told them  that his countrymen did not act exactly on that principle. It further  appears that they decidedly belonged to the school of intuitive moral  philosophers, and believed that virtue is its own reward; for       Many of the chiefs, on being asked by Mr. Mariner what motives     they had for conducting themselves with propriety, besides the     fear of misfortunes in this life, replied, the agreeable and     happy feeling which a man experiences within himself when he     does any good action or conducts himself nobly and generously as     a man ought to do; and this question they answered as if they     wondered such a question should be asked. (vol. ii. p. 161).    One may read from the beginning of the book of Judges to the end of the  books of Samuel without discovering that the old Israelites had a moral  standard which differs, in any essential respect (except perhaps in  regard to the chastity of unmarried women), from that of the Tongans.  Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, and David are strong-handed men, some of whom  are not outdone by any Polynesian chieftain in the matter of murder  and treachery; while Deborah's jubilation over Jael's violation of the  primary duty of hospitality, proffered and accepted under circumstances  which give a peculiarly atrocious character to the murder of the guest;  and her witch-like gloating over the picture of the disappointment of  the mother of the victim--       The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice,     Why is his chariot so long in coming? (Jud. v. 28.)  --would not have been out of place in the choral service of the most  sanguinary god in the Polynesian pantheon.    With respect to the cannibalism which the Tongans occasionally  practised, Mariner says:--       Although a few young ferocious warriors chose to imitate what     they considered a mark of courageous fierceness in a     neighbouring nation, it was held in disgust by everybody else     (vol. ii. p. 171).    That the moral standard of Tongan life was less elevated than that  indicated in the \"Book of the Covenant\" (Exod. xxi.-xxiii.) may be  freely admitted. But then the evidence that this Book of the Covenant,  and even the ten commandments as given in Exodus, were known to the  Israelites of the time of Samuel and Saul, is (to say the least) by no  means conclusive. The Deuteronomic version of the fourth commandment is  hopelessly discrepant from that which stands in Exodus. Would any later  writer have ventured to alter the commandments as given from Sinai, if  he had had before him that which professed to be an accurate statement  of the \"ten words\" in Exodus? And if the writer of Deuteronomy had not  Exodus before him, what is the value of the claim of the version of the  ten commandments therein contained to authenticity? From one end to  the other of the books of Judges and Samuel, the only \"commandments  of Jahveh\" which are specially adduced refer to the prohibition of the  worship of other gods, or are orders given _ad hoc,_ and have nothing to  do with questions of morality.    In Polynesia, the belief in witchcraft, in the appearance of spiritual  beings in dreams, in possession as the cause of diseases, and in omens,  prevailed universally. Mariner tells a story of a woman of rank who was  greatly attached to King Finow, and who, for the space of six months  after his death, scarcely ever slept elsewhere than on his grave, which  she kept carefully decorated with flowers:--    \"One day she went, with the deepest affliction, to the house of Mo-oonga  Toobo, the widow of the deceased chief, to communicate what had happened  to her at the _fytoca_ [grave] during several nights, and which caused  her the greatest anxiety. She related that she had dreamed that the  late How [King] appeared to her and, with a countenance full of  disappointment, asked why there yet remained at Vavaoo so many  evil-designing persons; for he declared that, since he had been at  Bolotoo, his spirit had been disturbed [22] by the evil machinations of  wicked men conspiring against his son; but he declared that 'the youth'  should not be molested nor his power shaken by the spirit of rebellion;  that he therefore came to her with a warning voice to prevent such  disastrous consequences (vol. i. p. 424).\"    On inquiry it turned out that the charm of _tattao_ had been performed  on Finow's grave, with the view of injuring his son, the reigning king,  and it is to be presumed that it was this sorcerer's work which had  \"disturbed\" Finow's spirit. The Rev. Richard Taylor says in the work  already cited: \"The account given of the witch of Endor agrees most  remarkably with the witches of New Zealand\" (p. 45).
