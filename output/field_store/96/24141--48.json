Joel can hand him his medicine.\"    \"Oh, Joe would tumble to sleep, mammy,\" said Polly, \"the first  thing--let me.\"    \"Perhaps Phronsie'll let me go to-night,\" said Mrs. Pepper,  reflectively.    \"Oh, no she won't, I know,\" replied Polly, decisively; \"she wants you  all the time.\"    \"I will, Polly,\" said Davie, coming in with an armful of wood, in time  to hear the conversation. \"I'll give him his medicine, mayn't I, mammy?\"  and David let down his load, and came over where his mother and Polly  sat sewing, to urge his rights.    \"I don't know,\" said his mother, smiling on him. \"Can you, do you  think?\"    \"Yes, ma'am!\" said Davie, straightening himself up.    When they told Ben, he said he knew a better way than for Davie to  watch; he'd have a string tied to Davie's arm, and the end he'd hold in  bed, and when 'twas time for medicine, he'd pull the string, and that  would wake Davie up!    Polly didn't sleep much more on her shake-down on the floor than if she  had watched with Ben; for Phronsie cried and moaned, and wanted a drink  of water every two minutes, it seemed to her. As she went back into her  nest after one of these travels, Polly thought: \"Well, I don't care, if  nobody else gets sick; if Ben'll only get well. To-morrow I'm goin' to  do mammy's sack she's begun for Mr. Jackson; it's all plain sew-in',  just like a bag; and I can do it, I know--\" and so she fell into a  troubled sleep, only to be awakened by Phronsie's fretful little voice:  \"I want a drink of water, Polly, I do.\"    \"Don't she drink awfully, mammy?\" asked Polly, after one of these  excursions out to the kitchen after the necessary draught.    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"and she mustn't have any more; 'twill hurt  her.\" But Phronsie fell into a delicious sleep after that, and didn't  want any more, luckily.    \"Here, Joe,\" said Mrs. Pepper, the next morning, \"take this coat up to  Mr. Peterses; and be sure you get the money for it.\"    \"How'll I get it?\" asked Joe, who didn't relish the long, hot walk.    \"Why, tell 'em we're sick--Ben's sick,\" added Mrs. Pepper, as the most  decisive thing; \"and we must have it; and then wait for it.\"    \"Tisn't pleasant up at the Peterses,\" grumbled Joel, taking the parcel  and moving slowly off.    \"No, no, Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"you needn't do that,\" seeing  Polly take up some sewing after doing up the room and finishing the  semi-weekly bake; \"you're all beat out with that tussle over the stove;  that sack'll have to go till next week.\"    \"It can't, mammy,\" said Polly, snipping off a basting thread; \"we've got  to have the money; how much'll he give you for it?\"    \"Thirty cents,\" replied Mrs. Pepper.    \"Well,\" said Polly, \"we've got to get all the thirty centses we can,  mammy dear; and I know I can do it, truly--try me once,\" she implored.    \"Well.\" Mrs. Pepper relented, slowly.    \"Don't feel bad, mammy dear,\" comforted Polly, sewing away briskly;  \"Ben'll get well pretty soon, and then we'll be all right.\"    \"Maybe,\" said Mrs. Pepper; and went back to Phronsie, who could scarcely  let her out of her sight.    Polly stitched away bravely. \"Now if I do this good, mammy'll let me do  it other times,\" she said to herself.    Davie, too, worked patiently out of doors, trying to do Ben's chores.  The little fellow blundered over things that Ben would have accomplished  in half the time, and he had to sit down often on the steps of the  little old shed where the tools were kept, to wipe his hot face and  rest.    \"Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"hadn't you better stop a little? Dear me!  how fast you sew, child!\"    Polly gave a delighted little hum at her mother's evident approval.    \"I'm going to do 'em all next week, mammy,\" she said; \"then Mr. Atkins  won't take 'em away from us, I guess.\"    Mr. Atkins kept the store, and gave out coats and sacks of coarse linen  and homespun to Mrs. Pepper to make; and it was the fear of losing the  work that had made the mother's heart sink.    \"I don't believe anybody's got such children as I have,\" she said; and  she gave Polly a motherly little pat that the little daughter felt clear  to the tips of her toes with a thrill of delight.    About half-past two, long after dinner, Joe came walking in, hungry as a  beaver, but flushed and triumphant.    \"Why, where have you been all this time?\" asked his mother.    \"Oh, Joe, you didn't stop to play?\" asked Polly, from her perch where  she sat sewing, giving him a reproachful glance.    \"Stop to play!\" retorted Joe, indignantly; \"no, I guess I didn't! I've  been to Old Peterses.\"    \"Not all this time!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pepper.    \"Yes, I have too,\" replied Joel, sturdily marching up to her. \"And  there's your money, mother;\" and he counted out a quarter of a dollar  in silver pieces and pennies, which he took from a dingy wad of paper,  stowed away in the depths of his pocket.    \"Oh, Joe,\" said Mrs. Pepper, sinking back in her chair and looking at  him; \"what do you mean?\"    Polly put her work in her lap, and waited to hear.    \"Where's my dinner, Polly?\" asked Joel; \"I hope it's a big one.    \"Yes, 'tis,\" said Polly; \"you've got lots to-day, it's in the corner of  the cupboard, covered up with the plate--so tell on, Joe.\"    \"That's elegant!\" said Joel, coming back with the well-filled plate,  Ben's and his own share.    \"Do tell us, Joey,\" implored Polly; \"mother's waiting.\"    \"Well,\" said Joel, his mouth half full, \"I waited--and he said the coat  was all right;--and--and--Mrs. Peters said 'twas all right;--and Mirandy  Peters said 'twas all right; but they didn't any of 'em say anythin'  about payin', so I didn't think 'twas all right--and--and--can't I have  some more butter, Polly?\"    \"No,\" said Polly, sorry to refuse him, he'd been so good about the  money; \"the butter's got to be saved for Ben and Phronsie.\"    \"Oh,\" said Joe, \"I wish Miss Henderson would send us some more, I do! I  think she might!\"    \"For shame, Joe,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"she was very good to send this, I  think; now what else did you say?\" she asked.    \"Well,\" said Joel, taking another mouthful of bread, \"so I waited; you  told me to, mother, you know--and they all went to work; and they didn't  mind me at all, and--there wasn't anything to look at, so I sat--and  sat--Polly, can't I have some gingerbread?\"    \"No,\" said Polly, \"it's all gone; I gave the last piece to Phronsie the  day she was taken sick.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Joel, \"everything's gone.\"    \"Well, do go on, Joe, do.\"    \"And--then they had dinner; and Mr. Peters said, 'Hasn't that boy gone  home yet?' and Mrs. Peters said, 'no'--and he called me in, and asked me  why I didn't run along home; and I said, Phronsie was sick, and Ben had  the squeezles--\"    \"The what?\" said Polly.    \"The squeezles,\" repeated Joel, irritably; \"that's what you said.\"    \"It's measles, Joey,\" corrected Mrs. Pepper; \"never mind, I wouldn't  feel bad.\"    \"Well, they all laughed, and laughed, and then I said you told me to  wait till I did get the money.\"    \"Oh, Joe,\" began Mrs. Pepper, \"you shouldn't have told 'em so--what did  he say?\"    \"Well, he laughed, and said I was a smart boy, and he'd see; and Mirandy  said, 'do pay him, pa, he must be tired to death'--and don't you think,  he went to a big desk in the corner, and took out a box, and 'twas full  most of money--lots! oh! and he gave me mine--and--that's all; and I'm  tired to death.\" And Joel flung himself down on the floor, expanded his  legs as only Joel could, and took a comfortable roll.    \"So you must be,\" said Polly, pityingly, \"waiting at those Peterses.\"    \"Don't ever want to see any more Peterses,\" said Joel; never, never,  never!    \"Oh, dear,\" thought Polly, as she sewed on into the afternoon, \"I wonder  what does all my eyes! feels just like sand in 'em;\" and she rubbed and  rubbed to thread her needle. But she was afraid her mother would see,  so she kept at her sewing. Once in awhile the bad feeling would go away,  and then she would forget all about it. \"There now, who says I can't do  it! that's most done,\" she cried, jumping up, and spinning across the  room, to stretch herself a bit, \"and to-morrow I'll finish it.\"    \"Well,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"if you can do that, Polly, you'll be the  greatest help I've had yet.\"    So Polly tucked herself into the old shake-down with a thankful heart  that night, hoping for morning.    Alas! when morning did come, Polly could hardly move. The measles! what  should she do! A faint hope of driving them off made her tumble out  of bed, and stagger across the room to look in the old cracked  looking-glass. All hope was gone as the red reflection met her gaze.  Polly was on the sick list now!    \"I won't be sick,\" she said; \"at any rate, I'll keep around.\" An awful  feeling made her clutch the back of a chair, but she managed somehow to  get into her clothes, and go groping blindly into the kitchen. Somehow,  Polly couldn't see very well. She tried to set the table, but 'twas no  use. \"Oh, dear,\" she thought, \"whatever'll mammy do?\"    \"Hulloa!\" said Joel, coming in, \"what's the matter, Polly?\" Polly  started at his sudden entrance, and, wavering a minute, fell over in a  heap.    \"Oh ma! ma!\" screamed Joel, running to the foot of the stairs leading to  the loft, where Mrs. Pepper was with Ben; \"something's taken Polly! and  she fell; and I guess she's in the wood-box!\"          HARD DAYS FOR POLLY      \"Ma,\" said David, coming softly into the bedroom, where poor Polly  lay on the bed with Phronsie, her eyes bandaged with a soft old  handkerchief, \"I'll set the table.\"    \"There isn't any table to set,\" said Mrs. Pepper, sadly; \"there isn't  anybody to eat anything, Davie; you and Joel can get something out of  the cupboard.\"    \"Can we get whatever we've a mind to, ma?\" cried Joel, who followed  Davie, rubbing his face with a towel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#8)"],[1,"  from one end of the filter tube and rapidly couple them up by means of  the sterile rubber tubing.    6. Connect the other end of the bulb tube with the delivery tube from  the gas reservoir.    The gas in its passage through the dry sterile cotton-wool in the bulb  of the filter tube will be freed from any contained micro-organisms and  will enter the flask in a sterile condition.    (b) _Porcelain Filter._--The sterilisation of liquids by filtration is  effected by passing them through a cylindrical vessel, closed at one end  like a test-tube, and made either of porous \"biscuit\" porcelain,  hard-burnt and unglazed (Chamberland system), or of Kieselguhr, a fine  diatomaceous earth (Berkefeld system), and termed a \"bougie\" or \"candle\"  (Fig. 34).         NOTE.--In selecting candles for use in the laboratory avoid       those with metal fittings, since during sterilisation cracks       develop at the junction of the metal and the siliceous       material owing to the unequal expansion.    In this method the bacteria are retained in the pores of the filter  while the liquid passes through in a germ-free condition.    It is obvious that to be effective the pores of the filter must be  extremely minute, and therefore the rate of filtration will usually be  slow. Chamberland filter candles possess finer channels than Berkefeld  candles and consequently filter much more slowly. To overcome this  disadvantage, either aspiration or pressure, or a combination of these  two forces, may be employed to hasten the process.    Doultons white porcelain filters it may be noted are as efficient as the  Chamberland candles and filter rather more rapidly.    _Apparatus Required._--    1. Separatory funnel containing the unfiltered fluid.    2. Sterile filter candle (Fig. 34), the open end fitted with a rubber  stopper (Fig. 34, a) perforated to receive the delivery tube of the  separatory funnel, and its neck passed through a large rubber washer  (Fig. 34, b) which fits the mouth of the filter flask.    3. Sterile filter flask of suitable size, for the reception of the  filtered fluid, its mouth closed by a cotton-wool plug.    4. Water injector Sprengel (see Fig. 38, c) pump, or Geryk's pump (an  air pump on the hydraulic principle, sealed by means of low  vapor-tension oil, Fig. 35).    If this latter is employed, a Wulff's bottle, fitted as a wash-bottle  and containing sulphuric acid, must be interposed between the filter  flask and the pump, in order to prevent moist air reaching the oil in  the pump.    5. Air filter (_vide_ page 40) sterilised.    6. Pressure tubing.    7. Screw clamps (Fig. 36).    METHOD.--    1. Couple the exhaust pipe of the suction pump with the lateral tube of  the filter flask (first removing the cotton-wool plug from this latter),  by means of pressure tubing, interposing, if necessary, the wash-bottle  of sulphuric acid.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Porcelain filter candle.]    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Geryk air pump.]    2. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the neck of the filter flask and  adjust the porcelain candle in its place.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Screw clamps.]    3. Attach the nozzle of the separatory funnel to the filter candle by  means of the perforated rubber stopper (Fig. 37).    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Apparatus arranged for filtering--aspiration.]    4. Open the tap of the funnel, and exhaust the air from the filter flask  and wash-bottle; maintain the vacuum until the filtration is complete.    5. When the filtration is completed close the tap of the funnel; adjust  a screw clamp to the pressure tubing attached to the lateral branch of  the filter flask; screw it up tightly, and disconnect the acid  wash-bottle.    6. Attach the air filter to the open end of the pressure tubing; open  the screw clamp gradually, and allow filtered air to enter the flask, to  abolish the negative pressure.    7. Detach the rubber tubing from the lateral branch of the flask, flame  the end of the branch in the Bunsen, and plug its orifice with sterile  cotton-wool.    8. Remove the filter candle from the mouth of the flask, flame the  mouth, and plug the neck with sterile cotton-wool.    9. Disinfect the filter candle and separatory funnel by boiling.    If it is found necessary to employ pressure in addition to or in place  of suction, insert a perforated rubber stopper into the mouth of the  separatory funnel and secure in position with copper wire; next fit a  piece of glass tubing through the stopper, and connect the external  orifice with an air-pressure pump of some kind (an ordinary foot pump  such as is employed for inflating bicycle tyres is one of the most  generally useful, for this purpose) or with a cylinder of compressed air  or other gas.    In order to filter a large bulk of fluid very rapidly it is necessary to  use a higher pressure than glass would stand, and in these cases the  metal receptacle designed by Pakes (Fig. 38, a), to hold the filter  candle itself as well as the fluid to be filtered, should be employed.  (A vacuum must also be maintained in the filter flask, by means of an  exhaust pump, during the entire process.)    This piece of apparatus consists of a brass cylinder, capacity 2500  c.c., with two shoulders; and an opening in the neck at each end,  provided with screw threads.    A nut carrying a pressure gauge fits into the top screw; and into the  bottom is fitted a brass cylinder carrying the filter candle and  prolonged downwards into a delivery tube. Leakage is prevented by means  of rubber washers.    Into the top shoulder a tube is inserted, bent at right angles and  provided with a tap. All the brass-work is tinned inside (Fig. 38, a).  In use the reservoir is generally mounted on a tripod stand.    ~To Sterilise.~--    1. Insert the filter candle into its cylinder and screw this loosely on.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Pakes' filtering reservoir--pressure and  aspiration.]    2. Wrap a layer of cotton-wool around the delivery tube and fasten in  position.    3. Remove the nut carrying the pressure gauge and plug the neck with  cotton-wool.    4. Heat the whole apparatus in the autoclave at 120 deg. C. for twenty  minutes.    METHOD.--    1. Remove the apparatus from the autoclave, and allow it to cool.    2. Screw home the box carrying the bougie.    3. Set the apparatus up in position, with its delivery tube (from which  the cotton-wool wrapping has been removed) passing through a perforated  rubber stopper in the neck of a filter flask.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Closed candle arranged for filtering.]    4. Fill the fluid to be filtered into the cylinder and screw on the nut  carrying the pressure gauge. (This nut should be immersed in boiling  water for a few minutes previous to screwing on, in order to sterilise  it.)    5. Connect the horizontal arm of the entry tube with a cylinder of  compressed oxygen (or carbon dioxide, Fig. 38, b), by means of  pressure tubing.    6. Connect the lateral arm of the filter flask with the exhaust pump  (Fig. 38, c) and start the latter working.    7. Open the tap of the gas cylinder; then open the tap on the entry tube  of the filter cylinder and raise the pressure in its interior until the  desired point is recorded on the manometer. Maintain this pressure,  usually one or one and a half atmospheres, until filtration is  completed, by regulating the tap on the entry tube.    Some forms of filter candle are made with the open end contracted into a  delivery nozzle, which is glazed. In this case the apparatus is fitted  up in a slightly different manner; the fluid to be filtered is contained  in an open cylinder into which the candle is plunged, while its delivery  nozzle is connected with the filter flask by means of a piece of  flexible pressure tubing (previously sterilised by boiling), as in  figure 39.          IV. THE MICROSCOPE.      The essentials of a microscope for bacteriological work may be briefly  summed up as follows:    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Microscope stand.]    The instrument, of the monocular type, must be of good workmanship and  well finished, rigid, firm, and free from vibration, not only when  upright, but also when inclined to an angle or in the horizontal  position. The various joints and movements must work smoothly and  precisely, equally free from the defects of \"loss of time\" and  \"slipping.\" All screws, etc., should conform to the Royal Microscopical  Society's standard. It must also be provided with good lenses and a  sufficiently large stage. The details of its component parts, to which  attention must be specially directed, are as follows:    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Foot, three types.]    ~1. The Base or Foot~ (Fig. 40, a).--Two elementary forms--the tripod  (Fig. 41, a) and the vertical column set into a plate known as the  \"horse-shoe\" (Fig. 41, b)--serve as the patterns for countless  modifications in shape and size of this portion of the stand. The chief  desiderata--stability and ease of manipulation--are attained in the  first by means of the \"spread\" of the three feet, which are usually shod  with cork; in the second, by the dead weight of the foot-plate. The  tripod is mechanically the more correct form, and for practical use is  much to be preferred. Its chief rival, the Jackson foot (Fig. 41, c),  is based upon the same principle, and on the score of appearance has  much to recommend it.    ~2.~ The ~body tube~ (Fig. 40, b) may be either that known as the \"long\"  or \"English\" (length 250 mm.), or the \"short\" or \"Continental\" (length  160 mm.). Neither length appears to possess any material advantage over  the other, but it is absolutely necessary to secure objectives which  have been manufactured for the particular tube length chosen. In the  high-class microscope of the present day the body tube is usually  shorter than the Continental, but is provided with a draw tube which,  when fully extended, gives a tube length greater than the English, thus  permitting"]]]
