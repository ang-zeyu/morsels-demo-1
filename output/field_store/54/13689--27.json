Among much reading of my earlier days, it is no doubt true that I  travelled a good deal in the twilight regions of superstitious  disquisitions. Many hours have I lost--\"I would their debt were  less!\"--in examining old as well as more recent narratives of this  character, and even in looking into some of the criminal trials so  frequent in early days, upon a subject which our fathers considered as a  matter of the last importance. And, of late years, the very curious  extracts published by Mr. Pitcairn, from the Criminal Records of  Scotland, are, besides their historical value, of a nature so much  calculated to illustrate the credulity of our ancestors on such  subjects, that, by perusing them, I have been induced more recently to  recall what I had read and thought upon the subject at a former period.    As, however, my information is only miscellaneous, and I make no  pretensions, either to combat the systems of those by whom I am  anticipated in consideration of the subject, or to erect any new one of  my own, my purpose is, after a general account of Demonology and  Witchcraft, to confine myself to narratives of remarkable cases, and to  the observations which naturally and easily arise out of them;--in the  confidence that such a plan is, at the present time of day, more likely  to suit the pages of a popular miscellany, than an attempt to reduce the  contents of many hundred tomes, from the largest to the smallest size,  into an abridgement, which, however compressed, must remain greatly too  large for the reader's powers of patience.    A few general remarks on the nature of Demonology, and the original  cause of the almost universal belief in communication betwixt mortals  and beings of a power superior to themselves, and of a nature not to be  comprehended by human organs, are a necessary introduction to the  subject.    The general, or, it may be termed, the universal belief of the  inhabitants of the earth, in the existence of spirits separated from the  encumbrance and incapacities of the body, is grounded on the  consciousness of the divinity that speaks in our bosoms, and  demonstrates to all men, except the few who are hardened to the  celestial voice, that there is within us a portion of the divine  substance, which is not subject to the law of death and dissolution, but  which, when the body is no longer fit for its abode, shall seek its own  place, as a sentinel dismissed from his post. Unaided by revelation, it  cannot be hoped that mere earthly reason should be able to form any  rational or precise conjecture concerning the destination of the soul  when parted from the body; but the conviction that such an  indestructible essence exists, the belief expressed by the poet in a  different sense, _Non omnis moriar_ must infer the existence of many  millions of spirits who have not been annihilated, though they have  become invisible to mortals who still see, hear, and perceive, only by  means of the imperfect organs of humanity. Probability may lead some of  the most reflecting to anticipate a state of future rewards and  punishments; as those experienced in the education of the deaf and dumb  find that their pupils, even while cut off from all instruction by  ordinary means, have been able to form, out of their own unassisted  conjectures, some ideas of the existence of a Deity, and of the  distinction between the soul and body--a circumstance which proves how  naturally these truths arise in the human mind. The principle that they  do so arise, being taught or communicated, leads to further conclusions.    These spirits, in a state of separate existence, being admitted to  exist, are not, it may be supposed, indifferent to the affairs of  mortality, perhaps not incapable of influencing them. It is true that,  in a more advanced state of society, the philosopher may challenge the  possibility of a separate appearance of a disembodied spirit, unless in  the case of a direct miracle, to which, being a suspension of the laws  of nature, directly wrought by the Maker of these laws, for some express  purpose, no bound or restraint can possibly be assigned. But under this  necessary limitation and exception, philosophers might plausibly argue  that, when the soul is divorced from the body, it loses all those  qualities which made it, when clothed with a mortal shape, obvious to  the organs of its fellow-men. The abstract idea of a spirit certainly  implies that it has neither substance, form, shape, voice, or anything  which can render its presence visible or sensible to human faculties.  But these sceptic doubts of philosophers on the possibility of the  appearance of such separated spirits, do not arise till a certain degree  of information has dawned upon a country, and even then only reach a  very small proportion of reflecting and better-informed members of  society. To the multitude, the indubitable fact, that so many millions  of spirits exist around and even amongst us, seems sufficient to support  the belief that they are, in certain instances at least, by some means  or other, able to communicate with the world of humanity. The more  numerous part of mankind cannot form in their mind the idea of the  spirit of the deceased existing, without possessing or having the power  to assume the appearance which their acquaintance bore during his life,  and do not push their researches beyond this point.    Enthusiastic feelings of an impressive and solemn nature occur both in  private and public life, which seem to add ocular testimony to an  intercourse betwixt earth and the world beyond it. For example, the son  who has been lately deprived of his father feels a sudden crisis  approach, in which he is anxious to have recourse to his sagacious  advice--or a bereaved husband earnestly desires again to behold the form  of which the grave has deprived him for ever--or, to use a darker yet  very common instance, the wretched man who has dipped his hand in his  fellow-creature's blood, is haunted by the apprehension that the phantom  of the slain stands by the bedside of his murderer. In all or any of  these cases, who shall doubt that imagination, favoured by  circumstances, has power to summon up to the organ of sight, spectres  which only exist in the mind of those by whom their apparition seems to  be witnessed?    If we add, that such a vision may take place in the course of one of  those lively dreams in which the patient, except in respect to the  single subject of one strong impression, is, or seems, sensible of the  real particulars of the scene around him, a state of slumber which often  occurs; if he is so far conscious, for example, as to know that he is  lying on his own bed, and surrounded by his own familiar furniture at  the time when the supposed apparition is manifested, it becomes almost  in vain to argue with the visionary against the reality of his dream,  since the spectre, though itself purely fanciful, is inserted amidst so  many circumstances which he feels must be true beyond the reach of doubt  or question. That which is undeniably certain becomes, in a manner, a  warrant for the reality of the appearance to which doubt would have been  otherwise attached. And if any event, such as the death of the person  dreamt of, chances to take place, so as to correspond with the nature  and the time of the apparition, the coincidence, though one which must  be frequent, since our dreams usually refer to the accomplishment of  that which haunts our minds when awake, and often presage the most  probable events, seems perfect, and the chain of circumstances touching  the evidence may not unreasonably be considered as complete. Such a  concatenation, we repeat, must frequently take place, when it is  considered of what stuff dreams are made--how naturally they turn upon  those who occupy our mind while awake, and, when a soldier is exposed to  death in battle, when a sailor is incurring the dangers of the sea, when  a beloved wife or relative is attacked by disease, how readily our  sleeping imagination rushes to the very point of alarm, which when  waking it had shuddered to anticipate. The number of instances in which  such lively dreams have been quoted, and both asserted and received as  spiritual communications, is very great at all periods; in ignorant  times, where the natural cause of dreaming is misapprehended and  confused with an idea of mysticism, it is much greater. Yet, perhaps,  considering the many thousands of dreams which must, night after night,  pass through the imagination of individuals, the number of coincidences  between the vision and real event are fewer and less remarkable than a  fair calculation of chances would warrant us to expect. But in countries  where such presaging dreams are subjects of attention, the number of  those which seemed to be coupled with the corresponding issue, is large  enough to spread a very general belief of a positive communication  betwixt the living and the dead.    Somnambulism and other nocturnal deceptions frequently lend their aid to  the formation of such _phantasmata_ as are formed in this middle state,  betwixt sleeping and waking. A most respectable person, whose active  life had been spent as master and part owner of a large merchant vessel  in the Lisbon trade, gave the writer an account of such an instance  which came under his observation. He was lying in the Tagus, when he was  put to great anxiety and alarm by the following incident and its  consequences. One of his crew was murdered by a Portuguese assassin, and  a report arose that the ghost of the slain man haunted the vessel.  Sailors are generally superstitious, and those of my friend's vessel  became unwilling to remain on board the ship; and it was probable they  might desert rather then return to England with the ghost for a  passenger. To prevent so great a calamity, the captain determined to  examine "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#2)"],[1," a mining expert, associated with  Mr. Bailey in Lydenburg, but his heart evidently lay in fighting and in  pursuing the different kinds of wild animals that make their home on the  African veldt. Dr. Rutherford Harris, then the Secretary of the  Chartered Company; Mr. Henry Milner, an old friend; Mr. Geoffrey Glyn  and Mr. F. Guest, are others whom I specially remember; besides many  more, some of whom have joined the vast majority, and others whom I have  altogether lost sight of, but who helped to make the voyage a very  pleasant one.    We landed at Cape Town shortly before Christmas Day. As I have since  learnt by the experience of many voyages, it is nearly always at dawn  that a liner is brought alongside the quay at the conclusion of a long  voyage; in consequence, sleep is almost out of the question the last  night at sea, owing to the noisy manipulations of the mail-bags and  luggage. However, one is always so glad to get on shore that it is of  very little import, and on this occasion we were all anxious to glean  the latest news after being cut off from the world for so many days. The  papers contained gloomy accounts of the markets. \"King Slump\" still held  his sway, and things abroad looked very unsettled; so most of our  friends appeared, when we met later, with very long faces. After  breakfast, leaving our luggage to the tender mercies of some officious  agent, who professed to see it \"through the Customs,\" we took a hansom  and drove to the Grand Hotel, _en route_ to the hotel, in the suburb of  Newlands, where we had taken rooms. My first impressions of Cape Town  certainly were not prepossessing, and well I remember them, even after  all these years. The dust was blowing in clouds, stirred up by the  \"south-easter\" one hears so much about--an icy blast which appears to  come straight from the South Pole, and which often makes its appearance  in the height of summer, which season it then was. The hansom, of the  oldest-fashioned type, shook and jolted beyond belief, and threatened  every moment to fall to pieces. The streets from the docks to the town  were unfinished, untidy, and vilely paved, and I remember comparing them  very unfavourably with Melbourne or Sydney. However, I soon modified my  somewhat hasty judgment. We had seen the town's worst aspects, and later  I noticed some attractive-looking shops; the imposing Houses of  Parliament, in their enclosed grounds, standing out sharply defined  against the hazy background of Table Mountain; and the Standard Bank and  Railway-station, which would hold their own in any city. At the same  time, as a place of residence in the summer months, I can well  understand Cape Town being wellnigh deserted. Those who can boast of  even the most moderate means have their residences in the attractive  suburbs of Rondebosch, Newlands, or Wynberg, and innumerable are the  pretty little villas and gardens one sees in these vicinities. There the  country is beautifully wooded, thick arching avenues of oak extending  for miles, interspersed with tracts of Scotch firs and pines, the latter  exhaling a delicious perfume under the sun's powerful rays. Everywhere  green foliage and abundant vegetation, which, combined with the setting  of the bluest sky that can be imagined, make the drives round Cape Town  some of the most beautiful in the world. At Newlands, the Governor's  summer residence, a pretty but unpretentious abode, Sir Hercules and  Lady Robinson then dispensed generous hospitality, only regretting their  house was too small to accommodate visitors, besides their married  daughters. We stayed at the Vineyard Hotel in the immediate  neighbourhood--a funny old-fashioned hostelry, standing in its own  grounds, and not in the least like an hotel as we understand the word.  There whole families seemed to reside for months, and very comfortable  it was, if somewhat primitive, appearing to keep itself far apart from  the rush of modern improvements, and allowing the world to go by it  unheeded. Only half a mile away, at Rondebosch, was situated then, as  now, on the lower slopes of Table Mountain, the princely domain of the  late Mr. Cecil Rhodes. At the moment of which I write the house itself  was only approaching completion, and I must now record a few  particulars of our introduction to this great Englishman and his  world-famed home. We drove to Groot Schuurr, or \"Great Barn,\" one  afternoon with Mr. Beit. The house is approached by a long avenue of  enormously high Scotch firs, which almost meet aloft, and remind one of  the nave of some mighty cathedral, such is the subdued effect produced  by the sunlight even on the brightest summer day. A slight rise in the  road, a serpentine sweep, and the house itself comes into view, white,  low, and rambling, with many gables and a thatched roof. The right wing  was then hidden by scaffolding, and workmen were also busy putting in a  new front-door, of which more anon; for a tall, burly gentleman in a  homely costume of flannels and a slouch hat emerged from the unfinished  room, where he would seem to have been directing the workmen, and we  were introduced to Cecil John Rhodes, the Prime Minister of Cape Colony.    I looked at the man, of whom I had heard so much, with a great deal of  curiosity. Shy and diffident with strangers, his manner even somewhat  abrupt, one could not fail to be impressed with the expression of power,  resolution, and kindness, on the rugged countenance, and with the keen,  piercing glance of the blue eyes, which seemed to read one through in an  instant. He greeted us, as he did every newcomer, most warmly, and  under his guidance we passed into the completed portion of the house,  the rooms of which were not only most comfortable, but also perfect in  every detail as regards the model he wished to copy--viz., a Dutch house  of 200 years ago, even down to the massive door aforementioned, which he  had just purchased for L200 from a colonial family mansion, and which  seemed to afford him immense pleasure. As a first fleeting memory of the  interior of Groot Schuurr, I call to mind Dutch armoires, all  incontestably old and of lovely designs, Dutch chests, inlaid  high-backed chairs, costly Oriental rugs, and everywhere teak  panelling--the whole producing a vision of perfect taste and old-world  repose. It was then Mr. Rhodes's intention to have no electric light, or  even lamps, and burn nothing but tallow candles, so as to keep up the  illusion of antiquity; but whether he would have adhered to this  determination it is impossible to say, as the house we saw was burnt to  the ground later on, and is now rebuilt on exactly the same lines, but  with electric light, every modern comfort, and lovely old red tiles to  replace the quaint thatched roof.    Passing through the rooms, we came to the wide verandah, or stoep, on  the other or eastern side. This ran the whole length of the edifice, and  was used as a delightful lounge, being provided with luxurious settees  and armchairs. From here Mr. Rhodes pointed out the view he loved so  well, and which comes vividly to my mind to-day. In front three terraces  rise immediately beyond the gravel courtyard, which is enclosed on three  sides by the stoep. These, bright with flowers, lead to a great grass  plateau, on which some more splendid specimens of Scotch firs rear their  lofty heads; while behind, covered with trees and vegetation, its  brilliant green veiled by misty heat, Table Mountain forms a glorious  background, in striking contrast to the cobalt of the heavens. To the  right of the terraces is a glade, entirely covered with vivid blue  hydrangeas in full bloom, giving the appearance of a tract of azure  ground. Lower down the hillside, in little valleys, amidst oak and other  English forest trees, a carpet is formed of cannas of many hues,  interspersed with masses of gleaming white arum lilies, which grow here  wild in very great profusion.    Our time was too short on this occasion to see any portion of Mr.  Rhodes's estate or the animals--antelope of many kinds, wildebeestes,  elands, and zebras--which roamed through his woods. We lunched with him  two days later on Christmas Eve, and then the weather was so hot that we  only lazily enjoyed the shade and breezes on the stoep. Well do I  remember on that occasion how preoccupied was our host, and how  incessantly the talk turned to Johannesburg and the raging discontent  there. In truth, Mr. Rhodes's position was then a very difficult one: he  was Prime Minister of Cape Colony, and therefore officially neutral; but  in his heart he remained the keen champion of the oppressed Uitlanders,  having nominated his brother, Frank Rhodes, to be one of the leaders of  the Reform Committee at Johannesburg. No wonder he was graver than was  his wont, with many complications overshadowing him, as one afterwards  so fully realized. His kindness as a host, however, suffered no  diminution, and I remember how warmly he pressed us to stay with him  when we returned from the north, though he did add, \"My plans are a  little unsettled.\" This suggested visit, however, was never paid; Mr.  Rhodes a few weeks afterwards was starting for England, to, as he termed  it, \"face the music.\" I shall have occasion to describe him in his home,  and the life at Groot Schuurr, more fully later on, when I passed many  happy and never-to-be-forgotten weeks beneath his hospitable roof. As  years went on, his kindness to both friends and political foes grew  almost proverbial, but even in 1895 Groot Schuurr, barely finished, was  already known to be one of the pleasantest places near Cape Town--a  meeting-place for all the men of the colony either on their way to and  from England, or on the occasion of their flying visits to the capital.
