While you are  in health and strength, labour to do good, and avoid evil, if ever you  wish to escape the distress that oppresses me.\"    When Lord Lyttleton was on his death-bed, his daughter, Lady Valentia,  and her husband, came to see him. He gave them his solemn benediction,  adding--\"Be good, be virtuous, my lord; you must come to this.\"    The triumphant death of Addison will be remembered with feelings of  pleasure by all. Having sent for the young Earl of Warwick, he  affectionately pressed his hand, saying--\"See in what peace a Christian  can die!\"    The father of William Penn was opposed to his son's religious  principles; but finding that he acted with sincerity, was at last  reconciled. When dying, he adjured him to do nothing contrary to his  conscience--\"So,\" said he, \"you will keep peace within, which will be a  comfort in the day of trouble.\"    Locke, the day before his death, addressed Lady Masham, who was sitting  by his bedside, exhorting her to regard this world only as a state of  preparation for a better. He added, that he had lived long enough, and  expressed his gratitude to God for the happiness that had fallen to his  lot.    Tillotson, when dying, thanked his Maker that he felt his conscience at  ease, and that he had nothing further to do but to await the will of  Heaven.    Sir Walter Raleigh behaved on the scaffold with the greatest composure.  Having vindicated his conduct in an eloquent speech, he felt the edge of  the axe, observing with a smile--\"It is a sharp medicine, but a sure  remedy, for all woes.\" Being asked which way he would lay himself on the  block, he replied--\"So the heart be right, it is no matter which way the  head lies.\"    Latimer, when he beheld a fagot ready kindled laid at Ridley's feet,  exclaimed--\"Be of good cheer, master Ridley, and play the man; we shall  this day light such a candle in England, as I hope, by God's grace,  shall never be put out.\"    The author of Hervey's Meditations, when on his sick bed, observed that  his time had been too much occupied in reading the historians, orators,  and poets of ancient and modern times; and that were he to renew his  studies, he would devote his attention to the Scriptures.    The last words which the eminent physician Haller addressed to his  medical attendant expressed the calm serenity of his mind. \"My friend,\"  said he, laying his hand on his pulse, \"the artery no longer beats.\"    M. De La Harpe, one of the first literary characters of the last  century, who for many years laboured to spread the principles of the  French philosophy, but afterwards became a most strenuous defender of  Christianity, on the evening preceding his death was visited by a  friend. He was listening to the Prayers for the Sick; as soon as they  were concluded, he stretched forth his hand and said--\"I am grateful to  Divine mercy, for having left me sufficient recollection to feel how  consoling these prayers are to the dying.\"    Cardinal Wolsey, when dying, by slow progress and short journeys,  reached Leicester Abbey. He was received with the greatest respect. His  only observation was, \"Father Abbot, I am come to lay my bones among  you.\" He died three days after, with, great composure and fortitude. He  said, shortly before his death--\"Had I but served my God as diligently  as I have served the king, he would not have forsaken me in my grey  hairs; but this is the just reward I must receive for my pains and  study, in not regarding my service to God, but only to my prince.\"    Melancthon, a few days before his death, although extremely debilitated,  delivered his usual lecture. At the termination of it, he said,  impressively--\"I am a dying man, and these are the three subjects for  intercession with God, which I leave to my children and their little  ones--that they may form part of his church, and worship him  aright--that they may be one in him, and live in harmony with each  other--and that they may be fellow-heirs of eternal life.\" The day  before his death, he addressed some present--\"God bestows talents on our  youth, do you see that they use them aright.\" While dying, his friends  discerned a slight motion of the countenance, which was peculiar to him  when deeply affected by religious joy.    W.             *       *       *       *       *        THE NOVELIST.      OSMYN AND ZAMBRI.    _A Persian Tale. From the French._    (_From a Correspondent._)      A worthy old Persian having arrived at the end of an irreproachable  life, experienced in his last moments the greatest uneasiness for the  fate of his two sons, whom he was about to leave without fortune,  without a livelihood, and without a prospect. The elder called Osmyn,  was twenty years of age, and the younger, eighteen, bore the name of  Zambri.    As the old man drew near his last hour, he thought much less of his own  sufferings than of the fate of his children, when his ear was agreeably  struck with a soft and melodious voice, which said to him, \"Fear  nothing, old man, I will watch over your children; die in peace as thou  hast lived. I bring a present for each of your sons; let them make good  use of it, and one day perhaps they may be re-united, and live in  happiness.\"    At these words a balsamic odour spread itself in the cottage, and a  bright light discovered to the view of the astonished Persian, the  features of a young man, whose expressive countenance had in it  something celestial. It was a beneficent genius, who after having  deposited his presents on the bed of the old man, vanished like  lightning. The old man called his two sons, they ran eagerly towards him  with a light, and approached the bed of their father, who related to  them the visit he had been honoured with, and showed them the presents  of the genius. On one side was a small box covered with brilliant  spangles; on the other a sheet of paper carefully sealed. \"Come Osmyn,\"  said the old man, \"you are the eldest, it is for you to choose.\"    Osmyn attracted by the richness of the box, chose it with eagerness, and  poor Zambri was obliged to be contented with the humble envelope. The  old man embraced them, blessed them, and died as one resigning himself  to the arms of hope. After having wept sincerely the death of so good a  father, and having rendered the last offices to his remains, the two  brothers were anxious to know what aid they should find in the presents  of the genius. Osmyn opened his little box and found it filled with  pastilles of divers forms and colours. He was almost tempted to laugh at  the meanness of such a gift, when he perceived these words written on  the lid of the box--\"_Each time that thou eatest one of these pastilles,  thine imagination will bring forth a poem perfect in all its parts,  sublime and delicate in its details, such in short as will surpass the  ablest works of the best Persian poets._\"    Osmyn did not want vanity; the possession of so fine a secret failed not  to turn his young brain, and a hundred illusions of fortune and glory  presented themselves at once to his imagination.    From the value of the present given by the genius to his brother, Zambri  doubted not that his paper contained also some marvellous secret. He  opened it and read with as much surprise as sorrow--\"_A new Receipt for  preparing Sherbet._\" Some lines pointed out the method of composing a  liquor, of which one drop only being infused in a bowl of Sherbet, would  give it a taste and perfume hitherto unknown to the most voluptuous  Asiatics.    Osmyn was overjoyed, and Zambri was in despair; Osmyn wished not to quit  his brother, but the orders of the genius were imperative. The two  brothers embraced each other tenderly, shed tears, and separated. The  eldest took the road to Bagdad, where all the learned, and all the poets  of Asia were assembled to attend the court of the Caliph. As to poor  Zambri, he quitted the cottage of his father, carrying nothing with him  but _the humble receipt for preparing Sherbet_, and leaving to chance  the direction of his course.    Before his arrival at Bagdad, Osmyn had already eaten half-a-dozen of  the pastilles, and consequently carried with him half-a-dozen poems,  beside which were to fade the productions of the greatest Eastern poets.  But he soon found that pretenders to talent often succeed better than  those who really possess it. He felt the necessity of connecting himself  with literary men, and men of the world; but he only found them occupied  with their business, their pleasures, or their own pretensions. Under  what title could he present himself? Under that of a poet? The court and  the city overflowed with them; they had already filled every avenue. To  consult his fellows would be to consult his rivals; to ask their praises  would be to ask a miser for his treasures. Besides, so many books  appeared, that people did not care to read. However, Osmyn's works were  published, but they were not even noticed in the multitude of similar  productions.    After having vegetated four or five years at Bagdad, without obtaining  anything but weak encouragement given by wise men, (who are without  influence because they are wise,) poor Osmyn began to lose the brilliant  hopes that formerly had dazzled him. However, by dint of eating the  pastilles, he at last attracted some notice. If it requires time for  genius to emerge from obscurity, no sooner is it known than recompense  is made for slow injustice. It is sought after not for itself, but for  the sake of vanity. Envy often avails itself of it as a fit instrument  subservient to its own purposes. Soon, in fact, the works of Osmyn only  were spoken of, and after languishing a long time unnoticed, he saw  himself at once raised to the pinnacle, without having passed the steps  which lead"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"84. ---- leucogenys (_Gr._)  285. ---- lencotis (_Gould_).  288.

I separated the Punjab Raven under the name of _Corvus lawrencei_  ('Lahore to Yarkand,' p. 83), and I then stated, what I wish now to  repeat, that if we are prepared to consider _C. corax, C. littoralis,  C. thibetanus_, and _C. japonensis_ all as one and the same species,  then _C. lawrencei_ too must be suppressed; but if any of these are  retained as distinct, then so must _C. lawrencei_ be[A].    [Footnote A: I think it impossible to separate the Punjab Raven  from the Ravens of Europe and other parts of the world, and I have  therefore merged it into _C. corax_.--ED.]    The Punjab Raven breeds throughout the Punjab (except perhaps in the  Dehra Ghazee Khan District), in Bhawulpoor, Bikaneer, and the northern  portions of Jeypoor and Jodhpoor, extending rarely as far south as  Sambhur. To Sindh it is merely a seasonal visitant, and I could not  learn that they breed there, nor have I ever known of one breeding  anywhere east of the Jumna. Even in the Delhi Division of the Punjab  they breed sparingly, and one must go further north and west to find  many nests.    The breeding-season lasts from early in December to quite the end of  March; but this varies a little according to season and locality,  though the majority of birds always, I think, lay in January.    The nest is generally placed in single trees of no great size,  standing in fields or open jungle. The thorny Acacias are often  selected, but I have seen them on Sisoo and other trees.    The nest, placed in a stout fork as a rule, is a large, strong,  compact, stick structure, very like a Rook's nest at home, and like  these is used year after year, whether by the same birds or others of  the same species I cannot say. Of course they never breed in company:  I _never_ found two of their nests within 100 yards of each other,  and, as a rule, they will not be found within a quarter of a mile of  each other.    Five is, I think, the regular complement of eggs; very often I have  only found four fully incubated eggs, and on two or three occasions  six have, I know, been taken in one nest, though I never myself met  with so many.    I find the following old note of the first nest of this species that I  ever took:--    \"At Hansie, in Skinner's Beerh, December 19, 1867, we found our first  Raven's nest. It was in a solitary Keekur tree, which originally of no  great size had had all but two upright branches lopped away. Between  these two branches was a large compact stick nest fully 10 inches deep  and 18 inches in diameter, and not more than 20 feet from the ground.  It contained five slightly incubated eggs, which the old birds evinced  the greatest objection to part with, not only flying at the head of  the man who removed them, but some little time after they had been  removed similarly attacking the man who ascended the tree to look at  the nest. After the eggs were gone, they sat themselves on a small  branch above the nest side by side, croaking most ominously, and  shaking their heads at each other in the most amusing manner, every  now and then alternately descending to the nest and scrutinizing every  portion of the cavity with their heads on one side as if to make sure  that the eggs were really gone.\"    Mr. W. Theobald makes the following note of this bird's nidification  in the neighbourhood of Pind Dadan Khan and Katas in the Salt Range:--    \"Lay in January and February; eggs, four only; shape, ovato-pyriform;  size, 1.7 by 1.3; colour, dirty sap green, blotched with blackish  brown; also pale green spotted with greenish brown and neutral; nest  of sticks difficult to get at, placed in well-selected trees or holes  in cliffs.\"    I have not verified the fact of their breeding in holes in cliffs, but  it is very possible that they do. All I found near Pind Dadan Khan  and in the Salt Range were doubtless in trees, but I explored a very  limited portion of these hills.    Colonel C.H.T. Marshall, writing from Bhawulpoor on the 17th February,  says: \"I succeeded yesterday in getting four eggs of the Punjab Raven.  The eggs were hard-set and very difficult to clean.\"    From Sambhur Mr. R.M. Adam tells us:--\"This Raven is pretty common  during the cold weather, but pairs are seen about here throughout the  year. They are very fond of attaching themselves to the camps of the  numerous parties of Banjaras who visit the lake.    \"I obtained a nest at the end of January which contained three eggs,  and a fourth was found in the parent bird. The nest was about 15 feet  from the ground in a Kaggera tree (_Acacia leucophloea_) which stood  on a bare sandy"]]]
