Dost thou not then suppose me void of rest,    Or think some demon agitates my breast?    Yon villagers, you know, are wont to say    Thy master's fam'd for writing many a lay,    'Mongst other matters too he's known to sing    The glorious acts of our victorious king;[6]    Whose martial fame resounds thro' every town;    Unparallel'd in wisdom and renown.    You know it well--and by this garden wall    P'rhaps Mons and Namur[7] at this instant fall.    What shouldst thou think if haply some should say    This noted chronicler's employ'd to-day    In writing something new--and thus his time    Devotes to thee--to paint his thoughts in rhyme?    My master, thou wouldst say, can ably teach,    And often tells me more than parsons preach;    But still, methinks, if he was forc'd to toil    Like me each day--to cultivate the soil,    To prune the trees, to keep the fences round;    Reduce the rising to the level ground,    Draw water from the fountains near at hand    To cheer and fertilize the thirsty land,    He would not trade in trifles such as these,    And drive the peaceful linnets from the trees.      Now, Anthony, I plainly see that you    Suppose yourself the busiest of the two;    But ah, methinks you'd tell a diff'rent tale    If two whole days beyond the garden pale    You were to leave the mattock and the spade    And all at once take up the poet's trade:    To give a manuscript a fairer face,    And all the beauty of poetic grace;    Or give the most offensive flower that blows    Carnation's sweets, and colours of the rose;    And change the homely language of the clown    To suit the courtly readers of the town--    Just such a work, in fact, I mean to say,    As well might please the critics of the day!      Soon from this work returning tir'd and lean,    More tann'd than though you'd twenty summers seen,    The wonted gard'ning tools again you'd take    Your long-accustom'd shovel and your rake;    And then exclaiming, you would surely say,    'Twere better far to labour many a day    Than e'er attempt to take such useless flights,    And vainly strive to gain poetic heights,    Impossible to reach--I might as soon    Ascend at once and land upon the moon!      Come, Anthony, attend: let me explain    (Although an idler) weariness and pain.    Man's ever rack'd and restless, here below,    And at his best estate must labour know.    Then comes fatigue. The Sisters nine may please    And promise poets happiness and ease;    But e'en amidst those trees, that cooling shade,    That calm retreat for them expressly made,    No rest they find--there rich effusions flow    In all the measures bardic numbers know:    Thus on their way in endless toil they move,    And spend their strength in labours that they love.    Beneath the trees the bards the muses haunt,    And with incessant toil are seen to pant;    But still amidst their pains, they pleasure find    An ample entertainment for the mind.    But, after all, 'tis plain enough to me,    A man unstudious, must unhappy be;    Who deems a dull, inactive life the best,    A life of laziness, a life of rest;    A willing slave to sloth--and well I know,    He suffers much who nothing has to do.    His mind beclouded, he obscurely sees,    And free from busy life imagines ease.    All sinful pleasures reign without control,    And passions unsubdued pollute the soul;    He thus indulges in impure desires,    Which long have lurk'd within, like latent fires:    At length they kindle--burst into a flame    On him they sport--sad spectacle of shame.    Remorse ensues--with every fierce disease.    The stone and cruel gout upon him seize;    To quell their rage some fam'd physicians come    Who scarce less cruel, crowd the sick man's room;    On him they operate--these learned folk,    Make him saw rocks, and cleave the solid oak;[8]    And gladly would the man his fate resign    For such an humble, happy state as thine.    Be thankful, Anthony, and think with me,    The poor hardworking man may happier be    If blest with strength, activity, and health,    Than those who roll in luxury and wealth.      Two truths important, I proceed to tell,    One is a truth, you surely know full well;    That labour is essential here below    To man--a source of weal instead of woe:    The other truth, few words suffice to prove,    No blame attaches to the life I love.    So still attend--but I must say no more,    I plainly see, you wish my sermon o'er;    You gape, you close your eyes, you drop your chin,    Again methinks I'd better not begin.    Besides, these melons seem to wish to know    The reason why they are neglected so;    And ask if yonder village holds its feast    And thou awhile art there detained a guest,    While all the flowery tribes make sad complaint.    For want of water they are grown quite faint.      _Tipton._       T.S.A.        [4] Anteuil, near Paris.        [5] Horace speaks thus to his steward in the country. Epistle      xiv. book 1.

The author is a first-rate poet,  but it appears that he undertook this task with some diffidence. We  have, however, few artists of literary attainments, and they are more  profitably employed than in authorship. Little apology was necessary,  for of all literary men, poets are best calculated to write on the Fine  Arts: and the genius of Poetry, Painting, Sculpture, and Music, is often  associated in one mind, in love of the subjects at least, if not in  practice.    Prefixed to the \"Lives,\" is a delightful chapter on British Art before  the birth of Hogarth, from which we quote the following:--    \"Poetry, Painting, Sculpture, and Music, are the natural offspring of  the heart of man. They are found among the most barbarous nations; they  flourish among the most civilized; and springing from nature, and not  from necessity or accident, they can never be wholly lost in the most  disastrous changes. In this they differ from mere inventions; and,  compared with mechanical discoveries, are what a living tree is to a log  of wood. It may indeed be said that the tongue of poetry is occasionally  silent, and the hand of painting sometimes stayed; but this seems not to  affect the ever-living principle which I claim as their characteristic.  They are heard and seen again in their season, as the birds and flowers  are at the coming of spring; and assert their title to such immortality  as the things of earth may claim. It is true that the poetry of  barbarous nations is rude, and their attempts at painting uncouth; yet  even in these we may recognise the foreshadowings of future excellence,  and something of the peculiar character which, in happier days, the  genius of the same tribe is to stamp upon worthier productions. The  future Scott, or Lawrence, or Chantrey, may be indicated afar-off in the  barbarous ballads, drawings, or carvings, of an early nation. Coarse  nature and crude simplicity are the commencement, as elevated nature and  elegant simplicity are the consummation of art.    \"When the Spaniards invaded the palaces of Chili and Peru, they found  them filled with works of art. Cook found considerable beauty of drawing  and skill of workmanship in the ornamented weapons and war-canoes of the  islanders of the South Sea; and in the interior recesses of India,  sculptures and paintings, of no common merit, are found in every  village. In like manner, when Caesar landed among the barbarians of  Britain, he found them acquainted with arts and arms; and his savage  successors, the Saxons, added to unextinguishable ferocity a love of  splendour and a rude sense of beauty, still visible in the churches  which they built, and the monuments which they erected to their princes  and leaders. All those works are of that kind called ornamental: the  graces of true art, the truth of action and the dignity of sentiment are  wanting; and they seem to have been produced by a sort of mechanical  process, similar to that which creates figures in arras. Art is, indeed,  of slow and gradual growth; like the oak, it is long of growing to  maturity and strength. Much knowledge of colour, much skill of hand,  much experience in human character, and a deep sense of light and shade,  have to be acquired, to enable the pencil to embody the conceptions of  genius. The artist has to seek for all this in the accumulated mass of  professional knowledge: which time has gathered for his instruction, and  with his best wisdom, and his happiest fortune, he can only add a little  more information to the common stock, for the benefit of his successors.  In no country has Painting risen suddenly into eminence. While Poetry  takes wing at once, free and unincumbered, she is retarded in her ascent  by the very mechanism to which she must at last owe at least half her  glory. In Britain, Painting was centuries in throwing off the fetters of  mere mechanical skill, and in rising into the region of genius. The  original spirit of England had appeared in many a noble poem, while the  two sister arts were still servilely employed in preserving incredible  legends, in taking the likeness of the last saint whom credulity had  added to the calendar, and in confounding the acts of the apostles in  the darkness of allegory.\"    Then follows an outline of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#2)"],[1," And so he sailed away for  Hispaniola (Santo Domingo) which appears to have become, a little later,  his favorite West Indian resort.    [Illustration: THE MORRO _Havana_]    He began his eastward journey on November 12th. As he did not reach Cape  Maisi, the eastern point of the island, until December 5th, he must have  made frequent stops to examine the shore. Referring to one of the ports  that he entered he wrote to the Spanish Sovereigns thus: \"The amenity of  this river, and the clearness of the water, through which the sand at the  bottom may be seen; the multitude of palm trees of various forms, the  highest and most beautiful that I have met with, and an infinity of other  great and green trees; the birds in rich plumage and the verdure of the  fields, render this country of such marvellous beauty that it surpasses all  others in charms and graces, as the day doth the night in lustre. For which  reason I often say to my people that, much as I endeavor to give a complete  account of it to your majesties, my tongue cannot express the whole truth,  nor my pen describe it; and I have been so overwhelmed at the sight of so  much beauty that I have not known how to relate it.\"    Columbus made no settlement in Cuba; his part extends only to the  discovery. On his second expedition, in the spring of 1494, he visited and  explored the south coast as far west as the Isle of Pines, to which he gave  the name _La Evangelista_. He touched the south coast again on his fourth  voyage, in 1503. On his way eastward from his voyage of discovery on the  coast of Central America, he missed his direct course to Hispaniola, and  came upon the Cuban shore near Cape Cruz. He was detained there for some  days by heavy weather and adverse winds, and sailed thence to his unhappy  experience in Jamaica. The work of colonizing remained for others. Columbus  died in the belief that he had discovered a part of the continent of Asia.  That Cuba was only an island was determined by Sebastian de Ocampo who  sailed around it in 1508. Baron Humboldt, who visited Cuba in 1801 and  again in 1825, and wrote learnedly about it, states that \"the first  settlement of the whites occurred in 1511, when Velasquez, under orders  from Don Diego Columbus, landed at Puerto de las Palmas, near Cape Maisi,  and subjugated the Cacique Hatuey who had fled from Haiti to the eastern  end of Cuba, where he became the chief of a confederation of several  smaller native princes.\" This was, in fact, a military expedition composed  of three hundred soldiers, with four vessels.    Hatuey deserves attention. His name is not infrequently seen in Cuba today,  but it is probable that few visitors know whether it refers to a man, a  bird, or a vegetable. He was the first Cuban hero of whom we have record,  although the entire reliability of the record is somewhat doubtful. The  notable historian of this period is Bartolome Las Casas, Bishop of Chiapa.  He appears to have been a man of great worth, a very tender heart, and an  imagination fully as vivid as that of Columbus. His sympathies were aroused  by the tales of the exceeding brutality of many of the early Spanish  voyagers in their relations with the natives. He went out to see for  himself, and wrote voluminously of his experiences. He also wrote with  exceeding frankness, and often with great indignation. He writes about  Hatuey. The inference is that this Cacique, or chieftain, fled from Haiti  to escape Spanish brutality, and even in fear of his life. There are other  translations of Las Casas, but for this purpose choice has been made of one  published in London about the year 1699. It is given thus:    \"There happened divers things in this island (Cuba) that deserve to be  remarked. A rich and potent Cacique named Hatuey was retired into the Isle  of Cuba to avoid that Slavery and Death with which the Spaniards menaced  him; and being informed that his persecutors were upon the point of landing  in this Island, he assembled all his Subjects and Domestics together, and  made a Speech unto them after this manner. \"You know, (said he) the Report  is spread abroad that the Spaniards are ready to invade this Island, and  you are not ignorant of the ill usage our Friends and Countrymen have met  with at their hands, and the cruelties they have committed at Haiti (so  Hispaniola is called in their Language). They are now coming hither with  a design to exercise the same Outrages and Persecutions upon us. Are  you ignorant (says he) of the ill Intentions of the People of whom I am  speaking? We know not (say they all with one voice) upon what account they  come hither, but we know they are a very wicked and cruel People. I'll tell  you then (replied the Cacique) that these Europeans worship a very covetous  sort of God, so that it is difficult to satisfy him; to perform the Worship  they render to this Idol, they will exact immense Treasures of us, and will  use their utmost endeavors to reduce us to a miserable state of Slavery,  or else put us to death.\" The historian leaves to the imagination and  credulity of his readers the task of determining just where and how he got  the full details of this speech and of the subsequent proceedings. The  report of the latter may well be generally correct inasmuch as there were  Spanish witnesses present, but the account of this oration, delivered prior  to the arrival of the Spanish invaders, is clearly open to a suspicion that  it may be more or less imaginary. But the historian continues: \"Upon this  he took a Box full of Gold and valuable Jewels which he had with him, and  exposing it to their view: Here is (said he) the God of the Spaniards, whom  we must honor with our Sports and Dances, to see if we can appease him and  render him propitious to us; that so he may command the Spaniards not to  offer us any injury. They all applauded this Speech, and fell a leaping and  dancing around the Box, till they had quite tired and spent themselves.  After which the Cacique Hatuey resuming his Discourse, continued to speak  to them in these terms: If we keep this God (says he) till he's taken away  from us, he'll certainly cause our lives to be taken away from us; and  therefore I am of opinion it will be the best way to cast him into the  river. They all approved of this Advice, and went all together with one  accord to throw this pretended God into the River.\"    But the Spaniards came and encountered the resistance of Hatuey and his  followers. The invaders were victorious, and Hatuey was captured and burned  alive. Las Casas relates that while the poor wretch was in the midst of the  flames, tied to a stake, \"a certain Franciscan Friar of great Piety and  Virtue, took upon him to speak to him of God and our Religion, and to  explain to him some Articles of Catholic Faith, of which he had never  heard a word before, promising him Eternal Life if he would believe and  threatening him with Eternal Torment if he continued obstinate in his  Infidelity. Hatuey reflecting on the matter, as much as the Place and  Condition in which he was would permit, asked the Friar that instructed  him, whether the Gate of Heaven was open to Spaniards; and being answered  that such of them as were good men might hope for entrance there: the  Cacique, without any farther deliberation, told him that he had no mind to  go to heaven for fear of meeting with such cruel and wicked Company as  they were; but he would much rather choose to go to Hell where he might be  delivered from the troublesome sight of such kind of People.\" And so died  the Cacique Hatuey. Four hundred years later, the Cuban Government named a  gunboat _Hatuey_, in his honor.    The Velasquez expedition, in the following year, founded Baracoa, now a  small city on the northern coast near the eastern extremity of the island.  It is a spot of exceeding scenic charm. It was established as the capital  city, but it held that honor for a few years only. In 1514 and 1515,  settlements were established at what is now Santiago, at Sancti Spiritus,  Trinidad, and Batabano. The latter was originally called San Cristobal de  la Habana, the name being transferred to the present city, on the north  coast, in 1519. It displaced the name Puerto de Carenas given to the  present Havana by Ocampo, who careened his vessels there in 1508. Baracoa  was made the seat of a bishopric, and a cathedral was begun, in 1518. In  1522, both the capital and the bishopric were transferred to Santiago, a  location more readily accessible from the new settlements on the south  coast, and also from Jamaica which was then included in the diocese.  Cuba, at about this period, was the point of departure for an important  expedition. In 1517, de Cordoba, with three vessels and 110 soldiers,  was sent on an expedition to the west for further and more northerly  exploration of the land discovered by Columbus in 1503. The coast from  Panama to Honduras had been occupied. The object of this expedition was to  learn what lay to the northward. The result was the discovery of Yucatan.  Cordoba returned to die of wounds received in a battle. A second and  stronger expedition was immediately despatched. This rounded the peninsula  and followed the coast as far as the present city of Vera Cruz. In 1518,  Hernan Cortez was _alcalde_, or mayor, of Santiago de Cuba. On November 18,  of that year, he sailed from that port in command of an expedition for  the conquest of Mexico, finally effected in 1521, after one of the most  romantic campaigns in the history of warfare. All that, however, is a story  in which Cuba has no place except that of the starting point and base of  the expedition. There is another story of the same kind, a few years later.  The first discovery of Florida is somewhat uncertain. It appears on an old  Spanish map dated 1502. Following the expedition of Ponce de Leon, in 1513,  and of Murielo, in 1516, Narvaez headed an expedition from Cuba in 1528  with"]]]
