[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#2)"],[1,"of the  Supreme Court at Colombo, I have received from his Interpreter, M.D. DE  SILVA GOONERATNE MODLIAR, a Singhalese gentleman of learning and  observation, many important notes, of which I have largely availed  myself, in relation to the wild animals, and the folk-lore and  superstitions of the natives in connection with them.    Of the latter I have inserted numerous examples; in the conviction that,  notwithstanding their obvious errors in many instances, these popular  legends and traditions occasionally embody traces of actual observation,  and may contain hints and materials deserving of minuter inquiry.    I wish distinctly to disclaim offering the present volume as a  compendium of the Natural History of Ceylon. I present it merely as a  \"memoire pour servir,\" materials to assist some future inquirer in the  formation of a more detailed and systematic account of the _fauna_ of  the island. My design has been to point out to others the extreme  richness and variety of the field, the facility of exploring it, and the  charms and attractions of the undertaking. I am eager to show how much  remains to do by exhibiting the little that has as yet been done.    The departments of _Mammalia_ and _Birds_ are the only two which can be  said to have as yet undergone tolerably close investigation; although  even in these it is probable that large additions still remain to be  made to the ascertained species. But, independently of forms and  specific characteristics, the more interesting inquiry into habits and  instincts is still open for observation and remark; and for the  investigation of these no country can possibly afford more inviting  opportunities than Ceylon.    Concerning the _Reptilia_ a considerable amount of information has been  amassed. The Batrachians and smaller Lizards have, I apprehend, been  imperfectly investigated; but the Tortoises are well known, and the  Serpents, from the fearful interest attaching to the race, and  stimulating their destruction, have been so vigilantly pursued, that  there is reason to believe that few, if any, varieties exist which have  not been carefully examined. In a very large collection, made by Mr.  CHARLES REGINALD BULLER during many years' residence in Kandy, and  recently submitted by him to Dr. Guenther, only one single specimen  proved to be new or previously unknown to belong to the island.    Of the _Ichthyology_ of Ceylon I am obliged to speak ill very different  terms; for although the materials are abundant almost to profusion,  little has yet been done to bring them under thoroughly scientific  scrutiny. In the following pages I have alluded to the large collection  of examples of Fishes sent home by officers of the Medical Staff, and  which still remain unopened, in the Fort Pitt Museum at Chatham; but I  am not without hope that these may shortly undergo comparison with the  drawings which exist of each, and that this branch of the island _fauna_  may at last attract the attention to which its richness so eminently  entitles it.    In the department of Entomology much has already been achieved; but an  extended area still invites future explorers; and one which the Notes of  Mr. Walker prefixed to the List of Insects in this volume, show to be of  extraordinary interest, from the unexpected convergence in Ceylon of  characteristics heretofore supposed to have been kept distinct by the  broad lines of geographical distribution.    Relative to the inferior classes of _Invertebrata_ very little has as  yet been ascertained. The Mollusca, especially the lacustrine and  fluviatile, have been most imperfectly investigated; and of the  land-shells, a large proportion have yet to be submitted to scientific  examination.    The same may be said of the _Arachnida_ and _Crustacea_. The jungle is  frequented by spiders, _phalangia_[1], and acarids, of which nothing is  known with certainty; and the sea-shore and sands have been equally  overlooked, so far as concerns the infinite variety of lobsters,  crayfish, crabs, and all their minor congeners. The _polypi, echini,  asterias_, and other _radiata_ of the coast, as well as the _acalephae_  of the deeper waters, have shared the same neglect: and literally  nothing has been done to collect and classify the infusoriae and minuter  zoophytes, the labours of Dr. Kelaart amongst the Diatomaceae being the  solitary exception.    [Footnote 1: Commonly called \"harvest-men.\"]    Nothing is so likely to act as a stimulant to future research as an  accurate conception of what has already been achieved. With equal  terseness and truth Dr. Johnson has observed that the traveller who  would bring back knowledge from any country must carry knowledge with  him at setting out: and I am not without hope that the demonstration I  now venture to offer, of the little that has already been done for  zoology in Ceylon, may serve to inspire others with a desire to resume  and complete the inquiry.

Now it is not essential that we should know exactly how much of the  building was finished by a certain year, or what stage towards  completion had been reached at any particular time; it is sufficient  at present that we should be able to indicate the general trend of the  operations,--and this would suggest the conclusion that, having  prepared so much as was necessary about the chancel, the builders went  on busily, after the dedication, to deal with the transept and the  nave. Then followed those four early bays of the nave which are  nearest to the east.    It is quite safe to assume upon various grounds that the work had been  carried on successfully up to this stage early in the twelfth century;  but neither the documentary evidence available, nor the condition of  the fabric, enables us to venture more than this surmise concerning  its condition at that time.    Between 1114 and the time of the second and serious fire in 1187, the  remainder of the whole scheme planned a hundred years before was  apparently finished.    The first fire had excited some public interest in the great  enterprise at Chichester, and from this an impetus was derived which  helped towards its execution, after the small damage caused by the  fire had been quickly repaired, for by about the year 1150 the four  western bays of the nave, with its aisles, must have been complete. It  should be understood that the fire in 1114 did not lead to any change  in the character of the church such as was occasioned by that other  fire which shall be considered presently; but the work had quietly  continued, so that the aisles of the nave were vaulted by about  1170-1180, the lady-chapel was completed, and in 1184 all was ready  for the second ceremony of consecration which then took place. It has  been assumed that this act implies that the whole of the original  scheme had been executed. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that  again there are but few authentic records to show in what manner the  work had been carried on, nor are there many indications of the way in  which the necessary materials and money were provided to help it  forward. But it is interesting to notice that in 1147 William, Earl of  Arundel, gave to the see that quarter of the city in which stood the  palace of the bishops, the residences of the canons, and the cathedral  church. This grant of land confirmed the see in its possession of all  that part of the city now within the bounds of the close.    [Illustration: THE WEST FRONT, ABOUT 1836.  _from Winkles's Cathedrals_.]    What, then, was the plan of that church which was designed to suit  the requirements set down by Bishop Ralph Luffa? The ground-plan at  the end of the volume shows the building as it now remains, after many  alterations have been made in the original scheme; but the arrangement  is still, in its main features, much the same as was at first devised.  The usual plan was adopted, and this was the provision of a nave and  chancel having a transept between them so as to make the form of a  cross. The nave had aisles along its whole length. These were extended  on both sides eastward of the transept, and continued as an ambulatory  round a semicircular apse. The transept also had a small apsidal  chapel on the east side of both its north and south arms. At the point  of intersection between the transept and the nave the supports of the  central tower rose. Between this and the west end there were eight  arches in each of the arcades opening north and south from the nave  into the aisles. Beyond the crossing towards the east there were three  similar arches in the arcades which connected the apse with the large  piers of the central tower. These three bays, together with the apse,  enclosed the chancel; and this comprised the sanctuary, which was that  part within the apse itself, and also the presbytery, or choir of the  priests, which occupied the remaining space between the apse and the  arch into the transept beneath the tower. At a later date the  accommodation of the choir was increased by making it occupy part of  the space farther to the west. Possibly it projected into the nave. At  the west end of each of the aisles of the nave a tower was placed, and  between these two towers was the chief public entrance to the church.  From the subsequent history of the structure it would appear that the  two western towers had been built up and finished, so far, at least,  as was necessary to allow of the completion of the nave with its  aisles and roofs. The same may be concluded of the central tower.    This latter probably rose only just above the ridge of the roofs. To  carry it up so far would have been dictated to the builders by  structural reasons; for such a height would be required to help the  stability of the piers and arches below, since they had to resist a  variety of opposed thrusts. But even this tower, low as it no doubt  was, like others of the same date, did not survive the dedication more  than about twenty-six years. The whole building was covered with a  high-pitched wooden roof over the nave, transept, and chancel; and  beneath the outer roof there was a flat inner ceiling of wood formed  between the tie beams, similar to those now to be seen at Peterborough  and S. Albans. The north and south aisles of the nave were protected  by roofs which sloped up from their eaves against the wall that rose  above the nave arcades. Internally the ceiling to these was a simple  groined vault supported by transverse arches.    Immediately above the vault of the aisles was the gallery of the  triforium. This was lighted throughout by small external round-headed  windows, some of which may still be seen embedded in the walls. The  aisles and ambulatory of the chancel were treated by the same methods.  In the triforium gallery, above the transverse arches of the aisles,  were other semicircular arches. These served a double purpose: they  acted as supports to the timber framework of the aisle roofs, and also  as a means of buttressing the upper part of the nave walling in which  the clerestory windows were placed. Such other buttresses as there had  been were broad and flat, with but little projection from the surface  of the wall. The windows throughout the building up to about the end  of the twelfth century were small in comparison with some of those  which were inserted at various times afterwards.    [Illustration: VIEW THROUGH THE SOUTH TRIFORIUM OF THE NAVE FROM THE  SOUTH-WEST TOWER. _From a photograph by Mr. F. Bund_.]    It has been remarked that the termination of the early chancel towards  the east was an apse, and that round this was carried the north and  south choir aisles in the form of a continuous ambulatory. From this  enclosing aisle--a semi-circle itself in form--three chapels were  projected, each with a semicircular apsidal termination. The central  one of the three was the lady-chapel. This consisted then of the three  western bays only of the present chapel. The lady-chapel was added  about eighty years after the early part of the nave had been built,  and has since been much altered.    The presence of this grouping of features is indicative of that  influence which Continental architecture had exercised upon English  art, and now that Norman government had been established that  influence became more directly French. But though so strongly affected  by this means, Anglo-Saxon character was always evident in work which  was a native expression of the thought and personality of those by  whom it was executed.    Thus we see that the plan which Ralph approved for the new church that  was to be built for him at Chichester was devised according to  accepted traditional arrangement. He adopted no new idea when he  decided what general form the cathedral should follow. The disposition  of the several parts differed in no wise from that which had been  followed during centuries before. The requirements of ritual had  decided long since what were those essential features of planning to  be insisted upon, for the pattern in germ was shown in the arrangement  of the Mosaic Tabernacle. In the earliest plans the same distribution  of parts was observed, though at a later date the transept was  introduced--an idea which no doubt had its origin in some practical  necessity, and was afterwards retained as being representative of an  ecclesiastical symbol.    Of the practical and artistic character of the architectural details  we shall see more in examining the exterior and the interior of the  church. These will lead us, of necessity, to deal more with  archaeology in its relation to the history of architecture rather than  of this particular church as a building used for ecclesiastical  purposes.    After the ceremony of 1184 building operations were continued, but the  records available do not tell about anything of much interest for the  next two or three years. Then in 1186-1187 a catastrophe occurred--the  cathedral was again burnt. But this time the effects of the fire were  much more disastrous than had been the case in 1114. So extensive was  the destruction that the entire roofing, as well as the internal flat  ceiling, was gone; and though we can glean no certain knowledge from  documentary evidence, it appears probable that the eastern section of  the building suffered more than any other, for whatever other causes  may have aided in the wreck of this part--a weakness in the masonry,  an insufficiency in the supports or abutments--the fall of such heavy  timbers as those which must have formed the outer roof and inner  ceiling of the chancel would in itself be sufficient to wreck the  remainder.    Whether the change in plan that now followed was really necessary  because of the damage that had been done, or whether the fire provided  a welcome opportunity by which new features might be introduced, we"]]]
