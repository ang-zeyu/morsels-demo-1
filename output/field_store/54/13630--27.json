KEEPING PACE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES DEMANDS IT.    Suffrage for men and suffrage for women in other lands, with few and  minor exceptions, has been granted by parliamentary act and not by  referenda. By such enactment the women of Australia were granted full  suffrage in Federal elections by the Federal Parliament (1902), and  each State or Province granted full suffrage in all other elections by  act of their Provincial Parliaments.[A] By such enactment the Isle  of Man, New Zealand, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Denmark gave equal  suffrage in all elections to women.[A] By such process the Parliaments  of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta gave full provincial suffrage  to their women in 1916. British Columbia referred the question to the  voters in 1916, but the Provincial Parliament had already extended  all suffrage rights except the parliamentary vote, and both political  parties lent their aid in the referendum which consequently gave a  majority in every precinct on the home vote and a majority of the  soldier vote was returned from Europe later. By parliamentary act all  other Canadian Provinces, the Provinces of South Africa, the  countries of Sweden[A] and Great Britain have extended far more voting  privileges than any woman citizen of the United States east of the  Missouri River (except those of Illinois) has received. To the women  of Belise (British Honduras), the cities of Rangoon (Burmah), Bombay  (India), the Province of Baroda (India), the Province of Voralberg  (Austria), and Laibach (Austria) the same statement applies. In  Bohemia, Russia and various Provinces of Austria and Germany,  the principle of representation is recognized by the grant to  property-holding women of a vote by proxy. The suffragists of France  reported just before the war broke out that the French Parliament was  pledged to extend universal municipal suffrage to women. Men and women  of high repute say the full suffrage is certain to be extended by  the British Parliament to the women of England, Scotland, Ireland and  Wales soon after the close of the war and already these women have all  suffrage rights except the vote for Parliamentary members. These facts  are strange since it was the United States which first established  general suffrage for men upon the two principles that \"taxation  without representation is tyranny\" and that governments to be just  should \"derive their consent from the governed.\" The unanswerable  logic of these two principles is responsible for the extension of  suffrage to men and women the world over. In the United States,  however, women are still taxed without \"representation\" and still  live under a government to which they have given no \"consent.\" IT IS  OBVIOUSLY UNFAIR TO SUBJECT WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY--WHICH BOASTS THAT  IT IS THE LEADER IN THE MOVEMENT TOWARD UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE--TO A  LONGER, HARDER, MORE DIFFICULT PROCESS THAN HAS BEEN IMPOSED BY OTHER  NATIONS UPON MEN OR WOMEN. American constitutions of the nation and  the states have closed the door to the simple processes by which men  and women of other countries have been enfranchised. An amendment to  our Federal Constitution is the nearest approach to them. To deny the  benefits of this method to the women of this country is to put upon  them a PENALTY FOR BEING AMERICANS.    [Footnote A: See Appendix A for dates and conditions.]      2. EQUAL RIGHTS DEMANDS IT.    Men of this country have been enfranchised by various extensions of  the voting privilege but IN NO SINGLE INSTANCE were they compelled to  appeal to an electorate containing groups of recently naturalized  and even unnaturalized foreigners, Indians, Negroes, large numbers of  illiterates, ne'er-do-wells, and drunken loafers. The Jews, denied the  vote in all our colonies, and the Catholics, denied the vote in  most of them, received their franchise through the revolutionary  constitutions which removed all religious qualifications for the vote  in a manner consistent with the self-respect of all. The property  qualifications for the vote which were established in every colony and  continued in the early state constitutions were usually removed by a  referendum but the question obviously went to an electorate limited to  property-holders only. The largest number of voters to which such an  amendment was referred was that of New York. Had every man voted who  was qualified to do so, the electorate would not have exceeded 200,000  and probably not more than 150,000.[A]    [Footnote A: Suffrage in the Colonies. New York Chapter. McKinley.]    The next extensions of the vote to men were made to certain tribes  of Indians by act of Congress; and to the Negro by amendment to the  Federal Constitution.    At least three-fourths of the present electors secured their votes  through direct naturalization or that of their forefathers. Congress  determines conditions of citizenship and state constitutions fix  qualifications of voters. In no instance has the foreign immigrant  been forced to plead with a vast electorate for his vote. The suffrage  has been \"thrust upon him\" without effort or even request on his  part. National and State constitutions not only close to women the  comparatively easy processes by which the vote was extended to men and  women of other countries but also those processes by which the vote  was secured to men of our own land. The simplest method now possible  is by amendment of the Federal Constitution. To deny the privilege of  that method to women is a discrimination against them so unjust and  insufferable that no fair-minded man North or South, East or West, can  logically share in the denial.      3. RELIEF FROM UNJUST CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTRUCTIONS DEMANDS IT.    The constitutions of many states have provided for amendments by such  difficult processes that they either have never been amended or have  not been amended when the subject is in the least controversial. Their  provisions not infrequently are utilized by opponents of a cause to  delay action for years. A present case illustrates. Newspapers in  Kentucky which have opposed woman suffrage, and still do so, have  started a campaign (December, 1916) to submit a woman suffrage  amendment to voters with the announced intention of securing its  defeat at the polls in order to remove it from politics for five years  as the same question cannot be again submitted for that length of  time.    There are state constitutions so impossible of amendment that women  of those states can only secure enfranchisement through Federal action  and fair play demands the submission of a Federal constitutional  amendment. (See Chapter II.)      4. PROTECTION FROM INADEQUATE ELECTION LAWS DEMANDS IT.    The election laws of all states make inadequate provision for  safeguarding the vote on constitutional amendments. Since election  laws do not protect suffrage referenda, suffragists justly demand the  method prescribed by our national constitution to appeal their case  from male voters at large to the higher court of Congress and the  Legislatures. (See Chapters III and IV.)      5. EQUAL STATUS OF MEN AND WOMEN VOTERS DEMANDS IT.    Until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment the National  Constitution did not discriminate against women but in Section 2 of  that amendment provision was made whereby a penalty may be directed  against any state which denies the right to vote to its _male  inhabitants_ possessed of the necessary qualifications as prescribed  by nation and state. If the entire 48 states should severally  enfranchise women their political status would still be inferior to  that of men, since no provision for national protection in their right  to vote would exist.    The women of eleven states are said to vote on equal terms with men.  As a matter of fact they do not, since they not only lose their vote  whenever they change their residence to any one of the 37 other states  (except Illinois, where they lose only a portion of their privileges),  but they enjoy no national protection in their right to vote. Women  justly demand \"Equal Rights for All and Special Privileges for None.\"  Amendment to the National Constitution alone can give them an equal  status. Equality of rights can never be secured through state by state  enfranchisement.      6. NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF QUESTION DEMANDS IT.    Woman suffrage in every other country is a National question. With  eleven American states and nearly half the territory of the civilized  world already won; with the statement of the press still unchallenged  that women voters were \"the balance of power\" which decided the last  presidential election, the movement has reached a position of national  significance in the United States. Any policy which seeks to shift  responsibility or to procrastinate action, is, to use the mildest  phraseology, unworthy of the Congress in whose charge the making of  American political history reposes.      7. TREATMENT OF QUESTION DEMANDS INTELLIGENCE.    The handicaps of a popular vote upon a question of human liberty  which must be described in technical language will be clear to all  who think. It is probable that at least a fourth of the voters in West  Virginia, one of the recent suffrage campaign states, could not define  the following words intelligently: constitution, amendment, franchise,  suffrage, majority, plurality. It is probable they would succeed  even less well at an attempt to give an account of the Declaration  of Independence, the Revolution, Taxation without Representation, the  will of the majority, popular government. Such men might make a fairly  intelligent choice of men for local offices because their minds are  trained to deal with persons and concrete things. They could decide  between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hughes with some discrimination, but would  have slight if any knowledge of the platforms upon which either stood.  A referendum in many of our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#2)"],[1,"authorities should also be informed  of any destruction or removal of monuments which may be noticed.    Another matter which should not be neglected is the obtaining  of such licences as may be required by law for the acquisition in the  country or export therefrom of objects of antiquity. Advice on this  matter can be obtained at the local School or National Museum.    It is possible that the traveller will begin his journey at a point  other than the capital. Inquiries should be made at the London head-  quarters of the Schools concerning residents at such places who may  be able to give advice to intending travellers.    The traveller will doubtless bring back with him such antiquities as  he is permitted to export. A word of general advice on this matter  may not be out of place here. The essential value of antiquities,  apart from their purely artistic interest, lies in the circumstances  in which they are found. The inexperienced traveller is apt to pick  up a number of objects haphazard, without accurately noting their  find-spots, and even, getting tired of them, as a child of flowers  that he has picked, to discard them a mile or two away. If the first  act is a blunder, the second is a crime; it is better to leave them  lying in place. For the same reason, it is highly desirable that  objects found together (e.g. the contents of a tomb) should as far as  possible be kept together, or at least that accurate record of the  whole group should be made, since the archaeological value of a find  may depend on a single object, apparently of small importance.  Nothing, for instance, is more common, or more distressing to the  numismatist, than the division of a hoard of coins among various  persons before they have been examined by an expert. If they must be  divided, good impressions should at least be made by one of the  methods described in Chapter II, and, if the coins are of gold or  silver, the weights should be noted. This should be done even if the  coins, to the inexperienced eye, appear to be all alike. The  knowledge that any coin from a hoard may be of greater value than a  similar coin found singly may induce finders to report such finds  before dispersing them. What applies to coins is equally applicable,  in various ways, to all classes of antiquities.    It is assumed that the primary object of the traveller is not  speculation in the pecuniary value of the antiquities that he may  acquire, although he may be not unreasonably inclined to recover some  of his expenses by disposing of objects which do not appeal to him.  Should that be so, although the authorities of public museums  obviously cannot be agents or valuers in such transactions between  the owner and private collectors, they are as obviously willing to  consider offers which are made to their museums in the first instance  and, if the objects are not required by them, to advise the owner in  what quarter he may be likely to meet with a purchaser.          CHAPTER II      METHOD      1. Outfit.    Each traveller will require to provide for his special interests; but  for any archaeological work the following things are desirable. Note-  books of squared paper. Drawing-blocks of blue-squared paper. Paper  for wet squeezes, and for dry squeezes. Brush for wet squeezes (spoke  brush). One or two so-metre tapes. A few bamboo gardening canes for  markers in planning. Divide one in inches or centimetres for  measuring buildings. A steel rod, 3 ft. x 1 inch for probing. Field-  glass, or low-power telescope. Prismatic compass with card partly  black, to see at night. Large and small celluloid protractors for  plotting angles on plans. Plotting-scale, tenths of inches and  millimetres. Maps of the district, the best available. Aneroid  barometer, if collecting flints; small size; can be tested by  observing in a tall lift, or by putting in a tumbler and pressing the  hand air-tight over the mouth. The zero error, or absolute values,  are not wanted for levelling, only delicacy in small variations.  Magnifiers, a few pocket size; will also serve for presents.  Indelible pencils, pens, and ink in strong corked pocket bottle.  Reservoir pens dry up too much in some climates. China ink for  permanent marking. Strips of adhesive paper, about a inch and a  inches wide, to put round objects for labelling. Strong steel pliers,  wire-cutting. A few pocket-knives will serve for presents. It is best  to carry money in a little bag or screw of paper, loose in the jacket  pocket, it in a risky district. It can then be dropped on any alarm  and picked up afterwards.    Photographic.[1]  In the selection of a camera much will depend upon the nature of the  work to be undertaken, the conditions of travel, and the climate to  which the camera will be exposed. For accurate work a stand camera is  always to be preferred to one of the hand variety, and care should be  taken to choose an instrument that is strongly made and of simple  construction. The essentials of a good stand camera are that it shall  be rigid, possess a rising and falling front, a swing back, and  bellows which will be capable of extension to fully double the focal  length of the lens to be used with it.    [1]Prof. Petrie is not responsible for this section, which is due to  the kind assistance of some professional photographers.-ED.    The rising and falling front gives a power of modifying the field of  view in a vertical direction. The swing back preserves the  verticality of architectural subjects. In some cases, when used with  the pivots vertical, it is a help in focussing the subject. The  possible extension of the distance between the lens stop and the  ground glass to twice the focal length (which is as a rule the  distance between the same points, when a distant object is in focus)  enables a small subject to be reproduced in natural size.    For work abroad where extremes of temperature or excessive variations  have to be contended with, a special tropical camera is supplied by  most of the leading makers. Its well-seasoned hard wood and metal-  bound joints render it suitable for hard wear, and reduce the risk of  leakage through warping or shrinkage. The tripod stand should be of  the so-called threefold variety, with sliding legs which can be  adapted to broken ground. If a loose screw is used for attaching the  camera to the stand, a spare screw should be kept in reserve. It is  important that this stand should be strongly made, and light patterns  subject to undue vibrations in the wind should be discarded. For  photographing small objects in the studio, a small table is more  convenient than a tripod support. If the camera will not sit flat on  the table, a bed can easily be designed for it. Better work will be  done if this is prepared in advance than if an improvised support is  used. As regards the size of the outfit, quarter-plate (3 1/4 x 4 1/4  inches) will usually be found to be large enough for the traveller.  For anything in the nature of studio work in a museum or in connexion  with an excavation a half-plate camera (6 1/2 x 4 3/4 inches) is more  satisfactory. Where a hand camera is preferred it should be one  capable of adjustment of focus, and here again, strength and  simplicity should be looked for. It should be provided with effective  tripod legs, for studied exposures. Plates or flat films are  preferable to roll fills [2] which are difficult to manipulate away  from home. Flat films are less bulky and less breakable than glass,  and can be sent by post. They are supplied by the makers in packs of  12 for daylight loading into a film-pack adapter, which must be  provided to take the place of the ordinary dark slides for glass  plates. The lens should be a modern anastigmatic by a good maker. A  focal length of about six inches will be best for a quarter-plate  camera. A bad lens makes success impossible even by accident.    [2] Transcriber's note: 'fills' in the original text is possibly a  misprint for 'films'.    The stops will probably be of the Iris pattern, incorporated in the  lens and so not likely to be lost, as often happens with loose stops.    A few words on the theory and use of the stops and on the F-notation  may be of service. The speed of a photographic lens depends on the  ratio of the effective aperture to the focal length. Thus any two  lenses used at apertures of F/8, that is at apertures having  diameters one-eighth of their respective focal lengths, should be of  the same speed, though both lenses and apertures may be very  different. In a given lens, the speed varies directly with the area  of the aperture admitting the light, that is with the square of the  diameter of the aperture. The series of stops usually employed is  calculated so that each aperture is half the area of the preceding.  Stated in terms of the focal length they are known as F/5.6, F/8,  F/11.3, F/16, F/22.6, F/32, &c. Since the squares of those numbers,  31.4, 64, 127.7, 256, 510.7, 1024 are approximately each twice the  preceding number of the series, the apertures, F(ocal length),  divided by the successive numbers as denominators, are each half the  area of the preceding and require twice the exposure, F/16 requires  twice the 'exposure of F/11.3, and four times that of F/8, and so  throughout the scale.    Stops are used to regulate either 'depth of focus' or length of  exposure. The 'depth of focus' means the distance before and behind  the point in theoretically accurate focus, at which objects are  sufficiently focussed, for the purpose the photographer has in view.  This length is greatest when only the central portion of the lens is  in use. It is greatest with a pinhole, and least with a full  aperture. Hence a small stop is required if the picture is to include  near and far objects, while a large aperture may be used if all the  subject is far enough away to be in clear focus--say more than 25  feet--or if it is a flat surface.
