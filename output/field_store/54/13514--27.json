Princess Helen was born of an egg,      And scarcely ten years had gone by,    When Theseus beginning to beg,      Decoyed the young chicken to fly.    When Tyndarus heard the disaster,      He crackled and thunder'd like Etna,    So out gallop'd Pollux and Castor,      And caught her a furlong from Gretna.        Singing rattledum, Greek Romanorum,          And hey classicality row.        Singing birchery, floggera, borum,          And folderol whack rowdy dow.      The newspapers puffed her each day,      Till the princes of Greece came to woo her,    Then coaxing the rest to give way,      She took Menalaus unto her,    So said they, \"though we grieve to resign,      Yet if ever you're put to a shift,    Let your majesty drop us a line,      And we'll all of us lend you a lift.        With our rattledum, &c.\"      Menelaus was happy to win her.      But she soon found a cure for his passion,    By hobbing or nobbing at dinner,      With Paris, a Trojan of fashion.    This chap was a slyish young dog,      The most jessamy fellow in life,    For he drank Menalaus' grog,      And d--me made off with his wife.        Singing rattledum, &c.      The princes were sent for, who swore      They would punish this finikin boy;    So Achilles and two or three more,      Undertook the destruction of Troy.    But Achilles grew quite ungenteel,      And prevented their stirring a peg,    Till Paris let fly at his heel,      And he found himself laid by the leg.        With his rattledum, &c.      The Grecians demolish'd the city,      And then (as the poets have told)    Dame Helen might still be called pretty,      Though very near sixty years old.    Menelaus, when madam was found,      Took her snugly away in his chaise,    So Troy being burnt to the ground,      Why the story goes off with a blaze.        And a rattledum, &c.           *       *       *       *       *      HORSE-CHESTNUTS.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror._)      In a recent number there was a notice of the uses of the _Esculus  Hippocastaneus_, or horse chestnuts; but a very important one was  omitted, namely, its substitution occasionally for Peruvian bark in  cases of intermittent fever. This disorder, known better by the name of  ague, had been formerly epidemic in Ireland, where the humidity of the  atmosphere is continually increased by the exhalation of the lochs and bogs  with which the country abounds. In consequence, however, of the formation  of the Grand and Royal Canals, and the drainage of the waters in their  vicinity, the tendency to this disease was greatly lessened; and about  twenty years ago the disorder was so rare in Dublin and the neighbourhood,  that the medical students often complained that they graduated without ever  having an opportunity of seeing in the hospitals a single case of this once  almost universal disorder. In consequence, however, of the extreme wetness  of one summer and autumn, agues again resumed their ascendancy, and the  hospitals and dispensaries became crowded with intermittent patients, and  all the bark of the druggists and apothecaries was put into requisition;  but to the surprise and disappointment of all the medical men, this  infallible specific was altogether inert and powerless, and after repeated  trials and disappointments, it was abandoned as useless. It was now a  matter of importance to ascertain the cause of this extraordinary  failure, whether it arose from the altered character of the complaint,  or from the deteriorated quality of the medicine; and it was found to be  the latter. In consequence of the long cessation of intermittent fever,  bark had been little used or called for, and the stock had remained so  long on hand, that it had become effete and worthless. It was necessary  then to try some substitute. Quassia-wood, the acorus calamus, and other  bitters and aromatics, were tried; but that which seemed to succeed best  was the bark and kernel of the horse-chestnut. The nut was moderately  dried in a stove, so as to be capable of being powdered, and in that state  was exhibited in substance with cayenne pepper and other aromatics. The  bark was taken in infusions and decoctions with quassia, and the effects  were sometimes very decided and satisfactory, forming a providential  substitute for the only kind of bark then to be procured in Ireland.

It  consists of a thin concave of copper, fixed by three wires, at about an  inch above the chimney-glass of the lamp, yet capable of being taken off  at pleasure. The gaseous carbonaceous matter which occasionally escapes  from the top of lamps, is thus arrested beneath the concave cap, and  subsequently consumed by the heat of the flame, instead of passing off  into the room, in the form of smoke or smut on the ceiling and walls.    [The \"Technical Repository,\" may have the credit of introducing this  contrivance to the British public; but it is somewhat curious that it had  not been previously adopted, since scores of lamps thus provided, are to  be seen in the cafes and restaurateurs of Paris. _Apropos_, the French oil  burns equal in brightness to our best gas, and as we are informed, this  purity is obtained by filtration through charcoal.--ED.]      _Caddis Worms._    The transformation of the deserted cases of numberless minute insects into  a constituent part of a solid rock, first formed at the bottom of a lake,  then constituting the sides of deep valleys, and the tabular summits of  lofty hills, is a phenomenon as striking as the vast reefs of coral  constructed by the labours of minute polyps. We remember to have seen such  _caddis-worms_, as they are called by fishermen, very abundant in the  wooden troughs constructed by the late Dr. Sibthorp, for aquatic plants,  in the botanic garden at Oxford, to the cases of which many small shells  of the G. Planorbis Limnea and Cyclas were affixed, precisely in the same  manner as in the fossil tubes of Auvergne; an incrusting spring,  therefore, may, perhaps, be all that is wanting to reproduce, on the banks  of the Isis or the Charwell, a rock similar in structure to that of the  Limagne. Mr. Kirby, in his \"Entomology,\" informs us, that these larvae  ultimately change into a four-winged insect. If you are desirous to examine  them in their aquatic state, \"you have only, (he says) to place yourself by  the side of a clear and shallow pool of water, and you cannot fail to  observe at the bottom little oblong moving masses, resembling pieces of  straw, wood, or even stone--of the larvae itself, nothing is to be seen  but the head and six legs, by means of which it moves itself in the water,  and drags after it the case in which the rest of the body is enclosed, and  into which, on any alarm, it instantly retires. The construction of these  habitations is very various. Some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11408"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The same ceremony was practised in Britain,  being a Druidical rite, and the name (_Beltin day_) remains, although  the custom from which it originated, has in England, at least, been long  forgotten.    Guthrie, in his \"Geographical Grammar,\" tells us, that the English  language is a compound of the Saxon, the French, and the _Celtic_. As  far as this latter is concerned, the assertion appears to me to have  been made without due consideration; I do not believe that there are  twenty words of _genuine Celtic_ in the English language; there are, it  is true, a very few Irish words, which have become as it were, English  denizens, and of these I have sent you a specimen above; but I do not  believe it possible to increase their number to twenty, even in broad  Scotch, in which dialect of the Saxon (from the neighbourhood of the  Highlanders who use the Irish language) some Celtic words might be  expected, but very few occur;[2] there is, however, one very curious  exception to this rule, and for which, I confess, I am unable to  account, (though perhaps your correspondent, _Rupert C._ in No. 342,  might,) it is this--that in Grose's _Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, or  Cant Language_, if the words which are evidently figurative be thrown  out, nearly the whole of what remain are pure Irish.

(_For the Mirror._)      The Turks use the largest cannon of any people in Europe. In our ships,  and I believe in our batteries, we seldom use a heavier gun than a  32-pounder. No man-of-war carries a gun of a larger calibre; but the  Turks make use of 800-pounders. Mahommed II. is stated to have used at  the siege of Constantinople, in 1453, cannon of an immense calibre, and  stone shot. When Sir J. Duckworth passed the Dardanelles to attack  Constantinople, in 1807, his fleet was dreadfully shattered by the  immense shot thrown from the batteries. The Royal George (of 110 guns)  was nearly sunk by only one shot, which carried away her cut-water, and  another cut the main-mast of the Windsor Castle nearly in two; a shot  knocked two ports of the Thunderer into one; the Repulse (74) had her  wheel shot away and twenty-four men killed and wounded by a single shot,  nor was the ship saved but by the most wonderful exertions. The heaviest  shot which struck our ships was of granite, and weighed 800 pounds, and  was two feet two inches in diameter. One of these huge shots, to the  astonishment of our tars, stove in the whole larboard bow of the Active;  and having thus crushed this immense mass of timber, the shot rolled  ponderously aft, and brought up abreast the main hatchway, the crew  standing aghast at the singular spectacle. One of these guns was cast in  brass in the reign of Amurath; it was composed of two parts, joined by a  screw at the chamber, its breach resting against massy stone work; the  difficulty of charging it would not allow of its being fired more than  once; but, as a Pacha said, \"that single discharge would destroy almost  the whole fleet of an enemy.\" The Baron de Trott, to the great terror of  the Turks, resolved to fire this gun. The shot weighed 1,100 pounds, and  he loaded it with 330 pounds of powder: he says, \"I felt a shock like an  earthquake, at the distance of eight hundred fathoms. I saw the ball  divide into three pieces, and these fragments of a rock crossed the  Strait, and rebounded on the mountain.\"    W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *      AN ORIGINAL SCOTCH SONG FOR THE ANNIVERSARY OF ST.

(_For the Mirror._)      This word is formed from the ancient Latin _bancus_ a _bench_, or  _table_, and _ruptus, broken_. Bank originally signified a bench, which  the first bankers had in the public places, in markets, fairs, &c. on  which they told their money, wrote their bills of exchange, &.c. Hence,  when a banker failed, they broke his bank, to advertise the public that  the person to whom the bank belonged was no longer in a condition to  continue his business. As this practice was very frequent in Italy, it  is said the term bankrupt is derived from the Italian _banco_ rotto,  broken bench. Cowel (in his 4th Institute 227) rather chooses to deduce  the word from the French _banque, table_, and _route, vestigium, trace_,  by metaphor from the sign left in the ground, of a table once fastened  to it and now gone. On this principle he traces the origin of bankrupts  from the ancient Roman _mensarii_ or _argentarii_, who had their  _tabernae_ or _mensae_ in certain public places; and who, when they  fled, or made off with the money that had been entrusted to them, left  only the sign or shadow of their former station behind them.    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      ORIGIN OF THE WORD _BROKER_, &c.    (_For the Mirror._)      The origin of this word is contested; some derive it from the French  _broyer, \"to grind_;\" others from _brocader, to cavil or riggle_; others  deduce broker from a trader _broken_, and that from the Saxon _broc_,  \"misfortune,\" which is often the true reason of a man's breaking. In  which view, a broker is a broken trader, by misfortune; and it is said  that none but such were formerly admitted to that employment. The Jews,  Armenians, and Banians are the chief brokers throughout most parts of  the Levant and the Indies. In Persia, all affairs are transacted by a  sort of brokers, whom they call \"_delal_\" i.e. \"_great talkers_.\" Their  form of contract in buying and selling is remarkable, being done in the  profoundest silence, only by touching each other's fingers:--The buyer,  loosening his _pamerin_, or girdle, spreads it on his knee; and both he  and the seller, having their hands underneath, by the intercourse of the  fingers, mark the price of pounds, shillings, &c., demanded, offered,  and at length agreed on. When the seller takes the buyer's whole hand,  it denotes a thousand, and as many times as he squeezes it, as many  thousand pagods or roupees, according to the species in question  demanded; when he only takes the five fingers, it denotes five hundred;  and when only one, one hundred; taking only half a finger, to the second  joint, denotes fifty; the small end of the finger, to the first joint,  stands for ten. This _legerdemain_, or _squeezing system_, would not do  for the _latitude_ of London.

(_For the Mirror._)      The loss which the scientific world has lately sustained by the death of  Dr. Gall, will be longer and more deeply felt than any which it has  experienced for some years. This celebrated philosopher and physician  was born in the year 1758, of respectable parents, at a small village in  the duchy of Baden, where he received the early part of his education.  He afterwards went to Brucksal, and then to Strasburgh, in which city he  commenced his medical studies, and became a pupil of the celebrated  Professor Hermann. From Strasburgh he removed to Vienna, where he  commenced practice, having taken the degree of M.D. In this capital,  however, he was not permitted to develope his new system of the  functions of the brain; and from his lectures being interdicted, and the  illiberal opposition which he here met with, as well as in other parts  of Austria, he determined to visit the north of Germany. Here he was  well received in all the cities through which he passed, as well as in  Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark, and explained the doctrines he had founded  on his observations from _nature_ before several sovereigns, who  honoured him with such marks of approbation and respect as were due to  his talents. In the course of his travels he likewise visited England,  and at length, in 1807, settled in Paris, where his reputation had  already preceded him, and which, from its central situation, he  considered as the fittest place for disseminating his system.
