He knows all that his Western scientific brother knows about  the physiological effect of correct breathing, but he also knows that  the air contains more than oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen, and that  something more is accomplished than the mere oxygenating of the blood.  He knows something about \"prana,\" of which his Western brother is  ignorant, and he is fully aware of the nature and manner of handling  that great principle of energy, and is fully informed as to its effect  upon the human body and mind. He knows that by rhythmical breathing  one may bring himself into harmonious vibration with nature, and aid  in the unfoldment of his latent powers. He knows that by controlled  breathing he may not only cure disease in himself and others, but also  practically do away with fear and worry and the baser emotions.    To teach these things is the object of this work. We will give in a  few chapters concise explanations and instructions, which might be  extended into volumes. We hope to awaken the minds of the Western  world to the value of the Yogi \"Science of Breath.\"          CHAPTER III.      THE EXOTERIC THEORY OF BREATH.    In this chapter we will give you briefly the theories of the Western  scientific world regarding the functions of the respiratory organs,  and the part in the human economy played by the breath. In subsequent  chapters we will give the additional theories and ascertained facts of  the Oriental school of thought and research. The Oriental accepts the  theories and facts of his Western brothers (which have been known to  him for centuries) and adds thereto much that the latter do not now  accept, but which they will in due time \"discover\" and which, after  renaming, they will present to the world as a great truth.    Before taking up the Western idea, it will perhaps be better to give a  hasty general idea of the Organs of Respiration.    The Organs of Respiration consist of the lungs and the air passages  leading to them. The lungs are two in number, and occupy the pleural  chamber of the thorax, one en each side of the median line, being  separated from each other by the heart, the greater blood vessels and  the larger air tubes. Each lung is free in all directions, except at  the root, which consists chiefly of the bronchi, arteries and veins  connecting the lungs with the trachea and heart. The lungs are spongy  and porous, and their tissues are very elastic. They are covered with  a delicately constructed but strong sac, known as the pleural sac, one  wall of which closely adheres to the lung, and the other to the inner  wall of the chest, and which secretes a fluid which allows the inner  surfaces of the walls to glide easily upon each other in the act of  breathing.    The Air Passages consist of the interior of the nose, pharynx, larynx,  windpipe or trachea, and the bronchial tubes. When we breathe, we draw  in the air through the nose, in which it is warmed by contact with the  mucous membrane, which is richly supplied with blood, and after it has  passed through the pharynx and larynx it passes into the trachea or  windpipe, which subdivides into numerous tubes called the bronchial  tubes (bronchia), which in turn subdivide into and terminate in minute  subdivisions in all the small air spaces in the lungs, of which the  lungs contain millions. A writer has stated that if the air cells of  the lungs were spread out over an unbroken surface, they would cover  an area of fourteen thousand square feet.    The air is drawn into the lungs by the action of the diaphragm, a  great, strong, flat, sheet-like muscle, stretched across the chest,  separating the chest-box from the abdomen. The diaphragm's action is  almost as automatic as that of the heart, although it may be  transformed into a semi-voluntary muscle by an effort of the will.  When it expands, it increases the size of the chest and lungs, and the  air rushes into the vacuum thus created. When it relaxes the chest and  lungs contract and the air is expelled from the lungs.    Now, before considering what happens to the air in the lungs, let us  look a little into the matter of the circulation of the blood. The  blood, as you know, is driven by the heart, through the arteries, into  the capillaries, thus reaching every part of the body, which it  vitalizes, nourishes and strengthens. It then returns by means of the  capillaries by another route, the veins, to the heart, from whence it  is drawn to the lungs.    The blood starts on its arterial journey, bright red and rich, laden  with life-giving qualities and properties. It returns by the venous  route, poor, blue and dull, being laden down with the waste matter of  the system. It goes out like a fresh stream from the mountains; it  returns as a stream of sewer water. This foul stream goes to the right  auricle of the heart. When this auricle becomes filled, it contracts  and forces the stream of blood through an opening in the right  ventricle of the heart, which in turn sends it on to the lungs, where  it is distributed by millions of hair-like blood vessels to the air  cells of the lungs, of which we have spoken. Now, let us take up the  story of the lungs at this point.    The foul stream of blood is now distributed among the millions of tiny  air cells in the lungs. A breath of air is inhaled and the oxygen of  the air comes in contact with the impure blood through the thin walls  of the hair-like blood vessels of the lungs, which walls are thick  enough to hold the blood, but thin enough to admit the oxygen to  penetrate them. When the oxygen comes in contact with the blood, a  form of combustion takes place, and the blood takes up oxygen and  releases carbonic acid gas generated from the waste products and  poisonous matter which has been gathered up by the blood from all  parts of the system.    The blood thus purified and oxygenated is carried back to the heart,  again rich, red and bright, and laden with life-giving properties and  qualities. Upon reaching the left auricle of the heart, it is forced  into the left ventricle, from whence it is again forced out through  the arteries on its mission of life to all parts of the system. It is  estimated that in a single day of twenty-four hours, 35,000 pints of  blood traverse the capillaries of the lungs, the blood corpuscles  passing in single file and being exposed to the oxygen of the air on  both of their surfaces. When one considers the minute details of the  process alluded to, he is lost in wonder and admiration at Nature's  infinite care and intelligence.    It will be seen that unless fresh air in sufficient quantities reaches  the lungs, the foul stream of venous blood cannot be purified, and  consequently not only is the body thus robbed of nourishment, but the  waste products which should have been destroyed are returned to the  circulation and poison the system, and death ensues. Impure air acts  in the same way, only in a lessened degree. It will also be seen that  if one does not breathe in a sufficient quantity of air, the work of  the blood cannot go on properly, and the result is that the body is  insufficiently nourished and disease ensues, or a state of imperfect  health is experienced. The blood of one who breathes improperly is, of  course, of a bluish, dark color, lacking the rich redness of pure  arterial blood. This often shows itself in a poor complexion. Proper  breathing, and a consequent good circulation, results in a clear,  bright complexion.    A little reflection will show the vital importance of correct  breathing. If the blood is not fully purified by the regenerative  process of the lungs, it returns to the arteries in an abnormal state,  insufficiently purified and imperfectly cleansed of the impurities  which it took up on its return journey. These impurities if returned  to the system will certainly manifest in some form of disease, either  in a form of blood disease or some disease resulting from impaired  functioning of some insufficiently nourished organ or tissue.    The blood, when properly exposed to the air in the lungs, not only has  its impurities consumed, and parts with its noxious carbonic acid gas,  but it also takes up and absorbs a certain quantity of oxygen which it  carries to all parts of the body, where it is needed in order that  Nature may perform her processes properly. When the oxygen comes in  contact with the blood, it unites with the hemoglobin of the blood and  is carried to every cell, tissue, muscle and organ, which it  invigorates and strengthens, replacing the worn out cells and tissue  by new materials which Nature converts to her use. Arterial blood,  properly exposed to the air, contains about 25 per cent of free  oxygen.    Not only is every part vitalized by the oxygen, but the act of  digestion depends materially upon a certain amount of oxygenation of  the food, and this can be accomplished only by the oxygen in the blood  coming in contact with the food and producing a certain form of  combustion. It is therefore necessary that a proper supply of oxygen  be taken through the lungs. This accounts for the fact that weak lungs  and poor digestion are so often found together. To grasp the full  significance of this statement, one must remember that the entire body  receives nourishment from the food assimilated, and that imperfect  assimilation always means an imperfectly nourished body. Even the  lungs themselves depend upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#2)"],[1,"to be bound up with matter and energy in a wonderful combination,  and is seen to be subject to laws outside of itself, and to be varying,  inconstant, and changeable, which attributes cannot be conceived of as  belonging to the Absolute. Mind as we know it, as well as Matter and  Energy, is held by the highest occult teachers to be but an appearance  and a relativity of something far more fundamental and enduring, and we  are compelled to fall back upon that old term which wise men have used  in order to describe that Something Else that lies back of, and under,  Matter, Energy and Mind--and that word is \"Spirit.\"    We cannot tell just what is meant by the word \"Spirit,\" for we have  nothing with which to describe it. But we can think of it as meaning  the \"essence\" of Life and Being--the Reality underlying Universal Life.    Of course no name can be given to this One, that will fitly describe  it. But we have used the term \"The Absolute\" in our previous lessons,  and consider it advisable to continue its use, although the student may  substitute any other name that appeals to him more strongly. We do not  use the word God (except occasionally in order to bring out a shade of  meaning) not because we object to it, but because by doing so we would  run the risk of identifying The Absolute with some idea of a personal  god with certain theological attributes. Nor does the word \"Principle\"  appeal to us, for it seems to imply a cold, unfeeling, abstract thing,  while we conceive the Absolute Spirit or Being to be a warm, vital,  living, acting, feeling Reality. We do not use the word Nature, which  many prefer, because of its materialistic meaning to the minds of many,  although the word is very dear to us when referring to the outward  manifestation of the Absolute Life.    Of the real nature of The Absolute, of course, we can know practically  nothing, because it transcends all human experience and Man has nothing  with which he can measure the Infinite. Spinoza was right when he said  that \"to define God is to deny him,\" for any attempt to define, is, of  course an attempt to limit or make finite the Infinite. To define a  thing is to identify it with something else--and where is the something  else with which to identify the Infinite? The Absolute cannot be  described in terms of the Relative. It is not Something, although it  contains within itself the reality underlying Everything. It cannot be  said to have the qualities of any of its apparently separated parts,  for it is the ALL. It is all that really IS.    It is beyond Matter, Force, or Mind as we know it, and yet these things  emanate from it, and must be within its nature. For what is in the  manifested must be in the manifestor--no stream can rise higher than  its source--the effect cannot be greater than the cause--you cannot get  something out of nothing.    But it is hard for the human mind to take hold of That which is beyond  its experience--many philosophers consider it impossible--and so we  must think of the Absolute in the concepts and terms of its highest  manifestation. We find Mind higher in the scale than Matter or Energy,  and so we are justified in using the terms of Mind in speaking of the  Absolute, rather than the terms of Matter or Energy--so let us try to  think of an Infinite Mind, whose powers and capacities are raised to an  infinite degree--a Mind of which Herbert Spencer said that it was \"a  mode of being as much transcending intelligence and will, as these  transcend mere mechanical motion.\"    While it is true (as all occultists know) that the best information  regarding the Absolute come from regions of the Self higher than  Intellect, yet we are in duty bound to examine the reports of the  Intellect concerning its information regarding the One. The Intellect  has been developed in us for use--for the purpose of examining,  considering, thinking--and it behooves us to employ it. By turning it  to this purpose, we not only strengthen and unfold it, but we also get  certain information that can reach us by no other channel. And  moreover, by such use of the Intellect we are able to discover many  fallacies and errors that have crept into our minds from the opinions  and dogmas of others--as Kant said: \"The chief, and perhaps the only,  use of a philosophy of pure reason is a negative one. It is not an  organon for extending, but a discipline for limiting! Instead of  discovering truth, its modest function is to guard against error.\" Let  us then listen to the report of the Intellect, as well as of the higher  fields of mentation.    One of the first reports of the Intellect, concerning the Absolute, is  that it must have existed forever, and must continue to exist forever.  There is no escape from this conclusion, whether one view the matter  from the viewpoint of the materialist, philosopher, occultist, or  theologian. The Absolute could not have sprung from Nothing, and there  was no other cause outside of itself from which it could have emanated.  And there can be no cause outside of itself which can terminate its  being. And we cannot conceive of Infinite Life, or Absolute Life,  dying. So the Absolute must be Eternal--such is the report of the  Intellect.    This idea of the Eternal is practically unthinkable to the human mind,  although it is forced to believe that it must be a quality of the  Absolute. The trouble arises from the fact that the Intellect is  compelled to see everything through the veil of Time, and Cause and  Effect. Now, Cause and Effect, and Time, are merely phenomena or  appearances of the relative world, and have no place in the Absolute  and Real. Let us see if we can understand this.    Reflection will show you that the only reason that you are unable to  think of or picture a Causeless Cause, is because everything that you  have experienced in this relative world of the senses has had a  cause--something from which it sprung. You have seen Cause and Effect  in full operation all about you, and quite naturally your Intellect has  taken it for granted that there can be nothing uncaused--nothing  without a preceding cause. And the Intellect is perfectly right, so far  as Things are concerned, for all Things are relative and are therefore  caused. But back of the caused things must lie THAT which is the Great  Causer of Things, and which, not being a Thing itself, cannot have been  caused--cannot be the effect of a cause. Your minds reel when you try  to form a mental image of That which has had no cause, because you have  had no experience in the sense world of such a thing, and there fail to  form the image. It is out of your experience, and you cannot form the  mental picture. But yet your mind is compelled to believe that there  must have been an Original One, that can have had no cause. This is a  hard task for the Intellect, but in time it comes to see just where the  trouble lies, and ceases to interpose objections to the voice of the  higher regions of the self.    And, the Intellect experiences a similar difficulty when it tries to  think of an Eternal--a That which is above and outside of Time. We see  Time in operation everywhere, and take it for granted that Time is a  reality--an actual thing. But this is a mistake of the senses. There is  no such thing as Time, in reality. Time exists solely in our minds. It  is merely a form of perception by which we express our consciousness of  the Change in Things.    We cannot think of Time except in connection with a succession of  changes of things in our consciousness--either things of the outer  world, or the passing of thought-things through our mind. A day is  merely the consciousness of the passing of the sun--an hour or minute  merely the subdivision of the day, or else the consciousness of the  movement of the hands of the clock--merely the consciousness of the  movement of Things--the symbols of changes in Things. In a world  without changes in Things, there would be no such thing as Time. Time  is but a mental invention. Such is the report of the Intellect.    And, besides the conclusions of pure abstract reasoning about Time, we  may see many instances of the relativity of Time in our everyday  experiences. We all know that when we are interested Time seems to pass  rapidly, and when we are bored it drags along in a shameful manner. We  know that when we are happy, Time develops the speed of a meteor, while  when we are unhappy it crawls like a tortoise. When we are interested  or happy our attention is largely diverted from the changes occurring  in things--because we do not notice the Things so closely. And while we  are miserable or bored, we notice the details in Things, and their  changes, until the length of time seems interminable. A tiny insect  mite may, and does, live a lifetime of birth, growth, marriage,  reproduction, old age, and death, in a few minutes, and no doubt its  life seems as full as does that of the elephant with his hundred years.  Why? _Because so many things haze happened!_ When we are conscious of  many things happening, we get the impression and sensation of the  length of time. The greater the consciousness of things, the greater  the sensation of Time. When we are so interested in talking to a loved  one that we forget all that is occurring about us, then the hours fly  by unheeded, while the same hours seem like days to one in the same  place who is not interested or occupied with some task.    Men have nodded, and in the second before awakening they have dreamed  of events that seemed to have required the passage of years. Many of  you have had experiences of this kind, and many such cases have been  recorded by science. On the other hand, one may fall asleep and remain  unconscious, but without dreams, for hours, and upon awakening will  insist that he has merely nodded. Time belongs to the relative mind,  and has no place in the Eternal or Absolute.    Next, the Intellect informs us that it "]]]
