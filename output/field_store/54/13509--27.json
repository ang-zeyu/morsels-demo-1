Because the time has come for new departures; because we need to clear  away the false notions with which the general public is constantly being  fed by one author after another; because from time to time syntheses  become necessary for the presentation of the stage reached by research.    Histories of China fall, with few exceptions, into one or the other of  two groups, pro-Chinese and anti-Chinese: the latter used to  predominate, but today the former type is much more frequently found. We  have no desire to show that China's history is the most glorious or her  civilization the oldest in the world. A claim to the longest history  does not establish the greatness of a civilization; the importance of a  civilization becomes apparent in its achievements. A thousand years ago  China's civilization towered over those of the peoples of Europe. Today  the West is leading; tomorrow China may lead again. We need to realize  how China became what she is, and to note the paths pursued by the  Chinese in human thought and action. The lives of emperors, the great  battles, this or the other famous deed, matter less to us than the  discovery of the great forces that underlie these features and govern  the human element. Only when we have knowledge of those forces and  counter-forces can we realize the significance of the great  personalities who have emerged in China; and only then will the history  of China become intelligible even to those who have little knowledge of  the Far East and can make nothing of a mere enumeration of dynasties and  campaigns.    Views on China's history have radically changed in recent years. Until  about thirty years ago our knowledge of the earliest times in China  depended entirely on Chinese documents of much later date; now we are  able to rely on many excavations which enable us to check the written  sources. Ethnological, anthropological, and sociological research has  begun for China and her neighbours; thus we are in a position to write  with some confidence about the making of China, and about her ethnical  development, where formerly we could only grope in the dark. The claim  that \"the Chinese race\" produced the high Chinese civilization entirely  by its own efforts, thanks to its special gifts, has become just as  untenable as the other theory that immigrants from the West, some  conceivably from Europe, carried civilization to the Far East. We know  now that in early times there was no \"Chinese race\", there were not even  \"Chinese\", just as there were no \"French\" and no \"Swiss\" two thousand  years ago. The \"Chinese\" resulted from the amalgamation of many separate  peoples of different races in an enormously complicated and  long-drawn-out process, as with all the other high civilizations of the  world.    The picture of ancient and medieval China has also been entirely changed  since it has been realized that the sources on which reliance has always  been placed were not objective, but deliberately and emphatically  represented a particular philosophy. The reports on the emperors and  ministers of the earliest period are not historical at all, but served  as examples of ideas of social policy or as glorifications of particular  noble families. Myths such as we find to this day among China's  neighbours were made into history; gods were made men and linked  together by long family trees. We have been able to touch on all these  things only briefly, and have had to dispense with any account of the  complicated processes that have taken place here.    The official dynastic histories apply to the course of Chinese history  the criterion of Confucian ethics; for them history is a textbook of  ethics, designed to show by means of examples how the man of high  character should behave or not behave. We have to go deeper, and try to  extract the historic truth from these records. Many specialized studies  by Chinese, Japanese, and Western scholars on problems of Chinese  history are now available and of assistance in this task. However, some  Chinese writers still imagine that they are serving their country by yet  again dishing up the old fables for the foreigner as history; and some  Europeans, knowing no better or aiming at setting alongside the  unedifying history of Europe the shining example of the conventional  story of China, continue in the old groove. To this day, of course, we  are far from having really worked through every period of Chinese  history; there are long periods on which scarcely any work has yet been  done. Thus the picture we are able to give today has no finality about  it and will need many modifications. But the time has come for a new  synthesis, so that criticism may proceed along the broadest possible  front and push our knowledge further forward.    The present work is intended for the general reader and not for the  specialist, who will devote his attention to particular studies and to  the original texts. In view of the wide scope of the work, I have had to  confine myself to placing certain lines of thought in the foreground and  paying less attention to others. I have devoted myself mainly to showing  the main lines of China's social and cultural development down to the  present day. But I have also been concerned not to leave out of account  China's relations with her neighbours. Now that we have a better  knowledge of China's neighbours, the Turks, Mongols, Tibetans, Tunguses,  Tai, not confined to the narratives of Chinese, who always speak only of  \"barbarians\", we are better able to realize how closely China has been  associated with her neighbours from the first day of her history to the  present time; how greatly she is indebted to them, and how much she has  given them. We no longer see China as a great civilization surrounded by  barbarians, but we study the Chinese coming to terms with their  neighbours, who had civilizations of quite different types but  nevertheless developed ones.    It is usual to split up Chinese history under the various dynasties that  have ruled China or parts thereof. The beginning or end of a dynasty  does not always indicate the beginning or the end of a definite period  of China's social or cultural development. We have tried to break  China's history down into the three large periods--\"Antiquity\", \"The  Middle Ages\", and \"Modern Times\". This does not mean that we compare  these periods with periods of the same name in Western history although,  naturally, we find some similarities with the development of society and  culture in the West. Every attempt towards periodization is to some  degree arbitrary: the beginning and end of the Middle Ages, for  instance, cannot be fixed to a year, because development is a continuous  process. To some degree any periodization is a matter of convenience,  and it should be accepted as such.    The account of Chinese history here given is based on a study of the  original documents and excavations, and on a study of recent research  done by Chinese, Japanese and Western scholars, including my own  research. In many cases, these recent studies produced new data or  arranged new data in a new way without an attempt to draw general  conclusions. By putting such studies together, by fitting them into the  pattern that already existed, new insights into social and cultural  processes have been gained. The specialist in the field will, I hope,  easily recognize the sources, primary or secondary, on which such new  insights represented in this book are based. Brief notes are appended  for each chapter; they indicate the most important works in English and  provide the general reader with an opportunity of finding further  information on the problems touched on. For the specialist brief hints  to international research are given, mainly in cases in which different  interpretations have been proposed.    Chinese words are transcribed according to the Wade-Giles system with  the exception of names for which already a popular way of transcription  exists (such as Peking). Place names are written without hyphen, if they  remain readable.          THE EARLIEST TIMES        Chapter One      PREHISTORY    1 _Sources for the earliest history_    Until recently we were dependent for the beginnings of Chinese history  on the written Chinese tradition. According to these sources China's  history began either about 4000 B.C. or about 2700 B.C. with a  succession of wise emperors who \"invented\" the elements of a  civilization, such as clothing, the preparation of food, marriage, and a  state system; they instructed their people in these things, and so  brought China, as early as in the third millennium B.C., to an  astonishingly high cultural level. However, all we know of the origin of  civilizations makes this of itself entirely improbable; no other  civilization"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11369"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Robin Oig had just given the preliminary \"_Hoo-hoo!_\" to urge forward  the loiterers of the drove, when there was a cry behind him.    \"Stay, Robin--bide a blink. Here is Janet of Tomahourich--auld Janet,  your father's sister.\"    \"Plague on her, for an auld Highland witch and spaewife,\" said a  farmer from the Carse of Stirling; \"she'll cast some of her cantrips  on the cattle.\"    \"She canna do that,\" said another sapient of the same  profession--\"Robin Oig is no the lad to leave any of them, without  tying Saint Mungo's knot on their tails, and that will put to her  speed the best witch that ever flew over Dimayet upon a broomstick.\"    It may not be indifferent to the reader to know, that the Highland  cattle are peculiarly liable to be _taken_, or infected, by spells and  witchcraft, which judicious people guard against by knitting knots of  peculiar complexity on the tuft of hair which terminates the animal's  tail.    But the old woman who was the object of the farmer's suspicion, seemed  only busied about the drover, without paying any attention to the  flock. Robin, on the contrary, appeared rather impatient of her  presence.    \"What auld-world fancy,\" he said, \"has brought you so early from the  ingle-side this morning, Muhme? I am sure I bid you good even, and had  your God-speed, last night.\"    \"And left me more siller than the useless old woman will use till you  come back again, bird of my bosom,\" said the sibyl. \"But it is little  I would care for the food that nourishes me, or the fire that warms  me, or for God's blessed sun itself, if aught but weal should happen  to the grandson of my father. So let me walk the _deasil_ round you,  that you may go safe out into the far foreign land, and come safe  home.\"    Robin Oig stopped, half embarrassed, half laughing, and signing to  those around that he only complied with the old woman to soothe her  humour. In the meantime, she traced around him, with wavering steps,  the propitiation, which some have thought has been derived from the  Druidical mythology. It consists, as is well known, in the person who  makes the _deasil_, walking three times round the person who is the  object of the ceremony, taking care to move according to the course  of the sun. At once, however, she stopped short, and exclaimed, in a  voice of alarm and horror, \"Grandson of my father, there is blood on  your hand.\" \"Hush, for God's sake, aunt,\" said Robin Oig; \"you will  bring more trouble on yourself with this Taishataragh (second sight)  than you will be able to get out of for many a day.\"    The old woman only repeated, with a ghastly look, \"There is blood on  your hand, and it is English blood. The blood of the Gael is richer  and redder. Let us see--let us--\"    Ere Robin Oig could prevent her, which, indeed, could only have been  by positive violence, so hasty and peremptory were her proceedings,  she had drawn from his side the dirk which lodged in the folds of his  plaid, and held it up, exclaiming, although the weapon gleamed clear  and bright in the sun, \"Blood, blood--Saxon blood again. Robin Oig  M'Combich, go not this day to England!\"    \"Prutt, trutt,\" answered Robin Oig, \"that will never do neither--it  would be next thing to running the country. For shame, Muhme--give me  the dirk. You cannot tell by the colour the difference betwixt the  blood of a black bullock and a white one, and you speak of knowing  Saxon from Gaelic blood. All men have their blood from Adam, Muhme.  Give me my skenedhu, and let me go on my road. I should have been half  way to Stirling brig by this time--Give me my dirk, and let me go.\"    \"Never will I give it to you,\" said the old woman--\"Never will I quit  my hold on your plaid, unless you promise me not to wear that unhappy  weapon.\"    The women around him urged him also, saying few of his aunt's words  fell to the ground; and as the Lowland farmers continued to look  moodily on the scene, Robin Oig determined to close it at any  sacrifice.    \"Well, then,\" said the young drover, giving the scabbard of the weapon  to Hugh Morrison, \"you Lowlanders care nothing for these freats. Keep  my dirk for me. I cannot give it you, because it was my father's; but  your drove follows ours, and I am content it should be in your  keeping, not in mine. Will this do, Muhme?\"    \"It must\", said the old woman--\"that is, if the Lowlander is mad  enough to carry the knife.\"    The strong westlandman laughed aloud.    \"Good wife,\" said he, \"I am Hugh Morrison from Glenae, come of the  Manly Morrisons of auld langsyne, that never took short weapon against  a man in their lives. And neither needed they; they had their  broadswords, and I have this bit supple (showing a formidable  cudgel)--for dirking ower the board, I leave that to John Highlandman.  Ye needna snort, none of you Highlanders, and you in especial, Robin.  I'll keep the bit knife, if you are feared for the auld spae-wife's  tale, and give it back to you whenever you want it.\"    Robin was not particularly pleased with some part of Hugh Morrison's  speech; but he had learned in his travels more patience than belonged  to his Highland constitution originally, and he accepted the service  of the descendant of the Manly Morrisons, without finding fault with  the rather depreciating manner in which it was offered.    \"If he had not had his morning in his head, and been but a  Dumfries-shire hog into the boot, he would have spoken more like a  gentleman. But you cannot have more of a sow but a grumph. It's a  shame my father's knife should ever slash a haggis for the like of  him.\"    Thus saying, (but saying it in Gaelic,) Robin drove on his cattle, and  waved farewell to all behind him. He was in the greater haste, because  he expected to join at Falkirk a comrade and brother in profession,  with whom he proposed to travel in company.    Robin Oig's chosen friend was a young Englishman, Harry Wakefield by  name, well known at every northern market, and in his way as much  famed and honoured as our Highland driver of bullocks. He was nearly  six feet high, gallantly formed to keep the rounds at Smithfield, or  maintain the ring at a wrestling-match; and although he might have  been overmatched, perhaps, among the regular professors of the Fancy,  yet as a chance customer, he was able to give a bellyful to any  amateur of the pugilistic art. Doncaster races saw him in his glory,  betting his guinea, and generally successfully; nor was there a main  fought in Yorkshire, the feeders being persons of celebrity, at which  he was not to be seen, if business permitted. But though a _sprack_  lad, and fond of pleasure and its haunts, Harry Wakefield was steady,  and not the cautious Robin Oig M'Combich himself was more attentive to  the main chance. His holidays were holidays indeed; but his days of  work were dedicated to steady and persevering labour. In countenance  and temper, Wakefield was the model of Old England's merry yeomen,  whose clothyard shafts, in so many hundred battles, asserted her  superiority over the nations, and whose good sabres, in our own time,  are her cheapest and most assured defence. His mirth was readily  excited; for, strong in limb and constitution, and fortunate in  circumstances, he was disposed to be pleased with every thing about  him; and such difficulties as he might occasionally encounter, were,  to a man of his energy, rather matter of amusement than serious  annoyance. With all the merits of a sanguine temper, our young English  drover was not without his defects. He was irascible, and sometimes to  the verge of being quarrelsome; and perhaps not the less inclined to  bring his disputes to a pugilistic decision, because he found few  antagonists able to stand up to him in the boxing-ring.    It is difficult to say how Henry Wakefield and Robin Oig first became  intimates; but it is certain a close acquaintance had taken place  betwixt them, although they had apparently few common topics of  conversation or of interest, so soon as their talk ceased to be of  bullocks. Robin Oig, indeed, spoke the English language rather  imperfectly upon any other topics but stots and kyloes, and Harry  Wakefield could never bring his broad Yorkshire tongue to utter a  single word of Gaelic. It was in vain Robin spent a whole morning,  during a walk over Minch-Moor, in attempting to teach his companion to  utter, with true precision, the shibboleth _Llhu_, which is the Gaelic  for a calf.    The pair of friends had traversed with their usual cordiality the  grassy wilds of Liddesdale, and crossed the opposite part of  Cumberland, emphatically called the Waste. In these solitary regions,  the cattle under the charge of our drovers subsisted themselves  cheaply, by picking their food as they went along the drove-road, or  sometimes by the tempting opportunity of a _start and owerloup_, or  invasion of the neighbouring pasture, where an occasion presented  itself. But now the scene changed before them; they were descending  towards a fertile and enclosed country, where no such liberties could  be taken with impunity, or without a previous arrangement and bargain  with the possessors of the ground. This was more especially the case,  as a great northern fair was upon the eve of taking place, where both  the Scotch and English drover expected to dispose of a part of their  cattle, which it was desirable to produce in the market, rested and in  good order. Fields were therefore difficult to be obtained, and only  upon high terms. This necessity occasioned a temporary separation  betwixt the two friends, who went to bargain, each as he could, for  the separate accommodation of his herd. Unhappily it chanced that both  of them, unknown to each other,"]]]
