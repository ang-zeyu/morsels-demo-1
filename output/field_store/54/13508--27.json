Following Gray, Wood, and others we have  marked each accented syllable with either the grave (`) or acute ()  accent, the former showing that the vowel over which it stands has its long  sound, while the latter indicates the short or modified sound. Let it be  remembered that any syllable with either of these marks over it is the  accented syllable, whose sound will be long or short according to the slant  of the mark.    We have appropriated from many sources such material as suited our purpose.  Our interest in ferns dates back to our college days at Amherst, when we  collected our first specimens in a rough, bushy swamp in Hadley. We found  here a fine colony of the climbing fern (_Lygodium_). We recall the slender  fronds climbing over the low bushes, unique twiners, charming, indeed, in  their native habitat. We have since collected and studied specimens of  nearly every New England fern, and have carefully examined most of the  other species mentioned in this book. By courtesy of the librarian, Mr.  William P. Rich, we have made large use of the famous Davenport herbarium  in the Massachusetts Horticultural library, and through the kindness of  the daughter, Miss Mary E. Davenport, we have freely consulted the larger  unmounted collection of ferns at the Davenport homestead, at Medford,[1]  finding here a very large and fine assortment of _Botrychiums_, including a  real _B. ternatum_ from Japan.    [Footnote 1: Recently donated to the Gray Herbarium.]    For numerous facts and suggestions we are indebted to the twenty volumes of  the _Fern Bulletin_, and also to its able editor, Mr. Willard N. Clute. To  him we are greatly obligated for the use of photographs and plates, and  especially for helpful counsel on many items. We appreciate the helpfulness  of the _American Fern Journal_ and its obliging editor, Mr. E.J. Winslow.  To our friend, Mr. C.H. Knowlton, our thanks are due for the revision of  the checklist and for much helpful advice, and we are grateful to Mr.  S.N.F. Sanford, of the Boston Society of Natural History, for numerous  courtesies; but more especially to Mr. C.A. Weatherby for his expert and  helpful inspection of the entire manuscript.    The illustrations have been carefully selected; many of them from original  negatives bequeathed to the author by his friend, Henry Lincoln Clapp,  pioneer and chief promoter of school gardens in America. Some have been  photographed from the author's herbarium, and from living ferns. A few  are from the choice herbarium of Mr. George E. Davenport, and also a few  reprints have been made from fern books, for which due credit is given. The  Scott's spleenwort, on the dedication page, is reprinted from Clute's \"Our  Ferns in Their Haunts.\"          INTRODUCTION      Thoreau tells us, \"Nature made a fern for pure leaves.\" Fern leaves are in  the highest order of cryptogams. Like those of flowering plants they are  reinforced by woody fibres running through their stems, keeping them erect  while permitting graceful curves. Their exquisite symmetry of form, their  frequent finely cut borders, and their rich shades of green combine to make  them objects of rare beauty; while their unique vernation and method of  fruiting along with their wonderful mystery of reproduction invest them  with marked scientific interest affording stimulus and culture to the  thoughtful mind. By peculiar enchantments these charming plants allure the  ardent Nature-lover to observe their haunts and habits.      \"Oh, then most gracefully they wave    In the forest, like a sea,    And dear as they are beautiful    Are these fern leaves to me.\"    As a rule the larger and coarser ferns grow in moist, shady situations, as  swamps, ravines, and damp woods; while the smaller ones are more apt to be  found along mountain ranges in some dry and even exposed locality. A tiny  crevice in some high cliff is not infrequently chosen by these fascinating  little plants, which protect themselves from drought by assuming a mantle  of light wool, or of hair and chaff, with, perhaps, a covering of white  powder as in some cloak ferns--thus keeping a layer of moist air next to  the surface of the leaf, and checking transpiration.    Some of the rock-loving ferns in dry places are known as \"resurrection\"  ferns, reviving after their leaves have turned sere and brown. A touch of  rain, and lo! they are green and flourishing.    Ferns vary in height from the diminutive filmy fern of less than an inch  to the vast tree ferns of the tropics, reaching a height of sixty feet or  more.      REPRODUCTION    Ferns are propagated in various ways. A frequent method is by perennial  rootstocks, which often creep beneath the surface, sending up, it may be,  single fronds, as in the common bracken, or graceful leaf-crowns, as in the  cinnamon fern. The bladder fern is propagated in part from its bulblets,  while the walking leaf bends over to the earth and roots at the tip.    [Illustration: MALE SHIELD FERN. Fern Reproduction by the Prothallium]    Ferns are also reproduced by spores, a process mysterious and marvellous as  a fairy tale. Instead of seeds the fern produces spores, which are little  one-celled bodies without an embryo and may be likened to buds. A  spore falls upon damp soil and germinates, producing a small, green,  shield-shaped patch much smaller than a dime, which is called a prothallium  (or prothallus). On its under surface delicate root hairs grow to give it  stability and nutriment; also two sorts of reproductive organs known as  antheridia and archegonia, the male and female growths analogous to the  stamens and pistils in flowers. From the former spring small, active,  spiral bodies called antherozoids, which lash about in the moisture of  the prothallium until they find the archegonia, the cells of which are so  arranged in each case as to form a tube around the central cell, which is  called the ooesphere, or egg-cell, the point to be fertilized. When one  of the entering antherozoids reaches this point the desired change is  effected, and the canal of the archegonium closes. The empty ooesphere  becomes the quickened ooesphore whose newly begotten plant germ unfolds  normally by the multiplication of cells that become, in turn, root, stem,  first leaf, etc., while the prothallium no longer needed to sustain its  offspring withers away.[1]    [Footnote 1: In the accompanying illustration, it should be remembered that  the reproductive parts of a fern are microscopic and cannot be seen by the  naked eye.]    Fern plants have been known to spring directly from the prothallus by a  budding process apart from the organs of fertilization, showing that Nature  \"fulfills herself in many ways.\"[2]    [Footnote 2: The scientific term for this method of reproduction is apogamy  (apart from marriage). Sometimes the prothallus itself buds directly from  the frond without spores, for which process the term apospory is used.  (Meaning, literally, without spores.)]      VERNATION    All true ferns come out of the ground head foremost, coiled up like a  watch-spring, and are designated as \"fiddle-heads,\" or crosiers. (A real  crosier is a bishop's staff.) Some of these odd young growths are covered  with \"fern wool,\" which birds often use in lining their nests. This wool  usually disappears later as the crosier unfolds into the broad green blade.  The development of plant shoots from the bud is called vernation (Latin,  _ver_ meaning spring), and this unique uncoiling of ferns, \"circinnate  vernation.\"      VEINS    The veins of a fern are free, when, branching from the mid-vein, they do  not connect with each other, and simple when they do not fork. When  the veins intersect they are said to anastomose (Greek, an opening, or  network), and their meshes are called areolae or areoles (Latin, _areola_, a  little open space).      EXPLANATION OF TERMS    A frond is said to be pinnate (Latin, _pinna_, a feather), when its primary  divisions extend to the rachis, as in the Christmas fern (Fig. 1). A frond  is bipinnate (Latin, _bis_, twice) when the lobes of the pinnae extend to  the midvein as in the royal fern (Fig. 2). These divisions of the pinnae are  called pinnules. When a frond is tripinnate the last complete divisions are  called ultimate pinnules or segments. A frond is pinnatifid when its lobes  extend halfway or more to the rachis or midvein as in the middle lobes  of the pinnatifid spleenwort (Fig. 3). The pinnae of a frond are often  pinnatifid when the frond itself is pinnate; and a frond may be pinnate  in its lower part and become pinnatifid higher up as in the pinnatifid  spleenwort just mentioned (Fig. 3).    [Illustration: Fig. 1]    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    The divisions of a pinnatifid leaf are called segments; of a bipinnatifid  or tripinnatifid leaf, ultimate segments.      SPORANGIA AND FRUIT DOTS    Fern spores are formed in little sacs known as spore-cases or sporangia  (Fig. 4). They are usually clustered in dots or lines on the back or margin  of a frond, either on or at the end of a small vein, or in spike-like  racemes on separate stalks. Sori (singular _sorus_, a heap), or fruit dots  may be naked as in the polypody, but are usually covered with a thin,  delicate membrane, known as the indusium (Greek, a dress, or mantle). The  family or genus of a fern is often determined by the shape of its indusium;  e.g., the indusium of the woodsias is star-shaped; of the Dicksonias,  cup-shaped; of the aspleniums, linear; of the wood ferns, kidney-shaped,  etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    In many ferns the sporangia are surrounded in whole or in part by a  vertical, elastic ring (annulus) reminding one of a small, brown worm  closely coiled (Fig. 4). As the spores mature, the ring contracts and  bursts with considerable force, scattering the spores.

THE ELECTIVE AFFINITIES      TRANSLATED BY JAMES ANTHONY FROUDE AND R. DILLON BOYLAN      PART I      CHAPTER I      Edward--so we shall call a wealthy nobleman in the prime of life--had  been spending several hours of a fine April morning in his  nursery-garden, budding the stems of some young trees with cuttings  which had been recently sent to him.    He had finished what he was about, and having laid his tools together in  their box, was complacently surveying his work, when the gardener came  up and complimented his master on his industry.    \"Have you seen my wife anywhere?\" inquired Edward, as he moved to go  away.    \"My lady is alone yonder in the new grounds,\" said the man; \"the  summer-house which she has been making on the rock over against the  castle is finished today, and really it is beautiful. It cannot fail to  please your grace. The view from it is perfect:--the village at your  feet; a little to your right the church, with its tower, which you can  just see over; and directly opposite you, the castle and the garden.\"    \"Quite true,\" replied Edward; \"I can see the people at work a few steps  from where I am standing.\"    \"And then, to the right of the church again,\" continued the gardener,  \"is the opening of the valley; and you look along over a range of wood  and meadow far into the distance. The steps up the rock, too, are  excellently arranged. My gracious lady understands these things; it is a  pleasure to work under her.\"    \"Go to her,\" said Edward, \"and desire her to be so good as to wait for  me there. Tell her I wish to see this new creation of hers, and enjoy it  with her.\"    The gardener went rapidly off, and Edward soon followed. Descending the  terrace, and stopping as he passed to look into the hot-houses and the  forcing-pits, he came presently to the stream, and thence, over a narrow  bridge, to a place where the walk leading to the summer-house branched  off in two directions. One path led across the churchyard, immediately  up the face of the rock. The other, into which he struck, wound away to  the left, with a more gradual ascent, through a pretty shrubbery. Where  the two paths joined again, a seat had been made, where he stopped a few  moments to rest; and then, following the now single road, he found  himself, after scrambling along among steps and slopes of all sorts and  kinds, conducted at last through a narrow more or less steep outlet to  the summer-house.    Charlotte was standing at the door to receive her husband. She made him  sit down where, without moving, he could command a view of the different  landscapes through the door and window--these serving as frames, in  which they were set like pictures. Spring was coming on; a rich,  beautiful life would soon everywhere be bursting; and Edward spoke of it  with delight.    \"There is only one thing which I should observe,\" he added, \"the  summer-house itself is rather small.\"    \"It is large enough for you and me, at any rate,\" answered Charlotte.    \"Certainly,\" said Edward; \"there is room for a third, too, easily.\"    \"Of course; and for a fourth also,\" replied Charlotte. \"For larger  parties we can contrive other places.\"    \"Now that we are here by ourselves, with no one to disturb us, and in  such a pleasant mood,\" said Edward, \"it is a good opportunity for me to  tell you that I have for some time had something on my mind, about which  I have wished to speak to you, but have never been able to muster up my  courage.\"    \"I have observed that there has been something of the sort,\" said  Charlotte.    \"And even now,\" Edward went on, \"if it were not for a letter which the  post brought me this morning, and which obliges me to come to some  resolution today, I should very likely have still kept it to myself.\"    \"What is it, then\" asked Charlotte, turning affectionately toward him.    \"It concerns our friend the Captain,\" answered Edward; \"you know the  unfortunate position in which he, like many others, is placed. It is  through no fault of his own; but you may imagine how painful it must be  for a person with his knowledge and talents and accomplishments, to find  himself without employment. I--I will not hesitate any longer with what  I am wishing for him. I should like to have him here with us for a  time.\"    \"We must think about that,\" replied Charlotte; \"it should be considered  on more sides than one.\"    \"I am quite ready to tell you what I have in view,\" returned Edward.  \"Through his last letters there is a prevailing tone of despondency; not  that he is really in any want. He knows thoroughly well how to limit his  expenses; and I have taken care for everything absolutely necessary. It  is no distress to him to accept obligations from me; all our lives we  have been in the habit of borrowing from and lending to each other; and  we could not tell, if we would, how our debtor and creditor account  stands. It is being without occupation which is really fretting him. The  many accomplishments which he has cultivated in himself, it is his only  pleasure--indeed, it is his passion--to be daily and hourly exercising  for the benefit of others. And now, to sit still, with his arms folded;  or to go on studying, acquiring, and acquiring, when he can make no use  of what he already possesses;--my dear creature, it is a painful  situation; and alone as he is, he feels it doubly and trebly.\"    \"But I thought,\" said Charlotte, \"that he had had offers from many  different quarters. I myself wrote to numbers of my own friends, male  and female, for him; and, as I have reason to believe, not without  effect.\"    \"It is true,\" replied Edward; \"but these very offers--these various  proposals--have only caused him fresh embarrassment. Not one of them is  at all suitable to such a person as he is. He would have nothing to do;  he would have to sacrifice himself, his time, his purposes, his whole  method of life; and to that he cannot bring himself. The more I think of  it all, the more I feel about it, and the more anxious I am to see him  here with us.\"    \"It is very beautiful and amiable in you,\" answered Charlotte, \"to enter  with so much sympathy into your friend's position; only you must allow  me to ask you to think of yourself and of me, as well.\"    \"I have done that,\" replied Edward. \"For ourselves, we can have nothing  to expect from his presence with us, except pleasure and advantage. I  will say nothing of the expense. In any case, if he came to us, it would  be but small; and you know he will be of no inconvenience to us at all.  He can have his own rooms in the right wing of the castle, and  everything else can be arranged as simply as possible. What shall we not  be thus doing for him! and how agreeable and how profitable may not his  society prove to us! I have long been wishing for a plan of the property  and the grounds. He will see to it, and get it made. You intend yourself  to take the management of the estate, as soon as our present steward's  term is expired; and that, you know, is a serious thing. His various  information will be of immense benefit to us; I feel only too acutely  how much I require a person of this kind. The country people have  knowledge enough, but their way of imparting it is confused, and not  always honest. The students from the towns and universities are  sufficiently clever and orderly, but they are deficient in personal  experience. From my friend, I can promise myself both knowledge and  method, and hundreds of other circumstances I can easily conceive  arising, affecting you as well as me, and from which I can foresee  innumerable advantages. Thank you for so patiently listening to me. Now,  do you say what you think, and say it out freely and fully; I will not  interrupt you.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Charlotte; \"I will begin at once with a general  observation. Men think most of the immediate--the present; and rightly,  their calling being to do and to work; women, on the other hand, more of  how things hang together in life; and that rightly too, because their  destiny--the destiny of their families--is bound up in this  interdependence, and it is exactly this which it is their mission to  promote. So now let us cast a glance at our present and our past life;  and you will acknowledge that the invitation of the Captain does not  fall in so entirely with our purposes, our plans, and our arrangements.  I will go back to those happy days of our earliest intercourse. We loved  each other, young as we then were, with all our hearts. We were parted:  you from me--your father, from an insatiable desire of wealth, choosing  to marry you to an elderly and rich lady; I from you, having to give my  hand, without any especial motive, to an excellent man, whom I  respected, if I did not love. We became again free--you first, your poor  mother at the same time leaving you in possession of your large fortune;  I later, just at the time when you returned from abroad. So we met once  more. We spoke of the past; we could enjoy and love the recollection of  it; we might have been contented, in each other's society, to leave  things as they were. You were urgent for our marriage. I at first  hesitated. We were about the same age; but I as a woman had grown older  than you as a man. At last I could not refuse you what you seemed to  think the one thing you cared for. All the discomfort which you had ever  experienced, at court, in the army, or in traveling, you were to recover  from at my side; you would settle down and enjoy life; but only with me  for your companion. I settled my daughter at a school, where she could  be more completely educated than would be possible in the retirement of  the country; and I placed my niece Ottilie there with her as well, who,  perhaps, would have grown up better at home with me, under my own care.  This was done with your consent, merely that we might have our own  lives to ourselves--merely that we might enjoy"]]]
