[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#2)"],[1,"ionism, for which several volumes like the present one would be  required. I shall only try to compile an _ensemble_ of concise and very  precise notions and statements bearing upon this vast subject. It will  be my special object to try and prove that Impressionism is neither an  isolated manifestation, nor a violent denial of the French traditions,  but nothing more or less than a logical return to the very spirit of  these traditions, contrary to the theories upheld by its detractors. It  is for this reason that I have made use of the first chapter to say a  few words on the precursors of this movement.    No art manifestation is really isolated. However new it may seem, it is  always based upon the previous epochs. The true masters do not give  lessons, because art cannot be taught, but they set the example. To  admire them does not mean to imitate them: it means the recognition in  them of the principles of originality and the comprehension of their  source, so that this eternal source may be called to life in oneself,  this source which springs from a sincere and sympathetic vision of the  aspects of life. The Impressionists have not escaped this beautiful law.  I shall speak of them impartially, without excessive enthusiasm; and it  will be my special endeavour to demonstrate in each of them the cult of  a predecessor, for there have been few artistic movements where the love  for, and one might say the hereditary link with, the preceding masters  has been more tenacious.    The Academy has struggled violently against Impressionism, accusing it  of madness, of systematic negation of the \"laws of beauty,\" which it  pretended to defend and of which it claimed to be the official priest.  The Academy has shown itself hostile to a degree in this quarrel. It has  excluded the Impressionists from the Salons, from awards, from official  purchases. Only quite recently the acceptance of the Caillebotte  bequest to the Luxembourg Gallery gave rise to a storm of indignation  among the official painters. I shall, in the course of this book, enter  upon the value of these attacks. Meanwhile I can only say how  regrettable this obstinacy appears to me and will appear to every free  spirit. It is unworthy even of an ardent conviction to condemn a whole  group of artists _en bloc_ as fools, enemies of beauty, or as tricksters  anxious to degrade the art of their nation, when these artists worked  during forty years towards the same goal, without getting any reward for  their effort, but poverty and derision. It is now about ten years since  Impressionism has taken root, since its followers can sell their  canvases, and since they are admired and praised by a solid and  ever-growing section of the public. The hour has therefore arrived,  calmly to consider a movement which has imposed itself upon the history  of French art from 1860 to 1900 with extreme energy, to leave  dithyrambics as well as polemics, and to speak of it with a view to  exactness. The Academy, in continuing the propagation of an ideal of  beauty fixed by canons derived from Greek, Latin and Renaissance art,  and neglecting the Gothic, the Primitives and the Realists, looks upon  itself as the guardian of the national tradition, because it exercises  an hierarchic authority over the _Ecole de Rome_, the _Salons_, and the  _Ecole des Beaux Arts_. All the same, its ideals are of very mixed  origin and very little French. Its principles are the same by which the  academic art of nearly all the official schools of Europe is governed.  This mythological and allegorical art, guided by dogmas and formulas  which are imposed upon all pupils regardless of their temperament, is  far more international than national. To an impartial critic this  statement will show in an even more curious light the excommunication  jealously issued by the academic painters against French artists, who,  far from revolting in an absurd spirit of _parti-pris_ against the  genius of their race, are perhaps more sincerely attached to it than  their persecutors. Why should a group of men deliberately choose to  paint mad, illogical, bad pictures, and reap a harvest of public  derision, poverty and sterility? It would be uncritical to believe  merely in a general mystification which makes its authors the worst  sufferers. Simple common sense will find in these men a conviction, a  sincerity, a sustained effort, and this alone should, in the name of the  sacred solidarity of those who by various means try to express their  love of the beautiful, suppress the annoying accusations hurled too  light-heartedly against Manet and his friends.    [Illustration: MANET    IN THE SQUARE]    I shall define later on the ideas of the Impressionists on technique,  composition and style in painting. Meanwhile it will be necessary to  indicate their principal precursors.    Their movement may be styled thus: a reaction against the Greco-Latin  spirit and the scholastic organisation of painting after the second  Renaissance and the Italo-French school of Fontainebleau, by the century  of Louis XIV., the school of Rome, and the consular and imperial taste.  In this sense Impressionism is a protest analogous to that of  Romanticism, exclaiming, to quote the old verse: \"_Qui nous delivrera  des Grecs et des Romains?_\"[1] From this point of view Impressionism has  also great affinities with the ideas of the English Pre-Raphaelites,  who stepped across the second and even the first Renaissance back to the  Primitives.    [Footnote 1: Who will deliver us from the Greeks and the Romans.]    This reaction is superimposed by another: the reaction of Impressionism,  not only against classic subjects, but against the black painting of the  degenerate Romanticists. And these two reactions are counterbalanced by  a return to the French ideal, to the realistic and characteristic  tradition which commences with Jean Foucquet and Clouet, and is  continued by Chardin, Claude Lorrain, Poussin, Watteau, La Tour,  Fragonard, and the admirable engravers of the eighteenth century down to  the final triumph of the allegorical taste of the Roman revolution. Here  can be found a whole chain of truly national artists who have either  been misjudged, like Chardin, or considered as \"small masters\" and  excluded from the first rank for the benefit of the pompous Allegorists  descended from the Italian school.    Impressionism being beyond all a technical reaction, its predecessors  should first be looked for from this material point of view. Watteau is  the most striking of all. _L'Embarquement pour Cythere_ is, in its  technique, an Impressionist canvas. It embodies the most significant  of all the principles exposed by Claude Monet: the division of tones by  juxtaposed touches of colour which, at a certain distance, produce upon  the eye of the beholder the effect of the actual colouring of the things  painted, with a variety, a freshness and a delicacy of analysis  unobtainable by a single tone prepared and mixed upon the palette.    [Illustration: MANET    YOUNG MAN IN COSTUME OF MAJO]    Claude Lorrain, and after him Carle Vernet, are claimed by the  Impressionists as precursors from the point of view of decorative  landscape arrangement, and particularly of the predominance of light in  which all objects are bathed. Ruysdael and Poussin are, in their eyes,  for the same reasons precursors, especially Ruysdael, who observed so  frankly the blue colouring of the horizon and the influence of blue upon  the landscape. It is known that Turner worshipped Claude for the very  same reasons. The Impressionists in their turn, consider Turner as one  of their masters; they have the greatest admiration for this mighty  genius, this sumptuous visionary. They have it equally for Bonington,  whose technique is inspired by the same observations as their own. They  find, finally, in Delacroix the frequent and very apparent application  of their ideas. Notably in the famous _Entry of the Crusaders into  Constantinople_, the fair woman kneeling in the foreground is painted in  accordance with the principles of the division of tones: the nude back  is furrowed with blue, green and yellow touches, the juxtaposition of  which produces, at a certain distance, an admirable flesh-tone.    And now I must speak at some length of a painter who, together with the  luminous and sparkling landscapist Felix Ziem, was the most direct  initiator of Impressionist technique. Monticelli is one of those  singular men of genius who are not connected with any school, and whose  work is an inexhaustible source of applications. He lived at Marseilles,  where he was born, made a short appearance at the Salons, and then  returned to his native town, where he died poor, ignored, paralysed and  mad. In order to live he sold his small pictures at the cafes, where  they fetched ten or twenty francs at the most. To-day they sell for  considerable prices, although the government has not yet acquired any  work by Monticelli for the public galleries. The mysterious power alone  of these paintings secures him a fame which is, alas! posthumous. Many  Monticellis have been sold by dealers as Diaz's; now they are more  eagerly looked for than Diaz, and collectors have made fortunes with  these small canvases bought formerly, to use a colloquial expression  which is here only too literally true, \"for a piece of bread.\"    Monticelli painted landscapes, romantic scenes, \"fetes galantes\" in the  spirit of Watteau, and still-life pictures: one could not imagine a more  inspired sense of colour than shown by these works which seem to be  painted with crushed jewels, with powerful harmony, and beyond all with  an unheard-of delicacy in the perception of fine shades. There are tones  which nobody had ever invented yet, a richness, a profusion, a subtlety  which almost vie with the resources of music. The fairyland atmosphere  of these works surrounds a very firm design of charming style, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#2)"],[1," himself--in a highly concentrated form. In this way a number of  interesting Europeans had been given very pleasant excursions to  America, and the society had been able to form very definite opinions  upon their teaching. And Mr. Britling was one of the representative  thinkers upon which this society had decided to inform itself. It was to  broach this invitation and to offer him the impressive honorarium by  which the society honoured not only its guests but itself, that Mr.  Direck had now come to Matching's Easy. He had already sent Mr. Britling  a letter of introduction, not indeed intimating his precise purpose, but  mentioning merely a desire to know him, and the letter had been so  happily phrased and its writer had left such a memory of pleasant  hospitality on Mr. Britling's mind during Mr. Britling's former visit to  New York, that it had immediately produced for Mr. Direck an invitation  not merely to come and see him but to come and stay over the week-end.    And here they were shaking hands.    Mr. Britling did not look at all as Mr. Direck had expected him to look.  He had expected an Englishman in a country costume of golfing tweeds,  like the Englishman in country costume one sees in American illustrated  stories. Drooping out of the country costume of golfing tweeds he had  expected to see the mildly unhappy face, pensive even to its drooping  moustache, with which Mr. Britling's publisher had for some faulty and  unfortunate reason familiarised the American public. Instead of this,  Mr. Britling was in a miscellaneous costume, and mildness was the last  quality one could attribute to him. His moustache, his hair, his  eyebrows bristled; his flaming freckled face seemed about to bristle  too. His little hazel eyes came out with a \"ping\" and looked at Mr.  Direck. Mr. Britling was one of a large but still remarkable class of  people who seem at the mere approach of photography to change their  hair, their clothes, their moral natures. No photographer had ever  caught a hint of his essential Britlingness and bristlingness. Only the  camera could ever induce Mr. Britling to brush his hair, and for the  camera alone did he reserve that expression of submissive martyrdom Mr.  Direck knew. And Mr. Direck was altogether unprepared for a certain  casualness of costume that sometimes overtook Mr. Britling. He was  wearing now a very old blue flannel blazer, no hat, and a pair of  knickerbockers, not tweed breeches but tweed knickerbockers of a  remarkable bagginess, and made of one of those virtuous socialistic  homespun tweeds that drag out into woolly knots and strings wherever  there is attrition. His stockings were worsted and wrinkled, and on his  feet were those extraordinary slippers of bright-coloured bast-like  interwoven material one buys in the north of France. These were purple  with a touch of green. He had, in fact, thought of the necessity of  meeting Mr. Direck at the station at the very last moment, and had come  away from his study in the clothes that had happened to him when he got  up. His face wore the amiable expression of a wire-haired terrier  disposed to be friendly, and it struck Mr. Direck that for a man of his  real intellectual distinction Mr. Britling was unusually short.    For there can be no denying that Mr. Britling was, in a sense,  distinguished. The hero and subject of this novel was at its very  beginning a distinguished man. He was in the _Who's Who_ of two  continents. In the last few years he had grown with some rapidity into a  writer recognised and welcomed by the more cultivated sections of the  American public, and even known to a select circle of British readers.  To his American discoverers he had first appeared as an essayist, a  serious essayist who wrote about aesthetics and Oriental thought and  national character and poets and painting. He had come through America  some years ago as one of those Kahn scholars, those promising writers  and intelligent men endowed by Auguste Kahn of Paris, who go about the  world nowadays in comfort and consideration as the travelling guests of  that original philanthropist--to acquire the international spirit.  Previously he had been a critic of art and literature and a writer of  thoughtful third leaders in the London _Times_. He had begun with a  Pembroke fellowship and a prize poem. He had returned from his world  tour to his reflective yet original corner of _The Times_ and to the  production of books about national relationships and social psychology,  that had brought him rapidly into prominence.    His was a naturally irritable mind, which gave him point and passion;  and moreover he had a certain obstinate originality and a generous  disposition. So that he was always lively, sometimes spacious, and never  vile. He loved to write and talk. He talked about everything, he had  ideas about everything; he could no more help having ideas about  everything than a dog can resist smelling at your heels. He sniffed at  the heels of reality. Lots of people found him interesting and  stimulating, a few found him seriously exasperating. He had ideas in the  utmost profusion about races and empires and social order and political  institutions and gardens and automobiles and the future of India and  China and aesthetics and America and the education of mankind in  general.... And all that sort of thing....    Mr. Direck had read a very great deal of all this expressed  opiniativeness of Mr. Britling: he found it entertaining and stimulating  stuff, and it was with genuine enthusiasm that he had come over to  encounter the man himself. On his way across the Atlantic and during  the intervening days, he had rehearsed this meeting in varying keys, but  always on the supposition that Mr. Britling was a large, quiet,  thoughtful sort of man, a man who would, as it were, sit in attentive  rows like a public meeting and listen. So Mr. Direck had prepared quite  a number of pleasant and attractive openings, and now he felt was the  moment for some one of these various simple, memorable utterances. But  in none of these forecasts had he reckoned with either the spontaneous  activities of Mr. Britling or with the station-master of Matching's  Easy. Oblivious of any conversational necessities between Mr. Direck and  Mr. Britling, this official now took charge of Mr. Direck's grip-sack,  and, falling into line with the two gentlemen as they walked towards the  exit gate, resumed what was evidently an interrupted discourse upon  sweet peas, originally addressed to Mr. Britling.    He was a small, elderly man with a determined-looking face and a sea  voice, and it was clear he overestimated the distance of his hearers.    \"Mr. Darling what's head gardener up at Claverings, _'e_ can't get sweet  peas like that, try _'ow_ 'e will. Tried everything 'e 'as. Sand  ballast, 'e's tried. Seeds same as me. 'E came along 'ere only the other  day, 'e did, and 'e says to me, 'e says, 'darned 'f I can see why a  station-master should beat a professional gardener at 'is own game,' 'e  says, 'but you do. And in your orf time, too, so's to speak,' 'e says.  'I've tried sile,' 'e says--\"    \"Your first visit to England?\" asked Mr. Britling of his guest.    \"Absolutely,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"I says to 'im, 'there's one thing you 'aven't tried,' I says,\" the  station-master continued, raising his voice by a Herculean feat still  higher.    \"I've got a little car outside here,\" said Mr. Britling. \"I'm a couple  of miles from the station.\"    \"I says to 'im, I says, ''ave you tried the vibritation of the trains?'  I says. 'That's what you 'aven't tried, Mr. Darling. That's what you  _can't_ try,' I says. 'But you rest assured that that's the secret of my  sweet peas,' I says, 'nothing less and nothing more than the vibritation  of the trains.'\"    Mr. Direck's mind was a little confused by the double nature of the  conversation and by the fact that Mr. Britling spoke of a car when  he meant an automobile. He handed his ticket mechanically to the  station-master, who continued to repeat and endorse his anecdote at the  top of his voice as Mr. Britling disposed himself and his guest in the  automobile.    \"You know you 'aven't 'urt that mud-guard, sir, not the slightest bit  that matters,\" shouted the station-master. \"I've been a looking at  it--er. It's my fence that's suffered most. And that's only strained  the post a lil' bit. Shall I put your bag in behind, sir?\"    Mr. Direck assented, and then, after a momentary hesitation, rewarded  the station-master's services.    \"Ready?\" asked Mr. Britling.    \"That's all right sir,\" the station-master reverberated.    With a rather wide curve Mr. Britling steered his way out of the station  into the highroad.      Section 4    And now it seemed was the time for Mr. Direck to make his meditated  speeches. But an unexpected complication was to defeat this intention.  Mr. Direck perceived almost at once that Mr. Britling was probably  driving an automobile for the first or second or at the extremest the  third time in his life.    The thing became evident when he struggled to get into the high gear--an  attempt that stopped the engine, and it was even more startlingly so  when Mr. Britling narrowly missed a collision with a baker's cart at a  corner. \"I pressed the accelerator,\" he explained afterwards, \"instead  of the brake. One does at first. I missed him by less than a foot.\"  The estimate was a generous one. And after that Mr. Direck became  too anxious not to distract his host's thoughts to persist with his  conversational openings. An attentive silence came upon both gentlemen  that was broken presently by a sudden outcry from Mr. Britling and a  great noise of tormented gears. \"Damn!\" cried Mr. Britling, and \"How  the _devil_?\"    Mr. Direck perceived that his host was trying to turn the car into a  very beautiful gateway, with gate-houses on either side. Then it was  manifest that Mr. Britling had"]]]
