Even for  a line-camp, he told himself disgustedly, it was \"pretty sousy.\" \"You  must be cold,\" he added, seeing her glance toward the stove. \"I'll  have a fire going right away; I've been pretty busy and just let  things slide.\" He threw the un-smoked half of his cigarette into the  ashes and felt not a quiver of regret. He knew who she was, now; she  was the daughter he had heard about, and who belonged to the place  where the stove was black and shining and the table had a red cloth  with knotted fringe. It must have been her mother whom he had seen  there--but she had looked very young to be mother of a young lady.    Charming Billy brought himself rigidly to consider the duties of a  host; swept his arm across a bench to clear it of sundry man garments,  and asked her again to sit down. When she did so, he saw that her  fingers were clasped tightly to hold her from shivering, and he raved  inwardly at his shiftlessness the while he hurried to light a fire in  the stove.    \"Too bad your horse fell,\" he remarked stupidly, gathering up the  handful of shavings he had whittled from a piece of pine board. \"I  always hate to see a horse get hurt.\" It was not what he had wanted  to say, but he could not seem to put just the right thing into words.  What he wanted was to make her feel that there was nothing out of the  ordinary in her being there, and that he was helpful and sympathetic  without being in the least surprised. In all his life on the range he  had never had a young woman walk into a line-camp at dusk--a strange  young woman who tried pitifully to be at ease and whose eyes gave the  lie to her manner--and he groped confusedly for just the right way in  which to meet the situation.    \"I know your father,\" he said, fanning a tiny blaze among the shavings  with his hat, which had been on his head until he remembered and  removed it in deference to her presence. \"But I ain't a very good  neighbor, I guess; I never seem to have time to be sociable. It's  lucky your horse fell close enough so yuh could walk in to camp; I've  had that happen to me more than once, and it ain't never pleasant--but  it's worse when there ain't any camp to walk to. I've had that happen,  too.\"    The fire was snapping by then, and manlike he swept the ashes to the  floor. The girl watched him, politely disapproving. \"I don't want to  be a trouble,\" she said, with less of constraint; for Charming Billy,  whether he knew it or not, had reassured her immensely. \"I know men  hate to cook, so when I get warm, and the water is hot, I'll cook  supper for you,\" she offered. \"And then I won't mind having you help  me to get home.\"    \"I guess it won't be any trouble--but I don't mind cooking. You--you  better set still and rest,\" murmured Charming Billy, quite red. Of  course, she would want supper--and there were dried apricots, and a  very little tapioca! He felt viciously that he could kill the Pilgrim  and be glad. The Pilgrim was already two days late with the supplies  he had been sent after because he was not to be trusted with the  duties pertaining to a line-camp--and Billy had not the wide charity  that could conjure excuses for the delinquent.    \"I'll let you wash the dishes,\" promised Miss Bridger generously. \"But  I'll cook the supper--really, I want to, you know. I won't say I'm  not hungry, because I am. This Western air does give one _such_ an  appetite, doesn't it? And then I walked miles, it seems to me; so that  ought to be an excuse, oughtn't it? Now, if you'll show me where the  coffee is--\"    She had risen and was looking at him expectantly, with a half smile  that seemed to invite one to comradeship. Charming Billy looked at her  helplessly, and turned a shade less brown.    \"The--there isn't any,\" he stammered guiltily. \"The Pilgrim--I mean  Walland--Fred Walland--\"    \"It doesn't matter in the least,\" Miss Bridger assured him hastily.  \"One can't keep everything in the house all the time, so far from any  town. We're often out of things, at home. Last week, only, I upset the  vanilla bottle, and then we were completely out of vanilla till just  yesterday.\" She smiled again confidingly, and Billy tried to seem very  sympathetic--though of a truth, to be out of vanilla did not at that  moment seem to him a serious catastrophe. \"And really, I like tea  better, you know. I only said coffee because father told me cowboys  drink it a great deal. Tea is so much quicker and easier to make.\"    Billy dug his nails into his palms. \"There--Miss Bridger,\" he blurted  desperately, \"I've got to tell yuh--there isn't a thing in the shack  except some dried apricots--and maybe a spoonful or two of tapioca.  The Pilgrim--\" He stopped to search his brain for words applicable to  the Pilgrim and still mild enough for the ears of a lady.    \"Well, never mind. We can rough it--it will be lots of fun!\" the girl  laughed so readily as almost to deceive Billy, standing there in his  misery. That a woman should come to him for help, and he not even able  to give her food, was almost unbearable. It were well for the Pilgrim  that Charming Billy Boyle could not at that moment lay hands upon him.    \"It will be fun,\" she laughed again in his face. \"If the--the  grubstake is down to a whisper (that's the way you say it, isn't it?)  there will be all the more credit coming to the cook when you see all  the things she can do with dried apricots and tapioca. May I rummage?\"    \"Sure,\" assented Billy, dazedly moving aside so that she might reach  the corner where three boxes were nailed by their bottoms to the wall,  curtained with gayly flowered calico and used for a cupboard. \"The  Pilgrim,\" he began for the third time to explain, \"went after grub  and is taking his time about getting back. He'd oughta been here day  before yesterday. We might eat his dawg,\" he suggested, gathering  spirit now that her back was toward him.    Her face appeared at one side of the calico curtain. \"I know something  better than eating the dog,\" she announced triumphantly. \"Down there  in the willows where I crossed the creek--I came down that low, saggy  place in the hill--I saw a lot of chickens or something--partridges,  maybe you call them--roosting in a tree with their feathers all puffed  out. It's nearly dark, but they're worth trying for, don't you think?  That is, if you have a gun,\" she added, as if she had begun to realize  how meagre were his possessions. \"If you don't happen to have one, we  can do all right with what there is here, you know.\"    Billy flushed a little, and for answer took down his gun and belt from  where they hung upon the wall, buckled the belt around his slim middle  and picked up his hat. \"If they're there yet, I'll get some, sure,\"  he promised. \"You just keep the fire going till I come back, and I'll  wash the dishes. Here, I'll shut the dawg in the house; he's always  plumb crazy with ambition to do just what yuh don't want him to do,  and I don't want him following.\" He smiled upon her again (he was  finding that rather easy to do) and closed the door lingeringly behind  him. Having never tried to analyze his feelings, he did not wonder why  he stepped so softly along the frozen path that led to the stable, or  why he felt that glow of elation which comes to a man only when he has  found something precious in his sight.    \"I wish I hadn't eat the last uh the flour this morning,\" he regretted  anxiously. \"I coulda made some bread; there's a little yeast powder  left in the can. Darn the Pilgrim!\"          CHAPTER II.    _Prune Pie and Coon-can._      Of a truth, Charming Billy Boyle, living his life in the wide land  that is too big and too far removed from the man-made world for any  but the strong of heart, knew little indeed of women--her kind of  women. When he returned with two chickens and found that the floor had  been swept so thoroughly as to look strange to him, and that all his  scattered belongings were laid in a neat pile upon the foot of the  bunk which was unfamiliar under straightened blankets and pitifully  plumped pillows, he was filled with astonishment. Miss Bridger smiled  a little and went on washing the dishes.    \"It's beginning to storm, isn't it?\" she remarked. \"But we'll eat  chicken stew before we--before I start home. If you have a horse that  I can borrow till morning, father will bring it back.\"    Billy scattered a handful of feathers on the floor and gained a little  time by stooping to pick them up one by one. \"I've been wondering  about that,\" he said reluctantly. \"It's just my luck not to have a  gentle hoss in camp. I've got two, but they ain't safe for women. The  Pilgrim's got one hoss that might uh done if it was here, which it  ain't.\"    She looked disturbed, though she tried to hide it. \"I can ride pretty  well,\" she ventured.    Without glancing at her, Charming Billy shook his head. \"You're all  right here\"--he stopped to pick up more feathers--\"and it wouldn't be  safe for yuh to try it. One hoss is mean about mounting; yuh couldn't  get within a rod of him. The other one is a holy terror to pitch when  anything strange gets near him. I wouldn't let yuh try it.\" Charming  Billy was sorry--that showed in his voice--but he was also firm.    Miss Bridger thoughtfully wiped a tin spoon. Billy gave her a furtive  look and dropped his head at the way the brightness had gone out of  her face. \"They'll be worried, at home,\" she said quietly.    \"A little worry beats a funeral,\" Billy retorted sententiously,  instinctively mastering the situation because she was a woman and he  must take care of her. \"I reckon I could--\" He stopped abruptly and  plucked savagely at a stubborn wing feather.    \"Of course! You could ride over and bring back a horse!\" She caught  eagerly at his half-spoken offer. \"It's a lot of bother for you, but  I--I'll be very much obliged.\" Her face was bright again.    \"You'd be alone here--\"    \"I'm not the least bit afraid to stay alone. I wouldn't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#2)"],[1,"MONUMENTS IN MONUMENT VALLEY]    [Illustration: SUNSET ON THE DESERT]    [Illustration: CAVE OF THE CLIFF DWELLERS]    Somewhere under the great bulge of Navajo Mountain I calculated that we  were coming to the edge of the plateau. The white bobbing pack-horses  disappeared and then our extra mustangs. It is no unusual thing for a  man to use three mounts on this trip. Then two of our Indians  disappeared. But Wetherill waited for us and so did Nas ta Bega, the  Piute who first took Wetherill down into Nonnezoshe Boco. As I came up I  thought we had indeed reached the end of the world.    \"It's down in there,\" said Wetherill, with a laugh.    Nas ta Bega made a slow sweeping gesture. There is always something so  significant and impressive about an Indian when he points anywhere. It  is as if he says, \"There, way beyond, over the ranges, is a place I  know, and it is far.\" The fact was that I looked at the Piute's dark,  inscrutable face before I looked out into the void.    My gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar, a vast yellow  and purple corrugated world of distance, apparently now on a level  with my eyes. I was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene;  and then I was transfixed, almost by fear, by the realization that  I dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness. I kept  looking afar, sweeping the three-quarter circle of horizon till my  judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed  one moment and magnified the next.    Wetherill was pointing and explaining, but I had not grasped all he  said.    \"You can see two hundred miles into Utah,\" he went on. \"That bright  rough surface, like a washboard, is wind-worn rock. Those little lines  of cleavage are canyons. There are a thousand canyons down there, and  only a few have we been in. That long purple ragged line is the Grand  Canyon of the Colorado. And there, that blue fork in the red, that's  where the San Juan comes in. And there's Escalante Canyon.\"    I had to adopt the Indian's method of studying unlimited spaces in the  desert--to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far.    The pack-train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope,  bare of rock, with scant strips of green, and here and there a cedar.  Half a mile down, the slope merged in what seemed a green level. But I  knew it was not level. This level was a rolling plain, growing darker  green, with lines of ravines and thin, undefined spaces that might be  mirage. Miles and miles it swept and rolled and heaved, to lose its  waves in apparent darker level. Round red rocks stood isolated.  They resembled huge grazing cattle. But as I gazed these rocks were  strangely magnified. They grew and grew into mounds, castles, domes,  crags, great red wind-carved buttes. One by one they drew my gaze  to the wall of upflung rock. I seemed to see a thousand domes of a  thousand shapes and colors, and among them a thousand blue clefts,  each of which was a canyon.    Beyond this wide area of curved lines rose another wall, dwarfing the  lower; dark red, horizon-long, magnificent in frowning boldness, and  because of its limitless deceiving surfaces incomprehensible to the  gaze of man. Away to the eastward began a winding ragged blue line,  looping back upon itself, and then winding away again, growing wider  and bluer. This line was San Juan Canyon. I followed that blue line  all its length, a hundred miles, down toward the west where it joined  a dark purple shadowy cleft. And this was the Grand Canyon of the  Colorado. My eye swept along with that winding mark, farther and  farther to the west, until the cleft, growing larger and closer,  revealed itself as a wild and winding canyon. Still farther westward  it split a vast plateau of red peaks and yellow mesas. Here the canyon  was full of purple smoke. It turned, it closed, it gaped, it lost  itself and showed again in that chaos of a million cliffs. And then it  faded, a mere purple line, into deceiving distance.    I imagined there was no scene in all the world to equal this. The  tranquillity of lesser spaces was here not manifest. This happened to  be a place where so much of the desert could be seen and the effect  was stupendous Sound, movement, life seemed to have no fitness here.  Ruin was there and desolation and decay. The meaning of the ages  was flung at me. A man became nothing. But when I gazed across that  sublime and majestic wilderness, in which the Grand Canyon was only a  dim line, I strangely lost my terror and something came to me across  the shining spaces.    Then Nas ta Bega and Wetherill began the descent of the slope, and the  rest of us followed. No sign of a trail showed where the base of the  slope rolled out to meet the green plain. There was a level bench a  mile wide, then a ravine, and then an ascent, and after that, rounded  ridge and ravine, one after the other, like huge swells of a monstrous  sea. Indian paint brush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta  of cactus. There was no sage. Soap weed and meager grass and a bunch  of cactus here and there lent the green to that barren, and it was  green only at a distance.    Nas ta Bega kept on at a steady gait. The sun climbed. The wind rose  and whipped dust from under the mustangs. There is seldom much talk  on a ride of this nature. It is hard work and everybody for himself.  Besides, it is enough just to see; and that country is conducive to  silence. I looked back often, and the farther out on the plain we rode  the higher loomed the plateau we had descended; and as I faced ahead  again, the lower sank the red-domed and castled horizon to the fore.    It was a wild place we were approaching. I saw pinon patches under  the circled walls. I ceased to feel the dry wind in my face. We were  already in the lee of a wall. I saw the rock squirrels scampering to  their holes. Then the Indians disappeared between two rounded corners  of cliff.    I rode round the corner into a widening space thick with cedars. It  ended in a bare slope of smooth rock. Here we dismounted to begin the  ascent. It was smooth and hard, though not slippery. There was not  a crack. I did not see a broken piece of stone. Nas ta Bega and  Wetherill climbed straight up for a while and then wound round a  swell, to turn this way and that, always going up. I began to see  similar mounds of rock all around me, of every shape that could be  called a curve. There were yellow domes far above and small red domes  far below. Ridges ran from one hill of rock to another. There were  no abrupt breaks, but holes and pits and caves were everywhere, and  occasionally deep down, an amphitheater green with cedar and pinon. We  found no vestige of trail on those bare slopes.    Our guides led to the top of the wall, only to disclose to us another  wall beyond, with a ridged, bare, and scalloped depression between.  Here footing began to be precarious for both man and beast. Our  mustangs were not shod and it was wonderful to see their slow, short,  careful steps. They knew a great deal better than we what the danger  was. It has been such experiences as this that have made me see in  horses something besides beasts of burden. In the ascent of the second  slope it was necessary to zigzag up, slowly and carefully, taking  advantage of every bulge and depression.    Then before us twisted and dropped and curved the most dangerous  slopes I had ever seen. We had reached the height of the divide and  many of the drops on this side were perpendicular and too steep for us  to see the bottom.    [Illustration: THIS IMMENSE CAVE WOULD HOLD TRINITY CHURCH. IN IT LIES  THE RUINED CLIFF DWELLING CALLED BETATAKIN]    At one bad place Wetherill and Nas ta Bega, with Joe Lee, a Mormon  cowboy with us, were helping one of the pack-horses named Chub. On the  steepest part of this slope Chub fell and began to slide. His momentum  jerked the rope from the hands of Wetherill and the Indian. But Joe  Lee held on. Joe was a giant and being a Mormon he could not let go of  anything he had. He began to slide with the horse, holding back with  all his might.    [Illustration: THE WIND-WORN TREACHEROUS SLOPES ON THE WAY TO  NONNEZOSHE]    It seemed that both man and beast must slide down to where the slope  ended in a yawning precipice. Chub was snorting or screaming in  terror. Our mustangs were frightened and rearing. It was not a place  to have trouble with horses.    I had a moment of horrified fascination, in which Chub turned clear  over. Then he slid into a little depression that, with Joe's hold on  the lasso, momentarily checked his descent. Quick as thought Joe ran  sidewise and down to the bulge of rock, and yelled for help. I got  to him a little ahead of Wetherill and Nas ta Bega; and together we  pulled Chub up out of danger. At first we thought he had been choked  to death. But he came to, and got up, a bloody, skinned horse, but  alive and safe. I have never seen a more magnificent effort than Joe  Lee's. Those fellows are built that way. Wetherill has lost horses on  those treacherous slopes, and that risk is the only thing about the  trip which is not splendid.    We got over that bad place without further incident, and presently  came to a long swell of naked stone that led down to a narrow green  split. This one had straight walls and wound away out of sight. It was  the head of a canyon.    \"Nonnezoshe Boco,\" said the Indian.    This then was the Canyon of the Rainbow Bridge. When we got down into  it we were a happy crowd. The mode of travel here was a selection of  the best levels, the best places to cross the brook, the best places  to climb, and it was a process of continual repetition. There was no  trail ahead of us, but we certainly left one behind. And as Wetherill  picked out the course and the mustangs followed him I had all freedom  to see and feel the beauty, color, wildness and changing character of  Nonnezoshe"]]]
