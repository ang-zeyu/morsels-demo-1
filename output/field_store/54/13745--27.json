The  English commander replied, \"I am Drake, and have no time to parley.  Don Pedro must surrender or fight.\" So Don Pedro surrendered to the  gallant captain of the _Revenge_, and lavished him with praise,  evidently glad to have fallen into the hands of so famous and generous  a foe. Drake is said to have treated his captive with elaborate  generosity, while his crew commandeered all the vast treasure. He then  sent the galleon into Dartmouth Harbour, and set off with his  prisoners to chase Medina Sidonia.    In the whole range of Drake's adventurous career there does not appear  to be any evidence of his having been possessed with the idea of  supernatural assistance, though if perchance he missed any of Philip's  treasure-ships he complacently reported \"the reason\" to those in  authority as \"being best known to God,\" and there the incident ended.  On the other hand, the Deity was no mystery to him. His belief in a  Supreme Power was real, and that he worked in harmony with It he never  doubted. When he came across anything on land or sea which he thought  should be appropriated for the benefit of his Queen and country, or  for himself and those who were associated with him in his piratical  enterprises, nothing was allowed to stand in his way, and, generally  speaking, he paralysed all resistance to his arms into submission by  an inexorable will and genius. The parsimonious Elizabeth was always  slyly willing to receive the proceeds of his dashing deeds, but never  unduly generous in fixing his share of them. She allowed her ships to  lie rotting when they should have been kept in sound and efficient  condition, and her sailors to starve in the streets and seaports.  Never a care was bestowed on these poor fellows to whom she owed so  much. Drake and Hawkins, on the other hand, saw the national danger,  and founded a war fund called the \"Chatham Chest\"; and, after great  pressure, the Queen granted L20,000 and the loan of six battleships to  the Syndicate. Happily the commercial people gave freely, as they  always do. What trouble these matchless patriots had to overcome!  Intrigue, treason, religious fanaticism, begrudging of supplies, the  constant shortage of stores and provisions at every critical stage of  a crisis, the contradictory instructions from the exasperating Tudor  Queen: the fleet kept in port until the chances of an easy victory  over England's bitterest foes had passed away! But for the vacillation  of the icy virgin, Drake's Portugal expedition would have put the  triumph of the Spanish Armada to the blush, and the great Admiral  might have been saved the anguish of misfortune that seemed to follow  his future daring adventures for Spanish treasure on land and sea  until the shadows of failure compassed him round. His spirit broken  and his body smitten with incurable disease, the fleet under his  command anchored at Puerto Bello after a heavy passage from Escudo de  Veragua, a pestilential desert island. He was then in delirium, and on  the 28th January, 1596, the big soul of our greatest seaman passed  away beyond the veil. His body was put into a lead and oak coffin and  taken a few miles out to sea, and amidst manifestations of great  sorrow he was lowered down the side and the waters covered him over.  Two useless prize ships were sunk beside him, and there they may still  lie together. The fleet, having lost their guiding spirit, weighed  anchor and shaped their course homewards.    Drake was not merely a seaman and the creator of generations of  sailors, but he was also a sea warrior of superb naval genius. It was  he who invented the magnificent plan of searching for his country's  enemies in every creek into which he could get a craft. He also imbued  Her Gracious Majesty and Her Gracious Majesty's seamen with the idea  that in warfare on sea or land it is a first principle to strike first  if you wish to gain the field and hold it. Having smashed his  antagonist, he regarded it as a plain duty in the name of God to live  on his beaten foes and seize their treasures of gold, silver,  diamonds, works of art, etc., wherever these could be laid hold of.  The First Lady of the Land was abashed at the gallant sailor's bold  piratical efforts. She would not touch the dirty, ill-gotten stuff  until the noble fellow had told her the fascinating story of his  matchless adventures and slashing successes. Doubtless the astute  Admiral had learned that his blameless Queen was only averse to  sharing with him the plunder of a risky voyage until he had assured  her again and again that her cousin, Philip of Spain, had his  voracious eye on her life, her throne, and all her British  possessions, wherever they might be.    The valiant seaman appears to have played daintily and to good effect  with the diabolical acts of the Spaniards, such as the burning of  English seamen, until they roused in Elizabeth the spirit of  covetousness and retaliation. It was easy then for her incorruptible  integrity (!) to surrender to temptation. A division of what had been  taken from Philip's subjects was forthwith piously made. Elizabeth,  being the chief of the contracting parties, took with her accustomed  grace the queenly share. On one occasion she walked in the parks with  Drake, held a royal banquet on board the notorious _Pelican_, and  knighted him; while he, in return for these little attentions,  lavished on his Queen presents of diamonds, emeralds, etc. The  accounts which have been handed down to us seem, in these days,  amazing in their cold-blooded defiance of honourable dealing. But we  must face the hard facts of the necessity of retaliation against the  revolting deeds of the Inquisition and the determined, intriguing  policy of worming Popery into the hearts of a Protestant nation, and  then we realize that Drake's methods were the \"invention\" of an  inevitable alternative either to fight this hideous despotism with  more desperate weapons and greater vigour than the languid,  luxury-loving Spaniards had taken the trouble to create or succumb to  their tremendous power of wealth and wickedness. Drake was the chosen  instrument of an inscrutable destiny, and we owe it to him that the  divided England of that day was saved from annihilation. He broke the  power of Spain at sea, and established England as the first naval and  mercantile Power in the world. He was the real founder of generations  of seamen, and his undying fame will inspire generations yet unborn to  maintain the supremacy of the seas.    The callous, brutal attitude of Elizabeth towards a race of men who  had given their lives and souls so freely in every form of danger and  patriotic adventure because they believed it to be a holy duty is one  of the blackest pages of human history. The cruelties of the Spanish  Inquisition and the treatment of sailors in the galleys were only  different in degree, and while there are sound reasons for condemning  the Queen and the ruling classes of that time for conduct that would  not be tolerated in these days, it is unquestionably true that it was  a difficult task to keep under control the spirit of rebellion of that  period, as it is to-day. Doubtless those in authority were, in their  judgment, compelled to rule with a heavy hand in order to keep in  check wilful breaches of discipline.    Attempts to mutiny and acts of treason were incidents in the wonderful  career of Francis Drake which frequently caused him to act with  severity. Doughty, the Spanish spy, who was at one time a personal  friend of Drake's, resolved to betray his commander. Doughty was  caught in the act, tried by a court composed of men serving under  Drake, found guilty, and after dining with the Admiral, chatting  cheerfully as in their friendly days, they drank each other's health  and had some private conversation not recorded; then Doughty was led  to the place of execution and had his head chopped off, Drake  exclaiming as it fell, \"Lo, this is the end of traitors!\" Then Drake  relieved Fletcher of his duties as chaplain by telling him softly that  he would \"preach this day.\" The ship's company was called together and  he exhorted them to harmony, warning them of the danger of discord.  Then in his breezy phraseology he exclaims, \"By the life of God, it  doth even take my wits from me to think of it.\" The crew, it appears,  was composed of gentlemen, who were obviously putting on airs, and  sailors, who resented their swank as much as did the great captain. So  Drake proceeds to lay the law down vehemently. \"Let us show  ourselves,\" said he, \"all to be of one company, and let us not give  occasion to the enemy to rejoice at our decay and overthrow. Show me  the man that would refuse to set his hand to a rope, but I know that  there is not any such here.\" Then he proceeds to drive home his plan  of discipline with vigour. \"And as gentlemen are necessary for  government's sake in the voyage, so I have shipped them to that and to  some further intent.\" He does not say quite what it is, but they  doubtless understand that it is meant to be a warning lest he should  be compelled to put them through some harsh form of punishment. He  concludes his memorable address with a few candid words, in which he  declares that he knows sailors to be the most envious people in the  world and, in his own words, \"unruly without government,\" yet, says  he, \"May I not be without them!\" It is quite clear that Drake would  have no class distinction. His little sermon sank deep into the souls  of his crew, so that when he offered the _Marigold_ to those who had  lost heart, to take them back to England, he had not only made them  ashamed of their refractory conduct, but imbued them with a new  spirit, which caused them to vie with each other in professions of  loyalty and eagerness to go on with him and comply with all the  conditions of the enterprise.

It is  believed, however, that this study need not exclude, or essentially  interfere with, any of the studies pursued in the schools generally. By  the more advanced scholars in the common schools, the work may be used  as a reading book, and thus a two-fold advantage be gained from its use.    To assist the more inexperienced teachers in conducting the exercise, a  few questions have been appended to the chapters. Questions may be added  by the teachers at pleasure, or to such extent as may be thought  necessary. And it is believed the recitations may be made more  profitable to pupils, by requiring them, so far as may be, to give  answers in their own words. To some of the printed questions, no answers  are furnished by the chapters and sections referred to, but may be found  in the Synopsis of the State Constitutions, or other parts of the work.

Principles of Government.          Chapter I.    Mankind fitted for Society, and for Civil Government and Laws.        Sec.1. Mankind are social beings. They are by nature fitted for society. By  this we mean that they are naturally disposed to associate with each  other. Indeed, such is their nature, that they could not be happy  without such association. Hence we conclude that the Creator has  designed men for society. It can not, therefore, be true, as some say,  that the savage state is the natural state of man.    Sec.2. Man is so formed that he is dependent upon his fellow men. He has  not the natural strength of other animals. He needs the assistance of  creatures like himself to protect and preserve his own being. We can  hardly imagine how a person could procure the necessaries of life  without such assistance. But men have the gifts of reason and speech. By  conversation they are enabled to improve their reason and increase their  knowledge, and to find methods of supplying their wants, and of  improving their social condition.    Sec.3. But, although men need the assistance of each other, they are so  formed that each must have the care of himself. If every man were fed  and clothed from a common store, provided by the labor of all, many,  depending upon the labor of others, would be less industrious than they  now are. By the present arrangement in society, which obliges every man  to provide for his own wants, more is earned, a greater number are cared  for, and the general welfare is better promoted than would be done if  each labored for the benefit of all.      Sec.4. From this arrangement comes the right of property. If each man's  earnings should go into a common stock for the use of all, there would  be nothing that any one could call his own. But if each is to provide  for himself, he must have a right to use and enjoy the fruits of his own  labor.    Sec.5. But all men in society have the same rights. Therefore, in laboring  to supply our wants, and to gratify our desires, we can not rightfully  do so any further than is consistent with the rights of others. Hence we  see the necessity of some established rules for securing to every member  of society the free enjoyment of what justly belongs to him, and for  regulating his conduct toward his"]]]
