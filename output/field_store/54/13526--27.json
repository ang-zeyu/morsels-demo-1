He was a fine, big, bold, hearty Englishman,  with a bald head, grizzled locks, a loud but not harsh voice, a rather  quick temper, and a kind, earnest, enthusiastic heart. Like Buzzby, he  had spent nearly all his life at sea, and had become so thoroughly  accustomed to walking on an unstable foundation that he felt quite  uncomfortable on solid ground, and never remained more than a few months  at a time on shore. He was a man of good education and gentlemanly  manners, and had worked his way up in the merchant service step by step  until he obtained the command of a West India trader.    A few years previous to the period in which our tale opens, an event  occurred which altered the course of Captain Ellice's life, and for a  long period plunged him into the deepest affliction. This was the loss  of his wife at sea under peculiarly distressing circumstances.    At the age of thirty Captain Ellice had married a pretty blue-eyed girl,  who resolutely refused to become a sailor's bride unless she should be  permitted to accompany her husband to sea. This was without much  difficulty agreed to, and forthwith Alice Bremner became Mrs. Ellice,  and went to sea. It was during her third voyage to the West Indies that  our hero Fred was born, and it was during this and succeeding voyages  that Buzzby became \"all but a wet-nurse\" to him.    Mrs. Ellice was a loving, gentle, seriously-minded woman. She devoted  herself, heart and soul to the training of her boy, and spent many a  pleasant hour in that little, unsteady cabin in endeavouring to instil  into his infant mind the blessed truths of Christianity, and in making  the name of Jesus familiar to his ear. As Fred grew older his mother  encouraged him to hold occasional intercourse with the sailors--for her  husband's example taught her the value of a bold, manly spirit, and she  knew that it was impossible for her to instil _that_ into him--but she  was careful to guard him from the evil that he might chance to learn  from the men, by committing him to the tender care of Buzzby. To do the  men justice, however, this was almost unnecessary, for they felt that a  mother's watchful eye was on the child, and no unguarded word fell from  their lips while he was romping about the forecastle.    When it was time for Fred to go to school, Mrs. Ellice gave up her  roving life and settled in her native town of Grayton, where she resided  with her widowed sister, Amelia Bright, and her niece Isobel. Here Fred  received the rudiments of an excellent education at a private academy.  At the age of twelve, however, Master Fred became restive, and during  one of his father's periodical visits home, begged to be taken to sea.  Captain Ellice agreed; Mrs. Ellice insisted on accompanying them; and in  a few weeks they were once again on their old home, the ocean, and Fred  was enjoying his native air in company with his friend Buzzby, who stuck  to the old ship like one of her own stout timbers.    But this was destined to be a disastrous voyage. One evening, after  crossing the line, they descried a suspicious-looking schooner to  windward, bearing down upon them under a cloud of canvas.    \"What do you think of her, Buzzby?\" inquired Captain Ellice, handing  his glass to the seaman.    Buzzby gazed in silence and with compressed lips for some time; then he  returned the glass, at the same time muttering the word, \"Pirate.\"    \"I thought so,\" said the captain in a deep, unsteady voice. \"There is  but one course for us, Buzzby,\" he continued, glancing towards his wife,  who, all unconscious of their danger, sat near the taffrail employed  with her needle; \"these fellows show no mercy, because they expect none  either from God or man. We must fight to the last. Go, prepare the men  and get out the arms. I'll tell my wife.\"    Buzzby went forward; but the captain's heart failed him, and he took two  or three rapid, hesitating turns on the quarter-deck ere he could make  up his mind to speak.    \"Alice,\" he said at length abruptly, \"yonder vessel is a pirate.\"    Mrs. Ellice looked up in surprise, and her face grew pale as her eye met  the troubled gaze of her husband.    \"Are you quite sure, Frederick?\"    \"Yes, quite. Would God that I were left alone to--but--nay, do not be  alarmed; perhaps I am wrong, it may be a--a clipper-built  trading-vessel. If not, Alice, we must make some show of fighting, and  try to frighten them. Meanwhile you must go below.\"    The captain spoke encouragingly as he led his wife to the cabin; but his  candid countenance spoke too truthfully, and she felt that his look of  anxious concern bade her fear the worst.    Pressing her fervently to his heart, Captain Ellice sprang on deck.    By this time the news had spread through the ship, and the crew,  consisting of upwards of thirty men, were conversing earnestly in knots  of four or five while they sharpened and buckled on cutlasses, or loaded  pistols and carbines.    \"Send the men aft, Mr. Thompson,\" said the captain, as he paced the deck  to and fro, casting his eyes occasionally on the schooner, which was  rapidly nearing the vessel. \"Take another pull at these  main-topsail-halyards, and send the steward down below for my sword and  pistols. Let the men look sharp; we've no time to lose, and hot work is  before us.\"    \"I will go for your sword, father,\" cried Fred, who had just come on  deck.    \"Boy, boy, you must go below; you can be of no use here.\"    \"But, father, you know that I'm not _afraid_.\"    \"I know that, boy--I know it well; but you're too young to fight--you're  not strong enough. Besides, you must comfort and cheer your mother; she  may want you.\"    \"I'm old enough and strong enough to load and fire a pistol, father; and  I heard one of the men say we would need all the hands on board, and  more if we had them. Besides, it was my mother who told me what was  going on, and sent me on deck to _help you, to fight._\"    A momentary gleam of pride lit up the countenance of the captain as he  said hastily, \"You may stay, then,\" and turned towards the men, who now  stood assembled on the quarter-deck.    Addressing the crew in his own blunt, vigorous style, he said, \"Lads,  yon rascally schooner is a pirate, as you all know well enough. I need  not ask you if you are ready to fight; I see by your looks you are. But  that's not enough--you must make up your minds to fight _well_. You know  that pirates give no quarter. I see the decks are swarming with men. If  you don't go at them like bull-dogs, you'll walk the plank before sunset  every man of you. Now, go forward, and double-shot your muskets and  pistols, and stick as many of the latter into your belts as they will  hold. Mr. Thompson, let the gunner double-shot the four big guns, and  load the little carronade with musket-balls to the muzzle. If they do  try to board us, they'll get a warm reception.\"    \"There goes a shot, sir,\" said Buzzby, pointing towards the piratical  schooner, from the side of which a white cloud burst, and a round shot  ricochetted over the sea, passing close ahead of the ship.    \"Ay, that's a request for us to lay-to,\" said the captain bitterly, \"but  we won't. Keep her away a point.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" sung out the man at the wheel. A second and a third shot  were fired, but passed unheeded, and the captain, fully expecting that  the next would be fired into them, ordered the men below.    \"We can't afford to lose a man, Mr. Thompson; send them all down.\"    \"Please, sir, may I remain?\" said Buzzby, touching his hat.    \"Obey orders,\" answered the captain sternly. The sailor went below with  a sulky fling.    For nearly an hour the two vessels cut through the water before a steady  breeze, during which time the fast-sailing schooner gradually overhauled  the heavy West Indiaman, until she approached within speaking distance.  Still Captain Ellice paid no attention to her, but stood with compressed  lips beside the man at the wheel, gazing alternately at the sails of his  vessel and at the windward horizon, where he fancied he saw indications  that led him to hope the breeze would fail ere long.    As the schooner drew nearer, a man leaped on the hammock-nettings, and,  putting a trumpet to his mouth, sang out lustily, \"Ship ahoy! where are  you from, and what's your cargo?\"    Captain Ellice made no reply, but ordered four of his men on deck to  point one of the stern-chasers.    Again the voice came harshly across the waves, as if in passion, \"Heave  to, or I'll sink you.\" At the same moment the black flag was run up to  the peak, and a shot passed between the main and fore masts.    \"Stand by to point this gun,\" said the captain in a subdued voice.    \"Ay, ay, sir!\"    \"Fetch a red-hot iron; luff, luff a little--a little more steady--so.\"  At the last word there was a puff and a roar, and an iron messenger flew  towards the schooner. The gun had been fired more as a reply of  defiance to the pirate than with the hope of doing him any damage; but  the shot had been well aimed--it cut the schooner's main-sail-yard in  two and brought it rattling down on deck. Instantly the pirate yawed and  delivered a broadside; but in the confusion on deck the guns were badly  aimed, and none took effect. The time lost in this manoeuvre, added to  the crippled condition of the schooner, enabled the West Indiaman to  gain considerably on her antagonist; but the pirate kept up a  well-directed fire with his bow-chasers, and many of the shots struck  the hull and cut the rigging seriously. As the sun descended towards the  horizon the wind fell gradually, and ceased at length altogether, so  that both vessels lay rolling on the swell with their sails flapping  idly against the masts.    \"They're a-gittin' out the boats, sir,\" remarked John Buzzby, who,  unable to restrain himself any longer, had crept upon deck at the risk  of another reprimand; \"and, if "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#2)"],[1,"a perception of the error, if any of the  words are misspelled, misjoined, misapplied,--or are, in any way,  unfaithful to the sense intended.    Thus it is the great end of grammar, to secure the power of apt expression,  by causing the principles on which language is constructed, if not to be  constantly present to the mind, at least to pass through it more rapidly  than either pen or voice can utter words. And where this power resides,  there cannot but be a proportionate degree of critical skill, or of ability  to judge of the language of others. Present what you will, grammar directs  the mind immediately to a consideration of the sense; and, if properly  taught, always creates a discriminating taste which is not less offended by  specious absurdities, than by the common blunders of clownishness. Every  one who has any pretensions to this art, knows that, to _parse_ a sentence,  is but to resolve it according to one's understanding of its import; and it  is equally clear, that the power to _correct_ an erroneous passage, usually  demands or implies a knowledge of the author's thought.    But, if parsing and correcting are of so great practical importance as our  first mention of them suggests, it may be well to be more explicit here  concerning them. The pupil who cannot perform these exercises both  accurately and fluently, is not truly prepared to perform them at all, and  has no right to expect from any body a patient hearing. A slow and  faltering rehearsal of words clearly prescribed, yet neither fairly  remembered nor understandingly applied, is as foreign from parsing or  correcting, as it is from elegance of diction. Divide and conquer, is the  rule here, as in many other cases. Begin with what is simple; practise it  till it becomes familiar; and then proceed. No child ever learned to speak  by any other process. Hard things become easy by use; and skill is gained  by little and little. Of the whole method of parsing, it should be  understood, that it is to be a critical exercise in utterance, as well as  an evidence of previous study,--an exhibition of the learner's attainments  in the practice, as well as in the theory, of grammar; and that, in any  tolerable performance of this exercise, there must be an exact adherence to  the truth of facts, as they occur in the example, and to the forms of  expression, which are prescribed as models, in the book. For parsing is, in  no degree, a work of invention; but wholly an exercise, an exertion of  skill. It is, indeed, an exercise for all the powers of the mind, except  the inventive faculty. Perception, judgement, reasoning, memory, and  method, are indispensable to the performance. Nothing is to be guessed at,  or devised, or uttered at random. If the learner can but rehearse the  necessary definitions and rules, and perform the simplest exercise of  judgement in their application, he cannot but perceive what he _must say_  in order to speak the truth in parsing. His principal difficulty is in  determining the parts of speech. To lessen this, the trial should commence  with easy sentences, also with few of the definitions, and with definitions  that have been perfectly learned. This difficulty being surmounted, let him  follow the forms prescribed for the several praxes of this work, and he  shall not err. The directions and examples given at the head of each  exercise, will show him exactly the number, the order, and the proper  phraseology, of the particulars to be stated; so that he may go through the  explanation with every advantage which a book can afford. There is no hope  of him whom these aids will not save from \"plunging into chaos.\"    \"Of all the works of man, language is the most enduring, and partakes the  most of eternity. And, as our own language, so far as thought can project  itself into the future, seems likely to be coeval with the world, and to  spread vastly beyond even its present immeasurable limits, there cannot  easily be a nobler object of ambition than to purify and better  it.\"--_Philological Museum_, Vol. i, p. 665.    It was some ambition of the kind here meant, awakened by a discovery of the  scandalous errors and defects which abound in all our common English  grammars, that prompted me to undertake the present work. Now, by the  bettering of a language, I understand little else than the extensive  teaching of its just forms, according to analogy and the general custom of  the most accurate writers. This teaching, however, may well embrace also,  or be combined with, an exposition of the various forms of false grammar by  which inaccurate writers have corrupted, if not the language itself, at  least their own style in it.    With respect to our present English, I know not whether any other  improvement of it ought to be attempted, than the avoiding and correcting  of those improprieties and unwarrantable anomalies by which carelessness,  ignorance, and affectation, are ever tending to debase it, and the careful  teaching of its true grammar, according to its real importance in  education. What further amendment is feasible, or is worthy to engage  attention, I will not pretend to say; nor do I claim to have been competent  to so much as was manifestly desirable within these limits. But what I  lacked in ability, I have endeavored to supply by diligence; and what I  could conveniently strengthen by better authority than my own, I have not  failed to support with all that was due, of names, guillemets, and  references.    Like every other grammarian, I stake my reputation as an author, upon \"a  certain set of opinions,\" and a certain manner of exhibiting them,  appealing to the good sense of my readers for the correctness of both. All  contrary doctrines are unavoidably censured by him who attempts to sustain  his own; but, to grammatical censures, no more importance ought to be  attached than what belongs to grammar itself. He who cares not to be  accurate in the use of language, is inconsistent with himself, if he be  offended at verbal criticism; and he who is displeased at finding his  opinions rejected, is equally so, if he cannot prove them to be well  founded. It is only in cases susceptible of a rule, that any writer can be  judged deficient. I can censure no man for differing from me, till I can  show him a principle which he ought to follow. According to Lord Kames, the  standard of taste, both in arts and in manners, is \"the common sense of  mankind,\" a principle founded in the universal conviction of a common  nature in our species. (See _Elements of Criticism_, Chap, xxv, Vol. ii, p.  364.) If this is so, the doctrine applies to grammar as fully as to any  thing about which criticism may concern itself.    But, to the discerning student or teacher, I owe an apology for the  abundant condescension with which I have noticed in this volume the works  of unskillful grammarians. For men of sense have no natural inclination to  dwell upon palpable offences against taste and scholarship; nor can they be  easily persuaded to approve the course of an author who makes it his  business to criticise petty productions. And is it not a fact, that  grammatical authorship has sunk so low, that no man who is capable of  perceiving its multitudinous errors, dares now stoop to notice the most  flagrant of its abuses, or the most successful of its abuses? And, of the  quackery which is now so prevalent, what can be a more natural effect, than  a very general contempt for the study of grammar? My apology to the reader  therefore is, that, as the honour of our language demands correctness in  all the manuals prepared for schools, a just exposition of any that are  lacking in this point, is a service due to the study of English grammar, if  not to the authors in question.    The exposition, however, that I have made of the errors and defects of  other writers, is only an incident, or underpart, of the scheme of this  treatise. Nor have I anywhere exhibited blunders as one that takes delight  in their discovery. My main design has been, to prepare a work which, by  its own completeness and excellence, should deserve the title here chosen.  But, a comprehensive code of false grammar being confessedly the most  effectual means of teaching what is true, I have thought fit to supply this  portion of my book, not from anonymous or uncertain sources, but from the  actual text of other authors, and chiefly from the works of professed  grammarians.    \"In what regards the laws of grammatical purity,\" says Dr. Campbell, \"the  violation is much more conspicuous than the observance.\"--See _Philosophy  of Rhetoric_, p. 190. It therefore falls in with my main purpose, to  present to the public, in the following ample work, a condensed mass of  special criticism, such as is not elsewhere to be found in any language.  And, if the littleness of the particulars to which the learner's attention  is called, be reckoned an objection, the author last quoted has furnished  for me, as well as for himself, a good apology. \"The elements which enter  into the composition of the hugest bodies, are subtile and inconsiderable.  The rudiments of every art and science exhibit at first, to the learner,  the appearance of littleness and insignificancy. And it is by attending to  such reflections, as to a superficial observer would appear minute and  hypercritical, that language must be improved, and eloquence  perfected.\"--_Ib._, p. 244.
