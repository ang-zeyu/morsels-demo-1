The key to understanding Jesus is  man, even as Jesus is the key to God. One must use both keys to get into  the inner heart of God. To get hold of that first key one must go back to  the start of things. The old Book of God opens with a picture that is  fascinating in its simplicity and strength. There is an unfallen man. He  is fresh from the hand of God, free of scar and stain and shrivelling  influence. He is in a garden. He is walking hand in hand with God, and  working side by side with God: friendship and partnership. Friends in  spirit: partners in service.    The distinctive thing about the man is that he is _like God_. He and God  are alike. In this he differs from all creation. He is God's link between  Himself and His Creation. Particular pains is taken by repetition and  change of phrase to make clear and emphatic that it was in the very image  of God that man was made. Just what does it mean that we men were made in  God's likeness? Well, the thing has been discussed back and forth a good  bit. Probably we will not know fully till we know as we are known. In the  morning when we see Him we shall be like Him fully again. Then we'll know.  _That_ morning's sun will clear up a lot of fog. But a few things can be  said about it now with a positiveness that may clear the air a bit, and  help us recognize the dignity of our being, and behave accordingly.    Man came into being by the breath of God. God breathed Himself into man.  The breath that God breathed out came into man as life. The very life of  man is a bit of God. Man is of the essence of God. Every man is the  presence-chamber of God.    God is a _Spirit. Man_ is a spirit. He lives in a body. He thinks through  a mind. He _is_ a spirit, using the body as a dwelling-place, and the  mind as his keenest instrument. All the immeasurable possibilities and  capacities of spirit being are in man.    God is an _infinite_ spirit. That is, we cannot understand Him fully. He  is very close to us. The relationship is most intimate, and tender, yet  His fulness is ever beyond our grasp and our ken. _Man_ is infinite in  that he knows that God is infinite. Only like can appreciate like. He can  appreciate that he cannot appreciate God, except in part. He understands  that he does not understand God save in smaller part. He knows enough to  love passionately. And through loving as well as through knowing he knows  that there is infinitely more that he does not know. Only man of all  earth's creation knows this. In this he is like God. The difference  between God and man here is in the degree of infinity. That degree of  difference is an infinite degree. Yet this is the truth. But more yet: man  has this same quality _man_ward. He is infinite in that he cannot be fully  understood in his mental processes and motives. He is beyond grasp fully  by his fellow. Even one's most intimate friend who knows most and best  must leave unknown more than is known.    God is an _eternal_ spirit. He has always lived. He will live always. He  knows no end, at either end. All time before there was time, and after the  time-book is shut, is to Him a passing present. _Man_ is an eternal  spirit, because of God. He will know no end. He will live always because  the breath of God is his very being.    God is _love_. He yearns for love. He loves. And more, He _is_ love. Man  is like God in his yearning for love, in his capacity for love, and in his  lovableness. Man must love. He lives only as he loves. True love, and only  that, is the real life. He will give up everything for love. He is  satisfied only as he loves and finds love. To love is greater than to be  loved. One cannot always have both. God does not. But every one may love.  Every one does love. And only as there is love, pure and true--however  overlaid with what is not so--only so is there life.    God is _holy_. That word seems to include purity and righteousness. There  is utter absence of all that should not be. There is in Him all that  should be, and that in fulness beyond our thinking. Man was made holy.  There is in the Genesis picture of Eden a touch that for simplicity and  yet for revealing the whole swing of moral action is most vivid. In the  presence of conditions where man commonly, universally, the world around,  and time through, has been and is _most sensitive to suggestion of evil_  there is with this first man the utter absence of any thought of evil.[1]  In the light of after history there could be no subtler, stronger  statement than this of his holiness, his purity, at this stage.    And in his _capacity for holiness_, in that intensest longing for purity,  and loathing of all else, that comes as the Spirit of God is allowed  sway, is revealed again the capacity for God-likeness. It is the prophetic  dawn within of that coming Eden when again we shall _see His face_, and  have the original likeness fully restored.    God is _wise_, all-wise. Among the finest passages of the' Christian's  classic are those that represent God as personified wisdom. And here  wisdom includes all knowledge and justice. That the Spirit of God breathed  into man His own mental life is stated most keenly by the man who  proverbially embodied in himself this quality of wisdom. \"The spirit of  man is the lamp of the Lord searching out the innermost parts.\" The  allusion is clearly to intellectual powers. There is in man the same  quality of mental keenness that searches into things as is in God. It is  often dulled, gripped by a sort of stupor, so overlaid you would hardly  guess it was there. But, too, as we all know, it often shines out with a  startling brilliance. It is less in degree than with God, but it is the  same thing, a bit of God in man. This explains man's marvellous  achievements in literature, in invention, in science, and in organization.    Two light master-strokes of the etching point in the Eden picture reveal  the whole mental equipment of the man. The only sayings of Adam's  preserved for us are when God brought to him the woman. She is the  occasion for sayings that reveal the mental powers of this first man.  Fittingly it is so. Woman, when true to herself, has ever been the  occasion for bringing out the best in man. \"And the man said, _this time_  it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; _this_ shall be called  woman, because out of man was this one taken. Therefore doth a man leave  his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife, and they become one  flesh.\" ... \"And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the  mother of all living.\" Here is revealed at a glance the keen mental powers  at work. Here is the simplicity of statement that marks the speech of  strong men. The whole forest is in a single acorn. The whole of a human  life is in the primal cell. The chemist knows the whole body by looking  into one drop of blood. Here is revealed in one glance the whole man. Mark  the keen sense of fitness in the naming of woman--the last and highest  creation. Adam was a philologist. His mind was analytical. Inferentially  the same keen sense of fitness guided in all the names he had chosen. Here  is recognition of the plan for the whole race, a simple unlabored  foresight into its growth. A man's relation to his wife, his God-chosen  friend, as being the closest of life, and above all others is recognized,  together with the consequent obligation upon him. She comes first of all.  She becomes the first of all his relationships. The man and the woman--one  man and one woman--united, make the true unit of society. Any disturbance  of that strikes at the very vitals of society.    And God is a _Sovereign_--_the_ sovereign of the vast swing of worlds.  _Man_ likewise is a sovereign in the realm of nature, and over all the  lower creation. He was given dominion, kingship, over all the  earth-creation. Man is a king. He is of the blood royal. He was made to  command, to administrate, to reign. He is the judge of last appeals on the  bench of earth.    But there is more here. The chief characteristic of an absolute sovereign  is the imperial power to choose, to decide. Man was made an absolute  sovereign in his own will. God is the absolute sovereign. He has made man  an absolute sovereign in one realm, that of his will, his power of choice.  There is one place where man reigns alone, an absolute autocrat, where not  even God _can_ come save as the autocrat desires it, that is in his will.  And if that \"_can_\" bother you, remember that it was God's sovereign act  that made it so. So that God remains sovereign in making man a sovereign  in the realm of his will. There every man sits in imperial solitude.    Here then is the picture of man fresh from the hand of God. A spirit, in a  body, with an unending life, partly infinite, like God in his capacity for  love, for holiness, and wisdom, with the gift of sovereignty over the  lower creation, and in his own will. Like Him too in his capacity for  _fellowship_ with God. For only like can have fellowship with like. It is  only in that in which we are alike that we can have fellowship. These two,  God and man, walking side by side, working together, friendship in spirit;  partnership in service.    This man is in a _garden_ of trees and bushes, with fruit and flowers and  singing birds, roses with no pricking thorns, soft green with no weeds,  and no poison ivy, for there is no hate. And he is walking with God,  talking familiarly as chosen friend with choicest friend. Together they  work in the completion of creation. God brings His created beings one by  one to man to be catalogued and named, and accepts his decisions. What a  winsome picture. These two, God and a man in His likeness, walking and  working side by side; likeness in being; friendship, fellowship in spirit;  partnership, comradeship in service.

It was only for an instant, however, and then we were plunged  again into the inky darkness of a tropical jungle.    We had planned to reach the distant Tinguian village in the late  afternoon, but had failed to reckon with the deliberateness of native  carriers. It was only by urging our horses that we were able to  ford the broad Abra ere the last rays of the sun dropped behind the  mountains. And then, in this land of no twilights, night had settled  quickly over us.    We had made our way up the mountain-side, through the thick jungle,  only to find that the trail, long imperceptible to us, had escaped  even the keen eyes of our guide. For several hours we wandered about,  lost in the darkness.    On and on we went, through narrow paths, steep in places, and made  rough and dangerous by sharp rocks as well as by those long creepers  of the jungle whose thorny fingers are ever ready to seize horse or  rider. Occasionally we came out of the forest, only to cross rocky  mountain streams; or perhaps it was the same stream that we crossed  many times. Our horses, becoming weary and uncertain of foot, grew more  and more reluctant to plunge into the dark, swiftly flowing water. And  our patience was nearly exhausted when we at last caught sight of  dim lights in the valley below. Half an hour later we rode into Manabo.    I shall never forget that first picture. It was a weird  spectacle. Coming out of the darkness, we were almost convinced that  we had entered a new world. Against the blackness of the night,  grass-roofed houses stood outlined in the dim light of a bonfire;  and squatting around that fire, unclad save for gay blankets wrapped  about their shoulders, were brown-skinned men smoking long pipes,  while women bedecked with bright beads were spinning cotton. As they  worked in the flickering light, they stretched their distaffs at  arm's length into the air like witches waving their wands; and with  that the elfland picture was complete.    In the stillness of the night a single voice could be heard reciting  some tale in a singsong tone, which was interrupted only when peals  of laughter burst forth from the listeners, or when a scrawny dog rose  to bark at an imaginary noise until the shouts of the men quieted him  and he returned to his bed in the warm ashes. Later we learned that  these were the regular social gatherings of the Tinguian, and every  night during the dry season one or more of these bonfires were to be  seen in the village.    After we had attained to the footing of welcome guests in these  circles, we found that a good story-teller was always present,  and, while the men smoked, the women spun, and the dogs slept,  he entertained us with tales of heroes who knew the magic of the  betel-nut, or with stories of spirits and their power over the lives  of men.    The following are some of the tales heard first around the camp fire  of the distant mountain village.        Aponibolinayen and the Sun    _Tinguian_    One day Aponibolinayen and her sister-in-law went out to gather  greens. They walked to the woods to the place where the siksiklat grew,  for the tender leaves of this vine are very good to eat. Suddenly while  searching about in the underbrush, Aponibolinayen cried out with joy,  for she had found the vine, and she started to pick the leaves. Pull  as hard as she would, however, the leaves did not come loose, and all  at once the vine wound itself around her body and began carrying her  upward. [1]    Far up through the air she went until she reached the sky, and there  the vine set her down under a tree. Aponibolinayen was so surprised  to find herself in the sky that for some time she just sat and looked  around, and then, hearing a rooster crow, she arose to see if she  could find it. Not far from where she had sat was a beautiful spring  surrounded by tall betel-nut trees whose tops were pure gold. Rare  beads were the sands of the spring, and the place where the women set  their jars when they came to dip water was a large golden plate. As  Aponibolinayen stood admiring the beauties of this spring, she beheld  a small house nearby, and she was filled with fear lest the owner  should find her there. She looked about for some means of escape and  finally climbed to the top of a betel-nut tree and hid.    Now the owner of this house was Ini-init, [2] the Sun, but he was  never at home in the daylight, for it was his duty to shine in the  sky and give light to all the world. At the close of the day when  the Big Star took his place in the sky to shine through the night,  Ini-init returned to his house, but early the next morning he was  always off again.    From her place in the top of the betel-nut tree, Aponibolinayen saw  the Sun when he came home at evening time, and again the next morning  she saw him leave. When she was sure that he was out of sight she  climbed down and entered his dwelling, for she was very hungry. She  cooked rice, and into a pot of boiling water she dropped a stick  which immediately became fish, [3] so that she had all she wished to  eat. When she was no longer hungry, she lay down on the bed to sleep.    Now late in the afternoon Ini-init returned from his work and went  to fish in the river near his house, and he caught a big fish. While  he sat on the bank cleaning his catch, he happened to look up toward  his house and was startled to see that it appeared to be on fire. [4]  He hurried home, but when he reached the house he saw that it was  not burning at all, and he entered. On his bed he beheld what looked  like a flame of fire, but upon going closer he found that it was a  beautiful woman fast asleep.    Ini-init stood for some time wondering what he should do, and then  he decided to cook some food and invite this lovely creature to eat  with him. He put rice over the fire to boil and cut into pieces the  fish he had caught. The noise of this awakened Aponibolinayen, and  she slipped out of the house and back to the top of the betel-nut  tree. The Sun did not see her leave, and when the food was prepared  he called her, but the bed was empty and he had to eat alone. That  night Ini-init could not sleep well, for all the time he wondered who  the beautiful woman could be. The next morning, however, he rose as  usual and set forth to shine in the sky, for that was his work.    That day Aponibolinayen stole again to the house of the Sun and cooked  food, and when she returned to the betel-nut tree she left rice and  fish ready for the Sun when he came home. Late in the afternoon  Ini-init went into his home, and when he found pots of hot rice  and fish over the fire he was greatly troubled. After he had eaten  he walked a long time in the fresh air. \"Perhaps it is done by the  lovely woman who looks like a flame of fire,\" he said. \"If she comes  again I will try to catch her.\"    The next day the Sun shone in the sky as before, and when the afternoon  grew late he called to the Big Star to hurry to take his place, for he  was impatient to reach home. As he drew near the house he saw that it  again looked as if it was on fire. He crept quietly up the ladder, and  when he had reached the top he sprang in and shut the door behind him.    Aponibolinayen, who was cooking rice over the fire, was surprised and  angry that she had been caught; but the Sun gave her betel-nut [5]  which was covered with gold, and they chewed together and told each  other their names. Then Aponibolinayen took up the rice and fish,  and as they ate they talked together and became acquainted.    After some time Aponibolinayen and the Sun were married, and every  morning the Sun went to shine in the sky, and upon his return at night  he found his supper ready for him. He began to be troubled, however,  to know where the food came from, for though he brought home a fine  fish every night, Aponibolinayen always refused to cook it.    One night he watched her prepare their meal, and he saw that, instead  of using the nice fish he had brought, she only dropped a stick into  the pot of boiling water.    \"Why do you try to cook a stick?\" asked Ini-init in surprise.    \"So that we can have fish to eat,\" answered his wife.    \"If you cook that stick for a month, it will not be soft,\" said  Ini-init. \"Take this fish that I caught in the net, for it will  be good.\"    But Aponibolinayen only laughed at him, and when they were ready to  eat she took the cover off the pot and there was plenty of nice soft  fish. The next night and the next, Aponibolinayen cooked the stick,  and Ini-init became greatly troubled for he saw that though the stick  always supplied them with fish, it never grew smaller.    Finally he asked Aponibolinayen again why it was that she cooked the  stick instead of the fish he brought, and she said:    \"Do you not know of the woman on earth who has magical power and can  change things?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the Sun, \"and now I know that you have great power.\"    \"Well, then,\" said his wife, \"do not ask again why I cook the stick.\"    And they ate their supper of rice and the fish which the stick made.    One night not long after this Aponibolinayen told her husband that  she wanted to go with him the next day when he made light in the sky.    \"Oh, no, you cannot,\" said the Sun, \"for it is very hot up there,  [6] and you cannot stand the heat.\"    \"We will take many blankets and pillows,\" said the woman, \"and when  the heat becomes very great, I will hide under them.\"    Again and again Ini-init begged her not to go, but as often she  insisted on accompanying him, and early in the morning they set out,  carrying with them many blankets and pillows.    First, they went to the East, and as soon as they arrived the Sun"]]]
