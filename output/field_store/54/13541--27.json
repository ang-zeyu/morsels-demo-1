[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#2)"],[1,"present  information about Krishna in the form in which it has actually reached  Indian minds and has influenced belief and worship. During the last two  thousand years, various texts have dealt with Krishna, emphasizing first  one and then another aspect of his character and in the process assembling  more and more details. These texts are still revered by Indians and  although they are the product of widely separated eras, all of them have  still an air of contemporary authority. By considering them in historical  sequence, we can understand not only the subject-matter of romantic Indian  painting but realize why Krishna, the adored lover, should still enchant  religious India.    [Footnote 1: Note 1.]    [Footnote 2: Note 2.]          II      THE _MAHABHARATA_: KRISHNA THE HERO    The first reference to Krishna occurs in the _Chandogya Upanishad_ of  perhaps the sixth century B.C. _Upanishads_ were 'forest sittings' or  'sessions with teachers.' Sages and their disciples discussed the nature  of life and strove to determine the soul's exact relationship to God. The  starting-point was the theory of re-incarnation. Death, it was believed,  did not end the soul. Death was merely a stepping-stone to another life,  the soul moving from existence to existence in one long effort to escape  re-birth. From this cycle, only one experience could bring release and  that was consciousness or actual knowledge of the supreme Spirit. When  that state was achieved, the soul blended with the Godhead and the cycle  ended. The problem of problems, therefore, was how to attain such  knowledge. The _Chandogya Upanishad_ does not offer any startling solution  to this matter. The teacher who conducts the session is a certain Ghora of  the Angirasa family and it is the person of his disciple rather than his  actual message which concerns us. The disciple is called Krishna and his  mother has the name Devaki. Devaki is the later Krishna's mother and there  is accordingly every reason to suppose that the two Krishnas are the same.  Nothing, however, is stated of this early Krishna's career and although  parts of the sage's teachings have been compared to passages in the  _Gita_,[3] Krishna himself remains a vague and dim name.    For the next few centuries, knowledge of Krishna remains in this  fragmentary state. Nothing further is recorded and not until the great  Indian epic, the _Mahabharata_, crystallizes out between the fourth  century B.C. and the fourth century A.D. does a more detailed Krishna make  his appearance.[4] By the end of this period, many vital changes had taken  place. The Indian world-view had become much clearer and it is possible  not only to connect Krishna with a definite character but to see him in  clear relation to cosmic events. The supreme Spirit was now envisaged as a  single all-powerful God, known according to his functions as Brahma,  Vishnu and Siva. As Brahma, he brought into existence three  worlds--heaven, earth and the nether regions--and also created gods or  lesser divinities, earth and nature spirits, demons, ogres and men  themselves. Siva, for his part, was God the final dissolver or destroyer,  the source of reproductive energy and the inspirer of asceticism. He was  thought of in many forms--as a potent ascetic, a butcher wild for blood, a  serene dancer--and in his character of regenerator was represented by his  symbol, the _lingam_ or phallus. The third aspect, Vishnu, was God in his  character of loving protector and preserver. This great Trinity was  ultimately supreme but under it were a number of lesser powers. Those that  represented the forces of good were called _devas_ or gods. They were led  by their king, Indra, lord of clouds, and associated with him were gods  such as Agni (fire), Varuna (water), Surya the sun and Kama the god of  passion. These gods lived in Indra's heaven, a region above the world but  lower than Vaikuntha, the heaven of Vishnu. Dancing-girls and musicians  lived with them and the whole heaven resembled a majestic court on earth.  From this heaven the gods issued from time to time intervening in human  affairs. Demons, on the other hand, were their exact opposites. They  represented powers of evil, were constantly at war with the gods and took  vicious pleasure in vexing or annoying the good. Below gods and demons  were men themselves.    In this three-tiered universe, transmigration of souls was still the basic  fact but methods of obtaining release were now much clearer. A man was  born, died and then was born again. If he acted well, did his duty and  worked ceaselessly for good, he followed what was known as the path of  _dharma_ or righteousness. This ensured that at each succeeding birth he  would start a stage more favourably off than in his previous existence  till, by sheer goodness of character, he qualified for admission to  Indra's heaven and might even be accounted a god. The achievement of this  status, however, did not complete his cycle, for the ultimate goal still  remained. This was the same as in earlier centuries--release from living  by union with or absorption into the supreme Spirit; and only when the  individual soul had reached this stage was the cycle of birth and re-birth  completed. The reverse of this process was illustrated by the fate of  demons. If a man lapsed from right living, his second state was always  worse than his first. He might then be born in humble surroundings or if  his crimes were sufficiently great, he became a demon. As such, his  capacity for evil was greatly increased and his chances of ultimate  salvation correspondingly worsened. Yet even for demons, the ultimate goal  was the same--release from living and blissful identification with the  Supreme.    _Dharma_ alone, however, could not directly achieve this end. This could  be done by the path of _yoga_ or self-discipline--a path which involved  penances, meditation and asceticism. By ridding his mind of all desires  and attachments, by concentrating on pure abstractions, the ascetic  'obtained insight which no words could express. Gradually plumbing the  cosmic mystery, his soul entered realms far beyond the comparatively  tawdry heavens where the great gods dwelt in light and splendour. Going  \"from darkness to darkness deeper yet,\" he solved the mystery beyond all  mysteries; he understood, fully and finally, the nature of the universe  and of himself and he reached a realm of truth and bliss, beyond birth and  death. And with this transcendent knowledge came another realization--he  was completely, utterly, free. He had found ultimate salvation, the final  triumph of the soul.'[5] Such a complete identification with the supreme  Spirit, however, was not easily come by and often many existences were  required before the yogi could achieve this sublime end.    There remained a third way--the path of _bhakti_ or devotion to God. If a  man loved God not as an abstract spirit but as a loving Person, if he  loved with intensity and singleness of heart, adoration itself might  obtain for him the same reward as a succession of good lives. Vishnu as  protector might reward love with love and confer immediately the blessing  of salvation.    The result, then, was that three courses were now open to a man and  whether he followed one or other depended on his own particular cast of  mind, the degree of his will-power, the strength of his passions and  finally, his capacity for renunciation, righteousness and love. On these  qualifications the upshot would largely depend. But they were not the only  factors. Since gods and demons were part of the world, a man could be  aided or frustrated according as gods or demons chose to intervene. Life  could, in fact, be viewed from two angles. On the one hand it was one long  effort to blend with the Godhead--an effort which only the individual  could make. On the other hand, it was a war between good and evil, gods  and demons; and to such a contest, God as Vishnu could not remain  indifferent. While the forces of evil might properly be allowed to test or  tax the good, they could never be permitted completely to win the day.  When, therefore, evil appeared to be in the ascendant, Vishnu intervened  and corrected the balance. He took flesh and entering the world, slew  demons, heartened the righteous and from time to time conferred salvation  by directly exempting individuals from further re-births.    It is these beliefs which govern the _Mahabharata_ epic and provide the  clue to Krishna's role. Its prime subject is a feud between two families,  a feud which racks and finally destroys them. At the same time, it is very  much more. Prior to the events narrated in the text, Vishnu has already  undergone seven incarnations, taking the forms of a fish, tortoise, boar  and man-lion and later those of Vamana the dwarf, Parasurama ('Rama with  the Axe'), and finally, the princely Rama. In each of these incarnations  he has intervened and, for the time being, rectified the balance. During  the period covered by the epic, he undergoes an eighth incarnation and it  is in connection with this supremely vital intervention that Krishna  appears.    To understand the character which now unfolds, we must briefly consider  the central story of the _Mahabharata_. This is narrated in the most  baffling and stupendous detail. Cumbrous names confront us on every side  while digressions and sub-plots add to the general atmosphere of confusion  and complexity. It is idle to hope that this vast panorama can arouse  great interest in the West and even in India it is unlikely that many  would now approach its gigantic recital with premonitions of delight. It  is rather as a necessary background that its main outlines must be  grasped, for without them Krishna's character and career can hardly be  explained.    The epic begins with two rival families each possessed of a common  ancestor, Kuru, but standing in bitter rivalry to each other.

He thought he would tell her that already he had  more Books at Home than he could get on the Shelves, but when he tried  to Talk he only Yammered. She Kept on with her little Song, and Smiled  all the Time, and sat a little Closer, and he got so Dizzy he had to  lock his Legs under the Office Chair to keep from Sinking Away.    [Illustration: GRASS WIDOW]    When she had him in the Hypnotic State she pushed the Silver Pencil into  his Right Hand, and showed him where to sign his Name. He wrote it,  while the dim Sub-Consciousness told him that probably he was the  Softest Thing the Lady Robber had Stood Up that Season. Then she  recovered the Pencil, which he was confusedly trying to put into his  Vest Pocket, and missing it about Six Inches, and with a cheery Good By  she was gone.    He shook himself and took a Long Breath, and asked where he was. Then it  all came back to him and he felt Ornery, and called himself Names and  roasted the Office Boy in the Next Room, and made a Rule that hereafter  Nobody could get at him except by Card, and if any Blonde Sharks in  Expensive Costumes asked for him, to call up the Chief and ask for a  Squad.    [Illustration: THE OFFICE BOY]    He was so Wrothy at himself for being Held Up that he could not find any  Consolation except in the Fact that he had seen on the List of  Subscribers the name of nearly every well-known married Citizen above  the Age of 35. He was not the Only One. She had Corralled the Street.    When the Man came around to deliver the seven-pound copy of \"Happy Hours  with the Poets,\" and he paid out his Six Silver Pieces for a queer  Volume that he would not have Read for Six an Hour, he hated himself  worse than ever. He thought some of giving the Book to the Office Boy,  by way of Revenge, but he hit upon a Better Use for it. He put it back  into the Box and carried it Home, and said to his Wife, \"See what I have  Bought for you.\"    It occurred to him that after getting a Present like that, she ought to  let him stay out every Night for a Month. But she could not see it that  Way. He had to tell her that Some Women never seem to Appreciate having  Husbands to Grind and Toil all day, so as to be able to purchase  Beautiful Gifts for them. Then she told him that all the Women of her  Acquaintance had received these Books as Presents, and a crowd of  Married Men must have been given a Club Rate. Then he Spunked up and  said that if she was going to look a Gift Horse in the Mouth, they  wouldn't Talk about it any more.    In the meantime the Grass Widow was living at the Waldorf-Astoria.    MORAL: _Those who are Entitled to it Get it sooner or later_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ HONEST MONEY-MAKER AND THE PARTNER OF HIS JOYS,  _SUCH AS THEY WERE_      The Prosperous Farmer lived in an Agricultural Section of the Middle  West. He commanded the Respect of all his Neighbors. He owned a Section,  and had a Raft of big Horses and white-faced Cows and Farm Machinery,  and Money in the Bank besides. He still had the first Dollar he ever  made, and it could not have been taken away from him with Pincers.    Henry was a ponderous, Clydesdale kind of Man, with Warts on his Hands.  He did not have to travel on Appearances, because the whole County knew  what he was Worth. Of course he was Married. Years before he had  selected a willing Country Girl with Pink Cheeks, and put her into his  Kitchen to serve the Remainder of her Natural Life. He let her have as  high as Two Dollars a Year to spend for herself. Her Hours were from 6  A.M. to 6 A.M., and if she got any Sleep she had to take it out of her  Time. The Eight-Hour Day was not recognized on Henry's Place.    [Illustration: HENRY]    After Ten Years of raising Children, Steaming over the Washtub, Milking  the Cows, Carrying in Wood, Cooking for the Hands, and other Delsarte  such as the Respected Farmer usually Frames Up for his Wife, she was as  thin as a Rail and humped over in the Shoulders. She was Thirty, and  looked Sixty. Her Complexion was like Parchment and her Voice had been  worn to a Cackle. She was losing her Teeth, too, but Henry could not  afford to pay Dentist Bills because he needed all his Money to buy more  Poland Chinas and build other Cribs. If she wanted a Summer Kitchen or a  new Wringer or a Sewing Machine, or Anything Else that would lighten her  Labors, Henry would Moan and Grumble and say she was trying to land him  in the Poorhouse.    They had a dandy big Barn, painted Red With White Trimmings, and a  Patent Fork to lift the Hay into the Mow, and the Family lived in a Pine  Box that had not been Painted in Years and had Dog-Fennel all around the  Front of it.    The Wife of the Respected Farmer was the only Work Animal around the  Place that was not kept Fat and Sleek. But, of course, Henry did not  count on Selling her. Henry often would fix up his Blooded Stock for the  County Fair and tie Blue Ribbons on the Percherons and Herefords, but it  was never noticed that he tied any Blue Ribbons on the Wife.    And yet Henry was a Man to be Proud of. He never Drank and he was a Good  Hand with Horses, and he used to go to Church on Sunday Morning and hold  a Cud of Tobacco in his Face during Services and sing Hymns with Extreme  Unction. He would sing that he was a Lamb and had put on the Snow-White  Robes and that Peace attended him. People would see him there in his  Store Suit, with the Emaciated Wife and the Scared Children sitting in  the Shadow of his Greatness, and they said that she was Lucky to have a  Man who was so Well Off and lived in the Fear of the Lord.    Henry was Patriotic as well as Pious. He had a Picture of Abraham  Lincoln in the Front Room, which no one was permitted to Enter, and he  was glad that Slavery had been abolished.    Henry robbed the Cradle in order to get Farm-Hands. As soon as the  Children were able to Walk without holding on, he started them for the  Corn-Field, and told them to Pay for the Board that they had been  Sponging off of him up to that Time. He did not want them to get too  much Schooling for fear that they would want to sit up at Night and Read  instead of Turning In so as to get an Early Start along before Daylight  next Morning. So they did not get any too much, rest easy. And he never  Foundered them on Stick Candy or Raisins or any such Delicatessen for  sale at a General Store. Henry was undoubtedly the Tightest Wad in the  Township. Some of the Folks who had got into a Box through Poor  Management, and had been Foreclosed out of House and Home by Henry and  his Lawyer, used to say that Henry was a Skin, and was too Stingy to  give his Family enough to Eat, but most People looked up to Henry, for  there was no getting around it that he was Successful.    [Illustration: THE FARM]    When the Respected Farmer had been Married for Twenty Years and the  Children had developed into long Gawks who did not know Anything except  to get out and Toil all Day for Pa and not be paid anything for it, and  after Henry had scraped together more Money than you could load on a  Hay-Rack, an Unfortunate Thing happened. His Wife began to Fail. She was  now Forty, but the Fair and Fat did not go with it. At that Age some  Women are Buxom and just blossoming into the Full Charm of Matronly  Womanhood. But Henry's Wife was Gaunt and Homely and all Run Down. She  had been Poorly for Years, but she had to keep up and do the Chores as  well as the House-Work, because Henry could not afford to hire a Girl.  At last her Back gave out, so that she had to sit down and Rest every  Once in a While. Henry would come in for his Meals and to let her know  how Hearty all the Calves seemed to be, and he began to Notice that she  was not very Chipper. It Worried him more than a little, because he did  not care to pay any Doctor Bills. He told her she had better go and get  some Patent Medicine that he had seen advertised on the Fence coming out  from Town. It was only Twenty-Five cents a Bottle, and was warranted to  Cure Anything. So she tried it, but it did not seem to restore her Youth  and she got Weaker, and at last Henry just had to have the Doctor,  Expense or No Expense. The Doctor said that as nearly as he could  Diagnose her Case, she seemed to be Worn Out. Henry was Surprised, and  said she had not been Complaining any more than Usual.    Next Afternoon he was out Dickering for a Bull, and his Woman, lying on  the cheap Bedstead, up under the hot Roof, folded her lean Hands and  slipped away to the only Rest she had known since she tied up with a  Prosperous and Respected Farmer.    [Illustration: THE FAMILY]    Henry was all Broken Up. He Wailed and Sobbed and made an Awful Fuss at  the Church. The Preacher tried to Comfort him by saying that the Ways of  Providence were beyond all Finding Out. He said that probably there was  some Reason why the Sister had been taken right in the Prime of her  Usefulness, but it was not for Henry to know it. He said the only  Consolation he could offer was the Hope that possibly she was Better  Off. There did not seem to be much Doubt about that.    In about a Month the Respected Farmer was riding around the Country in  his Buck-Board looking for Number Two. He had a business Head and he  knew it was Cheaper to Marry than to Hire one. His Daughter was only  Eleven and not quite Big Enough as yet to do all the Work for five Men.    Finally he found one who had the Reputation of being a Good Worker. When  he took her over to his House to Break Her In, the Paper at the County  Seat referred to them as the Happy Couple.
