If these steps  are taken carefully and quickly the method in most cases will be  successful with such acid products as I mentioned. As the products  will have to be cooked before they can be used many housewives do not  consider it any saving of time or labor to follow this method.      THE COLD-PACK METHOD    The method of to-day that came into its own during the war is known as  the \"cold-pack\" method of canning. It fought a long fight to prove  that it was a very efficient, economical and satisfactory process for  busy housewives to can everything that grows.    This is the method that I shall mostly refer to in this book, and if I  should omit the phrase \"cold-pack\" you will know that I am referring  to it. \"Cold-pack\" simply means that the products are packed cold in  their fresh and natural state in the glass jars or containers. To the  fruits hot sirup is applied; to the vegetables hot water and a little  salt are added. The sterilization is done in the glass jars or tin  containers after they are partly or entirely sealed, making it  practically impossible for bacteria or spores to enter after the  product has once been carefully sterilized or cooked. In following  this method vegetables should first be blanched in boiling water or  live steam, then quickly plunged into cold water and the skins  removed. The products are then packed in containers and sterilized  according to the instructions and recipes given later.    When we use the term sterilizing we simply mean cooking the product  for a certain period of time after the jar has been filled with food.  It is sometimes called processing. Sterilizing, processing, boiling  and cooking are all interchangeable terms and mean one and the same  thing.    By this \"cold-pack,\" or cold-fill, method of canning, all food  products, including fruits, vegetables and meats, can be successfully  sterilized in a single period with but one handling of the product in  and out of the canner.    All the flavor is retained, the product is not cooked to a mushy pulp,  and the labor and time needed for the canning are less than in any  other method. The housewife's canning enemy, mold, is eliminated and  all bacteria and bacterial spores which cause vegetables and meat to  spoil are destroyed.      EXPENSIVE OUTFITS NOT ESSENTIAL    For this \"cold-pack\" method you can use whatever equipment you have in  the kitchen. Complicated equipment is not essential. Many of us have  purchased commercial outfits, for we know we can turn out more at the  end of a day and have found it well worth while to invest a few  dollars in equipment that enabled us to be more efficient. But if you  are a beginner and do not care to put any money in an unknown venture  use the available things at hand, just to prove to yourself and others  that it can be done.    Every type of glass jar manufactured can be used except those which  are sealed with wax. So dig into your storerooms, attics and basements  and bring forth all your old jars. If a top is in good condition and  will make a perfect seal when adjusted with a good rubber you can use  that jar.    If the tops cannot be restored to good condition it is poor economy to  use them. Imperfectly sealed jars are probably responsible for more  spoiled canned goods than any other cause. Good tops and good rubbers  are requisites for good canning.    For your canner, or sterilizer, you may use a wash boiler or a  galvanized bucket, such as is used for a garbage pail--a new one, of  course. Either is excellent where the family is small and the canning  is accordingly light. Some use the reservoir of the cookstove while  others employ a large vat. If you should have to buy the wash boiler  or pail see that it has a tight-fitting cover and be sure the pail  does not leak. Then all you have to do is to secure what we call a  false bottom, something that will keep the jars of fruit from touching  the direct bottom of the boiler or pail. This false bottom, remember,  is absolutely necessary, for without it the jars will break during the  boiling.    For this false bottom use a wire netting of half-inch mesh and cut it  to fit the bottom of the sterilizer, whether boiler, pail or bucket.  If you haven't any netting and do not care to purchase it a wooden  bottom can be made to fit the sterilizer, or if that is not available  put thin pieces of wood in the bottom--anything to keep the jars from  coming in direct contact with the bottom of the sterilizer.    If you have only a small quantity of berries or fruit to can use a  deep saucepan with a tight-fitting cover and a few slats of wood. This  rack is absolutely necessary to keep the contents of the jars from  becoming overheated. Even if they should not break there is a tendency  for part of the contents to escape under the cover and be lost. Do not  use hay, old clothes, newspapers or excelsior for a false bottom; they  are unsatisfactory because they do not allow proper circulation of  water.    Individual jar holders are very convenient and are preferred by many  women to the racks. Inexpensive racks with handles are on the market  and are worth what they cost in saved nerves and unburned fingers.  Some hold eight jars, others hold twelve. So it just lies with you,  individual housekeeper, whether you want a rack that will hold all  your jars or a set of individual holders that handles them separately.    To return to the subject of the canner, let me add that no matter what  kind you use, it must be at least three inches deeper than the tallest  jar. This will give room for the rack and an extra inch or two so that  the water will not boil over.    Besides the canners, the jars, the rubber rings and the rack you will  need one kettle for boiling water, into which the product may be put  for scalding or blanching; another kettle for water--if you haven't  running water--for the \"cold dip.\"    If you use a homemade rack without handles you should have a jar  lifter of some kind for placing in and removing jars from the canner.  If individual holders are used this is not necessary, as they contain  an upright bail. Some women use a wire potato masher for lifting the  jars out of the canners. Other kitchen equipment, such as scales,  knives, spoons, wire basket or a piece of cheesecloth or muslin for  blanching or scalding the product, and the kitchen clock play their  part in canning.    No canning powder or any preservative is needed. If the product is  cooked in closed jars in the hot-water bath as directed the food will  be sterilized so that it will keep indefinitely. If it is desired to  add salt, sugar, sirup, vinegar or other flavor this may be done when  the product is packed in the jar.    A great many people have been led to believe through advertising  matter that it is both safe and practical to use canning compounds for  the preserving of vegetables which have proved hard to keep under the  commonly known methods of canning. The first argument against the use  of a canning compound is that it is unnecessary. It is possible to  sterilize any fruit or vegetable which grows on tree, vine, shrub or  in the ground by this cold-pack, single-period method of canning,  without the use of a compound. The second argument against it is that  many of the canning compounds are positively harmful to health. Some  of them contain as high as ninety-five per cent of boric acid.  Directors of county and state fairs should exclude from entry all  fruits and vegetables that have been preserved in any canning  compound. Perfect fruit can be produced without any chemical  preservative. The third argument is that they are expensive.    There are many modifications of the original wash boiler and garbage  pail cookers. These are all known as the hot-water-bath outfits. In  these outfits the products are all cooked in boiling water.    There are condensed-steam cookers under various names, where the  product is cooked in condensed steam. These steamers are generally  used for everyday cookery.    The water-seal outfit, the steam-pressure outfit and the aluminum  pressure cooker follow in order of efficiency as regards the time  required to sterilize food.    Following the hot-water canner in simplicity of construction and  manipulation is the water-seal cooker. The temperature of the  hot-water-seal outfit is a little higher than the homemade or  hot-water-bath outfit; so time is saved in the sterilizing.    The steam-pressure and the pressure cookers are more complicated but  more efficient. Some prefer the aluminum pressure cooker because it  can be used for everyday cooking in the home.    Pressure cookers are expensive, but they are worth their price, as  they are used daily and not just during the canning season.    Here are examples of how they rank as to time required: In a  hot-water-bath outfit soft fruits must be sterilized sixteen minutes;  in a steamer, sixteen minutes; in a water-seal outfit, twelve minutes;  in a steam-pressure-outfit under five pounds of steam, ten minutes; in  an aluminum pressure cooker outfit with ten pounds of steam, five  minutes.    It takes longest to can with a homemade or hot-water-bath outfit; the  shortest and quickest method is with the pressure cooker that has a  pressure of ten pounds or more. Each housewife has different financial  problems, different hours of working and different ways of working.  Where quick work is desired and expense is no item the pressure cooker  is advisable; where money is scarce and time is no object the homemade  outfit answers. Each one must decide which outfit is best for her own  particular case. It matters not which outfit you have--they have all  been thoroughly tested and approved by experts. Each one does the  work.    This"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13789"],[0,"Great Britain and the American Civil War (#2)"],[1,"of the last two centuries. It is  the single case in which the English Government and public--generally so  meddlesome--have displayed most prudent and commendable forbearance in  spite of great temptations to the contrary[2].\" And Sir William  Harcourt, in September, 1863, declared: \"Among all Lord Russell's many  titles to fame and to public gratitude, the manner in which he has  steered the vessel of State through the Scylla and Charybdis of the  American War will, I think, always stand conspicuous[3].\"    Minister Adams, in the later years of the Civil War, saw reason somewhat  to modify his earlier judgment, but his indictment of Great Britain was  long prevalent in America, as, indeed, it was also among the historians  and writers of Continental Europe--notably those of France and Russia.  To what extent was this dictum justified? Did Great Britain in spite of  her long years of championship of personal freedom and of leadership in  the cause of anti-slavery seize upon the opportunity offered in the  disruption of the American Union, and forgetting humanitarian idealisms,  react only to selfish motives of commercial advantage and national  power? In brief, how is the American Civil War to be depicted by  historians of Great Britain, recording her attitude and action in both  foreign and domestic policy, and revealing the principles of her  statesmen, or the inspirations of her people?    It was to answer this question that the present work was originally  undertaken; but as investigation proceeded it became progressively more  clear that the great crisis in America was almost equally a crisis in  the domestic history of Great Britain itself and that unless this were  fully appreciated no just estimate was possible of British policy toward  America. Still more it became evident that the American Civil War, as  seen through British spectacles, could not be understood if regarded as  an isolated and unique situation, but that the conditions preceding that  situation--some of them lying far back in the relations of the two  nations--had a vital bearing on British policy and opinion when the  crisis arose. No expanded examination of these preceding conditions is  here possible, but it is to a summary analysis of them that this first  chapter is devoted.           *       *       *       *       *    On the American War for separation from the Mother Country it is  unnecessary to dilate, though it should always be remembered that both  during the war and afterwards there existed a minority in Great Britain  strongly sympathetic with the political ideals proclaimed in  America--regarding those ideals, indeed, as something to be striven for  in Britain itself and the conflict with America as, in a measure, a  conflict in home politics. But independence once acknowledged by the  Treaty of Peace of 1783, the relations between the Mother Country and  the newly-created United States of America rapidly tended to adjust  themselves to lines of contact customary between Great Britain and any  other Sovereign State. Such contacts, fixing national attitude and  policy, ordinarily occur on three main lines: governmental, determined  by officials in authority in either State whose duty it is to secure the  greatest advantage in power and prosperity for the State; commercial,  resulting, primarily, from the interchange of goods and the business  opportunities of either nation in the other's territory, or from their  rivalry in foreign trade; idealistic, the result of comparative  development especially in those ideals of political structure which  determine the nature of the State and the form of its government. The  more obvious of these contacts is the governmental, since the attitude  of a people is judged by the formal action of its Government, and,  indeed, in all three lines of contact the government of a State is  directly concerned and frequently active. But it may be of service to a  clearer appreciation of British attitude and policy before 1860, if the  intermingling of elements required by a strict chronological account of  relations is here replaced by a separate review of each of the three  main lines of contact.    Once independence had been yielded to the American Colonies, the  interest of the British Government rapidly waned in affairs American.  True, there still remained the valued establishments in the West Indies,  and the less considered British possessions on the continent to the  north of the United States. Meanwhile, there were occasional frictions  with America arising from uncertain claims drawn from the former  colonial privileges of the new state, or from boundary contentions not  settled in the treaty of peace. Thus the use of the Newfoundland  fisheries furnished ground for an acrimonious controversy lasting even  into the twentieth century, and occasionally rising to the danger point.  Boundary disputes dragged along through official argument, survey  commissions, arbitration, to final settlement, as in the case of the  northern limits of the State of Maine fixed at last by the Treaty of  Washington of 1842, and then on lines fair to both sides at any time in  the forty years of legal bickering. Very early, in 1817, an agreement  creditable to the wisdom and pacific intentions of both countries, was  reached establishing small and equal naval armaments on the Great Lakes.  The British fear of an American attack on Canada proved groundless as  time went on and was definitely set at rest by the strict curb placed by  the American Government upon the restless activities of such of its  citizens as sympathized with the followers of McKenzie and Papineau in  the Canadian rebellion of 1837[4].    None of these governmental contacts affected greatly the British policy  toward America. But the \"War of 1812,\" as it is termed in the United  States, \"Mr. Madison's War,\" as it was derisively named by Tory  contemporaries in Great Britain, arose from serious policies in which  the respective governments were in definite opposition. Briefly, this  was a clash between belligerent and neutral interests. Britain, fighting  at first for the preservation of Europe against the spread of French  revolutionary influence, later against the Napoleonic plan of Empire,  held the seas in her grasp and exercised with vigour all the accustomed  rights of a naval belligerent. Of necessity, from her point of view,  and as always in the case of the dominant naval belligerent, she  stretched principles of international law to their utmost interpretation  to secure her victory in war. America, soon the only maritime neutral of  importance, and profiting greatly by her neutrality, contested point by  point the issue of exceeded belligerent right as established in  international law. America did more; she advanced new rules and theories  of belligerent and neutral right respectively, and demanded that the  belligerents accede to them. Dispute arose over blockades, contraband,  the British \"rule of 1756\" which would have forbidden American trade  with French colonies in war time, since such trade was prohibited by  France herself in time of peace. But first and foremost as touching the  personal sensibilities and patriotism of both countries was the British  exercise of a right of search and seizure to recover British sailors.    Moreover this asserted right brought into clear view definitely opposed  theories as to citizenship. Great Britain claimed that a man once born a  British subject could never cease to be a subject--could never \"alienate  his duty.\" It was her practice to fill up her navy, in part at least, by  the \"impressment\" of her sailor folk, taking them whenever needed, and  wherever found--in her own coast towns, or from the decks of her own  mercantile marine. But many British sailors sought security from such  impressment by desertion in American ports or were tempted to desert to  American merchant ships by the high pay obtainable in the  rapidly-expanding United States merchant marine. Many became by  naturalization citizens of the United States, and it was the duty of  America to defend them as such in their lives and business. America  ultimately came to hold, in short, that expatriation was accomplished  from Great Britain when American citizenship was conferred. On shore  they were safe, for Britain did not attempt to reclaim her subjects  from the soil of another nation. But she denied that the American flag  on merchant vessels at sea gave like security and she asserted a naval  right to search such vessels in time of peace, professing her complete  acquiescence in a like right to the American navy over British merchant  vessels--a concession refused by America, and of no practical value  since no American citizen sought service in the British merchant marine.    This \"right of search\" controversy involved then, two basic points of  opposition between the two governments. First America contested the  British theory of \"once a citizen always a citizen[5]\"; second, America  denied any right whatever to a foreign naval vessel in _time of peace_  to stop and search a vessel lawfully flying the American flag. The  _right of search in time of war_, that is, a belligerent right of  search, America never denied, but there was both then and later much  public confusion in both countries as to the question at issue since,  once at war, Great Britain frequently exercised a legal belligerent  right of search and followed it up by the seizure of sailors alleged to  be British subjects. Nor were British naval captains especially careful  to make sure that no American-born sailors were included in their  impressment seizures, and as the accounts spread of victim after victim,  the American irritation steadily increased. True, France was also an  offender, but as the weaker naval power her offence was lost sight of in  view of the, literally, thousands of _bona fide_ Americans seized by  Great Britain.
