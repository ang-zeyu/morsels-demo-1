It is true that, in this case, the current would be in the  neighborhood of 15,000 amperes. Laboratory voltameters frequently have  a resistance of a hundred ohms; it would require a million in  derivation to produce the same effect. The specific resistance of the  solutions that can be employed in the production of gases by  electrolysis is, in round numbers, twenty thousand times greater than  that of mercury. In order to obtain a resistance of 0.0001 of an ohm,  it is necessary to sensibly satisfy the equation                20,000 l/s = 1/10,000    _l_ expressing the thickness of the voltameter expressed in meters,  and _s_ being the section in square millimeters. For example: For l =  1/10, s = 20,000,000, say 20 square meters. It will be seen from this  example what should be the proportions of apparatus designed for a  production on a large scale.    The new principles that permit of the construction of such voltameters  are as follows: (1) the substitution of an alkaline for the acid  solution, thus affording a possibility of employing iron electrodes;  (2) the introduction of a porous partition between the electrodes, for  the purpose of separating the gases.    _Electrolytic Liquid._--Commandant Renard's experiments were made with  15 per cent, solution of caustic soda and water containing 27 per  cent. of acid. These are the proportions that give the maximum of  conductivity. Experiments made with a voltameter having platinum  electrodes separated by an interval of 3 or 4 centimeters showed that  for a determinate E.M.F. the alkaline solution allows of the passage  of a slighter intenser current than the acidulated water, that is to  say, it is less resistant and more advantageous from the standpoint of  the consumption of energy.    _Porous Partition._--Let us suppose that the two parts of the trough  are separated by a partition containing small channels at right angles  with its direction. It is these channels alone that must conduct the  electricity. Their conductivity (inverse of resistance) is  proportional to their total section, and inversely proportional to  their common length, whatever be their individual section. It is,  therefore, advantageous to employ partitions that contain as many  openings as possible.    The separating effect of these partitions for the gas is wholly due to  capillary phenomena. We know, in fact, that water tends to expel gas  from a narrow tube with a pressure inversely proportional to the  tube's radius. In order to traverse the tube, the gaseous mass will  have to exert a counter-pressure greater than this capillary pressure.  As long as the pressure of one part and another of the wet wall  differs to a degree less than the capillary pressure of the largest  channel, the gases disengaged in the two parts of the trough will  remain entirely separate. In order that the mixing may not take place  through the partition above the level of the liquid (dry partition),  the latter will have to be impenetrable in every part that emerges.  The study of the partitions should be directed to their separating  effect on the gases, and to their electric resistance. In order to  study the first of these properties, the porous partition, fixed by a  hermetical joint to a glass tube, is immersed in the water (Fig. 2).  An increasing pressure is exerted from the interior until the passage  of bubbles is observed. The pressure read at this moment on the  manometer indicates (transformed above the electrolytic solution) the  changes of level that the bath may undergo. The different porcelains  and earths behave, from this point of view, in a very unequal manner.  For example, an earthen vessel from the Pillivayt establishment  supports some decimeters of water, while the porcelain of Boulanger,  at Choisy-le-Roi, allows of the passage of the gas only at pressures  greater than one atmosphere, which is much more than is necessary.  Wire gauze, canvas, and asbestos cloth resist a few centimeters of  water. It might be feared, however, that the gases, violently  projected against these partitions, would not pass, owing to the  velocity acquired. Upon this point experiment is very reassuring.  After filling with water a canvas bag fixed to the extremity of a  rubber tube, it is possible to produce in the interior a tumultuous  disengagement of gas without any bubbles passing through.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--ARRANGEMENT FOR THE STUDY OF CAPILLARY  REACTION IN POROUS VESSELS.]    From an electrical point of view, partitions are of very unequal  quality. Various partitions having been placed between electrodes  spaced three centimeters apart, currents were obtained which indicated  that, with the best of porcelains, the rendering of the apparatus is  diminished by one-half. Asbestos cloth introduces but an insignificant  resistance.    To this inconvenience of porous vessels is added their fragility,  their high price, and the impossibility of obtaining them of the  dimensions that large apparatus would call for. The selection of  asbestos cloth is therefore clearly indicated; but, as it does not  entirely separate the gases, except at a pressure that does not exceed  a few centimeters of water, it was always necessary to bring back the  variation of the level to these narrow limits by a special  arrangement. We cannot, in fact, expect that the entire piping shall  be always in such conditions that no difference in pressure can occur.  The levels are brought back to equality within the effective limits by  interposing between the voltameter and the piping an apparatus called  a compensator, which consists of two vessels that communicate in the  interior part through a large tube. The gases enter each vessel  through a pipe that debouches beneath the level of the water. If a  momentary stoppage occurs in one of the conduits, the water changes  level in the compensator, but the pressure remains constant at the  orifice of the tubes. The compensator is, as may be seen, nothing more  than a double Mariotte flask. When it is desired to obtain pure gases,  there is introduced into the compensator a solution of tartaric acid,  which retains the traces of alkalies carried along by the current of  gas. The alkaline solution, moreover, destroys the ozone at the moment  of its formation.    It will be seen that laboratory studies have furnished all the  elements of a problem which is now capable of entering the domain of  practice. The cheapness of the raw materials permits of constructing  apparatus whose dimensions will no longer be limited except by reasons  of another nature. The electrodes may be placed in proximity at will,  owing to the use of the porous partition. It may be seen, then, that  the apparatus will have a considerable useful effect without its being  necessary to waste the electric energy beyond measure.    _Industrial Apparatus._--We have shown how the very concise researches  of Commandant Renard have fixed the best conditions for the  construction of an industrial voltameter. It remains for us to  describe this voltameter itself, and to show the rendering of it.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--PLANT FOR THE INDUSTRIAL ELECTROLYSIS OF  WATER.]    The industrial voltameter consists of a large iron cylinder. A battery  of such voltameters is shown to the left of Fig. 3, and one of the  apparatus, isolated, is represented in Fig. 4. The interior electrode  is placed in an asbestos cloth bag, which is closed below and tied at  its upper part. It is provided with apertures which permit of the  ascent of the gases in the interior of the cylinder. The apparatus is  hermetically sealed at the top, the two electrodes being naturally  insulated with rubber. Above the level of the liquid the interior  electrode is continuous and forms a channel for the gas. The hydrogen  and oxygen, escaping through the upper orifices, flow to the  compensator. The apparatus is provided with an emptying cock or a cock  for filling with distilled water, coming from a reservoir situated  above the apparatus.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--DETAILS OF AN INDUSTRIAL VOLTAMETER.]    The constants of the voltameter established by Commandant Renard are  as follows:          Height of external electrode       3.405 m.           \"      internal      \"          3.290 \"        Diameter of external    \"          0.300 \"           \"        internal    \"          0.174 \"    The iron plate employed is 2 millimeters in thickness. The electric  resistance is about 0.0075 ohm. The apparatus gives 365 amperes under  2.7 volts, and consequently nearly 1 kilowatt. Its production in  hydrogen is 158 liters per hour.    It is clear that, in an industrial exploitation, a dynamo working  under 3 volts is never employed. In order to properly utilize the  power of the dynamo, several voltameters will be put in series--a  dozen, for example, if the generating machine is in proximity to the  apparatus, or a larger number if the voltameters are actuated by a  dynamo situated at a distance, say in the vicinity of a waterfall.  Fig. 3 will give an idea of a plant for the electrolysis of water.    It remains for us to say a few words as to the net cost of the  hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by the process that we have just  described. We may estimate the value of a voltameter at a hundred  francs. If the apparatus operates without appreciable wear, the  amortizement should be calculated at a very low figure, say 10 per  cent., which is large. In continuous operation it would produce more  than 1,500 cubic meters of gas a year, say a little less than one  centime per cubic meter. The caustic soda is constantly recuperated  and is never destroyed. The sole product that disappears is the  distilled water. Now one cubic meter of water produces more than 2,000  cubic meters of gas. The expense in water, then, does not amount to a  centime per cubic meter.

John, though forced into a lawyer's office,  would if left to himself have become an artist by profession. The  nearest to Anthony in age was William, afterwards widely celebrated  as a naval engineer. Then came Robert, the most attractive of the  boys. A splendid athlete, compared by Anthony with a Greek statue,  he had sweetness as well as depth of nature. His drawings of horses  were the delight of his family; and when his favourite hunter died  he wrote a graceful elegy on the afflicting event. The influence of  his genial kindness was never forgotten by his youngest brother; but  there was a stronger and more dominating personality of which the  effect was less beneficial to a sensitive and nervous child.    Richard Hurrell Froude is regarded by High Churchmen as an  originator of the Oxford Movement, and he impressed all his  contemporaries by the brilliancy of his gifts. Dean Church went so  far as to compare him with Pascal. But his ideas of bringing up  children were naturally crude, and his treatment of Anthony was more  harsh than wise. His early character as seen at home is described by  his mother in a letter written a year before her death, when he was  seventeen. Fond as she was of him and proud of his brilliant  promise, she did not know what to make of him, so wayward was he and  inconsiderately selfish. \"I am in a wretched state of health,\" the  poor lady explained, \"and quiet is important to my recovery and  quite essential to my comfort, yet he disturbs it for what he calls  'funny tormenting,' without the slightest feeling, twenty times a  day. At one time he kept one of his brothers screaming, from a sort  of teasing play, for near an hour under my window. At another he  acted a wolf to his baby brother, whom he had promised never to  frighten again.\"*    --  * Guiney's Hurrell Froude, p. 8.  --    Anthony was the baby brother, and though this form of teasing was  soon given up, the temper which dictated it remained. Hurrell, it  should be said, inflicted severe discipline upon himself to curb his  own refractory nature. In applying the same to his little brother he  showed that he did not understand the difference between Anthony's  character and his own. But lack of insight and want of sympathy were  among Hurrell's acknowledged defects.    Conceiving that the child wanted spirit, Hurrell once took him up by  the heels, and stirred with his head the mud at the bottom of a  stream. Another time he threw him into deep water out of a boat to  make him manly. But he was not satisfied by inspiring physical  terror. Invoking the aid of the preternatural, he taught his brother  that the hollow behind the house was haunted by a monstrous and  malevolent phantom, to which, in the plenitude of his imagination,  he gave the name of Peningre. Gradually the child discovered that  Peningre was an illusion, and began to suspect that other ideas of  Hurrell's might be illusions too. Superstition is the parent of  scepticism from the cradle to the gave. At the same time his own  faculty of invention was rather stimulated than repressed. He was  encouraged in telling, as children will, imaginative stories of  things which never occurred.    In spite of ghosts and muddy water Anthony worshipped Hurrell, a  born leader of men, who had a fascination for his brothers and  sisters, though not perhaps of the most wholesome kind. The  Archdeacon himself had no crotchets. He was a religious man, to whom  religion meant duty rather than dogma, a light to the feet, and a  lantern for the path. A Tory and a Churchman, he was yet a moderate  Tory and a moderate Churchman; prudent, sensible, a man of the  world. To Hurrell Dissenters were rogues and idiots, a Liberal was  half an infidel, a Radical was, at least in intention, a thief. From  the effect of this nonsense Anthony was saved for a time by his  first school. At the age of nine he was sent to Buckfastleigh, five  miles up the River Dart, where Mr. Lowndes, the rector and patron of  the living, took boarders and taught them, mostly Devonshire boys.  Buckfastleigh was not a bad school for the period. There was plenty  of caning, but no bullying, and Latin was well taught. Froude was a  gentle, amiable child, \"such a very good-tempered little fellow  that, in spite of his sawneyness, he is sure to be liked,\" as his  eldest brother wrote in 1828. He suffered at this time from an  internal weakness, which made games impossible. His passion, which  he never lost, was for Greek, and especially for Homer. With a  precocity which Mill or Macaulay might have envied, he had read both  the Iliad and the Odyssey twice before he was eleven. The standard  of accuracy at Buckfastleigh was not high, and Froude's scholarship  was inexact. What he learnt there was to enjoy Homer, to feel on  friendly terms with the Greeks and Trojans, at ease with the  everlasting wanderer in the best story-book composed by man.  Anthony's holidays were not altogether happy. He was made to work  instead of amusing himself, and forced into an unwholesome  precocity. Then at eleven he was sent to Westminster.    In 1830 the reputation of Westminster stood high. The boarding-  houses were well managed, the lagging in them was light, and their  tone was good. Unhappily, in spite of the head master's  remonstrances, Froude's father, who had spent a great deal of money  on his other sons' education, insisted on placing him in college,  which was then far too rough for a boy of his age and strength. On  account of what he had read, rather than what he had learnt, at  Buckfastleigh, he took a very high place, and was put with boys far  older than himself. The lagging was excessively severe. The bullying  was gross and unchecked. The sanitary accommodation was abominable.  The language of the dormitory was indecent and profane. Froude,  whose health prevented him from the effective use of nature's  weapons, was woke by the hot points of cigars burning holes in his  face, made drunk by being forced to swallow brandy punch, and  repeatedly thrashed. He was also more than half starved, because the  big fellows had the pick of the joints at dinner, and left the small  fellows little besides the bone. Ox-tail soup at the pastrycook's  took the place of a meal which the authorities were bound to  provide. Scandalous as all this may have been, it was not peculiar  to Westminster. The state of college at Winchester, and at Eton, was  in many respects as bad. Public schools had not yet felt the  influence of Arnold and of the reforming spirit. Head masters  considered domestic details beneath them, and parents, if they felt  any responsibility at all, persuaded themselves that boys were all  the better for roughing it as a preparation for the discipline of  the world. The case of Froude, however, was a peculiarly bad one. He  was suffering from hernia, and the treatment might well have killed  him. Although his lagging only lasted for a year, he was  persistently bullied and tormented, until he forgot what he had  learned, instead of adding to it. When the body is starved and ill-  treated, the mind will not work. The head master, Dr. Williamson,  was disappointed in a boy of whom he had expected so much, and wrote  unfavourable reports. After enduring undeserved and disabling  hardships for three years and a half, Froude was taken away from  Westminster at the age of fifteen.    To escape from such a den of horrors was at first a relief. But he  soon found that his miseries were not over. He came home in  disgrace. His misfortunes were regarded as his faults, and the worst  construction was put upon everything he said or did. His clothes and  books had been freely stolen in the big, unregulated dormitory. He  was accused of having pawned them, and his denials were not  believed. If he had had a mother, all might have been well, for no  woman with a heart would assume that her child was lying. The  Archdeacon, without a particle of evidence, assumed it at once, and  beat the wretched boy severely in the presence of the approving  Hurrell. Hurrell would have made an excellent inquisitor. His  brother always spoke of him as peculiarly gifted in mind and in  character; but he knew little of human nature, and he doubtless  fancied that in torturing Anthony's body he was helping Anthony's  soul. To alter two words in the fierce couplet of the satirist,    He said his duty, both to man and God,  Required such conduct, which seemed very odd.    Anthony was threatened, in the true inquisitorial spirit, with a   series of floggings, until he should confess what he had not done.  At last, however, he was set down as incorrigibly stupid, and given  up as a bad job. The Archdeacon arrived at the conclusion that his  youngest son was a fool, and might as well be apprenticed to a  tanner. Having hoped that he would be off his hands as a student of  Christ Church at sixteen, he was bitterly disappointed, and took no  pains to conceal his disappointment.    To Anthony himself it seemed a matter of indifference what became of  him, and a hopeless mystery why he had been brought into the world.  He had no friend. The consumption in the family was the boy's only  hope. His mother had died of it, and his brother Robert, who had  been kind to him, and taught him to ride. It was already showing  itself in Hurrell. His own time could not, he thought, be long.  Meanwhile, he was subjected to petty humiliations, in which the  inventive genius of Hurrell may be traced. He was not, for instance,  permitted to have clothes from a tailor. Old garments were found in  the house, and made up for him in uncouth shapes by a woman in the  village. His father seldom spoke to him, and never said a kind word  to him. By way of keeping him quiet, he was set to copy out Barrow's  sermons. It is difficult to understand how the sternest  disciplinarian,"]]]
