The diaeresis is placed over _u_ in \"guee\" and \"guei\" when the _u_ is to  be sounded.[5]    [Footnote 5: In poetry also to divide an ordinary diphthong into two  syllables for the sake of rhythm.]                                Tilde.    The tilde (~) is used on the letter _N_ to turn it into _N_, as Manana  (morning) (in old Spanish spelt Mannana).                   Notes of Interrogation and Exclamation.    These are used in Spanish both at the beginning and at the end of the  question or exclamation, as ?Que quiere V.? (what do you want?),  iCuantos sufrimientos! (how much suffering!). Note that at the beginning  they are reversed.    The other signs of punctuation are used as in English.    Capital letters are used as in English with the following exceptions--    (1) Adjectives of nationality are written with small letters, as Un  libro ingles (an English book).    (2) Days of the week generally (and sometimes the months of the year)  are written with small letters.                      DIVISION OF WORDS INTO SYLLABLES.    After the first syllable each succeeding one _commences with a  consonant_, as a-for-tu-na-da-men-te (fortunately), except when a  prefix occurs before a primitive word,[6] as Organizar (to organise).    [Footnote 6: A few minor exceptions will be learnt by practice.]    Des-or-ga-ni-zar (to disorganise).    When two consonants occur together one letter belongs to one syllable  and the other to the next, as--    Ac-ci-den-te (accident) Pe-ren-ne (perennial) Tem-po-ral-men-te  (temporarily) In-me-dia-to (immediate)    EXCEPTION--_bl, br, pl, pr, cl, cr, dr, fl, fr, gl, gr_ and _tr_ are not  divided, as--    A-blan-dar (to soften)  Li-bro (book)  A-pla-zar (to postpone)  A-pre-ciar (to appreciate)  De-cla-mar (to declaim)  De-cre-tar (to decree)  A-me-dren-tar (to frighten)  Con-fla-gra-cion (conflagration)  Re-fren-dar (to countersign)  A-glo-me-rar (to agglomerate)  A-gran-dar (to enlarge)  En-con-trar (to meet)    If any of these combinations occur together with a third consonant, this  of course will belong to the previous syllable, as    Em-bro-llar (to entangle).    If four consonants come together, two belong to the first syllable and  two to the next, as Obs-tru-ir (to obstruct).    _Ll_ and _Rr_, being treated as single letters, must not be divided,  as--    Ba-lle-na (whale)  Una ca-lle (a street)  A-lla-nar (to level)  Tie-rra (earth)                                      LESSON I.                              THE ARTICLE.      The =Definite Article= in Spanish is    =El= before a masculine[7] noun singular  =La=  \"       feminine[7]    \"    \"      [Footnote 7: Spanish nouns are all masculine or feminine. There are no  _neuter nouns_.]    as--    El hombre (the man)--La mujer (the woman)  El libro (the book)--La pluma (the pen)      El recibo (the receipt)--La cuenta (the account)    =Los= before a masculine noun plural  =Las=    \"     feminine    \"    \"    as--    Los muchachos (the boys)--Las senoras (the ladies)  Los generos (the goods)--Las facturas (the invoices)  Los lapices (the pencils)--Las cartas (the letters).    The =Indefinite Article= is--      =Un= before a masculine noun singular  =Una=     \"   feminine    \"     \"    as--    Un amigo (a friend)--Una amiga (a lady-friend)  Un padre (a father)--Una madre (a mother)      The Indefinite Article has no plural, but the Spanish plural forms  \"unos\" (masc.) and \"unas\" (fem.) translate the English words \"some\" or  \"any,\" as Unos hermanos (some brothers), Unas hermanas (some sisters),  Unos tinteros (some inkstands), Unas mesas (some tables). (The Spanish  words \"Algunos,\" \"Algunas,\" are also used for the same purpose.)    NOTE 1.--Before a feminine noun _singular_ commencing with _a_ or _ha_  use =El= and =Un= instead of _La_ and _Una_ if such nouns are _stressed  on the first syllable_, as El aguila (the eagle), El agua (the water),  El alma (the soul). (The plural is regular, as Las aguilas (the  eagles).)    NOTE 2.--The Definite Article has a \"neuter form\" which is =Lo=. _It  cannot be used before a noun_ but before other parts of speech used to  represent an abstract idea, as Yo amo lo bello (I love the beautiful,  viz., all that which is beautiful), Lo sublime (the sublime, viz., all  that which is sublime).

They have seen the necessity of laws at home, after  depleting their salmon rivers, deer runs and seal floes to the danger  point. And there is no reason to suppose that an excellent population  in so many ways would be any harder to deal with in this one than the  hordes of poachers and sham sportsmen much nearer home.    Of course, everything ultimately turns on the enforcement of the laws.  And I still think that two naturalists and twenty men afloat and the  same number ashore, with double these numbers when Hudson bay and the  Arctic are included, would be enough to patrol Labrador  satisfactorily, if they were in touch with local and leasehold wardens  and with foresters, if the telegraph was used only on their side, if  they and the general inspector were all of the right kind, and if the  whole service was vigorously backed up at headquarters. Two fast motor  cruisers and suitable means of making the land force also as mobile as  possible are _sine qua non_.    The Ungava peninsula, Hudson bay and Arctic together would mean a  million square miles for barely a hundred men. But, with close  co-operation between sea and land, they could guard the sanctuaries as  efficiently as private wardens guard leased limits, watch the outlets  of the trade, and harry law-breakers in the intervening spaces. Of  course, the system will never be complete till the law is enforced  against both buyers and sellers in the market. But it is worth  enforcing, worth it in every way. And the interest of the wild life  growing on a million miles will soon pay the keep of the hundred men  who guard its capital.      LEASEHOLDS    An article by Mr. W.H. Blake, K.C., of Toronto, on \"The Laurentides  National Park\" appeared in the February number of the _University  Magazine_. The following extracts have been taken from Mr. Blake's  manuscript:    \"It was in the year 1895, that the idea took substance of setting  apart some two thousand five hundred square miles of the wild and  mountainous country north of Quebec and south of Lake St. John as 'a  forest reservation, fish and game preserve, public park and pleasure  ground'. At a later date, the area was increased, until now some three  thousand seven hundred square miles are removed from sale or  settlement. An important though indirect object was the maintenance of  water-level in the dozen or more rivers which take their rise in the  high-lying plateau forming the heart of the Park.    \"When the ice takes in early November the caribou make it their great  rallying ground. These animals, so wary in summer and early autumn,  appear to gain confidence by their numbers, and are easily stalked and  all too easily shot. It is to be feared that too great an annual toll  is taken, and that the herd is being diminished by more than the  amount of its natural increase. Slightly more stringent regulations,  the allowance of one caribou instead of two, the forbidding of  shooting in December and January, when the bulls have lost their  horns, would effect the result, and would ensure excellent sport in  the region so long as the Park exists and is administered as it is  to-day. There is, however, very serious menace to the caribou in the  unfortunate fact that the great timber wolf has at last discovered  this happy hunting ground. Already it would seem that there are fewer  caribou, but the marked increase in the number of moose may be one  cause of this. Before the days of the Park the moose were almost  exterminated throughout this region; but a few must have escaped  slaughter in some inaccessible fastness, and under a careful and  intelligent system of protection they have multiplied exceedingly. Man  may not shoot them, and probably only unprotected calves have anything  to dread from the wolves.    \"In the administration of this Reserve the government adopts a policy  which has shown admirable results; and as this policy is in direct  contrast to the one pursued in the Algonquin Park it may be  interesting to explain and discuss it. It can be admitted, as a matter  of theory, that a 'public park and pleasure ground' should be  maintained by the people for the people, and that no individuals  should have exclusive rights conferred upon them to fish or shoot  within it. This ideal conception takes no account of human nature, and  a scheme that has to do with the control and conduct of men should not  disregard their weaknesses, or the powerful motive of self-interest.  The greater part of the Laurentide Park is free to anyone who takes  out a license and complies with certain regulations. But, at the  points most threatened by poachers, the practice is followed of  granting five-year leases of moderate areas to individuals and to  clubs. The first requirement of these grants is that the lessee shall  appoint a guardian, approved by the Department, and shall cause the  conceded territories to be protected in an adequate manner. The  guardian, for his part, is immediately answerable to an individual who  pays his salary. He contrasts his former precarious living as a  trapper or poacher with the assured competence which he now earns more  easily, and makes his election in favor of virtue. Thus he becomes a  faithful servant both of the Government and his employer, and a  really effective unit in the protection of the Park. The lessee, in  turn, will neither practice nor tolerate any infringement of the laws  which would imperil his lease, nor deplete of fish and game a country  which he intends to revisit. He would not necessarily be actuated by  these motives if he entered the Park casually and considered nothing  but his own sport or pleasure. It may be added that the lessee has  reasonable assurance of the extension of his privileges if they are  not abused and knows that he will be compensated for moneys properly  expended if the Government sees fit not to renew his term. The  guardians co-operate with one another under the general guidance of a  most competent inspector, and the striking increase in fish, fur and  feather is apparent not only in the region immediately protected but  also ouside its boundaries. Trappers who fought bitterly against being  excluded from this part of the public domain now find that the  overflow of wild life into the surrounding country enables them to  bring more pelts to market than they did in the old days, and have  become reconciled. Guardians, gillies, carters, porters and canoemen  live in whole or in part, on providing fishing and shooting. Under no  other arrangement could the conceded territory afford sport and a  living to so many people, and in no other way could the balance  between resources and their exhaustion be so nicely maintained.\"    On page 47, Mr. Blake corroborates the statement of the shameful act I  mentioned at the bottom of page 18 of my _Address_. \"On sighting a  band of six caribou he bade his man sit down to give him a rest for  his rifle. He then fired and continued firing till all were killed.  When his companion made to walk towards the animals, Sir ---- said to  him roughly:    \"'Where are you going?'    \"'To cut up the caribou.'    \"'... I don't want them.'\"    This game murderer killed three times as many as the prescribed limit  on this one occasion. Yet nothing was done to him!      SANCTUARIES    However desirable they are from any point of view leaseholds are not  likely to cover much of Labrador for some time to come. They should be  encouraged only on condition that every lessee of every  kind--sportsman, professional on land or water, lumberman or  other--accepts the obligation to keep and enforce the wild-life  protection laws in co-operation with the public wardens who guard the  sanctuaries, watch the open areas and patrol the trade outlets.    I have very little to add to what I said about sanctuaries in the  _Address_. Most of the information received since it was published has  only emphasized the points it made. And as no one has opposed and many  have supported the establishment of the Harrington sanctuary I again  recommend it strongly. The 64 miles in a straight line between cape  Whittle and cape Mekattina should be made into an absolute sanctuary  for all birds and mammals. If some more ground can be taken in on  either side, so much the better. But the 64 miles must be kept in any  case. The Bird rocks and Bonaventure island, one of the Mingans, the  Perroquets, Egg island and The Pilgrims, are all desirable in every  way. There are plenty of islands to choose from along the Atlantic  Labrador and round Hudson and James bays. It is most important to keep  the migratory birds free from molestation during the first fortnight  after their arrival; and the same applies to migratory mammals, though  not quite in the same way. Inland sanctuaries should be made near  Hamilton inlet, in the Mingan and Mistassini districts and up the  Eastmain river. Ultimately an Arctic sanctuary might be made on  either Baffin or Melville islands. A meteorological station in the  Arctic, linked up with Labrador by wireless, would be of great benefit  to the weather forecasts, as we now have no reports from where so much  of our cold or mild winters are affected by the different drift of  enormous ice-fields; and whenever one is established, a wild-life  protection station should accompany it.    Sanctuaries should never be too big; not one tenth of the whole area  will ever be required for them. But they should be placed where they  will best serve the double purpose of being natural wild \"zoos\" and  over-flowing reservoirs of wild-life. The exact situations of most,  especially inland, will require a good deal of co-operative study  between zoologists and other experts. But there is no doubt whatever,  that they ought to be established, no matter how well the laws are  enforced over both leaseholds and"]]]
