At last the door leading to the yard was opened and the dogs raced and  tumbled out, looking like great, tawny lions and cubs rushing from stone  cages. They ate a breakfast of boiled rice that was poured into troughs  for them, then Jan turned impatiently to the door, hoping it would not  be very long before Brother Antoine would come for him. When the monk  appeared on the stone steps Jan trembled nervously, and went forward  quickly, but stopped at a certain point. He remembered what his mother  had told him and Rollo. They must never step beyond that place, even  though visitors called to them. Brother Antoine smiled as he saw the pup  halt.    \"Time for your first lesson, Prince Jan,\" said the monk in his gentle  voice that all the dogs loved. Rollo whined pleadingly, and the monk  laughed, \"Yes, you, too, Rollo. Come along, both of you!\"    With sharp yelps they followed to the door, through the arched  corridors, up a short flight of steps, past a big room. Rollo and Jan  waited impatiently while Brother Antoine unfastened three doors, one  after the other, and then as the last one opened, the two dogs dashed  out into the snow.    They gave little barks of joy and thrust their noses into the cold white  mass, tossing it high and digging into drifts with broad clumsy paws,  then stopping to rush at each other and tumble almost out of sight in  their play.    It was summer-time at the Hospice, though no one would have guessed it,  for the snow lay in masses on all sides, the little lake was frozen  over, and the peaks of the mountains were sheeted with snow and  blue-white ice that never melted the year around. There was not so much  danger for travellers during the months of July and August, and as the  work was lighter for both the dogs and the monks, the puppies were then  taken out for their first lessons.    A collar was fastened to Prince Jan's neck and from it hung a small  bell that tinkled clearly with each step the proud little fellow took.  When he looked back he saw his brother also had a collar and bell, and  then a casket was tied to each pup's neck. Both dogs watched the monks  and at a sign from Brother Antoine they trotted carefully along the  narrow, slippery way.    There were no trees, grass, or flowers growing for many miles around the  Hospice, for the earth was buried deep under rocks, and these rocks were  covered all the time with a white blanket of snow, which drifted into  the hollow places until it was many feet deep. The narrow trail twisted  between cragged mountains, and often the dogs could look down so far  that it would have made them dizzy, had they not been Hospice dogs.    They trudged along happily for a long distance, then Brother Antoine  spoke to his companion and commanded Jan and Rollo to lie down. They  obeyed at once, and watched him go on alone until he disappeared around  a bend of the trail. The pups looked at each other anxiously, and fixed  their eyes on the face of the monk who had stayed with them, but he was  staring at the trail. Prince Jan whimpered softly, and Rollo echoed the  sound, but neither of them rose to their feet.    \"Wait!\" said the monk, and the dogs trembled with eagerness as they  sniffed the cold air.    At last the monk ordered, \"Go!\" Instantly they leaped to their feet and  raced along the narrow pathway, their noses close against the snow to  catch the scent of Brother Antoine who was somewhere ahead of them.    At times they ran from the path to follow little gullies of heavy snow.  They knew that Brother Antoine had trodden here, though no trace of his  steps could be seen on the surface, for the snow slid quickly in the  summer months, and masses of it kept covering the slopes as it shifted  rapidly. In this way Jan and Rollo trailed Brother Antoine until they  reached a spot where they could find no further scent though they went  around in circles. The other monk, who had followed more slowly, stood  watching them as they paused, uncertain what to do. He made no sign to  help them, but suddenly Prince Jan gave a sharp bark and thrust his nose  deeply into the snow, where he began digging as fast as he could. Rollo,  too, understood, and his front paws worked as fast as his brother's  until they had uncovered the face and shoulders of Brother Antoine, who  had buried himself under the snow to see if they could find him.    Both puppies leaped about in glee, barking and yelping until the sides  of the narrow pass sent back echoes like many unseen dogs answering  them. Brother Antoine rose to his feet, smiling. He patted the soft,  fuzzy heads while the other monk told how the dogs had acted without any  help at all.    \"Jan led the way,\" he said to Brother Antoine. \"He shows wonderful  intelligence.\"    \"It is his father's blood,\" replied Brother Antoine, then he pointed  toward the Hospice. \"Go back!\" he ordered. Prince Jan started obediently  toward his home, while Rollo followed closely, but every once in a while  both dogs turned back, or waited a bit, until the monks caught up to  them.    They reached the stone steps leading up to the front door of the  Hospice. The door swung open, and the puppies, with Brother Antoine,  trudged through the long corridor, down to the basement, under the high  archways and once again were in the big, enclosed yard. The other dogs  crowded about them as they stood proud and important, for that day  Prince Jan and Rollo had learned the first lesson on the trail. But they  both knew that this was only play and their real work would come when  the snow piled so deep about the walls of the Hospice that it almost  reached the high, peaked roof.          Chapter II    THE LAND OF SNOW      The lesson of the trail had to be repeated several times, before the two  puppies understood just what they were expected to do. Day after day  their mother told them more about the brave deeds of the St. Bernard  dogs, for the work of the mother-dogs of the Hospice was to teach the  puppies to be kindly, obedient and loyal to the trust placed in them by  the good monks.    July and August, the two months that were called the summer-time at the  Hospice, passed swiftly, and Jan and Rollo knew that very soon it would  be winter. The first big snow storm blew over the mountains early in  September, while Jan and his brother slept, warm and snug, beside their  mother. Next morning no sun could be seen, and when the dogs rushed into  the enclosures, dark clouds, shrieking winds, and sheets of driving snow  told them that winter had begun and soon there would be hard work for  them all.    Jan and Rollo quivered with excitement and envy when they saw the older  dogs pass through the long corridors that day, and each time one of the  monks came into the basement where the dogs waited, all of them started  to their feet and wagged their tails, hoping to be taken out for work.    While Jan and Rollo watched and waited, their mother talked to them.    \"Sometimes,\" she said, \"you will find a white mound, and you must never  pass it by without digging to see if any one is under it. You have  learned already that when you find a man, you must lick his face and  hands to waken him, and if you cannot rouse him, so that he will stand  up, or put his arms about your neck, you must hurry to the Hospice to  bring the monks. That way, you may save a life, and then, perhaps, you  will have a collar or a medal, like Barry, and travellers who sit in the  big room will be told that you were worthy of your ancestors.\"    \"Tell us about the Big Room,\" begged Rollo, while Jan gave a gentle  little nudge of his nose to coax his mother. Both of them had heard  many times from their mother, from Bruno, and the other older dogs,  about the Big Room, yet they never tired hearing of it. Now they bunched  themselves into furry balls with their heads against their mother's soft  breast, as she began: \"In the Big Room are many beautiful pictures that  have been sent from travellers rescued by our kinsfolk. Sometimes a  handsome collar is sent to a dog that has saved a life, but the greatest  honor of all was the medal that was given to Barry, and the beautiful  marble monument that you puppies have seen near the Hospice. Your father  had a collar sent to him by the men he saved. They knew he would never  wear it, but they asked that it be hung above the fireplace in the Big  Room. Some day, I hope you, Jan and Rollo, will have collars there. Now,  run and play,\" she ended, giving each pup a push with her nose. \"Even  though you cannot go out to-day, you must romp, for that will make your  backs and legs strong. If you are not strong you will be sent away from  the Hospice and never come back. That is a terrible thing for a St.  Bernard. I don't want it to happen to either of you!\"    Though it was so cold and stormy, the two dogs leaped to their feet and  ran through the half-shut door that led to the big enclosure. Jan was  ahead, and Rollo scampered after him. Around and around the yard they  went, dodging each other until Rollo managed to catch the tip of his  brother's fuzzy tail. This did not make Jan stop running, so Rollo was  dragged after him through the heaps of snow, rolling over and over but  clinging tightly until Jan turned and pounced upon him. They tumbled  about, sometimes Jan was on top, sometimes Rollo, and they looked like a  huge, yellow spider with eight sturdy, furry legs kicking wildly. At  last, panting, they sprawled facing each other with pink tongues hanging  from their open mouths and eyes twinkling merrily.    The sound of Brother Antoine's voice made them look up quickly, and they  saw two visitors were with him. The dogs were accustomed to visitors,  for in the summer many people came to see the Hospice and the dogs, but  in the winter the strangers sought refuge from storms.    \"Come on, Rollo,\" called Jan, as the monk and the men with him came down  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#2)"],[1,"the  contention that the Native skull is thicker than that of the  European.[5] That the thick, woolly hair of the Native may account for  his supposed comparative invulnerability to head injuries has not  occurred to the layman observer who is more often given to vehement  assertion than to careful enquiry.    The supposed arrest of the brain of the Bantu at the age of puberty  owing to the closing of the sutures of the skull at an earlier age than  happens with Europeans is another popular notion for which a sort of  pseudo-scientific authority may be quoted from encyclopaedias and old  books of travel. The opinion of modern authorities on this subject is  that those who say that the closure of the sutures of the skull  determines brain growth would or should also say that the cart pulls the  horse, for, if the sutures of the Native skull close at a somewhat  earlier date in the average Native than in the average European then it  simply means that the Native reaches maturity slightly earlier than the  average white man.    The loss of mental alertness which is said by some to be peculiar to the  Natives at the time of puberty is very often met with in the European  youth or girl at that period of life. Competent observers have of late  years come to the conclusion that this supposed falling off in  intelligence, in so far as it may differ in degree from what has so  often been noticed in European boys and girls at that point of  development, is due to psychological and not to physiological causes. It  is realised that this lapse in mental power of concentration in European  youth in the stage of early adolescence is prevented by the force of  example and fear of parental and general reprobation coupled with  unbroken school-discipline, all of which factors are as yet seldom  present in the surroundings of the average Bantu boy or girl.    The outward ethnic differentiae of the Bantu are admittedly palpable and  patent to everyone, but in the opinion of competent observers there is  nothing in the anatomy of the black man to make him a lower beast than  the man with the white skin. It is now seen that there is no apparent  relation between complexion or skull shape and intelligence, but while  this is so there appears to be a correlation between the size of the  brain and the number of cells and fibres of which it is made up,  although this correlation is so weak as to be difficult of  demonstration.[6]    The capacity of the normal human cranium varies from 1,000 cubic  centimetres to 1,800 cubic centimetres, the mean capacity of female  crania being 10 per cent. less than the mean of male crania. On this  basis skulls are classified in the text books as being _microcephalic_  when below 1,350 cubic centimetres, such as those of the extinct  Tasmanians, Bushmen, Andamanese, Melanesians, Veddahs, and the Hill-men  of India; _mesocephalic_, those from 1,350 to 1,450 cubic centimetres,  comprising Negroes, Malays, American Indians, and Polynesians; and  _megacephalic_, above 1,450 cubic centimetres, including Eskimos,  Europeans, Mongolians, Burmese and Japanese. The mean capacity among  Europeans is fixed at 1,500 cubic centimetres, and the average weight of  the brain at 1,300 grams.    These figures show that the skull capacity of the average European is  larger than that of the average Negro, and as it seems plausible that  the greater the central nervous system, the higher will be the faculty  of the race, and the greater its aptitude for mental achievements, the  conclusion that the European is superior in this respect seems on the  face of it to be well grounded. There are, however, certain relevant  facts which qualify this inference, and these must be briefly  considered.    The anthropologist Manouvrier measured thirty-five skulls of eminent  white men and found them to be of an average capacity of 1,665 cubic  centimetres as compared to 1,560 cubic centimetres general average  derived from 110 ordinary individuals. On the other hand he found that  the cranial capacity of forty-five murderers was 1,580 cubic  centimetres, also superior to the general average. Professor Franz Boas,  in discussing this experiment, says that most of the brain weights  constituting the general series are obtained in anatomical institutes,  and the individuals who find their way there are poorly developed on  account of malnutrition and of life under unfavourable circumstances,  while the eminent men represent a much better nourished class. As poor  nourishment reduces the weight and size of the whole body, it will also  reduce the size and weight of the brain.[7] Dr. Arthur Keith when  dealing with the so-called Piltdown skull in his book \"The Antiquity of  Man\" says to the same effect that the size of brain is a very imperfect  index of mental ability in that we know that certain elements enter into  the formation of the brain which take no direct part in our mental  activity, so that a person who has been blessed with a great robust body  and strong, massive limbs requires a greater outfit of mere tracts and  nerve cells for the purposes of mere animal administration than the  smaller person with trunk and limbs of a moderate size.[8]    It seems fair, therefore, to assume that the brain-weights of big men of  the Zulu, the Xosa and the Fingo tribes will be considerably above those  of European women, but to conclude from this that the capacity of the  big black man is higher than that of the average white woman would  hardly be possible to-day. I would say here that I do not accept the  suggestion, recently advanced, that the mental faculty of woman is  qualitatively different from that of man. I hold that there is no  difference of any kind between the intellectual powers of the male and  female human being. The comparative lack of mental achievement on the  part of women in the past I believe to have been due to a natural, and,  as I think, wholesome feminine disinclination to take up intellectual  studies and scientific pursuits that until recently have been deemed the  prerogative of men, and not to any innate inferiority of the female  brain.    According to Professor Sollas, whose high authority cannot be disputed,  the size of the brain when looked at broadly seems to be connected with  the taxinomic rank of the race, but when we come to details the  connection between cranial capacity and mental endowment becomes less  obvious. The Eskimo, for instance, who is of short stature, has a  cranial capacity of 1,550 cubic centimetres, thus surpassing some of the  most civilised peoples of Europe, and yet no one of this race has so far  startled the world with any kind of mental achievement. \"The result,\"  says Professor Sollas, \"of numerous investigations carried out during  the last quarter of a century is to show that, within certain limits, no  discoverable relation exists between the magnitude of the brain--or even  its gross anatomy--and intellectual power,\" and he illustrates this  statement by a list giving the cranial capacities and brain-weights of a  number of famous men which shows that though Bismarck had a skull  capacity of 1,965 cubic centimetres, Liebniz, who attained to the  highest flights of genius, had a cranium measuring only 1,422 cubic  centimetres.    Dealing more particularly with the assumed relation between highly  specialised mental faculties and the anatomy of the brain, as apart from  its mere size, the same author cites the case of Dr. Georg Sauerwein,  who was master of forty or fifty languages, and whose brain after his  death at the age of 74 in December, 1904, was dissected by Dr. L. Stieda  with the idea that, since it is known that the motor centre for speech  is situated in what is called Broca's area, some connection between  great linguistic powers and the size or complication of the frontal lobe  might be found in this highly specialised brain, but the examination  revealed nothing that could be correlated with Sauerwein's exceptional  gift.[9]    Professor R.R. Marett in his handbook on Anthropology says, in  discussing the subject of race, \"You will see it stated that the size of  the brain cavity will serve to mark off one race from another. This is  extremely doubtful, to put it mildly. No doubt the average European  shows some advantage in this respect as compared, say, with the Bushmen.  But then you have to write off so much for their respective types of  body, a bigger body going in general with a bigger head, that in the end  you find yourself comparing mere abstractions. Again, the European may  be the first to cry off on the ground that comparisons are odious; for  some specimens of Neanderthal man, in sheer size of brain cavity, are  said to give points to any of our modern poets and politicians.... Nor,  if the brain itself be examined after death, and the form and number of  its convolutions compared, is this criterion of hereditary brain-power  any more satisfactory. It might be possible in this way to detect the  difference between an idiot and a person of normal intelligence, but not  the difference between a fool and a genius.\"[10]    In his book, \"The Human Body,\" Dr. Keith, in dealing with racial  characters, begs his readers to break away from the common habit of  speaking and thinking of various races as high and low. \"High and low,\"  he says, \"refers to civilisation; it does not refer to the human  body.\"[11]    The foregoing authoritative opinions serve to show that the Bantu, as  compared with other races, labour under no apparent physiological  disabilities to hinder them in the process of mental development. Let us  now consider in the light of modern psychology upon first-hand and  reliable evidence the allegation of mental inferiority that is  constantly brought against these people.
