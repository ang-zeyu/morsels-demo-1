Song 3.  _Praise to God for our Redemption_.    1 Blest be the wisdom and the power,  The justice and the grace,  That join'd in council to restore  And save our ruin'd race!    2 Our father eat forbidden fruit,  And from his glory fell;  And we, his children, thus were brought  To death, and near to hell.    3 Blest be the Lord, that sent his Son  To take our flesh and blood;  He for our lives gave up his own,  To make our peace with God.    4 He honour'd all his Father's laws,  Which we have disobey'd;  He bore our sins upon the cross,  And our full ransom paid.    5 Behold him rising from the grave;  Behold him rais'd on high:  He pleads his merits there to save  Transgressors doom'd to die.    6 There on a glorious throne, he reigns,  And by his power divine  Redeems us from the slavish chains  Of Satan, and of sin.    7 Thence shall the Lord to judgment come,  And, with a sovereign voice,  Shall call, and break up every tomb,  While waking saints rejoice.    8 O may I then with joy appear  Before the Judge's face,  And, with the blest assembly there,  Sing his redeeming grace!      Song 4.  _Praise for Mercies Spiritual and Temporal_.    1 Whene'er I take my walks abroad,  How many poor I see?  What shall I render to my God  For all his gifts to me?    2 Not more than others I deserve,  Yet God hath given me more;  For I have food, while others starve,  Or beg from door to door.    3 How many children in the street  Half naked I behold?  While I am clothed from head to feet,  And cover'd from the cold.    4 While some poor wretches scarce can tell  Where they may lay their head,  I have a home wherein to dwell,  And rest upon my bed.    5 While others early learn to swear,  And curse, and lie, and steal,  Lord, I am taught thy name to fear,  And do thy holy will.    6 Are these thy favours, day by day  To me above the rest?  Then let me love thee more than they,  And try to serve thee best.      Song 5.  _Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land_.    1 Great God, to thee my voice I raise,  To thee my youngest hours belong;  I would begin my life with praise,  Till growing years improve the song.    2 'Tis to thy soveraign grace I owe,  That I was born on Brittish ground,  Where streams of heavenly mercy flow,  And words of sweet salvation sound.    3 I would not change my native land  For rich Peru, with all her gold:  A nobler prize lies in my hand  Than East or Western Indies hold.    4 How do I pity those that dwell  Where ignorance and darkness reigns;  They know no heav'n, they fear no hell,  Those endless joys, those endless pains.    5 Thy glorious promises, O Lord,  Kindle my hope and my desire;  While all the preachers of thy word  Warn me t' escape eternal fire.    6 Thy praise shall still employ my breath,  Since thou hast mark'd my way to heaven;  Nor will I run the road to death,  And wast the blessings thou hast given.      Song 6.  _Praise for the Gospel_.    1 Lord, I ascribe it to thy grace,  And not to chance as others do,  That I was born of Christian race,  And not a Heathen, or a Jew.    2 What would the ancient Jewish kings,  And Jewish prophets once have given,  Could they have heard these glorious things,  Which Christ reveal'd, and brought from heav'n!    3 How glad the Heathens would have been,  That worship idols, wood, and stone,  If they the book of God had seen,  Or Jesus and his gospel known!    4 Then if the Gospel I refuse,  How shall I e'er lift up mine eyes?  For all the Gentiles and the Jews  Against me will in judgment rise.      Song 7.  _The Excellency of the Bible_.    1 Great God, with wonder and with praise,  On all thy works I look;  But still thy wisdom, power and grace  Shine brighter in thy Book.    2 The stars that in their courses roll,  Have much instruction given;  But thy good Word informs my soul  How I may climb to heaven.    3 The fields provide me food, and show  The goodness of the Lord;  But fruits of life and glory grow  In thy most holy Word.    4 Here are my choicest treasures hid,  Here my best comfort lies;  Here my desires are satisfy'd;  And hence my hopes arise.    5 Lord, make me understand thy law,  Show what my faults have been;  And from thy Gospel let me draw  Pardon for all my sin.    6 Here would I learn how Christ has dy'd  To save my soul from hell:  Not all the books on earth beside  Such heav'nly wonders tell.    7 Then let me love my Bible more,  And take a fresh delight  By day to read these wonders o'er,  And meditate by night.      Song 8.  _Praise to God for learning to read_.    1 The praises of my tongue  I offer to the Lord,  That I was taught, and learnt so young  To read his holy Word.    2 That I am taught to know  The danger I was in,  By nature and by practice too  A wretched slave to sin.    3 That I am led to see  I can do nothing well;  And whither shall a sinner flee,  To save himself from hell?    4 Dear Lord, this book of thine  Informs me where to go  For grace to pardon all my sin,  And make me holy too.    5 Here I can read and learn  How Christ the Son of God  Did undertake our great concern,  Our ransom cost his blood.    6 And now he reigns above,  He sends his Spirit down,  To show the wonders of his love,  And make his Gospel known.    7 O may that Spirit teach,  And make my heart receive  Those truths which all thy servants preach,  And all thy saints believe!    8 Then shall I praise the Lord  In a more chearful strain,  That I was taught to read his Word,  And have not learnt in vain.      Song 9.  The All-Seeing God.    1 Almighty God, thy piercing eye  Strikes through the shades of night,  And our most secret actions lie  All open to thy sight.    2 There's not a sin that we commit,  Nor wicked word we say,  But in thy dreadful book `tis writ  Against the judgment-day.    3 And must the crimes that I have done  Be read and publish'd there,  Be all exposed before the sun,  While men and angels hear?    4 Lord, at thy feet ashamed I lie,  Upward I dare not look;  Pardon my sins before I die,  And blot them from thy book.    5 Remember all the dying pains  That my Redeemer felt,  And let his blood wash out my stains,  And answer for my guilt.    6 O may I now for ever fear  T' indulge a sinful thought,  Since the great God can see, and hear,  And writes down every fault!      Song 10.  _Solemn Thoughts of God and Death_.    1 There is a God that reigns above,  Lord of the heavens, and earth, and seas:  I fear his wrath, I ask his love,  And with my lips I sing his praise.    2 There is a law which he has writ,  To teach us all what we must do;  My soul, to his commands submit,  For they are holy, just and true.    3 There is a Gospel of rich grace,  Whence sinners all their comfort draw;  Lord, I repent, and seek thy face;  For I have often broke thy law.    4 There is an hour when I must die,  Nor do I know how soon `twill come;  A thousand children young as I  Are call'd by death to hear their doom.    5 Let me improve the hours I have  Before the day of grace is fled;  There's no repentance in the grave,  No pardons offer'd to the dead.    6 Just as a tree cut down, that fell  To north, or southward, there it lies:  So man departs to heaven or hell,  Fix'd in the state wherein he dies.      Song 11.  _Heaven and Hell_.    1 There is beyond the sky  A heaven of joy and love,  And holy children, when they die,  Go to that world above.    2 There is a dreadful hell,  And everlasting pains,  There sinners must with devils dwell  In darkness, fire, and chains.    3 Can such a wretch as I  Escape this cursed end?  And may I hope, whene'er I die,  I shall to heaven ascend?    4 Then will I read and pray  While I have life and breath;  Lest I should be cut off to day,  And sent t' eternal death.      Song 12.  _The Advantages of early Religion_.    1 Happy's the child whose youngest years  Receive instruction well;  Who hates the sinner's path, and fears  The road that leads to hell.    2 When we devote our youth to God,  'Tis pleasing in his eyes;  A flower, when offer'd in the bud,  Is no vain sacrifice.    3 'Tis easier work if we begin  To fear the Lord betimes;  While sinners that grow old in sin  Are hard'ned in their crimes.    4 'Twill save us from a thousand snares  To mind religion young;  Grace will preserve our following years  And make our vertue strong.    5 To thee, Almighty God, to thee  Our childhood we resign;  'Twill please us to look back and see  That our whole lives were thine.    6 Let the sweet work of prayer and praise,  Employ my youngest breath;  Thus I'm prepar'd for longer days,  Or fit for early death.      Song 13.  _The Danger of Delay_.    1 Why should I say, \"`Tis yet too soon  \"To seek for heaven or think of death?\"  A flower may fade before `tis noon,  And I this day may lose my breath.    2 If this rebellious heart of mine,  Despise the gracious calls of Heaven;  I may be hard'ned in my sin,  And never have repentance given.    3 What if the Lord grow wroth, and swear  While I refuse to read and pray,  That he'll refuse to lend an ear,  To all my groans another day?    4 What if his dreadful anger burn,  While I refuse his offer'd grace,  And all his love to fury turn,  And strike me dead upon the place?    5 'Tis"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#2)"],[1,"es.    6. AN EXAMPLE.--The men and women who study and practice medicine are  not the worse, but the better for such knowledge; so it would be to  the community in general if all would be properly instructed on the  laws of health which relate to the sexes.    7. CRIME AND DEGRADATION.--Had every person a sound understanding on  the relation of the sexes, one of the most fertile sources of crime  and degradation would be removed. Physicians know too well what sad  consequences are constantly occurring from a lack of proper knowledge  on these important subjects.    8. A CONSISTENT CONSIDERATION.--Let the reader of this work study its  pages carefully and be able to give safe counsel and advice to others,  and remember that purity of purpose and purity of character are the  brightest jewels in the crown of immortality.    [Illustration: BEGINNING RIGHT.]             *       *       *       *       *    THE BEGINNING OF LIFE.      1. THE BEGINNING.--There is a charm in opening manhood which has  commended itself to the imagination in every age. The undefined hopes  and promises of the future--the dawning strength of intellect--the  vigorous flow of passion--the very exchange of home ties and protected  joys for free and manly pleasures, give to this period an interest and  excitement unfelt, perhaps, at any other.    2. THE GROWTH OF INDEPENDENCE.--Hitherto life has been to boys, as to  girls, a dependent existence--a sucker from the parent growth--a home  discipline of authority and guidance and communicated impulse. But  henceforth it is a transplanted growth of its own--a new and free  power of activity in which the mainspring is no longer authority or  law from without, but principle or opinion within. The shoot which  has been nourished under the shelter of the parent stem, and bent  according to its inclination, is transferred to the open world, where  of its own impulse and character it must take root, and grow into  strength, or sink into weakness and vice.    3. HOME TIES.--The thought of home must excite a pang even in the  first moments of freedom. Its glad shelter--its kindly guidance--its  very restraints, how dear and tender must they seem in parting! How  brightly must they shine in the retrospect as the youth turns from  them to the hardened and unfamiliar face of the world! With what a  sweet sadly-cheering pathos they must linger in the memory! And then  what chance and hazard is there in his newly-gotten freedom! What  instincts of warning in its very novelty and dim inexperience! What  possibilities of failure as well as of success in the unknown future  as it stretches before him!    4. VICE OR VIRTUE.--Certainly there is a grave importance as well as  a pleasant charm in the beginning of life. There is awe as well as  excitement in it when rightly viewed. The possibilities that lie in  it of noble or ignoble work--of happy self-sacrifice or ruinous  self-indulgence--the capacities in the right use of which it may rise  to heights of beautiful virtue, in the abuse of which it may sink to  the depths of debasing vice--make the crisis one of fear as well as of  hope, of sadness as well as of joy.    5. SUCCESS OR FAILURE.--It is wistful as well as pleasing to think of  the young passing year by year into the world, and engaging with its  duties, its interests, and temptations. Of the throng that struggle  at the gates of entrance, how many may reach their anticipated goal?  Carry the mind forward a few years, and some have climbed the hills  of difficulty and gained the eminence on which they wished to  stand--some, although they may not have done this, have kept their  truth unhurt, their integrity unspoiled; but others have turned back,  or have perished by the way, or fallen in weakness of will, no more to  rise again; victims or their own sin.    6. WARNING.--As we place ourselves with the young at the opening gates  of life, and think of the end from the beginning, it is a deep concern  more than anything else that fills us. Words of earnest argument and  warning counsel rather than of congratulation rise to our lips.    7. MISTAKES ARE OFTEN FATAL.--Begin well and the habit of doing well  will become quite as easy as the habit of doing badly. \"Well begun  is half ended,\" says the proverb: \"and a good beginning is half  the battle.\" Many promising young men have irretrievably injured  themselves by a first false step at the commencement of life; while  others of much less promising talents, have succeeded simply by  beginning well, and going onward. The good, practical beginning is  to a certain extent, a pledge, a promise, and an assurance of the  ultimate prosperous issue. There is many a poor creature, now crawling  through life, miserable himself and the cause of sorrow to others,  who might have lifted up his head and prospered, if, instead of merely  satisfying himself with resolutions of well-doing, he had actually  gone to work and made a good, practical beginning.    8. BEGIN AT THE RIGHT PLACE.--Too many are, however, impatient of  results. They are not satisfied to begin where their fathers did,  but where they left off. They think to enjoy the fruits of industry  without working for them. They cannot wait for the results of labor  and application, but forestall them by too early indulgence.             *       *       *       *       *    HEALTH A DUTY.      Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will  both be adequately cared for, as a diffusion of the belief that the  preservation of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is  such a thing as physical morality.    Men's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat  their bodies as they please. Disorder entailed by disobedience to  nature's dictates they regard as grievances, not as the effects of  a conduct more or less flagitious. Though the evil consequences  inflicted on their descendents and on future generations are often as  great as those caused by crime, they do not think themselves in any  degree criminal.    It is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily  transgression is recognized; but none appear to infer that if this  bodily transgression is vicious, so too is every bodily transgression.  The fact is, all breaches of the law of health are physical sins.    When this is generally seen, then, and perhaps not till then, will the  physical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves.    Purity of life and thought should be taught in the home. It is the  only safeguard of the young. Let parents wake up on this important  subject.    [Illustration: GLADSTONE.]             *       *       *       *       *    VALUE OF REPUTATION.      1. WHO SHALL ESTIMATE THE COST.--Who shall estimate the cost of a  priceless reputation--that impress which gives this human dross its  currency--without which we stand despised, debased, depreciated? Who  shall repair it injured? Who can redeem it lost? Oh, well and truly  does the great philosopher of poetry esteem the world's wealth as  \"trash\" in the comparison. Without it gold has no value; birth, no  distinction; station, no dignity; beauty, no charm; age, no reverence;  without it every treasure impoverishes, every grace deforms,  every dignity degrades, and all the arts, the decorations and  accomplishments of life stand, like the beacon-blaze upon a rock,  warning the world that its approach is dangerous; that its contact is  death.    2. THE WRETCH WITHOUT IT.--The wretch without it is under eternal  quarantine; no friend to greet; no home to harbor him, the voyage of  his life becomes a joyless peril, and in the midst of all ambition  can achieve, or avarice amass, or rapacity plunder, he tosses on the  surge, a buoyant pestilence. But let me not degrade into selfishness  of individual safety or individual exposure this individual principle;  it testifies a higher, a more ennobling origin.    3. ITS DIVINITY.--Oh, Divine, oh, delightful legacy of a spotless  reputation: Rich is the inheritance it leaves; pious the example  it testifies; pure, precious and imperishable, the hope which it  inspires; can there be conceived a more atrocious injury than to filch  from its possessor this inestimable benefit to rob society of its  charm, and solitude of its solace; not only to out-law life, but  attain death, converting the very grave, the refuge of the sufferer,  into the gate of infamy and of shame.    4. LOST CHARACTER.--We can conceive few crimes beyond it. He who  plunders my property takes from me that which can be repaired by time;  but what period can repair a ruined reputation? He who maims my person  effects that which medicine may remedy; but what herb has sovereignty  over the wounds of slander? He who ridicules my poverty or reproaches  my profession, upbraids me with that which industry may retrieve, and  integrity may purify; but what riches shall redeem the bankrupt fame?  What power shall blanch the sullied show of character? There can be  no injury more deadly. There can be no crime more cruel. It is without  remedy. It is without antidote. It is without evasion.

If you always live with those who are lame, you will learn to  limp.--FROM THE LATIN.    If men wish to be held in esteem, they must associate with those who  are estimable.--LA BRUYERE.      1. BY WHAT MEN ARE KNOWN.--An author is known by his writings, a  mother by her daughter, a fool by his words, and all men by their  companions.    2. FORMATION OF A GOOD CHARACTER.--Intercourse with persons of decided  virtue and excellence is of great importance in the formation of a  good character. The force of example is powerful; we are creatures of  imitation, and, by a necessary influence, our tempers and habits  are very much formed on the model of those with whom we familiarly  associate.
