As an essential progress in the tar paper roofing may be  mentioned the invention of the double tar paper roof, and the wood  cement roof, which is regarded as an offshoot.    The tar paper industry has, within the last forty years, assumed great  dimensions, and the preferences for this roofing are gaining ground  daily. In view of the small weight of the covering material, the wood  construction of the roof can be much lighter, and the building is  therefore less strained by the weight of the roof than one with the  other kind, so that the outer walls need not be as heavy. Considering  the price, the paper roof is not only cheaper than other fireproof  roofs, but its light weight makes it possible for the whole building  to be constructed lighter and cheaper. The durability of the tar paper  roof is satisfactory, if carefully made of good material; the double  tar paper roof, the gravel double roof, and the wood cement roof are  distinguished by their great durability.    These roofs may be used for all kinds of buildings, and not only are  factories, storehouses, and country buildings covered with it, but  also many dwellings. The most stylish residences and villas are at  present being inclosed with the more durable kinds; the double roof,  the gravel double roof, and the wood cement roof. For factory  buildings, which are constantly shaken by the vibrations of the  machinery, the tar paper roof is preferable to any other.    In order to ascertain to what degree tar paper roofs would resist  fire, experiments were instituted at the instigation of some of the  larger manufacturers of roofing paper, in the presence of experts,  architects, and others, embracing the most severe tests, and it was  fully proved that the tar paper roof is as fireproof as any other.  These experiments were made in two different ways; first, the  readiness of ignition of the tar paper roof by a spark or flame from  the outside was considered, and, second, it was tested in how far it  would resist a fire in the interior of the building. In the former  case, it was ascertained that a bright, intense fire could be kept  burning upon the roof for some time, without igniting the woodwork of  the roof, but heat from above caused some of the more volatile  constituents of the tar to be expelled, whereby small flames appeared  upon the surface within the limits of the fire; the roofing paper was  not completely destroyed. There always remained a cohesive substance,  although it was charred and friable, which by reason of its bad  conductivity of heat protected the roof boarding to such an extent  that it was \"browned\" only by the developed tar vapors. A fire was  next started within a building covered with a tar paper roof; the  flame touched the roof boarding, which partly commenced to char and  smoulder, but the bright burning of the wood was prevented by the  air-tight condition of the roof; the fire gases could not escape from  the building. The smoke collecting under the roof prevented the  entrance of fresh air, in consequence of which the want of oxygen  smothered the fire. The roofing paper remained unchanged. By making  openings in the sides of the building so that the fire gases could  escape, the wood part of the roof was consumed, but the roofing paper  itself was only charred and did not burn. After removing the fire in  contact with the paper, this ceased burning at once and evinced no  disposition whatever to spread. In large conflagrations, also, the tar  paper roofs behaved in identically a similar manner. Many instances  have occurred where the tar paper roof prevented the fire from  spreading inside the building, and developing with sufficient  intensity to work injury.    As it is of interest to the roofer to know the manner of making the  material he uses, we give in the following a short description of the  manufacture of roofing paper. At first, when square sheets were used  exclusively, the raw paper consisted of ordinary dipped or formed  sheets. The materials used in its manufacture were common woolen rags  and other material. In order to prepare the pulp from the rags it is  necessary to cut them so small that the fabric is entirely dissolved  and converted into short fibers. The rags are for this purpose first  cut into pieces, which are again reduced by special machines. The rags  are cut in a rag cutting machine, which was formerly constructed  similar to a feed cutter; later on, more complicated machines of  various constructions were employed. It is not our task to describe  the various kinds, but we remain content with the general remark that  they are all based on the principles of causing revolving knives to  operate upon the rags. The careful cleansing of the cut rags,  necessary for the manufacture of paper, is not required for roofing  paper. It is sufficient to rinse away the sand and other solid  extraneous matter. The further reduction of the cut rags was formerly  performed in a stamp mill, which is no longer employed, the pulp mill  or rag engine being universally used.    The construction of this engine may be described as follows: A box or  trough of wood, iron, or stone is by a partition divided into two  parts which are connected at their ends. At one side upon the bottom  of the box lies an oakwood block, called the back fall. In a hollow of  this back fall is sunk the so-called plate, furnished with a number of  sharp steel cutters or knives, lying alongside of each other. A roller  of solid oakwood, the circumference of which is also furnished with  sharp steel cutters or knives, is fastened upon a shaft and revolves  within the hollow. The journal bearings of the shaft are let into and  fastened in movable wooden carriers. The carriers of the bearings may  be raised and lowered by turning suitable thumbscrews, whereby the  distance between the roller and the back fall is increased or  decreased. The whole is above covered with a dome, the so-called case,  to prevent the throwing out of the mass under the operation of  grinding. The roller is revolved with a velocity of from 100 to 150  revolutions per minute, whereby the rags are sucked in between the  roller and the back fall and cut and torn between the knives. At the  beginning of the operation, the distance between the roller and the  back fall is made as great as possible, the intention being less to  cut the rags than to wash them thoroughly. The dirty water is then  drawn off and replaced by clean, and the space of the grinding  apparatus is lessened gradually, so as to cut the rags between the  knives. The mass is constantly kept in motion and each piece of rag  passes repeatedly between the knives. The case protects the mass from  being thrown out by the centrifugal force. The work of beating the  rags is ended in a few hours, and the ensuing thin paste is drawn off  into the pulp chest, this being a square box lined with lead.    From the pulp chest it passes to the form of the paper machine. This  form consists of an endless fine web of brass wire, which revolves  around rollers. The upper part of this form rests upon a number of  hollow copper rollers, whereby a level place is formed. The form  revolves uniformly around the two end rollers, and has at the same  time a vibratory motion, by which the pulp running upon the form is  spread out uniformly and conducted along, more flowing on as the  latter progresses. The water escapes rapidly through the close wire  web. In order to limit the form on the sides two endless leather  straps revolve around the rollers on each side, which touch with their  lower parts the form on both sides and confine the fluid within a  proper breadth. The thickness of the pulp is regulated at the head of  the form by a brass rule standing at a certain height; its function is  to level the pulp and distribute it at a certain thickness. The  continually moving pulp layer assumes greater consistency the nearer  it approaches to the dandy roll. This is a cylinder covered with brass  wire, and is for the purpose of compressing the paper, after it has  left the form, and free it from a great part of the water, which  escapes into a box. The paper is now freed of a good deal of the  fluid, and assumes a consistency with which it is enabled to leave the  form, which now commences to return underneath the paper, passing on  to an endless felt, which revolves around rollers and delivers it to  two iron rolls. The paper passes through a second pair of iron  rollers, the interiors of which are heated by steam. These rollers  cause the last of the water to be evaporated, so that it can then be  rolled upon reels. A special arrangement shaves the edges to the exact  size required.    The paper is made in different thicknesses and designated by numbers  to the size and weight.    Waste paper, bookbinders' shavings, etc., can be used for making the  paper. As much wool as possible should be employed, because the wool  fiber has a greater resistance than vegetable fiber to the effects of  the temperature. By wool fiber is understood the horny substance  resembling hair, with the difference that the former has no marrowy  tissue. The covering pellicle of the wool fiber consists of flat,  mostly elongated leaves, with more or less corners, lying over each  other like scales, which makes the surface of the fiber rough; this  condition, together with the inclination of curling, renders it  capable of felting readily. Pure wool consists of a horny substance,  containing both nitrogen and sulphur, and dissolves in a potash  solution. In a clean condition, the wool contains from 0.3 to 0.5 per  cent. of ash. It is very hygroscopical, and under ordinary  circumstances it contains from 13 to 16 per cent. humidity, in dry air  from 7 to 11 per cent., which can be entirely expelled at a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#2)"],[1,"worked at skilled labor were by this prejudice  forced to do drudgery or find employment in other cities. The president  of a \"mechanical association\" was publicly tried in 1830 by that  organization for the crime of assisting a colored youth to learn a  trade.[20] A young man of high character, who had at the cabinet-making  trade in Kentucky saved enough to purchase his freedom, came to  Cincinnati about this time, seeking employment. He finally found a  position in a shop conducted by an Englishman. On entering the  establishment, however, the workmen threw down their tools, declaring  that the Negro had to leave or that they would. The unfortunate  \"intruder\" was accordingly dismissed. He then entered the employ of a  slaveholder, who at the close of the Negro's two years of service at  common labor discovered that the black was a mechanic. The employer then  procured work for him as a rough carpenter. By dint of perseverance and  industry this Negro within a few years became a master workman,  employing at times six or eight men, but he never received a single job  of work from a native-born citizen from a free State.[21]    The hardships of the Negroes of this city, however, had just begun. The  growth of a prejudiced public opinion led not only to legal proscription  and social ostracism but also to open persecution. With the cries of the  Southerners for the return of fugitives and the request of white  immigrants for the exclusion of Negroes from that section, came the  demand to solve the problem by enforcing the \"Black Laws.\" Among certain  indulgent officials these enactments had been allowed to fall into  desuetude. These very demands, however, brought forward friends as well  as enemies of the colored people. Their first clash was testing the  constitutionality of the law of 1807. When the question came up before  the Supreme Court, this measure was upheld.[22] Encouraged by such  support, the foes of the Negroes forced an execution of the law. The  courts at first hesitated but finally took the position that the will of  the people should be obeyed. The Negroes asked for ninety days to comply  with the law and were given sixty. When the allotted time had expired,  however, many of them had not given bonds as required. The only thing to  do then was to force them to leave the city. The officials again  hesitated but a mob quickly formed to relieve them of the work. This was  the riot of 1829. Bands of ruffians held sway in the city for three  days, as the police were unable or unwilling to restore order. Negroes  were insulted on the streets, attacked in their homes, and even killed.  About a thousand or twelve hundred of them found it advisable to leave  for Canada West where they established the settlement known as  Wilberforce.[23]    This upheaval, though unusually alarming, was not altogether a bad omen.  It was due not only to the demands which the South was making upon the  North and the fear of the loss of Southern trade, but also to the rise  of the Abolition Societies, the growth of which such a riotous condition  as this had materially fostered. In a word, it was the sequel of the  struggle between the proslavery and the anti-slavery elements of the  city. This was the time when the friends of the Negroes were doing most  for them. Instead of frightening them away a group of respectable white  men in that community were beginning to think that they should be  trained to live there as useful citizens. Several schools and churches  for them were established. The Negroes themselves provided for their own  first school about 1820; but one Mr. Wing had sufficient courage to  admit persons of color to his evening classes after their first efforts  had failed. By 1834 many of the colored people were receiving systematic  instruction.[24] To some enemies of these dependents it seemed that the  tide was about to turn in favor of the despised cause. Negroes began to  raise sums adequate to their elementary education and the students of  Lane Seminary supplemented these efforts by establishing a colored  mission school which offered more advanced courses and lectures on  scientific subjects twice a week. These students, however, soon found  themselves far in advance of public opinion.[25] They were censured by  the faculty and to find a more congenial center for their operations  they had to go to Oberlin in the Western Reserve where a larger number  of persons had become interested in the cause of the despised and  rejected of men.    During the years from 1833 to 1836 the situation in Cincinnati grew  worse because of the still larger influx of Negroes driven from the  South by intolerable conditions incident to the reaction against the  race. To solve this problem various schemes were brought forth. Augustus  Wattles tells us that he appeared in Cincinnati about this time and  induced numbers of the Negroes to go to Mercer County, Ohio, where they  took up 30,000 acres of land.[26] Others went to Indiana and purchased  large tracts on the public domain.[27] Such a method, however, seemed  rather slow to the militant proslavery leaders who had learned not only  to treat the Negroes as an evil but to denounce in the same manner the  increasing number of abolitionists by whom it was said the Negroes were  encouraged to immigrate into the State.    The spirit of the proslavery sympathizers was well exhibited in the  upheaval which soon followed. This was the riot of July 30, 1836. It was  an effort to destroy the abolition organ, _The Philanthropist_, edited  by James G. Birney, a Southerner who had brought his slaves from  Huntsville, Alabama, to Kentucky and freed them. The mob formed in the  morning, went to the office of _The Philanthropist_, destroyed what  printed matter they could find, threw the type into the street, and  broke up the press. They then proceeded to the home of the printer, Mr.  Pugh, but finding no questionable matter there, they left it  undisturbed. The homes of James G. Birney, Mr. Donaldson and Dr. Colby  were also threatened. The next homes to be attacked were those of Church  Alley, the Negro quarter, but when two guns were fired upon the  assailants they withdrew. It was reported that one man was shot but this  has never been proved. The mob hesitated some time before attacking  these houses again, several of the rioters declaring that they did not  care to endanger their lives. A second onset was made, but it was  discovered that the Negroes had deserted the quarter. On finding the  houses empty the assailants destroyed their contents.[28]    Yet undaunted by this persistent opposition the Negroes of Cincinnati  achieved so much during the years between 1835 and 1840 that they  deserved to be ranked among the most progressive people of the  world.[29] Their friends endeavored to enable them through schools,  churches and industries to embrace every opportunity to rise. These  2,255 Negroes accumulated, largely during this period, $209,000 worth of  property, exclusive of personal effects and three churches valued at  $19,000. Some of this wealth consisted of land purchased in Ohio and  Indiana. Furthermore, in 1839 certain colored men of the city organized  \"The Iron Chest Company,\" a real estate firm, which built three brick  buildings and rented them to white men. One man, who a few years prior  to 1840 had thought it useless to accumulate wealth from which he might  be driven away, had changed his mind and purchased $6,000 worth of real  estate. Another Negro, who had paid $5,000 for himself and family, had  bought a home worth $800 or $1,000. A freedman, who was a slave until he  was twenty-four years old, then had two lots worth $10,000, paid a tax  of $40 and had 320 acres of land in Mercer County. Another, who was  worth only $3,000 in 1836, had seven houses in Cincinnati, 400 acres of  land in Indiana, and another tract in the same county. He was worth  $12,000 or $15,000. A woman who was a slave until she was thirty was  then worth $2,000. She had also come into potential possession of two  houses on which a white lawyer had given her a mortgage to secure the  payment of $2,000 borrowed from this thrifty woman. Another Negro, who  was on the auction block in 1832, had spent $2,600 purchasing himself  and family and had bought two brick houses worth $6,000 and 560 acres of  land in Mercer County, said to be worth $2,500.[30]    This unusual progress had been promoted by two forces, the development  of the steamboat as a factor in transportation and the rise of the Negro  mechanic. Negroes employed on vessels as servants to the travelling  public amassed large sums received in the form of \"tips.\" Furthermore,  the fortunate few, constituting the stewards of these vessels, could by  placing contracts for supplies and using business methods realize  handsome incomes. Many Negroes thus enriched purchased real estate and  went into business in Cincinnati.[31] The other force, the rise of the  Negro mechanic, was made possible by overcoming much of the prejudice  which had at first been encountered. A great change in this respect had  taken place in Cincinnati by 1840. Many who had been forced to work as  menial laborers then had the opportunity to show their usefulness to  their families and to the community. Colored mechanics were then getting  as much skilled labor as they could do. It was not uncommon for white  artisans to solicit employment of colored men because they had the  reputation of being better paymasters than master workmen of the more  favored race.[32] White mechanics not only worked with colored men but  often associated with them, patronized the same barber shop, and went to  the same places of amusement.[33]    In this prosperous condition the Negroes could help themselves. Prior to  this period they had been unable to make any sacrifices for charity and  education. Only $150 of the $1,000 raised for Negro education in 1835  was"]]]
