I.         \"_Let a European war break out--the war, perhaps, between the       Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, which so many journalists       and politicians in England and Germany contemplate with criminal       levity. If the combatants prove to be equally balanced, it may,       after the first battles, smoulder on for thirty years. What will be       the population of London, or Manchester, or Chemnitz, or Bremen, or       Milan, at the end of it_?\" (\"The Great Society,\" by Graham Wallas.       June, 1914.)         (_Copyright, 1914, By The New York Times Company._)      The time has now come to pluck up courage and begin to talk and write  soberly about the war. At first the mere horror of it stunned the more  thoughtful of us; and even now only those who are not in actual contact  with or bereaved relation to its heartbreaking wreckage can think sanely  about it, or endure to hear others discuss it coolly. As to the  thoughtless, well, not for a moment dare I suggest that for the first  few weeks they were all scared out of their wits; for I know too well  that the British civilian does not allow his perfect courage to be  questioned; only experienced soldiers and foreigners are allowed the  infirmity of fear. But they certainly were--shall I say a little upset?

Not for the H. & P. A., anyway,\" said Mr. Bartholomew,  shortly.    \"What does it lack?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"Speed. It's got the power for heavy hauls. It could handle the freight  through the Pas Alos Range. But it would slow up our traffic so that  the shippers would at once turn to the Hendrickton & Western. You  understand that their rails do not begin to engage the grades that our  engineers thought necessary when the old H. & P. A. was built.\"    \"I get that,\" said Tom briskly. \"You have come here, then, to interest  us in the development of a faster but quite as powerful type of  electric locomotive as the Jandel.\"    \"Stated to the line!\" exclaimed Mr. Bartholomew, smiting the arm of his  chair with his clenched fist. \"That is it, young man.  You get me  exactly. And now I will go on to put my proposition to you.\"    \"Do so, Mr. Bartholomew,\" murmured the old inventor, quite as much  interested as his son.    \"I want you to make a study of electric motive power as applied to  track locomotives, with the idea of utilizing our power plants and  others like them, and even with the possibility in mind of the  continued use of the Jandel locomotives on our more level stretches of  road.    \"But I want your investigation to result in the building of locomotives  that will make a speed of two miles a minute, or as near that as  possible, on level rails, and be powerful enough to snake our heavy  freight trains through the hills and over the steep grades so rapidly  that even two engines, a pusher and a hauler, cannot beat the electric  power.\"    \"Some job, that, I'll say,\" murmured Tom Swift.    \"Exactly. Some job. And it is the only thing that will save the H. & P.  A.,\" said Mr. Bartholomew decidedly. \"I put it up to you Swifts. I have  heard of some of your marvelous inventions. Here is something that is  already invented. But it needs development.\"    \"I see,\" said Mr. Swift, and nodded.    \"It interests me,\" admitted Tom. \"As I say, I have given some thought  to the electric locomotive.\"    \"This is the age of speed,\" said Mr. Bartholomew earnestly.  \"Rapidity  in handling freight and kindred things will be the salvation, and the  only salvation, of many railroads. Tapping a rich territory is not  enough. The road that can offer the quickest and cheapest service is  the road that is going to keep out of a receivership. Believe me, I  know!\"    \"You should,\" said Mr. Swift mildly. \"Your experience should have  taught you a great deal about the railroad business.\"    \"It has. But that knowledge is worth just nothing at all without swift  power and cheap traffic. Those are the problems today. Now, I am going  to take a chance. If it doesn't work, my road is dished in any case. So  I feel that the desperate chance is the only chance.\"    \"What is that?\" asked Tom Swift, sitting forward in his chair.  \"I, for  one, feel so much interested that I will do anything in reason to find  the answer to your traffic problem.\"    \"That's the boy!\" ejaculated Richard Bartholomew. \"I will give it to  you in a few words. If you will experiment with the electric locomotive  idea, to develop speed and power over and above the Jandel patent, and  will give me the first call on the use of any patents you may contrive,  I will put up twenty-five thousand dollars in cash which shall be yours  whether I can make use of a thing you invent or not.\"    \"Any time limit in this agreement, Mr. Bartholomew?\" asked Tom, making  a few notes on a scratch pad before him on the library table.    \"What do you say to three months?\"    \"Make it six, if you can,\" Tom said with continued briskness.  \"It  interests me. I'll do my best. And I want you to get your money's  worth.\"    \"All right. Make it six,\" said Mr. Bartholomew. \"But the quicker you  dig something up, the better for me. Now, that is the first part of my  proposition.\"    \"All right, sir. And the second?\"    \"If you succeed in showing me that you can build and operate an  electric locomotive that will speed two miles a minute on a level track  and will get a heavy drag over the mountain grades, as I said, as  surely as two engines of the coal-burning or oil-burning type, I will  pay you a hundred thousand dollars bonus, besides buying all the  engines you can build of this new type for the first two years. I've  got to have first call; but the hundred thousand will be yours free and  clear, and the price of the locomotives you build can be adjusted by  any court of agreement that you may suggest.\"    Tom Swift's face glowed. He realized that this offer was not only  generous, but that it made it worth his while dropping everything else  he had in hand and devoting his entire time and thought for even six  months to the proposition of developing the electric locomotive.    He looked at his father and nodded. Mr. Swift said, calmly:    \"We take you on that offer, Mr. Bartholomew. Tom has the facts on  paper, and we will hand it to Mr. Newton, our financial manager, in the  morning. If you will remain in town for twenty-four hours, the contract  can be signed.\"    \"Suits me,\" declared. Richard Bartholomew, rising quickly from his  chair. \"I confess I hoped you would take me up quite as promptly as you  have. I want to get back West again.    \"We will see you in the office of the company at two o'clock tomorrow,\"  said Tom Swift confidently.    \"Better than good! And now, if that trailer that I am pretty sure  Montagne Lewis sent after me does not get wise to the subject of our  talk, it may be a slick job we have done and will do. I admit I am  rather afraid of the enemy. You Swifts must keep your plans in utter  darkness.\"    After a little talk on more ordinary affairs, Mr. Bartholomew took his  departure. It was getting late in the evening, and Tom Swift had an  engagement. While old Rad, their colored servant, was helping him on  with his coat preparatory to Tom's leaving the house, his father called  from the library:    \"Got those notes in a safe place, Tom?\"    \"Safest in the world, Dad,\" his son replied. But he did not go into  details. Tom considered the \"safest place in the world\" just then was  his own wallet, which was tucked into an inside pocket of his vest \"I'm  going to see Mary Nestor, Father,\" said Tom, as he went to the front  door and opened it.    He halted a moment with the knob of the door in his hand. The porch was  deep in shadows, but he thought he had seen something move there.    \"That you, Koku?\" asked Tom in an ordinary voice. Sometimes his  gigantic servant wandered about the house at night. He was a strange  person, and he had a good many thoughts in his savage brain that even  his young master did not understand.    There was no reply to Tom's question, so he walked down the steps and  out at the gate. It was not a long distance to the Nestor house, and  the air was brisk and keen, in spite of the fact that threatening  clouds masked the stars.    Two blocks from the house he came to a high wall which separated the  street from the grounds of an old dwelling. Tom suddenly noticed that  the usual street lights on this block had been extinguished--blown out  by the wind, perhaps.    Involuntarily he quickened his steps. He reached the archway in the  wall. Here was the gate dividing the private grounds from the street.  As he strode into the shadow of this place a voice suddenly halted Tom  Swift.    \"Hands up! Put 'em up and don't be slow about it!\" A bulky figure  loomed in the dark. Tom saw the highwayman's club poised threateningly  over his head.          Chapter II    Trouble Starts      The fact that he was stopped by a footpad smote Tom Swift's mind as not  a particularly surprising adventure. He had heard that several of that  gentry had been plying their trade about the outskirts of the town. To  a degree he was prepared for this sudden event.    Then there flashed into Tom's mind the thought of what Mr. Richard  Bartholomew had said regarding the spy he believed had followed him  from the West. Could it be possible that some hired thug sent by  Montagne Lewis and his crooked crowd of financiers considered that Tom  Swift had obtained information from the president of the H. & P. A.  that might do his employers signal service?    Tom Swift had fallen in with many adventures--and some quite thrilling  ones--since, as a youth, he was first introduced to the reader in the  initial volume of this series, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Motor  Cycle.\" His first experiences as an inventor, coached by his father,  who had spent his life in the experimental laboratory and workshop, was  made possible by his purchase from Mr. Wakefield Damon, now one of his  closest friends, of a broken-down motor cycle.    Through a series of inventions, some of them of a marvelous kind, Tom  Swift, aided by his father, had forged ahead, building motor boats,  airships, submarines, monoplanes, motion picture cameras, searchlights,  cannons, photo-telephones, war tanks. Of late, as related in \"Tom Swift  Among the Fire Fighters,\" he had engaged in the invention of an  explosive bomb carrying flame-quenching chemicals that would, in time,  revolutionize fire-fighting in tall buildings.    The matter that Mr. Richard Bartholomew, the railroad magnate, had  brought to Tom's and his father's attention had deeply interested the  young inventor. Thought of the electric locomotive, the development of  which the railroad president stated was the only salvation of the  finances of the H. & P. A., had so held Tom's attention as he walked  along the street that being stopped in this sudden way was even more  startling than such an incident might ordinarily have been.    Tom was a muscular young fellow; but a club held over one's head by a  burly thug would have shaken the courage of anybody.  Dark as it was  under the archway the young fellow saw that the bulk of the man was  much greater"]]]
