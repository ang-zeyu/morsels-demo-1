A tall, dark man, accompanied by a woman muffled in grey furs and  wearing a silk scarf over her hair, had passed on foot along the  opposite side of the street. Gray had seen them through the cab windows.    His smooth brow wrinkled and his mouth tightened to a thin straight line  beneath the fair \"regulation\" moustache. He fumbled under his overcoat  for loose silver, drew out a handful and paid off the taximan.    Sometimes walking in the gutter in order to avoid the throngs upon  the pavement, regardless of the fact that his glossy dress-boots were  becoming spattered with mud, Gray hurried off in pursuit of the pair.  Twenty yards ahead he overtook them, as they were on the point of  passing a picture dealer's window, from which yellow light streamed  forth into the humid dusk. They were walking slowly, and Gray stopped in  front of them.    \"Hello, you two!\" he cried. \"Where are you off to? I was on my way to  call for you, Rita.\"    Flushed and boyish he stood before them, and his annoyance was  increased by their failure to conceal the fact that his appearance was  embarrassing if not unwelcome. Mrs. Monte Irvin was a petite, pretty  woman, although some of the more wonderful bronzed tints of her hair  suggested the employment of henna, and her naturally lovely complexion  was delicately and artistically enhanced by art. Nevertheless, the  flower-like face peeping out from the folds of a gauzy scarf, like a  rose from a mist, whilst her soft little chin nestled into the fur,  might have explained even in the case of an older man the infatuation  which Quentin Gray was at no pains to hide.    She glanced up at her companion, Sir Lucien Pyne, a swarthy, cynical  type of aristocrat, imperturbably. Then: \"I had left a note for  you, Quentin,\" she said hurriedly. She seemed to be in a dangerously  high-strung condition.    \"But I have booked a table and a box,\" cried Gray, with a hint of  juvenile petulance.    \"My dear Gray,\" said Sir Lucien coolly, \"we are men of the world--and  we do not look for consistency in womenfolk. Mrs. Irvin has decided to  consult a palmist or a hypnotist or some such occult authority before  dining with you this evening. Doubtless she seeks to learn if the play  to which you propose to take her is an amusing one.\"    His smile of sardonic amusement Gray found to be almost insupportable,  and although Sir Lucien refrained from looking at Mrs. Irvin whilst  he spoke, it was evident enough that his words held some covert  significance, for:    \"You know perfectly well that I have a particular reason for seeing  him,\" she said.    \"A woman's particular reason is a man's feeble excuse,\" murmured Sir  Lucien rudely. \"At least, according to a learned Arabian philosopher.\"    \"I was going to meet you at Prince's,\" said Mrs. Irvin hurriedly, and  again glancing at Gray. There was a pathetic hesitancy in her manner,  the hesitancy of a weak woman who adheres to a purpose only by supreme  effort.    \"Might I ask,\" said Gray, \"the name of the pervert you are going to  consult?\"    Again she hesitated and glanced rapidly at Sir Lucien, but he was  staring coolly in another direction.    \"Kazmah,\" she replied in a low voice.    \"Kazmah!\" cried Gray. \"The man who sells perfume and pretends to read  dreams? What an extraordinary notion. Wouldn't tomorrow do? He will  surely have shut up shop!\"    \"I have been at pains to ascertain,\" replied Sir Lucien, \"at Mrs.  Irvin's express desire, that the man of mystery is still in session and  will receive her.\"    Beneath the mask of nonchalance which he wore it might have been  possible to detect excitement repressed with difficulty; and had Gray  been more composed and not obsessed with the idea that Sir Lucien had  deliberately intruded upon his plans for the evening, he could not have  failed to perceive that Mrs. Monte Irvin was feverishly preoccupied with  matters having no relation to dinner and the theatre. But his private  suspicions grew only the more acute.    \"Then if the dinner is not off,\" he said, \"may I come along and wait for  you?\"    \"At Kazmah's?\" asked Mrs. Irvin. \"Certainly.\" She turned to Sir Lucien.  \"Shall you wait? It isn't much use as I'm dining with Quentin.\"    \"If I do not intrude,\" replied the baronet, \"I will accompany you as far  as the cave of the oracle, and then bid you good night.\"    The trio proceeded along old Bond Street. Quentin Gray regarded the  story of Kazmah as a very poor lie devised on the spur of the moment.  If he had been less infatuated, his natural sense of dignity must  have dictated an offer to release Mrs. Irvin from her engagement. But  jealousy stimulates the worst instincts and destroys the best. He  was determined to attach himself as closely as the old Man of the  Sea attached himself to Es-Sindibad, in order that the lie might  be unmasked. Mrs. Irvin's palpable embarrassment and nervousness he  ascribed to her perception of his design.    A group of shop girls and others waiting for buses rendered it  impossible for the three to keep abreast, and Gray, falling to the rear,  stepped upon the foot of a little man who was walking close behind them.    \"Sorry, sir,\" said the man, suppressing an exclamation of pain--for the  fault had been Gray's.    Gray muttered an ungenerous acknowledgment, all anxiety to regain the  side of Mrs. Irvin; for she seemed to be speaking rapidly and excitedly  to Sir Lucien.    He recovered his place as the two turned in at a lighted doorway. Upon  the wall was a bronze plate bearing the inscription:        KAZMAH      Second Floor    Gray fully expected Mrs. Irvin to suggest that he should return later.  But without a word she began to ascend the stairs. Gray followed, Sir  Lucien standing aside to give him precedence. On the second floor was a  door painted in Oriental fashion. It possessed neither bell nor knocker,  but as one stepped upon the threshold this door opened noiselessly as  if dumbly inviting the visitor to enter the square apartment discovered.  This apartment was richly furnished in the Arab manner, and lighted by  a fine brass lamp swung upon chains from the painted ceiling. The  intricate perforations of the lamp were inset with colored glass, and  the result was a subdued and warm illumination. Odd-looking oriental  vessels, long-necked jars, jugs with tenuous spouts and squat bowls  possessing engraved and figured covers emerged from the shadows of  niches. A low divan with gaily colored mattresses extended from the  door around one corner of the room where it terminated beside a kind  of mushrabiyeh cabinet or cupboard. Beyond this cabinet was a long, low  counter laden with statuettes of Nile gods, amulets, mummy-beads and  little stoppered flasks of blue enamel ware. There were two glass cases  filled with other strange-looking antiquities. A faint perfume was  perceptible.    Sir Lucien entering last of the party, the door closed behind him, and  from the cabinet on the right of the divan a young Egyptian stepped  out. He wore the customary white robe, red sash and red slippers, and a  tarbush, the little scarlet cap commonly called a fez, was set upon  his head. He walked to a door on the left of the counter, and slid it  noiselessly open. Bowing gravely, \"The Sheikh el Kazmah awaits,\" he  said, speaking with the soft intonation of a native of Upper Egypt.    It now became evident, even to the infatuated Gray, that Mrs. Irvin was  laboring under the influence of tremendous excitement. She turned to him  quickly, and he thought that her face looked almost haggard, whilst her  eyes seemed to have changed color--become lighter, although he could  not be certain that this latter effect was not due to the peculiar  illumination of the room. But when she spoke her voice was unsteady.    \"Will you see if you can find a cab,\" she said. \"It is so difficult at  night, and my shoes will get frightfully muddy crossing Piccadilly. I  shall not be more than a few minutes.\" She walked through the doorway,  the Egyptian standing aside as she passed. He followed her, but came  out again almost immediately, reclosed the door, and retired into the  cabinet, which was evidently his private cubicle.    Silence claimed the apartment. Sir Lucien threw himself nonchalantly  upon the divan, and took out his cigarette-case.    \"Will you have a cigarette, Gray?\" he asked.    \"No thanks,\" replied the other, in tones of smothered hostility. He  was ill at ease, and paced the apartment nervously. Pyne lighted a  cigarette, and tossed the extinguished match into a brass bowl.    \"I think,\" said Gray jerkily, \"I shall go for a cab. Are you remaining?\"    \"I am dining at the club,\" answered Pyne, \"but I can wait until you  return.\"    \"As you wish,\" jerked Gray. \"I don't expect to be long.\"    He walked rapidly to the outer door, which opened at his approach and  closed noiselessly behind him as he made his exit.        CHAPTER III. KAZMAH    Mrs. Monte Irvin entered the inner room. The air was heavy with the  perfume of frankincense which smouldered in a brass vessel set upon a  tray. This was the audience chamber of Kazmah. In marked contrast to the  overcrowded appointments, divans and cupboards of the first room, it  was sparsely furnished. The floor was thickly carpeted, but save for an  ornate inlaid table upon which stood the tray and incense-burner, and  a long, low-cushioned seat placed immediately beneath a hanging lamp  burning dimly in a globular green shade, it was devoid of decoration.  The walls were draped with green curtains, so that except for the  presence of the painted door, the four sides of the apartment appeared  to be uniform.    Having conducted Mrs. Irvin to the seat, the Egyptian bowed and retired  again through the doorway by which they had entered. The visitor found  herself alone.    She moved nervously, staring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#2)"],[1,"ce,\" I said. \"That 'phone call was a hoax--\"    \"But I feel certain,\" declared Eltham, earnestly, \"that this is genuine!  The poor girl was dreadfully agitated; her master has broken his leg and  is lying helpless: number 280, Rectory Grove.\"    \"Where is the girl?\" I asked, sharply.    \"She ran back directly she had given me her message.\"    \"Was she a servant?\"    \"I should imagine so: French, I think. But she was so wrapped up I had  little more than a glimpse of her. I am sorry to hear that some one has  played a silly joke on you, but believe me--\" he was very earnest--\"this  is no jest. The poor girl could scarcely speak for sobs. She mistook me  for you, of course.\"    \"Oh!\" said I grimly, \"well, I suppose I must go. Broken leg, you  said?--and my surgical bag, splints and so forth, are at home!\"    \"My dear Petrie!\" cried Eltham, in his enthusiastic way--\"you no doubt  can do something to alleviate the poor man's suffering immediately. I  will run back to your rooms for the bag and rejoin you at 280, Rectory  Grove.\"    \"It's awfully good of you, Eltham--\"    He held up his hand.    \"The call of suffering humanity, Petrie, is one which I may no more  refuse to hear than you.\"    I made no further protest after that, for his point of view was evident  and his determination adamant, but told him where he would find the  bag and once more set out across the moonbright common, he pursuing a  westerly direction and I going east.    Some three hundred yards I had gone, I suppose, and my brain had been  very active the while, when something occurred to me which placed a new  complexion upon this second summons. I thought of the falsity of the  first, of the improbability of even the most hardened practical joker  practising his wiles at one o'clock in the morning. I thought of our  recent conversation; above all I thought of the girl who had delivered  the message to Eltham, the girl whom he had described as a French  maid--whose personal charm had so completely enlisted his sympathies.  Now, to this train of thought came a new one, and, adding it, my  suspicion became almost a certainty.    I remembered (as, knowing the district, I should have remembered before)  that there was no number 280 in Rectory Grove.    Pulling up sharply I stood looking about me. Not a living soul was  in sight; not even a policeman. Where the lamps marked the main paths  across the common nothing moved; in the shadows about me nothing  stirred. But something stirred within me--a warning voice which for long  had lain dormant.    What was afoot?    A breeze caressed the leaves overhead, breaking the silence with  mysterious whisperings. Some portentous truth was seeking for admittance  to my brain. I strove to reassure myself, but the sense of impending  evil and of mystery became heavier. At last I could combat my strange  fears no longer. I turned and began to run toward the south side of the  common--toward my rooms--and after Eltham.    I had hoped to head him off, but came upon no sign of him. An all-night  tramcar passed at the moment that I reached the high road, and as I ran  around behind it I saw that my windows were lighted and that there was a  light in the hall.    My key was yet in the lock when my housekeeper opened the door.    \"There's a gentleman just come, Doctor,\" she began--    I thrust past her and raced up the stairs into my study.    Standing by the writing-table was a tall, thin man, his gaunt face brown  as a coffee-berry and his steely gray eyes fixed upon me. My heart gave  a great leap--and seemed to stand still.    It was Nayland Smith!    \"Smith,\" I cried. \"Smith, old man, by God, I'm glad to see you!\"    He wrung my hand hard, looking at me with his searching eyes; but there  was little enough of gladness in his face. He was altogether grayer than  when last I had seen him--grayer and sterner.    \"Where is Eltham?\" I asked.    Smith started back as though I had struck him.    \"Eltham!\" he whispered--\"Eltham! is Eltham here?\"    \"I left him ten minutes ago on the common--\"    Smith dashed his right fist into the palm of his left hand and his eyes  gleamed almost wildly.    \"My God, Petrie!\" he said, \"am I fated always to come too late?\"    My dreadful fears in that instant were confirmed. I seemed to feel my  legs totter beneath me.    \"Smith, you don't mean--\"    \"I do, Petrie!\" His voice sounded very far away. \"Fu-Manchu is here; and  Eltham, God help him... is his first victim!\"        CHAPTER II. ELTHAM VANISHES    Smith went racing down the stairs like a man possessed. Heavy with such  a foreboding of calamity as I had not known for two years, I followed  him--along the hall and out into the road. The very peace and beauty of  the night in some way increased my mental agitation. The sky was lighted  almost tropically with such a blaze of stars as I could not recall to  have seen since, my futile search concluded, I had left Egypt. The glory  of the moonlight yellowed the lamps speckled across the expanse of  the common. The night was as still as night can ever be in London. The  dimming pulse of a cab or car alone disturbed the stillness.    With a quick glance to right and left, Smith ran across on to the  common, and, leaving the door wide open behind me, I followed. The path  which Eltham had pursued terminated almost opposite to my house. One's  gaze might follow it, white and empty, for several hundred yards past  the pond, and further, until it became overshadowed and was lost amid a  clump of trees.    I came up with Smith, and side by side we ran on, whilst pantingly, I  told my tale.    \"It was a trick to get you away from him!\" cried Smith. \"They meant no  doubt to make some attempt at your house, but as he came out with you,  an alternative plan--\"    Abreast of the pond, my companion slowed down, and finally stopped.    \"Where did you last see Eltham?\" he asked rapidly.    I took his arm, turning him slightly to the right, and pointed across  the moonbathed common.    \"You see that clump of bushes on the other side of the road?\" I said.  \"There's a path to the left of it. I took that path and he took this. We  parted at the point where they meet--\"    Smith walked right down to the edge of the water and peered about over  the surface.    What he hoped to find there I could not imagine. Whatever it had been he  was disappointed, and he turned to me again, frowning perplexedly, and  tugging at the lobe of his left ear, an old trick which reminded me of  gruesome things we had lived through in the past.    \"Come on,\" he jerked. \"It may be amongst the trees.\"    From the tone of his voice I knew that he was tensed up nervously, and  his mood but added to the apprehension of my own.    \"What may be amongst the trees, Smith?\" I asked.    He walked on.    \"God knows, Petrie; but I fear--\"    Behind us, along the highroad, a tramcar went rocking by, doubtless  bearing a few belated workers homeward. The stark incongruity of the  thing was appalling. How little those weary toilers, hemmed about  with the commonplace, suspected that almost within sight from the car  windows, in a place of prosy benches, iron railings, and unromantic,  flickering lamps, two fellow men moved upon the border of a horror-land!    Beneath the trees a shadow carpet lay, its edges tropically sharp; and  fully ten yards from the first of the group, we two, hatless both, and  sharing a common dread, paused for a moment and listened.    The car had stopped at the further extremity of the common, and now with  a moan that grew to a shriek was rolling on its way again. We stood  and listened until silence reclaimed the night. Not a footstep could be  heard. Then slowly we walked on. At the edge of the little coppice we  stopped again abruptly.    Smith turned and thrust his pistol into my hand. A white ray of light  pierced the shadows; my companion carried an electric torch. But no  trace of Eltham was discoverable.    There had been a heavy shower of rain during the evening just before  sunset, and although the open paths were dry again, under the trees  the ground was still moist. Ten yards within the coppice we came upon  tracks--the tracks of one running, as the deep imprints of the toes  indicated.    Abruptly the tracks terminated; others, softer, joined them, two sets  converging from left and right. There was a confused patch, trailing off  to the west; then this became indistinct, and was finally lost upon the  hard ground outside the group.    For perhaps a minute, or more, we ran about from tree to tree, and from  bush to bush, searching like hounds for a scent, and fearful of what we  might find. We found nothing; and fully in the moonlight we stood facing  one another. The night was profoundly still.    Nayland Smith stepped back into the shadows, and began slowly to turn  his head from left to right, taking in the entire visible expanse of the  common. Toward a point where the road bisected it he stared intently.  Then, with a bound, he set off.    \"Come on, Petrie!\" he cried. \"There they are!\"    Vaulting a railing he went away over a field like a madman. Recovering  from the shock of surprise, I followed him, but he was well ahead of me,  and making for some vaguely seen object moving against the lights of the  roadway.    Another railing was vaulted, and the corner of a second, triangular  grass patch crossed at a hot sprint. We were twenty yards from the road  when the sound of a starting motor broke the silence. We gained the  graveled footpath only to see the taillight of the car dwindling to the  north!    Smith leaned dizzily against a tree.    \"Eltham is in that car!\" he gasped. \"Just God! are we to stand here and  see him taken away to--\"    He beat his fist upon the tree, in a sort of tragic despair. The nearest  cab-rank was no great distance away, but, excluding the possibility of  no cab being there, it might, for all practical purposes, as well have  been a mile off.    The beat of the"]]]
