[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14419"],[0,"Grammatical Sketch of the Heve Language (#2)"],[1,"has been a disposition to omit the g also, the sound of which,  as in go, if the natives had not originally, they certainly possess  at present, got from the Spaniards. This should excuse its appearance  here. The sound of z is strong as heard in _fits_.    The vowels are sounded as in t_a_r, b_e_ar, s_i_lk, d_o_e, r_u_e.           *       *       *       *       *      PART II.    ETYMOLOGY.    SUBSTANTIVE.    _Substantives_ in this language are declined without the use of  articles.    2. Those which may be called _verbal_, from their origin in verbs,  are much used: hiósguadauh, painting, or writing, is the passive (is  painted) of the present active hiósguan, I paint. They have their  times: hiósguadauh is in the present, expressing the picture I form  now of the passive preterite hiósguacauh, the work I have executed, of  which hiósguatzidaugh, the picture I will make, is the future passive:  and when to these verbal substantives is added the particle gua, it  denotes place, as, No hiósguadaubgua, the place where I paint, etc.    GUA.    3. But words signifying kindred, have their termination usually in gua  also, for which see section 16.    SIVEN, RINA.    4, 5. _Other verbal substantives_, signifying instruments, are made  from the future active: thus, the verb métecan, I chop, having métetze  in the future, receives siven in lieu of the final syllable, and makes  the substantive, métesiven, axe or tool with which to chop. Many of  these words likewise terminate in rina, as bícusirina, flute, from  bícudan, I whistle, and bíhirina, shovel, from bihán, I scrape.    RAGUA, SURA.    6, 7. Many _abstract nouns_ are formed by the addition of the particle  ragua, as váde, joyously; váderagua, joy; déni, good; déniragua,  goodness; dóhme, man, or people; dóhmeragua, humanity; and so  diósragua, divinity. Others, substantive nouns, applied to certain  places end in súra, as, omásúra, canebrake, from om, cane, and súra,  in or among; huérigosúra, reedfield; húparosúra, mesquitscrub: and so  a town is called Opósúra, because it is among some trees called opó,  elm.    8. The _verbs are substantives_ likewise, and as such are declined as  much so as the same words are conjugated when verbs: thus, nemútzan,  I bewitch, is also wizard, and hiósguan, I write, is scrivener; but  it is to be observed of these substantives, as well as of those which  end in daugh, that they too have equally their times, as nemútzan,  the wizard--that is now, in the present; nemútzari, the preterite that  has; nemútzatze, the future that will, with the difference that these  terminations are active, while those in daugh, etc., are passive.           *       *       *       *       *      ADJECTIVE NOUNS.    TERI, EI, RAVE, E, I, O, U.    9, 10, 11, 12. The many _adjective nouns_ ending in téri, and ei,  signify quality, as, bavitéri, elegant; aresumetéri, different or  distinct; tasúquei, narrow; asóquei, thick; sútei, white; and so of  the rest signifying color. Some ending in ráve, denote plenitude; for  example, sitoráve, full of honey; composed of sitóri, honey, and ráve,  full; seborráve, full of flies; ateráve of até, louse, etc.; others,  ending in e, i, o, u, signify possession, as, esé, she that has  petticoats; cúne, she that has a husband; guásue, he that has land for  planting; húvi, the married man, from hub, woman; nóno, he that has  a father, from nónogua, father, and sutúu, he that has finger-nails,  from sutú: and they, moreover, have their times like verbs, since,  from esé is formed esei, preterite, she that had petticoats; cúnetze,  future, she that will marry, etc.; and afterwards they are declined  as nouns, as, _Nom._, eséi; _Gen._ eséigue. (For other form of the  possessive, see section 19.)    CA, SARI, SCOR, SGUARI.    13, 14. It is usual for the want of many positive affirmatives in the  language to express by the positive of the opposite signification,  adding the negation ca, as, nucuatéri, perishable; canucuatéri,  everlasting; cúne, married, f.; cacúne, not married; húbi, married,  m.; cahúbi, not married, etc. Those ending in sári, and scor, mark a  bad, or vicious quality, as, dedensári, tobacco-smoker, from déinan, I  suck; and hibesári, gluttonous, from hibáan, I eat; nehrisári, talker,  from néhren, I talk; capasári, old rags, from capát; baníscor, weeper,  from báanan; cotzíscor, sleeper, from cotzom; dióscor, vagabond, from  dion, I walk, or vacosári, which has the same signification, from  vácon. The termination, sguari, is used in this sense: dotzi, old man;  dotzísguari, very old man; hóit, female of middle age; hoísguari, very  old woman.      DECLENSION.    Substantives of the First Declension form their genitive in _que_, and  usually are such as terminate in a vowel.      _Nominative_, Siibì, hawk,    _Genitive_, Sìiibíque, of hawk,    _Dative_, Siibt, to hawk,    _Accusative_, Siibìe, hawk,    _Vocative_, Siibì, hawk,    _Ablative_, Sibítze, in     \\                Sibíde, by       > hawk.                Sibíquema, with /    The plural of substantives (requiring a special notice) will be  treated of hereafter. Substantives of the Second Declension form their  genitive in _te_ and _t_.      _N._ Mavirot, Lion.    _G._ Mavirote,    _D. and A._ Mavírota,    _V._ Mavírot,    _A._ Mavírotze, in,         Mavírode, by,         Mavírotema, with lion.      The verb-noun hiósguadauh, painting, is thus declined.      _N._ Hiósgnadauh,    _G._ Hiósguadauhte,    _D. and A._ Hiósguadauhta,    _Ab._ Hiósguadautze, in,          Hiósguadauhde, by,          Hiósguadauhtema, with painting.    And so likewise decline the preterite passive hiósguacauh, and the  future passive hiósguatzidauh.    But verbs in the present time, when they serve as substantives, are  thus declined      _N._ Nemútzan, wizard.    _G._ Nemútzante,    _D. and A._ Nemútzanta,    _V._ Nemútzan,    _A._ Nemútzantze, in,         Nemútzade, by,         Nemútzantema, with wizard.    Some ending in _t_ while they form the genitive in _te_, part with a  vowel, as follows:      _N._ Arit, Ant.    _G._ Arte,    _D. and A._ Arta,    _V._ Arit;    _A._ Artze, in,         Arde, by,         Artema, with ant.    Nónoguat, father, belongs to this declension, and forms the genitive  nónauhte; but when preceded by a possessive pronoun, it loses the  final guat, as has been stated, and the termination is left in _o_, to  form the genitive in the first declension, as, no, my, no nónoque, of  my father, which rule applies equally to other names of kindred.    Sometimes an ablative is formed in _u_, as teópatu, in the church,  from teópa, hecátu, in the shade, from hecát.    Substantives of the Third Declension end in _s_, _r_, _z_, and form  the genitive by the addition of _e_, and the accusative by _i_.      _N._ Utzvor, Pitahaya.    _G._ Utzv[=o]re,    _D. and A._ Utzvori,    _V._ Utzvor,    _A._ Utzvortze, in,         Utzvorde, by,         Utzvorema, with pitahaya.    In this way decline tatas, crabapple,--gen. tatáse, dat. and acc.  tatási, &c., also, porótz, wildcat, gen. porótze, dat. and acc.  porótzi, &c.    To Adjective Nouns there has been an inclination to assign a separate  place, but they terminate _in a vowel_, and there appears to be  no reason why they should not go with substantives of the first  declension.        _N._ Sóvei, obscure.      _G._ Sóveique,      _D. and A._ Sóvec,    _V._ Sóvei,      _A._ Sóvetze in,           Sóveide, by,           Sóveiquema, with obscure.    OF THE PLURAL.    15. Substantives, especially those animate of rational beings, usually  form the plural by doubling the first syllable, as, dor, man, or male;  dódor, men; hoit, woman, pl. hóhoit; déni, good, pl. dedéni.    Some other words form their plural irregularly, as, doritzi, boy,  pl. vus, applied to both sexes, though when intended only for males  dódorus is used; hoquis, large girls, pl. hórquir; temátzi, big boy,  pl. tetemtzi; to which when the particle _te_ is added it marks the  absence of any of the other sex, as dodórte, men only; hohóite,  women only; hórquirte, girls only. The declension of these plurals is  according to the rules before given.    OF KINDRED.    16. The language is remarkable for another peculiarity, which is, that  the females in many instances employ different words from the males:  the father says to his son, Nognàt, to his daughter, Mórqua; the  mother to either says, Nótzgua; the son to the father says, Nonógua,  and the daughter says, Mósgua. The elder brother likewise is called  Vátzgua, pl. Vapàtz, the younger Vángua, pl. Vopon, the elder sister  Cotzgua, pl. Cocátz, the younger Víngua, pl. Vipim, to which adding  the possessive pronouns no, amo, and the like, the gua is omitted to  such as have that termination. There is much to be learned about the  names of the kindred, but the subject is one too wide for present  explanation.    PRONOUNS.    17. The _Personal Pronoun_ nee, I, followed by another word becomes  ne; nap, thou or you, becomes na, tamide becomes ta; emet or emíde  becomes em, veride and iride become ver and ir; meride becomes mer.              SINGULAR.                        PLURAL.      _Nom._ Nee, I,                        Tamide, we,    _Gen._ No, of me,                     Tamo, of us,    _Dat. and Acc._ Netz, to me,          Tame, to us,    _Voc._ (if there be any,) Nee, O,     Tamide, O we,    _Abl._ Noma, with me,                 Tamóma, with us,    Node, by me;                           Tamóde, by us.  the ma in this case being that of cause, manner and instrument.      _N._ Nap, thou,                       Emet, or Emíde, ye,    _G._ Amo, of thee,                    Emo, of you,    _D. and A._ Eme, to thee,             Emé, to you,    _V._ Nap, O thou,                     Emèt, O ye,    _Ab._ Amóma, with thee,               Emóma, with you,            Amóde, by thee,               Emóde, by you.      _N._ Veride, or Iride, this,          Meride, these,    _G._ Vére, of this,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#2)"],[1," such a draggle-tailed  divinity. An important feature in the ritual which he prescribes is the  shaving and ducking of all who have not passed the line before. But our  attitude was strictly Erastian, and the demigod retired discomfited to  the second class, where from the sounds which arose he seemed to find  more punctilious votaries. On the 23rd we sighted a sail--or rather the  smoke of another steamer. As the comparatively speedy 'Dunottar Castle'  overtook the stranger everybody's interest was aroused. Under the  scrutiny of many brand-new telescopes and field glasses--for all want to  see as much of a war as possible--she developed into the 'Nineveh,'  hired transport carrying the Australian Lancers to the Cape. Signals  were exchanged. The vessels drew together, and after an hour's steaming  we passed her almost within speaking distance. The General went up to  the bridge. The Lancers crowded the bulwarks and rigging of the  'Nineveh' and one of them waggled a flag violently. An officer on our  ship replied with a pocket-handkerchief. The Australians asked  questions: 'Is Sir Redvers Buller on board?' The answer 'Yes' was  signalled back, and immediately the Lancers gave three tremendous  cheers, waving their broad-brimmed hats and gesticulating with energy  while the steam siren emitted a frantic whoop of salutation. Then the  speed of the larger vessel told, and we drew ahead of the transport  until her continued cheers died away. She signalled again: 'What won the  Cesarewitch?' But the distance was now too great for us to learn whether  the answer gave satisfaction or not.    We have a party of cinematographers on board, and when they found that  we were going to speak the 'Nineveh' they bustled about preparing their  apparatus. But the cumbrous appliances took too long to set up, and, to  the bitter disappointment of the artists, the chance of making a moving  picture was lost for ever; and indeed it was a great pity, because the  long green transport, pitching in the sea, now burying her bows in foam,  now showing the red paint of her bottom, her decks crowded with the  active brown figures of the soldiers, her halyards bright with signal  flags, was a scene well worth recording even if it had not been the  greeting given in mid-ocean to the commander of the army by the warlike  contingent which the need or convenience of the Empire had drawn from  the Antipodes.    South of the line the weather cools rapidly, and various theories are  advanced to explain the swift change. According to some, it is due to  the masses of ice at the Antarctic Pole; others contend that it is  because we are further from the land. But whatever the cause may be, the  fall in temperature produces a rise in spirits, and under greyer skies  everyone develops activity. The consequence of this is the organisation  of athletic sports. A committee is appointed. Sir Redvers Buller becomes  President. A two days' meeting is arranged, and on successive afternoons  the more energetic passengers race violently to and fro on the decks,  belabour each other with bolsters, or tumble into unforeseen troughs of  water to their huge contentment and the diversion of the rest.    Occasionally there are light gusts of controversy. It is Sunday. The  parson proposes to read the service. The captain objects. He insists on  the maintenance of naval supremacy. On board ship, 'or at any rate on  board this ship,' no one but the captain reads the service. The  minister, a worthy Irishman, abandons the dispute--not without regret.  'Any other clergyman of the Church of England,' he observes with warmth,  'would have told the captain to go to Hell.'    Then there is to be a fancy dress ball. Opinions are divided. On the one  part it is urged that fancy dress balls are healthy and amusing. On the  other, that they are exceedingly tiresome. The discussion is prolonged.  In the end the objectors are overruled--still objecting. Such are the  politics of the State.    Inoculation against enteric fever proceeds daily. The doctors lecture in  the saloon. One injection of serum protects; a second secures the  subject against attacks. Wonderful statistics are quoted in support of  the experiment. Nearly everyone is convinced. The operations take place  forthwith, and the next day sees haggard forms crawling about the deck  in extreme discomfort and high fever. The day after, however, all have  recovered and rise gloriously immune. Others, like myself, remembering  that we still stand only on the threshold of pathology, remain  unconvinced, resolved to trust to 'health and the laws of health.' But  if they will, invent a system of inoculation against bullet wounds I  will hasten to submit myself.    Yesterday we passed a homeward-bound liner, who made great efforts to  signal to us, but as she was a Union boat the captain refused to go near  enough to read the flags, and we still remain ignorant of the state of  the war. If the great lines of steamships to the Cape were to compete  against each other, as do those of the Atlantic, by increasing their  speeds, by lowering their rates, by improving the food and  accommodation, no one would complain, but it is difficult to see how the  public can be the gainers by the silly antagonism I have described.  However, the end is drawing very near, and since we have had a safe and  prosperous journey criticism may well waive the opportunity. Yet there  are few among the travellers who will not experience a keen feeling of  relief in exchanging the pettiness, the monotony, and the isolation of  the voyage for the activity of great enterprise and the interest of real  affairs: a relief which may, perhaps, be shared by the reader of these  letters. Yet if he has found the account of a dull voyage dull, he  should not complain; for is not that successful realism?      October 29.    News at last! This morning we sighted a sail--a large homeward-bound  steamer, spreading her canvas to catch the trades, and with who should  say what tidings on board. We crowded the decks, and from every point of  view telescopes, field glasses, and cameras were directed towards the  stranger. She passed us at scarcely two hundred yards, and as she did so  her crew and company, giving three hearty cheers, displayed a long black  board, on which was written in white paint: 'Boers defeated; three  battles; Penn Symons killed.' There was a little gasp of excitement.  Everyone stepped back from the bulwarks. Those who had not seen ran  eagerly up to ask what had happened. A dozen groups were formed, a hum  of conversation arose, and meanwhile the vessels separated--for the pace  of each was swift--and in a few moments the homeward bound lay far in  our wake.    What does it mean--this scrap of intelligence which tells so much and  leaves so much untold? To-morrow night we shall know all. This at least  is certain: there has been fierce fighting in Natal, and, under Heaven,  we have held our own: perhaps more. 'Boers defeated.' Let us thank God  for that. The brave garrisons have repelled the invaders. The luck has  turned at last. The crisis is over, and the army now on the seas may  move with measured strides to effect a final settlement that is both  wise and just. In that short message eighteen years of heartburnings are  healed. The abandoned colonist, the shamed soldier, the 'cowardly  Englishman,' the white flag, the 'How about Majuba?'--all gone for ever.  At last--'the Boers defeated.' Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!    So Sir Penn Symons is killed! Well, no one would have laid down his life  more gladly in such a cause. Twenty years ago the merest chance saved  him from the massacre at Isandhlwana, and Death promoted him in an  afternoon from subaltern to senior captain. Thenceforward his rise was  rapid. He commanded the First Division of the Tirah Expeditionary Force  among the mountains with prudent skill. His brigades had no misfortunes:  his rearguards came safely into camp. In the spring of 1898, when the  army lay around Fort Jumrood, looking forward to a fresh campaign, I  used often to meet him. Everyone talked of Symons, of his energy, of his  jokes, of his enthusiasm. It was Symons who had built a racecourse on  the stony plain; who had organised the Jumrood Spring Meeting; who won  the principal event himself, to the delight of the private soldiers,  with whom he was intensely popular; who, moreover, was to be first and  foremost if the war with the tribes broke out again; and who was  entrusted with much of the negotiations with their _jirgas_. Dinner with  Symons in the mud tower of Jumrood Fort was an experience. The memory  of many tales of sport and war remains. At the end the General would  drink the old Peninsular toasts: 'Our Men,' 'Our Women,' 'Our Religion,'  'Our Swords,' 'Ourselves,' 'Sweethearts and Wives,' and 'Absent  Friends'--one for every night in the week. The night when I dined the  toast was 'Our Men.' May the State in her necessities find others like  him!          CHAPTER II    THE STATE OF THE GAME      Cape Town: November 1, 1899.    The long-drawn voyage came to an end at last. On the afternoon of  October 30 we sighted land, and looking westward I perceived what looked  like a dark wave of water breaking the smooth rim of the horizon. A  short time developed the wave into the rocks and slopes of Robben  Island--a barren spot inhabited by lepers, poisonous serpents, and dogs  undergoing quarantine. Then with the darkness we entered Table Bay, and,  steaming slowly, reached the anchorage at ten o'clock. Another hour of  waiting followed until the tugboat obeyed the signal; but at last she  ran alongside, and there stepped on board a Man Who Knew. Others with  despatches pushed roughly through the crowd of soldiers, officers,  passengers, and war correspondents to the General's cabin. We caught the  Man Who Knew, however, and, setting him half way up the ladder to the  hurricane deck, required him"]]]
