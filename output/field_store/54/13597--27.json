[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"in a flat on the North Side--first on Chicago  Avenue, something over a mile from the office, later on in another  flat further north, on La Salle Avenue, and still later, and until he  went to Europe, in a small rented house on Crilly Place, which is a  few blocks west of the south end of Lincoln Park.    By arrangement with the business office, Field's salary was paid to  Mrs. Field weekly, she having the management of the finances of the  family. Field, Ballantyne, and I were the high-priced members of the  News staff at that time, but our pay was not princely, and two of us  were engaged in a constant conspiracy to jack it up to a level more  nearly commensurate, as we \"opined,\" with our respective needs and  worth. The third member of the trio, who personally sympathized with  our aspirations and acknowledged their justice, occupied an executive  position, where he was expected to exercise the most rigorous economy.  Moreover, he had a Scotsman's stern and brutal sense of his duty to  get the best work for the least expenditure of his employer's money.  It was not until Field and I learned that Messrs. Lawson & Stone were  more appreciative of the value of our work that our salaries gradually  rose above the level where Ballantyne would have condemned them to  remain forever in the sacred name of economy.    I have said that Field's weekly salary--\"stipend,\" he called it--was  paid regularly to Mrs. Field. I should have said that she received all  of it that the ingenious and impecunious Eugene had not managed to  forestall. Not a week went by that he did not tax the fertility of his  active brain to wheedle Collins Shackelford, the cashier, into  breaking into his envelope for five or ten dollars in advance. These  appeals came in every form that Field's fecundity could invent. When  all other methods failed the presence of \"Pinny\" or \"Melvin\" in the  office would afford a messenger and plan of action that was always  crowned with success. \"Pinny\" especially seemed to enter into his  father's schemes to move Shackelford's sympathy with the greatest  success. He was also very effective in moving Mr. Stone to a  consideration of Field's requests for higher pay.    In his \"Eugene Field I Knew,\" Francis Wilson has preserved a number of  these touching \"notes\" to Shackelford, in prose and verse, but none of  them equals in the shrewd, seductive style, of which Field was master,  the following, which was composed with becoming hilarity and presented  with befitting solemnity:      _A SONNET TO SHEKELSFORD      Sweet Shekelsford, the week is near its end,      And, as my custom is, I come to thee;    There is no other who has pelf to lend,      At least no pelf to lend to hapless me;    Nay, gentle Shekelsford, turn not away--    I must have wealth, for this is Saturday.      Ah, now thou smil'st a soft relenting smile--      Thy previous frown was but a passing joke,    I knew thy heart would melt with pity while      Thou heardst me pleading I was very broke.    Nay, ask me not if I've a note from Stone,      When I approach thee, O thou best of men!    I bring no notes, but, boldly and alone,      I woo sweet hope and strike thee for a ten.      December 3d, 1884._    There is no mistaking the touch of the author of \"Mr. Billings of  Louisville\" in these lines, in which humor and flattery robbed the  injunction of Mr. Stone against advancing anything on Field's salary  of its binding force. Having once learned the key that would unlock  the cashier's box, he never let a week go by without turning it to  some profitable account. But it is only fair to say that he never  abused his influence over Mr. Shackelford to lighten the weekly  envelope by more than the \"necessary V\" or the \"sorely needed X.\"    I have dwelt upon these conditions because they explain to some extent  our relations, and why, after we had entered upon our study of early  English ballads and the chronicles of knights and tourneys, Field  always referred to himself as \"the good but impecunious Knight,  _sans peur et sans monnaie_,\" while I was \"Sir Slosson,\" \"Nompy,\"  or \"Grimesey,\" as the particular roguery he was up to suggested.    It was while I was visiting my family in the province of New  Brunswick, in the fall of 1884, that I received the initial evidence  of a particular line of attack in which Field delighted to show his  friendship and of which he never wearied. It came in shape of an  office postal card addressed in extenso, \"For Mr. Alexander Slason  Thompson, Fredericton, New Brunswick\"--the employment of the baptismal  \"Alexander\" being intended to give zest to the joke with the postal  officials in my native town. The communication to which the attention  of the curious was invited by its form read:      CHICAGO, October 6th, 1884.      GRIMESEY:      Come at once. We are starving! Come and bring your wallet with you.      EUGENE F----D.    JOHN F. B----E.    Of course the postmaster at Fredericton read the message, and I was  soon conscious that a large part of the community was consumed with  curiosity as to my relations with my starving correspondents.    But this served merely as a prelude to what was to follow. My visit  was cut short by an assignment from the Daily News to visit various  towns in Maine to interview the prominent men who had become  interested, through James G. Blaine, in the Little Rock securities  which played such a part in the presidential campaigns of 1876 and  1884. For ten days I roved all over the state, making my headquarters  at the Hotel North, Augusta, where I was bombarded with postal cards  from Field. They were all couched in ambiguous terms and were well  calculated to impress the inquisitive hotel clerk with the impecuniosity  of my friends and with the suspicion that I was in some way responsible  for their desperate condition. Autograph hunters have long ago stripped  me of most of these letters of discredit, but the following, which has  escaped the importunity of collectors of Fieldiana, will indicate their  general tenor:      CHICAGO, October 10th, 1884.      If you do not hasten back we shall starve. Harry Powers has come to    our rescue several times, but is beginning to weaken, and the    outlook is very dreary. If you cannot come yourself, please send    certified check.      Yours hungrily,      E.F.    J.F.B.    The same postal importunities awaited me at the Parker House while in  Boston, and came near spoiling the negotiations in which I was engaged,  for the News, for the, till then, unpublished correspondence between  Mr. Blaine and Mr. Fischer, of the Mulligan letters notoriety. My  assignment as staff correspondent called for visits to New York,  Albany, and Buffalo on my way home, and wherever I stopped I found  proofs that Field was possessed of my itinerary and was bound that I  should not escape his embarrassing attentions.    There is no need to tell that of all anniversaries of the year  Christmas was the one that appealed most strongly to Eugene Field's  heart and ever-youthful fancy. It was in his mind peculiarly the  children's festival, and his books bear all the testimony that is  needed, from the first poem he acknowledged, \"Christmas Treasures,\" to  the last word he wrote, that it filled his heart with rejoicings and  love and good will. But there is an incident in our friendship which  shows how he managed to weave in with the blessed spirit of Christmas  the elfish, cheery spirit of his own.    We had spent Christmas Eve, 1884, together, and, as usual, had expended  our last dime in providing small tokens of remembrance for everyone  within the circle of our immediate friends. I parted from him at the  midnight car, which he took for the North Side. Going to the Sherman  House, I caught the last elevator for my room on the top floor, and it  was not long ere I was oblivious to all sublunary things.    Before it was fairly light the next morning I was disturbed and finally  awakened by the sound of voices and subdued tittering in the corridor  outside my door. Then there came a knock, and I was told that there was  a message for me. Opening the door, my eyes were greeted with a huge  home-knit stocking tacked to it with a two-pronged fork and filled with  a collection of conventional presents for a boy--a fair idea of which  the reader can glean from the following lines in Field's handwriting  dangling from the toe:      _I prithee, gentle traveller, pause    And view the work of Santa Claus.    Behold this sock that's brimming o'er    With good things near our Slason's door;    Before he went to bed last night    He paddled out in robe of white,    And hung this sock upon the wall    Prepared for Santa Claus's call.    And said, \"Come, Santa Claus, and bring    Some truck to fill this empty thing.\"    Then back he went and locked the door,    And soon was lost in dream and snore.      The Saint arrived at half-past one--    Behold how well his work is done:    See what a wealth of food and toy    He brought unto the sleeping boy:    An apple, fig, and orange, too,    A jumping-jack of carmine hue,    A book, some candy, and a cat,    Two athletes in a wrestling spat,    A nervous monkey on a stick,    And honey cake that's hard and thick.    Oh, what a wealth of joy is here    To thrill the soul of Slason dear!      Touch not a thing, but leave them all    Within this sock upon the wall;    So when he wakes and comes, he may    Find all these toys and trinkets gay,    And thank old Santa that he came    Up all these stairs with all this game._    If I have succeeded in conveying any true impression of Eugene Field's  nature, the reader can imagine the pleasure he derived from this game,  in planning it, in providing the old-fashioned sock, toys, and  eatables, and in toiling up six flights of stairs after he knew I was  asleep, to see that everything was arranged so as to attract the  attention of the passing traveller. The success of his game was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#2)"],[1,"Europe.  I did try to found a heresy of my own;  and when I had put the last touches to it, I discovered that it  was orthodoxy.         It may be that somebody will be entertained by the account  of this happy fiasco.  It might amuse a friend or an enemy to  read how I gradually learnt from the truth of some stray legend  or from the falsehood of some dominant philosophy, things that I  might have learnt from my catechism--if I had ever learnt it.  There may or may not be some entertainment in reading how I  found at last in an anarchist club or a Babylonian temple what I  might have found in the nearest parish church.  If any one is  entertained by learning how the flowers of the field or the  phrases in an omnibus, the accidents of politics or the pains  of youth came together in a certain order to produce a certain  conviction of Christian orthodoxy, he may possibly read this book.  But there is in everything a reasonable division of labour.  I have written the book, and nothing on earth would induce me to read it.         I add one purely pedantic note which comes, as a note  naturally should, at the beginning of the book.  These essays are  concerned only to discuss the actual fact that the central Christian  theology (sufficiently summarized in the Apostles' Creed) is the  best root of energy and sound ethics.  They are not intended  to discuss the very fascinating but quite different question  of what is the present seat of authority for the proclamation  of that creed.  When the word \"orthodoxy\" is used here it means  the Apostles' Creed, as understood by everybody calling himself  Christian until a very short time ago and the general historic  conduct of those who held such a creed.  I have been forced by  mere space to confine myself to what I have got from this creed;  I do not touch the matter much disputed among modern Christians,  of where we ourselves got it.  This is not an ecclesiastical treatise  but a sort of slovenly autobiography.  But if any one wants my  opinions about the actual nature of the authority, Mr. G.S.Street  has only to throw me another challenge, and I will write him another book.        II THE MANIAC           Thoroughly worldly people never understand even the world;  they rely altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not true.  Once I remember walking with a prosperous publisher, who made  a remark which I had often heard before; it is, indeed, almost a  motto of the modern world.  Yet I had heard it once too often,  and I saw suddenly that there was nothing in it.  The publisher  said of somebody, \"That man will get on; he believes in himself.\"  And I remember that as I lifted my head to listen, my eye caught  an omnibus on which was written \"Hanwell.\"  I said to him,  \"Shall I tell you where the men are who believe most in themselves?  For I can tell you.  I know of men who believe in themselves more  colossally than Napoleon or Caesar.  I know where flames the fixed  star of certainty and success.  I can guide you to the thrones of  the Super-men. The men who really believe in themselves are all in  lunatic asylums.\"  He said mildly that there were a good many men after  all who believed in themselves and who were not in lunatic asylums.  \"Yes, there are,\" I retorted, \"and you of all men ought to know them.  That drunken poet from whom you would not take a dreary tragedy,  he believed in himself.  That elderly minister with an epic from  whom you were hiding in a back room, he believed in himself.  If you consulted your business experience instead of your ugly  individualistic philosophy, you would know that believing in himself  is one of the commonest signs of a rotter.  Actors who can't  act believe in themselves; and debtors who won't pay.  It would  be much truer to say that a man will certainly fail, because he  believes in himself.  Complete self-confidence is not merely a sin;  complete self-confidence is a weakness.  Believing utterly in one's  self is a hysterical and superstitious belief like believing in  Joanna Southcote:  the man who has it has `Hanwell' written on his  face as plain as it is written on that omnibus.\"  And to all this  my friend the publisher made this very deep and effective reply,  \"Well, if a man is not to believe in himself, in what is he to believe?\"  After a long pause I replied, \"I will go home and write a book in answer  to that question.\"  This is the book that I have written in answer  to it.         But I think this book may well start where our argument started--  in the neighbourhood of the mad-house. Modern masters of science are  much impressed with the need of beginning all inquiry with a fact.  The ancient masters of religion were quite equally impressed with  that necessity.  They began with the fact of sin--a fact as practical  as potatoes.  Whether or no man could be washed in miraculous  waters, there was no doubt at any rate that he wanted washing.  But certain religious leaders in London, not mere materialists,  have begun in our day not to deny the highly disputable water,  but to deny the indisputable dirt.  Certain new theologians dispute  original sin, which is the only part of Christian theology which can  really be proved.  Some followers of the Reverend R.J.Campbell, in  their almost too fastidious spirituality, admit divine sinlessness,  which they cannot see even in their dreams.  But they essentially  deny human sin, which they can see in the street.  The strongest  saints and the strongest sceptics alike took positive evil as the  starting-point of their argument.  If it be true (as it certainly is)  that a man can feel exquisite happiness in skinning a cat,  then the religious philosopher can only draw one of two deductions.  He must either deny the existence of God, as all atheists do; or he  must deny the present union between God and man, as all Christians do.  The new theologians seem to think it a highly rationalistic solution  to deny the cat.         In this remarkable situation it is plainly not now possible  (with any hope of a universal appeal) to start, as our fathers did,  with the fact of sin.  This very fact which was to them (and is to me)  as plain as a pikestaff, is the very fact that has been specially  diluted or denied.  But though moderns deny the existence of sin,  I do not think that they have yet denied the existence of a  lunatic asylum.  We all agree still that there is a collapse of  the intellect as unmistakable as a falling house.  Men deny hell,  but not, as yet, Hanwell.  For the purpose of our primary argument  the one may very well stand where the other stood.  I mean that as  all thoughts and theories were once judged by whether they tended  to make a man lose his soul, so for our present purpose all modern  thoughts and theories may be judged by whether they tend to make  a man lose his wits.         It is true that some speak lightly and loosely of insanity  as in itself attractive.  But a moment's thought will show that if  disease is beautiful, it is generally some one else's disease.  A blind man may be picturesque; but it requires two eyes to see  the picture.  And similarly even the wildest poetry of insanity can  only be enjoyed by the sane.  To the insane man his insanity is  quite prosaic, because it is quite true.  A man who thinks himself  a chicken is to himself as ordinary as a chicken.  A man who thinks  he is a bit of glass is to himself as dull as a bit of glass.  It is the homogeneity of his mind which makes him dull, and which  makes him mad.  It is only because we see the irony of his idea  that we think him even amusing; it is only because he does not see  the irony of his idea that he is put in Hanwell at all.  In short,  oddities only strike ordinary people.  Oddities do not strike  odd people.  This is why ordinary people have a much more exciting time;  while odd people are always complaining of the dulness of life.  This is also why the new novels die so quickly, and why the old  fairy tales endure for ever.  The old fairy tale makes the hero  a normal human boy; it is his adventures that are startling;  they startle him because he is normal.  But in the modern  psychological novel the hero is abnormal; the centre is not central.  Hence the fiercest adventures fail to affect him adequately,  and the book is monotonous.  You can make a story out of a hero  among dragons; but not out of a dragon among dragons.  The fairy  tale discusses what a sane man will do in a mad world.  The sober  realistic novel of to-day discusses what an essential lunatic will  do in a dull world.         Let us begin, then, with the mad-house; from this evil and fantastic  inn let us set forth on our intellectual journey.  Now, if we are  to glance at the philosophy of sanity, the first thing to do in the  matter is to blot out one big and common mistake.  There is a notion  adrift everywhere that imagination, especially mystical imagination,  is dangerous to man's mental balance.  Poets are commonly spoken of as  psychologically unreliable; and generally there is a vague association  between wreathing laurels in your hair and sticking straws in it.  Facts and history utterly contradict this view.  Most of the very  great poets have been not only sane, but extremely business-like;  and if Shakespeare ever really held horses, it was because he was much  the safest man to hold them.  Imagination does not breed insanity.  Exactly what does breed insanity is reason.  Poets do not go mad;  but chess-players do.  Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers;  but creative artists very seldom.  I am not, as will be seen,  in any sense attacking logic:  I only say that this danger does  lie in logic, not in imagination.  Artistic paternity is as  wholesome as physical paternity.  Moreover, it is worthy of remark  that when a poet really was morbid it was commonly because he had  some weak spot of rationality on his brain.  Poe, for instance,  really was morbid; not because"]]]
