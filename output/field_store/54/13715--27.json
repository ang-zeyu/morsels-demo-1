(9)    ELEMENTARY SOUNDS    Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and  of their combinations.    An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of  speech.    The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,  Subvocals, and Aspirates.    Vocals are those sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most  prominent elements of speech. A diphthong is a union of two vocals,  commencing with one and ending with the other.    Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less  obstructed.    Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.      VOCALS.    DIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.    1. Let the mouth be open, and the teeth, tongue, and palate in their  proper position.    2. Pronounce the word in the CHART forcibly, and with the falling  inflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or  aspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals  alone.      TABLE.    Long Vocals.    Sound   Word    Sound   Word  a       hate    e       err  a       hare    i       pine  a       far     o       no  a       pass    u       tube  a       fall    u       burn  e       eve     oo      cool    Short Vocals.

The difference  consists chiefly in quantity. As a rule, the long vocals should be  prolonged with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals should be  uttered sharply and almost explosively.    Diphthongs.    oi, oy, as in coin, boy.        ou, ow, as in noun, now.      SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.    DIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.    Pronounce distinctly and forcibly, several times in succession, words in  which these sounds occur as elements; then drop the other sounds, and  repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Each subvocal in the first table  should be practiced in connection with its cognate sound.    Let the class repeat the words and elements, at first in concert; then  separately.    Select words ending with subvocal sounds for practice on subvocals; words  beginning or ending with aspirate sounds, for practice on aspirates.      COGNATE SOUNDS.    Subvocals               Aspirates  Sound  Example          Sound   Example  b      babe             p       rap  d      rod              t       at  g      fog              k       book  j      judge            ch      chat  v      live             f       file  th     them             th      myth  z      buzz             s       sink  zh     azure            sh      shine  w      win              wh      when      REMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognate sounds. In  articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position as  required for the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the  breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal  sound. Let the pupil verify this by experiment, and then practice on these  cognates.    The following sounds are not cognates.    SUB VOCALS.

Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented  by other characters. The following table indicates nearly every form of  substitution used in the language: a few exceptional cases only are  omitted      TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.

But perhaps the dear child may suffer less in hearing the  sad news from her mother's lips, as, in her place, I could bear it better  from yours than from any other.\"    \"Unselfish as ever, my darling,\" he said, \"but I believe you are  right--that the blow will be somewhat softened to Elsie coming to her  through the medium of her tender and dearly loved mother.\"    \"I think, papa,\" Mrs. Travilla said, checking her horse to a walk as they  entered the avenue at Ion, \"I shall reserve my communication until my poor  child has had her breakfast.\"    He expressed approval of her decision, adding interrogatively, \"You will  breakfast with the family this morning?\"    \"Yes, sir; if I find all going well in the sick-room.\"    A servant was in waiting to lead the horses away to the stable. Violet,  Edward, Harold and Herbert, just returned from their ride, were on the  veranda.    Edward hastened to assist his mother to alight, and all gathered about her  and their grandfather with morning greetings spoken in cheerful but  subdued tones; no one forgetting for a moment the illness of the little  pet brother and sister, but all inquiring anxiously how they and \"Mamma\"  had passed the night, and what was cousin Arthur's report of their  condition this morning.    \"No worse, my dears; and we will hope that they may soon be decidedly  better,\" the mother answered, returning their greetings with affectionate  warmth and smiling sweetly upon them. \"But you must let me go at once to  the sick-room, and if all is well I shall be down presently to breakfast  with grandpa and you.\"    That announcement was heard with the greater pleasure because her loved  face had seldom been seen at the table for some days past.    The face was bright and hopeful as she spoke, but an unwonted expression  of sadness and anxiety came over it as she turned quickly away and went  swiftly through the spacious entrance hall and up the broad stairway.    No earthly eye saw that look, but the traces of tears on her mother's  cheeks had not escaped Vi's keen observation.    \"Grandpa,\" she said in low, tremulous tones, following him into the  library, whither he went to await the summons to breakfast, \"what has  been distressing mamma so? is it that she is so anxious about Elsie and  Walter? May I not know?\"    Mr. Dinsmore paused a moment before he replied. \"You shall know all about  it, my dear child, before very long. Be satisfied for the present with the  assurance that your mother's distress is for another's woe. You know what  a tender, sympathetic heart she has. I cannot deny that our little ones  are seriously ill, but their case is very far from hopeless.\"          CHAPTER II.                           \"Within her heart was his image,      Cloth'd in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,      Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.\"                                              --_Longfellow_.      The sick ones ware sleeping quietly when the mother entered; the doctor  had already breakfasted, and would assist Aunt Chloe and Dinah in watching  beside them for the next hour, so the two Elsies--mother and  daughter--went down together to the breakfast parlor.    They were a more silent party than usual at meal-time, for no one could  forget the two absent members of the family, or that they were suffering  upon beds of sickness; yet there was no gloom in any face or voice: their  few words were spoken in cheerful tones, and each seemed unselfishly  intent upon promoting the comfort and happiness of all the others; on the  part of the children, especially of their grandfather and mother; each  young heart was evidently full to overflowing of tenderest sympathy and  love for her.    She had been closely confined to the sick-room for several days, so that  it was a treat to have her with them at breakfast and at family worship,  which followed directly upon the conclusion of the meal.    It surprised them a little that when the short service came to an end, she  did not even then return at once to her sick little ones, but putting on a  garden hat invited her eldest daughter to do likewise and come with her  for a short stroll in the grounds.    \"It will do us both good,\" she said as they stepped from the veranda upon  the broad, gravelled walk, \"the air is so sweet and pure at this early  hour; and you have not been out in it at all, have you?\"    \"No, mamma; and what a treat it is to take it in your dear company,\" Elsie  responded, gathering a lovely, sweet-scented flower and placing it in the  bosom of her mother's dress.    \"Thank you, love,\" Mrs. Travilla said; then went on to speak feelingly of  the beauty and fragrance that surrounded them, and the unnumbered  blessings of their lot in life.    \"Mamma, you seem to have a heart always filled with love and gratitude to  God, and never to be troubled with the least rebellious feeling, or any  doubts or fears for the future,\" remarked Elsie, sighing slightly as she  spoke.    \"Have we any right or reason to indulge repining, doubts, or fears, when  we know that all is ordered for us by One who loves us with an  everlasting and infinite love, and who is all-wise and all-powerful? O my  darling, no! Well may we say with the Psalmist, 'I will fear no evil, for  thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Surely goodness  and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the  house of the Lord forever.' Oh what a blessed assurance! goodness and  mercy while here in this world of trial--all things working together for  our good, that so we may be brought at last safely to our desired  haven--and then to be forever with the Lord!\"    \"Mamma, I have been so anxious and troubled about my little brother and  sister, and about Lester, I needed the lesson you have just given me, and  hope I shall profit by it.\"    \"My dearest child, have faith in God; try to believe with all your heart  that he will never send you or any of his children one unneeded pang. I am  sure you could never think I--your tender mother--would give you the  slightest pain except for your certain good; and what is my love for you  compared to that of your Saviour? who died that you might live!\"    \"Mamma,\" cried the young girl, pausing in her walk, laying her hand on her  mother's arm and looking searchingly into the sweet, compassionate face,  while her own grew deathly pale, \"what is it you are trying to prepare me  for? O mamma!\"    A rustic seat stood close at hand.    \"Let us sit down here for a moment, dear daughter,\" Mrs. Travilla said,  drawing Elsie to it with an arm about her waist. \"You are right, my  child--I have news for you. Oh, not the worst, dearest!\" as Elsie seemed  to gasp for breath. \"Lester lives, but is very ill with typhoid fever.\"    \"Mamma!\" cried Elsie, starting to her feet, \"I must go to him! go at once.  O dearest mother, do not hinder me!\" and she clasped her hands in piteous  entreaty, the big tears rapidly chasing each other down her pale cheeks.    \"If I could go with you,\" faltered the mother, \"or your grandfather; but I  can neither leave nor take my little ones, and he would never consent to  leave me, or his poor old father, who seems just tottering on the verge of  the grave.\"    \"I know! I see! but, O mother, mother! how can I let him die all alone in  a stranger land? Think if it had been you and my father!\"    \"What is your entreaty, daughter?\" Mr. Dinsmore asked, coming up and  laying his hand affectionately upon his grandchild's shoulder.    \"To go to him--to Lester, grandpa. Oh, how can I stay away and leave him  to die alone? to die for lack of the good nursing I could give him,  perhaps to the saving of his life!\"    \"My poor child! my poor dear child!\" he said, caressing her; \"we will see  what can be done in the way of finding a suitable escort, and if that can  be obtained your mother will not, I think, withhold her consent.\"    He had been telling the news to the others, and Edward had followed him,  anxious to express the sympathy for his sister with which his heart was  full.    \"An escort, grandpa?\" he said. \"Would mine be sufficient? Mamma, if you  will permit me, I shall gladly go to Lester, either with or without  Elsie.\"    \"My dear boy!\" was all his mother said, her tones tremulous with emotion,  while his grandfather turned and regarded him with doubtful scrutiny.    \"Oh, thank you, brother!\" cried Elsie. \"Mamma, surely you can trust me to  him! Who loves me better? except yourself--and who would take such tender  care of me?\"    \"Mamma, I would guard her with my life!\" exclaimed Edward earnestly.    \"My dear son, I do not doubt it,\" Mrs. Travilla answered, turning upon her  father a half-inquiring, half-entreating look.    \"If no older or more experienced person can be found.\"    He paused, and Elsie burst out: \"O grandpa, dear grandpa, don't say that!  There is no time to lose! no time to look for other escort!\"    \"That is true, my child; and we will not waste any time. Make your  preparations as rapidly as you can, and if nothing better offers in the  mean while, and your mother consents to Edward's proposition, you shall go  with him--and Ben who travelled all over Europe with your father and  myself--as your protectors.\"    She thanked him fervently through her tears, while her mother said, \"Ah  yes, that is a good thought, papa! Ben shall go with them.\"    \"Better go now and at once select whatever you wish to take with you, and  set some one to packing your trunks,\" he said. \"Edward, do you do  likewise, and I will examine the morning papers for information in regard  to trains and the sailing of the next steamer. Daughter dear,\" to Mrs.  Travilla, \"you need give yourself no concern about any of these matters.\"    \"No, I shall trust everything to you, my best of fathers, and go back at  once to my sick darlings,\" she said, giving him a look of "]]]
