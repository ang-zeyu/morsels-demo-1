Route of the Expedition in Yün-nan            CAMPS AND TRAILS IN CHINA          CHAPTER I      THE OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION    The earliest remains of primitive man probably will be found somewhere in  the vast plateau of Central Asia, north of the Himalaya Mountains. From  this region came the successive invasions that poured into Europe from the  east, to India from the north, and to China from the west; the migration  route to North America led over the Bering Strait and spread fanwise south  and southeast to the farthest extremity of South America. The Central Asian  plateau at the beginning of the Pleistocene was probably less arid than it  is today and there is reason to believe that this general region was not  only the distributing center of man but also of many of the forms of  mammalian life which are now living in other parts of the world. For  instance, our American moose, the wapiti or elk, Rocky Mountain sheep, the  so-called mountain goat, and other animals are probably of Central Asian  origin.    Doubtless there were many contributing causes to the extensive wanderings  of primitive tribes, but as they were primarily hunters, one of the most  important must have been the movements of the game upon which they lived.  Therefore the study of the early human races is, necessarily, closely  connected with, and dependent upon, a knowledge of the Central Asian  mammalian life and its distribution. No systematic palaeontological,  archaeological, or zoölogical study of this region on a large scale has  ever been attempted, and there is no similar area of the inhabited surface  of the earth about which so little is known.    The American Museum of Natural History hopes in the near future to conduct  extensive explorations in this part of the world along general scientific  lines. The country itself and its inhabitants, however, present unusual  obstacles to scientific research. Not only is the region one of vast  intersecting mountain ranges, the greatest of the earth, but the climate is  too cold in winter to permit of continuous work. The people have a natural  dislike for foreigners, and the political events of the last half century  have not tended to decrease their suspicions.    It is possible to overcome such difficulties, but the plans for extensive  research must be carefully prepared. One of the most important steps is the  sending out of preliminary expeditions to gain a general knowledge of the  natives and fauna and of the conditions to be encountered. For the first  reconnoissance, which was intended to be largely a mammalian survey, the  Asiatic Zoölogical Expedition left New York in March, 1916.    Its destination was Yün-nan, a province in southwestern China. This is one  of the least known parts of the Chinese Republic and, because of its  southern latitude and high mountain systems, the climate and faunal range  is very great. It is about equal in size to the state of California and  topographically might be likened to the ocean in a furious gale, for the  greater part of its surface has been thrown into vast mountain waves which  divide and cross one another in hopeless confusion.    Yün-nan is bordered on the north by Tibet and S'suchuan, on the west by  Burma, on the south by Tonking, and on the east by Kwei-chau Province.  Faunistically the entire northwestern part of Yün-nan is essentially  Tibetan, and the plateaus and mountain peaks range from altitudes of 8,000  feet to 20,000 feet above sea level. In the south and west along the  borders of Burma and Tonking, in the low fever-stricken valleys, the  climate is that of the mid-tropics, and the native life, as well as the  fauna and flora, is of a totally different type from that found in the  north.    The natives of Yün-nan are exceptionally interesting. There are about  thirty non-Chinese tribes in the province, some of whom, such as the Shans  and Lolos, represent the aboriginal inhabitants of China, and it is safe to  say that in no similar area of the world is there such a variety of  language and dialects as in this region.    Although the main work of the Expedition was to be conducted in Yün-nan, we  decided to spend a short time in Fukien Province, China, and endeavor to  obtain a specimen of the so-called \"blue tiger\" which has been seen twice  by the Reverend Harry R. Caldwell, a missionary and amateur naturalist, who  has done much hunting in the vicinity of Foochow.    The white members of the first Asiatic Zoölogical Expedition included Mr.  Edmund Heller, my wife (Yvette Borup Andrews) and myself.

Simms, Editor  Jacksonville, Florida  October 27, 1936    SAMUEL SIMEON ANDREWS      For almost 30 years Edward Waters College, an African Methodist  Episcopal School, located on the north side of Kings Road in the western  section of Jacksonville, has employed as watchman, Samuel Simeon Andrews  (affectionately called \"Parson\"), a former slave of A.J. Lane of  Georgia, Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, Ed Tillman of Dallas,  Texas, and John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama.    \"Parson\" was born November 18, 1850 in Macon, Georgia, at a place called  Tatum Square, where slaves were held, housed and sold. \"Speculators\"  (persons who traveled from place to place with slaves for sale) had  housed 84 slaves there--many of whom were pregnant women. Besides  \"Parson,\" two other slave-children, Ed Jones who now lives in Sparta,  Georgia, and George Bailey were born in Tatum Square that night. The  morning after their births, a woman was sent from the nearby A.J. Lane  plantation to take care of the three mothers; this nurse proved to be  \"Parson's\" grandmother. His mother told him afterwards that the meeting  of mother and daughter was very jubilant, but silent and pathetic,  because neither could with safety show her pleasure in finding the  other. At the auction which was held a few days later, his mother,  Rachel, and her two sons, Solomon Augustus and her infant who was later  to be known as \"Parson,\" were purchased by A.J. Lane who had previously  bought \"Parson's\" father, Willis, from a man named Dolphus of Albany,  Georgia; thus were husband and wife re-united. They were taken to Lane's  plantation three miles out of Sparta, Georgia, in Hancock County. Mr.  Lane owned 85 slaves and was known to be very kind and considerate.    \"Parson\" lived on the Lane plantation until he was eight years old, when  he was sold to Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, with whom he  lived for two years; he was then sold to Ed Tillman of Dallas, Texas; he  stayed on the Tillman plantation for about a year and until he was  purchased by John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama--the richest  slave-holder in Union Springs, Alabama; he remained with him until  Emancipation. He recalls that during one of these sales about $800.00  was paid for him.    He describes A.J. Lane as being a kind slave-holder who fed his slaves  well and whipped them but little. All of his other masters, he states,  were nice to children, but lashed and whipped the grown-ups.    Mr. Lane's family was comprised of his wife, Fannie (who also was very  kind to the slaves) five children, Harriett Ann, Jennie, Jeff, Frankie  and Mae Roxie, a brother (whose name he does not recall) who owned a few  slaves but was kind to those that he did own. Although very young during  slavery, \"Parson\" remembers many plantation activities and customs,  among which are the following: That the master's children and those of  the slaves on the plantation played together; the farm crops consisted  of corn, cotton, peas, wheat and oats; that the food for the slaves was  cooked in pots which were hung over a fire; that the iron ovens used by  the slaves had tops for baking; how during the Civil War, wheat, corn  and dried potatoes were parched and used as substitutes for coffee; that  his mother was given a peck of flour every two weeks; that a mixture of  salt and sand was dug from the earthern floor of the smokehouse and  water poured over it to get the salt drippings for seasoning; that most  medicine consisted of boiled roots; when thread and cloth were dyed with  the dye obtained from maple bark; when shoes were made on a wooden last  and soles and uppers fastened together with maple pegs; when the white  preachers preached \"obey your masters\"; that the first buggy that he saw  was owned by his master, A.J. Lane; it had a seat at the rear with rest  which was usually occupied by a man who was called the \"waiter\"; there  was no top to the seat and the \"waiter\" was exposed to the weather. He  recalls when wooden slats and tightened ropes were used for bed springs;  also the patience of \"Aunt Letha\" an old woman slave who took care of  the children in the neighborhood while their parents worked, and how  they enjoyed watching \"Uncle Umphrey\" tan cow and pig hides.    \"Parson\" describes himself as being very frisky as a boy and states that  he did but very little work and got but very few whippings. Twice he ran  away to escape being whipped and hid in asparagus beds in Sparta,  Georgia until nightfall; when he returned the master would not whip him  because he was apprehensive that he might run away again and be stolen  by poorer whites and thus cause trouble. The richer whites, he relates,  were afraid of the poorer whites; if the latter were made angry they  would round up the owners' sheep and turn them loose into their cotton  fields and the sheep would eat the cotton, row by row.    He compares the relationship between the rich and poor whites during  slavery with that of the white and Negro people of today.    With a face full of frowns, \"Parson\" tells of a white man persuading his  mother to let him tie her to show that he was master, promising not to  whip her, and she believed him. When he had placed her in a buck (hands  tied on a stick so that the stick would turn her in any direction) he  whipped her until the blood ran down her back.    With changed expression he told of an incident during the Civil War:  Slaves, he explained had to have passes to go from one plantation to  another and if one were found without a pass the \"patrollers\" would pick  him up, return him to his master and receive pay for their service. The  \"patrollers\" were guards for runaway slaves. One night they came to Aunt  Rhoda's house where a crowd of slaves had gathered and were going to  return them to their masters; Uncle Umphrey the tanner, quickly spaded  up some hot ashes and pitched it on them; all of the slaves escaped  unharmed, while all of the \"patrollers\" were badly injured; no one ever  told on Uncle Umphrey and when Aunt Rhoda was questioned by her master  she stated that she knew nothing about it but told them that the  \"patrollers\" had brought another \"nigger\" with them; her master took it  for granted that she spoke the truth since none of the other Negroes  were hurt. He remembers seeing this but does not remember how he, as a  little boy, was prevented from telling about it.    Asked about his remembrance or knowledge of the slaves' belief in magic  and spells he said: \"I remember this and can just see the dogs running  around now. My mother's brother, \"Uncle Dick\" and \"Uncle July\" swore  they would not work longer for masters; so they ran away and lived in  the woods. In winter they would put cotton seed in the fields to rot for  fertilizer and lay in it for warmth. They would kill hogs and slip the  meat to some slave to cook for food. When their owners looked for them,  \"Bob Amos\" who raised \"nigger hounds\" (hounds raised solely to track  Negro slaves) was summoned and the dogs located them and surrounded them  in their hide-out; one went one way and one the other and escaped in the  swamps; they would run until they came to a fence--each kept some  \"graveyard dust and a few lightwood splinters\" with which they smoked  their feet and jumped the fence and the dogs turned back and could track  no further. Thus, they stayed in the woods until freedom, when they came  out and worked for pay. Now, you know \"Uncle Dick\" just died a few years  ago in Sparta, Georgia.\"    When the Civil War came he remembers hearing one night \"Sherman is  coming.\" It was said that Wheeler's Cavalry of the Confederates"]]]
