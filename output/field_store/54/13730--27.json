You must not suppose that I  mean that if you have a vast hall, or what not, that because you can put  an iron trussed roof over it from wall to wall, that this will make it  into a hall that will raise emotions. You will only get a rail-way  platform or a coal shed. You have got to set your wits to work to see  how it can be properly brought within the pale of aesthetics, and not  only as to the shapes and proportions of the parts, but the dividing of  the whole by supports. It is probable that if you were obliged to vault  a cathedral in stone, with no more money than was necessary, and to have  a clearstory to it, that you could not do it cheaper, and perhaps not  better, than the Gothic architects did it; but to vault such a building  in stone when you could do it much cheaper and better with iron ribs and  concrete is, in my opinion, _dilettante_ art. Groins are not beautiful  things, but, on the contrary, are ugly, and we should wish to obviate  their ugliness if we could; but when they were merely unavoidable  methods of cheap construction, we admire them for the invention and  skill of their architects, and we have to some extent got to love even  their ugliness from old association; though perhaps the ribs at  Westminster Abbey, as seen from the west end, are not offensive.\"    [Illustration: XII.

Until the present stock gives  out, all subscriptions will be dated from the January number, but no  copies will be reserved for this purpose after April 1.           *       *       *       *       *    Response to the call for subscriptions to THE BROCHURE SERIES has been  gratifyingly prompt and generous. The first subscriber was Mr. George B.  Howe, 13 Walnut Street, Boston, the architect of the New Hampshire State  Building at the World's Fair. The first club came from the office of  Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, and was made up as follows: F.B. Wheaton,  R.T. Walker, H.W. Gardner, H.M. Seaver, and J.H. Buttimer. This was  closely followed by a club of eight from the office of Shepley, Rutan &  Coolidge, and another of five from the office of Edwin J. Lewis. The  first response from out of town was a club of five from the office of  Martin & Hall of Providence, R.I. Others \"too numerous to mention\" came  along in quick succession, and the new magazine may now be considered  well launched on its trial trip.           *       *       *       *       *    As the plan of THE BROCHURE SERIES is unique in architectural  journalism, much of the work to be done during its first year will  necessarily be, to a certain extent, experimental. Although the  publishers have for a number of years tried to keep as closely as  possible in touch with the profession throughout the country, the  diversity of tastes to which the new magazine is intended to appeal, and  the practical requirements which it is intended to meet, make even the  simple matter of selecting proper material for publication a difficult  task. Consequently suggestions or criticisms which may lead to its  improvement in any particular will be welcome.           *       *       *       *       *    The design used for the cover of THE BROCHURE SERIES is the result of a  competition in which twenty-three drawings were submitted, and is the  work of Charles Edward Hooper of 250 West 14th Street, New York. The  other competitors, whose designs were all of a high order of excellence,  were: J. Mills Platt, Charles S. King, Francis S. Swales, Edwin S.  Gordon, Fred A. Miller, J.F. Strobel, Jr., George E. Roberts, of  Rochester, N.Y.; G.H. Ingraham, E.P. Dana, F.H. Hutchins, C.E. Patch, of  Boston; J.W. Cinder, W.B. Papin, H.G. Helmerichs, of St. Louis; Louis E.  La Baume, H.H. Braun, of New York City; and Stephen W. Dodge, of  Brooklyn.           *       *       *       *       *    Following out the general plan adopted in the first two issues, which,  contrary to the expectation of the publishers, has proved even so soon  an important feature of the magazine, the illustrations in the next two  numbers will be made up of related subjects. The March number will have  a collection of capitals (Byzantine and Romanesque) from Ravenna and  Palermo, and the April number eight windows from Apulia, of the same  general character as the doorways in the present number.          #Hints to Draughtsmen.#      Architectural students and draughtsmen will find the series of papers  begun in the Feb. 16 number of the _American Architect_, entitled \"Hints  to Art Students on Travelling Abroad,\" filled with valuable suggestions.  The writer of these papers is Mr. J.W. Case, the latest of the Rotch  scholars returned. In the first paper Mr. Case points out the  desirability of preparatory training in academic design, drawing,  modelling, etc., and a knowledge of architectural history and of the  French language in order that the student may make the best use of the  opportunities open to him. He continues with a number of useful hints  upon the best methods to pursue in gaining this preparatory training.    [Illustration: XIII. The Principal Doorway to the Basilica at Altamura,  Italy.]    The second paper is devoted to practical suggestions of such immediate  value that it is worth while to quote a portion of them in full:--    \"To get the most good out of a trip, one should be prepared to work in  all sorts of ways,--to make measured drawings, sketches, color notes,  squeezes, rubbings, sections with the lead; to study from plates and  make T-square sketches, scratch-book notes, photographic notes, and  memory sketches.    \"Travelling students are apt to place too much value on perspective  sketches. Good ones make a nice showing on returning home, but they are  of little value to any one but the maker. It is usually possible to find  photographs of the things over which one spends so many hours making  pretty sketches. But sketches do have a certain value in teaching  rendering, and encourage the habit of observing closely the effect of  light and shade.    \"Beautiful pencil sketches may be made on English metallic paper by  simply drawing the shadows on carving in full sunshine: colored papers  are very useful to gain quick effects with the use of Chinese white. A  pad of Whatman water-color paper, imperial size, is much better to work  on than a small cramped little book; and it may be used as a  drawing-board, thus diminishing the number of articles to carry. The  T-square will run along the edge of the block well enough for sketches,  but it is better to carry a straight-edge to clamp on the edge of the  block with thumb-screws for the square to work on. Have a canvas bag  made with a flap in which to carry the block. It will keep out the dirt  and dust of travel and be of great service.    \"Sometimes valuable color notes are to be had in crowded buildings where  it is not convenient to sit down and make a large study. For such cases  a small pocket water-color block will be very useful. There is a small  vest-pocket water-color box carrying six colors, which may be set over  the thumb, a water-bottle attached, and with it one can stand unobserved  in a corner and get color notes which otherwise must be passed by. In  studying fresco painting, tempera is very useful. It is mixed up with  water and applied to paper, but may be worked over in the manner of  oils,--a great advantage in making studies.    \"The _chambre eclaire_ is invaluable as an aid to drawing, in blocking  out water-colors. It will enable one to make a drawing in an hour which  otherwise would require all day. It is an instrument little known  outside of Paris, but is much in use there among architects. It consists  of a prism mounted on a telescoping leg which may be fastened to the  drawing-board. The eye looks through the prism and sees the building  reflected on the paper; all that remains to do is to trace this outline.  It does not teach one to draw, but it does save time, and produces  better drawings than can be made without it. The best place to buy them  is of Cevalier, on the Seine, near the Pont Netif, Paris. Only those  with the best prisms are of any use: such a one, with two adjustments  only, can be had for sixty-five francs. The table which is necessary for  its use costs fifteen francs additional; that is, a total cost of  sixteen dollars. In buying a table, be sure and get one with sliding  legs which can be taken off the head and packed flat.    \"One of the very best ways to study, and one which has very direct  tangible results, is by the aid of printed plates. Take such a book as  Letarouilly's _Edifices de Rome Moderne_. Go to the buildings themselves  and compare the drawing with the building; see what drawings on paper  really mean when executed; mark"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],[0,"A Grammar of the English Tongue (#2)"],[1,"body; bowl, a wooden vessel.    Ou is sometimes pronounced like o soft, as court; sometimes like o short,  as cough; sometimes like u close, as could; or u open, as rough, tough,  which use only can teach.        Ou is frequently used in the last syllable of words which in Latin end      in or and are made English, as honour, labour, favour, from honor,      labor, favor.        Some late innovators have ejected the u, without considering that the      last syllable gives the sound neither of or nor ur, but a sound between      them, if not compounded of both; besides that they are probably derived      to us from the French nouns in eur, as honeur, faveur.    U.    U is long in [=u]se, conf[=u]sion; or short, as [)u]s, conc[)u]ssion.    It coalesces with a, e, i, o; but has rather in these combinations the  force of the w consonant, as quaff, quest, quit, quite, languish; sometimes  in ui the i loses its sound, as in juice. It is sometimes mute before a, e,  i, y, as guard, guest, guise, buy.        U is followed by e in virtue, but the e has no sound.        Ue is sometimes mute at the end of a word, in imitation of the French,      as prorogue, synagogue, plague, vague, harangue.    Y.    Y is a vowel, which, as Quintilian observes of one of the Roman letters, we  might want without inconvenience, but that we have it. It supplies the  place of i at the end of words, as thy, before an i, as dying; and is  commonly retained in derivative words where it was part of a diphthong, in  the primitive; as, destroy, destroyer; betray, betrayed, betrayer; pray,  prayer; say, sayer; day, days.        Y being the Saxon vowel y, which was commonly used where i is now put,      occurs very frequently in all old books.    GENERAL RULES.    A vowel in the beginning or middle syllable, before two consonants, is  commonly short, as [)o]pp[)o]rtunity.    In monosyllables a single vowel before a single consonant is short; as  stag, frog.        Many is pronounced as if it were written manny.           *       *       *       *       *    OF CONSONANTS.    B.    B has one unvaried sound, such as it obtains in other languages.    It is mute in debt, debtor, subtle, doubt, lamb, limb, dumb, thumb, climb,  comb, womb.        It is used before l and r, as black, brown.    C.    C has before e and i the sound of s; as sincerely, centrick, century,  circular, cistern, city, siccity: before a, o, and u, it sounds like k, as  calm, concavity, copper, incorporate, curiosity, concupiscence.        C might be omitted in the language without loss, since one of its      sounds might be supplied by, s, and the other by k, but that it      preserves to the eye the etymology of words, as face from facies,      captive from captivus.    Ch has a sound which is analyzed into tsh, as church, chin, crutch. It is  the same sound which the Italians give to the c simple before i and e, as  citta, cerro.    Ch is sounded like k in words derived from the Greek, as chymist, scheme,  choler. Arch is commonly sounded ark before a vowel, as archangel, and with  the English sound of ch before a consonant, as archbishop.        Ch, in some French words not yet assimilated, sounds like sh, as      machine, chaise.        C, according to English orthography, never ends a word; therefore we      write stick, block, which were originally, sticke, blocke. In such      words c is now mute.        It is used before l and r, as clock, cross.    D.    Is uniform in its sound, as death, diligent.        It is used before r, as draw, dross; and w as dwell.    F.    F, though having a name beginning with a vowel, is numbered by the  grammarians among the semivowels, yet has this quality of a mute, that it  is commodiously sounded before a liquid, as flask, fry, freckle. It has an  unvariable sound, except that of is sometimes spoken nearly as ov.    G.    G has two sounds; one hard, as in gay, go, gun; the other soft, as in gem,  giant.    At the end of a word it is always hard, as ring, snug, song, frog.    Before e and i the sound is uncertain.    G before e is soft, as gem, generation, except in gear, geld, geese, get,  gewgaw, and derivatives from words ending in g, as singing, stronger, and  generally before er at the ends of words, as finger.    G is mute before n, as gnash, sign, foreign.    G before i is hard, as give, except in giant, gigantick, gibbet, gibe,  giblets, Giles, gill, gilliflower, gin, ginger, gingle, to which may be  added Egypt and gypsy.    Gh in the beginning of a word has the sound of the hard g, as ghostly; in  the middle, and sometimes at the end, it is quite silent, as though, right,  sought, spoken tho', rite, soute.    It has often at the end the sound of f, as laugh; whence laughter retains  the same sound in the middle; cough, trough, sough, tough, enough, slough.        It is not to be doubted, but that in the original pronunciation gh has      the force of a consonant deeply guttural, which is still continued      among the Scotch.        G is used before h, l, and r.    H.    H is a note of aspiration, and shows that the following vowel must be  pronounced with a strong emission of breath, as hat, horse.    It seldom begins any but the first syllable, in which it is always sounded  with a full breath, except in heir, herb, hostler, honour, humble, honest,  humour and their derivatives.        It sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded, as      blockhead; or derived from the Latin, as comprehend.    J.    J consonant sounds uniformly like the soft g, and is therefore a letter  useless, except in etymology, as ejaculation, jester, jocund, juice.    K.    K has the sound of hard c, and is used before e and i, where, according to  English analogy, c would be soft, as kept, king, skirt, skeptick, for so it  should be written, not sceptick, because sc is sounded like s, as in scene.        It is used before n, as knell, knot, but totally loses its sound in      modern pronunciation.    K is never doubled; but c is used before it to shorten the vowel by a  double consonant, as cockle, pickle.    L.    L has in English the same liquid sound as in other languages.        The custom is to double the l at the end of monosyllables, as kill,      will, full. These words were originally written kille, wille, fulle;      and when the e first grew silent, and was afterward omitted, the ll was      retained, to give force, according to the analogy of our language, to      the foregoing vowel.    L, is sometimes mute, as in calf, half, halves, calves, could, would,  should, psalm, talk, salmon, falcon.        The Saxons, who delighted in guttural sounds, sometimes aspirated the l      at the beginning of words, as hlaf, a loaf, or bread; hlaford, a lord;      but this pronunciation is now disused.    Le at the end of words is pronounced like a weak el, in which the e is  almost mute, as table, shuttle.    M.    M has always the same sound, as murmur, monumental.    N.    N has always, the same sound, as noble, manners.    N is sometimes mute after m, as damn, condemn, hymn.    P.    P has always the same sound which the Welsh and Germans confound with b.    P is sometimes mute, as in psalm, and between m and t, as tempt.    Ph is used for f in words derived from the Greek, as philosopher,  philanthropy, Philip.    Q.    Q, as in other languages, is always followed by u, and has a sound which  our Saxon ancestors well expressed by cw, as quadrant, queen, equestrian,  quilt, inquiry, quire, quotidian. Qu is never followed by u.    Qu is sometimes sounded, in words derived from the French, like k, as  conquer, liquor, risque, chequer.    R.    R has the same rough snarling sound as in the other tongues.        The Saxons used often to put h before it, as before l at the beginning      of words.        Rh is used in words derived from the Greek, as myrrh, myrrhine,      catarrhous, rheum, rheumatick, rhyme.    Re, at the end of some words derived from the Latin or French, is  pronounced like a weak er, as theatre, sepulchre.    S.    S has a hissing sound, as sibilation, sister.        A single s seldom ends any word, except in the third person of verbs,      as loves, grows; and the plurals of nouns, as trees, bushes,      distresses; the pronouns this, his, ours, yours, us; the adverb thus;      and words derived from Latin, as rebus, surplus; the close being always      either in se, as house, horse, or in ss, as grass, dress, bliss, less,      anciently grasse, dresse.    S, single at the end of words, has a grosser sound, like that of z, as  trees, eyes, except this, thus, us, rebus, surplus.    It sounds like z before ion, if a vowel goes before it, as intrusion; and  like s, if it follows a consonant, as conversion.    It sounds like z before e mute, as refuse, and before y final, as rosy; and  in those words, bosom, desire, wisdom, prison, prisoner, present, present,  damsel, casement.        It is the peculiar quality of s, that it may be sounded before all      consonants, except x and z, in which s is comprised, x being only ks,      and z a hard or gross s. This s is therefore termed by grammarians suae      potestatis litera; the reason of which the learned Dr. Clarke      erroneously supposed to be, that in some words it might be doubled at      pleasure. Thus we find in several languages.    [Greek: Sbennymi], scatter, sdegno, sdrucciolo, sfavellare, [Greek:  sphinx], sgombrare, sgranare, shake, slumber, smell, snipe, space,  splendour, spring, squeeze, shrew, step, strength, stramen, stripe,  sventura, swell.    S is mute in isle, island, demesne, viscount.    T.    T has its customary sound; as take, temptation.    Ti before a vowel has the sound of si as salvation, except an s goes  before, as question; excepting likewise derivatives from words ending in  ty, as mighty, mightier.    Th has two sounds; the one soft, as thus, whether; the other hard, as  thing, think. The sound is soft in these words,"]]]
