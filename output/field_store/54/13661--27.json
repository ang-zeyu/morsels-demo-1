Some additions, but not many, have been made  to the present edition from these sources. The recently-published Diary  of Gideon Welles, one of the most valuable commentaries on the Civil War  period now available, has provided some material of exceptional interest  concerning Lincoln's relations with the members of his Cabinet.    In re-writing the present work, it has been compressed into about  two-thirds of its former compass, to render it more popular both in form  and in price, and to give it in some places a greater measure of  coherency and continuity as an outline narrative of the Civil War. But  its chief appeal to the interest of its readers will remain  substantially what it was in the beginning, as set forth in its title,  \"The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln, by Those Who Knew Him.\"    F.F.B.  SANTA BARBARA, CAL., _April, 1913._          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION    This book aims to give a view, clearer and more complete than has been  given before, of the personality of Abraham Lincoln. A life so full of  incident and a character so many-sided as his can be understood only  with the lapse of time. A sense of the exhaustless interest of that life  and character, and the inadequacy of the ordinarily constructed  biography to portray his many-sidedness, suggested the preparation of a  work upon the novel plan here represented. Begun several years ago, the  undertaking proved of such magnitude that its completion has been  delayed beyond the anticipated time. The extensive correspondence, the  exploration of available sources of information in the books, pamphlets,  magazines, and newspapers of a quarter of a century, and in the scraps  and papers of historical collections, became an almost interminable  task. The examination and sifting of this mass of material, its  verification amidst often conflicting testimony, and its final molding  into shape, involved time and labor that can be estimated only by those  who have had similar experience.    To the many who have kindly furnished original contributions, to others  who have aided the work by valuable suggestions and information, to  earlier biographies of Lincoln--those of Raymond, Holland, Barrett,  Lamon, Carpenter, and (the best and latest of all) that of Hon. I.N.  Arnold--hearty acknowledgment is made. Much that was offered could not  be used. In the choice of material, from whatever source, the purpose  has been to avoid mere opinions and eulogies of Lincoln and to give  abundantly those actual experiences, incidents, anecdotes, and  reminiscences which reveal the phases of his unique and striking  personality.    It scarcely need be pointed out that this work does not attempt to give  a connected history of the Civil War, but only to sketch briefly those  episodes with which Lincoln is personally identified and of which some  knowledge is essential to an understanding of his acts and character.  Others are brought into prominence only as they are associated with the  chief actor in the great drama. Many of them are disappearing,--fading  into the smoky and lurid background. But that colossal central figure,  playing one of the grandest roles ever set upon the stage of human life,  becomes more impressive as the scenes recede.    F.F.B.

In Chaucer's time two or three negatives were used to  strengthen a negation; as, \"Ther _nas no_ man _nowher_ so vertuous\"  (There never was no man nowhere so virtuous). And Shakespeare used  good English when he said _more elder_ (\"Merchant of Venice\") and  _most unkindest_ (\"Julius Caesar\"); but this is bad English now.    If, however, we have tabulated the inflections of the language, and  stated what syntax is the most used in certain troublesome places,  there is still much for the grammarian to do.    [Sidenote: _A broader view_.]    Surely our noble language, with its enormous vocabulary, its peculiar  and abundant idioms, its numerous periphrastic forms to express every  possible shade of meaning, is worthy of serious study, apart from the  mere memorizing of inflections and formulation of rules.    [Sidenote: _Mental training. An aesthetic benefit._]    Grammar is eminently a means of mental training; and while it will  train the student in subtle and acute reasoning, it will at the same  time, if rightly presented, lay the foundation of a keen observation  and a correct literary taste. The continued contact with the highest  thoughts of the best minds will create a thirst for the \"well of  English undefiled.\"    [Sidenote: _What grammar is_.]    Coming back, then, from the question, _What ground should grammar  cover?_ we come to answer the question, _What should grammar teach?_  and we give as an answer the definition,--    _English grammar is the science which treats of the nature of words,  their forms, and their uses and relations in the sentence_.    [Sidenote: _The work it will cover._]    This will take in the usual divisions, \"The Parts of Speech\" (with  their inflections), \"Analysis,\" and \"Syntax.\" It will also require a  discussion of any points that will clear up difficulties, assist the  classification of kindred expressions, or draw the attention of the  student to everyday idioms and phrases, and thus incite his  observation.    [Sidenote: _Authority as a basis_.]    A few words here as to the _authority_ upon which grammar rests.    [Sidenote: _Literary English_.]    The statements given will be substantiated by quotations from the  leading or \"standard\" literature of modern times; that is, from the  eighteenth century on. This _literary English_ is considered the  foundation on which grammar must rest.    [Sidenote: _Spoken English_.]    Here and there also will be quoted words and phrases from _spoken_ or  _colloquial English_, by which is meant the free, unstudied  expressions of ordinary conversation and communication among  intelligent people.    These quotations will often throw light on obscure constructions,  since they preserve turns of expressions that have long since perished  from the literary or standard English.    [Sidenote: _Vulgar English_.]    Occasionally, too, reference will be made to _vulgar English,_--the  speech of the uneducated and ignorant,--which will serve to illustrate  points of syntax once correct, or standard, but now undoubtedly bad  grammar.    The following pages will cover, then, three divisions:--    Part I. The Parts of Speech, and Inflections.    Part II. Analysis of Sentences.    Part III. The Uses of Words, or Syntax.            PART I.    _THE PARTS OF SPEECH_.          NOUNS.      1. In the more simple _state_ of the _Arabs_, the _nation_ is free,  because each of her _sons_ disdains a base _submission_ to the _will_  of a _master_.--GIBBON.    [Sidenote: _Name words_]    By examining this sentence we notice several words used as names. The  plainest name is _Arabs_, which belongs to a people; but, besides this  one, the words _sons_ and _master_ name objects, and may belong to any  of those objects. The words _state, submission,_ and _will_ are  evidently names of a different kind, as they stand for ideas, not  objects; and the word _nation_ stands for a whole group.    When the meaning of each of these words has once been understood, the  word naming it will always call up the thing or idea itself. Such  words are called nouns.      [Sidenote: _Definition_.]    2. A noun is a name word, representing directly to the mind an  object, substance, or idea.      [Sidenote: _Classes of nouns_.]    3. Nouns are classified as follows:--    (1) Proper.    (2) Common.     (a) CLASS NAMES:  i.  Individual.                                    ii. Collective.                  (b) MATERIAL.    (3) Abstract.   (a) ATTRIBUTE.                  (b) VERBAL      [Sidenote: _Names for special objects._]    4. A proper noun is a name applied to a particular object, whether  person, place, or thing.    It specializes or limits the thing to which it is applied, reducing it  to a narrow application. Thus, _city_ is a word applied to any one of  its kind; but _Chicago_ names one city, and fixes the attention upon  that particular city. _King_ may be applied to any ruler of a kingdom,  but _Alfred the Great_ is the name of one king only.    The word _proper_ is from a Latin word meaning _limited, belonging to  one_. This does not imply, however, that a proper name can be applied  to only one object, but that each time such a name is applied it is  fixed or proper to that object. Even if there are several Bostons or  Manchesters, the name of each is an individual or proper name.      [Sidenote: _Name for any individual of a class._]    5. A common noun is a name possessed by _any_ one of a class of  persons, animals, or things.    _Common_, as here used, is from a Latin word which means _general,  possessed by all_.    For instance, _road_ is a word that names _any_ highway outside of  cities; _wagon_ is a term that names _any_ vehicle of a certain kind  used for hauling: the words are of the widest application. We may say,  _the man here_, or _the man in front of you_, but the word _man_ is  here hedged in by other words or word groups: the name itself is of  general application.    [Sidenote: _Name for a group or collection of objects._]    Besides considering persons, animals, and things separately, we may  think of them in groups, and appropriate names to the groups.    Thus, men in groups may be called a _crowd_, or a _mob_, a  _committee_, or a _council_, or a _congress_, etc.    These are called COLLECTIVE NOUNS. They properly belong under common  nouns, because each group is considered as a unit, and the name  applied to it belongs to any group of its class.      [Sidenote: _Names for things thought of in mass._]    6. The definition given for common nouns applies more strictly to  class nouns. It may, however, be correctly used for another group of  nouns detailed below; for they are common nouns in the sense that the  names apply to _every particle of similar substance_, instead of to  each individual or separate object.    They are called MATERIAL NOUNS. Such are _glass_, _iron_, _clay_,  _frost_, _rain_, _snow_, _wheat_, _wine_, _tea_, _sugar_, etc.    They may be placed in groups as follows:--    (1) The metals: _iron_, _gold_, _platinum_, etc.    (2) Products spoken of in bulk: _tea_, _sugar_, _rice_, _wheat_, etc.    (3) Geological bodies: _mud_, _sand_, _granite_, _rock_, _stone_, etc.    (4) Natural phenomena: _rain_, _dew_, _cloud_, _frost_, _mist_, etc.    (5) Various manufactures: _cloth_ (and the different kinds of cloth),  _potash_, _soap_, _rubber_, _paint_, _celluloid_, etc.    7. NOTE.--There are some nouns, such as _sun_, _moon_, _earth_,  which seem to be the names of particular individual objects, but which  are not called proper names.    [Sidenote: _Words naturally of limited application not proper._]    The reason is, that in proper names the intention is _to exclude_ all  other individuals of the same class, and fasten a special name to the  object considered, as in calling a city _Cincinnati_; but in the words  _sun_, _earth_, etc., there is no such intention. If several bodies  like the center of our solar system are known, they also are called  _suns_ by a natural extension of the term: so with the words _earth_,  _world_, etc. They remain common class names.      [Sidenote: _Names of ideas, not things._]    8. Abstract nouns are names of qualities, conditions, or actions,  considered abstractly, or apart from their natural connection.    When we speak of a _wise man_, we recognize in him an attribute or  quality. If we wish to think simply of that quality without describing  the person, we speak of the _wisdom_ of the man. The quality is still  there as much as before, but it is taken merely as a name. So  _poverty_ would express the condition of a poor person; _proof_ means  the act of proving, or that which shows a thing has been proved; and  so on.    Again, we may say, \"_Painting_ is a fine art,\" \"_Learning_ is hard to  acquire,\" \"a man of _understanding_.\"      9. There are two chief divisions of abstract nouns:--    (1) ATTRIBUTE NOUNS, expressing attributes or qualities.    (2) VERBAL NOUNS, expressing state, condition, or action.      [Sidenote: _Attribute abstract nouns._]    10. The ATTRIBUTE ABSTRACT NOUNS are derived from adjectives and  from common nouns. Thus, (1) _prudence_ from _prudent_, _height_ from  _high_, _redness_ from _red_, _stupidity_ from _stupid_, etc.; (2)  _peerage_ from _peer_, _childhood_ from _child_, _mastery_ from  _master_, _kingship_ from _king_, etc.        [Sidenote: _Verbal abstract nouns._]    II. The VERBAL ABSTRACT NOUNS Originate in verbs, as their name  implies. They may be--    (1) Of the same form as the simple verb. The verb, by altering its  function, is used as a noun; as in the expressions, \"a long _run_\" \"a  bold _move_,\" \"a brisk _walk_.\"    (2) Derived from verbs by changing the ending or adding a suffix:  _motion_ from _move_, _speech_ from _speak_, _theft_ from _thieve_,  _action_ from _act_, _service_ from _serve_.    [Sidenote: _Caution._]    (3) Derived from verbs by adding _-ing_ to the simple verb. It must be  remembered that these"]]]
