[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#2)"],[1,"so much by way of preface, I beg my readers to fancy  themselves wafted away to the shores of the Bay of Yedo--a fair,  smiling landscape: gentle slopes, crested by a dark fringe of pines  and firs, lead down to the sea; the quaint eaves of many a temple and  holy shrine peep out here and there from the groves; the bay itself is  studded with picturesque fisher-craft, the torches of which shine by  night like glow-worms among the outlying forts; far away to the west  loom the goblin-haunted heights of Oyama, and beyond the twin hills of  the Hakone Pass--Fuji-Yama, the Peerless Mountain, solitary and grand,  stands in the centre of the plain, from which it sprang vomiting  flames twenty-one centuries ago.[1] For a hundred and sixty years the  huge mountain has been at peace, but the frequent earthquakes still  tell of hidden fires, and none can say when the red-hot stones and  ashes may once more fall like rain over five provinces.    In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in Takanawa, a suburb of  Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned  throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which  contains the graves of the Forty-seven. Ronins,[2] famous in Japanese  history, heroes of Japanese drama, the tale of whose deeds I am about  to transcribe.    On the left-hand side of the main court of the temple is a chapel, in  which, surmounted by a gilt figure of Kwanyin, the goddess of mercy,  are enshrined the images of the forty-seven men, and of the master  whom they loved so well. The statues are carved in wood, the faces  coloured, and the dresses richly lacquered; as works of art they have  great merit--the action of the heroes, each armed with his favourite  weapon, being wonderfully life-like and spirited. Some are venerable  men, with thin, grey hair (one is seventy-seven years old); others are  mere boys of sixteen. Close by the chapel, at the side of a path  leading up the hill, is a little well of pure water, fenced in and  adorned with a tiny fernery, over which is an inscription, setting  forth that \"This is the well in which the head was washed; you must  not wash your hands or your feet here.\" A little further on is a  stall, at which a poor old man earns a pittance by selling books,  pictures, and medals, commemorating the loyalty of the Forty-seven;  and higher up yet, shaded by a grove of stately trees, is a neat  inclosure, kept up, as a signboard announces, by voluntary  contributions, round which are ranged forty-eight little tombstones,  each decked with evergreens, each with its tribute of water and  incense for the comfort of the departed spirit. There were forty-seven  Ronins; there are forty-eight tombstones, and the story of the  forty-eighth is truly characteristic of Japanese ideas of honour.  Almost touching the rail of the graveyard is a more imposing monument  under which lies buried the lord, whose death his followers piously  avenged.    [Footnote 1: According to Japanese tradition, in the fifth year of the  Emperor Korei (286 B.C.), the earth opened in the province of Omi,  near Kioto, and Lake Biwa, sixty miles long by about eighteen broad,  was formed in the shape of a _Biwa_, or four-stringed lute, from which  it takes its name. At the same time, to compensate for the depression  of the earth, but at a distance of over three hundred miles from the  lake, rose Fuji-Yama, the last eruption of which was in the year 1707.  The last great earthquake at Yedo took place about fifteen years ago.  Twenty thousand souls are said to have perished in it, and the dead  were carried away and buried by cartloads; many persons, trying to  escape from their falling and burning houses, were caught in great  clefts, which yawned suddenly in the earth, and as suddenly closed  upon the victims, crushing them to death. For several days heavy  shocks continued to be felt, and the people camped out, not daring to  return to such houses as had been spared, nor to build up those which  lay in ruins.]    [Footnote 2: The word _Ronin_ means, literally, a \"wave-man\"; one who  is tossed about hither and thither, as a wave of the sea. It is used  to designate persons of gentle blood, entitled to bear arms, who,  having become separated from their feudal lords by their own act, or  by dismissal, or by fate, wander about the country in the capacity of  somewhat disreputable knights-errant, without ostensible means of  living, in some cases offering themselves for hire to new masters, in  others supporting themselves by pillage; or who, falling a grade in  the social scale, go into trade, and become simple wardsmen. Sometimes  it happens that for political reasons a man will become Ronin, in  order that his lord may not be implicated in some deed of blood in  which he is about to engage. Sometimes, also, men become Ronins, and  leave their native place for a while, until some scrape in which they  have become entangled shall have blown over; after which they return  to their former allegiance. Nowadays it is not unusual for men to  become Ronins for a time, and engage themselves in the service of  foreigners at the open ports, even in menial capacities, in the hope  that they may pick up something of the language and lore of Western  folks. I know instances of men of considerable position who have  adopted this course in their zeal for education.]    And now for the story.    At the beginning of the eighteenth century there lived a daimio,  called Asano Takumi no Kami, the Lord of the castle of Ako, in the  province of Harima. Now it happened that an Imperial ambassador from  the Court of the Mikado having been sent to the Shogun[3] at Yedo,  Takumi no Kami and another noble called Kamei Sama were appointed to  receive and feast the envoy; and a high official, named Kira Kotsuke  no Suke, was named to teach them the proper ceremonies to be observed  upon the occasion. The two nobles were accordingly forced to go daily  to the castle to listen to the instructions of Kotsuke no Suke. But  this Kotsuke no Suke was a man greedy of money; and as he deemed that  the presents which the two daimios, according to time-honoured custom,  had brought him in return for his instruction were mean and unworthy,  he conceived a great hatred against them, and took no pains in  teaching them, but on the contrary rather sought to make  laughing-stocks of them. Takumi no Kami, restrained by a stern sense  of duty, bore his insults with patience; but Kamei Sama, who had less  control over his temper, was violently incensed, and determined to  kill Kotsuke no Suke.    [Footnote 3: The full title of the Tycoon was Sei-i-tai-Shogun,  \"Barbarian-repressing Commander-in-chief.\" The style Tai Kun, Great  Prince, was borrowed, in order to convey the idea of sovereignty to  foreigners, at the time of the conclusion of the Treaties. The envoys  sent by the Mikado from Kioto to communicate to the Shogun the will of  his sovereign were received with Imperial honours, and the duty of  entertaining them was confided to nobles of rank. The title  Sei-i-tai-Shogun was first borne by Minamoto no Yoritomo, in the  seventh month of the year A.D. 1192.]    [Illustration: THE WELL IN WHICH THE HEAD WAS WASHED.]    One night when his duties at the castle were ended, Kamei Sama  returned to his own palace, and having summoned his councillors[4] to  a secret conference, said to them: \"Kotsuke no Suke has insulted  Takumi no Kami and myself during our service in attendance on the  Imperial envoy. This is against all decency, and I was minded to kill  him on the spot; but I bethought me that if I did such a deed within  the precincts of the castle, not only would my own life be forfeit,  but my family and vassals would be ruined: so I stayed my hand. Still  the life of such a wretch is a sorrow to the people, and to-morrow  when I go to Court I will slay him: my mind is made up, and I will  listen to no remonstrance.\" And as he spoke his face became livid with  rage.    [Footnote 4: Councillor, lit. \"elder.\" The councillors of daimios were  of two classes: the _Karo_, or \"elder,\" an hereditary office, held by  cadets of the Prince's family, and the _Yonin_, or \"man of business,\"  who was selected on account of his merits. These \"councillors\" play no  mean part in Japanese history.]    Now one of Kamei Sama's councillors was a man of great judgment, and  when he saw from his lord's manner that remonstrance would be useless,  he said: \"Your lordship's words are law; your servant will make all  preparations accordingly; and to-morrow, when your lordship goes to  Court, if this Kotsuke no Suke should again be insolent, let him die  the death.\" And his lord was pleased at this speech, and waited with  impatience for the day to break, that he might return to Court and  kill his enemy.    But the councillor went home, and was sorely troubled, and thought  anxiously about what his prince had said. And as he reflected, it  occurred to him that since Kotsuke no Suke had the reputation of being  a miser he would certainly be open to a bribe, and that it was better  to pay any sum, no matter how great, than that his lord and his house  should be ruined. So he collected all the money he could, and, giving  it to his servants to carry, rode off in the night to Kotsuke no  Suke's palace, and said to his retainers: \"My master, who is now in  attendance upon the Imperial envoy, owes much thanks to my Lord  Kotsuke no Suke, who has been at so great pains to teach him the  proper ceremonies to be observed during the reception of the Imperial  envoy. This is but a shabby present which he has sent by me, but he  hopes that his lordship will condescend to accept it, and commends  himself to his lordship's favour.\" And, with these words, he produced  a thousand ounces of silver for Kotsuke no Suke, and a hundred ounces  to be distributed among his retainers.    When the latter saw the money their eyes sparkled with pleasure, and  they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#2)"],[1,"convinced them of their superstition.    Imagine an open space near the grand Temple of Diana, with fine  buildings around. Slightly raised above the crowd, the Apostle,  preaching with great power and persuasion concerning superstition, holds  in thrall the assembled multitude. On the outskirts of the crowd are  numerous bonfires, upon which Jew and Gentile are throwing into  the flames bundle upon bundle of scrolls, while an Asiarch with his  peace-officers looks on with the conventional stolidity of policemen  in all ages and all nations. It must have been an impressive scene, and  many a worse subject has been chosen for the walls of the Royal Academy.    Books in those early times, whether orthodox or heterodox, appear to  have had a precarious existence. The heathens at each fresh outbreak of  persecution burnt all the Christian writings they could find, and the  Christians, when they got the upper hand, retaliated with interest upon  the pagan literature. The Mohammedan reason for destroying books--\"If  they contain what is in the Koran they are superfluous, and if they  contain anything opposed to it they are immoral,\" seems, indeed,  _mutatis mutandis_, to have been the general rule for all such  devastators.    The Invention of Printing made the entire destruction of any author's  works much more difficult, so quickly and so extensively did books  spread through all lands. On the other hand, as books multiplied, so did  destruction go hand in hand with production, and soon were printed books  doomed to suffer in the same penal fires, that up to then had been fed  on MSS. only.    At Cremona, in 1569, 12,000 books printed in Hebrew were publicly burnt  as heretical, simply on account of their language; and Cardinal Ximenes,  at the capture of Granada, treated 5,000 copies of the Koran in the same  way.    At the time of the Reformation in England a great destruction of books  took place. The antiquarian Bale, writing in 1587, thus speaks of the  shameful fate of the Monastic libraries:--      \"A greate nombre of them whyche purchased those superstycyouse mansyons  (_Monasteries_) reserved of those librarye bookes some to serve their  jakes, some to scoure theyr candelstyckes, and some to rubbe theyr  bootes. Some they solde to the grossers and sope sellers, and some they  sent over see to yeS booke bynders, not in small nombre, but at tymes  whole shyppes full, to yeS, wonderynge of foren nacyons. Yea yeS.  Universytees of thys realme are not alle clere in thys detestable fact.  But cursed is that bellye whyche seketh to be fedde with suche ungodlye  gaynes, and so depelye shameth hys natural conterye. I knowe a merchant  manne, whych shall at thys tyme be namelesse, that boughte yeS contentes  of two noble lybraryes for forty shyllynges pryce: a shame it is to be  spoken. Thys stuffe hathe heoccupyed in yeS stede of greye paper, by  yeS, space of more than these ten yeares, and yet he bathe store ynoughe  for as manye years to come. A prodygyous example is thys, and to be  abhorred of all men whyche love theyr nacyon as they shoulde do. The  monkes kepte them undre dust, yeS, ydle-headed prestes regarded them  not, theyr latter owners have most shamefully abused them, and yeS  covetouse merchantes have solde them away into foren nacyons for  moneye.\"      How the imagination recoils at the idea of Caxton's translation of the  Metamorphoses of Ovid, or perhaps his \"Lyf of therle of Oxenforde,\"  together with many another book from our first presses, not a fragment  of which do we now possess, being used for baking \"pyes.\"    At the Great Fire of London in 1666, the number of books burnt was  enormous. Not only in private houses and Corporate and Church libraries  were priceless collections reduced to cinders, but an immense stock  of books removed from Paternoster Row by the Stationers for safety was  burnt to ashes in the vaults of St. Paul's Cathedral.    Coming nearer to our own day, how thankful we ought to be for the  preservation of the Cotton Library. Great was the consternation in the  literary world of 1731 when they heard of the fire at Ashburnham House,  Westminster, where, at that time, the Cotton MSS. were deposited. By  great exertions the fire was conquered, but not before many MSS. had  been quite destroyed and many others injured. Much skill was shown  in the partial restoration of these books, charred almost beyond  recognition; they were carefully separated leaf by leaf, soaked in a  chemical solution, and then pressed flat between sheets of transparent  paper. A curious heap of scorched leaves, previous to any treatment, and  looking like a monster wasps' nest, may be seen in a glass case in the  MS. department of the British Museum, showing the condition to which  many other volumes had been reduced.    Just a hundred years ago the mob, in the \"Birmingham Riots,\" burnt the  valuable library of Dr. Priestley, and in the \"Gordon Riots\" were burnt  the literary and other collections of Lord Mansfield, the celebrated  judge, he who had the courage first to decide that the Slave who reached  the English shore was thenceforward a free man. The loss of the latter  library drew from the poet Cowper two short and weak poems. The poet  first deplores the destruction of the valuable printed books, and then  the irretrievable loss to history by the burning of his Lordship's many  personal manuscripts and contemporary documents.          \"Their pages mangled, burnt and torn,            The loss was his alone;        But ages yet to come shall mourn            The burning of his own.\"      The second poem commences with the following doggerel:--          \"When Wit and Genius meet their doom            In all-devouring Flame,        They tell us of the Fate of Rome            And bid us fear the same.\"      The much finer and more extensive library of Dr. Priestley was left  unnoticed and unlamented by the orthodox poet, who probably felt a  complacent satisfaction at the destruction of heterodox books, the owner  being an Unitarian Minister.    The magnificent library of Strasbourg was burnt by the shells of the  German Army in 1870. Then disappeared for ever, together with other  unique documents, the original records of the famous law-suits between  Gutenberg, one of the first Printers, and his partners, upon the right  understanding of which depends the claim of Gutenberg to the invention  of the Art. The flames raged between high brick walls, roaring louder  than a blast furnace. Seldom, indeed, have Mars and Pluto had so dainty  a sacrifice offered at their shrines; for over all the din of battle,  and the reverberation of monster artillery, the burning leaves of the  first printed Bible and many another priceless volume were wafted into  the sky, the ashes floating for miles on the heated air, and carrying  to the astonished countryman the first news of the devastation of his  Capital.    When the Offor Collection was put to the hammer by Messrs Sotheby and  Wilkinson, the well-known auctioneers of Wellington Street, and when  about three days of the sale had been gone through, a Fire occurred in  the adjoining house, and, gaining possession of the Sale Rooms, made a  speedy end of the unique Bunyan and other rarities then on show. I was  allowed to see the Ruins on the following day, and by means of a ladder  and some scrambling managed to enter the Sale Room where parts of the  floor still remained. It was a fearful sight those scorched rows of  Volumes still on the shelves; and curious was it to notice how the  flames, burning off the backs of the books first, had then run up behind  the shelves, and so attacked the fore-edge of the volumes standing upon  them, leaving the majority with a perfectly untouched oval centre of  white paper and plain print, while the whole surrounding parts were but  a mass of black cinders. The salvage was sold in one lot for a small  sum, and the purchaser, after a good deal of sorting and mending and  binding placed about 1,000 volumes for sale at Messrs. Puttick and  Simpson's in the following year.    So, too, when the curious old Library which was in a gallery of the  Dutch Church, Austin Friars, was nearly destroyed in the fire which  devastated the Church in 1862, the books which escaped were sadly  injured. Not long before I had spent some hours there hunting for  English Fifteenth-century Books, and shall never forget the state of  dirt in which I came away. Without anyone to care for them, the books  had remained untouched for many a decade-damp dust, half an inch thick,  having settled upon them! Then came the fire, and while the roof was  all ablaze streams of hot water, like a boiling deluge, washed down upon  them. The wonder was they were not turned into a muddy pulp. After all  was over, the whole of the library, no portion of which could legally be  given away, was _lent for ever_ to the Corporation of London. Scorched  and sodden, the salvage came into the hands of Mr. Overall, their  indefatigable librarian. In a hired attic, he hung up the volumes that  would bear it over strings like clothes, to dry, and there for weeks and  weeks were the stained, distorted volumes, often without covers, often  in single leaves, carefully tended and dry-nursed. Washing, sizing,  pressing, and binding effected wonders, and no one who to-day looks  upon the attractive little alcove in the Guildhall Library labelled  <oe \"Bibliotheca Ecclesiae Londonino-Belgiae\"> and sees the rows of  handsomely-lettered backs, could imagine that not long ago this, the  most curious portion of the City's literary collections, was in a state  when a five-pound note would have seemed more than full value for the  lot.
