He stared  about in the darkness. Nothing was visible, not even the outline of one  worm-eaten rafter, nor of the deal table, on which lay the Bible from  which his father had read before they went to bed. No one could tell  where the toolbox was, and where the fireplace. There was something very  impressive to the child in the complete darkness.    At the head of his father's bed hung a great silver hunting watch. It  ticked loudly. The boy listened to it, and began mechanically to count.  Tick--tick--one, two, three, four! He lost count presently, and only  listened. Tick--tick--tick--tick!    It never waited; it went on inexorably; and every time it ticked a man  died! He raised himself a little on his elbow and listened. He wished it  would leave off.    How many times had it ticked since he came to lie down? A thousand  times, a million times, perhaps.    He tried to count again, and sat up to listen better.    \"Dying, dying, dying!\" said the watch; \"dying, dying, dying!\"    He heard it distinctly. Where were they going to, all those people?    He lay down quickly, and pulled the cover up over his head: but  presently the silky curls reappeared.    \"Dying, dying, dying!\" said the watch; \"dying, dying, dying!\"    He thought of the words his father had read that evening--\"For wide is  the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction and many  there be which go in thereat.\"    \"Many, many, many!\" said the watch.    \"Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto  life, and few there be that find it.\"    \"Few, few, few!\" said the watch.    The boy lay with his eyes wide open. He saw before him a long stream of  people, a great dark multitude, that moved in one direction; then they  came to the dark edge of the world and went over. He saw them passing  on before him, and there was nothing that could stop them. He thought of  how that stream had rolled on through all the long ages of the past--how  the old Greeks and Romans had gone over; the countless millions of China  and India, they were going over now. Since he had come to bed, how many  had gone!    And the watch said, \"Eternity, eternity, eternity!\"    \"Stop them! stop them!\" cried the child.    And all the while the watch kept ticking on; just like God's will, that  never changes or alters, you may do what you please.    Great beads of perspiration stood on the boy's forehead. He climbed out  of bed and lay with his face turned to the mud floor.    \"Oh, God, God! save them!\" he cried in agony. \"Only some, only a few!  Only for each moment I am praying here one!\" He folded his little hands  upon his head. \"God! God! save them!\"    He grovelled on the floor.    Oh, the long, long ages of the past, in which they had gone over! Oh,  the long, long future, in which they would pass away! Oh, God! the long,  long, long eternity, which has no end!    The child wept, and crept closer to the ground.    *****      The Sacrifice.    The farm by daylight was not as the farm by moonlight. The plain was a  weary flat of loose red sand, sparsely covered by dry karoo bushes,  that cracked beneath the tread like tinder, and showed the red earth  everywhere. Here and there a milk-bush lifted its pale-coloured rods,  and in every direction the ants and beetles ran about in the  blazing sand. The red walls of the farmhouse, the zinc roofs of the  outbuildings, the stone walls of the kraals, all reflected the fierce  sunlight, till the eye ached and blenched. No tree or shrub was to  be seen far or near. The two sunflowers that stood before the door,  out-stared by the sun, drooped their brazen faces to the sand; and the  little cicada-like insects cried aloud among the stones of the kopje.    The Boer-woman, seen by daylight, was even less lovely than when, in  bed, she rolled and dreamed. She sat on a chair in the great front room,  with her feet on a wooden stove, and wiped her flat face with the corner  of her apron, and drank coffee, and in Cape Dutch swore that the  beloved weather was damned. Less lovely, too, by daylight was the dead  Englishman's child, her little stepdaughter, upon whose freckles and  low, wrinkled forehead the sunlight had no mercy.    \"Lyndall,\" the child said to her little orphan cousin, who sat with her  on the floor threading beads, \"how is it your beads never fall off your  needle?\"    \"I try,\" said the little one gravely, moistening her tiny finger. \"That  is why.\"    The overseer, seen by daylight, was a huge German, wearing a shabby  suit, and with a childish habit of rubbing his hands and nodding his  head prodigiously when pleased at anything. He stood out at the kraals  in the blazing sun, explaining to two Kaffer boys the approaching end  of the world. The boys, as they cut the cakes of dung, winked at each  other, and worked as slowly as they possibly could; but the German never  saw it.    Away, beyond the kopje, Waldo his son herded the ewes and lambs--a  small and dusty herd--powdered all over from head to foot with red sand,  wearing a ragged coat and shoes of undressed leather, through whose  holes the toes looked out. His hat was too large, and had sunk down to  his eyes, concealing completely the silky black curls. It was a curious  small figure. His flock gave him little trouble. It was too hot for them  to move far; they gathered round every little milk-bush, as though they  hoped to find shade, and stood there motionless in clumps. He himself  crept under a shelving rock that lay at the foot of the kopje, stretched  himself on his stomach, and waved his dilapidated little shoes in the  air.    Soon, from the blue bag where he kept his dinner, he produced a fragment  of slate, an arithmetic, and a pencil. Proceeding to put down a sum with  solemn and earnest demeanour, he began to add it up aloud: \"Six and  two is eight--and four is twelve--and two is fourteen--and four  is eighteen.\" Here he paused. \"And four is eighteen--and--four--is,  eighteen.\" The last was very much drawled. Slowly the pencil slipped  from his fingers, and the slate followed it into the sand. For a while  he lay motionless, then began muttering to himself, folded his little  arms, laid his head down upon them, and might have been asleep, but for  the muttering sound that from time to time proceeded from him. A curious  old ewe came to sniff at him; but it was long before he raised his head.  When he did, he looked at the far-off hills with his heavy eyes.    \"Ye shall receive--ye shall receive--shall, shall, shall,\" he muttered.    He sat up then. Slowly the dulness and heaviness melted from his face;  it became radiant. Midday had come now, and the sun's rays were poured  down vertically; the earth throbbed before the eye.    The boy stood up quickly, and cleared a small space from the bushes  which covered it. Looking carefully, he found twelve small stones of  somewhat the same size; kneeling down, he arranged them carefully on the  cleared space in a square pile, in shape like an altar. Then he walked  to the bag where his dinner was kept; in it was a mutton chop and a  large slice of brown bread. The boy took them out and turned the bread  over in his hand, deeply considering it. Finally he threw it away and  walked to the altar with the meat, and laid it down on the stones. Close  by in the red sand he knelt down. Sure, never since the beginning of the  world was there so ragged and so small a priest. He took off his great  hat and placed it solemnly on the ground, then closed his eyes and  folded his hands. He prayed aloud:    \"Oh, God, my Father, I have made Thee a sacrifice. I have only twopence,  so I cannot buy a lamb. If the lambs were mine, I would give Thee one;  but now I have only this meat; it is my dinner meat. Please, my Father,  send fire down from heaven to burn it. Thou hast said, Whosoever shall  say unto this mountain, Be thou cast into the sea, nothing doubting, it  shall be done. I ask for the sake of Jesus Christ. Amen.\"    He knelt down with his face upon the ground, and he folded his hands  upon his curls. The fierce sun poured down its heat upon his head and  upon his altar. When he looked up he knew what he should see--the glory  of God! For fear his very heart stood still, his breath came heavily;  he was half suffocated. He dared not look up. Then at last he raised  himself. Above him was the quiet blue sky, about him the red earth;  there were the clumps of silent ewes and his altar--that was all.    He looked up--nothing broke the intense stillness of the blue overhead.  He looked round in astonishment, then he bowed again, and this time  longer than before.    When he raised himself the second time all was unaltered. Only the sun  had melted the fat of the little mutton chop, and it ran down upon the  stones.    Then, the third time he bowed himself. When at last he looked up, some  ants had come to the meat on the altar. He stood up and drove them away.  Then he put his hat on his hot curls, and sat in the shade. He clasped  his hands about his knees. He sat to watch what would come to pass. The  glory of the Lord God Almighty! He knew he should see it.    \"My dear God is trying me,\" he said; and he sat there through the fierce  heat of the afternoon. Still he watched and waited when the sun began to  slope, and when it neared the horizon and the sheep began to cast long  shadows across the karoo, he still sat there. He hoped when the first  rays touched the hills till the sun dipped behind them and was gone.  Then he called his ewes together, and broke down the altar, and threw  the meat far, far away into the field.    He walked home behind his flock. His heart was heavy. He reasoned so:  \"God cannot lie. I had faith. No fire came. I am like Cain--I am not  His. He will not hear my prayer. God hates me.\"    The boy's heart was heavy. When he reached the kraal gate the two girls  met him.    \"Come,\" said the yellow-haired Em, \"let us play coop. There is"]]]
