[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#2)"],[1,"the fourteenth or fifteenth  century of the present era, the great age of the Hindu plays would of  itself be a most interesting and attractive circumstance, even if  their poetical merit were not of a very high order. But when to the  antiquity of these productions is added their extreme beauty and  excellence as literary compositions, and when we also take into  account their value as representations of the early condition of Hindu  society--which, notwithstanding the lapse of two thousand years, has  in many particulars obeyed the law of unchangeableness ever stamped on  the manners and customs of the East--we are led to wonder that the  study of the Indian drama has not commended itself in a greater degree  to the attention of Europeans, and especially of Englishmen. The  English student, at least, is bound by considerations of duty, as well  as curiosity, to make himself acquainted with a subject which  elucidates and explains the condition of the millions of Hindus who  owe allegiance to his own Sovereign, and are governed by English laws.    Of all the Indian dramatists, indeed of all Indian poets, the most  celebrated is Kalidasa, the writer of the present play. The late  Professor Lassen thought it probable that he flourished about the  middle of the third century after Christ. Professor Kielhorn of  Goettingen has proved that the composer of the Mandasor Inscription  (A.D. 472) knew Kalidasa's Ritusamhara. Hence it may be inferred that  Lassen was not far wrong[1]. Possibly some King named Vikramaditya  received Kalidasa at his Court, and honoured him by his patronage  about that time. Little, however, is known of the circumstances of his  life. There is certainly no satisfactory evidence to be adduced in  support of the tradition current in India that he lived in the time  of the _great_ King Vikramaditya I., whose capital was Ujjayini, now  Oujein.    From the absence of historical literature in India, our knowledge of  the state of Hindustan between the incursion of Alexander and the  Muhammadan conquest is very slight. But it is ascertained with  tolerable accuracy that, after the invasion of the kingdoms of Bactria  and Afghanistan, the Tartars or Scythians (called by the Hindus  '[S']akas') overran the north-western provinces of India, and retained  possession of them. The great Vikramaditya or Vikramarka succeeded in  driving back the barbaric hordes beyond the Indus, and so consolidated  his empire that it extended over the whole of Northern Hindustan. His  name is even now cherished among the Hindus with pride and affection.  His victory over the Scythians is believed to have taken place about  B.C. 57. At any rate this is the starting-point of the Vikrama (also  called the Malava and in later times the Samvat) era, one of the  epochs from which the Hindus still continue to count. There is good  authority for affirming that the reign of this Vikramarka or  Vikramaditya was equal in brilliancy to that of any monarch in any  age. He was a liberal patron of science and literature, and gave  splendid encouragement to poets, philologists, astronomers, and  mathematicians. Nine illustrious men of genius are said to have  adorned his Court, and to have been supported by his bounty. They were  called the 'Nine Gems'; and a not unnatural tradition, which, however,  must be considered untrustworthy, included Kalidasa among the Nine.    To Kalidasa (as to another celebrated Indian Dramatist, Bhavabhuti,  who probably flourished in the eighth century) only three plays are  attributed; and of these the '[S']akoontala' (here translated) has  acquired the greatest celebrity [2].    Indeed, the popularity of this play with the natives of India exceeds  that of any other dramatic, and probably of any other poetical  composition [3]. But it is not in India alone that the '[S']akoontala' is  known and admired. Its excellence is now recognized in every  literary circle throughout the continent of Europe; and its beauties,  if not yet universally known and appreciated, are at least  acknowledged by many learned men in every country of the civilized  world. The four well-known lines of Goethe, so often quoted in  relation to the Indian drama, may here be repeated:      'Willst du die Bluethe des fruehen, die Fruechte des      spaeteren Jahres,    Willst du was reizt und entzueckt, willst du was saettigt      und naehrt,    Willst du den Himmel, die Erde, mit einem Namen      begreifen:    Nenn' ich, [S']akoontala, Dich, und so ist Alles gesagt.'      'Would'st thou the young year's blossoms and the fruits      of its decline,    And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured,      feasted, fed?    Would'st thou the Earth and Heaven itself in one sole      name combine?    I name thee, O [S']akoontala! and all at once is said.'     _E.B. Eastwick_.    Augustus William von Schlegel, in his first Lecture on Dramatic  Literature, says: 'Among the Indians, the people from whom perhaps all  the cultivation of the human race has been derived, plays were known  long before they could have experienced any foreign influence. It has  lately been made known in Europe that they have a rich dramatic  literature, which ascends back for more than two thousand years. The  only specimen of their plays (Nataks) hitherto known to us is the  delightful [S']akoontala, which, notwithstanding the colouring of a  foreign clime, bears in its general structure a striking resemblance  to our romantic drama.'    Alexander von Humboldt, in treating of Indian poetry, observes:  'Kalidasa, the celebrated author of the [S']akoontala, is a masterly  describer of the influence which Nature exercises upon the minds of  lovers. This great poet flourished at the splendid court of  Vikramaditya, and was, therefore, cotemporary with Virgil and Horace.  Tenderness in the expression of feeling, and richness of creative  fancy, have assigned to him his lofty place among the poets of all  nations'.    These considerations induced me, in 1853, to compile and publish an  edition of the text of the '[S']akoontala' from various original MSS.,  with English translations of the metrical passages, and explanatory  notes. A second edition of this work has since been published by the  Delegates of the Oxford University Press. To the notes of that edition  I must refer all students of Sanskrit literature who desire a close  and literal translation of the present drama, and in the Preface will  be found an account of various other editions and translations.    The following pages contain a  _free_ translation, and the first  English version in prose and metre, of the purest recension of the  most celebrated drama of the Shakespeare of India.    The need felt by the British public for some such translation as I  have here offered can scarcely be questioned. A great people, who,  through their empire in India, command the destinies of the Eastern  world, ought surely to be conversant with the most popular of Indian  dramas, in which the customs of the Hindus, their opinions,  prejudices, and fables, their religious rites, daily occupations and  amusements, are reflected as in a mirror. Nor is the prose translation  of Sir W. Jones (excellent though it be) adapted to meet the  requirements of modern times. That translation was unfortunately made  from corrupt manuscripts (the best that could then be procured), in  which the bold phraseology of Kalidasa has been occasionally weakened,  his delicate expressions of refined love clothed in an unbecoming  dress, and his ideas, grand in their simplicity, diluted by repetition  or amplification. It is, moreover, altogether unfurnished with  explanatory annotations. The present translation, on the contrary,  while representing the purest version of the drama, has abundant  notes, sufficient to answer the exigencies of the non-oriental  scholar.    It may be remarked that in every Sanskrit play the women and inferior  characters speak a kind of provincial dialect or _patois_, called  Prakrit--bearing the relation to Sanskrit that Italian bears to Latin,  or that the spoken Latin of the age of Cicero bore to the highly  polished Latin in which he delivered his Orations. Even the heroine of  the drama is made to speak in the vernacular dialect. The hero, on the  other hand, and all the higher male characters, speak in Sanskrit; and  as if to invest them with greater dignity, half of what they say is in  verse. Indeed the prose part of their speeches is often very  commonplace, being only introductory to the lofty sentiment of the  poetry that follows. Thus, if the whole composition be compared to a  web, the prose will correspond to the warp, or that part which is  extended lengthwise in the loom, while the metrical portion will  answer to the cross-threads which constitute the woof.    The original verses are written in a great variety of Sanskrit metres.  For example, the first thirty-four verses of '[S']akoontala' exhibit  eleven different varieties of metre. No English metrical system could  give any idea of the almost infinite resources of Sanskrit in this  respect. Nor have I attempted it. Blank verse has been employed by me  in my translation, as more in unison with the character of our own  dramatic writings, and rhyming stanzas have only been admitted when  the subject-matter seemed to call for such a change. Perhaps the chief  consideration that induced me to adopt this mode of metrical  translation was, that the free and unfettered character of the verse  enabled me to preserve more of the freshness and vigour of the  original. If the poetical ideas of Kalidasa have not been expressed in  language as musical as his own, I have at least done my best to avoid  diluting them by unwarrantable paraphrases or additions. If the  English verses are prosaic, I have the satisfaction of knowing that by  resisting the allurements of rhyme, I have done all in my power to  avoid substituting a fictitious and meagre poem of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#2)"],[1,"the  matter with the patient?\"    \"No, sir, I can't,\" he replied; and he went out to see to the carriage.    I slipped into a bag an assortment of emergency drugs and a few  diagnostic instruments, turned down the gas and passed out through the  surgery. The carriage was standing at the kerb, guarded by the coachman  and watched with deep interest by the bottle-boy. I viewed it with  mingled curiosity and disfavour. It was a kind of large brougham, such  as is used by some commercial travellers, the usual glass windows being  replaced by wooden shutters intended to conceal the piles of  sample-boxes, and the doors capable of being locked from outside with a  railway key.    As I emerged from the house, the coachman unlocked the door and held it  open.    \"How long will the journey take?\" I asked, pausing with my foot on the  step.    The coachman considered a moment or two and replied:    \"It took me, I should say, nigh upon half an hour to get here.\"    This was pleasant hearing. A half an hour each way and a half an hour at  the patient's house. At that rate it would be half-past ten before I was  home again, and then it was quite probable that I should find some other  untimely messenger waiting on the doorstep. With a muttered anathema on  the unknown Mr. Graves and the unrestful life of a locum tenens, I  stepped into the uninviting vehicle. Instantly the coachman slammed the  door and turned the key, leaving me in total darkness.    One comfort was left to me; my pipe was in my pocket. I made shift to  load it in the dark, and, having lit it with a wax match, took the  opportunity to inspect the interior of my prison. It was a shabby  affair. The moth-eaten state of the blue cloth cushions seemed to  suggest that it had been long out of regular use; the oil-cloth  floor-covering was worn into holes; ordinary internal fittings there  were none. But the appearances suggested that the crazy vehicle had been  prepared with considerable forethought for its present use. The inside  handles of the doors had apparently been removed; the wooden shutters  were permanently fixed in their places; and a paper label, stuck on the  transom below each window, had a suspicious appearance of having been  put there to cover the painted name and address of the job-master or  livery-stable keeper who had originally owned the carriage.    These observations gave me abundant food for reflection. This Mr. Weiss  must be an excessively conscientious man if he had considered that his  promise to Mr. Graves committed him to such extraordinary precautions.  Evidently no mere following of the letter of the law was enough to  satisfy his sensitive conscience. Unless he had reasons for sharing Mr.  Graves's unreasonable desire for secrecy--for one could not suppose that  these measures of concealment had been taken by the patient himself.    The further suggestions that evolved themselves from this consideration  were a little disquieting. Whither was I being carried and for what  purpose? The idea that I was bound for some den of thieves where I  might be robbed and possibly murdered, I dismissed with a smile. Thieves  do not make elaborately concerted plans to rob poor devils like me.  Poverty has its compensations in that respect. But there were other  possibilities. Imagination backed by experience had no difficulty in  conjuring up a number of situations in which a medical man might be  called upon, with or without coercion, either to witness or actively to  participate in the commission of some unlawful act.    Reflections of this kind occupied me pretty actively if not very  agreeably during this strange journey. And the monotony was relieved,  too, by other distractions. I was, for example, greatly interested to  notice how, when one sense is in abeyance, the other senses rouse into a  compensating intensity of perception. I sat smoking my pipe in darkness  which was absolute save for the dim glow from the smouldering tobacco in  the bowl, and seemed to be cut off from all knowledge of the world  without. But yet I was not. The vibrations of the carriage, with its  hard springs and iron-tired wheels, registered accurately and plainly  the character of the roadway. The harsh rattle of granite setts, the  soft bumpiness of macadam, the smooth rumble of wood-pavement, the  jarring and swerving of crossed tram-lines; all were easily recognizable  and together sketched the general features of the neighbourhood through  which I was passing. And the sense of hearing filled in the details. Now  the hoot of a tug's whistle told of proximity to the river. A sudden  and brief hollow reverberation announced the passage under a railway  arch (which, by the way, happened several times during the journey);  and, when I heard the familiar whistle of a railway-guard followed by  the quick snorts of a skidding locomotive, I had as clear a picture of a  heavy passenger-train moving out of a station as if I had seen it in  broad daylight.    I had just finished my pipe and knocked out the ashes on the heel of my  boot, when the carriage slowed down and entered a covered way--as I  could tell by the hollow echoes. Then I distinguished the clang of heavy  wooden gates closed behind me, and a moment or two later the carriage  door was unlocked and opened. I stepped out blinking into a covered  passage paved with cobbles and apparently leading down to a mews; but it  was all in darkness, and I had no time to make any detailed  observations, as the carriage had drawn up opposite a side door which  was open and in which stood a woman holding a lighted candle.    \"Is that the doctor?\" she asked, speaking with a rather pronounced  German accent and shading the candle with her hand as she peered at me.    I answered in the affirmative, and she then exclaimed:    \"I am glad you have come. Mr. Weiss will be so relieved. Come in,  please.\"    I followed her across a dark passage into a dark room, where she set the  candle down on a chest of drawers and turned to depart. At the door,  however, she paused and looked back.    \"It is not a very nice room to ask you into,\" she said. \"We are very  untidy just now, but you must excuse us. We have had so much anxiety  about poor Mr. Graves.\"    \"He has been ill some time, then?\"    \"Yes. Some little time. At intervals, you know. Sometimes better,  sometimes not so well.\"    As she spoke, she gradually backed out into the passage but did not go  away at once. I accordingly pursued my inquiries.    \"He has not been seen by any doctor, has he?\"    \"No,\" she answered, \"he has always refused to see a doctor. That has  been a great trouble to us. Mr. Weiss has been very anxious about him.  He will be so glad to hear that you have come. I had better go and tell  him. Perhaps you will kindly sit down until he is able to come to you,\"  and with this she departed on her mission.    It struck me as a little odd that, considering his anxiety and the  apparent urgency of the case, Mr. Weiss should not have been waiting to  receive me. And when several minutes elapsed without his appearing, the  oddness of the circumstance impressed me still more. Having no desire,  after the journey in the carriage, to sit down, I whiled away the time  by an inspection of the room. And a very curious room it was; bare,  dirty, neglected and, apparently, unused. A faded carpet had been flung  untidily on the floor. A small, shabby table stood in the middle of the  room; and beyond this, three horsehair-covered chairs and a chest of  drawers formed the entire set of furniture. No pictures hung on the  mouldy walls, no curtains covered the shuttered windows, and the dark  drapery of cobwebs that hung from the ceiling to commemorate a long and  illustrious dynasty of spiders hinted at months of neglect and disuse.    The chest of drawers--an incongruous article of furniture for what  seemed to be a dining-room--as being the nearest and best lighted object  received most of my attention. It was a fine old chest of nearly black  mahogany, very battered and in the last stage of decay, but originally a  piece of some pretensions. Regretful of its fallen estate, I looked it  over with some interest and had just observed on its lower corner a  little label bearing the printed inscription \"Lot 201\" when I heard  footsteps descending the stairs. A moment later the door opened and a  shadowy figure appeared standing close by the threshold.    \"Good evening, doctor,\" said the stranger, in a deep, quiet voice and  with a distinct, though not strong, German accent. \"I must apologize for  keeping you waiting.\"    I acknowledged the apology somewhat stiffly and asked: \"You are Mr.  Weiss, I presume?\"    \"Yes, I am Mr. Weiss. It is very good of you to come so far and so late  at night and to make no objection to the absurd conditions that my poor  friend has imposed.\"    \"Not at all,\" I replied. \"It is my business to go when and where I am  wanted, and it is not my business to inquire into the private affairs of  my patients.\"    \"That is very true, sir,\" he agreed cordially, \"and I am much obliged  to you for taking that very proper view of the case. I pointed that out  to my friend, but he is not a very reasonable man. He is very secretive  and rather suspicious by nature.\"    \"So I inferred. And as to his condition; is he seriously ill?\"    \"Ah,\" said Mr. Weiss, \"that is what I want you to tell me. I am very  much puzzled about him.\"    \"But what is the nature of his illness? What does he complain of?\"    \"He makes very few complaints of any kind although he is obviously ill.  But the fact is that he is hardly ever more than half awake. He lies in  a kind of dreamy stupor from morning to night.\"    This struck me as excessively strange and by no means in agreement with  the patient's energetic refusal to see a doctor.    \"But,\" I asked, \"does he never rouse completely?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" Mr. Weiss answered quickly; \"he rouses from time to time and  is then"]]]
