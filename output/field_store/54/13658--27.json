NOTE.--A saddle of muton or double loin is two loins cut off before  the carcass is split open down the back. French chops are a small rib  chop, the end of the bone trimmed off and the meat and fat cut away  from the thin end, leaving the round piece of meat attached to the  larger end, which leaves the small rib-bone bare. Very tender and  sweet.    Mutton is _prime_ when cut from a carcass which has been fed out of  doors, and allowed to run upon the hillside; they are best when about  three years old. The fat will then be abundant, white and hard, the  flesh juicy and firm, and of a clear red color.    For mutton roasts, choose the shoulder, the saddle, or the loin or  haunch. The leg should be boiled. Almost any part will do for broth.    Lamb born in the middle of the winter, reared under shelter, and fed  in a great measure upon milk, then killed in the spring, is considered  a great delicacy, though lamb is good at a year old. Like all young  animals, lamb ought to be thoroughly cooked, or it is most  unwholesome.      [Illustration]    PORK.      No. 1. Leg, used for smoked hams, roasts and corned pork.    No. 2. Hind-loin, used for roasts, chops and baked dishes.    No. 3. Fore-loin or ribs, used for roasts, baked dishes or chops.    No. 4. Spare-rib, used for roasts, chops, stews.    No. 5. Shoulder, used for smoked shoulder, roasts and corned pork.    No. 6. Brisket and flank, used for pickling in salt and smoked bacon.      The cheek is used for pickling in salt, also the shank or shin. The  feet are usually used for souse and jelly.    For family use the leg is the most economical, that is when fresh, and  the loin the richest. The best pork is from carcasses weighing from  fifty to about one hundred and twenty-five pounds. Pork is a white and  close meat, and it is almost impossible to over-roast or cook it too  much; when underdone it is exceedingly unwholesome.      [Illustration]    VENISON.      No. 1. Shoulder, used for roasting; it may be boned and stuffed, then  afterwards baked or roasted.    No. 2. Fore-loin, used for roasts and steaks.    No. 3. Haunch or loin, used for roasts, steaks, stews. The ribs cut  close may be used for soups. Good for pickling and making into smoked  venison.    No. 4. Breast, used for baking dishes, stewing.    No. 5. Scrag or neck, used for soups.      The choice of venison should be judged by the fat, which, when the  venison is young, should be thick, clear and close, and the meat a  very dark red. The flesh of a female deer about four years old, is the  sweetest and best of venison.    Buck venison, which is in season from June to the end of September, is  finer than doe venison, which is in season from October to December.  Neither should be dressed at any other time of year, and no meat  requires so much care as venison in killing, preserving and dressing.      [Illustration:]    SIRLOIN OF BEEF.    This choice roasting-piece should be cut with one good firm stroke  from end to end of the joint, at the upper part, in thin, long, even  slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, cutting across the  grain, serving each guest with some of the fat with the lean; this may  be done by cutting a small, thin slice from underneath the bone from 5  to 6, through the tenderloin.    Another way of carving this piece, and which will be of great  assistance in doing it well, is to insert the knife just above the  bone at the bottom, and run sharply along, dividing the meat from the  bone at the bottom and end, thus leaving it perfectly flat; then carve  in long, thin slices the usual way. When the bone has been removed and  the sirloin rolled before it is cooked, it is laid upon the platter on  one end, and an even, thin slice is carved across the grain of the  upper surface.    Roast ribs should be carved in thin, even slices from the thick end  towards the thin in the same manner as the sirloin; this can be more  easily and cleanly done if the carving knife is first run along  between the meat and the end and rib-bones, thus leaving it free from  bone to be cut into slices.    _Tongue_.--To carve this it should be cut crosswise, the middle being  the best; cut in very _thin_ slices, thereby improving its delicacy,  making it more tempting; as is the case of all well-carved meats. The  root of the tongue is usually left on the platter.      [Illustration]    BREAST OF VEAL.    This piece is quite similar to a fore-quarter of lamb after the  shoulder has been taken off. A breast of veal consists of two parts,  the rib-bones and the gristly brisket. These parts may be separated by  sharply passing the carving knife in the direction of the line from 1  to 2; and when they are entirely divided, the rib-bones should be  carved in the direction of the line from 5 to 6, and the brisket can  be helped by cutting slices from 3 to 4.    The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for  the brisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with the  dish, as is frequently with this roast of veal, each person should  receive a piece.    Though veal and lamb contain less nutrition than beef and mutton, in  proportion to their weight, they are often preferred to these latter  meats on account of their delicacy of texture and flavor. A whole  breast of veal weighs from nine to twelve pounds.      [Illustration]    A FILLET OF VEAL.    A fillet of veal is one of the prime roasts of veal; it is taken from  the leg above the knuckle; a piece weighing from ten to twelve pounds  is a good size and requires about four hours for roasting. Before  roasting, it is dressed with a force meat or stuffing placed in the  cavity from where the bone was taken out and the flap tightly secured  together with skewers; many bind it together with tape.    To carve it, cut in even thin slices off from the whole of the upper  part or top, in the same manner as from a rolled roast of beef, as in  the direction of the figs. 1 and 2; this gives the person served some  of the dressing with each slice of meat.    Veal is very unwholesome unless it is cooked thoroughly, and when  roasted should be of a rich brown color. Bacon, fried pork,  sausage-balls, with greens, are among the accompaniments of roasted  veal, also a cut lemon.      [Illustration]    NECK OF VEAL.    The best end of a neck of veal makes a very good roasting-piece; it,  however, is composed of bone and ribs that make it quite difficult to  carve, unless it is done properly. To attempt to carve each chop and  serve it, you would not only place _too_ large a piece upon the plate  of the person you intend to serve, but you would waste much time, and  should the vertebrae have not been removed by the butcher, you would be  compelled to exercise such a degree of strength that would make one's  appearance very ungraceful, and possibly, too, throwing gravy over  your neighbor sitting next to you. The correct way to carve this roast  is to cut diagonally from fig. 1 to 2, and help in slices of moderate  thickness; then it may be cut from 3 to 4, in order to separate the  small bones; divide and serve them, having first inquired if they are  desired.    This joint is usually sent to the table accompanied by bacon, ham,  tongue, or pickled pork, on a separate dish and with a cut lemon on a  plate. There are also a number of sauces that are suitable with this  roast.      [Illustration]    LEG OF MUTTON.    The best mutton, and that from which most nourishment is obtained is  that of sheep from three to six years old, and which have been fed on  dry, sweet pastures; then mutton is in its _prime_, the flesh being  firm, juicy, dark colored and full of the richest gravy. When mutton  is two years old, the meat is flabby, pale and savorless.    In carving a roasted leg, the best slices are found by cutting quite  down to the bone, in the direction from 1 to 2, and slices may be  taken from either side.    Some very good cuts are taken from the broad end from 5 to 6, and the  fat on this ridge is very much liked by many. The cramp-bone is a  delicacy, and is obtained by cutting down to the bone at 4, and  running the knife under it in a semicircular"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],[0,"The Mysterious Rider (#2)"],[1,"above all a life in the open. Unlike most cowboys, he had been to  school; he had a family in Denver that objected to his wild range life,  and often importuned him to come home; he seemed aloof sometimes and not  readily understood.    While many thoughts whirled through Columbine's mind she watched the  cowboy ride slowly down to her, and she became more concerned with a  sudden restraint. How was Wilson going to take the news of this forced  change about to come in her life? That thought leaped up. It gave her a  strange pang. But she and he were only good friends. As to that, she  reflected, of late they had not been the friends and comrades they  formerly were. In the thrilling uncertainty of this meeting she had  forgotten his distant manner and the absence of little attentions she  had missed.    By this time the cowboy had reached the level, and with the lazy grace  of his kind slipped out of the saddle. He was tall, slim, round-limbed,  with the small hips of a rider, and square, though not broad shoulders.  He stood straight like an Indian. His eyes were hazel, his features  regular, his face bronzed. All men of the open had still, lean, strong  faces, but added to this in him was a steadiness of expression, a  restraint that seemed to hide sadness.    \"Howdy, Columbine!\" he said. \"What are you doing up here? You might get  run over.\"    \"Hello, Wils!\" she replied, slowly. \"Oh, I guess I can keep out of the  way.\"    \"Some bad steers in that bunch. If any of them run over here Pronto will  leave you to walk home. That mustang hates cattle. And he's only half  broke, you know.\"    \"I forgot you were driving to-day,\" she replied, and looked away from  him. There was a moment's pause--long, it seemed to her.    \"What'd you come for?\" he asked, curiously.    \"I wanted to gather columbines. See.\" She held out the nodding flowers  toward him. \"Take one.... Do you like them?\"    \"Yes. I like columbine,\" he replied, taking one of them. His keen hazel  eyes, softened, darkened. \"Colorado's flower.\"    \"Columbine!... It is my name.\"    \"Well, could you have a better? It sure suits you.\"    \"Why?\" she asked, and she looked at him again.    \"You're slender--graceful. You sort of hold your head high and proud.  Your skin is white. Your eyes are blue. Not bluebell blue, but columbine  blue--and they turn purple when you're angry.\"    \"Compliments! Wilson, this is new kind of talk for you,\" she said.    \"You're different to-day.\"    \"Yes, I am.\" She looked across the valley toward the westering sun, and  the slight flush faded from her cheeks. \"I have no right to hold my head  proud. No one knows who I am--where I came from.\"    \"As if that made any difference!\" he exclaimed.    \"Belllounds is not my dad. I have no dad. I was a waif. They found me in  the woods--a baby--lost among the flowers. Columbine Belllounds I've  always been. But that is not my name. No one can tell what my name  really is.\"    \"I knew your story years ago, Columbine,\" he replied, earnestly.  \"Everybody knows. Old Bill ought to have told you long before this. But  he loves you. So does--everybody. You must not let this knowledge sadden  you.... I'm sorry you've never known a mother or a sister. Why, I could  tell you of many orphans who--whose stories were different.\"    \"You don't understand. I've been happy. I've not longed for any--any one  except a mother. It's only--\"    \"What don't I understand?\"    \"I've not told you all.\"    \"No? Well, go on,\" he said, slowly.    Meaning of the hesitation and the restraint that had obstructed her  thought now flashed over Columbine. It lay in what Wilson Moore might  think of her prospective marriage to Jack Belllounds. Still she could  not guess why that should make her feel strangely uncertain of the  ground she stood on or how it could cause a constraint she had to fight  herself to hide. Moreover, to her annoyance, she found that she was  evading his direct request for the news she had withheld.    \"Jack Belllounds is coming home to-night or to-morrow,\" she said. Then,  waiting for her companion to reply, she kept an unseeing gaze upon the  scanty pines fringing Old White Slides. But no reply appeared to be  forthcoming from Moore. His silence compelled her to turn to him. The  cowboy's face had subtly altered; it was darker with a tinge of red  under the bronze; and his lower lip was released from his teeth, even  as she looked. He had his eyes intent upon the lasso he was coiling.  Suddenly he faced her and the dark fire of his eyes gave her a shock.    I've been expecting that shorthorn back for months.\" he said, bluntly.    \"You--never--liked Jack?\" queried Columbine, slowly. That was not what  she wanted to say, but the thought spoke itself.    \"I should smile I never did.\"    \"Ever since you and he fought--long ago--all over--\"    His sharp gesture made the coiled lasso loosen.    \"Ever since I licked him good--don't forget that,\" interrupted Wilson.  The red had faded from the bronze.    \"Yes, you licked him,\" mused Columbine. \"I remember that. And Jack's  hated you ever since.\"    \"There's been no love lost.\"    \"But, Wils, you never before talked this way--spoke out so--against  Jack,\" she protested.    \"Well, I'm not the kind to talk behind a fellow's back. But I'm not  mealy-mouthed, either, and--and--\"    He did not complete the sentence and his meaning was enigmatic.  Altogether Moore seemed not like himself. The fact disturbed Columbine.  Always she had confided in him. Here was a most complex situation--she  burned to tell him, yet somehow feared to--she felt an incomprehensible  satisfaction in his bitter reference to Jack--she seemed to realize that  she valued Wilson's friendship more than she had known, and now for some  strange reason it was slipping from her.    \"We--we were such good friends--pards,\" said Columbine, hurriedly and  irrelevantly.    \"Who?\" He stared at her.    \"Why, you--and me.\"    \"Oh!\" His tone softened, but there was still disapproval in his glance.  \"What of that?\"    \"Something has happened to make me think I've missed you--lately--that's  all.\"    \"Ahuh!\" His tone held finality and bitterness, but he would not commit  himself. Columbine sensed a pride in him that seemed the cause of his  aloofness.    \"Wilson, why have you been different lately?\" she asked, plaintively.    \"What's the good to tell you now?\" he queried, in reply.    That gave her a blank sense of actual loss. She had lived in dreams and  he in realities. Right now she could not dispel her dream--see and  understand all that he seemed to. She felt like a child, then, growing  old swiftly. The strange past longing for a mother surged up in her like  a strong tide. Some one to lean on, some one who loved her, some one to  help her in this hour when fatality knocked at the door of her  youth--how she needed that!    \"It might be bad for me--to tell me, but tell me, anyhow,\" she said,  finally, answering as some one older than she had been an hour ago--to  something feminine that leaped up. She did not understand this impulse,  but it was in her.    \"No!\" declared Moore, with dark red staining his face. He slapped the  lasso against his saddle, and tied it with clumsy hands. He did not look  at her. His tone expressed anger and amaze.    \"Dad says I must marry Jack,\" she said, with a sudden return to her  natural simplicity.    \"I heard him tell that months ago,\" snapped Moore.    \"You did! Was that--why?\" she whispered.    \"It was,\" he answered, ringingly.    \"But that was no reason for you to be--be--to stay away from me,\" she  declared, with rising spirit.    He laughed shortly.    \"Wils, didn't you like me any more after dad said that?\" she queried.    \"Columbine, a girl nineteen years and about to--to get married--ought  not be a fool,\" he replied, with sarcasm.    \"I'm not a fool,\" she rejoined, hotly.    \"You ask fool questions.\"    \"Well, you _didn't_ like me afterward or you'd never have mistreated  me.\"    \"If you say I mistreated you--you say what's untrue,\" he replied, just  as hotly.    They had never been so near a quarrel before. Columbine experienced a  sensation new to her--a commingling of fear, heat, and pang, it seemed,  all in one throb. Wilson was hurting her. A quiver ran all over her,  along her veins, swelling and tingling.    \"You mean I lie?\" she flashed.    \"Yes, I do--if--\"    But before he could conclude she slapped his face. It grew pale then,  while she began to tremble.    \"Oh--I didn't intend that. Forgive me,\" she faltered.    He rubbed his cheek. The hurt had not been great, so far as the blow was  concerned. But his eyes were dark with pain and anger.    \"Oh, don't distress yourself,\" he burst out. \"You slapped me  before--once, years ago--for kissing you. I--I apologize for saying you  lied. You're only out of your head. So am I.\"    That poured oil upon the troubled waters. The cowboy appeared to be  hesitating between sudden flight and the risk of staying longer.    \"Maybe that's it,\" replied Columbine, with a half-laugh. She was not  far from tears and fury with herself. \"Let us make up--be  friends again.\"    Moore squared around aggressively. He seemed to fortify himself against  something in her. She felt that. But his face grew harder and older than  she had ever seen it.    \"Columbine, do you know where Jack Belllounds has been for these three  years?\" he asked, deliberately, entirely ignoring her overtures of  friendship.    \"No. Somebody said Denver. Some one else said Kansas City. I never asked  dad, because I knew Jack had been sent away. I've supposed he was  working--making a man of himself.\"    \"Well, I hope to Heaven--for your sake--what you suppose comes true,\"  returned Moore, with exceeding bitterness.    \"Do _you_ know where he has been?\" asked Columbine. Some strange feeling  prompted that. There was a mystery here. Wilson's agitation seemed  strange and deep.    \"Yes, I do.\" The cowboy bit that out through closing teeth, as if  "]]]
