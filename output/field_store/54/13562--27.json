They may be either hot or cold  and made of anything that can be utilized for a sandwich filling. The  foundation bread should be two days old and may be toasted or fried  crouton fashion. The nicest way is to butter it lightly, then set it in  a hot oven to brown delicately, or fry in hot fat.    The bread should be cut oblong, diamond shaped, in rounds, or with a  cutter that has a fluted edge. While the toast is quite hot, spread with  the prepared mixture and serve on a small plate with sprigs of  watercress or points of lemon as a garnish.    Another way is to cut the bread into delicate fingers, pile it log-cabin  fashion, and garnish the centre with a stuffed olive. For cheese canapes  sprinkle the toast thickly with grated cheese, well seasoned with salt  and pepper. Set in a hot oven until the cheese melts and serve  immediately.      SARDINE CANAPES    Toast lightly diamond-shaped slices of stale bread and spread with a  sardine mixture made as follows:--Skin and bone six sardines, put them  in a bowl and run to a paste with a silver spoon. Add two tablespoons of  lemon juice, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, a dash of pepper, two  teaspoons of chopped parsley and four tablespoons of creamed butter.  Garnish with a border of whites of hard-boiled eggs, finely chopped, and  on top scatter shredded olives.      WHITE CAVIAR    Take roe of any fish, remove skin, salt; set aside over night. Next day  beat roe apart, pour boiling water over it and stir; when roe is white,  pour off the water and let drain; then put in pan with two tablespoons  of oil and salt, pepper, a little vinegar, and mix well. Let stand a few  days before using.    This caviar may be substituted in all recipes for the Russian caviar or  domestic caviar may be procured in some shops.      CAVIAR CANAPES    Cut the bread about one-quarter of an inch thick and two inches square  (or round), and after it is toasted spread over each slice a teaspoon of  ice cold caviar. Mix one teaspoon of chopped onion and one teaspoon  chopped parsley; spread the mixture over the caviar and serve with  quarters of lemon.      ANCHOVY CANAPES    Cut the bread as for caviar canapes and spread with anchovy paste. Chop  separately the yolks and whites of hard-boiled eggs and cover the  canapes, dividing them into quarters, with anchovies split in two  lengthwise, and using yolks and whites in alternate quarters.      ANCHOVY CANAPES WITH TOMATOES    For each person take a thin slice toast covered with anchovy paste. Upon  this place whole egg which has been boiled four minutes, so that it can  be pealed whole and the yolk is still soft. Around the toast put tomato  sauce.      CHOPPED ONION AND CHICKEN FAT    Chop one yellow onion very fine, add four tablespoons of chicken fat  (melted), salt to taste. Serve on slices of rye bread. If desired, a  hard-boiled egg chopped very fine may be mixed with the onions.      BRAIN (APPETIZER)    Cook brains, let cool and add salt; beat up with chopped onions, juice  of one and a half lemons and olive oil. Serve on lettuce leaves.      BLACK OLIVES    Pit black olives, cut them very thin, and prepare as brain appetizer;  beat well with fork.      CHICKEN LIVER PASTE, No. 1    Wash thoroughly several fowls' livers and then let them simmer until  tender in a little strong soup stock, adding some sliced mushroom,  minced onion, and a little pepper and salt. When thoroughly done mince  the whole finely, or pound it in a mortar. Now put it back in the  saucepan and mix well with the yolks of sufficient eggs to make the  whole fairly moist. Warm over the fire, stirring frequently until the  mixture is quite thick, taking care that it does not burn.    It should be served upon rounds of toast on a hot dish garnished with  parsley.      IMITATION PATE DE FOI GRAS    Take as many livers and gizzards of any kind of fowl as you may have on  hand; add to these three tablespoons of chicken or goose fat, a finely  chopped onion, one tablespoon of pungent sauce, and salt and white  pepper to taste. Boil the livers until quite done and drain; when cold,  rub to a smooth paste. Take some of the fat and chopped onion and simmer  together slowly for ten minutes. Strain through a thin muslin bag,  pressing the bag tightly, turn into a bowl and mix with the seasoning;  work all together for a long time, then grease a bowl or cups and press  this mixture into them; when soft cut up the gizzards into bits and lay  between the mixture. You may season this highly, or to suit taste.      CHICKEN LIVER PASTE, No. 2    Take one-quarter pound chicken livers that have been boiled soft; drain  and rub through grater, add one-quarter cup of fresh mushrooms that have  been fried for three minutes in two tablespoons of chicken fat, chop  these, mix smooth with the liver, moistening with the fat used in frying  the mushrooms, season with salt, pepper, paprika and a little onion and  lemon juice. Spread on rye bread slices. Garnish plate with a red radish  or sprigs of parsley.      CHOPPED HERRING    Soak herring a few hours, when washed and cleaned, bone and chop. To one  herring take one onion, one sour apple, a slice of white bread which has  been soaked in vinegar, chop all these; add one teaspoon oil, a little  cinnamon and pepper. Put on platter in shape of a herring with head at  top and tail at bottom of dish, and sprinkle the chopped white of a  hard-boiled egg over fish and then the chopped yolk.      CHEESE BALLS    Take mashed cream cheese--add butter, cream and a little paprika. You  can chop either green peppers, almonds or olives in this mixture, or the  juice of an onion. Roll into small balls and serve on lettuce leaves.  This is also very good for sandwiches.      EGG APPETIZER    Boil eggs hard. Cut slice off the end, so that the egg will stand firm.  Dip egg in French dressing, then with a pastry bag arrange sardellen  butter on the top of egg. Have ready small squares of toasted bread,  spread with a thin layer of sardellen butter, on which to stand the  eggs. Caviar, mixed with some finely chopped onion, pepper and lemon  juice, may be used instead of the sardellen butter, but mayonnaise must  be used over the caviar.      DEVILED EGGS WITH HOT SAUCE    Take six hard-boiled eggs, cut lengthwise, remove yolk and add to same:  one dessertspoon of melted butter, Cayenne pepper, salt and chopped  parsley. Mash this mixture very fine and refill the whites of the eggs  and turn over on platter.    *Sauce.*--One tablespoon of butter, one tablespoon of flour, a pinch of  Cayenne pepper, salt and one pint of milk. Stir this mixture continually  until it thickens; beat the yolk of one egg and pour the hot gravy over  the same. Dress with chopped parsley and eat very hot. Sherry wine can  be added if desired.      STUFFED YELLOW TOMATOES    Take small yellow tomatoes, scrape out the centre and fill with caviar.  Serve on lettuce or watercress.      A DELICIOUS APPETIZER    Take as many slices of delicately browned toast as people to serve,  several large, firm tomatoes sliced, one green pepper, and store cheese.  Place a slice of tomato on each slice of toast and season with salt and  pepper and a dot of butter. Place several long, curly strips of pepper  around the tomato, and cover with a thin slice of the cheese. Place in  the oven until the cheese is melted. Serve piping hot.      CELERY RELISH    Boil about six pieces of celery root. When soft, peel and mash. Season  with salt, pepper, a little onion powder, a teaspoon of home-made  mustard and plenty of mayonnaise. Shape into pyramids, put mayonnaise on  the top of the pyramid, and on top of that either a little well-seasoned  caviar or some sardellen butter shaped in a pastry bag. Serve on a slice  of beets and a lettuce leaf.      SARDELLEN    Take one-quarter pound salted sardellen and soak in water over night.  Bone the next morning, put in cloth and press until dry; chop very fine,  almost to a paste; take one-half pound sweet butter, stir to a cream and  add the sardellen. Serve on toasted cracker or bread. Sprinkle with the  grated yellow and grated white of egg.      STUFFED EGGS    Hard boil eggs, drop into cold water, remove shells, cut each in half  lengthwise. Turn out yolks into a bowl. Carefully place whites together  in pairs, mash yolks with back of a spoon."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12351"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 07 (#2)"],[1,"writings of  his youth, Hegel became interested in various phases of movement and  change. The vicissitudes of his own inner or outer life he did not  analyze. He was not given to introspection. Romanticism and mysticism  were foreign to his nature. His temperament was rather that of the  objective thinker. Not his own passions, hopes, and fears, but those of  others invited his curiosity. With an humane attitude, the young Hegel  approached religious and historical problems. The dramatic life and  death of Jesus, the tragic fate of \"the glory that was Greece and the  grandeur that was Rome,\" the discrepancies between Christ's teachings  and the positive Christian religion, the fall of paganism and the  triumph of the Christian Church--these were the problems over which the  young Hegel pondered. Through an intense study of these problems, he  discovered that evil, sin, longing, and suffering are woven into the  very tissue of religious and historical processes, and that these  negative elements determine the very meaning and progress of history and  religion. Thereupon he began a systematic sketch of a philosophy in  which a negative factor was to be recognized as the positive vehicle in  the development of the whole world. And thus his genius came upon a  method which revealed to him an orderly unfolding in the world with  stages of relative values, the higher developing from the lower, and all  stages constituting an organic whole.    The method which the young Hegel discovered empirically, and which the  mature rationalist applied to every sphere of human life and thought, is  the famous Dialectical Method. This method is, in general, nothing else  than the recognition of the necessary presence of a negative factor in  the constitution of the world. Everything in the world--be it a  religious cult or a logical category, a human passion or a scientific  law--is, so Hegel holds, the result of a process which involves the  overcoming of a negative element. Without such an element to overcome,  the world would indeed be an inert and irrational affair. That any  rational and worthy activity entails the encounter of opposition and the  removal of obstacles is an observation commonplace enough. A  preestablished harmony of foreseen happy issues--a fool's paradise--is  scarcely our ideal of a rational world. Just as a game is not worth  playing when its result is predetermined by the great inferiority of the  opponent, so life without something negative to overcome loses its zest.  But the process of overcoming is not anything contingent; it operates  according to a uniform and universal law. And this law constitutes  Hegel's most central doctrine--his doctrine of Evolution.    In order to bring this doctrine into better relief, it may be well to  contrast it superficially with the Darwinian theory of transformation.  In general, Hegel's doctrine is a concept of value, Darwin's is not.  What Darwinians mean by evolution is not an unfolding of the past, a  progressive development of a hierarchy of phases, in which the later is  superior and organically related to the earlier. No sufficient criterion  is provided by them for evaluating the various stages in the course of  an evolutionary process. The biologist's world would probably have been  just as rational if the famous ape-like progenitor of man had chanced to  become his offspring-assuming an original environment favorable for such  transformation. Some criterion besides the mere external and accidental  \"struggle for existence\" and \"survival of the fittest\" must be furnished  to account for a progressive evolution. Does the phrase \"survival of the  fittest\" say much more than that those who happen to survive _are_ the  fittest, or that their survival proves their fitness? But that survival  itself is valuable: that it is better to be alive than dead; that  existence has a value other than itself; that what comes later in the  history of the race or of the universe is an advance over what went  before-that, in a word, the world is subject to an immanent development,  only a comprehensive and systematic philosophy can attempt to show.    The task of Hegel's whole philosophy consists in showing, by means of  one uniform principle, that the world manifests everywhere a genuine  evolution. Unlike the participants in the biological \"struggle for  existence,\" the struggling beings of Hegel's universe never end in  slaying, but in reconciliation. Their very struggle gives birth to a new  being which includes them, and this being is \"higher\" in the scale of  existence, because it represents the preservation of two mutually  opposed beings. Only where conflicts are adjusted, oppositions overcome,  negations removed, is there advance, in Hegel's sense; and only where  there is a passage from the positive through its challenging negative to  a higher form inclusive of both is there a case of real development.    The ordinary process of learning by experience illustrates somewhat  Hegel's meaning. An individual finds himself, for instance, in the  presence of a wholly new situation that elicits an immediate, definite  reaction. In his ignorance, he chooses the wrong mode of behavior. As a  consequence, trouble ensues; feelings are hurt, pride is wounded,  motives are misconstrued. Embittered and disappointed with himself, he  experiences great mental sorrow. But he soon learns to see the situation  in its true light; he condemns his deed and offers to make amends. And  after the wounds begin to heal again, the inner struggles experienced  commence to assume a positive worth. They have led him to a deeper  insight into his own motives, to a better self-comprehension. And he  finally comes forth from the whole affair enriched and enlightened. Now  in this formal example, to which any content may be supplied, three  phases can be distinguished. First, we have the person as he meant to be  in the presence of the new situation, unaware of trouble. Then, his  wrong reaction engendered a hostile element. He was at war with himself;  he was not what he meant to be. And finally, he returned to himself  richer and wiser, including within himself the negative experience as a  valuable asset in the advance of his development.    This process of falling away from oneself, of facing oneself as an enemy  whom one reconciles to and includes in one's larger self, is certainly  a familiar process. It is a process just like this that develops one's  personality. However the self may be defined metaphysically, it is for  every self-conscious individual a never-ceasing battle with conflicting  motives and antagonistic desires--a never-ending cycle of endeavor,  failure, and success through the very agency of failure.    A more typical instance of this rhythmic process is Hegel's view of the  evolution of religion. Religion, in general, is based on a dualism which  it seeks to overcome. Though God is in heaven and man on earth, religion  longs to bridge the gulf which separates man and God. The religions of  the Orient emphasize God's infinity. God is everything, man is nothing.  Like an Oriental prince, God is conceived to have despotic sway over  man, his creature. Only in contemplating God's omnipotence and his own  nothingness can man find solace and peace. Opposed to this religion of  the infinite is the finite religion of Greece.    Man in Greece stands in the centre of a beautiful cosmos which is not  alien to his spirit. The gods on high, conceived after the likeness of  man, are the expression of a free people conscious of their freedom. And  the divinities worshiped, under the form of Zeus, Apollo,  Aphrodite--what are they but idealized and glorified Greeks? Can a more  complete antithesis be imagined? But Christianity becomes possible after  this struggle only, for in Christianity is contained both the principle  of Oriental infinity and the element of Hellenic finitude, for in a  being who is both God and man--a God-man--the gulf between the infinite  and finite is bridged. The Christian, like the Greek, worships  man--Jesus; but this man is one with the eternal being of the Orient.  Because it is the outcome of the Oriental and Greek opposition, the  Christian religion is, in Hegel's sense, a higher one. Viewing the  Oriental and the Hellenic religions historically in terms of the  biological \"struggle for existence,\" the extinction of neither has  resulted. The Christian religion is the unity of these two struggling  opposites; in it they are conciliated and preserved. And this for Hegel  is genuine evolution.    That evolution demands a union of opposites seems at first paradoxical  enough. To say that Christianity is a religion of both infinity and  finitude means nothing less than that it contains a contradiction.  Hegel's view, strange as it may sound, is just this: everything includes  a contradiction in it, everything is both positive and negative,  everything expresses at once its Everlasting Yea and its Everlasting No.  The negative character of the world is the very vehicle of its progress.  Life and activity mean the triumph of the positive over the negative, a  triumph which results from absorbing and assimilating it. The myth of  the Phoenix typifies the life of reason \"eternally preparing for  itself,\" as Hegel says, \"a funeral pile, and consuming itself upon it;  but so that from its ashes it produces the new, renovated, fresh life.\"  That the power of negativity enters constitutively into the rationality  of the world, nay, that the rationality of the world demands negativity  in it, is Hegel's most original contribution to thought. His complete  philosophy is the attempt to show in detail that the whole universe and  everything it contains manifests the process of uniformly struggling  with a negative power, and is an outcome of conflicting, but reconciled  forces. An impressionistic picture of the world's eternal becoming  through this process is furnished"]]]
