Hajjaj choked the young life in its own       blood, and the Abbaside dynasty, with kingly patriotism, sold the       dearly-bought conquests of the nation, first to the Persians, and       then to Turkish slaves, with the view of procuring an imaginary       security for their throne. And thus there arose for the spiritual       life also a new period. Already Wackidi had begun to work up into       shape the mass of his traditionary stores, and busy himself in the       department of scholastic industry. In the schools one could as       little affect now the material tradition, or alter its nature, as       attempt to change the organism of the new-born child. However       arbitrary might be the invention of the 'Miraj' (Mahomed's heavenly       journey), and other fabrications of the first century, they still       formed in this way the positive element and soul of religious,       political and social life. The schools, as always, confined their       exertions to collecting, comparing, abbreviating, systematising,       and commenting. The material was altogether divine; and any       unprejudiced historical inquiry, any simple and natural       interpretation of the Coran, any free judgment on tradition or its       origin, was condemned as apostasy. The only task that remained was       to work up, in scholastic form, the existing material; and in this       way was developed a literature of boundless dimensions, which yet       at bottom possessed nothing real. The whole spiritual activity of       the Mohamedans, from the time of the prophet to the present day, is       a dream; but it is a dream in which a large portion of the human       race have lived; and it has all the interest which things relating       to mankind always possess for man.\"    Sir William Muir agrees with these views, subject to two  considerations. He says:--         \"The tendency to glorify Mohammed and the reciters of the       traditions was considerably modified by the mortal strife which       characterised the factions that opposed one another at the period,       where, in attempting to depreciate one another, they would not be       averse to perpetuating traditions in support of their contentions;       such partisanship secured no insignificant body of historical fact,       which otherwise would have been lost.\"    He also points out that in a state of society circumscribed and  dwarfed by the powerful Islamic system, which proscribed the free  exercise of thought and discussion, tradition can scarcely be said to  be the \"vox populi.\" The growth and development of tradition, the  flagrant distortion of historical fact, the ethical code of Islam, may  well give rise to a questioning of the validity of the prophet's  arrogant claims, and by their very methods of defence the apologists  of Islam exhibit its weakness and inadequacy to meet the religious  needs of man. The natural bias of Mohammed is evident throughout the  Coran. His conceptions of God, of the future life, and of the duty of  man, are all influenced by his consuming master passion. In all his  writings there are lacking those characteristics which distinguish the  true prophet--the messenger of God--from those to whom he is sent.  This will be apparent by contrasting his views with those of any of  the Old Testament prophets. They were eminently men prepared for their  high calling by lofty yet practical communion with God--men whose  message was inspired by a vision of Divine Majesty, and an impressive  conception of the justice and awful purity of Jehovah. Men who called  the nation to righteousness of life by a stirring appeal to  conscience, and an unfaltering denunciation of the evils of the time.  Their spiritual aspirations, therefore, by far surpass the loftiest  ideals of the prophet of Islam, while their ethical conceptions  infinitely transcend all that Mohammed dreamed of. The voice of the  Eternal is clearly heard in the earnest utterances that fell from  their lips, and through all their prophecies the willingness of Divine  Mercy to reason with men in spite of their erring ways, is apparent.    Three characteristic elements are perceived in their preaching--a very  keen and practical conscience of sin; an overpowering vision of God;  and a very sharp perception of the politics of their day. Of these  elements, Mohammed's teaching possesses only the last.        MOHAMMED'S CONCEPTION OF GOD      His conception of God is essentially deistical. The intimate personal  communion, so characteristic of the Old Testament, is unknown and  unrealised: hence there is little, if anything, in his system that  tends to draw men nigh to God. Attempts to remedy this characteristic  defect have been vainly made by the dervish orders, which, while  acknowledging the claims of Mohammed and his book, have introduced  methods not sanctioned by the system, by which they attempt to find  the communion with the Unseen, for which their souls crave. These  methods are very much akin to the efforts of the devotees of Hinduism.  There is, therefore, lacking amongst Moslems that need which grows out  of personal relationship with the Divine--that need which leads to  moral transformation and spiritual intensity on the part of those who  enjoy such fellowship. The Creator exists apart from His handiwork. He  has predetermined the actions of men. They are destined to eternal  bliss or destruction by an Inflexible Will, so that there is no need  for Divine Interference in their affairs. \"God is in His heaven, and  the world is working out its end according to His unalterable decree.\"    Because of this gross conception, Palgrave has designated the system  \"The Pantheism of Force,\" and says:         \"Immeasurably and eternally exalted above, and dissimilar from all       creatures, which he levelled before Him on one common plane of       instrumentality and inertness, God is One in the totality of       omnipotent and omnipresent action, which acknowledges no rule,       standard or limit, save His own sole and absolute will. He       communicates nothing to His creatures, for their seeming power and       act ever remain His alone, and in return He receives nothing from       them; for whatever they may be, that they are in Him, by Him, and       from Him only. And, secondly, no superiority, no distinction, no       pre-eminence, can be lawfully claimed by one creature ever its       fellow, in the utter equalisation of their unexceptional servitude       and abasement; all are alike tools of the one solitary Force which       employs them to crush or to benefit, to truth or to error, to       honour or shame, to happiness or misery, quite independently of       their individual fitness, deserts, or advantages, and simply       because 'He wills it,' and 'as He wills it ...'         \"One might at first sight think that this tremendous Autocrat, this       uncontrolled and unsympathising Power, would be far above anything       like passions, desires, or inclinations. Yet such is not the case,       for He has, with respect to His creatures, one main feeling and       source of action, namely, jealousy of them, lest they should       perchance attribute to themselves something of what is His alone,       and thus encroach on His all engrossing kingdom. Hence He is ever       more prone to punish than to reward; to inflict pain than to bestow       pleasure; to ruin than to build. It is His singular satisfaction to       let created beings continually feel that they are nothing else than       His slaves, His tools, and contemptible tools also; that thus they       may the better acknowledge His superiority, and know His power to       be above their power, His cunning above their cunning, His will       above their will, His pride above their pride--or, rather, that       there is no power, cunning, will, or pride save His own.         \"But He Himself, sterile in His inaccessible height, neither loving       nor enjoying aught save His own and self-measured decree, without       son, companion, or counsellor, is no less barren of Himself than       for His creatures, and His own barrenness and lone egoism in       Himself is the cause and rule of His indifferent and unregarding       despotism around. The first note is the key of the whole tune, and       the primal idea of God runs through and modifies the whole system       and creed that centres in Him.\"    Contrast this summary with the teaching of the Old Testament prophets,  the following quotations of which are but a small sample:--         \"Come, now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord. Though your       sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow; though they be       red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\"         \"Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God. Speak ye       comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her that her warfare is       accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned.\"         \"The spirit of the Lord God is upon me: because the Lord has       anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He hath sent me       to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,       and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, etc.\"         \"As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, saith       the Lord.\"         \"Who is a god like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth       by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth       not His anger for ever, because He delighteth in mercy. He will       turn again; He will have compassion upon us. He will subdue our       iniquities; and Thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the       sea.\"         \"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord       require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk       humbly with thy God.\"         \"The Lord is good, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14065"],[0,"The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard (#2)"],[1," to the former; he was  gone from a good and careful Patronage, and lay expos'd to, and comply'd  with the Temptations of the most wicked Wretches this Town could afford  as _Joseph Blake_, alias _Blewskins, William Field, Doleing, James  Sykes_, alias _Hell_ and _Fury_, which last was the first that betray'd,  and put him into the Hands of Justice, as will presently appear.    Having deserted his Master's Service, he took Shelter in the House of  Mr. _Charles_ in _May-Fair_, near _Piccadilly_, and his Landlord having  a Necessity for some Repairs in his House, engag'd one Mr. _Panton_ a  _Carpenter_ to Undertake them, and _Sheppard_ to assist him as a  Journeyman; but on the 23rd of _October_, 1723, e're the Work was  compleat, _Sheppard_ took Occasion to rob the People of the Effects  following, _viz._ seven Pound ten Shillings in Specie, five large silver  Spoons, six plain Forks ditto, four Tea-Spoons, six plain Gold Rings,  and a Cypher Ring; four Suits of Wearing Apparel, besides Linnen, to a  considerable value. This Fact he confess'd to the Reverend Mr.  _Wagstaff_ before his Escape from the Condemn'd Hold of _Newgate_.    _Sheppard_ had a Brother, nam'd _Thomas_, a _Carpenter_ by Profession,  tho' a notorious Thief and House-breaker by Practice. This _Thomas_  being committed to _Newgate_ for breaking the House of Mrs. _Mary Cook_  a _Linnen-Draper_, in _Clare-street, Clare-Market_, on the 5th of  _February_ last, and stealing Goods to the value of between 50, and 60  l. he impeach'd his Brother _John Sheppard_, and _Edgworth Bess_ as  being concerned with him in the Fact; and these three were also Charg'd  with being concern'd together, in breaking the House of Mr. _William  Phillips_ in _Drury-Lane_, and stealing divers Goods, the Property of  Mrs. _Kendrick_ a Lodger in the House, on the 14th of the said  _February_: All possible endeavours were us'd by Mrs. _Cook_ and Mr.  _Phillips_, to get _John Sheppard_ and _Edgworth Bess_ Apprehended, but  to no purpose, till the following Accident.    _Sheppard_ was now upon his wicked Range in _London_, committing  Robberies every where at Discretion; but one Day meeting with his  Acquaintance, _James Sykes_, alias _Hell_ and _Fury_, sometimes a  Chair-man, and at others a Running Foot-man. This _Sykes_ invited him to  go to one _Redgate's_, a Victualling-house near the _Seven Dials_, to  play at _Skettles_, _Sheppard_ comply'd, and _Sykes_ secretly sent for  Mr. _Price_ a Constable in St. _Giles's Parish_, and Charg'd him with  his Friend _Sheppard_ for the Robbing of Mrs. _Cook_, &c. _Sheppard_ was  carried before Justice _Parry_, who order'd him to St. _Giles's_  Round-house till the next Morning for farther Examination: He was  Confin'd in the Upper part of the Place, being two Stories from the  Ground, but 'ere two Hours came about, by only the help of a Razor, and  the Stretcher of a Chair, he broke open the Top of the Round house, and  tying together a Sheet and Blanket, by them descended into the  Church-yard and Escap'd, leaving the Parish to Repair the Damage, and  Repent of the Affront put upon his Skill and Capacity.    On the 19th of _May_ last in the Evening, _Sheppard_ with another Robber  named _Benson_, were passing thro' _Leicester-fields_, where a Gentleman  stood accusing a Woman with an attempt to steal his Watch, a Mobb was  gathered about the Disputants, and _Sheppard's_ Companion being a  _Master_, got in amongst them and pick'd the Gentleman's Pocket in good  earnest of the Watch; the Scene was surprizingly chang'd, from an  imaginary Robbery to a real one; and in a moment ensued an Out-cry of  _stop Thief_, _Sheppard_ and _Benson_ took to their Heels, and  _Sheppard_ was seiz'd by a Serjeant of the Guard at _Leicester_ House,  crying out _stop Thief_ with much earnestness. He was convey'd to St.  _Ann's Round House_ in _Soho_, and kept secure till the next Morning,  when _Edgworth Bess_ came to visit him, who was seiz'd also; they were  carried before Justice _Walters_, when the People in _Drury-Lane_ and  _Clare-Market_ appeared, and charged them with the Robberies  aforemention'd: But _Sheppard_ pretending to Impeach certain of his  Accomplices, the Justice committed them to _New-Prison_, with intent to  have them soon removed to _Newgate_, unless there came from them some  useful Discoveries. _Sheppard_ was now a second time in the hands of  Justice, but how long he intended to keep in them, the Reader will soon  be able to Judge.    He and his MATE were now in a strong and well guarded Prison, himself  loaded with a pair of double _Links_ and _Basils_[17] of about fourteen  pounds weight, and confined together in the safest Appartment call'd  _Newgate Ward_; _Sheppard_ conscious of his Crimes, and knowing the  _Information_ he had made to be but a blind Amusement that would avail  him nothing; he began to Meditate an Escape. They had been thus detained  for about four Days, and their Friends having the Liberty of seeing  them, furnish'd him with Implements proper for his Design, accordingly  Mr. _Sheppard_ goes to work, and on the 25th of May being _Whit-son  Monday_ at about two of the Clock in the Morning, he had compleated a  practicable breach, and sawed of his Fetters; having with unheard of  Diligence and Dexterity, cut off an Iron Bar from the Window, and taken  out a Muntin, or Bar of the most solid Oak of about nine Inches in  thickness, by boring it thro' in many Places, a work of great Skill and  Labour; they had still five and twenty Foot to descend from the Ground;  _Sheppard_ fasten'd a Sheet and Blanket to the Bars, and causes Madam to  take off her Gown and Petticoat, and sent her out first, and she being  more Corpulent than himself, it was with great Pain and Difficulty that  he got her through the Interval, and observing his Directions, was  instantly down, and more frighted than hurt; the _Phylosopher_ follow'd,  and lighted with Ease and Pleasure; But where are they Escap'd to? Why  out of one Prison into another. The Reader is to understand, that the  _New Prison_ and _Clerkenwell Bridewell_ lye Contiguous to one another,  and they are got into the Yard of the latter, and have a Wall of  twenty-two Foot high to Scale, before their Liberty is perfected;  _Sheppard_ far from being unprepared to surmount this Difficulty, has  his Gimblets and Peircers ready, and makes a Scaleing-Ladder. The  Keepers and Prisoners of both Places are a sleep in their Beds; he  Mounts his _Bagage_, and in less than ten Minutes carries both her and  himself over this wall, and compleats an entire Escape. Altho' his  Escape from the Condemn'd Hold of _Newgate_, has made a far greater  Noise in the World, than that from this Prison hath. It has been allow'd  by all the Jayl-Keepers in _London_, that one so Miraculous was never  perform'd before in _England_; the broken Chains and Bars are kept at  _New Prison_ to Testifie, and preserve the Memory of this extraordinary  Villain.    _Sheppard_ not warn'd by this Admonition, returns like a _Dog to his  Vomit_, and comes Secretly into his Master _Wood's_ Neighbourhood in  _Witch-street_, and conceits Measures with one _Anthony Lamb_, an  Apprentice to Mr. _Carter_ a Mathematical Instrument-maker, for Robbing  of Mr. _Barton_ a Master Taylor; a Man of Worth and Reputation, who  Lodg'd in Mr. _Carter's_ House. _Charles Grace_, a graceless Cooper was  let into the Secret, and consented, and resolved to Act his Part. The  16th of _June_ last was appointed, _Lamb_ accordingly lets _Grace_ and  _Sheppard_ into the House at Mid-Night; and they all go up to Mr.  _Bartons_ Appartment well arm'd with Pistols, and enter'd his Rooms,  without being disturb'd. _Grace_ was Posted at Mr. _Barton's_ Bedside  with a loaded Pistol, and positive Orders to shoot him through the Head,  if in case he awak'd. _Sheppard_ being engag'd in opening the Trunks and  Boxes, the mean while. It luckily happen'd for Mr. _Barton_, that he  slept Sounder than usual that Night, as having come from a Merry-making  with some Friends; tho' poor Man little Dreaming in what dreadful  Circumstances. They carried off in Notes, and Bonds, Guineas, Cloaths,  Made and Unmade, to the value of between two and three Hundred Pounds;  besides a Padesuoy Suit of Cloaths, worth about eighteen or twenty  Pounds more; which having been made for a Corpulent Gentleman,  _Sheppard_ had them reduc'd, and fitted for his own Size and War, as  designing to Appear and make a Figure among the _Beau Monde_. _Grace_  and _Sheppard_, having disposed of the Goods at an Ale-house in  _Lewkenors Lane_ (a Rendezvous of Robbers and Ruffians) took their  Flight, and _Grace_ had not been since heard of. _Lamb_ was apprehended,  and carried before Justice _Newton_, and made an ample Confession; and  there being nothing but that against him at his Tryal, and withal, a  favourable Prosecution, he came off with a Sentence of Transportation  only. He as well as _Sheppard_ has since confirm'd all the above  particulars, and with this Addition, _viz_. That it was Debated among  them to have Murder'd all the People in the House, save one Person.    About the latter End of the same Month, _June_, Mr. _Kneebone_, a  Woollen-Draper near the New Church in the _Strand_, receiv'd a Caution  from the Father of _Anthony Lamb_, who intimated to Mr. _Kneebone_ that  his House was intended to be broke open and robb'd that very Night. Mr.  _Kneebone_ prepar'd for the Event, ordering his Servants to sit up, and  gave Directions to the Watchman in the Street to observe his House: At  about two in the Morning _Sheppard_ and his Gang were about the Door, a  Maid-Servant went to listen, and heard one of the Wretches, say, _Da--n  him, if they could not enter that Night, they would another, and would  have 300l. of his_, (meaning) Mr. _Kneebone's_ Money. They went off, and  nothing more was heard of them till _Sunday_ the 12th Day of _July_  following, when _Joseph Blake_, alias"]]]
