It is their contrary action which keeps up the    harmony and equilibrium of the mundane machinery.\" (Michael    Sendivogius.)      \"Nature cannot work till it has been supplied with a material: the    first matter is furnished by God, the second matter by the sage.\"    (Michael Sendivogius.)      \"When corruptible elements are united in a certain substance,    their strife must sooner or later bring about its decomposition,    which is, of course, followed by putrefaction; in putrefaction,    the impure is separated from the pure; and if the pure elements    are then once more joined together by the action of natural heat,    a much nobler and higher form of life is produced.... If the    hidden central fire, which during life was in a state of    passivity, obtain the mastery, it attracts to itself all the pure    elements, which are thus separated from the impure, and form the    nucleus of a far purer form of life.\" (Michael Sendivogius.)      \"Cause that which is above to be below; that which is visible to    be invisible; that which is palpable to become impalpable. Again    let that which is below become that which is above; let the    invisible become visible, and the impalpable become palpable. Here    you see the perfection of our Art, without any defect or    diminution.\" (Basil Valentine, 15th century.)      \"Think most diligently about this; often bear in mind, observe and    comprehend, that all minerals and metals together, in the same    time, and after the same fashion, and of one and the same    principal matter, are produced and generated. That matter is no    other than a mere vapour, which is extracted from the elementary    earth by the superior stars, or by a sidereal distillation of the    macrocosm; which sidereal hot infusion, with an airy sulphurous    property, descending upon inferiors, so acts and operates as that    there is implanted, spiritually and invisibly, a certain power and    virtue in those metals and minerals; which fume, moreover,    resolves in the earth into a certain water, wherefrom all metals    are thenceforth generated and ripened to their perfection, and    thence proceeds this or that metal or mineral, according as one of    the three principles acquires dominion, and they have much or    little of sulphur and salt, or an unequal mixture of these; whence    some metals are fixed--that is, constant or stable; and some are    volatile and easily changeable, as is seen in gold, silver,    copper, iron, tin, and lead.\" (Basil Valentine.)      \"To grasp the invisible elements, to attract them by their    material correspondences, to control, purify, and transform them    by the living power of the Spirit--this is true Alchemy.\"    (Paracelsus.)      \"Destruction perfects that which is good; for the good cannot    appear on account of that which conceals it.... Each one of the    visible metals is a concealment of the other six metals.\"    (Paracelsus.)    These sayings read like sentences in a forgotten tongue.    Humboldt tells of a parrot which had lived with a tribe of American  Indians, and learnt scraps of their language; the tribe totally  disappeared; the parrot alone remained, and babbled words in the  language which no living human being could understand.    Are the words I have quoted unintelligible, like the parrot's prating?  Perhaps the language may be reconstructed; perhaps it may be found to  embody something worth a hearing. Success is most likely to come by  considering the growth of alchemy; by trying to find the ideas which  were expressed in the strange tongue; by endeavouring to look at our  surroundings as the alchemists looked at theirs.    Do what we will, we always, more or less, construct our own universe.  The history of science may be described as the history of the  attempts, and the failures, of men \"to see things as they are.\"  \"Nothing is harder,\" said the Latin poet Lucretius, \"than to separate  manifest facts from doubtful, what straightway the mind adds on of  itself.\"    Observations of the changes which are constantly happening in the sky,  and on the earth, must have prompted men long ago to ask whether there  are any limits to the changes of things around them. And this question  must have become more urgent as working in metals, making colours and  dyes, preparing new kinds of food and drink, producing substances with  smells and tastes unlike those of familiar objects, and other pursuits  like these, made men acquainted with transformations which seemed to  penetrate to the very foundations of things.    Can one thing be changed into any other thing; or, are there classes  of things within each of which change is possible, while the passage  from one class to another is not possible? Are all the varied  substances seen, tasted, handled, smelt, composed of a limited number  of essentially different things; or, is each fundamentally different  from every other substance? Such questions as these must have pressed  for answers long ago.    Some of the Greek philosophers who lived four or five hundred years  before Christ formed a theory of the transformations of matter, which  is essentially the theory held by naturalists to-day.    These philosophers taught that to understand nature we must get  beneath the superficial qualities of things. \"According to  convention,\" said Democritus (born 460 B.C.), \"there are a sweet and a  bitter, a hot and a cold, and according to convention there is  colour. In truth there are atoms and a void.\" Those investigators  attempted to connect all the differences which are observed between  the qualities of things with differences of size, shape, position, and  movement of atoms. They said that all things are formed by the  coalescence of certain unchangeable, indestructible, and impenetrable  particles which they named atoms; the total number of atoms is  constant; not one of them can be destroyed, nor can one be created;  when a substance ceases to exist and another is formed, the process is  not a destruction of matter, it is a re-arrangement of atoms.    Only fragments of the writings of the founders of the atomic theory  have come to us. The views of these philosophers are preserved, and  doubtless amplified and modified, in a Latin poem, _Concerning the  Nature of Things_, written by Lucretius, who was born a century before  the beginning of our era. Let us consider the picture given in that  poem of the material universe, and the method whereby the picture was  produced.[2]       [2] The quotations from Lucretius are taken from Munro's     translation (4th Edition, 1886).    All knowledge, said Lucretius, is based on \"the aspect and the law of  nature.\" True knowledge can be obtained only by the use of the senses;  there is no other method. \"From the senses first has proceeded the  knowledge of the true, and the senses cannot be refuted. Shall reason,  founded on false sense, be able to contradict [the senses], wholly  founded as it is on the senses? And if they are not true, then all  reason as well is rendered false.\" The first principle in nature is  asserted by Lucretius to be that \"Nothing is ever gotten out of  nothing.\" \"A thing never returns to nothing, but all things after  disruption go back to the first bodies of matter.\" If there were not  imperishable seeds of things, atoms, \"first-beginnings of solid  singleness,\" then, Lucretius urges, \"infinite time gone by and lapse  of days must have eaten up all things that are of mortal body.\"    The first-beginnings, or atoms, of things were thought of by Lucretius  as always moving; \"there is no lowest point in the sum of the  universe\" where they can rest; they meet, clash, rebound, or sometimes  join together into groups of atoms which move about as wholes. Change,  growth, decay, formation, disruption--these are the marks of all  things. \"The war of first-beginnings waged from eternity is carried on  with dubious issue: now here, now there, the life-bringing elements of  things get the mastery, and are o'ermastered in turn; with the funeral  wail blends the cry which babies raise when they enter the borders of  light; and no night ever followed day, nor morning night, that heard  not, mingling with the sickly infant's cries, the attendants' wailings  on death and black funeral.\"    Lucretius pictured the atoms of things as like the things perceived by  the senses; he said that atoms of different kinds have different  shapes, but the number of shapes is finite, because there is a limit  to the number of different things we see, smell, taste, and handle; he  implies, although I do not think he definitely asserts, that all atoms  of one kind are identical in every respect.    We now know that many compounds exist which are formed by the union of  the same quantities by weight of the same elements, and, nevertheless,  differ in properties; modern chemistry explains this fact by saying  that the properties of a substance depend, not only on the kind of  atoms which compose the minute particles of a compound, and the number  of atoms of each kind, but also on the mode of arrangement of the  atoms.[3] The same doctrine was taught by Lucretius, two thousand  years ago. \"It often makes a great difference,\" he said, \"with what  things, and in what positions the same first-beginnings are held in  union, and what motions they mutually impart and receive.\" For  instance, certain atoms may be so arranged at one time as to produce  fire, and, at another time, the arrangement of the same atoms may be  such that the result is a fir-tree. The differences between the  colours of things are said by Lucretius to be due to differences in  the arrangements and motions of atoms. As the colour of the sea when  wind lashes it into foam is different from the colour when the waters  are at rest, so do the colours of things change when the atoms whereof  the things are composed change from one arrangement to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#2)"],[1,"p, but neither of them was  more successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse  met its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went  back to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever the despot of the region.    Next year, two other hunters appeared, determined to win the promised  bounty. Each believed he could destroy this noted wolf, the first by  means of a newly devised poison, which was to be laid out in an entirely  new manner; the other a French Canadian, by poison assisted with certain  spells and charms, for he firmly believed that Lobo was a veritable  'loup-garou,' and could not be killed by ordinary means. But cunningly  compounded poisons, charms, and incantations were all of no avail  against this grizzly devastator. He made his weekly rounds and daily  banquets as aforetime, and before many weeks had passed, Calone and  Laloche gave up in despair and went elsewhere to hunt.    In the spring of 1893, after his unsuccessful attempt to capture Lobo,  Joe Calone had a humiliating experience, which seems to show that the  big wolf simply scorned his enemies, and had absolute confidence in  himself. Calone's farm was on a small tributary of the Currumpaw, in a  picturesque canon, and among the rocks of this very canon, within a  thousand yards of the house, old Lobo and his mate selected their den  and raised their family that season. There they lived all summer, and  killed Joe's cattle, sheep, and dogs, but laughed at all his poisons and  traps, and rested securely among the recesses of the cavernous cliffs,  while Joe vainly racked his brain for some method of smoking them out,  or of reaching them with dynamite. But they escaped entirely unscathed,  and continued their ravages as before. \"There's where he lived all last  summer,\" said Joe, pointing to the face of the cliff, \"and I couldn't do  a thing with him. I was like a fool to him.\"          II      This history, gathered so far from the cowboys, I found hard to believe  until, in the fall of 1893, I made the acquaintance of the wily  marauder, and at length came to know him more thoroughly than anyone  else. Some years before, in the Bingo days, I had been a wolf-hunter,  but my occupations since then had been of another sort, chaining me to  stool and desk. I was much in need of a change, and when a friend, who  was also a ranch-owner on the Currumpaw, asked me to come to New Mexico  and try if I could do anything with this predatory pack, I accepted the  invitation and, eager to make the acquaintance of its king, was as soon  as possible among the mesas of that region. I spent some time riding  about to learn the country, and at intervals, my guide would point to  the skeleton of a cow to which the hide still adhered, and remark,  \"That's some of his work.\"    It became quite clear to me that, in this rough country, it was useless  to think of pursuing Lobo with hounds and horses, so that poison or  traps were the only available expedients. At present we had no traps  large enough, so I set to work with poison.    I need not enter into the details of a hundred devices that I employed  to circumvent this 'loup-garou'; there was no combination of strychnine,  arsenic, cyanide, or prussic acid, that I did not essay; there was no  manner of flesh that I did not try as bait; but morning after morning,  as I rode forth to learn the result, I found that all my efforts had  been useless. The old king was too cunning for me. A single instance  will show his wonderful sagacity. Acting on the hint of an old trapper,  I melted some cheese together with the kidney fat of a freshly killed  heifer, stewing it in a china dish, and cutting it with a bone knife to  avoid the taint of metal. When the mixture was cool, I cut it into  lumps, and making a hole in one side of each lump, I inserted a large  dose of strychnine and cyanide, contained in a capsule that was  impermeable by any odor; finally I sealed the holes up with pieces of  the cheese itself. During the whole process, I wore a pair of gloves  steeped in the hot blood of the heifer, and even avoided breathing on  the baits. When all was ready, I put them in a raw-hide bag rubbed all  over with blood, and rode forth dragging the liver and kidneys of the  beef at the end of a rope. With this I made a ten-mile circuit, dropping  a bait at each quarter of a mile, and taking the utmost care, always,  not to touch any with my hands.    Lobo, generally, came into this part of the range in the early part of  each week, and passed the latter part, it was supposed, around the base  of Sierra Grande. This was Monday, and that same evening, as we were  about to retire, I heard the deep bass howl of his majesty. On hearing  it one of the boys briefly remarked, \"There he is, we'll see.\"    The next morning I went forth, eager to know the result. I soon came on  the fresh trail of the robbers, with Lobo in the lead--his track was  always easily distinguished. An ordinary wolf's forefoot is 4-1/2 inches  long, that of a large wolf 4-3/4 inches, but Lobo's, as measured a  number of times, was 5-1/2 inches from claw to heel; I afterward found  that his other proportions were commensurate, for he stood three feet  high at the shoulder, and weighed 150 pounds. His trail, therefore,  though obscured by those of his followers, was never difficult to trace.  The pack had soon found the track of my drag, and as usual followed it.  I could see that Lobo had come to the first bait, sniffed about it, and  had finally picked it up.    Then I could not conceal my delight. \"I've got him at last,\" I  exclaimed; \"I shall find him stark within a mile,\" and I galloped on  with eager eyes fixed on the great broad track in the dust. It led me to  the second bait and that also was gone. How I exulted--I surely have him  now and perhaps several of his band. But there was the broad paw-mark  still on the drag; and though I stood in the stirrup and scanned the  plain I saw nothing that looked like a dead wolf. Again I followed--to  find now that the third bait was gone--and the king-wolf's track led on  to the fourth, there to learn that he had not really taken a bait at  all, but had merely carried them in his mouth. Then having piled the  three on the fourth, he scattered filth over them to express his utter  contempt for my devices. After this he left my drag and went about his  business with the pack he guarded so effectively.    This is only one of many similar experiences which convinced me that  poison would never avail to destroy this robber, and though I continued  to use it while awaiting the arrival of the traps, it was only because  it was meanwhile a sure means of killing many prairie wolves and other  destructive vermin.    About this time there came under my observation an incident that will  illustrate Lobo's diabolic cunning. These wolves had at least one  pursuit which was merely an amusement, it was stampeding and killing  sheep, though they rarely ate them. The sheep are usually kept in flocks  of from one thousand to three thousand under one or more shepherds. At  night they are gathered in the most sheltered place available, and a  herdsman sleeps on each side of the flock to give additional protection.  Sheep are such senseless creatures that they are liable to be stampeded  by the veriest trifle, but they have deeply ingrained in their nature  one, and perhaps only one, strong weakness, namely, to follow their  leader. And this the shepherds turn to good account by putting half a  dozen goats in the flock of sheep. The latter recognize the superior  intelligence of their bearded cousins, and when a night alarm occurs  they crowd around them, and usually, are thus saved from a stampede and  are easily protected. But it was not always so. One night late in last  November, two Perico shepherds were aroused by an onset of wolves. Their  flocks huddled around the goats, which being neither fools nor cowards,  stood their ground and were bravely defiant; but alas for them, no  common wolf was heading this attack. Old Lobo, the weir-wolf, knew as  well as the shepherds that the goats were the moral force of the flock,  so hastily running over the backs of the densely packed sheep, he fell  on these leaders, slew them all in a few minutes, and soon had the  luckless sheep stampeding in a thousand different directions. For weeks  afterward I was almost daily accosted by some anxious shepherd, who  asked, \"Have you seen any stray OTO sheep lately?\" and usually I was  obliged to say I had; one day it was, \"Yes, I came on some five or six  carcasses by Diamond Springs;\" or another, it was to the effect that I  had seen a small 'bunch' running on the Malpai Mesa; or again, \"No, but  Juan Meira saw about twenty, freshly killed, on the Cedra Monte two days  ago.\"    At length the wolf traps arrived, and with two men I worked a whole week  to get them properly set out. We spared no labor or pains, I adopted  every device I could think of that might help to insure success. The  second day after the traps arrived, I rode around to inspect, and soon  came upon Lobo's trail running from trap to trap. In the dust I could  read the whole story of his doings that night. He had trotted along in  the darkness, and although the traps were so carefully concealed, he had  instantly detected the first one. Stopping the onward march of the pack,  he had cautiously scratched around it until he had disclosed the trap,  the chain, and the log, then left them wholly exposed to view with the  trap still unsprung, and passing on he treated over a dozen traps in the  same fashion. Very soon I noticed that he stopped and turned aside as  soon as he detected suspicious signs on the trail, and a new plan to  outwit him at once suggested itself. I set the traps in the form of an  H; that is, with a row of traps on each side of the trail, and one on  the trail for the cross-bar of the H. Before long, I had an opportunity "]]]
