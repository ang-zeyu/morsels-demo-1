What bitter pangs my bosom rent,    When he my sight no longer bless'd!  To some lone spot my steps I bent,    My secret sorrows there confess'd.    My sighs, alas! were breath'd unheard,    Could aught on earth dispel my grief?  Nor smiling sun, nor minstrel bird,    Can give this aching heart relief.

And so here we are, once again on tiptoe for a merry Christmas and a  happy new year. My good friends, especially my fair friends, permit me  to wish you both. Yes, Christmas is here--Christmas, when winter and  jollity, foul weather and fun, cold winds and hot pudding, good frosts  and good fires, are at their meridian! Christmas! With what dear  associations is it fraught! I remember the time when I thought that word  cabalistical; when, in the gay moments of youth, it seemed to me a  mysterious term for every thing that is delightful; and such is the  force of early associations, that even now I cannot divest myself of  them. Christmas has long ceased to be to me what it once was; yet do I  even now hail its return with pleasure, with enthusiasm. But, alas! how  differently is it viewed, not only by the same individual at different  periods of life, but by different individuals of the same age; by the  rich and poor, the wretched and the happy, the pampered and the  penniless!    To proceed to the object of this paper, which is simply to throw  together a few casual hints, connected with the period. I would beg my  reader's attention, in the first place, to an odd superstition,  countenanced by Shakspeare, and which, if he happens to lie awake some  night, (say with the tooth-ache--what better?--for that purpose I mean,)  he will have an opportunity of verifying. The passage which contains it  is in _Hamlet_ and exhibits at once his usual wildness of imagination,  and a highly praiseworthy religious veneration for the season. Where the  ghost vanishes upon the crowing of the cock, he takes occasion to  mention its crowing all hours of the night about Christmas time. The  last four lines comprise several other superstitions connected with the  period:--    It faded on the crowing of the cock.  Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes,  Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,  The bird of dawning singeth all night long.  And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad:  The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike;  No fairy takes; no witch hath power to charm;  So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.      It is to be lamented that the hearty diet, properly belonging to the  season, should have become almost peculiar to it; the _Tatler_  recommends it throughout the year. \"I shall begin,\" says Steele, \"with a  very earnest and serious exhortation to all my well-disposed readers,  that they would return to the food of their forefathers, and reconcile  themselves to beef and mutton. This was the diet which bred that hardy  race of mortals who won the fields of Cressy and Agincourt. I need not  go so high up as the history of Guy, earl of Warwick, who is well known  to have eaten up a dun cow of his own killing. The renowned king Arthur  is generally looked upon as the first who ever sat down to a whole  roasted ox, which was certainly the best way to preserve the gravy; and  it is farther added, that he and his knights sat about it at his round  table, and usually consumed it to the very bones before they would enter  upon any debate of moment. The Black Prince was a professed lover of the  brisket; not to mention the history of the sirloin, or the institution  of the order of Beefeaters, which are all so many evident and undeniable  proofs of the great respect which our warlike predecessors have paid to  this excellent food. The tables of the ancient entry of this nation were  covered thrice a day with hot roast-beef; and I am credibly informed by  an antiquary, who has searched the registers in which the bills of fare  of the court are recorded, that instead of tea and bread and butter  which have prevailed of late years, the maids of honour in queen  Elizabeth's time were allowed three rumps of beef for their breakfast!\"    Now this is manly, and so is the diet it advises; I recommend both to my  readers. Let each determine to make one convert, himself that one. On  Christmas day, let each dine off, or at least have on his table, the  good old English fare, roast beef and plum-pudding! and does such beef  as our island produces need recommendation? What more nutritive and  delicious? and, for a genuine healthy Englishman, what more proper than  this good old national English dish? Let him whose stomach will not bear  it, look about and insure his life--I would not give much for it. It  ought, above all other places, to be duly honoured in our officers'  mess-rooms. As Prior says,      \"If I take Dan Congreve right,  Pudding and beef make Britons fight.\"      So, then, if beef be indeed so excellent,  we shall not much wonder that Shakspeare  should say,      --\"A pound of man's flesh  Is not so estimable or profitable.  As flesh of mutton, beeves, or goats!\"      The French have christened us (and I think it no disreputable  _sobriquet_) Jack Roastbeef, from a notion we cannot live without  roast-beef, any more than without plum-pudding, porter, and punch;  however, the notion is palpably erroneous. We are proving more and more  every day--to our shame be it spoken!--that we can live without it. At  least do not let it be said we can pass a Christmas without it, merely  to make way for turkeys, fricassees, and ragouts! \"Oh, reform it  altogether!\"           *       *       *       *       *    England was always famous among foreigners for the celebration of  Christmas, at which time our ancestors introduced many sports and  pastimes unknown in other countries, or now even among ourselves. \"At  the feast of Christmas,\" says Stowe, \"in the king's court, wherever he  chanced to reside, there was appointed a lord of misrule, or master of  merry disports; the same merry fellow made his appearance at the house  of every nobleman and gentleman of distinction; and, among the rest, the  lord mayor of London and the sheriffs had their lords of misrule, ever  contending, without quarrel or offence, who should make the rarest  pastime to delight the beholders.\" Alas! where are all these, or any  similar, \"merry disports\" in our degenerate days? We have no \"lords of  misrule\" now; or, if we have, they are of a much less innocent and  pacific character. Mr. Cambridge, also, (No 104, of the _World_) draws a  glowing picture of an ancient Christmas. \"Our ancestors,\" says he,  \"considered Christmas in the double light of a holy commemoration and a  cheerful festival; and accordingly distinguished it by devotion, by  vacation from business, by merriment and hospitality. They seemed  eagerly bent to make themselves and every body about them happy. With  what punctual zeal did they wish one another a merry Christmas! and what  an omission would it have been thought, to have concluded a letter  without the compliments of the season! The great hall resounded with the  tumultuous joys of servants and tenants, and the gambols they played  served as an amusement to the lord of the mansion and his family, who,  by encouraging every art that conduced to mirth and entertainment,  endeavoured to soften the rigour of the season, and to mitigate the  influence of winter. How greatly ought we to regret the neglect of  mince-pies, which, besides the idea of merry-making inseparable from  them, were always considered as the test of schismatics! How zealously  were they swallowed by the orthodox, to the utter confusion of all  fanatical recusants! If any country gentleman should be so unfortunate  in this age as to lie under a suspicion of heresy, where will he find so  easy a method of acquitting himself as by the ordeal of plum-porridge?\"  This alludes to the Puritans, who refused to observe Christmas, or any  other festival of the church, either by devotion or merriment. And I  regret to say there are certain modern \"fanatical recusants,\" certain  modern Puritans, as schismatical in this particular as their gloomy  precursors. Mr. Cambridge then proceeds \"to account for a revolution  which has rendered this season (so eminently distinguished in former  times) now so little different from the rest of the year,\" which he  thinks \"no difficult task.\" The reasons he assigns are, the decline of  devotion, and the increase of luxury, the latter of which has extended  rejoicings and feastings, formerly peculiar to Christmas, through the  whole year; these have consequently lost their raciness, the appetite  for amusement has become palled by satiety, and the relish for it,  reserved formerly for this particular season, is now no longer peculiar  to it, having been already dissipated and exhausted. Another cause he  assigns is, \"the too general desertion of the country, the great scene  of hospitality.\" Now this was written just fifty-three years ago, and as  all the causes assigned for the declension of this grand national  festivity up to that period are incontrovertible, and have been  operating even more powerfully ever since, they will sufficiently  account for the still greater declension observable in our days. And the  declension appears to me to consist in this,--there is more gastronomy  and expanse, but less"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11384"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

No. CXI.      THE MUTINY.        ----O God!    Had you but seen his pale, pale blanched cheek!    He would not eat.--O Christ!      THE BERYL.    In the summer of the year 18--, I was the only passenger on board the  merchantman, Alceste, which was bound to the Brazils. One fine  moonlight night, I stood on the deck, and gazed on the quiet ocean, on  which the moon-beams danced. The wind was so still, that it scarcely  agitated the sails, which were spread out to invite it. I looked  round; it was the same on every side--a world of waters: not a single  object diversified the view, or intercepted the long and steady glance  which I threw over the ocean. I have heard many complain of the  sameness and unvarying uniformity of the objects which oppose  themselves to the eye of the voyager. I feel differently; I can gaze  for hours, without weariness, on the deep, occupied with the thought  it produces; I can listen to the rush of the element as the vessel  cleaves it, and these things have charms for me which others cannot  perceive.    I heard, on a sudden, a noise, which seemed to proceed from the  captain's cabin, and I thought I could distinguish the voices of  several men, speaking earnestly, though in a suppressed tone. I  cautiously drew near the spot from whence the noise arose, but the  alarm was given, and I could see no one. I retired to rest, or rather  to lie down; for I felt that heavy and foreboding sense of evil  overpower me, which comes we know not how or wherefore; and I could  not sleep, knowing that there had been disputes between the captain  and his men, respecting some point of discipline, and I feared to  think what might be the consequences. I lay a long time disturbed with  these unpleasant reflections; at last, wearied with my thoughts, my  eyes closed, and I dropped to sleep. But it was not to that refreshing  sleep which recruits the exhausted spirits, and by awhile \"steeping  the senses in forgetfulness,\" renders them fitter for exertion on  awakening. My sleep was haunted with hideous and confused dreams, and  murder and blood seemed to surround me. I was awakened by convulsive  starts, and in vain sought again for quiet slumber; the same images  filled my mind, diversified in a thousand horrid forms. Early in the  morning, I arose, and went above, and the mild sea breeze dispelled my  uneasy sensations.    During the whole of the day nothing seemed to justify the fears that  had tormented me, and everything went on in its regular course. The  men pursued their occupations quietly and in silence, and I thought  the temporary fit of disaffection was passed over. Alas! I remembered  not that the passions of men, like deep waters, are most to be  suspected when they seem to glide along most smoothly. Night came on,  and I retired to rest more composed than on the preceding evening. I  endeavoured to convince myself that the noises I had heard were but  the fancies of a disturbed imagination, and I slept soundly. Ill-timed  security! About midnight I was awakened by a scuffling in the vessel.  I hastened to the spot; the captain and one of his officers were  fighting against a multitude of the ship's crew. In a moment after I  saw the officer fall. Two fellows advanced to me, and, clapping  pistols to my breast, threatened instant death, if I stirred or spoke.  I gazed on the bloody spectacle; the bodies, which lay around,  swimming in gore, testified that the mutineers could not have  accomplished their aim with impunity. I was horror-struck; a swimming  sensation came over my eyes, my limbs failed me, and I fell senseless.    When I recovered, I found myself lying on a bed. Everything was still.  I listened in vain for a sound; I lay still a considerable time; at  last, I arose and walked about the ship, but could see no one. I  searched every part of the vessel; I visited the place of slaughter,  which I had, at first, carefully avoided; I counted nine dead bodies,  and the coagulated blood formed a loathsome mass around them; I  shuddered to think I was desolate--the companion of death. \"Good God!\"  said I, \"and they have left me here alone!\" The word sounded like a  knell to me. It now occurred to me, it was necessary the bodies should  be thrown overboard. I took up one of them, dragged it to the side,  and plunged it into the waves; but the dash of the heavy body into the  sea, reminded me more forcibly of my loneliness. The sea was so calm,  I could scarcely hear it ripple by the vessel's side. One by one I  committed the bodies to their watery grave. At last my horrible task  was finished. My next work was to look for the ship's boats, but they  were gone, as I expected. I could not bear to remain in the ship; it  seemed a vast tomb for me. I resolved to make some sort of raft, and  depart in it. This occupied two or three days; at length it was  completed, and I succeeded in setting it afloat.    I lowered into it all the provision I could find in the ship, which  was but little, the sailors having, as I imagined, carried off the  remainder. All was ready, and I prepared to depart. I trembled at the  thought of the dangers I was about to encounter. I was going to commit  myself to the ocean, separated from it only by a few boards, which a  wave might scatter over the surface of the waters. I might never  arrive at land, or meet with any vessel to rescue me from my danger,  and I should be exposed, without shelter, and almost without food. I  half resolved to remain in my present situation; but a moment's  reflection dispelled the idea of such a measure. I descended; I stood  on my frail raft; I cut the rope by which it was fastened to the ship.  I was confused to think of my situation; I could hardly believe that I  had dared to enter alone on the waste of waters. I endeavoured to  compose myself, but in vain. As far as I could see, nothing presented  itself to my view but the vessel I had left; the sea was perfectly  still, for not the least wind was stirring. I endeavoured, with two  pieces of board, which supplied the place of oars, to row myself  along; but the very little progress I made alarmed me. If the calm  should continue, I should perish of hunger. How I longed to see the  little sail I had made, agitated by the breeze! I watched it from  morning to night; it was my only employment; but in vain. The weather  continued the same. Two days passed over; I looked at my store of  provisions; it would not, I found, last above three or four days  longer, at the farthest. They were quickly passing away. I almost gave  myself up for lost. I had scarcely a hope of escaping.    On the fourth day since my departure from the ship, I thought I  perceived something at a distance; I looked at it intently--it was a  sail. Good heavens! what were my emotions at the sight! I fastened my  handkerchief on a piece of wood, and waved it, in hopes that it would  be observed, and that I should be rescued from my fearful condition.  The vessel pressed on its course; I shouted;--I knew they could not  hear me, but despair impelled me to try so useless an expedient. It  passed on--it grew dim--I stretched my eyeballs to see it--it  vanished--it was gone! I will not attempt to describe the torturing  feelings which possessed me, at seeing the chance of relief which had  offered itself destroyed. I was stupified with grief and  disappointment. My stock of provisions was now entirely exhausted, and  I looked forward with horror to an"]]]
