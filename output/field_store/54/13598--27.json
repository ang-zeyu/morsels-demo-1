She was grasping the truth,  when suddenly there came, in inward constriction, a hardening of gentle  forces within her breast. Like a steel bar it was stiffening all that  had been soft and weak in her. She felt a birth in her of something new  and unintelligible. Once more her strained gaze sought the sage-slopes.  Jane Withersteen loved that wild and purple wilderness. In times  of sorrow it had been her strength, in happiness its beauty was her  continual delight. In her extremity she found herself murmuring, \"Whence  cometh my help!\" It was a prayer, as if forth from those lonely purple  reaches and walls of red and clefts of blue might ride a fearless man,  neither creed-bound nor creed-mad, who would hold up a restraining hand  in the faces of her ruthless people.    The restless movements of Tull's men suddenly quieted down. Then  followed a low whisper, a rustle, a sharp exclamation.    \"Look!\" said one, pointing to the west.    \"A rider!\"    Jane Withersteen wheeled and saw a horseman, silhouetted against the  western sky, coming riding out of the sage. He had ridden down from the  left, in the golden glare of the sun, and had been unobserved till close  at hand. An answer to her prayer!    \"Do you know him? Does any one know him?\" questioned Tull, hurriedly.    His men looked and looked, and one by one shook their heads.    \"He's come from far,\" said one.    \"Thet's a fine hoss,\" said another.    \"A strange rider.\"    \"Huh! he wears black leather,\" added a fourth.    With a wave of his hand, enjoining silence, Tull stepped forward in such  a way that he concealed Venters.    The rider reined in his mount, and with a lithe forward-slipping  action appeared to reach the ground in one long step. It was a peculiar  movement in its quickness and inasmuch that while performing it the  rider did not swerve in the slightest from a square front to the group  before him.    \"Look!\" hoarsely whispered one of Tull's companions. \"He packs two  black-butted guns--low down--they're hard to see--black akin them black  chaps.\"    \"A gun-man!\" whispered another. \"Fellers, careful now about movin' your  hands.\"    The stranger's slow approach might have been a mere leisurely manner of  gait or the cramped short steps of a rider unused to walking; yet, as  well, it could have been the guarded advance of one who took no chances  with men.    \"Hello, stranger!\" called Tull. No welcome was in this greeting only a  gruff curiosity.    The rider responded with a curt nod. The wide brim of a black sombrero  cast a dark shade over his face. For a moment he closely regarded Tull  and his comrades, and then, halting in his slow walk, he seemed to  relax.    \"Evenin', ma'am,\" he said to Jane, and removed his sombrero with quaint  grace.    Jane, greeting him, looked up into a face that she trusted instinctively  and which riveted her attention. It had all the characteristics of  the range rider's--the leanness, the red burn of the sun, and the set  changelessness that came from years of silence and solitude. But it was  not these which held her, rather the intensity of his gaze, a strained  weariness, a piercing wistfulness of keen, gray sight, as if the man  was forever looking for that which he never found. Jane's subtle woman's  intuition, even in that brief instant, felt a sadness, a hungering, a  secret.    \"Jane Withersteen, ma'am?\" he inquired.    \"Yes,\" she replied.    \"The water here is yours?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"May I water my horse?\"    \"Certainly. There's the trough.\"    \"But mebbe if you knew who I was--\" He hesitated, with his glance on  the listening men. \"Mebbe you wouldn't let me water him--though I ain't  askin' none for myself.\"    \"Stranger, it doesn't matter who you are. Water your horse. And if you  are thirsty and hungry come into my house.\"    \"Thanks, ma'am. I can't accept for myself--but for my tired horse--\"    Trampling of hoofs interrupted the rider. More restless movements on  the part of Tull's men broke up the little circle, exposing the prisoner  Venters.    \"Mebbe I've kind of hindered somethin'--for a few moments, perhaps?\"  inquired the rider.    \"Yes,\" replied Jane Withersteen, with a throb in her voice.    She felt the drawing power of his eyes; and then she saw him look at the  bound Venters, and at the men who held him, and their leader.    \"In this here country all the rustlers an' thieves an' cut-throats  an' gun-throwers an' all-round no-good men jest happen to be Gentiles.  Ma'am, which of the no-good class does that young feller belong to?\"    \"He belongs to none of them. He's an honest boy.\"    \"You KNOW that, ma'am?\"    \"Yes--yes.\"    \"Then what has he done to get tied up that way?\"    His clear and distinct question, meant for Tull as well as for Jane  Withersteen, stilled the restlessness and brought a momentary silence.    \"Ask him,\" replied Jane, her voice rising high.    The rider stepped away from her, moving out with the same slow, measured  stride in which he had approached, and the fact that his action placed  her wholly to one side, and him no nearer to Tull and his men, had a  penetrating significance.    \"Young feller, speak up,\" he said to Venters.    \"Here stranger, this's none of your mix,\" began Tull. \"Don't try any  interference. You've been asked to drink and eat. That's more than you'd  have got in any other village of the Utah border. Water your horse and  be on your way.\"    \"Easy--easy--I ain't interferin' yet,\" replied the rider. The tone of  his voice had undergone a change. A different man had spoken. Where, in  addressing Jane, he had been mild and gentle, now, with his first speech  to Tull, he was dry, cool, biting. \"I've lest stumbled onto a queer  deal. Seven Mormons all packin' guns, an' a Gentile tied with a rope,  an' a woman who swears by his honesty! Queer, ain't that?\"    \"Queer or not, it's none of your business,\" retorted Tull.    \"Where I was raised a woman's word was law. I ain't quite outgrowed that  yet.\"    Tull fumed between amaze and anger.    \"Meddler, we have a law here something different from woman's  whim--Mormon law!... Take care you don't transgress it.\"    \"To hell with your Mormon law!\"    The deliberate speech marked the rider's further change, this time from  kindly interest to an awakening menace. It produced a transformation in  Tull and his companions. The leader gasped and staggered backward at  a blasphemous affront to an institution he held most sacred. The man  Jerry, holding the horses, dropped the bridles and froze in his tracks.  Like posts the other men stood watchful-eyed, arms hanging rigid, all  waiting.    \"Speak up now, young man. What have you done to be roped that way?\"    \"It's a damned outrage!\" burst out Venters. \"I've done no wrong. I've  offended this Mormon Elder by being a friend to that woman.\"    \"Ma'am, is it true--what he says?\" asked the rider of Jane, but his  quiveringly alert eyes never left the little knot of quiet men.    \"True? Yes, perfectly true,\" she answered.    \"Well, young man, it seems to me that bein' a friend to such a woman  would be what you wouldn't want to help an' couldn't help.... What's to  be done to you for it?\"    \"They intend to whip me. You know what that means--in Utah!\"    \"I reckon,\" replied the rider, slowly.    With his gray glance cold on the Mormons, with the restive bit-champing  of the horses, with Jane failing to repress her mounting agitations,  with Venters standing pale and still, the tension of the moment  tightened. Tull broke the spell with a laugh, a laugh without mirth, a  laugh that was only a sound betraying fear.    \"Come on, men!\" he called.    Jane Withersteen turned again to the rider.    \"Stranger, can you do nothing to save Venters?\"    \"Ma'am, you ask me to save him--from your own people?\"    \"Ask you? I beg of you!\"    \"But you don't dream who you're askin'.\"    \"Oh, sir, I pray you--save him!\"    \"These are Mormons, an' I...\"    \"At--at any cost--save him. For I--I care for him!\"    Tull snarled. \"You love-sick fool! Tell your secrets. There'll be a way  to teach you what you've never learned.... Come men out of here!\"    \"Mormon, the young man stays,\" said the rider.    Like a shot his voice halted Tull.    \"What!\"    \"Who'll keep him? He's my prisoner!\" cried Tull, hotly. \"Stranger, again  I tell you--don't mix here. You've meddled enough. Go your way now or--\"    \"Listen!... He stays.\"    Absolute certainty, beyond any shadow of doubt, breathed in the rider's  low voice.    \"Who are you? We are seven here.\"    The rider dropped his sombrero and made a rapid movement, singular in  that it left him somewhat crouched, arms bent and stiff, with the big  black gun-sheaths swung round to the fore.    \"LASSITER!\"    It was Venters's wondering, thrilling cry that bridged the fateful  connection between the rider's singular position and the dreaded name.    Tull put out a groping hand. The life of his eyes dulled to the gloom  with which men of his fear saw the approach of death. But death, while  it hovered over him, did not descend, for the rider waited for the  twitching fingers, the downward flash of hand that did not come. Tull,  gathering himself together, turned to the horses, attended by his pale  comrades.        CHAPTER II. COTTONWOODS    Venters appeared too deeply moved to speak the gratitude his face  expressed. And Jane turned upon the rescuer and gripped his hands.  Her smiles and tears seemingly dazed him. Presently as something like  calmness returned, she went to Lassiter's weary horse.    \"I will water him myself,\" she said, and she led the horse to a trough  under a huge old cottonwood. With nimble fingers she loosened the bridle  and removed the bit. The horse snorted and bent his head. The trough was  of solid stone, hollowed out, moss-covered and green and wet and cool,  and the clear brown water that fed it spouted and splashed from a wooden  pipe.    \"He has brought you far to-day?\"    \"Yes, ma'am, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#2)"],[1,"1801.    _A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern  Ocean_, &c.

CHAPTER I    The White Man's Discovery of North America      So far as our knowledge goes, it is almost a matter of certainty that  Man originated in the Old World--in Asia possibly. Long after this  wonderful event in the Earth's history, when the human species was  spread over a good deal of Asia, Europe, and Africa, migration to the  American continents began in attempts to find new feeding grounds and  unoccupied areas for hunting and fishing. How many thousands or  hundreds of thousands of years ago it was since the first men entered  America we do not yet know, any more than we can determine the route  by which they travelled from Asia. Curiously enough, the oldest traces  of man as yet discovered in the New World are not only in South  America, but in the south-eastern parts of South America. Although the  most obvious recent land connection between the Old and New Worlds is  the Aleutian chain of islands connecting Kamschatka with Alaska, the  ethnologist is occasionally led to think by certain evidence that  there may, both earlier and later, have existed another way of  reaching western America from south-eastern Asia through Pacific  archipelagoes and islets now sunk below the sea. In any case it seems  quite probable that men of Mongolian or Polynesian type reached  America on its western coasts long before the European came from the  north-east and east, and that they were helped on this long journey by  touching at islands since submerged by earthquake shocks or tidal  waves.    The aboriginal natives of North and South America seem to be of  entirely Asiatic origin; and such resemblances as there are between  the North-American Indians and the peoples of northern Europe do not  arise (we believe) from any ancient colonization of America from  western or northern Europe, but mainly from the fact that the  North-American Indians and the Eskimo (two distinct types of people)  are descended from the same human stocks as the ancient populations of  the northern part of Europe and Asia.    It was--we think--from the far _north-west_ of Europe that America was  first visited by the true White man, though there has been an ancient  immigration of imperfect \"White\" men (Ainu) from Kamschatka. Three or  four hundred years after the birth of Christ there were great race  movements in northern and central Europe, due to an increase of  population and insufficiency of food. Not only did these white  barbarians (though they were not as barbarous as we were led to think  by Greek and Roman literature) invade southern Europe, North Africa,  and Asia Minor, but from the fourth century of the Christian era  onwards they began to cross over to England and Scotland. At the same  time they took more complete possession of Scandinavia, driving north  before their advance the more primitive peoples like the Lapps and  Finns, who were allied to the stock from which arose both the Eskimo  and the Amerindian.[1] All this time the Goths and Scandinavians  were either learning ideas of navigation from the Romans of the  Mediterranean or the Greeks of the Black Sea, or they were inventing  for themselves better ways of constructing ships; and although they  propelled them mainly by oars, they used masts and sails as well.[2]  Having got over the fear of the sea sufficiently to reach the coasts  of England and Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetlands, they  became still more venturesome in their voyages from Norway, until they  discovered the Faroe Archipelago (which tradition says they found  inhabited by wild sheep), and then the large island of Iceland, which  had, however, already been reached and settled by the northern Irish.    [Footnote 1: This is a convenient name for the race formerly called  \"American Indian\". They are not Indians (i.e. natives of India), and  they are not the only Americans, since there are now about 110,000,000  white Americans of European origin and 24,000,000 negroes and  negroids. The total approximate \"Amerindian\" or aboriginal population  of the New World at the present day is 16,000,000, of whom about  111,000 live in the Canadian Dominion, and 300,000 in the United  States, the remainder in Central and South America.]    [Footnote 2: It is doubtful whether actual masts and sails were known  in America till the coming of Europeans, though the ancient Peruvians  are said to have used mat sails in their canoes. But the northern  Amerindians had got as far as placing bushes or branches of fir trees  upright in their canoes to catch the force of the wind.]    Iceland, though it lies so far to the north that it is partly within  the Arctic Circle, is, like Norway, Scotland, and Ireland, affected by  the Gulf Stream, so that considerable portions of it are quite  habitable. It is not almost entirely covered with ice, as Greenland  is; in fact, Iceland should be called Greenland (from the large extent  of its grassy pastures), and Greenland should be called Iceland.  Instead of this, however, the early Norwegian explorers called these  countries by the names they still bear.    The Norse rovers from Norway and the Hebrides colonized Iceland from  the year 850; and about a hundred and thirty-six years afterwards, in  their venturesome journeys in search of new lands, they reached the  south-east and south-west coasts of Greenland. Owing to the glacial  conditions and elevated character of this vast continental island  (more than 500,000 sq. miles in area)--for the whole interior of  Greenland rises abruptly from the sea-coast to altitudes of from 5000  to 11,000 ft.--this discovery was of small use to the early Norwegians  or their Iceland colony. After it was governed by the kingdom of  Norway in the thirteenth century, the Norse colonization of south-west  Greenland faded away under the attacks of the Eskimo, until it ceased  completely in the fifteenth century. When Denmark united herself with  the kingdom of Norway in 1397, the Danish king became also the ruler  of Iceland. In the eighteenth century the Norwegian and Danish  settlements were re-established along the south-east and south-west  coasts of Greenland, mainly on account of the value of the whale,  seal, and cod fisheries in the seas around this enormous frozen  island; and all Greenland is now regarded as a Danish possession.    But the adventurous Norsemen who first reached Greenland from Iceland  attempted to push their investigations farther to the south-west, in  the hope of discovering more habitable lands; and in this way it was  supposed that their voyages extended as far as Massachusetts and Rhode  Island, but in all probability they reached no farther than  Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. This portion of North America they  called \"Vinland\", more from the abundance of cranberries (_vinbaer_) on  the open spaces than the few vines to be found in the woods of Nova  Scotia.[3]    [Footnote 3: The grapes and vines so often alluded to by the early  explorers of North America ripened, according to the species, between  August and October. They belong to the same genus--_Vitis_--as that of  the grape vines of the Old World, but they were quite distinct in  species. Nowadays they are known as the Fox Grapes (_Vitis vulpina_),  the Frost Grape (_V. cordifolia_), the _V. aestivalis_, the _V.  labruska_, &c. The fruit of the Fox Grape is dark purple, with a very  dusky skin and a musky flavour. The Frost Grape has a very small  berry, which is black or leaden-blue when covered with bloom. It is  very acid to the taste, but from all these grapes it is easy to make a  delicious, refreshing drink. Champlain, however, says that the wild  grapes were often quite large in size, and his men found them  delicious to eat.]    This brings us down to the year 1008. The Icelandic Norsemen then  ceased their investigations of the North-American Continent, and were  too ignorant to realize the value of their discoveries. Their colonies  on the coasts of Nova Scotia (\"Vinland\") and Newfoundland  (\"Estotiland\") were attacked probably by Eskimos, at any rate by a  short, thick-set, yellow-skinned ugly people whom the Norsemen called  \"Skraeling\",[4] who overcame the unfortunate settlers, murdered some,  and carried off others into the interior.    [Footnote 4: Perhaps from the Eastern Eskimo national name _Karalit_.]    But about this period, when Europe was going through that dismal era,  the Dark Age which followed the downfall of the Roman Empire of the  west, various impulses were already directing the attention of  European adventurers to the Western Ocean, the Atlantic. One cause was  the increased hold of Roman and Greek Christianity over the peoples of  Europe. These Churches imposed fasts either for single days or for  continuous periods. When people fasted it meant that they were chiefly  denied any form of meat, and therefore must eat fish if they were not  content with oil, bread, or vegetables. So that there was an enormous  and increasing demand for fish, not only amongst those fortunate  people who lived"]]]
