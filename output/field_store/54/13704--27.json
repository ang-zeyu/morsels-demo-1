THE FALL OF THE MOGHUL EMPIRE OF HINDUSTAN.    PART I.    CHAPTER I.    Preliminary Observations on Hindustan and the City of Dehli.    THE country to which the term Hindustan is strictly and properly  applied may be roughly described as a rhomboid, bounded on the  north-west by the rivers Indus and Satlej, on the south-west by  the Indian Ocean, on the south-east by the Narbadda and the Son,  and on the north-east by the Himalaya Mountains and the river  Ghagra. In the times of the emperors, it comprised the provinces  of Sirhind (or Lahore), Rajputana, Gujrat, Malwa, Audh (including  Rohilkand, strictly Rohelkhand, the country of the Rohelas, or  \"Rohillas\" of the Histories), Agra, Allahabad, and Dehli: and the  political division was into subahs, or divisions, sarkars or  districts; dasturs, or sub-divisions; and parganahs, or fiscal  unions.    The Deccan, Panjab (Punjab), and Kabul, which also formed parts  of the Empire in its widest extension at the end of the  seventeenth century, are omitted, as far as possible, from  notice, because they did not at the time of our narration form  part of the territories of the Empire of Hindustan, though  included in the territory ruled by the earlier and greater  Emperors.    Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa also formed, at one time, an integral  portion of the Empire, but fell away without playing an important  part in the history we are considering, excepting for a very  brief period. The division into Provinces will be understood by  reference to the map. Most of these had assumed a practical  independence during the first quarter of the eighteenth century,  though acknowledging a weak feudatory subordination to the Crown  of Dehli.    The highest point in the plains of Hindustan is probably the  plateau on which stands the town of Ajmir, about 230 miles south  of Dehli. It is situated on the eastern slope of the Aravalli  Mountains, a range of primitive granite, of which Abu, the chief  peak, is estimated to be near 5,000 feet above the level of the  sea; the plateau of Ajmir itself is some 3,000 feet lower.    The country at large is, probably, the upheaved basin of an  exhausted sea which once rendered the highlands of the Deccan an  island like a larger Ceylon. The general quality of the soil is  accordingly sandy and light, though not unproductive; yielding,  perhaps, on an average about one thousand lbs. av. of wheat to  the acre. The cereals are grown in the winter, which is at least  as cold as in the corresponding parts of Africa. Snow never  falls, but thin ice is often formed during the night. During the  spring heavy dews fall, and strong winds set in from the west.  These gradually become heated by the increasing radiation of the  earth, as the sun becomes more vertical and the days longer.    Towards the end of May the monsoon blows up from the Indian Ocean  and from the Bay of Bengal, when a rainfall averaging about  twenty inches takes place and lasts during the ensuing quarter.  This usually ceases about the end of September, when the weather  is at its most sickly point. Constant exhalations of malaria take  place till the return of the cold weather.    After the winter, cacurbitaceous crops are grown, followed by  sowings of rice, sugar, and cotton. About the beginning of the  rainy season the millets and other coarse grains are put in, and  the harvesting takes place in October. The winter crops are  reaped in March and April. Thus the agriculturists are never out  of employ, unless it be during the extreme heats of May and June,  when the soil becomes almost as hard from heat as the earth in  England becomes in the opposite extreme of frost.    Of the hot season Mr. Elphinstone gives the following strong but  just description: Â— \"The sun is scorching, even the wind is hot,  the land is brown and parched, the dust flies in whirlwinds, all  brooks become dry, small rivers scarcely keep up a stream, and  the largest are reduced to comparative narrow channels in the  midst of vast sandy beds.\" It should, however, be added, that  towards the end of this terrible season some relief is afforded  to the river supply by the melting of the snow upon the higher  Himalayas, which sends down some water into the almost exhausted  stream-beds. But even so, the occasional prolongation of the dry  weather leads to universal scarcity which amounts to famine for  the mass of the population, which affects all classes, and which  is sure to be followed by pestilence. Lastly, the malaria noticed  above as following the monsoon gives rise to special disorders  which become endemic in favouring localities, and travel thence  to all parts of the country, borne upon the winds or propagated  by pilgrimages and other forms of human intercourse. Such are the  awful expedients by which Nature checks the redundancy of a  non-emigrating population with simple wants. Hence the  construction of drainage and irrigation-works has not merely a  direct result in causing temporary prosperity, but an indirect  result in a large increase of the responsibilities of the ruling  power. Between 1848 and 1854 the population of the part of  Hindustan now called the North-West Provinces, where all the  above described physical features prevail, increased from a ratio  of 280 to the square mile till it reached a ratio of 350. In the  subsequent sixteen years there was a further increase. The latest  rate appears to be from 378 to 468, and the rate of increase is  believed to be about equal to that of the British Islands.    There were at the time of which we are to treat few  field-labourers on daily wages, the Metayer system being  everywhere prevalent where the soil was not actually owned by  joint-stock associations of peasant proprietors, usually of the  same tribe.    The wants of the cultivators were provided for by a class of  hereditary brokers, who were often also chandlers, and advanced  stock, seed, and money upon the security of the unreaped crops.    These, with a number of artisans and handicraftsmen, formed the  chief population of the towns; some of the money-dealers were  very rich, and 36 per cent. per annum was not perhaps an extreme  rate of interest. There were no silver or gold mines, external  commerce hardly existed, and the money-price of commodities was  low.    The literary and polite language of Hindustan, called Urdu or  Rekhta, was, and still is, so far common to the whole country,  that it everywhere consists of a mixture of the same elements,  though in varying proportions; and follows the same grammatical  rules, though with different accents and idioms. The constituent  parts are the Arabised Persian, and the Prakrit (in combination  with a ruder basis, possibly of local origin), known as Hindi.  Speaking loosely, the Persian speech has contributed nouns  substantive of civilization, and adjectives of compliment or of  science; while the verbs and ordinary vocables and particles  pertaining to common life are derived from the earlier tongues.  So, likewise, are the names of animals, excepting those of beasts  of chase.    The name Urdu, by which this language is usually known, is said  to be of Turkish origin, and means literally \"camp.\" But the  Moghuls of India first introduced it in the precincts of the  Imperial camp; so that as Urdu-i-muali (High or Supreme Camp)  came to be a synonym for new Dehli after Shahjahan had made it  his permanent capital, so Urdu-ki-zaban meant the lingua franca  spoken at Dehli. It was the common method of communication  between different classes, as English may have been in London  under Edward III. The classical languages of Arabia and Persia  were exclusively devoted to uses of law, learning, and religion;  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#2)"],[1,"tterance, and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of  finding language to convey to others what is plain, true and weighty to  himself. This difficulty makes the great Protector, though we can  usually see what he is driving at, frequently confused and obscure.  Lincoln, however, is always clear. Simplicity, directness and breadth  are the notes of his thought. Aptness, clearness, and again, simplicity,  are the notes of his diction. The American speakers of his generation,  like most of those of the preceding generation, but unlike those of that  earlier generation to which Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Marshall and  Madison belonged, were generally infected by a floridity which made them  a by-word in Europe. Even men of brilliant talent, such as Edward  Everett, were by no means free from this straining after effect by  highly-coloured phrases and theatrical effects. Such faults have to-day  virtually vanished from the United States, largely from a change in  public taste, to which perhaps the example set by Lincoln himself may  have contributed. In the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was  rampant, especially in the West and South, where taste was less polished  than in the older States. That Lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of  his independence as well as of his greatness. There is no superfluous  ornament in his orations, nothing tawdry, nothing otiose. For the most  part, he addresses the reason of his hearers, and credits them with  desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them. When he does  appeal to emotion, he does it quietly, perhaps even solemnly. The note  struck is always a high note. The impressiveness of the appeal comes not  from fervid vehemence of language, but from the sincerity of his own  convictions. Sometimes one can see that through its whole course the  argument is suffused by the speaker's feeling, and when the time comes  for the feeling to be directly expressed, it glows not with fitful  flashes, but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul.    The impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that  their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have  not been learnt by heart. But there is an anecdote that on one occasion,  early in his career, Lincoln went to a public meeting not in the least  intending to speak, but presently being called for by the audience, rose  in obedience to the call, and delivered a long address so ardent and  thrilling that the reporters dropped their pencils and, absorbed in  watching him, forgot to take down what he said. It has also been stated,  on good authority, that on his way in the railroad cars, to the  dedication of the monument on the field of Gettysburg, he turned to a  Pennsylvanian gentleman who was sitting beside him and remarked, \"I  suppose I shall be expected to say something this afternoon; lend me a  pencil and a bit of paper,\" and that he thereupon jotted down the notes  of a speech which has become the best known and best remembered of all  his utterances, so that some of its words and sentences have passed into  the minds of all educated men everywhere.    That famous Gettysburg speech is the best example one could desire of  the characteristic quality of Lincoln's eloquence. It is a short speech.  It is wonderfully terse in expression. It is quiet, so quiet that at the  moment it did not make upon the audience, an audience wrought up by a  long and highly-decorated harangue from one of the prominent orators of  the day, an impression at all commensurate to that which it began to  make as soon as it was read over America and Europe. There is in it not  a touch of what we call rhetoric, or of any striving after effect. Alike  in thought and in language it is simple, plain, direct. But it states  certain truths and principles in phrases so aptly chosen and so  forcible, that one feels as if those truths could have been conveyed in  no other words, and as if this deliverance of them were made for all  time. Words so simple and so strong could have come only from one who  had meditated so long upon the primal facts of American history and  popular government that the truths those facts taught him had become  like the truths of mathematics in their clearness, their breadth, and  their precision.    The speeches on Slavery read strange to us now, when slavery as a living  system has been dead for forty years, dead and buried hell deep under  the detestation of mankind. It is hard for those whose memory does not  go back to 1865 to realize that down till then it was not only a  terrible fact, but was defended--defended by many otherwise good men,  defended not only by pseudo-scientific anthropologists as being in the  order of nature, but by ministers of the Gospel, out of the sacred  Scriptures, as part of the ordinances of God. Lincoln's position, the  position of one who had to induce slave-owning fellow-citizens to listen  to him and admit persuasion into their heated and prejudiced minds, did  not allow him to denounce it with horror, as we can all so easily do  to-day. But though his language is calm and restrained, he never  condescends to palter with slavery. He shows its innate evils and  dangers with unanswerable force. The speech on the Dred Scott decision  is a lucid, close and cogent piece of reasoning which, in its wide view  of Constitutional issues, sometimes reminds one of Webster, sometimes  even of Burke, though it does not equal the former in weight nor the  latter in splendour of diction.    Among the letters, perhaps the most impressive is that written to Mrs.  Bixley, the mother of five sons who had died fighting for the Union in  the armies of the North. It is short, and it deals with a theme on which  hundreds of letters are written daily. But I do not know where the  nobility of self-sacrifice for a great cause, and of the consolation  which the thought of a sacrifice so made should bring, is set forth with  such simple and pathetic beauty. Deep must be the fountains from which  there issues so pure a stream.    The career of Lincoln is often held up to ambitious young Americans as  an example to show what a man may achieve by his native strength, with  no advantages of birth or environment or education. In this there is  nothing improper, nothing fanciful. The moral is one which may well be  drawn, and in which those on whose early life Fortune has not smiled may  find encouragement. But the example is, after all, no great  encouragement to ordinary men, for Lincoln was an extraordinary man.    He triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years because  Nature had bestowed on him high and rare powers. Superficial observers  who saw his homely aspect and plain manners, and noted that his  fellow-townsmen, when asked why they so trusted him, answered that it  was for his common-sense, failed to see that his common-sense was a part  of his genius. What is common-sense but the power of seeing the  fundamentals of any practical question, and of disengaging them from the  accidental and transient features that may overlie these  fundamentals--the power, to use a familiar expression, of getting down  to bed rock? One part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what  the average man will think and can be induced to do. This is what keeps  the superior mind in touch with the ordinary mind, and this is perhaps  why the name of \"common-sense\" is used, because the superior mind seems  in its power of comprehending others to be itself a part of the general  sense of the community. All men of high practical capacity have this  power. It is the first condition of success. But in men who have  received a philosophical or literary education there is a tendency to  embellish, for purposes of persuasion, or perhaps for their own  gratification, the language in which they recommend their conclusions,  or to state those conclusions in the light of large general principles,  a tendency which may, unless carefully watched, carry them too high  above the heads of the crowd. Lincoln, never having had such an  education, spoke to the people as one of themselves. He seemed to be  saying not only what each felt, but expressing the feeling just as each  would have expressed it. In reality, he was quite as much above his  neighbours in insight as was the polished orator or writer, but the  plain directness of his language seemed to keep him on their level. His  strength lay less in the form and vesture of the thought than in the  thought itself, in the large, simple, practical view which he took of  the position. And thus, to repeat what has been said already, the  sterling merit of these speeches of his, that which made them effective  when they were delivered and makes them worth reading to-day, is to be  found in the justness of his conclusions and their fitness to the  circumstances of the time. When he rose into higher air, when his words  were clothed with stateliness and solemnity, it was the force of his  conviction and the emotion that thrilled through his utterance, that  printed the words deep upon the minds and drove them home to the hearts  of the people.    What is a great man? Common speech, which after all must be our guide to  the sense of the terms which the world uses, gives this name to many  sorts of men. How far greatness lies in the power and range of the  intellect, how far in the strength of the will, how far in elevation of  view and aim and purpose,--this is a question too large to be debated  here. But of Abraham Lincoln it may be truly said that in his greatness  all three elements were present. He had not the brilliance, either in  thought or word or act, that dazzles, nor the restless activity that  occasionally pushes to the front even persons with gifts not of the  first order. He was a patient, thoughtful, melancholy man, whose  intelligence, working sometimes slowly but always steadily and surely,  was"]]]
