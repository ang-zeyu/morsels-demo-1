In fact, Canada has a rich heritage of associations that connect us with  some of the most momentous epochs of the world's history. The victories  of Louisbourg and Quebec belong to the same series of brilliant events  that recall the famous names of Chatham, Clive, and Wolfe, and that gave  to England a mighty empire in Asia and America. Wolfe's signal victory  on the heights of the ancient capital was the prelude to the great drama  of the American revolution. Freed from the fear of France, the people of  the Thirteen Colonies, so long hemmed in between the Atlantic Ocean and  the Appalachian range, found full expression for their love of local  self-government when England asserted her imperial supremacy. After a  struggle of a few years they succeeded in laying the foundation of the  remarkable federal republic, which now embraces forty-five states with a  population of already seventy-five millions of souls, which owes its  national stability and prosperity to the energy and enterprise of the  Anglo-Norman race and the dominant influence of the common law, and the  parliamentary institutions of England. At the same time, the American  Revolution had an immediate and powerful effect upon the future of the  communities that still remained in the possession of England after the  acknowledgement of the independence of her old colonies. It drove to  Canada a large body of men and women, who remained faithful to the crown  and empire and became founders of provinces which are now comprised in a  Dominion extending for over three thousand miles to the north and east  of the federal republic.    The short review of the French regime, with which I am about to  commence this history of Canada, will not give any evidence of  political, economic, or intellectual development under the influence of  French dominion, but it is interesting to the student of comparative  politics on account of the comparisons which it enables us to make  between the absolutism of old France which crushed every semblance of  independent thought and action, and the political freedom which has been  a consequence of the supremacy of England in the province once occupied  by her ancient rival. It is quite true, as Professor Freeman has said,  that in Canada, which is pre-eminently English in the development of its  political institutions, French Canada is still \"a distinct and visible  element, which is not English,--an element older than anything English  in the land,--and which shows no sign of being likely to be assimilated  by anything English.\" As this book will show, though a hundred and forty  years have nearly passed since the signing of the treaty of Paris, many  of the institutions which the French Canadians inherited from France  have become permanently established in the country, and we see  constantly in the various political systems given to Canada from time to  time--notably in the constitution of the federal union--the impress of  these institutions and the influence of the people of the French  section. Still, while the French Canadians by their adherence to their  language, civil law and religion are decidedly \"a distinct and visible  element which is not English\"--an element kept apart from the English by  positive legal and constitutional guarantees or barriers of  separation,--we shall see that it is the influence and operation of  English institutions, which have made their province one of the most  contented communities of the world. While their old institutions are  inseparably associated with the social and spiritual conditions of their  daily lives, it is after all their political constitution, which derives  its strength from English, principles, that has made the French  Canadians a free, self-governing people and developed the best elements  of their character to a degree which was never possible under the  depressing and enfeebling conditions of the French regime.      SECTION 2.--Discovery and settlement of Canada by France.    Much learning has been devoted to the elucidation of the Icelandic  Sagas, or vague accounts of voyages which Bjorne Heriulfson and Lief  Ericsson, sons of the first Norse settlers of Greenland, are supposed to  have made at the end of the tenth century, to the eastern parts of what  is now British North America, and, in the opinion of some writers, even  as far as the shores of New England. It is just possible that such  voyages were made, and that Norsemen were the first Europeans who saw  the eastern shores of Canada. It is quite certain, however, that no  permanent settlements were made by the Norsemen in any part of these  countries; and their voyages do not appear to have been known to  Columbus or other maritime adventurers of later times, when the veil of  mystery was at last lifted from the western limits of what was so long  truly described as the \"sea of darkness.\" While the subject is  undoubtedly full of interest, it is at the same time as illusive as the  _fata morgana_, or the lakes and rivers that are created by the mists of  a summer's eve on the great prairies of the Canadian west.    Five centuries later than the Norse voyagers, there appeared on the  great field of western exploration an Italian sailor, Giovanni Caboto,  through whose agency England took the first step in the direction of  that remarkable maritime enterprise which, in later centuries, was to be  the admiration and envy of all other nations. John Cabot was a Genoese  by birth and a Venetian citizen by adoption, who came during the last  decade of the fifteenth century, to the historic town of Bristol.  Eventually he obtain from Henry VII letters-patent, granting to himself  and his three sons, Louis, Sebastian, and Sancio, the right, \"at their  own cost and charges, to seek out and discover unknown lands,\" and to  acquire for England the dominion over the countries they might discover.  Early in May, 1497, John Cabot sailed from Bristol in \"The Matthew,\"  manned by English sailors. In all probability he was accompanied by  Sebastian, then about 21 years of age, who, in later times, through the  credulity of his friends and his own garrulity and vanity, took that  place in the estimation of the world which his father now rightly fills.  Some time toward the end of June, they made a land-fall on the  north-eastern coast of North America. The actual site of the land-fall  will always be a matter of controversy unless some document is found  among musty archives of Europe to solve the question to the satisfaction  of the disputants, who wax hot over the claims of a point near Cape  Chidley on the coast of Labrador, of Bonavista, on the east shore of  Newfoundland, of Cape North, or some other point, on the island of Cape  Breton. Another expedition left Bristol in 1498, but while it is now  generally believed that Cabot coasted the shores of North America from  Labrador or Cape Breton as far as Cape Hatteras, we have no details of  this famous voyage, and are even ignorant of the date when the fleet  returned to England.    The Portuguese, Gaspar and Miguel Cortereal, in the beginning of the  sixteenth century, were lost somewhere on the coast of Labrador or  Newfoundland, but not before they gave to their country a claim to new  lands. The Basques and Bretons, always noted for their love of the sea,  frequented the same prolific waters and some of the latter gave a name  to the picturesque island of Cape Breton. Giovanni da Verrazzano, a  Florentine by birth, who had for years led a roving life on the sea,  sailed in 1524 along the coasts of Nova Scotia and the present United  States and gave a shadowy claim of first discovery of a great region to  France under whose authority he sailed. Ten years later Jacques Cartier  of St. Malo was authorised by Francis I to undertake a voyage to these  new lands, but he did not venture beyond the Gulf of St. Lawrence,  though he took possession of the picturesque Gaspe peninsula in the name  of his royal master. In 1535 he made a second voyage, whose results were  most important for France and the world at large. The great river of  Canada was then discovered by the enterprising Breton, who established a  post for some months at Stadacona, now Quebec, and also visited the  Indian village of Hochelaga on the island of Montreal. Here he gave the  appropriate name of Mount Royal to the beautiful height which dominates  the picturesque country where enterprise has, in the course of  centuries, built a noble city. Hochelaga was probably inhabited by  Indians of the Huron-Iroquois family, who appear, from the best evidence  before us, to have been dwelling at that time on the banks of the St.  Lawrence, whilst the Algonquins, who took their place in later times,  were living to the north of the river.    The name of Canada--obviously the Huron-Iroquois word for Kannata, a  town--began to take a place on the maps soon after Cartier's voyages. It  appears from his _Bref Recit_ to have been applied at the time of his  visit, to a kingdom, or district, extending from Ile-aux-Coudres, which  he named on account of its hazel-nuts, on the lower St. Lawrence, to the  Kingdom of Ochelay, west of Stadacona; east of Canada was Saguenay, and  west of Ochelay was Hochelaga, to which the other communities were  tributary. After a winter of much misery Cartier left Stadacona in the  spring of 1536, and sailed into the Atlantic by the passage between Cape  Breton and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12664"],[0,"Lyrics of Earth (#2)"],[1," wide on the eternal way,        The services of earth, the life of man;      And, listening to the magic cry they say:        \"It is the note of Pan!\"        For, long ago, when the new strains        Of hostile hymns and conquering faiths grew keen,      And the old gods from their deserted fanes,        Fled silent and unseen,        So, too, the goat-foot Pan, not less        Sadly obedient to the mightier hand,      Cut him new reeds, and in a sore distress        Passed out from land to land;        And lingering by each haunt he knew,        Of fount or sinuous stream or grassy marge,      He set the syrinx to his lips, and blew        A note divinely large;        And all around him on the wet        Cool earth the frogs came up, and with a smile      He took them in his hairy hands, and set        His mouth to theirs awhile,        And blew into their velvet throats;        And ever from that hour the frogs repeat      The murmur of Pan's pipes, the notes,        And answers strange and sweet;        And they that hear them are renewed        By knowledge in some god-like touch conveyed,      Entering again into the eternal mood,        Wherein the world was made.          THE MEADOW          Here when the cloudless April days begin,          And the quaint crows flock thicker day by day,      Filling the forests with a pleasant din,          And the soiled snow creeps secretly away,      Comes the small busy sparrow, primed with glee,          First preacher in the naked wilderness,          Piping an end to all the long distress      From every fence and every leafless tree.        Now with soft slight and viewless artifice          Winter's iron work is wondrously undone;      In all the little hollows cored with ice          The clear brown pools stand simmering in the sun,      Frail lucid worlds, upon whose tremulous floors          All day the wandering water-bugs at will,          Shy mariners whose oars are never still,      Voyage and dream about the heightening shores.        The bluebird, peeping from the gnarled thorn,          Prattles upon his frolic flute, or flings,      In bounding flight across the golden morn,          An azure gleam from off his splendid wings.      Here the slim-pinioned swallows sweep and pass          Down to the far-off river; the black crow          With wise and wary visage to and fro      Settles and stalks about the withered grass.        Here, when the murmurous May-day is half gone,          The watchful lark before my feet takes flight,      And wheeling to some lonelier field far on,          Drops with obstreperous cry; and here at night,      When the first star precedes the great red moon,          The shore-lark tinkles from the darkening field,          Somewhere, we know not, in the dusk concealed,      His little creakling and continuous tune.        Here, too, the robins, lusty as of old,          Hunt the waste grass for forage, or prolong      From every quarter of these fields the bold,          Blithe phrases of their never-finished song.      The white-throat's distant descant with slow stress          Note after note upon the noonday falls,          Filling the leisured air at intervals      With his own mood of piercing pensiveness.        How often from this windy upland perch,          Mine eyes have seen the forest break in bloom,      The rose-red maple and the golden birch,          The dusty yellow of the elms, the gloom      Of the tall poplar hung with tasseled black;          Ah, I have watched, till eye and ear and brain          Grew full of dreams as they, the moted plain,      The sun-steeped wood, the marsh-land at its back,        The valley where the river wheels and fills,          Yon city glimmering in its smoky shroud,      And out at the last misty rim the hills          Blue and far off and mounded like a cloud,      And here the noisy rutted road that goes          Down the slope yonder, flanked on either side          With the smooth-furrowed fields flung black and wide,      Patched with pale water sleeping in the rows.        So as I watched the crowded leaves expand,          The bloom break sheath, the summer's strength uprear,      In earth's great mother's heart already planned          The heaped and burgeoned plenty of the year,      Even as she from out her wintry cell          My spirit also sprang to life anew,          And day by day as the spring's bounty grew,      Its conquering joy possessed me like a spell.        In reverie by day and midnight dream          I sought these upland fields and walked apart,      Musing on Nature, till my thought did seem          To read the very secrets of her heart;      In mooded moments earnest and sublime          I stored the themes of many a future song,          Whose substance should be Nature's, clear and strong,      Bound in a casket of majestic rhyme.        Brave bud-like plans that never reached the fruit,          Like hers our mother's who with every hour,      Easily replenished from the sleepless root,          Covers her bosom with fresh bud and flower;      Yet I was happy as young lovers be,          Who in the season of their passion's birth          Deem that they have their utmost worship's worth,      If love be near them, just to hear and see.          IN MAY          Grief was my master yesternight;          To-morrow I may grieve again;          But now along the windy plain            The clouds have taken flight.        The sowers in the furrows go;          The lusty river brimmeth on;          The curtains from the hills are gone;            The leaves are out; and lo,        The silvery distance of the day,          The light horizons, and between          The glory of the perfect green,            The tumult of the May.        The bobolinks at noonday sing          More softly than the softest flute,          And lightlier than the lightest lute            Their fairy tambours ring.        The roads far off are towered with dust;          The cherry-blooms are swept and thinned;          In yonder swaying elms the wind            Is charging gust on gust.        But here there is no stir at all;          The ministers of sun and shadow          Horde all the perfumes of the meadow            Behind a grassy wall.        An infant rivulet wind-free          Adown the guarded hollow sets,          Over whose brink the violets            Are nodding peacefully.        From pool to pool it prattles by;          The flashing swallows dip and pass,          Above the tufted marish grass,            And here at rest am I.        I care not for the old distress,          Nor if to-morrow bid me moan;          To-day is mine, and I have known            An hour of blessedness.          LIFE AND NATURE          I passed through the gates of the city,        The streets were strange and still,      Through the doors of the open churches        The organs were moaning shrill.        Through the doors and the great high windows        I heard the murmur of prayer,      And the sound of their solemn singing        Streamed out on the sunlit air;        A sound of some great burden        That lay on the world's dark breast,      Of the old, and the sick, and the lonely,        And the weary that cried for rest.        I strayed through the midst of the city        Like one distracted or mad.      \"Oh, Life! Oh, Life!\" I kept saying,        And the very word seemed sad.        I passed through the gates of the city,        And I heard the small birds sing,      I laid me down in the meadows        Afar from the bell-ringing.        In the depth and the bloom of the meadows        I lay on the earth's quiet breast,      The poplar fanned me with shadows,        And the veery sang me to rest.        Blue, blue was the heaven above me,        And the earth green at my feet;      \"Oh, Life! Oh, Life!\" I kept saying,        And the very word seemed sweet.          WITH THE NIGHT          O doubts, dull passions, and base fears,        That harassed and oppressed the day,      Ye poor remorses and vain tears,        That shook this house of clay:        All heaven to the western bars        Is glittering with the darker dawn;      Here with the earth, the night, the stars,        Ye have no place: begone!          JUNE          Long, long ago, it seems, this summer morn          That pale-browed April passed with pensive tread          Through the frore woods, and from its frost-bound bed      Woke the arbutus with her silver horn;              And now May, too, is fled,      The flower-crowned month, the merry laughing May,          With rosy feet and fingers dewy wet,      Leaving the woods and all cool gardens gay          With tulips and the scented violet.        Gone are the wind-flower and the adder-tongue          And the sad drooping bellwort, and no more          The snowy trilliums crowd the forest's floor;      The purpling grasses are no longer young,              And summer's wide-set door      O'er the thronged hills and the broad panting earth          Lets in the torrent of the later bloom,      Haytime, and harvest, and the after mirth,          The slow soft rain, the rushing thunder plume.        All day in garden alleys moist and dim,          The humid air is burdened with the rose;          In moss-deep woods the creamy orchid blows;      And now the vesper-sparrows' pealing hymn              From every orchard close      At eve comes flooding rich and silvery;          The daisies in great meadows swing and shine;      And with the wind a sound as of the sea          Roars in the maples and the topmost pine.        High in the hills the solitary thrush          Tunes magically his music of fine dreams,          In briary dells, by boulder-broken streams;      And wide and far on nebulous fields aflush              The mellow morning gleams.      The orange cone-flowers purple-bossed are there,          The meadow's bold-eyed"]]]
