In a few years the old aunt died,  and left the two young ladies without any controul; which as soon as  their cousin Mr. Manley heard, he hasted into the country, to visit  them; appeared in deep mourning, as he said for the death of his wife;  upon which the young ladies congratulated him, as they knew his wife  was a woman of a most turbulent temper, and ill fitted to render the  conjugal life tolerable.    This gentleman, who had seen a great deal of the world, and was  acquainted with all the artifices of seducing, lost no time in making  love to his cousin, who was no otherwise pleased with it, than as  it answered something to the character she had found in those books,  which had poisoned and deluded her dawning reason. Soon after these  protestations of love were made, the young lady fell into a fever,  which was like to prove fatal to her life.    The lover and her sister never quitted the chamber for sixteen nights,  nor took any other repose than throwing themselves alternately upon a  little pallet in the same room. Having in her nature a great deal of  gratitude, and a very tender sense of benefits; she promised upon  her recovery to marry her guardian, which as soon as her health  was sufficiently restored, she performed in the presence of a maid  servant, her sister, and a gentleman who had married a relation. In a  word, she was married, possessed, and ruin'd.    The husband of our poetess brought her to London, fixed her in a  remote quarter of it, forbad her to stir out of doors, or to receive  the visits of her sister, or any other relations, friends, or  acquaintance. This usage, she thought exceeding barbarous, and it  grieved her the more excessively, since she married him only because  she imagined he loved and doated on her to distraction; for as  his person was but ordinary, and his age disproportioned, being  twenty-years older than she, it could not be imagined that she was in  love with him.--She was very uneasy at being kept a prisoner; but  her husband's fondness and jealousy was made the pretence. She always  loved reading, to which she was now more than ever obliged, as so  much time lay upon her hands: Soon after she proved with child, and  so perpetually ill, that she implored her husband to let her enjoy the  company of her sister and friends. When he could have no relief from  her importunity (being assured that in seeing her relations, she must  discover his barbarous deceit) he thought it was best to be himself  the relator of his villany; he fell upon his knees before her, with so  much seeming confusion, distress and anguish, that she was at a loss  to know what could mould his stubborn heart to such contrition. At  last, with a thousand well counterfeited tears, and sighs, he stabb'd  her with the wounding relation of his wife's being still alive; and  with a hypocrite's pangs conjured her to have some mercy on a lost  man as he was, in an obstinate, inveterate passion, that had no  alternative but death, or possession.    He urged, that could he have supported the pain of living without  her, he never would have made himself so great a villain; but when the  absolute question was, whether he should destroy himself, or betray  her, self-love had turned the ballance, though not without that  anguish to his soul, which had poisoned all his delights, and planted  daggers to stab his peace. That he had a thousand times started in  his sleep with guilty apprehensions; the form of her honoured father  perpetually haunting his troubled dreams, reproaching him as a traitor  to that trust which in his departing moments he had reposed in him;  representing to his tortured imagination the care he took of his  education, more like a father than an uncle, with which he had  rewarded him by effecting the perdition of his favourite daughter, who  was the lovely image of his benefactor.    With this artful contrition he endeavoured to sooth his injured wife:  But what soothing could heal the wounds she had received? Horror!  amazement! sense of honour lost! the world's opinion! ten thousand  distresses crowded her distracted imagination, and she cast looks upon  the conscious traitor with horrible dismay! Her fortune was in his  hands, the greatest part of which was already lavished away in the  excesses of drinking and gaming. She was young, unacquainted with the  world; had never experienced necessity, and knew no arts of redressing  it; so that thus forlorn and distressed, to whom could she run for  refuge, even from want, and misery, but to the very traitor that had  undone her. She was acquainted with none that could or would espouse  her cause, a helpless, useless load of grief and melancholy! with  child! disgraced! her own relations either unable, or unwilling to  relieve her.    Thus was she detained by unhappy circumstances, and his prevailing  arts to wear away three wretched years with him, in the same house,  though she most solemnly protests, and she has a right to be believed,  that no persuasion could ever again reconcile her to his impious arms.  Whenever she cast her eyes upon her son, it gave a mortal wound to her  peace: The circumstances of his birth glared full on her imagination;  she saw him, in future, upbraided with his father's treachery, and  his mother's misfortunes. Thus forsaken of all the world, in the  very morning of her life, when all things should have been gay, and  promising, she wore away three wretched years. Mean time her betrayer  had procured for himself a considerable employment; the duties of  which obliged him to go into the country where his first wife lived.  He took leave of his injured innocent, with much seeming tenderness;  and made the most sacred protestations, that he would not suffer her,  nor her child ever to want.    He endeavoured to persuade her to accompany him into the country, and  to seduce, and quiet her conscience, shewed her a celebrated piece  written in defence of Polygamy, and Concubinage: When he was gone,  he soon relapsed into his former extravagances, forgot his promise  of providing for his child, and its mother; and inhumanly left them  a prey to indigence and oppression. The lady was only happy in being  released from the killing anguish, of every day having before her eyes  the object of her undoing.    When she again came abroad into the world, she was looked upon with  cold indifference; that which had been her greatest misfortune, was  imputed to her as the most enormous guilt; and she was every  where sneered at, avoided, and despised. What pity is it, that an  unfortunate, as well as a false step, should damn a woman's fame!  In what respect was Mrs. Manley to blame? In what particular was she  guilty? to marry her cousin, who passionately professed love to her,  and who solemnly vowed himself a widower, could not be guilt; on  the other hand, it had prudence and gratitude for its basis. Her  continuing in the house with him after he had made the discovery,  cannot be guilt, for by doing so, she was prevented from being exposed  to such necessities as perhaps would have produced greater ruin. When  want and beggary stare a woman in the face, especially one accustomed  to the delicacies of life, then indeed is virtue in danger; and they  who escape must have more than human assistance.    Our poetess now perceived, that together with her reputation, she had  lost all the esteem, that her conversation and abilities might have  else procured her; and she was reduced to the deplorable necessity of  associating with those whose fame was blasted by their indiscretion,  because the more sober and virtuous part of the sex did not care  to risk their own characters, by being in company with one so much  suspected, and against whom the appearance of guilt was too strong.    Under this dilemma, it is difficult to point out any method of  behaviour, by which she would not be exposed to censure: If she had  still persisted in solitude, the ill-natured world would have imputed  to it a cause, which is not founded on virtue; besides, as the means  of support were now removed, by the perfidy of Mr. Manley, she must  have perished by this resolution.    In this case, the reader will not be much surprized to find our  authoress, under the patronage of the duchess of Cleveland, a mistress  of king Charles the IId's, who was justly reckoned one of the most  celebrated beauties of that age. Mrs. Manley was paying a visit to  a lady of her grace's acquaintance, when she was introduced into the  favour of this royal courtezan; and as the duchess of Cleveland was  a woman of parts and genius, she could not but be charmed with the  sprightliness of her conversation. She was fond of new faces, and  immediately contracted the greatest intimacy with our poetess, and  gave her a general invitation to her table. The lady at whose house  the duchess became acquainted with Mrs. Manley, soon perceived her  indiscretion in bringing them together; for the love of novelty so far  prevailed on the duchess, that herself was immediately discarded, and  the affection formerly bestowed upon her, was lavished on Mrs. Manley.    This procured our poetess an inveterate enemy; and the greatest blow  that was ever struck at her reputation, was by that woman, who had  been before her friend. She was not content to inform persons who  began to know and esteem Mrs. Manley, that her marriage was a  cheat; but even endeavoured to make the duchess jealous of her new  favourite's charms, in respect of Mr. Goodman the player, who at  that time had the honour of approaching her grace's person, with the  freedom of a gallant.    As the duchess of Cleveland was a woman of a very fickle temper,  in six months time she began to be tired of Mrs. Manley. She was  quarrelsome, loquacious, fierce, excessively fond, or downright rude;  when she was disgusted with any person, she never failed to reproach  them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12017"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Seguier, of Paris, of the  peculiar vegetable matter, now called tannin. He was, during the same  period, frequently occupied in experiments on galvanism.    To the agriculturist, chemistry is of the first consideration. The  dependence of agriculture upon chemical causes had been previously  noticed, but it was first completely demonstrated in a course of lectures  before the Board of Agriculture, which Mr. Davy commenced in the year  1802, and continued for ten years. This series of lectures contained much  popular and practical information, and belongs to the most useful of Mr.  Davy's scientific labours; for the application of chemistry to  agriculture is one of its most important results; and so rapid were the  discoveries of the author, that in preparing these discourses for  publication, a few years afterwards, he was under the necessity of making  several alterations, to adapt them to the improved state of chemical  knowledge, which his own labours had, in that short time, produced.    In 1803, he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1805, a  member of the Royal Irish Academy. He now enjoyed the friendship of most  of the distinguished literary men and philosophers of the metropolis, and  enumerated among his intimate friends, Sir Joseph Banks, Cavendish,  Hatchett, Wollaston, Children, Tennant, and other eminent men. At the  same time he corresponded with the principal chemists of every part of  Europe. In 1806, he was appointed to deliver, before the Royal Society,  the Bakerian lecture, in which he displayed some very interesting new  agencies of electricity, by means of the celebrated galvanic apparatus.[1]  Soon afterwards, he made one of the most brilliant discoveries of modern  times, in the decomposition of two fixed alkalies, which, in direct  refutation of the hypothesis previously adopted, were found to consist of  a peculiar metallic base united with a large quantity of oxygen. These  alkalies were potash and soda, and the metals thus discovered were called  potassium and sodium, Mr. Davy was equally successful in the application  of galvanism to the decomposition of the earths. About this time he  became Secretary of the Royal Society. In 1808, Mr. Davy received a prize  from the French Institute. During the greater part of 1810, he was  employed on the combinations of oxymuriatic gas and oxygen; and towards  the close of the same year, he delivered a course of lectures before the  Dublin Society, and received from Trinity College, Dublin, the honorary  degree of LL. D.    In the year 1812, Mr. Davy married his amiable lady, then Mrs. Apreece,  widow of Shuckburgh Ashby Apreece, Esq. and daughter and heiress of the  late Charles Kerr, of Kelso, Esq. By his union with this lady, Mr. Davy  acquired not only a considerable fortune, but the inestimable treasure of  an affectionate and exemplary wife, and a congenial friend and companion,  capable of appreciating his character and attainments. A few days  previously to his marriage, he received the honour of knighthood from his  Majesty, then Prince Regent, being the first person on whom he conferred  that dignity.    We now arrive at the most important result of Sir Humphry Davy's labours,  viz. the invention of the SAFETY-LAMP for coal mines, which has been  generally and successfully adopted throughout Europe. This invention has  been the means of preserving many valuable lives, and preventing horrible  mutilations, more terrible even than death; and were this Sir Humphry  Davy's only invention, it would secure him an immortality in the annals  of civilization and science. The general principle of this discovery may  be described as follows:    \"The frequency of accidents, arising from the explosion of the fire-damp,  or inflammable gas of the coal mines, mixed with atmospherical air,  occasioned the formation of a committee at Sunderland, for the purpose of  investigating the causes of these calamities, and of endeavouring to  discover and apply a preventive. Sir Humphry received an invitation, in  1815, from Dr. Gray, one of the members of the committee; in consequence  of which he went to the North of England, and visiting some of the  principal collieries in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, soon convinced  himself that no improvement could be made in the mode of ventilation, but  that the desired preventive must be sought in a new method of lighting  the mines, free from danger, and which, by indicating the state of the  air in the part of the mine where inflammable air was disengaged, so as  to render the atmosphere explosive, should oblige the miners to retire  till the workings were properly cleared. The common means then employed  for lighting the dangerous part of the mines consisted of a steel wheel  revolving in contact with flint, and affording a succession of sparks:  but this apparatus always required a person to work it, and was not  entirely free from danger. The fire-damp was known to be light  carburetted hydrogen gas; but its relations to combustion had not been  examined. It is chiefly produced from what are called blowers or fissures  in the broken strata, near dykes. Sir Humphry made various experiments on  its combustibility and explosive nature; and discovered, that the  fire-damp requires a very strong heat for its inflammation; that azote and  carbonic acid, even in very small proportions, diminished the velocity of  the inflammation; that mixtures of the gas would not explode in metallic  canals or troughs, where their diameter was less than one-seventh of an  inch, and their depth considerable in proportion to their diameter; and  that explosions could not be made to pass through such canals, or through  very fine wire sieves, or wire gauze. The consideration of these facts  led Sir Humphry to adopt a lamp, in which the flame, by being supplied  with only a limited quantity of air should produce such a quantity of  azote and carbonic acid as to prevent the explosion of the fire-damp, and  which, by the nature of its apertures for giving admittance and egress to  the air, should be rendered incapable of communicating any explosion to  the external air. These requisites were found to be afforded by air-tight  lanterns, of various constructions, supplied with air from tubes or  canals of small diameter, or from apertures covered with wire-gauze,  placed below the flame, through which explosions cannot be communicated;  and having a chimney at the upper part, for carrying off the foul air.  Sir Humphry soon afterwards found that a constant flame might be kept up  from the explosive mixture issuing from the apertures of a wire-gauze  sieve. He introduced a very small lamp in a cylinder, made of wire-gauze,  having six thousand four hundred apertures in the square inch. He closed  all apertures except those of the gauze, and introduced the lamp, burning  brightly within the cylinder, into a large jar, containing several quarts  of the most explosive mixture of gas from the distillation of coal and  air; the flame of the wick immediately disappeared, or rather was lost,  for the whole of the interior of the cylinder became filled with a feeble  but steady flame of a green colour, which burnt for some minutes, till it  had entirely destroyed the explosive power of the atmosphere. This  discovery led to a most important improvement in the lamp, divested the  fire-damp of all its terrors, and applied its powers, formerly so  destructive, to the production of a useful light. Some minor  improvements, originating in Sir Humphry's researches into the nature of  flame, were afterwards effected. Experiments of the most satisfactory  nature were speedily made, and the invention was soon generally adopted.  Some attempts were made to dispute the honour of this discovery with its  author, but his claims were confirmed by the investigations of the first  philosophers of the age.\"[2]--The coal owners of the Tyne and Wear  evinced their sense of the benefits resulting from this invention, by  presenting Sir Humphry with a handsome service of plate worth nearly two  thousand pounds, at a public dinner at Newcastle, October 11, 1817.    In 1813, Sir Humphry was elected a corresponding member of the Institute  of France, and vice-president of the Royal Institution; in 1817, one of  the eight associates of the Royal Academy; in 1818 created a baronet, and  during the last ten years he has been elected a member of most of the  learned bodies of Europe.    We could occupy many pages with the interesting details of Sir Humphry  Davy's travels in different parts of Europe for scientific purposes,  particularly to investigate the causes of volcanic phenomena, to instruct  the miners of the coal districts in the application of his safety-lamp,  and to examine the state of the Herculaneum manuscripts and to illustrate  the remains of the chemical arts of the ancients. He analyzed the colours  used in painting by the ancient Greek and Roman artists. His experiments  were chiefly made on the paintings in the baths of Titus, the ruins  called the baths of Livia, in the remains of other palaces and baths of  ancient Rome, and in the ruins of Pompeii. By the kindness of his friend  Canova, who was charged with the care of the works connected with ancient  art in Rome, he was enabled to select with his own hands specimens of the  different pigments, that had been formed in vases discovered in the  excavations, which had been lately made beneath the ruins of the palace  of Titus, and to compare them with the colours fixed on the walls, or  detached in fragments of stucco. The results of all these researches were  published in the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1815, and are  extremely interesting. The concluding observations, in which he impresses  on artists the superior importance of permanency to brilliancy in the  colours"]]]
