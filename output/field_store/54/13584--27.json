Evidences of the wide extent of astrological belief in those days are  abundant, many instances of which we shall doubtless encounter in our  excursions.    It has been said that the theological and philosophical atmosphere of  the Middle Ages was \"scholastic,\" not mystical. No doubt \"mysticism,\" as  a mode of life aiming at the realisation of the presence of God, is  as distinct from scholasticism as empiricism is from rationalism,  or \"tough-minded\" philosophy (to use JAMES' happy phrase) is from  \"tender-minded\". But no philosophy can be absolutely and purely  deductive. It must start from certain empirically determined facts. A  man might be an extreme empiricist in religion (_i.e_. a mystic),  and yet might attempt to deduce all other forms of knowledge from the  results of his religious experiences, never caring to gather experience  in any other realm. Hence the breach between mysticism and scholasticism  is not really so wide as may appear at first sight. Indeed,  scholasticism officially recognised three branches of theology, of which  the MYSTICAL was one. I think that mysticism and scholasticism both had  a profound influence on the mediaeval mind, sometimes acting as opposing  forces, sometimes operating harmoniously with one another. As Professor  WINDELBAND puts it: \"We no longer onesidedly characterise the philosophy  of the middle ages as scholasticism, but rather place mysticism beside  it as of equal rank, and even as being the more fruitful and promising  movement.\"(1)      (1) Professor WILHELM WINDELBAND, Ph.D.: \"Present-Day Mysticism,\" _The  Quest_, vol. iv. (1913), P. 205.      Alchemy, with its four Aristotelian or scholastic elements and its  three mystical principles--sulphur, mercury, salt,--must be cited as  the outstanding product of the combined influence of mysticism and  scholasticism: of mysticism, which postulated the unity of the Cosmos,  and hence taught that everything natural is the expressive image and  type of some supernatural reality; of scholasticism, which taught men  to rely upon deduction and to restrict experimentation to the smallest  possible limits.    The mind naturally proceeds from the known, or from what is supposed to  be known, to the unknown. Indeed, as I have already indicated, it must  so proceed if truth is to be gained. Now what did the men of the Middle  Ages regard as falling into the category of the known? Why, surely, the  truths of revealed religion, whether accepted upon authority or upon  the evidence of their own experience. The realm of spiritual and moral  reality: there, they felt, they were on firm ground. Nature was a realm  unknown; but they had analogy to guide, or, rather, misguide them.  Nevertheless if, as we know, it misguided, this was not, I think,  because the mystical doctrine of the correspondence between the  spiritual and the natural is unsound, but because these ancient seekers  into Nature's secrets knew so little, and so frequently misapplied what  they did know. So alchemical philosophy arose and became systematised,  with its wonderful endeavour to perfect the base metals by the  Philosopher's Stone--the concentrated Essence of Nature,--as man's soul  is perfected through the life-giving power of JESUS CHRIST.    I want, in conclusion to these brief introductory remarks, to say a  few words concerning phallicism in connection with my topic. For some  \"tender-minded\"(1) and, to my thought, obscure, reason the subject is  tabooed. Even the British Museum does not include works on phallicism  in its catalogue, and special permission has to be obtained to consult  them. Yet the subject is of vast importance as concerns the origin  and development of religion and philosophy, and the extent of phallic  worship may be gathered from the widespread occurrence of obelisks and  similar objects amongst ancient relics. Our own maypole dances may be  instanced as one survival of the ancient worship of the male generative  principle.      (1) I here use the term with the extended meaning Mr H. G. WELLS has  given to it. See _The New Machiavelli_.      What could be more easy to understand than that, when man first  questioned as to the creation of the earth, he should suppose it to have  been generated by some process analogous to that which he saw held in  the case of man? How else could he account for its origin, if knowledge  must proceed from the known to the unknown? No one questions at all  that the worship of the human generative organs as symbols of the dual  generative principle of Nature degenerated into orgies of the most  frightful character, but the view of Nature which thus degenerated is  not, I think, an altogether unsound one, and very interesting remnants  of it are to be found in mediaeval philosophy.    These remnants are very marked in alchemy. The metals, as I have  suggested, are there regarded as types of man; hence they are  produced from seed, through the combination of male and female  principles--mercury and sulphur, which on the spiritual plane are  intelligence and love. The same is true of that Stone which is perfect  Man. As BERNARD of TREVISAN (1406-1490) wrote in the fifteenth century:  \"This Stone then is compounded of a Body and Spirit, or of a volatile  and fixed Substance, and that is therefore done, because nothing in  the World can be generated and brought to light without these two  Substances, to wit, a Male and Female: From whence it appeareth, that  although these two Substances are not of one and the same species, yet  one Stone doth thence arise, and although they appear and are said to be  two Substances, yet in truth it is but one, to wit, _Argent-vive_.\"(1)  No doubt this sounds fantastic; but with all their seeming intellectual  follies these old thinkers were no fools. The fact of sex is the most  fundamental fact of the universe, and is a spiritual and physical as  well as a physiological fact. I shall deal with the subject as concerns  the speculations of the alchemists in some detail in a later excursion.      (1) BERNARD, Earl of TREVISAN: _A Treatise of the Philosopher's Stone_,  1683. (See _Collectanea Chymica: A Collection of Ten Several Treatises  in Chemistry_, 1684, p. 91.)          II. PYTHAGORAS AND HIS PHILOSOPHY    IT is a matter for enduring regret that so little is known to us  concerning PYTHAGORAS. What little we do know serves but to enhance  for us the interest of the man and his philosophy, to make him, in many  ways, the most attractive of Greek thinkers; and, basing our estimate  on the extent of his influence on the thought of succeeding ages, we  recognise in him one of the world's master-minds.    PYTHAGORAS was born about 582 B.C. at Samos, one of the Grecian isles.  In his youth he came in contact with THALES--the Father of Geometry,  as he is well called,--and though he did not become a member of THALES'  school, his contact with the latter no doubt helped to turn his mind  towards the study of geometry. This interest found the right ground for  its development in Egypt, which he visited when still young. Egypt is  generally regarded as the birthplace of geometry, the subject having, it  is supposed, been forced on the minds of the Egyptians by the necessity  of fixing the boundaries of lands against the annual overflowing of the  Nile. But the Egyptians were what is called an essentially practical  people, and their geometrical knowledge did not extend beyond a few  empirical rules useful for fixing these boundaries and in constructing  their temples. Striking evidence of this fact is supplied by the AHMES  papyrus, compiled some little time before 1700 B.C. from an older  work dating from about 3400 B.C.,(1) a papyrus which almost certainly  represents the highest mathematical knowledge reached by the Egyptians  of that day. Geometry is treated very superficially and as of subsidiary  interest to arithmetic; there is no ordered series of reasoned  geometrical propositions given--nothing, indeed, beyond isolated rules,  and of these some are wanting in accuracy.      (1) See AUGUST EISENLOHR: _Ein mathematisches Handbuch der alten  Aegypter_ (1877); J. Gow: _A Short History of Greek Mathematics_ (1884);  and V. E. JOHNSON: _Egyptian Science from the Monuments and Ancient  Books_ (1891).      One geometrical fact known to the Egyptians was that if a triangle be  constructed having its sides 3, 4, and 5 units long respectively, then  the angle opposite the longest side is exactly a right angle; and the  Egyptian builders used this rule for constructing walls perpendicular to  each other, employing a cord graduated in the required manner. The  Greek mind was not, however, satisfied with the bald statement of mere  facts--it cared little for practical applications, but sought above all  for the underlying REASON of everything. Nowadays we are beginning to  realise that the results achieved by this type of mind, the general laws  of Nature's behaviour formulated by its endeavours, are frequently  of immense practical importance--of far more importance than the mere  rules-of-thumb beyond which so-called practical minds never advance.  The classic example of the utility of seemingly useless knowledge is  afforded by Sir WILLIAM HAMILTON'S discovery, or, rather, invention of  Quarternions, but no better example of the utilitarian triumph of the  theoretical over the so-called practical mind can be adduced than that  afforded by PYTHAGORAS. Given this rule for constructing a right angle,  about whose reason the Egyptian who used it never bothered himself, and  the mind of PYTHAGORAS, searching for its full significance, made that  gigantic geometrical discovery which is to this day known as the Theorem  of PYTHAGORAS--the law that in every right-angled triangle the square  on the side opposite the right angle is equal in area to the sum of the  squares on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#2)"],[1,"lance and shield, jewel-hilted sword and slim  misericorde; while the Emperor himself might have been given the very suit  of armour stripped from the Duke of Clarence before his fateful encounter  with the butt of malmsey.    Did not even Shakespeare calmly give cannon to the Romans and suppose  every continental city to lie majestically beside the sea? By the old  writers, accuracy in these matters was disregarded, and anachronisms were  not so much tolerated as unperceived.    In illustrating this edition of \"The Legends of King Arthur and his  Knights,\" it has seemed best, and indeed unavoidable if the text and the  pictures are to tally, to draw what Malory describes, to place the fashion  of the costumes and armour somewhere about A.D. 1460, and to arm the  knights in accordance with the Tabard Period.    LANCELOT SPEED.          LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS      The Marriage of King Arthur    Then fell Sir Ector down upon his knees upon the ground before young  Arthur, and Sir Key also with him.    The Lady of the Lake    The giant sat at supper, gnawing on a limb of a man, and baking his huge  frame by the fire    The castle rocked and rove throughout, and all the walls fell crashed and  breaking to the earth    Came forth twelve fair damsels, and saluted King Arthur by his name    Prianius was christened, and made a duke and knight of the Round Table    Sir Lancelot smote down with one spear five knights, and brake the backs  of four, and cast down the King of Northgales    Beyond the chapel, he met a fair damsel, who said, \"Sir Lancelot, leave  that sword behind thee, or thou diest\"    \"Lady,\" replied Sir Beaumains, \"a knight is little worth who may not bear  with a damsel\"    So he rode into the hall and alighted    Then they began the battle, and tilted at their hardest against each other    And running to her chamber, she sought in her casket for the piece of  iron ... and fitted it in Tristram's sword    By the time they had finished drinking they loved each other so well that  their love never more might leave them    Waving her hands and muttering the charm, and presently enclosed him fast  within the tree    Galahad ... quickly lifted up the stone, and forthwith came out a foul  smoke    \"This girdle, lords,\" said she, \"is made for the most part of mine own  hair, which, while I was yet in the world, I loved full well\"    At last the strange knight smote him to the earth, and gave him such a  buffet on the helm as wellnigh killed him    Then was Sir Lancelot sent for, and the letter read aloud by a clerk    But still the knights cried mightily without the door, \"Traitor, come  forth!\"          THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR          CHAPTER I    _The Prophecies of Merlin, and the Birth of Arthur_      King Vortigern the usurper sat upon his throne in London, when, suddenly,  upon a certain day, ran in a breathless messenger, and cried aloud--    \"Arise, Lord King, for the enemy is come; even Ambrosius and Uther, upon  whose throne thou sittest--and full twenty thousand with them--and they  have sworn by a great oath, Lord, to slay thee, ere this year be done; and  even now they march towards thee as the north wind of winter for  bitterness and haste.\"    At those words Vortigern's face grew white as ashes, and, rising in  confusion and disorder, he sent for all the best artificers and craftsmen  and mechanics, and commanded them vehemently to go and build him  straightway in the furthest west of his lands a great and strong castle,  where he might fly for refuge and escape the vengeance of his master's  sons--\"and, moreover,\" cried he, \"let the work be done within a hundred  days from now, or I will surely spare no life amongst you all.\"    Then all the host of craftsmen, fearing for their lives, found out a  proper site whereon to build the tower, and eagerly began to lay in the  foundations. But no sooner were the walls raised up above the ground than  all their work was overwhelmed and broken down by night invisibly, no man  perceiving how, or by whom, or what. And the same thing happening again,  and yet again, all the workmen, full of terror, sought out the king, and  threw themselves upon their faces before him, beseeching him to interfere  and help them or to deliver them from their dreadful work.    Filled with mixed rage and fear, the king called for the astrologers and  wizards, and took counsel with them what these things might be, and how to  overcome them. The wizards worked their spells and incantations, and in  the end declared that nothing but the blood of a youth born without mortal  father, smeared on the foundations of the castle, could avail to make it  stand. Messengers were therefore sent forthwith through all the land to  find, if it were possible, such a child. And, as some of them went down a  certain village street, they saw a band of lads fighting and quarrelling,  and heard them shout at one--\"Avaunt, thou imp!--avaunt! Son of no mortal  man! go, find thy father, and leave us in peace.\"    At that the messengers looked steadfastly on the lad, and asked who he  was. One said his name was Merlin; another, that his birth and parentage  were known by no man; a third, that the foul fiend alone was his father.  Hearing the things, the officers seized Merlin, and carried him before the  king by force.    But no sooner was he brought to him than he asked in a loud voice, for  what cause he was thus dragged there?    \"My magicians,\" answered Vortigern, \"told me to seek out a man that had no  human father, and to sprinkle my castle with his blood, that it may  stand.\"    \"Order those magicians,\" said Merlin, \"to come before me, and I will  convict them of a lie.\"    The king was astonished at his words, but commanded the magicians to come  and sit down before Merlin, who cried to them--    \"Because ye know not what it is that hinders the foundation of the castle,  ye have advised my blood for a cement to it, as if that would avail; but  tell me now rather what there is below that ground, for something there is  surely underneath that will not suffer the tower to stand?\"    The wizards at these words began to fear, and made no answer. Then said  Merlin to the king--    \"I pray, Lord, that workmen may be ordered to dig deep down into the  ground till they shall come to a great pool of water.\"    This then was done, and the pool discovered far beneath the surface of the  ground.    Then, turning again to the magicians, Merlin said, \"Tell me now, false  sycophants, what there is underneath that pool?\"--but they were silent.  Then said he to the king, \"Command this pool to be drained, and at the  bottom shall be found two dragons, great and huge, which now are sleeping,  but which at night awake and fight and tear each other. At their great  struggle all the ground shakes and trembles, and so casts down thy towers,  which, therefore, never yet could find secure foundations.\"    The king was amazed at these words, but commanded the pool to be forthwith  drained; and surely at the bottom of it did they presently discover the  two dragons, fast asleep, as Merlin had declared.    But Vortigern sat upon the brink of the pool till night to see what else  would happen.    Then those two dragons, one of which was white, the other red, rose up and  came near one another, and began a sore fight, and cast forth fire with  their breath. But the white dragon had the advantage, and chased the other  to the end of the lake. And he, for grief at his flight, turned back upon  his foe, and renewed the combat, and forced him to retire in turn. But in  the end the red dragon was worsted, and the white dragon disappeared no  man knew where.    When their battle was done, the king desired Merlin to tell him what it  meant. Whereat he, bursting into tears, cried out this prophecy, which  first foretold the coming of King Arthur.    \"Woe to the red dragon, which figureth the British nation, for his  banishment cometh quickly; his lurkingholes shall be seized by the white  dragon--the Saxon whom thou, O king, hast called to the land. The  mountains shall be levelled as the valleys, and the rivers of the valleys  shall run blood; cities shall be burned, and churches laid in ruins; till  at length the oppressed shall turn for a season and prevail against the  strangers. For a Boar of Cornwall shall arise and rend them, and trample  their necks beneath his feet. The island shall be subject to his power,  and he shall take the forests of Gaul. The house of Romulus shall dread  him--all the world shall fear him--and his end shall no man know; he shall  be immortal in the mouths of the people, and his works shall be food to  those that tell them.    \"But as for thee, O Vortigern, flee thou the sons of Constantine, for they  shall burn thee in thy tower. For thine own ruin wast thou traitor to  their father, and didst bring the Saxon heathens to the land. Aurelius and  Uther are even now upon thee to revenge their father's murder; and the  brood of the white dragon shall waste thy country, and shall lick thy  blood. Find out some refuge, if thou wilt! but who may escape the doom of  God?\"    The king heard all this, trembling greatly; and, convicted of his sins,  said nothing in reply. Only he hasted the builders of his tower by day and  night, and rested not till he had fled thereto.    In the meantime, Aurelius, the rightful king, was hailed with joy by the  Britons, who flocked to his standard, and prayed to be led against the  Saxons. But he, till he had first killed Vortigern, would begin no other  war. He marched therefore to Cambria, and came before the tower which the  usurper had built. Then, crying out to all his knights, \"Avenge ye on him  who hath ruined Britain and slain my father and your king!\" he rushed with  many thousands at the castle walls. But, being driven back again and yet  again, at length he thought of fire, and ordered blazing brands to be cast  into the building from all sides. These"]]]
