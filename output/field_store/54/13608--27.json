'A rival may be good, but her son never: a rival  even if she be made of dough is intolerable: the malice of a rival is  known to everybody: wife upon wife and heartburnings'--such are the common  proverbs which define the situation. But if her separation from her  husband was really due to this cause, it is curious that in her book she  notes as a mark of a good wife that she is tolerant of such arrangements.  'She receives him [her husband] with undisguised pleasure, although she  has just before learned that another member has been added to his  well-peopled harem. The good and forbearing wife, by this line of conduct,  secures to herself the confidence of her husband, who, feeling assured  that the amiable woman has an interest in his happiness, will consult her  and take her advice in the domestic affairs of his children by other wives,  and even arrange by her judgement all the settlements for their marriages,  &c. He can speak of other wives without restraint--for she knows he has  others--and her education has taught her that they deserve her respect in  proportion as they contribute to her husband's happiness.'[4]    It is certainly noticeable that she says very little about her husband  beyond calling him in a conventional way 'an excellent husband' and 'a  dutiful, affectionate son'. There is no indication that her husband  accompanied her on her undated visit to Delhi, when she was received in  audience by the King, Akbar II, and the Queen, who were then living in a  state of semi-poverty. She tells us that they 'both appeared, and  expressed themselves, highly gratified with the visit of an English lady,  who could explain herself in their language without embarrassment, or the  assistance of an interpreter, and who was the more interesting to them  from the circumstance of being the wife of a Syaad'.[5]    From inquiries made at Lucknow it has been ascertained that Mir  Hasan 'Ali had no children by his English wife. By one or more native  wives he had three children: a daughter, Fatimah Begam, who married a  certain Mir Sher 'Ali, of which marriage one or more descendants  are believed to be alive; and two sons, Mir Sayyid 'Ali or Miran  Sahib, said to have served the British Government as a Tahsildar,  whose grandson is now living at Lucknow, and Mir Sayyid Husain, who  became a Risaldar, or commander of a troop, in one of the Oudh  Irregular Cavalry Regiments. One of his descendants, Mir Agha 'Ali  Sahib, possesses some landed property which was probably acquired by  the Risaldar. After the annexation of Oudh Mir Hasan 'Ali is  said to have been paid a pension of Rs. 100 _per mensem_ till his death in  1863.    It is also worthy of remark that she carefully avoids any reference to the  palace intrigues and maladministration which prevailed in Oudh during the  reigns of Ghazi-ud-din Haidar and Nasir-ud-din Haidar, who  occupied the throne during her residence at Lucknow. She makes a vague  apology for the disorganized state of the country: 'Acts of oppression may  sometimes occur in Native States without the knowledge even, and much less  by the command of, the Sovereign ruler, since the good order of the  government mainly depends on the disposition of the Prime Minister for the  time being'[6]--a true remark, but no defence for the conduct of the weak  princes who did nothing to suppress corruption and save their subjects  from oppression.    Little is known of the history of Mrs. Mir Hasan 'Ali after her  arrival in England. It has been stated that she was attached in some  capacity to the household of the Princess Augusta, who died unmarried on  September 22, 1840.[7] This is probable, because the list of subscribers  to her book is headed by Queen Adelaide, the Princess Augusta, and other  ladies of the Royal Family. She must have been in good repute among  Anglo-Indians, because several well-known names appear in the list: H.T.  Colebrooke, G.C. Haughton, Mordaunt Ricketts and his wife, and Colonel J.  Tod.    The value of the book rests on the fact that it is a record of the  first-hand experiences of an English lady who occupied the exceptional  position of membership of a Musalman family. She tells us nothing of  her friends in Lucknow, but she had free access to the houses of  respectable Sayyids, and thus gained ample facilities for the study of the  manners and customs of Musalman families. Much of her information on  Islam was obtained from her husband and his father, both learned,  travelled gentlemen, and by them she was treated with a degree of  toleration unusual in a Shi'ah household, this sect being rigid and  often fanatical followers of Islam. She was allowed to retain a firm  belief in the Christian religion, and she tells us that Mir Haji  Shah delighted in conversing on religious topics, and that his happiest  time was spent in the quiet of night when his son translated to him the  Bible as she read it.[8]    Her picture of zenana life is obviously coloured by her frank admiration  for the people amongst whom she lived, who treated her with respect and  consideration. It is thus to some extent idyllic. At the same time, it may  be admitted that she was exceptionally fortunate in her friends. Her  sketch may be usefully compared with that of Mrs. Fanny Parks in her  charming book, _The Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque_.  Mrs. Parks had the advantage of having acquired a literary knowledge of  Hindustani, while Mrs. Mir Hasan 'Ali, to judge from the way in  which she transliterates native words, can have been able to speak little  more than a broken patois, knew little of grammar, and was probably unable  to read or write the Arabic character. Colonel Gardner, who had wide and  peculiar experience, said to Mrs. Parks: 'Nothing can exceed the quarrels  that go on in the zenana, or the complaints the begams make against each  other. A common complaint is \"Such a one has been practising witchcraft  against me\". If the husband make a present to one wife, if it be only a  basket of mangoes, he must make the same exactly to all the other wives to  keep the peace. A wife, when in a rage with her husband, if on account of  jealousy, often says, \"I wish I were married to a grass-cutter,\" i.e.  because a grass-cutter is so poor that he can only afford to have one  wife.'[9] Mrs. Parks from her own experience calls the zenana 'a place of  intrigue, and those who live within four walls cannot pursue a straight  path; how can it be otherwise, when so many conflicting passions are  called forth?'[10] She adds that 'Musalmani ladies generally forget  their learning when they grow up, or they neglect it. Everything that  passes without the four walls is repeated to them by their spies; never  was any place so full of intrigue, scandal, and chit-chat as a zenana.'[11]  When she visited the Delhi palace she remarks: 'As for beauty, in a whole  zenana there may be two or three handsome women, and all the rest  remarkably ugly.'[12] European officers at the present day have no  opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the conditions of zenana life;  but from the rumours that reach them they would probably accept the views  of Mrs. Parks in preference to those of Mrs. Mir Hasan 'Ali.    Though her opinions on the life of Musalman ladies is to some extent  open to criticism, and must be taken to apply only to the exceptional  society in which she moved, her account of the religious feasts and fasts,  the description of the marriage ceremonies and that of the surroundings of  a native household are trustworthy and valuable. Some errors, not of much  importance and probably largely due to her imperfect knowledge of the  language, have been corrected in the notes of the present edition. It must  also be understood that her knowledge of native life was confined to that  of the Musalmans, and she displays no accurate acquaintance with the  religion, life or customs of the Hindus. The account in the text displays  a bias in favour of the Shi'ah sect of Musalmans, as contrasted with  that of the Sunnis. For a more impartial study of the question the  reader is referred to Sir W. Muir, _Annals of the Early Caliphate, The  Caliphate_, and to Major R.D. Osborn, _Islam under the Khalifs of Baghdad_.      [1] Col. H.M. Vibart, _Addiscombe_, pp. 39, 41, 42.    [2] _Diwan_, chief agent, manager.    [3] p. 208.    [4] p. 182.    [5] p. 290.
