On another occasion the First-year class, after their studies in  Egyptian and Assyrian architecture, made a dozen or twenty  restorations of Solomon's Temple, according to the description in the  Book of Kings. The drawings they produced showed considerable  fertility of invention, especially in the designs for Jachin and Boaz,  and the whole series together seemed to be quite as creditable and as  reasonable as most of those which have from time to time been put  forth by the learned.    This practice in historical design we believe to be founded on sound  theoretical principles. To regard a work of art as far as possible  from the point-of-view of the artist is, indeed, the first principle  of fair and intelligent criticism. To foster the individuality and  personal initiative of a pupil by bringing authority to bear upon him  in a way of correction at the end of his task, and guidance and  suggestion at the beginning, rather than control during the course of  the work, is the first principle of intelligent teaching. Moreover,  the results, so far as we have gone, have justified the method. We  have, indeed, employed it hitherto mainly as a matter of experiment  when favorable circumstances have suggested it. But every year we use  it to a greater and greater extent, and it is gradually acquiring a  recognized place as an integral portion of our work.    (_To be continued_.)          Personal.      Of the many fortunate ones who have come back to a winter of work  after a summer abroad are Messrs. Claude F. Bragdon, Charles M.  Sutton, and Howard Hatton, of Rochester. Messrs. Sutton and Hatton are  now with J. Foster Warner. Mr. Bragdon has temporarily opened an  office at 60 Trust Building, but will have offices in the new Cutler  Building when completed.    Mr. Wilson Eyre, Jr., of Philadelphia, has just finished designing a  second formal garden, which is said to be delightfully un-American;  and Mr. Frank Miles Day's Horticultural Hall is nearly ready to  receive the mural coloring and allegorical painting which Mr. Joseph  Lindon Smith is to execute. The latter will be a conspicuous departure  from ordinarily accepted models.    [Illustration: LXXXIV.

We have no apology  to offer for this insistence upon the publisher's business, for it  concerns every one who has any interest in the undertaking, in so far  as the support received in this quarter will make it either possible  or impossible, as the case maybe, to add to the attractions of the  magazine as conducted at present.    We have every reason to feel satisfied with the support thus far  accorded us, for our subscription list is now much larger than we  expected it would be at this time, but this is only a beginning. In  the advertising pages of this number will be found an announcement  which, we trust, will appeal to a large number of our present  subscribers who already know our work. In most cases it is only  necessary to show the magazine and state the price to at once secure a  subscriber. Try it and see; enter the prize competition, and help  yourself by helping us.    In the September issue we took occasion to notice the mural decoration  and color treatment of the staircase hall of the new Public Library  Building in Boston. Those who would judge for themselves of the merits  of our conclusions must see the building; but it is not necessary to  go to Boston in order to realize that here we have a remarkably  beautiful structure, and many of its features can be fully enjoyed and  appreciated in photographic views. In another column will be found a  notice of a very attractive and unusually satisfactory handbook of the  library, with numerous illustrations from the photographs of Mr. E.E.  Soderholtz. Further than this, we wish to call particular attention to  the set of photographs which is advertised on the front cover of this  number. As a photographer of architectural subjects Mr. Soderholtz  certainly has no superior in this country, and in this collection the  subjects and manner of presentation are equally worthy of the highest  praise.          Wanted Draughtsmen's Addresses.      We intend issuing, the coming year, a number of interestingly  illustrated announcements of new architectural publications and  importations. We want to send these to every architectural student and  draughtsman in the United States and Canada. If you are not on our  subscription list, send us your _residence_ address for our circular  mailing list. Address a postal card as below, putting simply your  address on the back. If you are in an office, have the other fellows  put their residence addresses on the same card. We prefer to address  mail matter to your residence, as there is less danger of miscarriage.  Do not get the idea that by sending your address you are ordering  something you will be asked to pay for. All the expense, except the  postal card, is on our side. If we can't get out announcements  interesting enough to attract your attention and occasionally secure  an order, it will be our loss.

Andresse, Normandy.]          Brochure Series Competition No. 2.      The first lot of drawings in the competition for a design for the  advertising page of The Boynton Furnace Co., in THE BROCHURE SERIES,  was due on December 10, and eleven designs were received.    The judges have awarded the prize to Mr. Edwin R. Clark of Lowell,  Mass., and his design appears in this issue as the advertisement of  the Boynton Furnace Co., on page xi. The reasons for the award may be  a guide to others engaged in similar work, and consequently we  reproduce several of the other designs for comparison with Mr.  Clark's.    It must be remembered that the first consideration in this problem is  the effectiveness as advertising matter of the design submitted--its  artistic merits, although important, are distinctly secondary to this  quality. The medium in which it is to be used and the clientage to  which it is intended to appeal must also be constantly borne in mind.    [Illustration: Design by Edwin R. Clark.]    Mr. Clark submitted three drawings, a second one of which is given  herewith. The first is superior in giving a more positive effect to  the page and in being a more unusual treatment than the second.  Although both are drawn with skill and are admirable in technique, the  type of design and ornament used in the second have come into such  common use that if for no other reason than this the first would be  preferable.    [Illustration: Design by W.B. Olmsted.]    As decorative treatment Mr. Olmsted's design is in many respects the  most masterly of the lot, and if the personal choice of the judges had  been the only consideration upon which the award was to be made, this  would have been placed first, for it is remarkable for careful and  intelligent arrangement, subtle balancing and proportion of parts, and  especially for what may be called the decorative sense by which just  the right relation of black to white is preserved. It is seldom that  any but the most accomplished designers succeed in obtaining this just  proportion, which gives a sparkle to the design such as is seen in the  best of the Japanese stencil patterns used on printed stuffs. The  clever use of motives connected with the business advertised and the  idea of presenting the Boynton apparatus in attractive form and other  heaters thrown about in confusion is commendable. The only reason for  passing over this design in the award is the advertising value of the  attractive appearance of some of the more ornate designs.    [Illustration: LXXXVI. Manoir d'Ango, Normandy.]    One other drawing, that of Mr. Brown, deserves particular notice for  its intrinsic excellence. It is especially praiseworthy for its grace  of line and general arrangement. The figure is well placed and,  although faulty in drawing, is particularly effective in treatment. It  is essentially a poster design, but none the less appropriate for the  present purpose on this account. It lacks only in those qualities of  draughtsmanship which come with practice and experience.    [Illustration: Design by F. Chouteau Brown.]    The remaining drawing which we illustrate is a very interesting  although not especially forcible treatment of the class of ornament  adopted by Mr. Louis H. Sullivan, and in his hands having a wonderful  charm, but seldom used with entire success by others.    The result in this first series of designs is especially satisfactory  in the intelligence shown in grasping the essentials of the problem.  All of the remaining six drawings have points of excellence to commend  them, and if we had space to reproduce them would prove instructive in  showing the diversity of treatment possible "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15040"],[0,"McGuffey's Fifth Eclectic Reader (#2)"],[1,"          Alexander Pope.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS.    The great object to be accomplished in reading, as a rhetorical exercise,  is to convey to the hearer, fully and clearly, the ideas and feelings of  the writer.    In order to do this, it is necessary that a selection should be carefully  studied by the pupil before he attempts to read it. In accordance with  this view, a preliminary rule of importance is the following:    RULE 1.--Before attempting to read a lesson, the learner should make  himself fully acquainted with the subject as treated of in that lesson,  and endeavor to make the thought and feeling and sentiments of the writer  his own.    REMARK.--When he has thus identified himself with the author, he has the  substance of all rules in his own mind. It is by going to nature that we  find rules. The child or the savage orator never mistakes in inflection or  emphasis or modulation. The best speakers and readers are those who follow  the impulse of nature, or most closely imitate it as observed in others.    II. ARTICULATION.    Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and  of their combinations.    An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of  speech.    The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,  Subvocals, and Aspirates.    ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.--VOCALS.    Vocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. A diphthong is a union  of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other.    DIRECTION.--Put the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper  position; pronounce the word in the chart forcibly, and with the falling  inflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or  aspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals  alone.    Table of Vocals.                Long Vocals.  Vocal   as in      Vocal   as in  -----   -----      -----   -----  a       hate         e     err  a       hare         i     pine  a       far          o     no  a       pass         u     tube  a       fall         u     burn  e       eve         oo     cool                Short Vocals  Vocal   as in      Vocal   as in  -----   -----      -----   -----  a       mat          o     hot  e       met          u     us  i       it          oo     book        Diphthongs.  Vocal     as in  ------   --------  oi, oy   oil, boy  ou, ow   out,now    REMARK 1.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite  the same in quality as certain of the long sounds. The difference consists  chiefly in quantity.    REMARK 2. The vocals are often represented by other letters or  combinations of letters than those used in the table; for instance, a is  represented by ai in hail, ea in steak, etc.    REMARK 3.--As a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be  articulated with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a  sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance.        SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.    Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less  obstructed.    Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.    Words ending with subvocal sounds should be selected for practice on the  subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for  practice on the aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly  several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the  subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and elements  at first in concert, then separately.    Table of Subvocals and Aspirates.  Subvocal   as in          Subvocal   as in  --------   -----          --------   -----  b          babe              p       rap  d          bad               t       at  g          nag               k       book  j          judge             ch      rich  v          move              f       life  th         with              th      Smith  z          buzz              s       hiss  z          azure(azh'ure)    sh      rush        REMARK.--These sixteen sounds make eight pairs of cognates. In  articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position  required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the  breath is expelled with some force without the utterance of any vocal  sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice  on these cognates.    The following subvocals and aspirates have no cognates.     SUBVOCALS.    Subvocal   as in      Subvocal   as in  --------   -----      --------   -----  l          mill         r        rule  m          rim          r        car  n          run          w        win  ng         sing         y        yet    ASPIRATES    Aspirate   as in  --------   -----  h          hat  wh         when        SUBSTITUTES.    Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented  by other characters.    TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.

DIRECTION.--Give to each sound, to each syllable, and to each word its  full, distinct, and appropriate utterance.    For the purpose of avoiding the more common errors under this head,  observe the following rules:    RULE II.--Avoid the omission of unaccented vowels.    EXAMPLES.    Incorrect      Correct            Incorrect      Correct  ---------      -----------        ----------     ---------  Sep'rate       sep-a-rate         Ev'dent        ev-i-dent  met-ric'l      met-ric-al         mem'ry         mem-o-ry  'pear          ap-pear            'pin-ion       o-pin-ion  com-p'tent     com-pe-tent        pr'pose        pro-pose  pr'cede        pre-cede           gran'lar       gran-u-lar  'spe-cial      es-pe-cial         par-tic'lar    par-tic-u-lar        RULE III.--Avoid sounding incorrectly the unaccented vowels.    EXAMPLES.    Incorrect       Correct            Incorrect       Correct  ----------      -----------        ------------    ------------  Sep-er-ate      sep-a-rate         Mem-er-ry       mem-o-ry  met-ric-ul      met-ric-al         up-pin-ion      o-pin-ion  up-pear         ap-pear            prup-ose        pro-pose  com-per-tent    com-pe-tent        gran-ny-lar     gran-u-lar  dum-mand        de-mand            par-tic-e-lar   par-tic-u-lar  ob-stur-nate    ob-sti-nate        ev-er-dent      ev-i-dent      REMARK I.--In correcting errors of this kind in words of more than one  syllable, it is very important to avoid a fault which is the natural  consequence of an effort to articulate correctly. Thus, in endeavoring to  sound correctly the a in met'ric-al, the pupil is very apt to say  met-ric-al'. accenting the last syllable instead of the first.    REMARK 2.--The teacher should bear it in mind that in correcting a fault  there is always danger of erring in the opposite extreme. Properly  speaking, there is no danger of learning to articulate too distinctly, but  there is danger of making the obscure sounds too prominent, and of reading  in a slow, measured, and unnatural manner.    RULE IV.--Utter distinctly the terminating subvocals and aspirates.    EXAMPLES.    Incorrect     Correct      Incorrect     Correct  ---------     -------      ---------     -------  An'           and          Mos'          mosque  ban'          band         near-es'      near-est  moun'         mound        wep'          wept  mor-nin'      morn-ing     ob-jec'       ob-ject  des'          desk         sub-jec       sub-ject      REMARK 1.--This omission is still more likely to occur when several  consonants come together.      EXAMPLES.    Incorrect     Correct          Incorrect      Correct  ---------     --------         ---------      ----------  Thrus'        thrusts          Harms'         harm'st  beace         beasts           wrongs'        wrong'st  thinks'       thinkst          twinkles'      twinkl'dst  weps'         weptst           black'ns       black'n'dst      REMARK 2.--In all cases of this kind these sounds are omitted, in the  first instance, merely because they are difficult, and require care and  attention for their utterance, although after a while it becomes a habit.  The only remedy is to devote that care and attention which may be  necessary. There is no other difficulty, unless there should be a defect  in the organs of speech, which is not often the case.    RULE V.--A void blending syllables which belong to different words.    EXAMPLES.    INCORRECT.            CORRECT.  ----------            ------------  He ga-zdupon.         He gazed upon.  Here res tsis sed.    Here rests his head.  Whattis sis sname?    What is his name?  For ranninstantush.   For an instant hush.  Ther ris sa calm,     There is a calm.  For tho stha tweep.
