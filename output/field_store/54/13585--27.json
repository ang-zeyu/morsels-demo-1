You will catch cold outside. I will go and call a cab.\"    But she did not listen to him, and rapidly descended the stairs. When  they were in the street they did not find a carriage; and they began to  look for one, shouting after the cabmen whom they saw passing by at a  distance.    They went down toward the Seine, in despair, shivering with cold. At  last they found on the quay one of those ancient noctambulent coupes  which, exactly as if they were ashamed to show their misery during the  day, are never seen round Paris until after nightfall.    It took them to their door in the Rue des Martyrs, and once more,  sadly, they climbed up homeward. All was ended for her. And as to him,  he reflected that he must be at the Ministry at ten o'clock.    She removed the wraps, which covered her shoulders, before the glass,  so as once more to see herself in all her glory. But suddenly she  uttered a cry. She had no longer the necklace around her neck!    Her husband, already half undressed, demanded:    \"What is the matter with you?\"    She turned madly toward him:    \"I have--I have--I've lost Mme. Forestier's necklace.\"    He stood up, distracted.    \"What!--how?--Impossible!\"    And they looked in the folds of her dress, in the folds of her cloak,  in her pockets, everywhere. They did not find it.    He asked:    \"You're sure you had it on when you left the ball?\"    \"Yes, I felt it in the vestibule of the palace.\"    \"But if you had lost it in the street we should have heard it fall. It  must be in the cab.\"    \"Yes. Probably. Did you take his number?\"    \"No. And you, didn't you notice it?\"    \"No.\"    They looked, thunderstruck, at one another. At last Loisel put on his  clothes.    \"I shall go back on foot,\" said he, \"over the whole route which we have  taken, to see if I can't find it.\"    And he went out. She sat waiting on a chair in her ball dress, without  strength to go to bed, overwhelmed, without fire, without a thought.    Her husband came back about seven o'clock. He had found nothing.    He went to Police Headquarters, to the newspaper offices, to offer a  reward; he went to the cab companies--everywhere, in fact, whither he  was urged by the least suspicion of hope.    She waited all day, in the same condition of mad fear before this  terrible calamity.    Loisel returned at night with a hollow, pale face; he had discovered  nothing.    \"You must write to your friend,\" said he, \"that you have broken the  clasp of her necklace and that you are having it mended. That will give  us time to turn round.\"    She wrote at his dictation.    At the end of a week they had lost all hope.    And Loisel, who had aged five years, declared:    \"We must consider how to replace that ornament.\"    The next day they took the box which had contained it, and they went to  the jeweler whose name was found within. He consulted his books.    \"It was not I, madame, who sold that necklace; I must simply have  furnished the case.\"    Then they went from jeweler to jeweler, searching for a necklace like  the other, consulting their memories, sick both of them with chagrin  and with anguish.    They found, in a shop at the Palais Royal, a string of diamonds which  seemed to them exactly like the one they looked for. It was worth forty  thousand francs. They could have it for thirty-six.    So they begged the jeweler not to sell it for three days yet. And they  made a bargain that he should buy it back for thirty-four thousand  francs in case they found the other one before the end of February.    Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left  him. He would borrow the rest.    He did borrow, asking a thousand francs of one, five hundred of  another, five louis here, three louis there. He gave notes, took up  ruinous obligations, dealt with usurers, and all the race of lenders.  He compromised all the rest of his life, risked his signature without  even knowing if he could meet it; and, frightened by the pains yet to  come, by the black misery which was about to fall upon him, by the  prospect of all the physical privations and of all the moral tortures  which he was to suffer, he went to get the new necklace, putting down  upon the merchant's counter thirty-six thousand francs.    When Mme. Loisel took back the necklace, Mme. Forestier said to her,  with a chilly manner:    \"You should have returned it sooner, I might have needed it.\"    She did not open the case, as her friend had so much feared. If she had  detected the substitution, what would she have thought, what would she  have said? Would she not have taken Mme. Loisel for a thief?    Mme. Loisel now knew the horrible existence of the needy. She took her  part, moreover, all on a sudden, with heroism. That dreadful debt must  be paid. She would pay it. They dismissed their servant; they changed  their lodgings; they rented a garret under the roof.    She came to know what heavy housework meant and the odious cares of the  kitchen. She washed the dishes, using her rosy nails on the greasy pots  and pans. She washed the dirty linen, the shirts, and the dish-cloths,  which she dried upon a line; she carried the slops down to the street  every morning, and carried up the water, stopping for breath at every  landing. And, dressed like a woman of the people, she went to the  fruiterer, the grocer, the butcher, her basket on her arm, bargaining,  insulted, defending her miserable money sou by sou.    Each month they had to meet some notes, renew others, obtain more time.    Her husband worked in the evening making a fair copy of some  tradesman's accounts, and late at night he often copied manuscript for  five sous a page.    And this life lasted ten years.    At the end of ten years they had paid everything, everything, with the  rates of usury, and the accumulations of the compound interest.    Mme. Loisel looked old now. She had become the woman of impoverished  households--strong and hard and rough. With frowsy hair, skirts askew,  and red hands, she talked loud while washing the floor with great  swishes of water. But sometimes, when her husband was at the office,  she sat down near the window, and she thought of that gay evening of  long ago, of that ball where she had been so beautiful and so feted.    What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace? Who knows?  who knows? How life is strange and changeful! How little a thing is  needed for us to be lost or to be saved!    But, one Sunday, having gone to take a walk in the Champs Elysees to  refresh herself from the labors of the week, she suddenly perceived a  woman who was leading a child. It was Mme. Forestier, still young,  still beautiful, still charming.    Mme. Loisel felt moved. Was she going to speak to her? Yes, certainly.  And now that she had paid, she was going to tell her all about it. Why  not?    She went up.    \"Good day, Jeanne.\"    The other, astonished to be familiarly addressed by this plain  good-wife, did not recognize her at all, and stammered:    \"But--madame!--I do not know--You must have mistaken.\"    \"No. I am Mathilde Loisel.\"    Her friend uttered a cry.    \"Oh, my poor Mathilde! How you are changed!\"    \"Yes, I have had days hard enough, since I have seen you, days wretched  enough--and that because of you!\"    \"Of me! How so?\"    \"Do you remember that diamond necklace which you lent me to wear at the  ministerial ball?\"    \"Yes. Well?\"    \"Well, I lost it.\"    \"What do you mean? You brought it back.\"    \"I brought you back another just like it. And for this we have been ten  years paying. You can understand that it was not easy for us, us who  had nothing. At last it is ended, and I am very glad.\"    Mme. Forestier had stopped.    \"You say that you bought a necklace of diamonds to replace mine?\"    \"Yes. You never noticed it, then! They were very like.\"    And she smiled with a joy which was proud and naive at once.    Mme. Forestier, strongly moved, took her two hands.    \"Oh, my poor Mathilde! Why, my necklace was paste. It was worth at most  five hundred francs!\"        _The Man with the Pale Eyes_      Monsieur Pierre Agenor De Vargnes, the Examining Magistrate, was the  exact opposite of a practical joker. He was dignity, staidness,  correctness personified. As a sedate man, he was quite incapable of  being guilty, even in his dreams, of anything resembling a practical  joke, however remotely. I know nobody to whom he could be compared,  unless it be the present president of the French Republic. I think it  is useless to carry the analogy any further, and having said thus much,  it will be easily understood that a cold shiver passed through me when  Monsieur Pierre Agenor de Vargnes did me the honor of sending a lady to  await on me.    At about eight o'clock, one morning last winter, as he was leaving the  house to go to the _Palais de Justice_, his footman handed him a card,  on which was printed:        DOCTOR JAMES FERDINAND,      _Member of the Academy of Medicine,      Port-au-Prince,      Chevalier of the Legion of Honor._    At the bottom of the card there was written in pencil:        _From Lady Frogere._    Monsieur de Vargnes knew the lady very well, who was a very agreeable  Creole from Hayti, and whom he had met in many drawing-rooms, and, on  the other hand, though the doctor's name did not awaken any  recollections in him, his quality and titles alone required that he  should grant him an interview, however short it might be. Therefore,  although he was in a hurry to get out, Monsieur de Vargnes told the  footman to show in his early visitor, but to tell him beforehand that  his master was much pressed for time, as he had to go to the Law  Courts.    When the doctor came in, in spite of his usual imperturbability, he  could not restrain a movement of surprise, for the doctor presented  that strange anomaly of being a negro of the purest, blackest type,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#2)"],[1,"go up for their examinations.\"    \"We've had our academic examinations, and have passed,\" announced  Dan.    \"What about supper, sir?\" asked Dave, who, in his short trip through  the South, had noticed that in this part of the country the \"sir\"  is generally employed.    \"You'll find supper ready, gentlemen,\" replied the clerk, pointing  the way to the dining room.    So the two young men passed in and enjoyed their first sample of  southern cookery.    At this hour there were only a half dozen other people in the  dining room--none of them interesting, Darrin decided, after  hastily surveying the other diners.    The meal over, the two young candidates sauntered again out into  the hotel office.    \"Any midshipmen out around the town, sir?\" Darrin asked.    \"Hardly, sir,\" replied the clerk, with a smile.  \"At this hour  the young gentlemen are in their rooms at Bancroft Hall.\"    \"What does a midshipman look like?\" ventured Dalzell.    \"Like a human being, of course,\" Dave laughed.    \"You mean the uniform?\" inquired the clerk. \"A midshipman, sir,  wears a dark blue uniform, like an officer's, and a visored cap,  Naval pattern.  He also wears the anchor insignia on each side  of his coat collar.\"    Dave and Dan soon walked over to the open doorway and stood looking  out upon the street, in which, at this time, few people were passing.  Hearing a step in the office, Dan quickly turned.  He saw  a young man coming through the office, holding himself very erect.  This young man was in dark blue uniform, with visored cap, and  on each side of his collar was the anchor insignia.  Past the  anchor were two bars, but Dalzell didn't notice that at the moment.    \"There's a real midshipman,\" whispered Dan, plucking at Dave's  sleeve.  \"I'm going to speak to him.\"    \"Don't you do it,\" warned Dave, in an undertone.  \"You may make  a mistake.\"    \"Mistake?\" echoed Dan.  \"With that anchor on his collar?\"    Hastily Dan Dalzell slipped back into the office, going up to  the young man in uniform, who had stopped before the desk.    \"Good evening,\" began Dan politely.  \"I'd like to introduce myself.  'Tomorrow I expect to be one of the crowd.  You're a midshipman,  aren't you?\"    \"I'm an officer of the Navy,\" replied the uniformed stranger coldly,  as he half turned to glance briefly at Dalzell.  \"You are a candidate,  I suppose?  Then I fancy you will report at the superintendent's  office in the morning.\"    With that the Naval officer turned away, leaving poor Dalzell  feeling decidedly dumfounded.    \"Wasn't that a midshipman?\" gasped Dan, in a whisper.    \"That gentleman is a lieutenant in the Navy,\" replied the clerk,  with a slight smile.    Crestfallen Dan hurried back to Darrin, brushing off his sleeves  with his hands as he walked.    \"Served you right; you must get over being fresh,\" Dave Darrin  rebuked his chum.  \"But what is the matter with your sleeves?\"    \"I'm brushing the frost off of them,\" murmured Dan dejectedly.  \"Did you notice the ice-bath that fellow threw over me?\"    \"Come out for a walk,\" urged Dave.  \"But be careful where you  step and what you say to others.\"    The two young men strolled down the street.    \"Well,\" smiled Darrin, \"I must say, Dan, that you appear to be  getting all over your nervousness.\"    \"No; I'm still nervous,\" protested Dan.  \"Before, I was afraid  I wouldn't get into the Naval Academy.  Now, I'm only afraid that  I shall.\"    \"What nonsense are you talking now?\" demanded Darrin, giving his  chum a sharp look.    \"Why, if they're all going to be as chesty as that near-officer I  spoke to in the hotel,\" blinked Dan, \"I'm not so sure that I want to  go in with the bunch.\"    \"That officer wasn't either chesty or snobbish,\" rejoined Darrin.    \"Then you will kindly explain what he tried to do to me?\"    \"That's easy enough.  That Naval officer recognized in you a rather  common type--the too-chummy and rather fresh American boy.  Down  here in the service, where different grades in rank exist, it is  necessary to keep the fresh greenhorn in his place.\"    \"Oh!\" muttered Dan, blinking hard.    \"As to your not wanting to go into the service,\" Dave continued,  \"if you should fail, tomorrow, in your physical examination, you  would be as blue as indigo, and have the blue-light signal up  all the way back home.\"    \"I don't know but that is so.  Yes; I guess it is,\" Dalzell assented.    \"Now, there are at least ninety-nine chances in a hundred that  you're going to pass the Navy doctors all right, Dan,\" his chum  went on.  \"If you do, you'll be sworn into the Naval service as  a midshipman.  Then you'll have to keep in mind that you're not  an admiral, but only a midshipman--on probation, at that, as  our instructions from the Navy Department inform us.  Now, as  a new midshipman, you're only the smallest, greenest little boy  in the whole service.  Just remember that, and drop all your jolly,  all your freshness and all your patronizing ways.  Just listen  and learn, Dan, and study, all the time, how to avoid being fresh.  If you don't do this, I'm mighty confident that you're up against  a hard and tough time, and that you'll have most of the other  midshipmen down on you from the start.\"    \"Any more 'roast' for me?\" asked Dalzell plaintively.    \"No; for, if you need any more, you'll get it from other midshipmen,  who don't know you as well as I do, and who won't make any allowances  for your greenness and freshness.\"    \"My!\" murmured Dan enthusiastically.  \"Won't I quiver with glee  the first time I see you being called for twelve-inch freshness!\"    Yet, despite their wordy encounters, the two remained, as always,  the best and most loyal of friends.    For an hour and a half the two youngsters roamed about Annapolis,  taking many interested looks at quaint old buildings that had  stood since long before the Revolutionary War.    At last they turned back to the hotel, for, as Dalzell suggested,  they needed a long night's sleep as a good preparation for going  before the Naval surgeons on the next day.    Five minutes after they had turned out the gas Dave Darrin was  soundly, blissfully asleep.    In another bed in the same room Dan Dalzell tossed for fully  half an hour ere sleep caught his eyelids and pinned them down.  In his slumber, however, Dan dreamed that he was confronting  the superintendent of the Naval Academy and a group of officers,  to whom he was expounding the fact that he was right and they  were wrong.  What the argument was about Dan didn't see clearly,  in his dream, but he had the satisfaction of making the  superintendent and most of the Naval officers with him feel like a  lot of justly-rebuked landsmen.          CHAPTER II    THE FIRST DAY AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY      A few minutes before nine o'clock, the next morning, Dave and  Dan were strolling through Lover's Lane, not far from the  administration building at the United States Naval Academy.    Their instructions bade them report at 9.15.  Dan was for going  in at once and \"calling on\" the aide to the superintendent.  But  this Dave vetoed, holding that the best thing for them to do was  to stick to the very letter of their orders.    So, as they waited, the young men got a glimpse of the imposing piles  of buildings that compose the newer Naval Academy.  Especially did  handsome, big, white Bancroft Hall enchain their admiration.  This  structure is one of the noblest in the country.  In it are the  midshipmen's mess, the midshipmen's barracks for a thousand young  men, numerous offices and a huge recreation hall.    \"That's a swell hotel where they're going to put us up for four  years, isn't it?\" demanded Dan.    \"I fancy that we'll find it something more--or less--than a  hotel, before we're through it,\" was Dave's prophetic reply.    As, at this time in the morning, all of the enrolled midshipmen  were away at one form or another of drill or instruction, the  central grounds were so empty of human life that the onlooker  could form no idea of the immense, throbbing activity that was  going on here among the hundreds of midshipmen on duty.    \"Here's some of our kind,\" spoke Dan, at last, as he espied more  than a dozen young men, in citizen's dress, strolling along under  the trees.    \"I guess they're candidates, fast enough,\" nodded Darrin, after  briefly looking at the approaching group.    \"Cheap-looking lot, most of them, aren't they?\" asked Dalzell  cheerfully.    \"Probably they're saying the same thing about us,\" chuckled Dave  dryly.    \"Let 'em, then.  Who cares?\" muttered Dalzell.    \"Dan, my boy, I reckon you'll need to put the soft pedal on your  critical tendencies,\" warned Dave.  \"And, if you want my friendly  opinion, I've a big idea that you're going to talk your way into  a lot of trouble here.\"    \"Trouble?\" grinned Dalzell.  \"Well, I'm used to it.\"    In truth Dan had been victor in many a hard-fought schoolboy  disagreement, as readers of the High School Boys Series are aware.    As the young men in question drew nearer they eyed Darrin and  Dalzell with a disapproval that was not wholly concealed.  The  truth was that Dave and Dan were recognized as not being boys  who had studied at one of the Naval prep. schools in Annapolis.  The assumption was, therefore, that Dave and Dan had not been  able to afford such a luxury.    \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" was Dave's pleasant greeting.  \"You  are candidates, like ourselves, I take it?\"    This fact being acknowledged, Dave introduced himself and his  friend, and soon some pleasant new acquaintances were being formed,  for Darrin had a way that always made him popular with strangers.    \"Have you two got to go up before the June exams. here?\" asked  one of the young men, who had introduced himself as Grigsby.    \"Part of it,\" grinned Dan.  \"We've already gone through the primer  tests and the catechism, and that sort of thing; but we still  have to go before the barber and the toilet specialists and see  whether our"]]]
