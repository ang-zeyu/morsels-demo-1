[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12122"],[0,"The Monkey's Paw (#2)"],[1,"table he laughed at his fears.  There was an air of prosaic  wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night,  and the dirty, shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a  carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.    \"I suppose all old soldiers are the same,\" said Mrs. White.  \"The idea of  our listening to such nonsense!  How could wishes be granted in these  days?  And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?\"    \"Might drop on his head from the sky,\" said the frivolous Herbert.    \"Morris said the things happened so naturally,\" said his father, \"that  you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.\"    \"Well, don't break into the money before I come back,\" said Herbert as he  rose from the table.  \"I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious  man, and we shall have to disown you.\"    His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the  road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense  of her husband's credulity.  All of which did not prevent her from  scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from  referring somewhat shortly to retired sergeant-majors of bibulous habits  when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.    \"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he  comes home,\" she said, as they sat at dinner.    \"I dare say,\" said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; \"but for all  that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to.\"    \"You thought it did,\" said the old lady soothingly.    \"I say it did,\" replied the other.  \"There was no thought about it; I had  just---- What's the matter?\"    His wife made no reply.  She was watching the mysterious movements of a  man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared  to be trying to make up his mind to enter.  In mental connection with the  two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and  wore a silk hat of glossy newness.  Three times he paused at the gate,  and then walked on again.  The fourth time he stood with his hand upon  it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path.  Mrs. White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly  unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel  beneath the cushion of her chair.    She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room.  He  gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old  lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat, a  garment which he usually reserved for the garden.  She then waited as  patiently as her sex would permit, for him to broach his business, but he  was at first strangely silent.    \"I--was asked to call,\" he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece  of cotton from his trousers.  \"I come from 'Maw and Meggins.'\"    The old lady started.  \"Is anything the matter?\"  she asked,  breathlessly.  \"Has anything happened to Herbert?  What is it?  What is  it?\"    Her husband interposed.  \"There, there, mother,\" he said, hastily.  \"Sit  down, and don't jump to conclusions.  You've not brought bad news, I'm  sure, sir;\" and he eyed the other wistfully.    \"I'm sorry--\" began the visitor.    \"Is he hurt?\"  demanded the mother, wildly.    The visitor bowed in assent.  \"Badly hurt,\" he said, quietly, \"but he is  not in any pain.\"    \"Oh, thank God!\" said the old woman, clasping her hands.  \"Thank God for  that!  Thank--\"    She broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned  upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other's  averted face.  She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted  husband, laid her trembling old hand upon his.  There was a long silence.    \"He was caught in the machinery,\" said the visitor at length in a low  voice.    \"Caught in the machinery,\" repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion, \"yes.\"    He sat staring blankly out at the window, and taking his wife's hand  between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old  courting-days nearly forty years before.    \"He was the only one left to us,\" he said, turning gently to the visitor.  \"It is hard.\"    The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window.  \"The firm  wished me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,\"  he said, without looking round.  \"I beg that you will understand I am  only their servant and merely obeying orders.\"    There was no reply; the old woman's face was white, her eyes staring, and  her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend  the sergeant might have carried into his first action.    \"I was to say that 'Maw and Meggins' disclaim all responsibility,\"  continued the other.  \"They admit no liability at all, but in  consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with  a certain sum as compensation.\"    Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a  look of horror at his visitor.  His dry lips shaped the words, \"How  much?\"    \"Two hundred pounds,\" was the answer.    Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his  hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.      III.    In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried  their dead, and came back to a house steeped in shadow and silence.  It  was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and  remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen  --something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts  to bear.    But the days passed, and expectation gave place to resignation--the  hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled, apathy.  Sometimes  they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and  their days were long to weariness.    It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night,  stretched out his hand and found himself alone.  The room was in  darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window.  He  raised himself in bed and listened.    \"Come back,\" he said, tenderly.  \"You will be cold.\"    \"It is colder for my son,\" said the old woman, and wept afresh.    The sound of her sobs died away on his ears.  The bed was warm, and his  eyes heavy with sleep.  He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden  wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.    \"The paw!\"  she cried wildly.  \"The monkey's paw!\"    He started up in alarm.  \"Where?  Where is it?  What's the matter?\"    She came stumbling across the room toward him.  \"I want it,\" she said,  quietly.  \"You've not destroyed it?\"    \"It's in the parlour, on the bracket,\" he replied, marvelling.  \"Why?\"    She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.    \"I only just thought of it,\" she said, hysterically.  \"Why didn't I think  of it before?  Why didn't you think of it?\"    \"Think of what?\"  he questioned.    \"The other two wishes,\" she replied, rapidly. \"We've only had one.\"    \"Was not that enough?\"  he demanded, fiercely.    \"No,\" she cried, triumphantly; \"we'll have one more.  Go down and get it  quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\"    The man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs.  \"Good God, you are mad!\"  he cried, aghast.    \"Get it,\" she panted; \"get it quickly, and wish--Oh, my boy, my boy!\"    Her husband struck a match and lit the candle.  \"Get back to bed,\" he  said, unsteadily.  \"You don't know what you are saying.\"    \"We had the first wish granted,\" said the old woman, feverishly; \"why not  the second?\"    \"A coincidence,\" stammered the old man.    \"Go and get it and wish,\" cried his wife, quivering with excitement.    The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook.  \"He has been  dead ten days, and besides he--I would not tell you else, but--I could  only recognize him by his clothing.  If he was too terrible for you to  see then, how now?\"    \"Bring him back,\" cried the old woman, and dragged him toward the door.  \"Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?\"    He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then  to the mantelpiece.  The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear  that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he  could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as  he found that he had lost the direction of the door.  His brow cold with  sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until  he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his  hand.    Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room.  It was white  and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it.  He was afraid of her.    \"Wish!\"  she cried, in a strong voice.    \"It is foolish and wicked,\" he faltered.    \"Wish!\"  repeated his wife.    He raised his hand.  \"I wish my son alive again.\"    The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully.  Then he  sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked  to the window and raised the blind.    He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the  figure of the old woman peering through the window.  The candle-end,  which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing  pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until, with a flicker larger  than the rest, it expired.  The old man, with an unspeakable sense of  relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a  minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically  beside him.    Neither spoke, but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock.  A  stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall.  The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1216"],[0,"Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes (#2)"],[1,"most severe; and the assertion was the more likely to be  credited, from the fact of my having spoken a few words connected with  one of those subjects at the last anniversary of the Royal Society.  [I merely observed that the agreement made with the British Museum for  exchanging the Arundel MSS. for their duplicates, (which had just been  stated by the President,) was UNWISE;--because it was not to be expected  that many duplicates should be found in a library like that of the  Museum, weak in the physical and mathematical sciences: that it was  IMPROVIDENT and UNBUSINESSLIKE;--because it neither fixed the TIME  when the difference was to be paid, in case their duplicates should be  insufficient; nor did it appear that there were any FUNDS out of  which the money could be procured: and I added, that it would be more  advantageous to sell the MSS., and purchase the books we wanted with the  produce.] I had hoped in that diminutive world, the world of science, my  character had been sufficiently known to have escaped being the subject  of such a mistake; and, in taking this opportunity of correcting it, I  will add that, in the present volume, I have thought it more candid to  mention distinctly those whose line of conduct I have disapproved, or  whose works I have criticised, than to leave to the reader inferences  which he might make far more extensive than I have intended. I hope,  therefore, that where I have depicted species, no person will be so  unkind to others and unjust to me, as to suppose I have described  individuals.    With respect to the cry against personality, which has been lately set  up to prevent all inquiry into matters of scientific misgovernment, a  few words will suffice.    I feel as strongly as any one, not merely the impropriety, but the  injustice of introducing private character into such discussions. There  is, however, a maxim too well established to need any comment of mine.  The public character of every public servant is legitimate subject  of discussion, and his fitness or unfitness for office may be fairly  canvassed by any person. Those whose too sensitive feelings shrink from  such an ordeal, have no right to accept the emoluments of office, for  they know that it is the condition to which all must submit who are paid  from the public purse.    The same principle is equally applicable to Companies, to Societies, and  to Academies. Those from whose pocket the salary is drawn, and by whose  appointment the officer was made, have always a right to discuss the  merits of their officers, and their modes of exercising the duties they  are paid to perform.    This principle is equally applicable to the conduct of a Secretary of  State, or to that of a constable; to that of a Secretary of the Royal  Society, or of an adviser to the Admiralty.    With respect to honorary officers, the case is in some measure  different. But the President of a society, although not recompensed by  any pecuniary remuneration, enjoys a station, when the body over which  he presides possesses a high character, to which many will aspire, who  will esteem themselves amply repaid for the time they devote to the  office, by the consequence attached to it in public estimation. He,  therefore, is answerable to the Society for his conduct in their chair.    There are several societies in which the secretaries, and other  officers, have very laborious duties, and where they are unaided by a  train of clerks, and yet no pecuniary remuneration is given to them.  Science is much indebted to such men, by whose quiet and unostentatious  labours the routine of its institutions is carried on. It would be  unwise, as well as ungrateful, to judge severely of the inadvertencies,  or even of the negligence of such persons: nothing but weighty causes  should justify such a course.    Whilst, however, I contend for the principle of discussion and inquiry  in its widest sense, because I consider it equally the safeguard of our  scientific as of our political institutions, I shall use it, I hope,  temperately; and having no personal feelings myself, but living in terms  of intercourse with almost all, and of intimacy with several of those  from whom I most widely differ, I shall not attempt to heap together  all the causes of complaint; but, by selecting a few in different  departments, endeavour to convince them that some alteration is  essentially necessary for the promotion of that very object which we  both by such different roads pursue.    I have found it necessary, in the course of this volume, to speak of the  departed; for the misgovernment of the Royal Society has not been  wholly the result of even the present race. It is said, and I think with  justice, in the life of Young, inserted amongst Dr. Johnson's, that the  famous maxim, \"DE MORTUIS NIL NISI BONUM,\" \"appears to savour more of  female weakness than of manly reason.\" The foibles and the follies of  those who are gone, may, without injury to society, repose in oblivion.  But, whoever would claim the admiration of mankind for their good  actions, must prove his impartiality by fearlessly condemning their evil  deeds. Adopt the maxim, and praise to the dead becomes worthless, from  its universality; and history, a greater fable than it has been hitherto  deemed.    Perhaps I ought to apologize for the large space I have devoted to the  Royal Society. Certainly its present state gives it no claim to that  attention; and I do it partly from respect for its former services,  and partly from the hope that, if such an Institution can be of use to  science in the present day, the attention of its members may be excited  to take steps for its restoration. Perhaps I may be blamed for having  published extracts from the minutes of its proceedings without the  permission of its Council. To have asked permission of the present  Council would have been useless. I might, however, have given the  substance of what I have extracted without the words, and no one could  then have reproached me with any infringement of our rules: but  there were two objections to that course. In the first place, it is  impossible, even for the most candid, in all cases, to convey precisely  the same sentiment in different language; and I thought it therefore  more fair towards those from whom I differed, as well as to the public,  to give the precise words. Again: had it been possible to make so  accurate a paraphrase, I should yet have preferred the risk of incurring  the reproach of the Royal Society for the offence, to escaping their  censure by an evasion. What I have done rests on my own head; and I  shrink not from the responsibility attaching to it.    If those, whose mismanagement of that Society I condemn, should accuse  me of hostility to the Royal Society; my answer is, that the party which  governs it is not the Royal Society; and that I will only admit the  justice of the accusation, when the whole body, becoming acquainted  with the system I have exposed, shall, by ratifying it with their  approbation, appropriate it to themselves: an event of which I need  scarcely add I have not the slightest anticipation.

REFLECTIONS ON THE DECLINE OF SCIENCE IN ENGLAND, AND ON SOME OF ITS  CAUSES.          INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.    It cannot have escaped the attention of those, whose acquirements enable  them to judge, and who have had opportunities of examining the state of  science in other countries, that in England, particularly with respect  to the more difficult and abstract sciences, we are much below other  nations, not merely of equal rank, but below several even of inferior  power. That a country, eminently distinguished for its mechanical  and manufacturing ingenuity, should be indifferent to the progress of  inquiries which form the highest departments of that knowledge on whose  more elementary truths its wealth and rank depend, is a fact which is  well deserving the attention of those who shall inquire into the causes  that influence the progress of nations.    To trace the gradual decline of mathematical, and with it of the highest  departments of physical science, from the days of Newton to the"]]]
