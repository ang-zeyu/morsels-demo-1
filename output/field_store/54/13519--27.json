The wing passage, which has a maximum diameter  of 3 ft. diminishing to a point, was left empty, although at the former  experiments the lower portions were filled with coal. But behind this,  and at a distance of 8 ft. from the bulkhead, a longitudinal or fore and  aft steel bulkhead 3/8 in. thick had been worked to a length of 61 ft.,  and, with the coal with which the intervening compartment was packed,  formed (as in recent armorclads) a solid rampart, 20 ft. high, for the  defense of the engine room.    The height of the double bottom between the outer and inner skin plating  is 21/2 ft. The watertight compartments were divided into stations by  means of vertical lightening plates pierced by three holes, and in order  to make them, as far as was practicable, resemble the bracket frames of  a modern armorclad, the center of the plates was cut away so as to leave  a single oval hole instead of the three circular holes. In view of the  differences of opinion which exist on the part of experts on the subject  of under water protection, the officers of the Vernon had determined to  submit the problem to the test of experiment. For this purpose steel  armor 11/2 in. thick had been worked along the outside of the upper skin  of the double bottom throughout one of the compartments, in addition to  the other protection mentioned. The Resistance had been brought down by  iron ballast to a trim of 25 feet 9 in. aft and 19 ft. 7 in. forward,  giving a mean draught of 22 feet 8 inches. She was consequently rather  further down by the stern than before, but was in other respects the  same.    When in commission, the Resistance had a mean draught of 26 feet 10  inches. The present series of experiments was of even greater importance  than the first series. The attack was gradually developed by means of  fixed and outrigger charges of increasing power, and the _coup de grace_  was not given by means of a service Whitehead in actual contact until  various lessons had been derived.    The opening experiment on June 9 consisted of an attack directed against  a new system of torpedo defenses which are to be carried by ships in  action, or when in expectation of an attack, rather than an assault upon  the ship herself. The previous experiments had clearly demonstrated that  a Whitehead, when projected against a vessel at close range, and  consequently with a maximum of motive force, could not get through the  ordinary wire netting before expending its explosive energy in the air,  and that the spars by which the nets are boomed out from the ship's side  could be reduced to 25 ft. in length without danger to the hull. The  ordinary wooden booms employed on board ship, however, are heavy and  unwieldy, weighing, as they do, more than half a ton each. In ordinary  circumstances, the spars cannot be lowered into place and the nets made  taut in less than a couple of hours, and the work of stowing them is  equally slow and laborious.    Mr. Bullivant, who manufactures the torpedo netting and hawsers for the  navy, has devised a method of getting rid of the difficulties complained  of by substituting steel booms for the wooden booms and an arrangement  of pulleys and runners, whereby the protection can be run out and in,  topped and brailed up out of the way, with great facility. The system  was tried at Portsmouth last year with considerable success upon the  Dido, but as it was thought that some of the fittings were somewhat  frail and might collapse beneath the shock of a live torpedo, it was  resolved to submit them to a practical test under service conditions  upon the Resistance. The ship was consequently fitted with three of the  steel booms on the port side. They were 32 ft. long and spaced 45 ft.  apart, and connected by a jackstay to which the nets were attached. Each  steel boom weighed 5 cwt., or less than half the weight of the ordinary  boom, and whereas the latter is fixed to the ship's side by a hook which  is liable to be disconnected or broken by the jerk of an exploding  torpedo, Mr. Bullivant's boom works in a universal or socket joint,  which cannot get out of gear except by fracture, and which permits the  boom to be moved in any direction, whether vertically or fore and aft,  close in against the sides. Below each boom is a flange, which serves as  a line along which a traveler moves, the latter being actuated by means  of a topping line running over a pulley at the head and another near the  heel.    Upon the booms being topped to a perpendicular position, the nets are  attached to the runners at the bottom of the booms close inboard  (instead of, under the existing system, to the tops of the booms from  boats alongside or otherwise), and when this is done, the mere  depression of the booms into position will cause the nets to run out of  their own accord. In like manner, when the occasion for their use has  passed, the raising of the boom will cause the nets to come alongside,  when they can either be brailed up through the grummets or disconnected  for future use.    The action of the gear is so simple and rapid that the torpedo  protection can be always ready without arresting the way of the ship. As  a length of net 30 ft. by 20 ft. deep weighs about 3 cwt., it will also  be seen that the reduction of strains by working the crinolines from the  heel instead of the head of the booms is considerable. The attack by the  Whitehead upon the booms and nettings was made shortly before 2 p.m., at  the time of high tide.    The whole affair occupied a very few minutes. As soon as the red pennant  was struck on board to show that Mr. Bullivant was satisfied with the  arrangements, and that the target was ready, the torpedo vessel Vesuvius  got under way, and after circling round the doomed hulk discharged a  Whitehead against the netting from her under-water bow torpedo tube at  an approximate range of 50 yards. As on former occasions, the missile  was one of the old 16 inch pattern, but it was understood that the  charge of gun cotton had been reduced to 87 lb., so that the net  protection should not bear a greater strain than would be the case in  actual hostilities. The torpedo, which was set to a depth of about 10  feet, struck the net in the middle and threw up an immense spout of  water, but without getting to the ship, which was apparently uninjured.  Although it hit the net immediately below the center boom, no fracture  occurred, and the points remained intact. Although at the short range  the torpedo would spin through the water at from 30 to 40 horse power,  and would deliver a formidable blow upon the net, the thrust was  effectually resisted, though as a matter of course the net was much torn  by the explosion of the baffled projectile.    Although at the second torpedo attack made on the Resistance, the  following day, the offensive power that was brought to bear was quite  exceptional, the victory remained with the ship. The charge exploded was  an exceptionally heavy one. It consisted of 220 lb. of gun cotton. It  was consequently more destructive than any which is ever likely to be  launched against an armorclad much better prepared to resist it than the  obsolete and time-worn Resistance. An idea, however, had got abroad that  the Russians either have or intend to have a locomotive torpedo capable  of carrying the same weight of explosive in its head, and the object of  the experiment was to ascertain what would be the effect of the  detonation of such an enormous charge upon the submerged portions of a  ship of war.    But, while this was no doubt the primary purpose in view, the experiment  also served the secondary purpose of determining the result of the  explosion upon the net defenses of a ship. Mr. Bullivant's booms and  runners, which were found to be scarcely anything the worse from the  ordeal of the previous day, were again used. The damaged net was taken  away and one of the old service grummet nets slung in its place, the  cylinders containing the gun cotton being attached to the jackstay  immediately in front of the battered sides, and 30 feet from the hulk,  and sunk to a distance of 20 feet below the water line, which would  bring it about opposite the bend of the bilge. By 3 p.m. everything was  ready for the explosion of the charge--everybody had cleared out of the  ship while the surrounding small craft drew off to a distance of 300  feet. The charge was electrically fired from a pinnace. The burst was  terrific and the reverberation was heard and the shock distinctly felt  in the dockyard. But the remarkable thing was that the hulk did not  appear to jump in the least, though there was not more than six feet of  water under her keel. That she would not be seriously crippled by the  discharge seems to have been accepted as a foregone conclusion by  Captain Long and the other torpedoists, as the day for the third  experiment had been fixed in advance; but that the steel booms with  their double flange running ways, stays, travelers, and hinges should  have resisted the tremendous jar and upheaval was a genuine surprise for  all concerned, and goes far to prove that except a vessel be taken  unawares, it will be impossible for a torpedo to come into actual  contact with it. At the experiments last year the wooden booms were  unhinged and splintered under a much less violent shock. But the steel  booms employed, though somewhat bent, remained unbroken and in position,  and the joints were quite uninjured. All that is necessary for perfect  defense is that the booms should be made a little heavier.    The torpedo experiments against the Resistance were resumed on June 13,  when the old ironclad suffered some rough treatment. As the experiment  was understood to be the last of the second series, and was fully  expected to have a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#2)"],[1,"this  while, of bearing her along with them against her will, so they made  ready to fare back again. When they were ready and the folk followed  them out, Gyda said to the messengers--'Now tell to King Harold these my  words:--I will only agree to be his lawful wife upon the condition that  he shall first, for sake of me, put under him the whole of Norway, so  that he may bear sway over that kingdom as freely and fully as King  Eric over the realm of Sweden, or King Gorm over Denmark; for only then,  methinks, can he be called king of a people.' Now his men came back to  King Harold, bringing him the words of the girl, and saying she was so  bold and heedless that she well deserved the king should send a greater  troop of people for her, and put her to some disgrace. Then answered the  king. 'This maid has not spoken or done so much amiss that she should  be punished, but the rather should she be thanked for her words. She has  reminded me,' said he, 'of somewhat that it seems wonderful I did not  think of before. And now,' added he, 'I make the solemn vow, and take  who made me and rules over all things, to witness that never shall I  clip or comb my hair until I have subdued all Norway with scatt, and  duties, and lordships; or, if not, have died in the seeking.' Guttorm  gave great thanks to the king for his oath, saying it was \"royal work  fulfilling royal rede.\" The new and strange government that Harold tried  to enforce--nothing less than the feudal system in a rough guise --which  made those who had hitherto been their own men save at special times,  the king's men at all times, and laid freemen under tax, was withstood  as long as might be by the sturdy Norsemen. It was only by dint of hard  fighting that he slowly won his way, until at Hafrsfirth he finally  crushed all effective opposition. But the discontented, \"and they were a  great multitude,\" fled oversea to the outlands, Iceland, the Faroes, the  Orkneys, and Ireland. The whole coast of Europe, even to Greece and the  shores of the Black Sea, the northern shores of Africa, and the western  part of Asia, felt the effects also. Rolf Pad-th'-hoof, son of Harold's  dear friend Rognvald, made an outlaw for a cattle-raid within the bounds  of the kingdom, betook himself to France, and, with his men, founded a  new people and a dynasty.    Iceland had been known for a good many years, but its only dwellers had  been Irish Culdees, who sought that lonely land to pray in peace. Now,  however, both from Norway and the Western Isles settlers began to come  in. Aud, widow of Olaf the White, King of Dublin, came, bringing with  her many of mixed blood, for the Gaedhil (pronounced \"Gael\", Irish) and  the Gaill (pronounced \"Gaul\", strangers) not only fought furiously, but  made friends firmly, and often intermarried. Indeed, the Westmen were  among the first arrivals, and took the best parts of the island--on its  western shore, appropriately enough. After a time the Vikings who had  settled in the Isles so worried Harold and his kingdom, upon which they  swooped every other while, that he drew together a mighty force, and  fell upon them wheresoever he could find them, and followed them up with  fire and sword; and this he did twice, so that in those lands none could  abide but folk who were content to be his men, however lightly they  might hold their allegiance. Hence it was to Iceland that all turned  who held to the old ways, and for over sixty years from the first comer  there was a stream of hardy men pouring in, with their families and  their belongings, simple yeomen, great and warwise chieftains, rich  landowners, who had left their land \"for the overbearing of King  Harold,\" as the \"Landnamabok\" (7) has it. \"There also we shall escape  the troubling of kings and scoundrels\", says the \"Vatsdaelasaga\". So  much of the best blood left Norway that the king tried to stay the leak  by fines and punishments, but in vain.    As his ship neared the shore, the new-coming chief would leave it to  the gods as to where he settled. The hallowed pillars of the high seat,  which were carried away from his old abode, were thrown overboard, with  certain rites, and were let drive with wind and wave until they came  ashore. The piece of land which lay next the beach they were flung upon  was then viewed from the nearest hill-summit, and place of the homestead  picked out. Then the land was hallowed by being encircled with fire,  parcelled among the band, and marked out with boundary-signs; the houses  were built, the \"town\" or home-field walled in, a temple put up, and the  settlement soon assumed shape. In 1100 there were 4500 franklins, making  a population of about 50,000, fully three-fourths of whom had a strong  infusion of Celtic blood in them. The mode of life was, and is, rather  pastoral than aught else. In the 39,200 square miles of the island's  area there are now about 250 acres of cultivated land, and although  there has been much more in times past, the Icelanders have always been  forced to reckon upon flocks and herds as their chief resources, grain  of all kinds, even rye, only growing in a few favoured places, and very  rarely there; the hay, self-sown, being the only certain harvest. On  the coast fishing and fowling were of help, but nine-tenths of the folk  lived by their sheep and cattle. Potatoes, carrots, turnips, and several  kinds of cabbage have, however, been lately grown with success. They  produced their own food and clothing, and could export enough wool,  cloth, horn, dried fish, etc., as enabled them to obtain wood for  building, iron for tools, honey, wine, grain, etc, to the extent of  their simple needs. Life and work was lotted by the seasons and  their changes; outdoor work--fishing, herding, hay-making, and  fuel-getting--filling the long days of summer, while the long, dark  winter was used in weaving and a hundred indoor crafts. The climate is  not so bad as might be expected, seeing that the island touches the  polar circle, the mean temperature at Reykjavik being 39 degrees.    The religion which the settlers took with them into Iceland--the  ethnic religion of the Norsefolk, which fought its last great fight at  Sticklestead, where Olaf Haraldsson lost his life and won the name of  Saint--was, like all religions, a compound of myths, those which had  survived from savage days, and those which expressed the various degrees  of a growing knowledge of life and better understanding of nature. Some  historians and commentators are still fond of the unscientific method of  taking a later religion, in this case christianity, and writing down all  apparently coincident parts of belief, as having been borrowed from the  christian teachings by the Norsefolk, while all that remain they lump  under some slighting head. Every folk has from the beginning of time  sought to explain the wonders of nature, and has, after its own fashion,  set forth the mysteries of life. The lowest savage, no less than his  more advanced brother, has a philosophy of the universe by which he  solves the world-problem to his own satisfaction, and seeks to reconcile  his conduct with his conception of the nature of things. Now, it is not  to be thought, save by \"a priori\" reasoners, that such a folk as the  Northmen--a mighty folk, far advanced in the arts of life, imaginative,  literary--should have had no further creed than the totemistic myths  of their primitive state; a state they have wholly left ere they enter  history. Judging from universal analogy, the religion of which record  remains to us was just what might be looked for at the particular stage  of advancement the Northmen had reached. Of course something may have  been gained from contact with other peoples--from the Greeks during the  long years in which the northern races pressed upon their frontier; from  the Irish during the existence of the western viking-kingdoms; but what  I particularly warn young students against is the constant effort of  a certain order of minds to wrest facts into agreement with their pet  theories of religion or what not. The whole tendency of the more modern  investigation shows that the period of myth-transmission is long over  ere history begins. The same confusion of different stages of  myth-making is to be found in the Greek religion, and indeed in those of  all peoples; similar conditions of mind produce similar practices, apart  from all borrowing of ideas and manners; in Greece we find snake-dances,  bear-dances, swimming with sacred pigs, leaping about in imitation of  wolves, dog-feasts, and offering of dogs' flesh to the gods--all of them  practices dating from crude savagery, mingled with ideas of exalted and  noble beauty, but none now, save a bigot, would think of accusing the  Greeks of having stolen all their higher beliefs. Even were some part of  the matter of their myths taken from others, yet the Norsemen have given  their gods a noble, upright, great spirit, and placed them upon a high  level that is all their own. (8) From the prose Edda the following  all too brief statement of the salient points of Norse belief is made  up:--\"The first and eldest of gods is hight Allfather; he lives from  all ages, and rules over all his realm, and sways all things great and  small; he smithied heaven and earth, and the lift, and all that belongs  to them; what is most, he made man, and gave him a soul that shall live  and never perish; and all men that are right-minded shall live and be  with himself in Vingolf; but wicked men fare to Hell, and thence into  Niithell, that is beneath in the ninth world. Before the earth ''twas  the morning of time, when yet naught was, nor sand nor sea was  there, nor cooling streams. Earth was not found, nor Heaven above; a  Yawning-gap there was, but grass nowhere.'
