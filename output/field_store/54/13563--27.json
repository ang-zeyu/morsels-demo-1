Then, too, no one has ever exhausted the limitless resources of a  farmer's wagon-shed. In it you find the accumulations of  generations, bits of every conceivable thing,--all rusty, of  course, and seemingly worthless, but sure to serve your purpose on  a pinch, and so accessible, never locked; just go in and help  yourself. Nowadays farmers use and abuse so much complicated  machinery, that it is more than likely one could construct entire  an automobile from the odds and ends of a half-dozen farm-yards.    All boys and most girls--under twelve--say, \"Gimme a ride;\" some  boys and a few girls--over twelve--say, \"You look lonesome,  mister.\" What the hoodlums of the cities say will hardly bear  repetition. In spite of its swiftness the automobile offers  opportunities for studying human nature appreciated only by the  driver.    The city hoodlum is a most aggressive individual; he is not  invariably in tattered clothes, and is by no means confined to the  alleys and side streets. The hoodlum element is a constituent part  of human nature, present in every one; the classification of the  individual depending simply upon the depth at which the turbulent  element is buried, upon the number and thickness of the overlying  strata of civilization and refinement. In the recognized hoodlum  the obnoxious element is quite at the surface; in the best of us  it is only too apt to break forth,--no man can be considered an  absolutely extinct volcano.    One can readily understand why owners and drivers of horses should  feel and even exhibit a marked aversion towards the automobile,  since, from their stand-point, it is an unmitigated nuisance; but  why the hoodlums who stand about the street corners should be  animated by a seemingly irresistible desire to hurl stones and  brickbats--as well as epithets--at passing automobiles is a  mystery worth solving; it presents an interesting problem in  psychology. What is the mental process occasioned by the sudden  appearance of an automobile, and which results in the hurling of  the first missile which comes to hand? It must be a reversion to  savage instincts, the instinct of the chase; something strange  comes quickly into view; it makes a strange noise, emits, perhaps,  a strange odor, is passing quickly and about to escape; it must be  killed, hence the brickbat. Uncontrollable impulse! poor hoodlum,  he cannot help it; if he could restrain the hand and stay the  brickbat he would not be a hoodlum, but a man. Time and custom  have tamed him so that he lets horses, bicycles, and carriages  pass; he can't quite help slinging a stone at an advertising van  or any strange vehicle, while the automobile is altogether too  much.    That it is the machine which rouses his savage instincts is clear  from the fact that rarely is anything thrown at the occupants.  Complete satisfaction is found in hitting the thing itself; no  doubt regret would be felt if any one were injured, but if the  stone resounds upon the iron frame of the moving devil, the  satisfaction is felt that the best of us might experience from  hitting the scaly sides of a slumbering sea-monster, for hit him  we would, though at immediate risk of perdition.    The American hoodlum has, withal, his good points. If you are not  in trouble, he will revile and stone you; if in trouble, he will  commiserate and assist. He is quick to put his shoulder to the  wheel and push, pull or lift; often with mechanical insight  superior to the unfortunate driver he will discern the difficulty  and suggest the remedy; dirt has no terrors for him, oil is his  delight, grease the goal of his desires; mind you, all this  concerns the American hoodlum or the hoodlum of indefinite or of  Irish extraction; it applies not to the Teutonic or other hoodlum.  He will pass you by with phlegmatic indifference, he will not  throw things at you, neither will he help you unless strongly  appealed to, and then not over-zealously or over-intelligently;  his application is short-lived and he hurries on; but the other  hoodlum will stay with you all night if necessary, finding, no  doubt, the automobile a pleasant diversion from a bed on the  grass.    But the dissension a quarter will cause! A battle royal was once  produced by a dollar. They had all assisted, but, like the workers  in the vineyard, some had come early and some late. The  automobile, in trying to turn on a narrow road, had dropped off  the side into low wet ground; the early comers could not quite get  it back, but with the aid of the later it was done; the division  of a dollar left behind raised the old, old problem. Unhappily, it  fell into the hands of a late comer for distribution, and it was  his contention that the final lift did the work, that all previous  effort was so much wasted energy; the early comers contended that  the reward should be in proportion to expenditure of time and  muscle and not measured by actual achievement,--a discussion not  without force on both sides, but cut short by a scrimmage  involving far more force than the discussion. All of which goes to  show the disturbing influence of money, for in all truth those who  had assisted did not expect any reward; they first laughed to see  the machine in the ditch, and then turned to like tigers to get it  out.    This whole question of paying for services in connection with  automobiling is as interesting as it is new. The people are not  adjusted to the strange vehicle. A man with a white elephant could  probably travel from New York to San Francisco without disbursing  a penny for the keeping of his animal. Farmers and even liverymen  would keep and feed it on the way without charge. It is a good  deal so with an automobile; it is still sufficiently a curiosity  to command respect and attention. The farmer is glad to have it  stop in front of his door or put up in his shed; he will supply it  with oil and water. The blacksmith would rather have it stop at  his shop for repair than at his rival's,--it gives him a little  notoriety, something to talk about. So it is with the liveryman at  night; he is, as a rule, only too glad to have the novelty under  his roof, and takes pride in showing it to the visiting townsfolk.  They do not know what to charge, and therefore charge nothing. It  is often with difficulty anything can be forced upon them; they  are quite averse to accepting gratuities; meanwhile, the farmer,  whose horse and cart have taken up far less room and caused far  less trouble, pays the fixed charge.    These conditions prevail only in localities where automobiles are  seen infrequently. Along the highways where they travel frequently  all is quite changed; many a stable will not house them at any  price, and those that will, charge goodly sums for the service.    It is one thing to own an automobile, another thing to operate it.  It is one thing to sit imposingly at the steering-wheel until  something goes wrong, and quite another thing to repair and go on.    There are chauffeurs and chauffeurs,--the latter wear the  paraphernalia and are photographed, while the former are working  under the machines. You can tell the difference by the goggles.  The sham chauffeur sits in front and turns the wheel, the real  sits behind and takes things as they come; the former wears the  goggles, the latter finds sufficient protection in the smut on the  end of his nose.    There is every excuse for relying helplessly on an expert mechanic  if you have no mechanical ingenuity, or are averse to getting  dirty and grimy; but that is not automobiling; it is being run  about in a huge perambulator.    The real chauffeur knows every moment by the sound and \"feel\" of  his machine exactly what it is doing, the amount of gasoline it is  taking, whether the lubrication is perfect, the character and heat  of the spark, the condition of almost every screw, nut, and bolt,  and he runs his machine accordingly; at the first indication of  anything wrong he stops and takes the stitch in time that saves  ninety and nine later. The sham chauffeur sits at the wheel, and  in the security of ignorance runs gayly along until his machine is  a wreck; he may have hours, days, or even weeks of blind  enjoyment, but the end is inevitable, and the repairs costly; then  he blames every one but himself,--blames the maker for not making  a machine that may be operated by inexperience forever, blames the  men in his stable for what reason he knows not, blames the roads,  the country, everything and everybody--but himself.    It is amusing to hear the sham chauffeur talk. When things go  well, he does it; when they go wrong, it is the fault of some one  else; if he makes a successful run, the mechanic with him is a  nonentity; if he breaks down, the mechanic is his only resource.  It is more interesting to hear the mechanic--the real chauffeur  --talk when he is flat on his back making good the mistakes of his  master, but his conversation could not be printed _verbatim et  literatim_,--it is explosive and without a muffler.    The man who cannot run his machine a thousand miles without expert  assistance should make no pretense to being a chauffeur, for he is  not one. The chauffeur may use mechanics whenever he can find  them; but if he can't find them, he gets along just as well; and  when he does use them it is not for information and advice, but to  do just the things he wants done and no more. The skilled  enthusiast would not think of letting even an expert from the  factory do anything to his machine, unless he stood over him and  watched every movement; as soon would a lover of horses permit his  hostlers to dope his favorite mount.

Texans and Indians trim for a charge:      \"Stand ready, men!  Let them come close, right up, and then      After the lead, the iron;  Fire, and charge back!\" So strength returned to Lyon.    The Iowa men who held the van,      Half drilled, were new  To battle: \"Some one lead us, then we'll do\"      Said Corporal Tryon:  \"Men! _I_ will lead,\" and a light glared in Lyon.    On they came: they yelped, and fired;      His spirit sped;  We leveled right in, and the half-breeds fled,      Nor stayed the iron,  Nor captured the crimson corse of Lyon.    This seer foresaw his soldier-doom,      Yet willed the fight.  He never turned; his only flight      Was up to Zion,  Where prophets now and armies greet brave Lyon.        Ball's Bluff.  A Reverie.  (October, 1861.)      One noonday, at my window in the town,    I saw a sight--saddest that eyes can see--    Young soldiers marching lustily        Unto the wars,  With fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry;      While all the porches, walks, and doors  Were rich with ladies cheering royally.    They moved like Juny morning on the wave,    Their hearts were fresh as clover in its prime    (It was the breezy summer time),        Life throbbed so strong,  How should they dream that Death in a rosy clime      Would come to thin their shining throng?  Youth feels immortal, like the gods sublime.    Weeks passed; and at my window, leaving bed,    By night I mused, of easeful sleep bereft,    On those brave boys (Ah War! thy theft);        Some marching feet  Found pause at last by cliffs Potomac cleft;      Wakeful I mused, while in the street  Far footfalls died away till none were left.        Dupont's Round Fight.  (November, 1861.)      In time and measure perfect moves    All Art whose aim is sure;  Evolving ryhme and stars divine    Have rules, and they endure.    Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right,    And, warring so, prevailed,  In geometric beauty curved,    And in an orbit sailed.    The rebel at Port Royal felt    The Unity overawe,  And rued the spell. A type was here,    And victory of Law.        The Stone Fleet.[2]  An Old Sailor's Lament.  (December, 1861.)      I have a feeling for those ships,    Each worn and ancient one,  With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam;    Ay, it was unkindly done.        But so they serve the Obsolete--        Even so, Stone Fleet!    You'll say I'm doting; do but think    I scudded round the Horn in one--  The Tenedos, a glorious    Good old craft as ever run--        Sunk (how all unmeet!)        With the Old Stone Fleet.    An India ship of fame was she,    Spices and shawls and fans she bore;  A whaler when her wrinkles came--    Turned off! till, spent and poor,        Her bones were sold (escheat)!        Ah! Stone Fleet.    Four were erst patrician keels    (Names attest what families be),  The Kensington, and Richmond too,    Leonidas, and Lee:        But now they have their seat        With the Old Stone Fleet.    To scuttle them--a pirate deed--    Sack them, and dismast;  They sunk so slow, they died so hard,    But gurgling dropped at last.        Their ghosts in gales repeat        _Woe's us, Stone Fleet!_    And all for naught. The waters pass--    Currents will have their way;  Nature is nobody's ally; 'tis well;    The harbor is bettered--will stay.        A failure, and complete,        Was your Old Stone Fleet.        Donelson.  (February, 1862.)      The bitter cup    Of that hard countermand  Which gave the Envoys up,  Still was wormwood in the mouth,    And clouds involved the land,  When, pelted by sleet in the icy street,    About the bulletin-board a band  Of eager, anxious people met,  And every wakeful heart was set  On latest news from West or South.  \"No seeing here,\" cries one--\"don't crowd--\"  \"You tall man, pray you, read aloud.\"    IMPORTANT.      _We learn that General Grant,    Marching from Henry overland,  And joined by a force up the Cumberland sent    (Some thirty thousand the command),  On Wednesday a good position won--  Began the siege of Donelson.    The stronghold crowns a river-bluff,    A good broad mile of leveled top;  Inland the ground rolls off    Deep-gorged, and rocky, and broken up--  A wilderness of trees and brush.    The spaded summit shows the roods  Of fixed intrenchments in their hush;    Breast-works and rifle-pits in woods  Perplex the base.--                     The welcome weather    Is clear and mild; 'tis much like May.  The ancient boughs that lace together  Along the stream, and hang far forth,    Strange with green mistletoe, betray  A dreamy contrast to the North.    Our troops are full of spirits--say    The siege won't prove a creeping one.  They purpose not the lingering stay  Of old beleaguerers; not that way;    But, full of _vim_ from Western prairies won,    They'll make, ere long, a dash at Donelson._    Washed by the storm till the paper grew  Every shade of a streaky blue,  That bulletin stood. The next day brought  A second.      LATER FROM THE FORT.  _Grant's investment is complete--      A semicircular one.  Both wings the Cumberland's margin meet,  Then, backwkard curving, clasp the rebel seat.    On Wednesday this good work was done;    But of the doers some lie prone.  Each wood, each hill, each glen was fought for;  The bold inclosing line we wrought for  Flamed with sharpshooters. Each cliff cost  A limb or life. But back we forced  Reserves and all; made good our hold;  And so we rest.                   Events unfold.  On Thursday added ground was won,    A long bold steep: we near the Den.  Later the foe came shouting down    In sortie, which was quelled; and then  We stormed them on their left.  A chilly change in the afternoon;  The sky, late clear, is now bereft  Of sun. Last night the ground froze hard--  Rings to the enemy as they run  Within their works. A ramrod bites  The lip it meets. The cold incites  To swinging of arms with brisk rebound.  Smart blows 'gainst lusty chests resound.    Along the outer line we ward    A crackle of skirmishing goes on.  Our lads creep round on hand and knee,    They fight from behind each trunk and stone;    And sometimes, flying for refuge, one  Finds 'tis an enemy shares the tree.  Some scores are maimed by boughs shot off    In the glades by the Fort's big gun.    We mourn the loss of colonel Morrison,    Killed while cheering his regiment on.  Their far sharpshooters try our stuff;  And ours return them puff for puff:  'Tis diamond-cutting-diamond work.    Woe on the rebel cannoneer  Who shows his head. Our fellows lurk    Like Indians that waylay the deer  By the wild salt-spring.--The sky is dun,  Fordooming the fall of Donelson.    Stern weather is all unwonted here.    The people of the country own  We brought it. Yea, the earnest North  Has elementally issued forth    To storm this Donelson._    FURTHER.           A yelling rout  Of ragamuffins broke profuse    To-day from out the Fort.    Sole uniform they wore, a sort  Of patch, or white badge (as you choose)    Upon the arm. But leading these,  Or mingling, were men of face  And bearing of patrician race,  Splendid in courage and gold lace--    The officers. Before the breeze  Made by their charge, down went our line;  But, rallying, charged back in force,  And broke the sally; yet with loss.  This on the left; upon the right  Meanwhile there was an answering fight;    Assailants and assailed reversed.  The charge too upward, and not down--  Up a steep ridge-side, toward its crown,    A strong redoubt. But they who first  Gained the fort's base, and marked the trees  Felled, heaped in horned perplexities,    And shagged with brush; and swarming there  Fierce wasps whose sting was present death--  They faltered, drawing bated breath,    And felt it was in vain to dare;  Yet still, perforce, returned the ball,  Firing into the tangled wall  Till ordered to come down. They came;  But left some comrades in their fame,  Red on the ridge in icy wreath  And hanging gardens of cold Death.    But not quite unavenged these fell;  Our ranks once out of range, a blast    Of shrapnel and quick shell  Burst on the rebel horde, still massed,    Scattering them pell-mell.      (This fighting--judging what we read--      Both charge and countercharge,      Would seem but Thursday's told at large,      Before in brief reported.--Ed.)  Night closed in about the Den    Murky and lowering. Ere long, chill rains.  A night not soon to be forgot,    Reviving old rheumatic pains  And longings for a cot.      No blankets, overcoats, or tents.  Coats thrown aside on the warm march here--  We looked not then for changeful cheer;  Tents, coats, and blankets too much care.    No fires; a fire a mark presents;    Near by, the trees show bullet-dents.  Rations were eaten cold and raw.    The men well soaked, come snow; and more--  A midnight sally. Small sleeping done--      But such is war;  No matter, we'll have Fort Donelson._              \"Ugh! ugh!  'Twill drag along--drag along\"  Growled a cross patriot in the throng,  His battered umbrella like an ambulance-cover  Riddled with bullet-holes, spattered all over.  \"Hurrah for Grant!\" cried a stripling shrill;  Three urchins joined him with a will,  And some of taller stature cheered.  Meantime a Copperhead passed; he sneered.    \"Win or lose,\" he pausing said,  \"Caps fly the same; all boys, mere boys;  Any thing to make a noise.    Like to see the list of the dead;  These '_craven Southerners_' hold out;  Ay, ay, they'll give you many a bout\"    \"We'll beat in the end, sir\"  Firmly said one in staid rebuke,  A solid merchant, square and stout.    \"And do you think it? that way tend, sir\"  Asked the lean Cooperhead, with a look  Of splenetic pity. \"Yes, I do\"  His yellow death's head the croaker shook:  \"The country's ruined, that I know\"  A shower of broken ice and snow,    In lieu of words, confuted him;  They saw him hustled round the corner go,    And each"]]]
