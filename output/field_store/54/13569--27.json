The great difference between the more or less unorganized hand  labour and the essential organization of modern mills and factories  soon became apparent, for in the first place it was difficult to  induce the natives to remain inside the works during the period of  training, and equally difficult to keep the trained operatives  constantly employed. Monetary affairs induced them to leave the  mills and factories for their more usual mode of living in the  country.    In the face of these difficulties, however, the industry grew in  India as well as in Dundee. For several years before the war, the  quantity of raw jute fibre brought to Dundee and other British ports  amounted to 200,000 tons. During the same period preceding the war,  nearly 1,000,000 tons were exported to various countries, while the  Indian annual consumption--due jointly to the home industry and the  mills in the vicinity of Calcutta--reached the same huge total of  one million tons.    The growth of the jute industry in several parts of the world, and  consequently its gradually increasing importance in regard to the  production of yarns and cloth for various purposes, enables it to be  ranked as one of the important industries in the textile group, and  one which may perhaps attain a much more important position in the  near future amongst our national manufacturing processes. As a  matter of fact, at the present time, huge extensions are  contemplated and actually taking place in India.          CHAPTER II.  CULTIVATION    _Botanical and Physical Features of the Plant_. Jute fibre is  obtained from two varieties of plants which appear to differ only in  the shape of the fruit or seed vessel. Thus, the fruit of the  variety _Corchorus Capsularis_ is enclosed in a capsule of  approximately circular section, whereas the fruit of the variety  _Corchorus Olitorius_ is contained in a pod. Both belong to the  order _Tiliacea_, and are annuals cultivated mostly in Bengal and  Assam.    Other varieties are recorded, e.g. the _Corchorus Japonicus_ of Japan,  and the _Corchorus Mompoxensis_ used in Panama for making a kind of  tea, while one variety of jute plant is referred to in the book of  job as the Jew's Mallow; this variety _C. Olitorius_, has been used  in the East from time immemorial as a pot herb.    The two main varieties _C. Capsularis_ and _C. Olilorius_ are  cultivated in Bengal for the production of fibre, while for seed  purposes, large tracts of land are cultivated in Assam, and the  seeds exported for use principally in Mymensingh and Dacca.    The above two varieties of the jute plant vary in height from 5 to  15 feet, and, in a normal season, reach maturity in about four  months from the time of sowing. In some districts the stems of jute  plants are sometimes rather dark in colour, but, in general, they are  green or pink, and straight with a tendency to branch. The leaves  are alternate on the stems, 4 to 5 inches in length, and about 1-1/2  inches in breadth with serrated edges. Pale yellow flowers spring  from the axil (axilla) of the leaves, and there is an abundance of  small seeds in the fruit which, as mentioned, is characteristic of  the variety.    While many attempts have been made to cultivate jute plants in  various parts of the world, the results seem to indicate that the  necessary conditions for the successful cultivation of them are  completely fulfilled only in the Bengal area, and the geographical  position of this province is mainly responsible for these conditions.  On referring to a map of India, it will be seen that Bengal is  directly north of the bay of that name, and is bounded on the north  by the great Himalayan mountains.    During the winter period when the prevailing winds are from the north,  large areas of the mountainous regions are covered with snow, but  when the winds change and come from the south, and particularly  during the warmer weather, the moist warm air raises the general  temperature and also melts much of the snow on the mountain tracts.  The rain and melted snow swell the two great rivers on the east and  west of Bengal--the Patna and the Brahmaputra--and the tremendous  volume of water carries down decayed vegetable and animal matter  which is ultimately spread on the flat areas of Bengal as alluvial  deposits, and thus provides an ideal layer of soil for the  propagation of the jute plants.    The cultivation of land for the growing of jute plants is most  extensively conducted in the centres bordering on the courses of the  rivers, and particularly in Mymensingh, Dacca, Hooghly and Pabna,  and while 90 per cent. of the fibre is produced in Bengal, Orissa  and Bihar, there is 10 per cent. produced outside these areas.    The _Corchorus Capsularis_ variety is usually cultivated in the  higher and richer soils, while the _Corchorus Olitorius_ variety is  most suited for the lower-lying alluvial soils, and to the districts  where the rainfall is irregular; indeed, the _C. Olitorius_ may be  grown in certain other districts of India which appear quite  unsuitable for the _C. Capsularis_.    The farming operations in India are rather simple when compared with  the corresponding operations in this country; there is evidently not  the same necessity for extensive working of the Indian soil as there  is for the heavier lands; another reason for the primitive Eastern  methods may be the absence of horses.    The ploughs are made of wood and faced with iron. Bullocks, in teams  of two or more, are harnessed to the plough as shown in Fig. 1 where  a field is being ploughed as a preliminary process in jute  cultivation. The bullocks draw the plough in much the same way as  horses do in this country.    The operation of ploughing breaks up the soil, while the rough clods  may be broken by hand mallets or by the use of the \"hengha\"--a piece  of tree boll harnessed at the ends to a pair of bullocks.    The breaking up of the land prepares it for the cleaning process  which is performed by what are termed \"ladders\"; these ladders are  made of a few bamboos fixed cross-wise and provided with projecting  pins to scratch or open the soil, and to collect the roots of the  previous crop; they are the equivalent of our harrows, and may be  used repeatedly during the winter and spring seasons so that a fine  tilth may be produced.    When manure is essential, it is applied in the later ploughings, but  other large areas have artificial or chemical manures added at  similar stages in the process. Farm-yard manure is preferred, but  castor-cake and the water hyacinth--a weed--constitute good  substitutes.      After the soil has been satisfactorily prepared, the seed is sown by  hand at the period which appears most suitable for the particular  district. The usual sowing time is from February to the end of May,  and even in June in some districts where late crops can be obtained.    [Illustration: FIG. 1 NATIVES PLOUGHING THE GROUND]    There are early and late varieties of the plants, and a carefully  judged distribution of the varieties of seed over the districts for  the growing period will not only yield a succession of crops for  easy harvesting, but will also help the farmer in the selection of  seeds for other areas where atmospheric conditions differ.      It is a good practice, where possible, to sow the seed in two  directions at right angles to each other, and thus secure as uniform  a distribution as possible. The amount of seed used depends partly  upon the district, and in general from 10 lbs. to 30 lbs. per acre  are sown. The seed may cost about 8 annas or more per ser (about 2  lbs.).    [Illustration: FIG. 2 BREAKING UP THE SOIL, OR \"LADDERING\"]    Plants should be specially cultivated for the production of seed in  order to obtain the best results from these seeds for fibre plants.  Many of the ryots (farmers) use seed which has been collected from  plants grown from inferior seed, or from odd and often poor plants;  they also grow plants year after year on the same soil. The fibres  obtained, as a rule, and as a result of this method of obtaining  seeds, gradually deteriorate; much better results accrue when  succession of crops and change of seed are carefully attended to.    If the weather conditions are favourable, the seeds will germinate in  8 to 10 days, after which the plants grow rapidly. The heat and  showers of rain combined soon form a crust on the soil which should  be broken; this is done by means of another ladder provided with  long pins, and Fig. 2 illustrates the operation in process. This  second laddering process opens up the soil and allows the moisture  and heat to enter. The young plants are now thinned, and the ground  weeded periodically, until the plants reach a sufficient height or  strength to prevent the words from spreading.    The space between the growing plants will vary according to the  region; if there is a tendency to slow growth, there is an abundance  of plants; whereas, the thinning is most severe where the plants  show prospects of growing thick and tall.    In a normal season the plants will reach maturity in about 3 1/2 to  4 months from the time of sowing. Although different opinions are  held as to the best time for harvesting, that when the fruits are  setting appears to be most in favour; plants harvested at this stage  usually yield a large quantity of good fibre which can be perfectly  cleaned, and which is of good spinning quality.    The plants are cut down by hand and with home-made knives; in general,  these knives are of crude manufacture, but they appear to be quite  suitable for the purpose. A field of jute plants ready for cutting  will certainly form a delightful picture, but the prospect of the  operation of cutting indicates a formidable piece of work since it  requires about 10 to 14 tons of the green crop to produce about 10 to  15 cwt. of clean"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#2)"],[1,"superstition. Such a poem as _The Pilgrimage to Kevlaar_ would be  amazing as coming from an unbeliever, did we not see in it evidence of  the poet's capacity for perfect sympathetic adoption of the spirit of  his early environment. The same is true of many another poetic  expression of simple faith, whether in Christianity or in the  mythology of German folk-lore.    Interest in medieval Catholicism and in folk-lore is one of the most  prominent traits in the Romantic movement, which reached its  culmination during the boyhood of Heine. The history of Heine's  connection with this movement is foreshadowed by the circumstances of  his first contact with it. He tells us that the first book he ever  read was _Don Quixote_ (in the translation by Tieck). At about the  same time he read _Gulliver's Travels_, the tales of noble robbers  written by Goethe's brother-in-law, Vulpius, the wildly fantastic  stories of E.T.A. Hoffmann, Schiller's _Robbers_; but also Uhland's  ballads, and the songs collected by Arnim and Brentano in _The Boy's  Magic Horn_. That is to say: At the time when in school a critical and  skeptical mind was being developed in him by descendants of the age of  enlightenment, his private reading led him for the most part into the  region of romanticism in its most exaggerated form. At the time,  furthermore, when he took healthy romantic interest in the picturesque  Dusseldorf life, his imagination was morbidly stimulated by furtive  visits to a woman reputed to be a witch, and to her niece, the  daughter of a hangman. His earliest poems, the _Dream Pictures_,  belong in an atmosphere charged with witchery, crime, and the  irresponsibility of nightmare. This coincidence of incompatible  tendencies will later be seen to account for much of the mystery in  Heine's problematic character.    It having been decided, perhaps because the downfall of Napoleon shut  the door of all other opportunity, that Heine should embark upon a  mercantile career, he was given a brief apprenticeship, in 1815 at  Frankfurt, in the following years at Hamburg, under the immediate  patronage of his uncle Salomon who, in 1818, even established the  young poet in a dry goods business of his own. The only result of  these experiments was the demonstration of Heine's total inaptitude  for commercial pursuits. But the uncle was magnanimous and offered his  nephew the means necessary for a university course in law, with a view  to subsequent practice in Hamburg. Accordingly, after some brushing up  of Latin at home, Heine in the fall of 1819 was matriculated as a  student at the University of Bonn.    In spite of failure to accomplish his immediate purpose, Heine had not  sojourned in vain at Hamburg. He had gained the good will of an  opulent uncle whose bounty he continued almost uninterruptedly to  enjoy to the end of his days. But in a purpose that lay much nearer to  his heart he had failed lamentably; for, always sensitive to the  charms of the other sex, Heine had conceived an overpowering passion  for his cousin Amalie, the daughter of Salomon, only to meet with  scornful rebuffs at the hands of the coquettish and worldly-minded  heiress. There is no reason to suppose that Amalie ever took her  cousin's advances seriously. Her father certainly did not so take  them. On the other hand, there is equally little reason to doubt the  sincerity and depth of Heine's feelings, first of unfounded hope, then  of persistent despair that pursued him in the midst of other  occupations and even in the fleeting joys of other loves. The most  touching poems included among the _Youthful Sorrows_ of his first  volume were inspired by Amalie Heine.    At Bonn Heine was a diligent student. Though never a roysterer, he  took part in various extra-academic enterprises, was a member of the  _Burschenschaft_, that democratic-patriotic organization so gravely  suspected by the reactionary governments, and made many friends. He  duly studied history and law; he heard Ernst Moritz Arndt interpret  the _Germania_ of Tacitus; but more especially did he profit by  official and personal relations with A.W. Schlegel, who taught Heine  what he himself knew best, namely, the secret of literary form and the  art of metrical expression.    The fall of 1820 saw Heine at Goettingen, the Hanoverian university to  which, shortly before, the Americans Ticknor and Everett had repaired  and at which in that very year Bancroft had attained his degree of  doctor of philosophy. Here, however, Heine was repelled by the  aristocratic exclusiveness of the Hanoverian squires who gave the tone  to student society, as well as by the mummified dryness of the  professors. In marked contrast to the patriotic and romantic spirit of  Bonn he noted here with amazement that the distinguished Germanist  Benecke lectured on the _Nibelungenlied_ to an auditory of nine. His  own residence was destined this time to be brief; for serious quarrels  coming to the ear of the faculty, he was, on January 23, 1821,  advised to withdraw; and in April he enrolled himself as a student at  the University of Berlin.    The next three years were filled with manifold activities. As a  student Heine was deeply impressed by the absolute philosophy  expounded by Hegel; as a Jew he lent a willing hand to the endeavors  of an association recently founded for the amelioration of the social  and political condition of the Hebrews; in the drawing room of Rahel  Levin, now the wife of Varnhagen von Ense, he came in touch with  gifted men and women who were ardent admirers of Goethe, and some of  whom, a quarter of a century before, had befriended Friedrich  Schlegel; and in the subterranean restaurant of Lutter and Wegener he  joined in the revels of Hoffmann, Grabbe, and other eccentric  geniuses. Heine now began to be known as a man of letters. After  having, from 1817 on, printed occasional poems in newspapers and  magazines, he published in December, 1821 (with the date 1822), his  first volume, entitled simply _Poems_; he wrote newspaper articles on  Berlin and on Poland, which he visited in the summer of 1822; and in  the spring of 1823 he published _Tragedies together with a Lyrical  Intermezzo_--two very romantic and undramatic plays in verse,  separated in the volume by a short series of lyrical poems.    Meanwhile Amalie Heine had been married and Harry's parents had moved  to Lueneburg. Regret for the loss of Amalie soon gave way to a new  passion for a very young girl, whose identity remains uncertain, but  who was probably Amalie's little sister Therese. In any case, Heine  met the new love on the occasion of a visit to Lueneburg and Hamburg in  the spring of 1823, and was haunted by her image during the summer  spent at Cuxhaven. Here Heine first saw the sea. In less exalted moods  he dallied with fisher maidens; he did not forget Amalie; but the  youthful grace and purity of Therese dominate most of the poems of  this summer. The return from the watering place gave Heine the title  _The Return Home_ for this collection of pieces which, when published  in 1826, was dedicated to Frau Varnhagen von Ense.    Uncle Salomon, to whom the _Tragedies_ had been affectionately  inscribed, was not displeased with the growing literary reputation of  his nephew. But he saw no sense in the idea that Heine already  entertained of settling in Paris. He insisted that the young man  should complete his studies; and so, in January, 1824, Heine once more  betook himself to Goettingen, where on the twenty-first of July, 1825,  he was duly promoted _Doctor utriusque Juris_. In the summer of 1824  he made the trip through the Hartz mountains which served as the basis  of _The Journey to the Hartz_; immediately before his promotion he  submitted to baptism in the Lutheran church as Christian Johann  Heinrich Heine.    Submission is the right word for this conversion. It was an act of  expediency such as other ambitious men found unavoidable in those  days; but Heine performed it in a spirit of bitterness caused not so  much by a sense of apostasy as by contempt for the conventional  Christianity that he now embraced. There can be no sharper contrast  than that presented by such a poem as _The Pilgrimage to Kevlaar_ and  sundry satirical pieces not included in this volume.    Two vacations at Norderney, where Heine renewed and deepened  acquaintance with his beloved North Sea, not very resolute attempts to  take up the practice of law in Hamburg, a trip to London, vain hopes  of a professorship in Munich, a sojourn in Italy, vacillations between  Hamburg, Berlin, and the North Sea, complete the narrative of Heine's  movements to the end of the first period of his life. He was now Heine  the writer: poet, journalist, and novelist. _The Journey to the  Hartz_, first published in a magazine, _Der Gesellschafter_, in  January and February, 1826, was issued in May of that year by Campe in  Hamburg, as the first volume of _Pictures of Travel_, beginning with  the poems of _The Return Home_ and concluding with the first group of  hymns to the North Sea, written at Norderney in the previous year.  _Pictures of Travel II_, issued in 1827, consisted of the second cycle  of poems on the _North Sea_, an account in prose of life on the  island, entitled _Norderney, The Book Le Grand_, to which epigrams by  Immermann were appended, and extracts from _Letters from Berlin_  published in 1822. _Pictures of Travel III_ (1830) began with  experiences in Italy, but degenerated into a provoked but ruthless  attack upon Platen. _Pictures of Travel IV_ (1831) included _English  Fragments_, the record of Heine's observations in London, and _The  City of Lucca_, a supplementary chapter on Italy. In October, 1827,  Heine collected under the title _Book of Songs_ nearly all of his  poems written up to that time.    The first period in Heine's life closes with the year 1831.
