The foundations of the difficulty had been laid in the reign of King  James. That monarch, who in figure, manners, and mind was in the  strongest contrast to all the English kings who had preceded him, was  infinitely more mischievous than a more foolish monarch could have been.  Coarse in manner--a buffoon in demeanor--so weak, that in many matters  he suffered himself to be a puppet in the hands of the profligates who  surrounded him, he had yet a certain amount of cleverness, and an  obstinacy which nothing could overcome. He brought with him from  Scotland an overweening opinion of the power and dignity of his position  as a king. The words--absolute monarchy--had hitherto meant only a  monarch free from foreign interference; to James they meant a monarchy  free from interference on the part of Lords or Commons. He believed  implicitly in the divine right of kings to do just as they chose, and in  all things, secular and ecclesiastical, to impose their will upon their  subjects.    At that time, upon the Continent, the struggle of Protestantism and  Catholicism was being fought out everywhere. In France the Huguenots  were gradually losing ground, and were soon to be extirpated. In  Germany the Protestant princes had lost ground. Austria, at one time  halting between two opinions, had now espoused vehemently the side of  the pope, and save in Holland and Switzerland, Catholicism was  triumphing all along the line. While the sympathies of the people of  England were strongly in favor of their co-religionists upon the  Continent, those of James inclined toward Catholicism, and in all  matters ecclesiastical he was at variance with his subjects. What  caused, if possible, an even deeper feeling of anger than his  interference in church matters, was his claim to influence the decisions  of the law courts. The pusillanimity of the great mass of the judges  hindered them from opposing his outrageous claims, and the people saw  with indignation and amazement the royal power becoming infinitely  greater and more extended than anything to which Henry VIII. or even  Elizabeth had laid claim. The negotiations of the king for a marriage  between his son and the Infanta of Spain raised the fears of the people  to the highest point. The remembrance of the Spanish armada was still  fresh in their minds, and they looked upon an alliance with Spain as the  most unholy of contracts, and as threatening alike the religion and  liberties of Englishmen.    Thus when at King James' death King Charles ascended the throne, he  inherited a legacy of trouble. Unhappily, his disposition was even more  obstinate than that of his father. His training had been wholly bad, and  he had inherited the pernicious ideas of his father in reference to the  rights of kings. Even more unfortunately, he had inherited his father's  counselors. The Duke of Buckingham, a haughty, avaricious, and ambitious  noble, raised by King James from obscurity, urged him to follow the path  of his father, and other evil counselors were not wanting. King  Charles, indeed, had an advantage over his father, inasmuch as his  person was stately and commanding, his manner grave and dignified, and  his private life irreproachable. The conflicts which had continued  throughout the reign of his father between king and Parliament speedily  broke out afresh. The Commons refused to grant supplies, unless the king  granted rights and privileges which he deemed alike derogatory and  dangerous. The shifty foreign policy of England was continued, and soon  the breach was as wide as it had been during the previous reign.    After several Parliaments had been called and dissolved, some gaining  advantage from the necessities of the king, others meeting only to  separate after discussions which imbittered the already existing  relations, for ten years the king dispensed with a Parliament. The  murder of the Duke of Buckingham by Felton brought no alleviation to the  situation. In Ireland, Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, ruled with  tyrannical power. He was a man of clear mind and of great talent, and  his whole efforts were devoted to increasing the power of the king, and  so, as he considered, the benefit of the country. In Ireland he had a  submissive Parliament, and by the aid of this he raised moneys, and  ruled in a manner which, tyrannical as it was, was yet for the benefit  of that country. The king had absolute confidence in him, and his advice  was ever on the side of resistance to popular demands. In England the  chief power was given to Archbishop Land, a high church prelate, bent  upon restoring many of the forms of Catholic worship, and bitterly  opposed to the Puritan spirit which pervaded the great mass of the  English people.    So far the errors had been entirely upon the side of the king. The  demands of the Commons had been justified by precedent and  constitutional rule. The doings of the king were in equal opposition to  these. When at last the necessity of the situation compelled Charles to  summon a Parliament, he was met by them in a spirit of absolute  defiance. Before any vote of supply would he taken, the Commons insisted  upon the impeachment of Strafford, and Charles weakly consented to this.  The trial was illegally carried on, and the evidence weak and doubtful.  But the king's favorite was marked out for destruction, and to the joy  of the whole kingdom was condemned and executed. A similar fate befell  Laud, and encouraged by these successes, the demands of the Commons  became higher and higher.    The ultimatum which at last the Puritan party in Parliament delivered to  the king, was that no man should remain in the royal council who was not  agreeable to Parliament; that no deed of the king should have validity  unless it passed the council, and was attested under their hands; that  all the officers of the state and principal judges should be chosen with  consent of Parliament, and enjoy their offices for life; that none of  the royal family should marry without consent of Parliament or the  council; that the penal laws should be executed against Catholics; that  the votes of popish lords should not be received in the Peers, and that  bishops should be excluded from the House; that the reformation of the  liturgy and church government should be carried out according to the  advice of Parliament; that the ordinances which they had made with  regard to the militia should be submitted to; that the justice of  Parliament should pass upon all delinquents, that is, upon all officials  of the state and country who had assisted in carrying out the king's  ordinances for the raising of taxes; that a general pardon should he  granted, with such exceptions as should he advised by Parliament; that  the fort and castles should be disposed of by consent of Parliament;  and that no peers should be made but with the consent of both Houses.  They demanded also that they should have the power of appointing and  dismissing the royal ministers, of naming guardians for the royal  children, and of virtually controlling military, civil, and religious  affairs.    As it was clear that these demands went altogether beyond the rights of  the Commons, and that if the king submitted to them the power of the  country would be solely in their hands, while he himself would become a  cipher, he had no course open to him but to refuse assent, and to appeal  to the loyal nobility and gentry of the country.    It is true that many of these rights have since been obtained by the  Houses of Parliament; but it must be remembered that they were  altogether alien at the time to the position which the kings of England  had hitherto held, and that the body into whose hands they would be  intrusted would be composed solely of one party in the state, and that  this party would be controlled by the fanatical leaders and the  ministers of the sects opposed to the Established Church, which were at  that time bitter, narrow, and violent to an extent of which we have now  no conception.    The attitude thus assumed by Parliament drove from their ranks a great  many of the most intelligent and enlightened of those who had formerly  sided with them in their contest against the king. These gentlemen felt  that intolerable as was the despotic power of a king, still more  intolerable would it be to be governed by the despotic power of a group  of fanatics. The liberty of Englishmen was now as much threatened by the  Commons as it had been threatened by the king, and to loyal gentlemen  the latter alternative was preferable. Thus there were on both sides  earnest and conscientious men who grieved deeply at being forced to  draw swords in such a quarrel, and who felt that their choice of sides  was difficult in the extreme. Falkland was the typical soldier on the  royal side, Hampden on that of the Commons.    It is probable that were England divided to-morrow under the same  conditions, men would be equally troubled upon which side to range  themselves. At this period of the struggle, with the exception of a few  hot-headed followers of the king and a few zealots on the side of the  Commons, there was a general hope that matters would shortly be  arranged, and that one conflict would settle the struggle.    The first warlike demonstration was made before the town of York, before  whose walls the king, arriving with an armed force, was refused  admittance by Sir John Hotham, who held the place for the Parliament.  This was the signal for the outbreak of the war, and each party  henceforth strained every nerve to arm themselves and to place their  forces in the field.    The above is but a brief sketch of the circumstances which led the  Cavaliers and Puritans of England to arm themselves for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11568"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Goodness of temper may be defined, to use the happy imagery of Gray,  \"as the sunshine of the heart.\" It is a more valuable bosom-attendant  under the pressure of poverty and adversity, and when we are  approaching the confines of infirmity and old age, than when we are  revelling in the full tide of plenty, amid the exuberant strength and  freshness of youth. Lord Bacon, who has analyzed some of the human  accompaniments so well, is silent as to the softening sway and  pleasing influence of this choice attuner of the human mind. But  Shaftesbury, the illustrious author of the _Characteristics_, was so  enamoured of it, that he terms \"gravity (its counterpart,) the essence  of imposture;\" and so it is, for to what purpose does a man store his  brain with knowledge, and the profitable burden of the sciences, if he  gathers only superciliousness and pride from the hedge of learning?  instead of the milder traits of general affection, and the open  qualities of social feelings. I remember, when a youth, I was  extremely fond of attending the House of Commons, to hear the debates;  and I shall never forget the repulsive loftiness which I thought  marked the physiognomy of Pitt; harsh and unbending, like a settled  frost, he seemed wrapped in the mantle of egotism and sublunary  conceit; and it was from the uninviting expression of this great man's  countenance, that I first drew my conceptions as to how a proud and  unsociable man looked. With very different emotions I was wont to  survey the mild but expressive features of his great opponent, Fox:  there was a placidity mixed up with the graver lines of thought and  reflection, that would have invited a child to take him by the hand;  indeed, the witchcraft of Mr. Fox's temper was such, that it formed a  triumphant source of gratulation in the circle of his friends, from  the panegyric of the late Earl of Carlisle, during his boyish days at  Eton, to the prouder posthumous circles of fame with which the elegant  author of _The Pleasures of Memory_, has entwined his sympathetic  recollections. The late Mr. Whitbread, although an unflinching  advocate for the people's rights, and an incorruptible patriot in  the true sense of the word, was unpopular in his office as a country  magistrate, owing to a tone of severity he generally used to those  around him. The wife of that indefatigable toiler in the Christian  field, John Wesley, was so acid and acrimonious in her temper, that  that mild advocate for spiritual affection, found it impossible to  live with her. Rousseau was tormented by such a host of ungovernable  passions, that he became a burden to himself and to every one around  him. Lord Byron suffered a badness of temper to corrode him in the  flower of his days. Contrasted with this unpleasing part of the  perspective, let us quote the names of a few wise and good men, who  have been proverbial for the goodness of their tempers; as Shakspeare,  Francis I., and Henry IV. of France; \"the great and good Lord  Lyttleton,\" as he is called to the present day; John Howard,  Goldsmith, Sir Samuel Romilly, Franklin, Thomson, the poet,  Sheridan,[2] and Sir Walter Scott. The late Sir William Curtis was  known to be one of the best tempered men of his day, which made him a  great favourite with the late king. I remember a little incident of  Sir William's good-nature, which occurred about a year after he had  been Lord Mayor. In alighting from his carriage, a little out of the  regular line, near the Mansion House, upon some day of festivity, he  happened inadvertently, with the skirts of his coat, to brush down a  few apples from a poor woman's stall, on the side of the pavement. Sir  William was in full dress, but instead of passing on with the hauteur  which characterizes so many of his aldermanic brethren, he set himself  to the task of assisting the poor creature to collect her scattered  fruit; and on parting, observing some of her apples were a little  soiled by the dirt, he drew his hand from his pocket and generously  gave her a shilling. This was too good an incident for John Bull to  lose: a crowd assembled, hurraed, and cried out, \"Well done, Billy,\"  at which the good-natured baronet looked back and laughed. How much  more pleasing is it to tell of such demeanour than of the foolish  pride of the late Sir John Eamer, who turned away one of his  travellers merely because he had in one instance used his bootjack.        [2] May we not, however, say the friendless Sheridan?    _The Author of \"A Tradesman's Lays.\"_           *       *       *       *       *    Probably our correspondent may recollect Sir William and the orange,  at one of the contested City elections. A \"greasy rogue\" before the  hustings, seeing the baronet candidate take an orange from his pocket,  _put up_ for the fruit, with the cry \"Give us that orange, Billy.\" Sir  William threw him the fruit, which the fellow had no sooner sucked  dry, than he began bawling with increased energy, \"No Curtis,\" \"No  Billy,\" etc. Such an ungrateful act would have soured even Seneca; but  Sir William merely gave a smile, with a good-natured shake of the  head. Sir William Curtis possessed a much greater share of shrewdness  and good sense than the vulgar ever gave him credit for. At the  Sessions' dinners, he would keep up the ball of conversation with the  judges and gentlemen of the bar, in a fuller vein than either of his  brother aldermen. It is true that he had wealth and distinction,  all which his fellow citizens at table did not enjoy; and these  possessions, we know, are wonderful helps to confidence, if they do  not lead the holder on to assurance.--Ed. M.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SKETCH BOOK.           *       *       *       *       *    EXTRACTS FROM THE ORIGINAL LETTERS OF AN OFFICER IN INDIA.[3]      _THE SIGHT OF A TIGER._[4]      Secunderabad, 1828.    A short time since, a brother sub. in my regiment was riding out round  some hills adjoining the cantonment, when a _cheetar_, small tiger  (or panther,) pounced on his dog. Seeing his poor favourite in the  cheetar's mouth, like a mouse in Minette's, he put spurs to his horse,  rode after the beast, and so frightened him, that he dropped the dog  and made off. Three of us, including myself, then agreed to sit up  that night, and watch for the tiger, feeling assured that his haunt  was not far from our cantonment. So we started late at night, armed  _cap-a-pied_, and each as fierce in heart as ten tigers; arrived  at the appointed spot, and having selected a convenient place for  concealment, we picketed a sheep, brought with us purposely to entice  the cheetar from his lair. Singular to relate, this poor animal, as if  instinctively aware of its critical situation, was as mute as if  it had been mouthless, and during two or three hours in which we  tormented it, to make it utter a cry, our efforts were of no avail.  Hour after hour slipped away, still no cheetar; and about three  o'clock in the morning, wearied with our fruitless vigil, we all began  to drop asleep. I believe I was wrapped in a most leaden slumber, and  dreaming of anything but watching for, and hunting tigers, when I was  aroused by the most unnatural, unearthly, and infernal roaring ever  heard. This was our friend, and for his reception, starting upon our  feet, we were all immediately ready; but the cunning creature who  had no idea of becoming our victim, made off, with the most hideous  howlings, to the shelter of a neighbouring eminence; when sufficient  daylight appeared, we followed the direction of his voice, and had the  felicity of seeing him perched on the summit of an immense high rock,  just before us, placidly watching our movements. We were here, too far  from him to venture a shot, but immediately began ascending, when the  creature seeing us approach, rose, opened his ugly red mouth in a  desperate yawn, and stretched himself with the utmost _nonchalance_,  being, it seems, little less weary than ourselves. We presented, but  did not fire, because at that very moment, setting up his tail, and  howling horribly, he disappeared behind the rock. Quick as thought  we followed him, but to our great disappointment and chagrin, he had  retreated into one of the numerous caverns formed in that ugly place,  by huge masses of rock, piled one upon the other. Into some of these  dangerous places, however, we descended, sometimes creeping, sometimes  walking, in search of our foe; but not finding him, at length returned  to"]]]
