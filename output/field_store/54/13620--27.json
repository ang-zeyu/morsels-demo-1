Is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an enemy who has  surprised a secret vital to the safety of one's self and comrades--an  enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its  numbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint,  and saw the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising,  falling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand  fell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested  on the leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy  soldier was near swooning from intensity of emotion.    It was not for long; in another moment his face was raised from earth,  his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger sought the  trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason sound.  He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him  dashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was  plain: the man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a  moment's spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken  prayer, he must be sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may  have discovered nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the  landscape. If permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the  direction whence he came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the  instant of his withdrawing whether he knows. It may well be that his  fixity of attention--Druse turned his head and looked through the deeps  of air downward, as from the surface to the bottom of a translucent sea.  He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men  and horses--some foolish commander was permitting the soldiers of his  escort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a dozen  summits!    Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the  group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights  of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as  if they were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their  parting: \"Whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty.\" He  was calm now. His teeth were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves  were as tranquil as a sleeping babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle  of his body; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim,  was regular and slow. Duty had conquered; the spirit had said to the  body: \"Peace, be still.\" He fired.    III    An officer of the Federal force, who in a spirit of adventure or in  quest of knowledge had left the hidden _bivouac_ in the valley, and with  aimless feet had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space  near the foot of the cliff, was considering what he had to gain by  pushing his exploration further. At a distance of a quarter-mile before  him, but apparently at a stone's throw, rose from its fringe of pines  the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a height above him that  it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a sharp, rugged line  against the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile against a  background of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant  hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base.  Lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an  astonishing sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley  through the air!    Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in  the saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too  impetuous a plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward,  waving like a plume. His hands were concealed in the cloud of the  horse's lifted mane. The animal's body was as level as if every  hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its motions were those of a  wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all the  legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap. But  this was a flight!    Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the  sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse,  the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs  failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing  sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was  still.    The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an  abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he  ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its  foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he  naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination  had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of  the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of  march of aerial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the  objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later  he returned to camp.    This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible  truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked  him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the  expedition he answered:    \"Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the  southward.\"    The commander, knowing better, smiled.    IV    After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and  resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant  crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his  head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.    \"Did you fire?\" the sergeant whispered.    \"Yes.\"    \"At what?\"    \"A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is  no longer there. It went over the cliff.\"    The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having  answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not  understand.    \"See here, Druse,\" he said, after a moment's silence, \"it's no use  making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the  horse?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well?\"    \"My father.\"    The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. \"Good God!\" he said.          AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE    I    A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down  into the swift water twenty feet below. The man's hands were behind his  back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck.  It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack  fell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the sleepers  supporting the metals of the railway supplied a footing for him and his  executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a  sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short  remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of  his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge  stood with his rifle in the position known as \"support,\" that is to say,  vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the  forearm thrown straight across the chest--a formal and unnatural  position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to  be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the centre of  the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that  traversed it.    Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran  straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost  to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of  the stream was open ground--a gentle acclivity topped with a stockade of  vertical tree trunks, loop-holed for rifles, with a single embrasure  through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the  bridge. Mid-way of the slope between bridge and fort were the  spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at \"parade rest,\" the  butts of the rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly  backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A  lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon  the ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of  four at the centre of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the  bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of  the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain  stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates,  but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is  to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most  familiar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity  are forms of deference.    The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five  years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit,  which was that of a planter. His features were good--a straight nose,  firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed  straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well-fitting  frock-coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his  eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one  would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently  this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision  for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.    The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside  and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The  sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately  behind that officer, who in turn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],[0,"Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#2)"],[1,"nature must decay;  I yield my body to the dust  To dwell with fellow-clay.    2 Yet faith may triumph o'er the grave,  And trample on the tombs:  My Jesus, my Redeemer lives,  My God, my Saviour comes.    3 The mighty Conqueror shall appear  High on a royal seat,  And Death, the last of all his foes,  Lie vanquish'd at his feet.    4 Tho' greedy worms devour my skin,  And gnaw my wasting flesh,  When God shall build my bones again,  He clothes them all afresh.    5 Then shall I see thy lovely face  With strong immortal eyes,  And feast upon thy unknown grace  With pleasure and surprise.      Hymn 1:7.  The invitation of the gospel; or, Spiritual  food and clothing, Isa. 55. 1 &c.    1 Let every mortal ear attend,  And every heart rejoice,  The trumpet of the gospel sounds  With an inviting voice.    2 Ho, all ye hungry starving souls,  That feed upon the wind,  And vainly strive with earthly toys  To fill an empty mind,    3 Eternal wisdom has prepar'd  A soul reviving feast,  And bids your longing appetites  The rich provision taste.    4 Ho, ye that pant for living streams,  And pine away and die,  Here you may quench your raging thirst  With springs that never dry.    5 Rivers of love and mercy here  In a rich ocean join;  Salvation in abundance flows,  Like floods of milk and wine.    6 [Ye perishing and naked poor,  Who work with mighty pain  To weave a garment of your own  That will not hide your sin,    7 Come naked, and adorn your souls  In robes prepar'd by God,  Wrought by the labours of his Son,  And dy'd in his own blood.]    8 Dear God, the treasures of thy love  Are everlasting mines,  Deep as our helpless miseries are,  And boundless as our sins.    9 The happy gates of gospel grace  Stand open night and day,  Lord, we are come to seek supplies,  And drive our wants away.      Hymn 1:8.  The safety and protection of the church, Isa. 26. 1-6.    1 How honourable is the place  Where we adoring stand,  Zion the glory of the earth,  And beauty of the land!    2 Bulwarks of mighty grace defend  The city where we dwell,  The walls of strong salvation made,  Defy th' assaults of hell.    3 Lift up the everlasting gates,  The doors wide open fling,  Enter, ye nations, that obey  The statutes of our King.    4 Here you shall taste unmingled joys,  And live in perfect peace,  You that have known Jehovah's name,  And ventur'd on his grace.    5 Trust in the Lord, for ever trust,  And banish all your fears;  Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells,  Eternal as his years.    6 [What tho' the rebels dwell on high,  His arm shall bring them low,  Low' as the caverns of the grave  Their lofty heads shall bow.]    7 [On Babylon our feet shall tread  In that rejoicing hour,  The ruins of her walls shall spread  A pavement for the poor.]      Hymn 1:9.  The promises of the covenant of grace, Isa. 55. 1 2.  Zech. 13. 1. Mich. 7. 19. Ezek. 36. 25 &c.    1 In vain we lavish out our lives  To gather empty wind,  The choicest blessings earth can yield  Will starve a hungry mind.    2 Come and the Lord shall feed our souls  With more substantial meat,  With such as saints in glory love,  With such as angels eat.    3 Our God will every want supply,  And fill our hearts with peace;  He gives by covenant and by oath  The riches of his grace.    4 Come, and he'll cleanse our spotted souls,  And wash away our stains,  In the dear fountain that his Son  Pour'd from his dying veins.    5 [Our guilt shall vanish all away  Tho' black as hell before;  Our sins shall sink beneath the sea,  And shall be found no more.    6 And lest pollution should o'erspread  Our inward powers again,  His Spirit shall bedew our souls  Like purifying rain.]    7 Our heart, that flinty stubborn thing,  That terrors cannot move,  That fears no threat'nings of his wrath,  Shall be dissolv'd by love;    8 Or he can take the flint away  That would not be refin'd,  And from the treasures of his grace  Bestow a softer mind.    9 There shall his sacred Spirit dwell,  And deep engrave his law,  And every motion of our souls  To swift obedience draw.    10 Thus will he pour salvation down,  And we shall render praise,  We the dear people of his love,  And he our God of grace.

Who bring salvation on their tongues,  And words of peace reveal!    2 How charming is their voice!  How sweet the tidings are!  \"Zion, behold thy Saviour King,  He reigns and triumphs here.\"    3 How happy are our ears  That hear this joyful sound,  Which kings and prophets waited for,  And sought, but never found!    4 How blessed are our eyes  That see this heavenly light!  Prophets and kings desir'd it long,  But dy'd without the sight.    5 The watchmen join their voice,  And tuneful notes employ;  Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,  And deserts leant the joy.    6 The Lord makes bare his arm  Thro' all the earth abroad  Let every nation now behold  Their Saviour and their God.      Hymn 1:11.  The humble enlightened, and carnal reason humbled;  or, The sovereignty of grace, Luke 10. 21 22    1 There was an hour when Christ rejoic'd,  And spoke his joy in words of praise;  \"Father, I thank thee, mighty God,  \"Lord of the earth, and heavens, and seas.    2 \"I thank thy sovereign power and love,  \"That crowns my doctrine with success;  \"And makes the babes in knowledge learn  \"The heights, and breadths, and lengths of grace.    3 \"But all this glory lies conceal'd  \"From men of prudence and of wit;  \"The prince of darkness blinds their eyes,  \"And their own pride resists the light.    4 \"Father, 'tis thus, because thy will  \"Chose and ordain'd it should be so;  \"T'is thy delight t' abase the proud,  \"And lay the haughty scorner low.    5 \"There's none can know the Father right  \"But those who learn it from the Son;  \"Nor can the Son be well receiv'd,  But where the Father makes him known.\"    6 Then let our souls adore our God  That deals his graces as he please,  Nor gives to mortals an account  Or of his actions, or decrees.      Hymn 1:12.  Free grace in revealing Christ, Luke 10. 21.    1 Jesus, the man of constant grief,  A mourner all his days;  His spirit once rejoic'd aloud,  And tun'd his joy to praise.    2 \"Father, I thank thy wondrous love,  \"That hath reveal'd thy Son  \"To men unlearned; and to babes  \"Has made thy gospel known.    3 \"The mysteries of redeeming grace  \"Are hidden from the wise,  \"While pride and carnal reasonings join  \"To swell and blind their eyes.\"    4 Thus doth the Lord of heaven and earth  His great decrees fulfil,  And orders all his works of grace  By his own sovereign will.      Hymn 1:13.  The Son of God incarnate; or, The titles and the  kingdom of Christ, Isa. 9. 2 6 7.    1 The lands that long in darkness lay  Now have beheld a heavenly light;  Nations that sat in death's cold shade  Are bless'd with beams divinely bright.    2 The virgin's promis'd Son is born,  Behold th' expected Child appear;  What shall his names or titles be?  The Wonderful, the Counsellor.    3 This infant is the mighty God  Come to be suckled and ador'd  Th' eternal Father, Prince of Peace,  The son of David, and his Lord.    4 The government of earth and seas  Upon his shoulders shall be laid  His wide dominions still increase,  And honours to his name be paid.    5 Jesus the holy child shall sit  High on his father David's throne,  Shall crush his foes beneath his feet,  And reign to ages yet unknown.      Hymn 1:14.  The triumph of faith; or, Christ's unchangeable love,  Rom. 8. 33 &c.    1 Who shall the Lord's elect condemn?  'Tis God that justifies their souls,  And mercy like a mighty stream  O'er all their sins divinely rolls.      2 Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?  'Tis Christ that suffer'd in their stead,  And the salvation to fulfil,  Behold him rising from the dead.    3 He lives, he lives, and sits above,  For ever interceding there:  Who shall divide us from his love?  Or what should tempt us to despair?    4 Shall persecution, or distress,  Famine, or sword, or nakedness?  He that hath lov'd us bears us thro',  And makes us more than conquerors too.    5 Faith hath an overcoming power,  It triumphs in the dying hour;  Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,  Nor can we sink with such a prop.    6 Not all that men on earth can do,  Nor powers on high, nor powers below,  Shall cause his mercy to remove,  Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.      Hymn 1:15.  Our own weakness, and Christ our strength,  2 Cor. 12. 7 9 10.    1 Let me but hear my Saviour say,  \"Strength shall be equal to thy day,\"  Then I rejoice in deep distress,  Leaning on all-sufficient Grace.    2 I glory in infirmity,  That Christ's own power may rest on me;  When I am weak, then am I strong,  Grace is my shield, and Christ my song.    3 I can do all things, or can bear  All sufferings, if my Lord be there;  Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains,  While his left hand my head sustains.    4 But if the Lord be once withdrawn,  And we attempt the work alone,  When new temptations spring and rise  We find how great our weakness is.    5 [So Samson, when his hair was lost,  Met the Philistines to his cost;  Shook his vain limbs with sad surprise,  Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes.]      Hymn 1:16.  Hosanna to Christ, Matt. 21. 9. Luke 19. 38 40.    1 Hosanna to the royal Son  Of David's ancient line,  His natures two, his person one,  Mysterious and divine.    2 The root of David here we find,  And offspring is the same;  Eternity and time are join'd  In our Immanuel's name.    3 Bless'd he that comes to wretched men  With peaceful news from heaven;  Hosannas of the highest strain  To Christ the Lord be given.    4 Let mortals ne'er refuse to take  Th' hosanna on their tongues,  Lest rocks and stones should rise, and break  Their silence into songs.
