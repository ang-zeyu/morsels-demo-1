I was to receive no wages for the  first six months. My father counseled the merchant to work me hard,  and, if possible, cure me of the \"foolish notion,\" as he termed it.  The storekeeper cured me. The first week I was with him he kept me in  a back warehouse shelling corn. The second week started out no better.  I was given a shovel and put on the street to work out the poll-tax,  not only of the merchant but of two other clerks in the store. Here  was two weeks' work in sight, but the third morning I took breakfast  at home. My mercantile career had ended, and forthwith I took to the  range as a preacher's son takes to vice. By the time I was twenty  there was no better cow-hand in the entire country. I could, besides,  speak Spanish and play the fiddle, and thought nothing of riding  thirty miles to a dance. The vagabond temperament of the range I  easily assimilated.    Christmas in the South is always a season of festivity, and the magnet  of mother and home yearly drew us to the family hearthstone. There we  brothers met and exchanged stories of our experiences. But one year  both my brothers brought home a new experience. They had been up the  trail, and the wondrous stories they told about the northern country  set my blood on fire. Until then I thought I had had adventures, but  mine paled into insignificance beside theirs. The following summer, my  eldest brother, Robert, himself was to boss a herd up the trail, and I  pleaded with him to give me a berth, but he refused me, saying: \"No,  Tommy; the trail is one place where a foreman can have no favorites.  Hardship and privation must be met, and the men must throw themselves  equally into the collar. I don't doubt but you're a good hand; still  the fact that you're my brother might cause other boys to think I  would favor you. A trail outfit has to work as a unit, and dissensions  would be ruinous.\" I had seen favoritism shown on ranches, and  understood his position to be right. Still I felt that I must make  that trip if it were possible. Finally Robert, seeing that I was  overanxious to go, came to me and said: \"I've been thinking that if I  recommended you to Jim Flood, my old foreman, he might take you with  him next year. He is to have a herd that will take five months from  start to delivery, and that will be the chance of your life. I'll see  him next week and make a strong talk for you.\"    True to his word, he bespoke me a job with Flood the next time he met  him, and a week later a letter from Flood reached me, terse and  pointed, engaging my services as a trail hand for the coming summer.  The outfit would pass near our home on its way to receive the cattle  which were to make up the trail herd. Time and place were appointed  where I was to meet them in the middle of March, and I felt as if I  were made. I remember my mother and sisters twitted me about the  swagger that came into my walk, after the receipt of Flood's letter,  and even asserted that I sat my horse as straight as a poker.  Possibly! but wasn't I going up the trail with Jim Flood, the boss  foreman of Don Lovell, the cowman and drover?    Our little ranch was near Cibollo Ford on the river, and as the outfit  passed down the country, they crossed at that ford and picked me up.  Flood was not with them, which was a disappointment to me, \"Quince\"  Forrest acting as _segundo_ at the time. They had four mules to the  \"chuck\" wagon under Barney McCann as cook, while the _remuda_, under  Billy Honeyman as horse wrangler, numbered a hundred and forty-two,  ten horses to the man, with two extra for the foreman. Then, for the  first time, I learned that we were going down to the mouth of the Rio  Grande to receive the herd from across the river in Old Mexico; and  that they were contracted for delivery on the Blackfoot Indian  Reservation in the northwest corner of Montana. Lovell had several  contracts with the Indian Department of the government that year, and  had been granted the privilege of bringing in, free of duty, any  cattle to be used in filling Indian contracts.    My worst trouble was getting away from home on the morning of  starting. Mother and my sisters, of course, shed a few tears; but my  father, stern and unbending in his manner, gave me his benediction in  these words: \"Thomas Moore, you're the third son to leave our roof,  but your father's blessing goes with you. I left my own home beyond  the sea before I was your age.\" And as they all stood at the gate, I  climbed into my saddle and rode away, with a lump in my throat which  left me speechless to reply.        CHAPTER II    RECEIVING    It was a nice ten days' trip from the San Antonio to the Rio Grande  River. We made twenty-five to thirty miles a day, giving the saddle  horses all the advantage of grazing on the way. Rather than hobble,  Forrest night-herded them, using five guards, two men to the watch of  two hours each. \"As I have little hope of ever rising to the dignity  of foreman,\" said our _segundo_, while arranging the guards, \"I'll  take this occasion to show you varmints what an iron will I possess.  With the amount of help I have, I don't propose to even catch a night  horse; and I'll give the cook orders to bring me a cup of coffee and a  cigarette before I arise in the morning. I've been up the trail before  and realize that this authority is short-lived, so I propose to make  the most of it while it lasts. Now you all know your places, and see  you don't incur your foreman's displeasure.\"    The outfit reached Brownsville on March 25th, where we picked up Flood  and Lovell, and dropping down the river about six miles below Fort  Brown, went into camp at a cattle ford known as Paso Ganado. The Rio  Grande was two hundred yards wide at this point, and at its then stage  was almost swimming from bank to bank. It had very little current, and  when winds were favorable the tide from the Gulf ran in above the  ford. Flood had spent the past two weeks across the river, receiving  and road-branding the herd, so when the cattle should reach the river  on the Mexican side we were in honor bound to accept everything  bearing the \"circle dot\"   the left hip. The contract called for a  thousand she cattle, three and four years of age, and two thousand  four and five year old beeves, estimated as sufficient to fill a  million-pound beef contract. For fear of losses on the trail, our  foreman had accepted fifty extra head of each class, and our herd at  starting would number thirty-one hundred head. They were coming up  from ranches in the interior, and we expected to cross them the first  favorable day after their arrival. A number of different rancheros had  turned in cattle in making up the herd, and Flood reported them in  good, strong condition.    Lovell and Flood were a good team of cowmen. The former, as a youth,  had carried a musket in the ranks of the Union army, and at the end of  that struggle, cast his fortune with Texas, where others had seen  nothing but the desolation of war, Lovell saw opportunities of  business, and had yearly forged ahead as a drover and beef contractor.  He was well calculated to manage the cattle business, but was  irritable and inclined to borrow trouble, therefore unqualified  personally to oversee the actual management of a cow herd. In repose,  Don Lovell was slow, almost dull, but in an emergency was  astonishingly quick-witted and alert. He never insisted on temperance  among his men, and though usually of a placid temperament, when out of  tobacco--Lord!    Jim Flood, on the other hand, was in a hundred respects the antithesis  of his employer. Born to the soil of Texas, he knew nothing but  cattle, but he knew them thoroughly. Yet in their calling, the pair  were a harmonious unit. He never crossed a bridge till he reached it,  was indulgent with his men, and would overlook any fault, so long as  they rendered faithful service. Priest told me this incident: Flood  had hired a man at Red River the year before, when a self-appointed  guardian present called Flood to one side and said,--\"Don't you know  that that man you've just hired is the worst drunkard in this  country?\"    \"No, I didn't know it,\" replied Flood, \"but I'm glad to hear he is. I  don't want to ruin an innocent man, and a trail outfit is not supposed  to have any morals. Just so the herd don't count out shy on the day of  delivery, I don't mind how many drinks the outfit takes.\"    The next morning after going into camp, the first thing was the  allotment of our mounts for the trip. Flood had the first pick, and  cut twelve bays and browns. His preference for solid colors, though  they were not the largest in the _remuda_, showed his practical sense  of horses. When it came the boys' turn to cut, we were only allowed to  cut one at a time by turns, even casting lots for first choice. We had  ridden the horses enough to have a fair idea as to their merits, and  every lad was his own judge. There were, as it happened, only three  pinto horses in the entire saddle stock, and these three were the last  left of the entire bunch. Now a little boy or girl, and many an older  person, thinks that a spotted horse is the real thing, but practical  cattle men know that this freak of color in range-bred horses is the  result of in-and-in breeding, with consequent physical and mental  deterioration. It was my good fortune that morning to get a good mount  of horses,--three sorrels, two grays, two coyotes, a black, a brown,  and a _grulla_. The black was my second pick, and though the color is  not a hardy one, his \"bread-basket\" indicated that he could carry food  for a long ride, and ought to be a good swimmer. My judgment of him  was confirmed throughout the trip, as I used him for my night horse  and when we had swimming rivers to ford. I gave this black the name of  \"Nigger Boy.\"    For the trip each man was expected to furnish his own accoutrements.  In"]]]
