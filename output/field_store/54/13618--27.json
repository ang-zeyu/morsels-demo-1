He also saved quite a little money and  was able to give his daughter-in-law, in 1577, 1300 scudi; he is known  indeed, to have bought land, vineyards and houses in and about Rome.    All was not a life of sunshine for Palestrina, for he suffered many  domestic sorrows. His three promising sons died one after another.  They were talented young men, who might have followed in the footsteps  of their distinguished father. In 1580 his wife died also. Yet neither  poignant sorrow, worldly glory nor ascetic piety blighted his homely  affections. At the Jubilee of Pope Gregory XIII, in 1575, when 1500  pilgrims from the town of Palestrina descended the hills on the way  to Rome, it was their old townsman, Giovanni Pierluigi, who led their  songs, as they entered the Eternal City, their maidens clad in white  robes, and their young men bearing olive branches.    It is said of Palestrina that he became the \"savior of church music,\"  at a time when it had almost been decided to banish all music from the  service except the chant, because so many secular subjects had been  set to music and used in church. Things had come to a very difficult  pass, until at last the fathers turned to Palestrina, desiring him  to compose a mass in which sacred words should be heard throughout.  Palestrina, deeply realizing his responsibility, wrote not only one  but three, which, on being heard, pleased greatly by their piety,  meekness, and beautiful spirit. Feeling more sure of himself,  Palestrina continued to compose masses, until he had created  ninety-three in all. He also wrote many motets on the Song of Solomon,  his Stabat Mater, which was edited two hundred and fifty years later  by Richard Wagner, and his lamentations, which were composed at the  request of Sixtus V.    Palestrina's end came February 2, 1594. He died in Rome, a devout  Christian, and on his coffin were engraved the simple but splendid  words: \"Prince of Music.\"          II    JOHN SEBASTIAN BACH      Away back in 1685, almost two hundred and fifty years ago, one of the  greatest musicians of the world first saw the light, in the little  town of Eisenach, nestling on the edge of the Thuringen forest. The  long low-roofed cottage where little Johann Sebastian Bach was born,  is still standing, and carefully preserved.    The name Bach belonged to a long race of musicians, who strove to  elevate the growing art of music. For nearly two hundred years there  had been organists and composers in the family; Sebastian's father,  Johann Ambrosius Bach was organist of the Lutheran Church in Eisenach,  and naturally a love of music was fostered in the home. It is no  wonder that little Sebastian should have shown a fondness for music  almost from infancy. But, beyond learning the violin from his father,  he had not advanced very far in his studies, when, in his tenth  year he lost both his parents and was taken care of by his brother  Christoph, fourteen years older, a respectable musician and organist  in a neighboring town. To give his little brother lessons on the  clavier, and send him to the Lyceum to learn Latin, singing and other  school subjects seemed to Christoph to include all that could be  expected of him. That his small brother possessed musical genius of  the highest order, was an idea he could not grasp; or if he did, he  repressed the boy with indifference and harsh treatment.    Little Sebastian suffered in silence from this coldness. Fortunately  the force of his genius was too great to be crushed. He knew all the  simple pieces by heart, which his brother set for his lessons, and  he longed for bigger things. There was a book of manuscript music  containing pieces by Buxtehude and Frohberger, famous masters of the  time, in the possession of Christoph. Sebastian greatly desired to  play the pieces in that book, but his brother kept it under lock and  key in his cupboard, or bookcase. One day the child mustered courage  to ask permission to take the book for a little while. Instead of  yielding to the boy's request Christoph became angry, told him not to  imagine he could study such masters as Buxtehude and Frohberger, but  should be content to get the lessons assigned him.    The injustice of this refusal fired Sebastian with the determination  to get possession of the coveted book at all costs. One moonlight  night, long after every one had retired, he decided to put into  execution a project he had dreamed of for some time.    Creeping noiselessly down stairs he stood before the bookcase and  sought the precious volume. There it was with the names of the various  musicians printed in large letters on the back in his brother's  handwriting. To get his small hands between the bars and draw the book  outward took some time. But how to get it out. After much labor he  found one bar weaker than the others, which could be bent.    When at last the book was in his hands, he clasped it to his breast  and hurried quickly back to his chamber. Placing the book on a table  in front of the window, where the moonlight fell full upon it, he took  pen and music paper and began copying out the pieces in the book.    This was but the beginning of nights of endless toil. For six months  whenever there were moonlight nights, Sebastian was at the window  working at his task with passionate eagerness.    At last it was finished, and Sebastian in the joy of possessing it for  his very own, crept into bed without the precaution of putting  away all traces of his work. Poor boy, he had to pay dearly for his  forgetfulness. As he lay sleeping, Christoph, thinking he heard sounds  in his brother's room, came to seek the cause. His glance, as he  entered the room, fell on the open books. There was no pity in  his heart for all this devoted labor, only anger that he had been  outwitted by his small brother. He took both books away and hid them  in a place where Sebastian could never find them. But he did not  reflect that the boy had the memory of all this beautiful music  indelibly printed on his mind, which helped him to bear the bitter  disappointment of the loss of his work.    When he was fifteen Sebastian left his brother's roof and entered the  Latin school connected with the Church of St. Michael at Lueneburg. It  was found he had a beautiful soprano voice, which placed him with the  scholars who were chosen to sing in the church service in return for  a free education. There were two church schools in Lueneburg, and the  rivalry between them was so keen, that when the scholars sang in the  streets during the winter months to collect money for their support,  the routes for each had to be carefully marked out, to prevent  collision.    Soon after he entered St. Michael's, Bach lost his beautiful soprano  voice; his knowledge of violin and clavier, however, enabled him  to keep his place in the school. The boy worked hard at his musical  studies, giving his spare time to the study of the best composers. He  began to realize that he cared more for the organ than for any other  instrument; indeed his love for it became a passion. He was too  poor to take lessons, for he was almost entirely self-dependent--a  penniless scholar, living on the plainest of fare, yet determined to  gain a knowledge of the music he longed for.    One of the great organists of the time was Johann Adam Reinken. When  Sebastian learned that this master played the organ in St. Katharine's  Church in Hamburg, he determined to walk the whole distance thither to  hear him. Now Hamburg was called in those days the \"Paradise of German  music,\" and was twenty-five good English miles from the little town  of Lueneburg, but what did that matter to the eager lad? Obstacles only  fired him to strive the harder for what he desired to attain.    The great joy of listening to such a master made him forget the long  tramp and all the weariness, and spurred him on to repeat the journey  whenever he had saved a few shillings to pay for food and lodging. On  one occasion he lingered a little longer in Hamburg than usual, until  his funds were well-nigh exhausted, and before him was the long walk  without any food. As he trudged along he came upon a small inn, from  the open door of which came a delightful savory odor. He could not  resist looking in through the window. At that instant a window above  was thrown open and a couple of herrings' heads were tossed into the  road. The herring is a favorite article of food in Germany and poor  Sebastian was glad to pick up these bits to satisfy the cravings of  hunger. What was his surprise on pulling the heads to pieces to  find each one contained a Danish ducat. When he recovered from his  astonishment, he entered the inn and made a good meal with part of the  money; the rest ensured another visit to Hamburg.    After remaining three years in Lueneburg, Bach secured a post as  violinist in the private band of Prince Johann Ernst of Saxe-Weimar;  but this was only to fill the time till he could find a place to  play the instrument he so loved. An opportunity soon came. The old  Thuringian town Arnstadt had a new church and a fine new organ. The  consistory of the church were looking for a capable organist and  Bach's request to be allowed to try the instrument was readily  granted.    As soon as they heard him play they offered him the post, with promise  of increasing the salary by a contribution from the town funds. Bach  thus found himself at the age of eighteen installed as organist at a  salary of fifty florins, with thirty thalers in addition for board and  lodging, equal, all in all, to less than fifty dollars. In those days  this amount was considered a fair sum for a young player. On August  14, 1703, the young organist entered upon his duties, promising  solemnly to be diligent and faithful to all requirements.    The requirements of the post fortunately left him plenty of leisure to  study. Up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#2)"],[1,"make one _Samayana_. The subjective view of _Samadhi_ no books  or writings can teach you. As you go deeper and deeper into Yoga, you  will understand these things in the light of your Soul-Vision. It will  come to you if you follow my subsequent instructions. Despair not.      WHAT IS MAYA?    Now, first of all, what is Maya (ignorance of the real)? Take the  dial-plate of a watch. You know quite well that the hands of the watch  are governed by the mechanism behind. Both are necessary. Ignorance  exists in thinking that the hands of the watch move by themselves. This  visible universe is the dial-plate of the Invisible. Maya (ignorance)  blinds you to this fact, _i.e._, mere objective knowledge blinds you to  the subjective side of life and you see nothing beyond a material  universe. But you, who realize both, objective as well as subjective,  need not be afraid of such a danger. For a danger it is to develop the  objective mind at neglect of the subjective. In order to round yourself  out, practise both. _But first, last and always, let the subjective  guide, govern and illumine the objective_. Also remember this: If your  mind is at all attached to the objective world, try your very best to  disattach it and fix it on the subjective side of life, else will you  bring untold suffering on yourself. The half-wordly and half-spiritual  man who wants to lead a spiritual sensual life eventually brings about a  conflict between the laws and forces of the two planes of being. He is  overwhelmed with pain and at last with cries of suffering, disease and  loss, he is made to open his eyes. Understand the world for what it is  but do not lower your soul to the point of being attached to its small  thoughts, things and ways.      HOW TO CONCENTRATE OBJECTIVELY.    (_a_) In all undertakings whether of small or great importance shut  off all thoughts and ideas except such as have any immediate and direct  bearing upon the thing in hand. Pay attention. Bend all the energies  of your mind and will upon it till it is completed to your satisfaction.  Divert your attention from one thing to another only when you sanction  by a resolve and understand why you do so. Your daily work which you  must choose according to the special bent of your mind, will present you  opportunities.    (_b_) Control impulse. Suppose an idea enters your mind. Compose  yourself quietly before carrying out its purport. Consider it. Turn  it over in your mind. Contemplate it. Weave your mental energies  around it, as it were, till at last the idea with your final decision  stands out clear-cut and well-defined. Then proceed to act it out  physically with your mental concentration cutting a way for you straight  on to the execution of your designing. This is _forethought_.    (_c_) In perfect concentration time vanishes. In working out a  design on which you have set your heart dispense altogether with the  element of time and work at it concentratedly for days, months and  years with confident expectation of success.    (_d_) Take a picture, representing a landscape, the interior of a  building, an assembly of persons, a square, a triangle or a more  complicated geometrical figure. Look at it well. Then lay it aside. Close  your eyes. Reproduce the picture mentally in detail. Then repose your  mind on the same image to the exclusion of all other thoughts. This is  a more fixed and meditative method and will sharpen the mind wonderfully.  It will also develop the power of conscious Mental Imagery. The  key to Objective Concentration is _Conscious Attention_, remember.      ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MENTATION.    These terms imply two different distinct functions of the human  mind. The active function performs the volitional, voluntary thinking.  It is the conscious focusing of the mind on some mental problem.  Banishing from the mind all thoughts and ideas not in harmony with your  special subject of study implies Active Mentation. This function is used  by the active, wide-awake man in his busy and energetic moments. It  is the key to the development of Will-Power and a vigorous intellect.  You are conscious of effort when you are exercising this function. The  mind becomes exhausted after a great deal of such effort and cries out  for rest, because conscious attention implies close concentration of  thought and can be exercised only by the conscious use of Will-Power. You  ought to be able to concentrate upon one subject of thought, study and  observation with undivided attention and then take your mind off that  subject and put it on something else, at your will. Train your mind to  'give' perfect attention to any subject you like and also to 'shut off'  or inhibit all attention on that subject. The mind is a restless thing  darting from one thing to another, and, like a spoilt child, tiring of  continued attention. But you must, by Will-Exercise, get control over  this tendency. 'Exercise develops power. Practice makes perfect.' This  you must bear in mind and, by patience and perseverance, train your mind  to 'pay attention' where it ought to do so and not to pay attention where  it ought not to. At first your mind will rebel like an unbroken horse  at the imposition of such restraint. But really all greatness results  from mind-control. _Remember active mentation is conscious, deliberate  concentration. Passive mentation represents automatic, involuntary  thinking._ This includes the subconscious or 'habit' mind. When a certain  thought-groove has been formed in your mind, energy flows into it  involuntarily, _i.e._, by itself and without any conscious effort on your  part. This is passive mentation. It is automatic mental activity. Take an  example. Some school-boys find Mathematics, Science and Geography  easy to master from the very start. They feel quite in sympathy with the  teacher of Mathematics. But History and Language are their abomination.  There are others who simply cannot 'take an interest' in any  Mathematics but who shine brilliantly in Language, Recitation,  Composition, History. As a matter of fact neither of these students is  superior to the other, but each is great in his own line. In one set, you  have an example of automatic mentation in Mathematics, Science and  Geography; in the other in Literature and Art. But suppose the first set  tried to master Literature and Art and the second grappled with  Mathematics and Science, each would then be practising actual  concentration. In each set the active function would be exercised and  will-power would develop on both sides. Do you see? Occultists say that  all power results from the continual exercise of active mentation  and all weak-mindedness is the direct outcome of this wool-gathering,  castle-building, inattentive habit which is an extension of passive  mentation into useless channels of thought-force. Conscious attention  concentrates and even specializes mental energy as the sun-glass  concentrates and intensifies the heat of the rays of the sun. Focus your  full attention upon the thing to be done, take a keen interest in its  accomplishment to the exclusion of all else, and you will obtain  wonderful results. The man of developed, concentrative power holds in his  hand the key to success, with the results that all his actions, voluntary  or involuntary, are pointed to the accomplishment of his object. Remember  therefore in conclusion:    (1) Concentration is perfect attention consciously directed to a  given point of achievement either objectively or subjectively.    (2) Concentration is consecration.    \"What ever you do, do it with all your might. Do one thing at a time and  do it well.\" By concentration is meant the directing of all your energies  along a special line of achievement. For instance, if you would be a  perfect Yogi, you must concentrate, concentrate, morning, noon and night,  at all times, along that line of endeavour. You must study all the vast  literature on Yoga, Psychology, Metaphysics, Mentalism, etc., and form  your own synthesis on same. You must think hard and work hard for Yoga.  \"Genius is the power to bear infinite pain.\" Nothing ought to be too  great a sacrifice, including your own life, for the right understanding  and achievement of Yoga.    All half-heartedness, all insincerity, weakens your nature, and  weakness has no place either in heaven or in hell. For the half-hearted  man is a traitor unto the Divine within him and must pay dearly for  his treachery.      SUBJECTIVE CONCENTRATION--HOW PRACTISED.    This is a vast subject. If you practise earnestly my instructions on  Thought-Control, Will-Culture, and take the Meditation Exercise I am  going to give you, you will realize greater strength than average  humanity. But you must study and think hard for yourself before any  considerable benefit can be derived from even these. Remember please, you  alone can teach yourself through intuition. Intuition is tuition from  within. Follow strictly the general rules I give you and you cannot but  unfold your Inner Soul Vision which includes intuition in its fullest  sense.    _(a) What is Thought-Force?_    \"Thoughts are things.\" Thought is a dynamic energy. Just as the food that  you eat feeds your body, exactly similarly your thoughts and feelings  nourish your soul. Matter is nothing but a concentration of Thought-Force  or Mind-Substance. The entire universe is seen objectively. This is on  the cosmic scale. On the individual scale--\"As a man thinketh in his  heart, so he is.\" This is a literal truth. Your body is nothing but a  Thought-Form. Control your modes of thinking and shape them to lofty  ideals. So will you infallibly, positively and immediately control your  destiny. Control your thoughts and you can control the thoughts of all  other men. The tone of your thoughts must always be lofty. You must  change your Thought-Habits and shift your plane of consciousness from the  lower to the higher life. I am going to give"]]]
