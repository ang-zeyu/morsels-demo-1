I saw it in your faces; but, 'tis  too absurd! Why, he's your father's friend, and nearly as old.\"    \"All the wiser and better for that, Carrie, dear. But he is young in  heart, and far from looking old, I think. I have grown so sick of your  silly, brainless fops, who expect women neither to talk sense nor  understand it.\"    \"Ah, I dare say! and Mr. Travilla is the most sensible and polished of  men--always excepting my own spouse, of course. And you won't be taken  away from us; so I give my consent.\"    Elsie's only answer was a mirthful, amused look.    \"Oh, but I am glad to see you back!\" Carrie ran on. \"It seems an age since  you went away.\"    \"Thank you. And your husband? what is he like?\"    \"I was never good at description, but he is a fine specimen of a Kentucky  planter, and very fond of his wife. By the way, you must blame me that  Edward and Lora were so late in welcoming you home. I arrived only  yesterday morning, quite fatigued with my journey, and begged them to wait  till to-day, and bring me with them.\"    \"That was right. We have not seen Enna yet, or Arthur. Grandpa and Mrs.  Dinsmore and Walter called yesterday. But there is the dinner-bell. Let me  conduct you to the dining-room.\"    They were just in time to sit down with the others.    Elsie quickly perceived by her Aunt Lora's look and manner, that she, too,  had heard the news, but no remark was make on the subject till the ladies  had retired to the drawing-room, leaving the gentlemen to the enjoyment of  their after-dinner cigars.    Then Mrs. Howard, facing round upon her niece as they entered the room,  exclaimed, \"Elsie, you naughty child! are you not ashamed of yourself?\"    \"On account of what, auntie?\"    \"Such unconscious innocence!\" cried Lora, throwing up the white and  jeweled hands she had rested lightly for an instant upon the young girl's  shoulder, while gazing steadily into the smiling, blushing, sparkling  face. \"You haven't been planning and promising to give Adelaide and me a  nephew older than ourselves? I tell you, miss, I refuse my consent. Why,  it's absurd! the very idea! I used to think him almost an elderly  gentleman when you were a chit of eight or nine.\"    \"I remember having had some such idea myself; but he must have been  growing young since then,\" returned Elsie, demurely.    \"He seems to have been standing still (waiting for you, I suppose); but I  never was more astonished in my life!\" said Lora, dropping into a chair.    \"It has been a genuine surprise to us all,\" remarked Rose.    \"To me as much as anyone, mamma,\" said Elsie. \"I--had thought he was  engaged to you, Aunt Adie.\"    \"To _me_, child!\"    \"Why, my dear, I surely told you about her engagement to my brother  Edward?\" exclaimed Adelaide and Rose simultaneously.    \"You tried, mamma, and it was all my own fault that I did not hear the  whole truth. And, Aunt Adie, I cannot understand how he could ever fancy  me, while he might have hoped there was a possibility of winning you.\"    \"'Twould have been a much more suitable match,\" said Lora. \"Though I'd  have preferred the one in contemplation, except that in the other case,  she would not be carried quite away from us. But suppose we proceed to  business. We should have a double wedding, I think.\"    \"Oh, don't talk of it yet,\" said Rose, with a slight tremble in her voice,  and looking at Elsie's flushed, conscious face with eyes full of unshed  tears. \"Adelaide's is to be within the next two months, and--we cannot  give up Elsie so suddenly.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Adelaide; \"and I should have serious objections to  being used as a foil to Elsie's youth and beauty.\"    The Howards and Mr. Travilla stayed to tea, and shortly before that meal  the party was increased by the arrival of Walter Dinsmore and Mrs. Dick  Percival.    Enna had lost flesh and color; and long indulgence of a fretful, peevish  temper had drawn down the corners of her mouth, lined her forehead, and  left its ugly pencilings here and there over the once pretty face, so that  it already began to look old and care-worn. She was very gayly dressed, in  the height of the fashion, and rather overloaded with jewelry; but powder  and rouge could not altogether conceal the ravages of discontent and  passion. She was conscious of the fact, and inwardly dwelt with  mortification and chagrin upon the contrast presented by her own faded  face to that of Elsie, so fair and blooming, so almost childish in its  sweet purity and innocence of expression.    \"So you are single yet,\" Enna said, with a covert sneer; \"and not likely  to marry either, so far as I've been able to learn. They'll soon begin to  call you an old maid.\"    \"Will they?\" said Mr. Dinsmore, with a laugh in which all present joined,  Enna herself excepted; \"well, if she is a fair specimen of that  much-abused class, they are far more attractive than is generally  supposed.\"    \"You needn't laugh,\" said Enna; \"I was four years younger than she is now,  when I married. I wasn't going to wait till they began to call me an old  maid.\"    \"To bear that reproach is not the worst calamity that can befall a woman,\"  replied Mr. Dinsmore gravely; then changed the subject by a kind inquiry  in regard to Arthur.    \"Slowly and steadily improving,\" answered Walter. \"The doctors are now  satisfied that he is not permanently crippled, though he still uses a  crutch.\"          CHAPTER SECOND.        \"Mutual love, the crown of all our bliss.\"                       --MILTON'S PARADISE LOST.      After a half hour of waiting for her son's return, Mrs. Travilla sat down  to her lonely cup of tea. There was no lack of delicacies on the table,  and in all Edward's taste had been consulted. To make him comfortable and  happy was, next to serving her God, the great aim and object of his  mother's life; and, in a less degree, of that of every servant in the  house. They had all been born and brought up at Ion, and had all these  years known him as the kindest, most reasonable and considerate of  masters.    \"Wish Massa Edard come. Dese waffles jes' prime to-night, an' he so fond  ob dem,\" remarked a pretty mulatto girl, handing a plate of them to her  mistress.    \"Yes, Prilla, he expected to be at home, but is probably taking tea at the  Oaks or Roselands.\" And the old lady supped her tea and ate her waffles  with a serene, happy face, now and then lighted up by a pleased smile  which her attendant handmaiden was at a loss to interpret.    Having finished her meal, Mrs. Travilla threw a shawl about her shoulders  and stepped out upon the veranda; then, tempted by the beauty of the  night, walked down the avenue to meet her son or see if there were any  signs of his approach.    She had not gone half the distance ere the sound of horses' hoofs reached  her ear--distant at first but coming rapidly nearer, till a lady and  gentleman drew rein at the gate, while the servant who had been riding in  the rear dismounted and threw it open.    They came dashing up, but paused and drew rein again at sight of the old  lady standing there under the trees.    \"Mother,\" cried her son, springing from the saddle, \"you were not alarmed?  anxious? surely.\"    \"No, no, Edward, but glad to see you and Elsie! my dear child, this is  very kind.\"    \"Not at all, dear Mrs. Travilla; it is so lovely an evening for a ride; or  walk either,\" she added, giving her hand to her escort and springing  lightly to the ground.    Mr. Travilla put the hand into that of his mother. \"Take her to your  heart, mother; she is mine--ours!\" he said, in low tones tremulous with  joy.    The old lady folded the slight girlish form to her breast for a moment,  with a silence more eloquent than words.    \"Thank God! thank God!\" she murmured at length. \"He has given me my  heart's desire;\" and mingled caresses and tears fell upon Elsie's face.  \"For many years I have loved you as my own child, and now I am to have  you. How bright our home will be, Edward. But we are darkening another.  Her father; can he--has he----\"    \"He has given her to me,\" answered the son quickly, \"and she has--we have  given ourselves to each other. Let me give an arm to each of you and we  will go into the house.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The veranda at the Oaks was deserted, and the house very quiet, though  lights still shone here and there, as Mr. Travilla and Elsie rode up and  dismounted on their return from Ion.    A servant rose from the grass, where he had been lying at his ease; came  forward and led away his young mistress's pony, while the lover bade her a  tender good-night, sprang into the saddle again, and presently  disappeared, lost to view amid the trees and the windings of the road,  though the sound of horse's hoofs still came faintly to Elsie's ear as she  stood intently listening, a sweet smile irradiating every feature.    Absorbed in her own thoughts, and in the effort to catch those  fast-retreating sounds, she did not hear a step approaching from behind;  but an arm encircled her waist, and a low-breathed \"My darling\" woke her  from her reverie.    She looked up, her eyes beaming with affection; \"Papa; I am rather late,  am I not?\"    \"Not very. Hark! the clock is but just striking ten. Come, let us sit down  here for a little. We have hardly had a chat together to-day.\" He sighed  slightly as he drew her closer to him.    \"No, papa dear, there has been so much company,\" she answered, laying her  head on his shoulder. \"And----\"    \"And what?\" as she paused. \"Your father used to know all that concerned  you one way or the other. Is he to be shut out from your confidence now?  Ah, I think he must have been for some time past.\"    \"I could not tell you _that_, papa,\" she murmured, blushing visibly in the  moonlight. \"Indeed, I hardly knew it myself till----\"    \"Till when?\"    \"The night of Sophie's wedding.\"    \"Ah!\" he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#2)"],[1," Elsie?\"    \"I should think so! and the boat is ever so pretty. Let's hurry and get  dressed and go down and see it closer.\"    Rowing and sailing upon the bayou and lakelet had been the children's  greatest pleasure at Viamede, their greatest regret in leaving it. Knowing  this, their ever indulgent parents had prepared a pleasant surprise for  them, causing a small tract of barren land on the Ion estate to be turned  into an artificial lake. It was this, shining in the golden beams of the  morning sun, and a beautiful boat moored to the hither shore, that had  called forth from the lips of the little girls those exclamations of  almost incredulous wonder and delight.    \"Yes; I'll ring for Dinah,\" cried Vi, skipping across the room and putting  out her hand to lay hold of the bell pull.    \"Wait, Vi, our prayers first, you know,\" said Elsie.    \"Oh, yes! I do want to thank God for being so good to us; the pretty lake  and boat and all.\"    \"Dear kind parents, safe journey home, too, and oh more things than we can  count,\" added Elsie, as they knelt down side by side.    This duty performed with no irreverent haste, the maid was summoned and a  careful toilet made in season to afford them time for a walk before mamma  would be ready to see them.    They found their father in the lower veranda talking with the overseer,  while Solon stood waiting with Beppo's bridle in his hand, the horse  pawing the ground with impatience.    Eddie was there, too, caressing Bruno who seemed as glad to be at home  again as any of the rest. Uttering a joyous bark he left his young master  and bounded to meet the little girls.    Mr. Travilla turned at the sound and with a kind fatherly smile, held out  his hands.    \"O papa,\" they cried running to him, \"how good of you to have it made for  us!\"    \"Good-morning, my darlings,\" he said, giving and receiving caresses, \"but  what are you talking about?\"    \"Why the lake, papa; the lake and the boat.\"    \"Lake?\" exclaimed Eddie, \"why where?\"    \"Oh, you couldn't see it from your windows,\" said Elsie. \"Papa, papa, may  we go now and look at it?\"    \"Yes,\" he said, taking a hand of each. \"Larkin, I'll see you again after  breakfast. Come, Eddie, my son, you too, and Bruno.\"    A brisk five minutes' walk brought them to the shore of the lake, a tiny  one, scarce a quarter of a mile in circumference, not very deep and the  water so clear that the pebbly bottom could be distinctly seen; gold and  silver fish, too, gliding hither and thither; while a pretty, gayly  painted row-boat lying at the water's edge, rocked gently in the morning  breeze.    Eddie hailed the scene with a shout of delight; the little girls danced  about gleefully, Vi clapping her hands and asking eagerly if they might  get into the boat.    Papa looked at his watch, \"Yes, there will be time for a row; one trip  around the lake. Step in, all of you, and I will take the oars.\"    Vi was quite ready and Eddie gallantly handed her in, then turned and  offered his hand to Elsie. She demurred. \"But mamma! shouldn't we have  mamma with us the first time?\" and she looked up inquiringly into her  father's face.    \"Yes, yes, of course!\" cried the others making haste to step ashore again,  \"we want dear mamma with us the very first time.\"    Papa smiled approval. \"Then we will go back,\" he said, \"and after  breakfast, if mamma is willing, we will all come and take a row together;  the boat is large enough to carry us all at once.\"    Mamma's consent was readily obtained, for to please her children was her  great delight. So shortly after breakfast they all repaired to the lake  and rowed round and across it several times, a merry, happy party.    At Roselands the family were gathered about the breakfast table and the  principal topic of conversation was the return of the party from Viamede.  Calhoun had been to the Oaks the previous evening and learned of their  safe arrival.    \"We must all go this morning and call upon them,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.    \"We'll divide our forces,\" said Cal, laughing. \"Suppose grandpa, mother  and Aunt Enna, go first to the Oaks; and we younger ones to Ion?\"    \"Very well,\" replied the old gentleman, \"I shall spend an hour with my  son, then ride over to see Elsie and her little flock. How many of you  young folks want to go to Ion in the first division?\"    \"I!\" \"And I!\" \"And I!\" cried one and another.    \"But you can't go all at once,\" returned their grandfather, looking  around upon them with an amused smile; \"the carriage is roomy, but really  you are too many for it. Besides wouldn't there be some danger of  overwhelming your cousins?\"    \"Well, I'm going, let who will stay at home,\" observed Molly Percival with  cool decision. \"The boys can ride, I mean Cal, and Art, and Dick and Wal;  they all have ponies and the two carriages will hold the rest of us if we  crowd a little.\"    \"I'm not going to be bothered with Bob or Betty,\" said her mother; \"they  may go with you, or wait till another time.\"    \"Then they'll wait,\" remarked Isadore Conly, \"for I shall wear my best  silk suit, and I have no notion of having it tumbled.\"    \"Last year's suit is quite good enough for the occasion,\" said her mother,  \"they're only cousins.\"    \"But rich ones, that can afford to dress, and I'll not go a step if I have  to look shabby.\"    \"Nor I,\" chimed in her sister. \"So mamma you may as well resign yourself  to the situation. It's no good finding fault or objecting,\" she added with  a laugh.    \"Take your own way, then,\" returned her mother indifferently, \"but  remember there'll be no more new dresses this season.\"    \"Dear me, why aren't we as rich as the Travillas?\" pouted Isadore. \"I do  think things are very unequally divided in this world.\"    \"Never mind; the wheel of fortune often takes a turn,\" said her mother.  \"You may have money left you some day (some of your father's relations are  still rich), and you may make a grand match.\"    \"How long will it take you girls to don your finery?\" ask Cal, pulling out  his watch. \"We'd better start as soon as we can: the sun will be getting  hot.\"    \"I'm done,\" said Molly, jumping up, \"and I'll be ready by the time the  carriage can be brought to the door. Come Isa and Virgy, you've eaten  enough. Cousin Elsie will be sure to treat us to something good.\" And she  ran gayly from the room.    Molly, just turned thirteen, and already as tall as her mother, was a  bright, lively girl, full of fun and frolic. She was not a beauty, but had  a clear complexion and fine dark eyes, and good humor and intelligence  lent a charm to her face that made it more than ordinarily attractive.    Dick had always been fond of her, and was beginning to take a brotherly  pride in her good looks and intellectual gifts.    Enna's feelings toward her were divided between motherly pride and  affection on the one hand, and on the other the dread of being made to  appear old by the side of so tall a daughter; a dread that made her  jealous of Dick also.    The Conly girls, too, were growing fast, giving promise of fair, graceful  womanhood, Isadore particularly of great beauty; which her mother fondly  hoped would be the means of securing her a wealthy husband; for Mrs.  Conly's affections were wholly set upon the things of this life; by her  and her sister Enna, wealth and beauty were esteemed the highest good, and  their children were trained in accordance with that view; the moral  atmosphere of the house being very different from that of Ion, where the  lives and conversation of the parents were such as to leave no doubt in  the minds of their children, that to them the things of time and sense  were as nothing in comparison with those of eternity.    Enna followed her daughter into the dressing-room they used in common.    \"Wear the very best you have, Molly,\" she said, \"I don't want you to be  looked down upon as a poor relation, or to have it said that the Conlys  dress better than my children.\"    \"I'm sure they don't,\" said Molly, ringing for the maid, \"though they'd  like to if they could, and are always jealous when grandpa makes me a  present.\"    \"Of course they are, and they manage to get more than their fair share,  too,\" acquiesced the mother in a tone of irritation; \"but do you see to it  that they don't get ahead of you at Ion; remember Elsie is as rich as a  Jew, and likes the credit of being generous, so keep on the right side of  her, if you want handsome presents.\"    \"I'm sure she is generous and doesn't give only for the credit of it,\"  said Molly.    \"Don't give me any impudence,\" returned her mother sharply. \"Rachel,\" to  the maid who just then came in in answer to the bell, \"dress Miss Molly  first, and be quick about it.\"    Enna superintended the business in person, and in a way that sorely tried  the temper and nerves of both Molly and the maid; the child's sash must be  tied and retied, her hat bent this way and that, her collar and brooch  changed again and again, till she was ready to cry with impatience; and  when at last she started for the door, she was called back, and Rachel  ordered to change her slippers for gaiter boots.    \"I don't want to wear them!\" cried Molly, fairly stamping with impatience.  \"The heels are so high and narrow, I can't bear them.\"    \"They're just the style and make your foot look beautiful,\" said her  mother, \"sit down and let Rachel put them on you.\"    \"Grandpa says they're dangerous, and so does Dr. Barton, too,\" grumbled  Molly.    \"Put them on her, Rachel,\" commanded Enna. \"Molly, behave yourself, or  you'll stay at home.\"    The child submitted rather sullenly, muttering that she would be late.    Rachel was fastening the second boot, when Isadore and Virginia were heard  running down the stairs, calling out that the carriage was at the door.    \"There! I knew you'd make me too late!\" cried Molly. \"Oh, Rachel, do  hurry!\"    \"Yes, Miss Molly, best I kin; dar dat's de las' button.\"    Up sprang Molly, and away in"]]]
