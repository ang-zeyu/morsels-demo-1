There was a tower at one end, partly fell to pieces but  yet enough left to easy tell what it was. I could see it had kinda  loop-holes in it. There was an open place where I took it the main  entrance had used to be; what I'd call the official entrance. But  there was other entrances besides, and some of 'em was made by time  and hard weather. There was what looked like awhat-you-may-call-'em--  a ditch thing, yuh mind, running around my side of it, and a bridge  business. Uh course, it was all needing repairs bad, and part of it  yuh needed to use your imagination on. I laid there for quite a spell  looking it over and wondering how the dickens it come to be way down  there. It didn't look to me like it ought to be there at all, but in a  school geography or a history where the chapter is on historic and  prehistoric hangouts uh the heathen.\"    \"The deuce! A castle in the Bad-lands!\" ejaculated Branciforte.    \"That's what it was, all right. I found a trail it would make a  mountain sheep seasick to follow, and I got down into the coulee. It  was lonesome as sin, and spooky; but there was a spring close by, and  a creek running from it; and what is a treat in that part uh the  country, it was good drinking and didn't have neither alkali nor  sulphur nor mineral in it. It was just straight water, and you can  gamble I filled up on it a-plenty. Then I shot a rabbit or two that  was hanging out around the ruins, and camped there till next day, when  I found a pass out, and got my bearings by the river and come on into  camp. So when you throw slurs on our plumb newness and shininess, I've  got the cards to call yuh. That castle wasn't built last summer,  Mister. And whoever did build it was some civilized. So there yuh  are.\"    Andy took a last, lingering pull at the cigarette stub, flung it into  the backened forge, and picked up the spur. He settled his hat on his  head at its accustomed don't-give-a-darn tilt, and started for the  door and the sunlight.    \"Oh, but say! didn't you find out anything about it afterwards? There  must have been something--\"    \"If it's relics uh the dim and musty past yuh mean, there was; relics  to burn. I kicked up specimens of ancient dishes, and truck like that,  while I was prowling around for fire-wood. And inside the castle, in  what I reckon was used for the main hall, I run acrost a skeleton.  That is, part of one. I don't believe it was all there, though.\"    \"But, man alive, why haven't you made use of a discovery like that?\"  Branciforte followed him out, lighting his pipe with fingers that  trembled. \"Don't you realize what a thing like that means?\"    Andy turned and smiled lazily down at him. \"At the time I was there, I  was all took up with the idea uh getting home. I couldn't eat  skeletons, Mister, nor yet the remains uh prehistoric dishes. And I  didn't run acrost no money, nor no plan marked up with crosses where  you're supposed to do your excavating for treasure. It wasn't nothing,  that I could see, for a man to starve to death while he examined it  thorough. And so far as I know there ain't any record of it. I never  heard no one mention building it, anyhow.\" He stooped and adjusted the  spur to his heel to see if it were quite right, and went off to the  stable humming under his breath.    Branciforte stood at the door of the blacksmith shop and gazed after  him, puffing meditatively at his pipe. \"Lord! the ignorance of these  Western folk! To run upon a find like that, and to think it less  important than getting home in time for supper. To let a discovery  like that lie forgotten, a mere incident in a day's travel! That  fellow thinks more, right now, about his horse going lame and himself  raising blisters on his heels, than of--Jove, what ignorance! He--he  couldn't _eat_ the skeleton or the dishes! Jerusalem!\" Branciforte  knocked his pipe gently against the door-casing, put in into his coat  pocket and hurried to the house to hunt up the others and tell them  what he had heard.    That night the roundup pulled in to the home ranch.    The visitors, headed by their host, swooped down upon the roundup  wagons just when the boys were gathered together for a cigarette or  two apiece and a little talk before rolling in. There was no  night-guarding to do, and trouble winged afar. Sherwood Branciforte  hunted out Andy Green where he lay at ease with head and shoulders  propped against a wheel of the bed-wagon and gossipped with Pink and a  few others.    \"Look here, Green,\" he said in a voice to arrest the attention of the  whole camp, \"I wish you'd tell the others that tale you told me this  afternoon--about that ruined castle down in the hills. Mason, here, is  a newspaper man; he scents a story for his paper. And the rest refuse  to believe a word I say.\"    \"I'd hate to have a rep like that, Mr. Branciforte,\" Andy said  commiseratingly, and turned his big, honest gray eyes to where stood  the women--two breezy young persons with sleeves rolled to tanned  elbows and cowboy hats of the musical comedy brand. Also they had gay  silk handkerchiefs knotted picturesquely around their throats. There  was another, a giggly, gurgly lady with gray hair fluffed up into a  pompadour. You know the sort. She was the kind who refuses to grow  old, and so merely grows imbecile.    \"Do tell us, Mr. Green,\" this young old lady urged, displaying much  gold by her smile. \"It sounds so romantic.\"    \"It's funny you never mentioned it to any of us,\" put in the \"old man\"  suspiciously.    Andy pulled himself up into a more decorous position, and turned his  eyes towards his boss. \"I never knew yuh took any interest in  relic-hunting,\" he explained mildly.    \"Sherwood says you found a _skeleton!_\" said the young old lady,  shuddering pleasurably.    \"Yes, I did find one--or part of one,\" Andy admitted reluctantly.    \"What were the relics of pottery like?\" demanded one of the  cowboy-hatted girls, as if she meant to test him. \"I do some  collecting of that sort of thing.\"    Andy threw away his cigarette, and with it all compunction. \"Well, I  wasn't so much interested in the dishes as in getting something to  eat,\" he apologized. \"I saw several different kinds. One was a big,  awkward looking thing and was pretty heavy, and had straight sides.  Then I come across one or two more that was ornamented some. One had  what looked like a fish on it, and the other I couldn't make out very  well. They didn't look to be worth much, none of 'em.\"    \"Green,\" said his employer steadily, \"_was_ there such a place?\"    Andy returned his look honestly. \"There was, and there is yet, I  guess,\" he asserted. \"I'll tell you how you can find it and what it's  like--if yuh doubt my words.\" He glanced around and found every man,  including the cook, listening intently. He picked a blade of new grass  and began splitting it into tiny threads. The host found boxes for the  women to sit upon, and the men sat down upon the grass.    \"Before I come here to work, I was riding for the Circle C. One day I  was riding away down in the Bad-lands alone and my horse slipped in  some shale rock and went lame; strained his shoulder so I couldn't  ride him. That put me afoot, and climbing up and down them hills I  lost my bearings and didn't know where I was at for a day or two. I  wandered around aimless, and got into a strip uh country that was new  to me and plumb lonesome and wild.    \"That second day is when I happened across this ruin. I was looking  down into a deep, shut-in coulee, hunting water, when the sun come out  and shone straight on to this place. It was right down under me; a  stone ruin, with a tower on one end and kinda tumbled down so it  wasn't so awful high--the tower wasn't. There was a--a--\"    \"Moat,\" Branciforte suggested.    \"That's the word--a moat around it, and a bridge that was just about  gone to pieces. It had loopholes, like the pictures of castles, and  a--\"    \"Battlement?\" ventured one of the musical-comedy cowgirls.    Andy had not meant to say battlement; of a truth, his conception of  battlements was extremely hazy, but he caught up the word and warmed  to the subject. \"Battlement? well I should guess yes! There was about  as elegant a battlement as I'd want to see anywhere. It was sure a  peach. It was--\" he hesitated for a fraction of a second. \"It was high  as the tower, and it had figures carved all over it; them kind that  looks like kid-drawing in school, with bows and arrows stuck out in  front of 'em, threatening.\"    \"Not the old Greek!\" exclaimed one of the girls in a little,  breathless voice.    \"I couldn't say as to that,\" Andy made guarded reply. \"I never made no  special study of them things. But they was sure old. And--\"    \"About how large was the castle?\" put in the man who wrote things.  \"How many rooms, say?\"    \"I'd hate to give a guess at the size. I didn't step it off, and I'm a  punk guesser. The rooms I didn't count. I only explored around in the  main hall, like, a little. But it got dark early, down in there, and I  didn't have no matches to waste. And next morning I started right out  at sun-up to find the way home. No, I never counted the rooms, and if  I had, the chances are I'd have likely counted the same one more'n  once; to count them rooms would take an expert, which I ain't--not at  counting. I don't reckon, though, that there was so awful many.  Anyway, not more than fifteen or twenty. But as I say, I couldn't  rightly make a guess, even; or I'd hate to. Ruins don't interest me  much, though I was kinda surprised to run acrost that one, all right,  and I'm willing to gamble there was warm and exciting times down there  when the place was in running order. I'd kinda like to have been down  there then. Last fall, though, there wasn't nothing to get excited  over, except getting out uh there.\"    \"A castle away out here!

The story of Jewish literature, after the destruction of the Temple at  Jerusalem in the year 70 of the Christian era, centres round the city of  Jamnia. Jamnia, or Jabneh, lay near the sea, beautifully situated on the  slopes of a gentle hill in the lowlands, about twenty-eight miles from  the capital. When Vespasian was advancing to the siege of Jerusalem, he  occupied Jamnia, and thither the Jewish Synhedrion, or Great Council,  transferred itself when Jerusalem fell. A college existed there  already, but Jamnia then became the head-quarters of Jewish learning,  and retained that position till the year 135. At that date the learned  circle moved further north, to Galilee, and, besides the famous school  at Lydda in Judea, others were founded in Tiberias, Usha, and Sepphoris.    The real founder of the College at Jamnia was Jochanan, the son of  Zakkai, called \"the father of wisdom.\" Like the Greek philosophers who  taught their pupils in the gardens of the \"Academy\" at Athens, the  Rabbis may have lectured to their students in a \"Vineyard\" at Jamnia.  Possibly the term \"Vineyard\" was only a metaphor applied to the  meeting-place of the Wise at Jamnia, but, at all events, the result of  these pleasant intellectual gatherings was the Rabbinical literature.  Jochanan himself was a typical Rabbi. For a great part of his life he  followed a mercantile pursuit, and earned his bread by manual labor. His  originality as a teacher lay in his perception that Judaism could  survive the loss of its national centre. He felt that \"charity and the  love of men may replace the sacrifices.\" He would have preferred his  brethren to submit to Rome, and his political foresight was justified  when the war of independence closed in disaster. As Graetz has well  said, like Jeremiah Jochanan wept over the desolation of Zion, but like  Zerubbabel he created a new sanctuary. Jochanan's new sanctuary was the  school.    In the \"Vineyard\" at Jamnia, the Jewish tradition was the subject of  much animated inquiry. The religious, ethical, and practical literature  of the past was sifted and treasured, and fresh additions were made. But  not much was written, for until the close of the second century the new  literature of the Jews was _oral_. The Bible was written down, and read  from scrolls, but the Rabbinical literature was committed to memory  piecemeal, and handed down from teacher to pupil. Notes were perhaps  taken in writing, but even when the Oral Literature was collected, and  arranged as a book, it is believed by many authorities that the book so  compiled remained for a considerable period an oral and not a written  book.    This book was called the _Mishnah_ (from the verb _shana_, \"to repeat\"  or \"to learn\"). The Mishnah was not the work of one man or of one age.  So long was it in growing, that its birth dates from long before the  destruction of the Temple. But the men most closely associated with the  compilation of the Mishnah were the Tannaim (from the root _tana_, which  has the same meaning as _shana_). There were about one hundred and  twenty of these Tannaim between the years 70 and 200 C.E., and they may  be conveniently arranged in four generations. From each generation one  typical representative will here be selected.        THE TANNAIM        First Generation, 70 to 100 C.E.      JOCHANAN, the son of Zakkai        Second Generation, 100 to 130 C.E.      AKIBA        Third Generation, 130 to 160 C.E.      MEIR        Fourth Generation, 160 to 200 C.E.      JUDAH THE PRINCE    The Tannaim were the possessors of what was perhaps the greatest  principle that dominated a literature until the close of the eighteenth  century. They maintained that _literature_ and _life_ were co-extensive.  It was said of Jochanan, the son of Zakkai, that he never walked a  single step without thinking of God. Learning the Torah, that is, the  Law, the authorized Word of God, and its Prophetical and Rabbinical  developments, was man's supreme duty. \"If thou hast learned much Torah,  ascribe not any merit to thyself, for therefor wast thou created.\" Man  was created to learn; literature was the aim of life. We have already  seen what kind of literature. Jochanan once said to his five favorite  disciples: \"Go forth and consider which is the good way to which a man  should cleave.\" He received various answers, but he most approved of  this response: \"A good heart is the way.\" Literature is life if it be a  heart-literature--this may be regarded as the final justification of the  union effected in the Mishnah between learning and righteousness.    Akiba, who may be taken to represent the second generation of Tannaim,  differed in character from Jochanan. Jochanan had been a member of the  peace party in the years 66 to 70; Akiba was a patriot, and took a  personal part in the later struggle against Rome, which was organized by  the heroic Bar Cochba in the years 131 to 135. Akiba set his face  against frivolity, and pronounced silence a fence about wisdom. But his  disposition was resolute rather than severe. Of him the most romantic of  love stories is told. He was a herdsman, and fell in love with his  master's daughter, who endured poverty as his devoted wife, and was  glorified in her husband's fame. But whatever contrast there may have  been in the two characters, Akiba, like Jochanan, believed that a  literature was worthless unless it expressed itself in the life of the  scholar. He and his school held in low esteem the man who, though  learned, led an evil life, but they took as their ideal the"]]]
