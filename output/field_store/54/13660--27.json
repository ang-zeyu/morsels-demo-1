Under  the microscope it is perfectly amorphous. In the air it deliquesces much  more rapidly than ignited calcium chloride.    Treated with dilute mineral acids or oxalic acid on the water-bath  gallisin is transformed into dextrose. It does not ferment when treated in  water solution with fresh yeast. The analyses led to the formula  C_{12}H_{24}O_{10}. When treated under pressure with three times its  weight of acetic anhydride at 130-140 deg. it dissolves perfectly. From the  solution a product was separated which on analysis gave results agreeing  with the formula C_{12}H_{18}O_{10}(C_{2}H_{3}O)_{6}. The substance  appears therefore to be hexacetylgallisin.    Physiological experiments on lower animals and human beings demonstrated  clearly that gallisin has neither directly nor indirectly any injurious  effect on the health.--_Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft,  17, 1000; Amer.

Under the title of \"Figures Worth Studying,\" Mr. William Farmer, of New  York, read a paper before a recent meeting of the Society of Gas Lighting,  from which the _American Gas Light Journal_ gives the following:    I have prepared the following table, which contains some of the elements  and compounds, with their combining weights, volumes, and specific  gravities. When the combining weight of any of these elements and  compounds is taken in pounds, then the gas or vapor therefrom will always  occupy about 377.07 cubic feet of space, at 60 deg. Fahr. and 30 inches  barometer. If we divide this constant 377.07 by the combining weight of  any of the substances, then the quotient will be the number of cubic feet  per pound of the same. If we divide the combining weight of any of the  substances given in the table by 2, then the quotient will give the  density of the same, as compared with hydrogen. If we divide the combining  weight of any of the substances by the constant 28.87, then the quotient  will be the specific gravity of the gas or vapor therefrom, as compared  with air. All the calculations are based on the atomic weights which are  now generally adopted by the majority of chemists.    -------------------------------------------------------------------                                |        |        |Cub.

The poisonous effects of wall-paper stained with emerald-green  (aceto-arsenite of copper) appears to be a very favorite topic in many  journals; it is continually reappearing in one form or another in  different publications, especially medical ones; there has recently  appeared a short reference to it under the title, \"The Poisonous Effect of  Wall-paper.\" As some years ago I became practically acquainted with its  properties and manufacture, a few observations on these subjects may not  be without interest.    In the paragraph referred to, it is stated that the poisonous effect of  this pigment cannot be _entirely_ due to its mere mechanical detachment  from the paper. This writer therefore attributes the poisonous effects to  the formation of the hydrogen compound of arsenic, viz., arseniureted  hydrogen (AsH_{3}); the hydrogen, for the formation of this compound,  being generated, the writer thinks probable, \"by the joint action of  moisture and organic matters, viz., of substances used in fixing to walls  papers impregnated with arsenic.\" In some of our chemical manuals, Dr.  Kolbe's \"Inorganic Chemistry,\" for example, it is also stated that  arseniureted hydrogen is formed by the _fermentation_ of the starch-paste  employed for fastening the paper to the walls. It is perfectly obvious  that the fermentation of the starch-paste must cease after a time, and  therefore the poisonous effects of the paper must likewise cease if its  injurious effects are caused by the fermentation. I do not think that  arseniureted hydrogen could be formed under the _conditions_, for the  oxygen compound of arsenic is in a state of combination, and the compound  is in a dry solid state and not in solution and the affinities of the two  elements--arsenic and hydrogen--for each other are so exceedingly weak  that they cannot be made to unite directly except they are both set free  at the same moment in presence of each other. Further, for the formation  of this hydrogen compound by the fermentation of the starch, or by the  growth of minute fungi, the _entire_ compound must be broken up, and  therefore the pigment would become discolored; but aceto-arsenite of  copper        (3CuAs_{2}O_{4}+Cu(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2})    is a very stable compound, not readily undergoing decomposition, and is  consequently a very permanent color. It has also been not unfrequently  stated that the injurious effects of this pigment are due to the arsenious  oxide volatilizing from the other constituents of the compound. This  volatilization would likewise cause a breaking up of the entire compound,  and would consequently cause a discoloration of the paper; but the  volatilization of this arsenic compound is in every respect most  improbable.    The injurious effects, if any, of this pigment must therefore be due to  its mechanical detachment from the paper; but has it ever been  conclusively proved that persons who inhabit rooms the wall-paper of which  is stained with emerald-green suffer from arsenical poisoning? If it does  occur, then the effects of what may be termed homoeopathic doses of this  substance are totally different from the effects which arise from larger  doses. During the packing of this substance in its dry state in the  factory, clouds of its dust ascend in the air, and during the time I had  to do with its manufacture I never heard that any of the factory hands  suffered, nor did I suffer, from arsenical poisoning. If there is any  abrasion of the skin the dust produces a sore, and also the delicate  lining of the nostrils is apt to be affected. It is in this way it acts in  large doses; I am therefore very skeptical as to its supposed poisonous  effects when wall-paper is stained with it.    Different methods are given in works on chemistry for the manufacture of  this pigment, but as they do not agree in every respect with the method  which was followed in English color factories some years ago, it will be  as well, for the full elucidation of the manufacture of this substance, to  briefly recite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14"],[0,"The 1990 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1,"of the Soviet Union), Cambodia, Cuba, Iran, Vietnam, People's  Democratic Republic of Yemen {Yemen (Aden) or South Yemen}, Ukraine  (constituent republic of the Soviet Union) and, obviously, the US itself.  In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 13 nations that are not  in the UN--Andorra, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,  Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, South Korea,  Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Vatican City. North Korea is not in  the UN and the US does not have diplomatic relations with that nation.  The US has not recognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania into the Soviet Union and continues to accredit the diplomatic  representatives of their last free governments.    Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations  that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral  claims of one sort or another. Every international land boundary  dispute in the \"Guide to International Boundaries,\" a map published  by the Department of State, is included. References to other situations  may also be included that are border- or frontier-relevant, such as  maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.  However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance  or recognition by the US Government.    Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. Nation refers to a people politically organized into a  sovereign state with a definite territory. Dependent area refers to a  broad category of political entities that are associated in some way  with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form  names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The  long-form name is included in the Government section and an entry  of \"none\" indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some  instances, no short-form name exists--then the long-form name must  serve for all usages.

Those Baltic states are not members of the  UN and are not included in the list of nations. The US Government does  not recognize the four so-called \"independent\" homelands of  Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.    Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and  services produced domestically.    Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and  services produced domestically, plus income earned abroad, minus  income earned by foreigners from domestic production.    GNP/GDP methodology: GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the OECD  countries, the USSR, Eastern Europe, and a portion of the developing  countries, are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)  calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange  rates. The PPP methods involve the use of average price weights,  which lie between the weights of the domestic and foreign price systems;  using these weights, US $100 converted into German marks by a PPP  method will buy an equal amount of goods and services in both the US  and Germany. One caution: the proportion of, say, military expenditures  as a percent of GNP/GDP in local currency accounts may differ  substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP is expressed in PPP dollar  terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates the dollar level of  Soviet or Japanese military expenditures. Similarly, dollar figures for  exports and imports reflect the price patterns of international  markets rather than PPP price patterns.    Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the  population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over  deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country.  The rate may be positive or negative.    Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit  drugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens,  and cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside medical channels.      Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,  Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol),  hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).      Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush and the leaves contain the stimulant  cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa which comes from cacao  seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.      Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.      Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).      Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.      Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.      Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA,  STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues  (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).      Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).      Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.      Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).      Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to  opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics  include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and  thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and  hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or  Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and  others (Darvon, Lomotil).      Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the  opium poppy.      Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.      Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried  opium poppy.      Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.      Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and  activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,  Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and  others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).    Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one  year of age in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same  year.    Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as  arable land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after  each harvest (wheat, maize, rice); permanent crops--land  cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest  (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently  used for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--land under  dense or open stands of trees; and other--any land type not  specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert).
