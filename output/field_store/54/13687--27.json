Now,  although this is a question really of more interest to lawyers, than to  the public in general, and one which might, therefore, be left to their  decision, yet there was an _animus_ at the time among this class of men,  that rendered them not disinterested judges. Their opinion therefore must  be taken with a qualification, as well on the score of particular  immediate drawbacks, as on the score of their general professional  prejudices. Lord Brougham respected too much the principles of justice,  and he too little regarded the technicalities of law, to be agreeable to  that body. He had a faculty too, for giving speedy judgments, and a  determination to prevent unnecessary expenses, that were particularly  disagreeable to men imbued with a conscientious desire that justice  should not be prejudiced by an unprecedented and informal haste in its  dispensation, or by a reduction of the number of its advocates. The new  Lord Chancellor, too, thought that when one or two intelligent barristers  had been engaged at a large expense, and had well stated the case of  their client, it was quite unnecessary that the same ground should be  again gone over by juniors, whose arguments marred more than they helped  the interests of their employers. When, therefore, he either put them  down, or was droned into a short nap, while the industrious advocate was  earning his unnecessary fee, it was a specimen of \"the arrogance of an  upstart wholly unacquainted with Chancery Law,\" or \"of an eccentricity  bordering on insanity, and wholly unfitting its exhibitor for the high  and responsible situation he held.\" Posterity will do justice to Lord  Brougham in this respect. It will be felt to have been impossible that a  man of such vast acquirements, who had been so successful in his  profession, and who had, in all other branches of knowledge, evinced such  clearness of intellect, could have been the inefficient lawyer his  detractors have represented him to be.    There is another great department in which he has proved his  excellence--that of physical science. With the principles of all the  sciences, his works show him to be familiar. His treatise \"on the  Objects, Pleasures, and Advantages of Science\" is admirable, as a  bird's-eye view of the subject, while at the same time it is an enticing  stimulant to study. The work on \"Natural Theology\" necessarily touches  upon the physical sciences, and their connection with the great mechanism  of nature. The geometrical and optical papers, published in the  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, when he was only fifteen  years of age, show at least a firm groundwork of scientific knowledge.  And if it be said that Lord Brougham's attainments are superficial only,  we say that knowledge of detail does not of itself make a man competent.  The _principles_ of all sciences are a _sine qua non_.    Lord Brougham is eminently clear-headed; and he is distinguished for his  argumentative powers. He has peculiarly the faculty of analysis; that of  keeping in his own mind a comprehensive view of the whole bearings of a  question, even while running at large into the minutest details; no man  detects the fallacy  of an opponent's argument more easily; nor can any  man be more skillful in concocting a fallacy to suit a temporary purpose.    Lord Brougham's eloquence most distinguishes him from his contemporaries.  Learning may be acquired; the habit of reasoning may be induced by  constant dialectic contest; but eloquence is far more than these the gift  of nature. Lord Brougham's eloquence savors of the peculiar constitution  of his mind. It is eminently adapted for educated men. He was never  intended for a demagogue; for he never condescends to the art of  pandering to the populace. His speeches are specimens of argumentative  eloquence; and their only defect arises from his fertility of  illustration. The extraordinary information he possesses has induced the  habit of drawing too largely upon it; and he is apt to be led aside from  the straight road of his argument, to elucidate some minor disputed  point. But the argumentative style of which we speak is almost peculiar  to himself. There is a ripeness, a fruitfulness, in his mind, that places  him above the fetters of ordinary speakers. Such men, from the difficulty  of clearing their heads for the contest, too often present a mere  fleshless skeleton, as it were, very convincing to the judgment, but  powerless over the feelings; so that no lasting impression is produced.  But Lord Brougham, from being a master in argument, is free to pursue his  bent in illustration, and thus conjures up a whole picture that dwells on  the mind, and is remembered for its effect on the feelings or the  imagination, even by men whose levity or dullness precluded their being  fixed by the argument. The very structure of his sentences is more  adapted for this kind of speaking than any other. They sometimes appear  involved, to an ordinary mind, from their length, and the abundance of  illustration and explanation which they embrace; but the extraordinary  vigor with which the delivery is kept up, and the liveliness of fancy or  of humor that flashes at every turn of the thought, soon dispel the  temporary cloud.    In irony and in sarcasm, Lord Brougham is unrivaled among the public men  of the day. That his exuberant power of ridicule led him while Lord  Chancellor, into some excess of its use, cannot be denied, although a  ready excuse can be found in the circumstances of his situation. He might  be held to be the representative of liberal principles in a place where  almost the name of Liberal had, till then, been proscribed; and the  animosity toward  the new Chancellor, evinced by many peers, was  calculated to induce reprisals. The eccentricities, too, of men of genius  are of such value that they may well be said to atone for themselves.    A quality of Lord Brougham's mind, that is almost as extraordinary as his  extent of information, is its singular activity. His energies never seem  to flag--even for an instant; he does not seem to know what it is to be  fatigued, or jaded. Some such quality as this, indeed, the vastness and  universality of his acquirements called for, in order to make the weight  endurable to himself, and to bear him up during his long career of  political excitement. Take the routine of a day for instance. In his  early life he has been known to attend, in his place in court, on  circuit, at an early hour in the morning. After having successfully  pleaded the cause of his client, he drives off to the hustings; and  delivers, at different places, eloquent speeches to the electors. He then  sits in the retirement of his closet to pen an address to the Glasgow  students, perhaps, or an elaborate article in the Edinburgh Review. The  active labors of the day are closed with preparation for the court  business of the following morning; and then instead of retiring to rest,  as ordinary men would, after such exertions, he spends the night in  abstruse study, or in social intercourse. Yet he would be seen as early  as eight next morning, actively engaged in the Court, in defense of some  unfortunate object of government persecution; astonishing the auditory,  and his fellow lawyers no less, with the freshness and power of his  eloquence.    A fair contrast with this history of a day, in early life, would be that  of one at a more advanced period; say in 1832. A watchful observer might  see the Lord Chancellor in the Court over which he presided, from an  early hour in the morning until the afternoon, listening to the arguments  of counsel, and mastering the points of cases with a grasp that enabled  him to give those speedy and unembarrassed judgments that have so injured  him with the profession. If he followed his course, he would see him,  soon after the opening of the House of Lords, addressing their Lordships  on some intricate question of Law, with an acuteness that drew  approbation even from his opponents, or, on some all-engrossing political  topic, casting firebrands into the camp of the enemy, and awakening them  from the complacent repose of conviction to the hot contest with more  active and inquiring intellects. Then, in an hour or so, he might follow  him to the Mechanics' Institution, and hear an able and stimulating  discourse on education, admirably adapted to the peculiar capacity of  his auditors; and, toward ten perhaps, at a Literary and Scientific  Institution in Marylebone, the same Proteus-like intellect might be found  expounding the intricacies of physical science with a never tiring and  elastic power. Yet, during all these multitudinous exertions, time would  be found for the composition of a discourse on Natural Theology,  that bears no marks of haste or excitement of mind, but presents as calm  a face as though it had been the laborious production of a contemplative  philosopher.    It would be a great mistake that would suppose the man who has thus  multiplied the objects of his exertion to be of necessity superficial;  superficial, that is, in the sense of shallowness or ignorance. Ordinary  minds are bound by fetters, no doubt. Custom has rendered the pursuit of  more than one idea all but impossible to them, and the vulgar adage of  \"Jack of all trades, master of none,\" applies to them in full force. But  it must be remembered that a public man like Lord Brougham, who has  chosen his peculiar sphere of action, and who prefers being of general  utility to the scholar-like pursuit of any one branch of science  exclusively, is not bound to present credentials of full and perfect  mastership, such as are required from a professor of a university. His  pursuit of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14445"],[0,"Confidences: Talks With a Young Girl Concerning Herself (#2)"],[1," young birds,  in calling for food, make an entirely different sound, and the answer  of the mother bird is a sweet lullaby. One of the ways birds express  themselves in sign language is by their feathers. If they are sick,  their feathers droop. When they are well and happy, their feathers  seem much brighter.    In the bird family, as in the flower family, each member has a special  work to do. The mother bird and the father bird work together to build  the nest, but while the mother bird lays the eggs and then must sit on  them for a number of days, the father bird must bring her food and water  and sometimes take his turn watching the nest while the mother goes for  a little exercise. The mother bird's body resembles the plant, too, for  it needs fresh air, food and water. Instead of leaves to take in the air  it has lungs, which not only take in the fresh air but also send out the  impure air. Instead of the little rootlets to take in the food and water  from the ground, the bird has a mouth, and as the bird is not fastened  to the ground, but is free to fly or move about, it goes after its food.  Instead of sap, it has blood to carry the food to all parts of the body.    The birds have ovaries just the same as the flowers, and inside each  ovary are a number of little seeds or ovules which by and by will grow  into birdies. It takes quite a while for the ovules to ripen, just as it  took quite a while for the seeds to ripen, and when they are ripe they  must have a nest prepared for them, just as the flowers did. But the  birds are not as helpless as the flowers, and are able to make their own  nests. So when the ovules (which are called eggs when they are ripe) are  ready, the parent birds select a nice place for a home.    The father and mother work very hard until the nest is finished. Often  the mother will line it with some of her own feathers, so that it will  be soft and warm. After the nest is ready the mother bird lays the tiny  eggs in it. Then she must sit on them to keep them warm for many days,  for the eggs, like the seeds, cannot grow unless they are kept good and  warm. If we look at the eggs from day to day we will not be able to see  any change in them, but the change is inside the shell where we cannot  see it. Every day there is an alteration taking place, and the egg  gradually is being transformed into the little bird. After a while, when  the right time comes, the birdie will peck a tiny hole in the shell.  This will keep growing larger and larger until it is large enough for  the birdie to come through, then out it comes!                 *       *       *       *       *      A sweet, new blossom of Humanity,    Fresh fallen from God's own home to flower on earth.      Gerald Massey.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER IV    MOTHER'S BABY      There is another wonderful secret that I have to tell you. I wonder  if you can guess what this is! No, it is not about a flower, nor a  bird--but, yes, you have guessed it right, for it is about a girl  just like you!    Is it not queer how much alike the flowers and birds and little girls  are, after all, even if they do not look at all alike?    You have lungs just the same as the bird, and breathe as it does. You  have two feet, but instead of wings you have arms and hands. You have a  sign language, as the flowers have, and you have a language of sounds  that is even better than the bird language. When you are happy, I can  tell it by the smiles on your face, and sometimes when you are a wee bit  cross, I know it by a tiny frown that mars the beauty of your face. But,  of course, that does not happen very often, because, you know, as we  grow older, our faces do not change their expressions as easily as they  do when we are young. And would it not be dreadful, if when you grew up,  you always had a frown on your face and were not nice looking at all?  You know the frown wrinkles try to stay, and every time we let them come  out they leave a tiny mark.    When the flower took in the fresh air it made green coloring matter, but  when you take in the fresh air it makes red coloring matter. So if you  want to have red cheeks and red lips you must have plenty of fresh air.  I know you get a great deal in the daytime when you are playing, but you  must be sure to get it at night, too, or you will lose all your pretty  color. Be sure that your window is open every night.    You remember, the leaves not only had to breathe but they had to digest  the food for the plant, too, but the bird had a stomach to perform that  work.    In this way you are like the birds, for you have a stomach which takes  care of the food you eat. If you wish to grow strong and well so as  to be able to run and play and also to help your mother with her work,  you must eat plenty of good, nourishing food. You know some food makes  muscles, but other things are not very good for people to eat. Plenty of  bread and milk and cereals, also meat, potatoes and fruit, are very good  things to make girls grow. You must take care of your stomach, too, and  give it time to rest, for it works very hard and might get tired out.  Then what would you do?    You have seen, Violet, that in a great many ways you are like the birds  and flowers, but now I am going to tell you something that perhaps you  did not know. Girls have ovaries just the same as flowers and birds, and  inside each ovary are a great many little ovules that after a while will  ripen as the seeds did, only instead of growing into flowers or birds  they will grow into babies. Is that not lovely, and are you not glad  that perhaps some day you will be able to have a baby all your own? But  of course that will not be for a great many years yet, for you must wait  until you have grown into a strong woman and have a home of your own and  a husband to help take care of the baby.    When the little ovules are ripe there must be a nest prepared for them,  just the same as there was one prepared for the flowers and birds. But  now I shall tell you another wonderful secret. Mothers do not have to  build nests, for they are already prepared for them right inside their  bodies close to their hearts. The nest is called the womb. Although we  do not have to build the nest, we have to take good care of it so it  may grow strong.    This nest and the tiny ovules are growing constantly from the time the  girls are babies, but they grow so very slowly that none of the ovules  are ripe until the girl is about twelve years old. After that one ripens  every month and passes to the nest or womb. At the same time an extra  amount of blood is sent to the womb to provide nourishing material for  the ovule to use in its growth. But the womb, or nest, is not strong  enough yet to hold a healthy baby, so this extra amount of blood with  the ovule is sent out of the body through the vagina, which is a  muscular tube leading from the womb to the external parts (private  parts). We call this flow the menstrual flow. This occurs every month  and each time the womb becomes a little stronger and better able to  hold a growing babe. But the womb is not fully developed until the  rest of the body is matured.    Menstruation is the sign of the possibility of motherhood. Realizing  this fact, one cannot fail to have a high idea of this function. Most  girls, naturally, desire children. Little girls love their doll babies,  and spend much time in caring for them, but as girls grow into womanhood  they desire real babies. A woman who does not desire children has had  her mind perverted by false ideas or fear.                 *       *       *       *       *      Build me straight, O worthy Master!      Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel    That shall laugh at all disaster,      And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!      Longfellow.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER V    THE BABY'S NEST      You remember, Violet, I told you that although mothers do not have to  build nests, yet they have to take good care of them so they will grow  strong.    As the natural desire of every girl is to become a mother some time,  she must begin very early to prepare for it. By exercise, fresh air,  and good, nourishing food, she should make her body grow strong and well.  By studying she will develop her mind so as to be fitted to care for and  to teach her child. Shall I tell you some ways you can make the nest  grow strong?    First, I shall tell you more things about this mother nest. Although  it and the tiny ovules are growing all the time, yet there are greater  changes in them when the girl is from twelve to fourteen years old.  About this time they grow faster than at any other time. As these organs  grow, the pelvis, or the part of the body that contains them, also must  grow to make room for them. So the hips begin to grow broader. Other  parts of the body grow faster at this time, too, and often some parts  grow so much faster than others that they are out of proportion, and the  child becomes clumsy and feels awkward. But that will not last long,  for after a while the parts that are growing slowly will catch up to the  ones that grew fast, and then the body will be graceful again. Have you  ever watched a young puppy? You know how clumsy and awkward it is while  it is growing, but after a while, when it is fully grown, it will be  very graceful.    We know it is not wise to run or play or work hard right after eating a  large meal, for then the stomach is working very hard and needs a great  deal of extra energy, so the other muscles must rest a while, in order  to let it have it.    You remember, I told you, Violet, that every month, or every  twenty-eight days, there was an extra amount of blood carried to the  womb which it had to send out of the body. Of course that requires the  womb to work very hard for a few days, so, in order to help it, we must  be careful not to take any severe exercise at this"]]]
