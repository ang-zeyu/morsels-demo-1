Take _Damask Rose_ budds, pluck them, and dry the leaves in the  shadow, the tops of _Lavender_ flowers, sweet _Margerom_, and _Basill_,  of each a handfull, all dryed and mingled with the _Rose_ leaves, take  also of _Benjamin, Storax, Gallingall_ roots, and _Ireos_ or _Orris_ roots,  twice as much of the Orris as of any of the other, beaten in fine  powder: a peece of cotten wool wetted in _Rose_-water, and put  to it a good quantity of _Musk_ and _Ambergreece_ made into powder,  and sprinkle them with some _Civet_ dissolved in _Rose_-water, lay the  Cotten in double paper, and dry it over a chaffin dish of coales:  Lastly, take halfe a handfull of _Cloves_, and as much _Cinamon_ bruised,  not small beaten, mixe all these together, and put them up in  your Bagge.      _A very good Poultis for any Member swell'd and inflamed,  and not broken, to take away the paine_.    Take three pints of new milk, of stale Manchet crums two handfulls,  or so much as shall make the milk somewhat thick, and thereto  put two handfulls of dryed red _Rose_ leaves, and three ounces of  Oyle of _Roses_, boyle all these together to the thicknesse of a Poultisse,  then let it stand and coole, and while it cooleth rake a spoonfull  of Oyle of _Roses_, and with a warm hand rub the place grieved,  till the Oyle be dryed in, and then lay the Poultisse as warm as you  may endure it, to the part inflamed; doe this morning and evening  for three or four dayes, as you shall see cause.      _To make a sweet Cake, and with it a very sweet water._    Take _Damask Rose_ leaves, _Bay_ leaves, _Lavinder_ tops, sweet _Marjerome_  tops, _Ireos_ powder, _Damask_ powder, and a little _Musk_ first  dissolved in sweet water, put the _Rose_ leaves and hearbs into a Bason,  and sprinkle a quarter of a pint of _Rose_-water among them,  and stirring them all together, cover the Bason close with a dish,  and let them stand so covered, all night, in the morning Distill  them, so shall you have at once an excellent sweet water, and a  very fine sweet Cake to lay among your finest linnen.      _Oyle of Roses._    Take Sallet Oyle and put it into an earthen pot, then take _Rose_  leaves, clip off all the white, and bruise them a little, and put them  into the Oyle, and then stop the top close with past, and set it into  a boyling pot of water, and let it boyle one hour, then let it stand  al one night upon hot embers, the next day take the Oyle, and  straine it from the _Rose_ leaves, into a glasse, and put therein some  fresh _Rose_ leaves, clipt as before, stop it, and set it in the Sun every  day for a fortnight or three weeks.      _Syrupe of Roses._    Take _Damask Roses_, clip off the white of them, and take six  ounces of them to every pint of faire water, first well boyled and  scummed, let them stand so as abovesaid, twelve hours, as you doe  in the Syrupe of _Violets_, wringing out the _Roses_ and putting in new  eight times, then wringing out the last put in onely the juice of  four ounces of _Roses_, so make it up as before, if you will put in  _Rubarb_, take to every two drams, slice it, string it on a thred, hang  it within the pot after the first shifting, and let it infuse within your  _Roses_: Some use to boyle the _Rubarb_ in the Syrupe, but it is dangerous,  the Syrupe purgeth _Choller_ and _Melancholly_.      _A Conserve of Roses._    Take red _Rose_ buds, clip of all the white, bruised, and withered  from them, then weigh them out, and taking to every pound of  _Roses_ three pound of _Sugar_, stamp the _Roses_ by themselves very  small putting a little juice of _Lemmons_ or _Rose_ water to them as  they wax dry, when you see the _Roses_ small enough, put the _Sugar_  to them, and beat them together till they be well mingled,  then put it up in Gally pots or glasses; in like manner are the  Conserverves of Flowers, of _Violets, Cowslips, Marigolds, Sage_, and  _Sea boise_ made.      _To Preserve Roses or any other Flowers._    Take one pound of _Roses_, three pound of _Sugar_, one pint of  _Rose_ water, or more, make your Syrupe first, and let it stand till it  be cold, then take your _Rose_ leaves, having first clipt off all the  white, put them into the cold Syrupe, then cover them, and set  them on a soft fire, that they may but simper for two or three  hours, then while they are hot put them into pots or glasses for  your use.      _How to Preserve Barbaries._    First take the fairest _Barbaries_, and of them the greatest bunches  you can get, and with a needle take out the stones on the one  side of them, then weigh out to every halfe pound of them one  pound of _Sugar_, put them into a Preserving pan, strow the _Sugar_  on them, and let them boyle a quarter of an hour softly, then taking  out the _Barbaries_ let the Syrupe boyle a quarter of an hour more,  then put in the _Barbaries_ againe, and let them boyle a pretty while  with the Syrupe, then take them from the Syrupe, and let them  both stand till they be cold, and so put them up.      _To keep Barbaries to garnish your Meat._    Take the worst of them, and boyle them in faire water, and  straine the liquor from them, and while the liquor is hot put it into  your _Barbaries_, being clean picked, and stop them up, and if they  mould much, wash them throughly in the liquor, then boyle the  liquor againe, and strayne it, and let it coole, then put it to your  _Barbaries_ againe.    [Illustration: A Rose]      _Conserve of Barbaries._    Take your _Barbaries_, pick them clean in faire branches, and  wash them clean, and dry them on a cloath, then take some other  _Barbaries_, and boyle them in _Clarret_ wine till they be very soft,  then straine them, and rub them so well through the strainer, that  you may know the substance of them, and boyle up this matter  thus strained out, till it be very sweet, and somwhat thick, then setting  it by till it be cold, and then put in your branches of _Barbaries_  into gally pots, or glasses, and fill it up with the cold Syrupe,  and so shall you have both Syrupe, and also _Barbaries_, to use at  your pleasure.           *       *       *       *       *          _Of Almonds._      _To make Almond Biscate._    Steepe one pound of _Almonds_ so long in cold water, till they will  blanch, then put them in _Rose_-water, and beat them in so much  _Rose_-water as will keep them from growing to an Oyle, and no  more; take one pound of _Sugar_ beaten very fine, and sifted  through a Searce, take the whites of six Eggs beat to a froth, as  you use to doe for other Bisket, with a spoonfull of fine flower,  set the _Almonds_ and _Sugar_ on a soft Charcoal fire, let them boyle  together till they be very thick, and so let them stand till they be  almost cold, then beat the Eggs and that together, put in a little  _Muske_ for the better tast, if you please, then lay them upon papers,  in what proportion you will, and dry them in an Oven, with  a slack fire.      _To make Almond Milke._    Take a rib of _Mutton_ or _Veale_, or rather a _Chicken_, boyle it in  faire water, put thereto _French Barley_, a _Fennill_ root, a _Parsly_  root, _Violet_ leaves, _Strawberry_ leaves, and _Cinquefoyle_ leaves, and  boyle them all together, till the meat be over boyled, then strayne out  the liquor from the rest, while they are boyling blanch a proportion  of _Almonds_ answerable to the liquor, beat them well in a clean  stone Morter, and then grind them therein with _Rose_ water and  _Sugar_, and when they are well ground put in all your liquor by  little and little, and grind with them till they be all well Compounded,  and then strayne it into a faire glasse, and use it at your  pleasure.      _An approved Medicine for the running of the  Reines._    Make _Almond_ Milke of _Plantine_ water, or else boyle _Plantine_  in the liquor whereof you make your _Almond_ Milk, take a quart of  it, and put thereto three spoonfulls of _Lentive farine_, and three  spoonfulls of _Cinamon_ water, take of this at six in the morning, a  good draught, two hours before dinner another, at four of the  clock in the afternoon, a third, and two hours after supper a  fourth; and twice or thrice between meals, eat a spoonfull of  Conserve of Red _Roses_ at a time.      _Oyle of Almonds_.    Take _Almonds_, blanch them, and put them into a pot, and set  that pot in another pot of water that boyleth, and the steam of  the seething pot will arise and enter into the pot with the _Almonds_,  and that will become Oyle when they are stamped and wringed  through a cloath. Thus they make Oyle of the kernels of _Filberts,  Walnuts,_ &c.      _A Barley Cream to procure sleep, or Almond Milke._    Take a good handfull of French _Barley_, wash it cleane in warme  water, and boyle it in a quart of sayre water to the halfe, then put  our the water from the _Barley_, and put the _Barley_ into a pottell of  new clean water, with a _Parsley,_ and a _Fennell_ root, clean washed,  and picked with _Bourage, Buglos, Violet_ leaves, and _Lettice_, of each  one handfull, boyle them with the _Barley_, till more then halfe be  consumed; then strayne out the liquor, and take of blanched  _Almonds_ a handfull, of the seeds of _Melons, Cucumbers, Citralls_, and  _Gourds_, husked, of each halfe a quarter of an ounce, beat these  seeds, and the _Almonds_ together, in a stone morter, with so much  _Sugar_, and Rose-water as is fit, and strayne them through a cleane  cloath into the liquor, and drink thereof at night going to bed,  and in the night, if this doth not sufficiently provoke sleep, then  make some more of the same liquor, and boyle in the same the  beads, or a little of white _Poppey_.      _An Oyntment to kill the Worms in little Children_.    For stomach Wormes, annoynt the stomach with Oyle of _Wormwood,_  and the belly with Oyle of sweet _Almonds_, for belly Wormes take  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13268"],[0,"Hindu literature : Comprising The Book of good counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The (#2)"],[1,"ends come not by wishing. Wouldst thou? Up, and win it, then!      While the hungry lion slumbers, not a deer comes to his den.\"    Having concluded his reflections, the Raja gave orders to assemble a  meeting of learned men. Then said he--    \"Hear now, O my Pundits! Is there one among you so wise that he will  undertake to give the second birth of Wisdom to these my sons, by  teaching them the Books of Policy; for they have never yet read the  Sacred Writings, and are altogether going in the wrong road; and ye know  that        \"Silly glass, in splendid settings, something of the gold may gain;      And in company of wise ones, fools to wisdom may attain.\"    Then uprose a great Sage, by name Vishnu-Sarman, learned in the  principles of Policy as is the angel of the planet Jupiter himself, and  he said--    \"My Lord King, I will undertake to teach these princes Policy, seeing  they are born of a great house; for--        \"Labors spent on the unworthy, of reward the laborer balk;      Like the parrot, teach the heron twenty times, he will not talk.\"    \"But in this royal family the offspring are royal-minded, and in six  moons I will engage to make your Majesty's sons comprehend Policy.\"    The Raja replied, with condescension:--        \"On the eastern mountains lying, common things shine in the sun,      And by learned minds enlightened, lower minds may show as one.\"    \"And you, worshipful sir, are competent to teach my children the rules  of Policy.\"    So saying, with much graciousness, he gave the Princes into the charge  of Vishnu-Sarman; and that sage, by way of introduction, spake to the  Princes, as they sat at ease on the balcony of the palace, in this  wise:--    \"Hear now, my Princes! for the delectation of your Highnesses, I purpose  to tell the tale of the Crow, the Tortoise, the Deer, and the Mouse.\"    \"Pray, sir,\" said the King's sons, \"let us hear it.\"    Vishnu-Sarman answered--    \"It begins with the Winning of Friends; and this is the first verse of  it:--        \"Sans way or wealth, wise friends their purpose gain--      The Mouse, Crow, Deer, and Tortoise make this plain.\"      [2] The Vedas are the holy books of India. They are four in number: The  Rig-Veda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, and Atharva-Veda.          THE WINNING OF FRIENDS          Sans way or wealth, wise friends their purpose gain--      The Mouse, Crow, Deer, and Tortoise make this plain.\"    \"However was that?\" asked the Princes.    Vishnu-Sarman replied:--    \"On the banks of the Godavery there stood a large silk-cotton-tree, and  thither at night, from all quarters and regions, the birds came to  roost. Now once, when the night was just spent, and his Radiance the  Moon, Lover of the white lotus, was about to retire behind the western  hills, a Crow who perched there, 'Light o' Leap' by name, upon  awakening, saw to his great wonder a fowler approaching--a second God of  Death. The sight set him reflecting, as he flew off uneasily to follow  up the man's movements, and he began to think what mischief this  ill-omened apparition foretold.        \"For a thousand thoughts of sorrow, and a hundred things of dread,      By the wise unheeded, trouble day by day the foolish head.\"    And yet in this life it must be that        \"Of the day's impending dangers, Sickness, Death, and Misery,      One will be; the wise man waking, ponders which that one will be.\"    Presently the fowler fixed a net, scattered grains of rice about, and  withdrew to hide. At this moment \"Speckle-neck,\" King of the Pigeons,  chanced to be passing through the sky with his Court, and caught sight  of the rice-grains. Thereupon the King of the Pigeons asked of his  rice-loving followers, 'How can there possibly be rice-grains lying here  in an unfrequented forest? We will see into it, of course, but We like  not the look of it--love of rice may ruin us, as the Traveller was  ruined.        \"All out of longing for a golden bangle,      The Tiger, in the mud, the man did mangle.\"    \"How did that happen?\" asked the Pigeons.      THE STORY OF THE TIGER AND THE TRAVELLER    \"Thus,\" replied Speckle-neck: \"I was pecking about one day in the Deccan  forest, and saw an old tiger sitting newly bathed on the bank of a pool,  like a Brahman, and with holy kuskus-grass[3] in his paws.    'Ho! ho! ye travellers,' he kept calling out, 'take this golden bangle!'    Presently a covetous fellow passed by and heard him.    'Ah!' thought he, 'this is a bit of luck--but I must not risk my neck  for it either.        \"Good things come not out of bad things; wisely leave a longed-for ill.      Nectar being mixed with poison serves no purpose but to kill.\"    'But all gain is got by risk, so I will see into it at least;' then he  called out, 'Where is thy bangle?'    The Tiger stretched forth his paw and exhibited it.    'Hem!' said the Traveller, 'can I trust such a fierce brute as thou  art?'    'Listen,' replied the Tiger, 'once, in the days of my cub-hood, I know I  was very wicked. I killed cows, Brahmans, and men without number--and I  lost my wife and children for it--and haven't kith or kin left. But  lately I met a virtuous man who counselled me to practise the duty of  almsgiving--and, as thou seest, I am strict at ablutions and alms.  Besides, I am old, and my nails and fangs are gone--so who would  mistrust me? and I have so far conquered selfishness, that I keep the  golden bangle for whoso comes. Thou seemest poor! I will give it thee.  Is it not said,        'Give to poor men, son of Kunti--on the wealthy waste not wealth;      Good are simples for the sick man, good for nought to him in health.'    'Wade over the pool, therefore, and take the bangle,'    Thereupon the covetous Traveller determined to trust him, and waded into  the pool, where he soon found himself plunged in mud, and unable to  move.    'Ho! ho!' says the Tiger, 'art thou stuck in a slough? stay, I will  fetch thee out!'    So saying he approached the wretched man and seized him--who meanwhile  bitterly reflected--        'Be his Scripture-learning wondrous, yet the cheat will be a cheat;      Be her pasture ne'er so bitter, yet the cow's milk will be sweet.'    And on that verse, too--        'Trust not water, trust not weapons; trust not clawed nor horned      things;      Neither give thy soul to women, nor thy life to Sons of Kings.'    And those others--        'Look! the Moon, the silver roamer, from whose splendor darkness flies      With his starry cohorts marching, like a crowned king through the              skies.      All the grandeur, all the glory, vanish in the Dragon's jaw;      What is written on the forehead, that will be, and nothing more,'    Here his meditations were cut short by the Tiger devouring him. \"And  that,\" said Speckle-neck, \"is why we counselled caution.\"    \"Why, yes!\" said a certain pigeon, with some presumption, \"but you've  read the verse--        'Counsel in danger; of it        Unwarned, be nothing begun.      But nobody asks a Prophet        Shall the risk of a dinner be run?'    Hearing that, the Pigeons settled at once; for we know that        \"Avarice begetteth anger; blind desires from her begin;      A right fruitful mother is she of a countless spawn of sin.'    And again,        'Can a golden Deer have being? yet for such the Hero pined:--      When the cloud of danger hovers, then its shadow dims the mind.'    Presently they were caught in the net. Thereat, indeed, they all began  to abuse the pigeon by whose suggestion they had been ensnared. It is  the old tale!        \"Be second and not first!--the share's the same      If all go well. If not, the Head's to blame.\"    And we should remember that        \"Passion will be Slave or Mistress: follow her, she brings to woe;      Lead her, 'tis the way to Fortune. Choose the path that thou wilt go.\"    When King Speckle-neck heard their reproaches, he said, \"No, no! it is  no fault of his.    'When the time of trouble cometh, friends may ofttimes irk us most: For  the calf at milking-hour the mother's leg is tying-post.'    'And in disaster, dismay is a coward's quality; let us rather rely on  fortitude, and devise some remedy. How saith the sage?        \"In good fortune not elated, in ill-fortune not dismayed,      Ever eloquent in council, never in the fight affrayed--      Proudly emulous of honor, steadfastly on wisdom set;      Perfect virtues in the nature of a noble soul are met.      Whoso hath them, gem and glory of the three wide worlds[4] is he;      Happy mother she that bore him, she who nursed him on her knee.\"    \"Let us do this now directly,\" continued the King: \"at one moment and  with one will, rising under the net, let us fly off with it: for indeed        'Small things wax exceeding mighty, being cunningly combined:--      Furious elephants are fastened with a rope of grass-blades twined.'    \"And it is written, you know,        'Let the household hold together, though the house be ne'er so small;      Strip the rice-husk from the rice-grain, and it groweth not at all.'    Having pondered this advice, the Pigeons adopted it; and flew away with  the net. At first the fowler, who was at a distance, hoped to recover  them, but as they passed out of sight with the snare about them he gave  up the pursuit. Perceiving this, the Pigeons said,    \"What is the next thing to be done, O King?\"    \"A friend of mine,\" said Speckle-neck, \"lives near in a beautiful forest  on the Gundaki. Golden-skin is his name--the King of the Mice--he is the  one to cut these bonds.\"    Resolving to have recourse to him, they directed their flight to the  hole of Golden-skin--a prudent monarch, who dreaded danger so much that  he had made himself a palace with a hundred outlets, and lived always in  it. Sitting there he heard the descent of the pigeons, and remained  silent and alarmed.    \"Friend Golden-skin,\" cried the King, \"have you no welcome for us?\"    \"Ah, my friend!\" said the Mouse-king, rushing"]]]
