Volume 13, No. 371, May (#2)"],[1,"    The priory of St. Mary, of St. Mary Spittle, contained at its  dissolution, about the year 1536, no less than 180 beds for the  reception of sick persons and travellers. Richard Tarleton, the famous  comedian, at the Curtain Theatre, it is said, \"kept an ordinary in  Spittle-fields, pleasant fields for the citizens to walk in;\" and the  row called Paternoster Row, as the name implies, was formerly a few  houses, where they sold rosaries, relics, &c. The once celebrated  herbalist and astrologer, Nicholas Culpepper, was another inhabitant of  this spot. He died in 1654, in a house he had some time occupied, very  pleasantly situated in the fields; but now a public house at the corner  of Red Lion Court, Red Lion Street, east of Spittlefields market. The  house, though it has undergone several repairs, still exhibits the  appearance of one of those that formed a part of old London. The weaving  art, which has arrived at such an astonishing perfection, was patronized  by the wise and liberal Edward III., who encouraged the art by the most  advantageous offers of reward and encouragement to weavers who would  come and settle in England. In 1331, two weavers came from Brabant and  settled at York. The superior skill and dexterity of these men, who  communicated their knowledge to others, soon manifested itself in the  improvement and spread of the art of weaving in this island. Many  Flemish weavers were driven from their native country by the cruel  persecutions of the Duke d'Alva, in 1567. They settled in different  parts of England, and introduced and promoted the manufacture of baizes,  serges, crapes, &c. The arts of spinning, throwing, and weaving silk,  were brought into England about the middle of the fifteenth century, and  were practised by a company of women in London, called silk women. About  1480, men began to engage in the silk manufacture, and in the year 1686,  nearly 50,000 manufacturers, of various descriptions, took refuge in  England, in consequence of the revocation of the Edict of Nantz, by  Louis le Grand, who sent thousands (says Pennant) of the most  industrious of his subjects into this kingdom to present his bitterest  enemies with the arts and manufactures of his kingdom; hence the origin  of the silk trade in Spittlefields.    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      THE BIRD OF THE TOMB.    BY LEIGH CLIFFE.    (_For the Mirror_.)      In \"Lyon's attempt to reach Repulse Bay,\" the following passage, which  suggested these verses, may be met with. \"Near the large grave was a  third pile of stones, covering the body of a child. A Snow-Buntin (the  Red-Breast of the Arctic Regions) had found its way through the loose  stones which composed this little tomb, and its now forsaken, neatly  built nest, was found placed on the neck of the child.\"        Beneath the chilly Arctic clime,    Where Nature reigns severe, sublime,    Enthron'd upon eternal snows,    Or rides the waves on icy floes--    Where fierce tremendous tempests sweep    The bosom of the rolling deep,    And beating rain, and drifting hail    Swell the wild fury of the gale;    There is a little, humble tomb,      Not deckt with sculpture's pageant pride,    Nor labour'd verse to tell by whom      The habitant was lov'd who died!    No trophied 'scutcheon marks the grave--    No blazon'd banners round it wave--    'Tis but a simple pile of stones    Rais'd o'er a hapless infant's bones;    Perchance a mother's tears have dew'd    This sepulchre, so frail and rude;--    A father mourn'd in accents wild,    His offspring lost--his only child--    Who might, in after years, have spread    A ray of honour round his head,    Nor thought, as stone on stone he threw,    His child would meet a stranger's view.      But, lo! upon its clay-cold breast,    The Arctic Robin rais'd its nest,    And rear'd its little fluttering young,      Where Death in awful quiet slept,    And fearless chirp'd, and gaily sung      Around the babe its parents wept.    It was the guardian of the grave,      And thus its chirping seem'd to say:--    \"Tho' naught from Death's chill grasp could save,      Tho' naught could chase his power away--    As round this humble spot I wing,    My thrilling voice shall daily sing    A requiem o'er the faded flower,    That bloom'd and wither'd in an hour,    And prov'd life is, in every view,    Naught but a rose-bud twin'd with rue.    A blossom born at day's first light,    And fading with the earliest night;    Nor stranger's step, nor shrieking loom,    Shall scare the warbler from the tomb'\"             *       *       *       *       *      CURING THE \"KING'S EVIL.\"    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)      About five miles from Sturminster Newton, and near the village of  Hazlebury, resides a Dr. B----, who has attained a reputation, far  extended, for curing, in a miraculous manner, the king's evil; and as  the method he employs is very different from that of most modern  practitioners, a short account of it may, perhaps, be acceptable to the  readers of the MIRROR.    I had long known that the doctor used some particular season for his  operations, but was unable to say precisely the time, until a few days  since I had a conversation with a person who is well acquainted with the  doctor and his yearly \"_fair, or feast_,\" as it is termed. Exactly  twenty-four hours before the new moon, in the month of May, every year,  whether it happens by night or by day, the afflicted persons assemble at  the doctor's residence, where they are supplied, by him, with the hind  legs of a _toad!_ yes, gentle reader a toad--don't start--enclosed in a  small bag (accompanied, I believe, with some verbal charm, or  incantation,) and also a lotion and salve of the doctor's preparation.  The bag containing the legs of the reptile is worn suspended from the  neck of the patient, and the lotion and salve applied in the usual  manner, until the cure is completed, or until the next year's \"_fair_.\"    One would think that such a mysterious routine of doctoring, would  attract but few, and those the most illiterate; but I can assure my  readers the case is different. The number of carts, chaises, and other  conveyances laden with the afflicted which passed through this place on  the 2nd instant, bore ample testimony to the number of the doctor's  applicants; and the appearance of many of them corroborated the opinion  that they moved in a respectable sphere of life.    The new moon happening this year on the 3rd instant, at 57 minutes past  7 o'clock in the morning, the \"fair\" took place at the same hour the  preceding day.    My readers, no doubt, have heard of the efficacy of the stone in the  toad's head, alluded to by Shakspeare,[2] for curing the cramp, &c. by  application to the afflicted part; but it was left for Dr. B---- to  discover the virtues of a toad's leg. Apropos, an eccentric friend of  mine, once gravely told me he intended to procure this precious Bufonian  jewel; and as probably some reader may feel a wish to possess it, I will  furnish him with the proper method of obtaining it, as communicated by  my scientific friend. Voici--Cut off poor bufo's head and enclose it in  a small box pierced with many holes; place it in an ant hill, and let it  remain some ten or twelve days, in which time, or a little longer, the  ants will have entered and eaten up every part except the stone. RURIS.          [2] \"Sweet are the uses of Adversity,          Which, like a toad, ugly and venomous,          Wears yet, a precious jewel in his head.\"             *       *       *       *       *      \"THE MORNING STAR.\"    (_For the Mirror_.)        Queen of celestial beauty! Morning Star!      Accept a humble bard's untut'red lay;    To him, thy loveliness, surpasseth far      The silv'ry moon, and eke the God of day.    The world with all its pride cannot display      A form so fair, so beautiful as thine;    Its glories fade, its proudest beauties die;      But you fair star! as first created shine,    In never fading immortality!    Like vice, from virtue's glance, yon clouds retire,      Before the smile of one benignant ray,    Sleepless and sad, my soul would fain aspire,    Promethean like, to snatch ethereal fire,      And draw relief from thee! bright harbinger of day!      JNO. JONES.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SKETCH-BOOK           *       *       *       *       *      SCHINDERHANNES, THE GERMAN ROBBER.      At the commencement of the French Revolution, and for some time after,  the two banks of the Rhine were the theatre of continual wars. Commerce  was interrupted, industry destroyed, the fields ravaged, and the barns  and cottages plundered; farmers and merchants became bankrupts, and  journeymen and labourers thieves. Robbery was the only mechanical art  which was worth pursuing, and the only exercises followed were assault  and battery. These enterprises were carried on at first by individuals  trading on their own capital of skill and courage; but when the French  laws came into more active operation in the seat of their exploits,  the desperadoes formed themselves, for mutual protection, into  copartnerships, which were the terror of the country. Men soon arose  among them whose talents, or prowess, attracted the confidence of  their comrades, and chiefs were elected, and laws and institutions  established. Different places of settlement were chosen by different  societies; the famous Pickard carried his band into Belgium and Holland;  while on the confines of Germany, where the wild provinces of Kirn,  Simmerm, and Birkenfield offered a congenial field, the banditti were  concentrated, whose last and most celebrated chief, the redoubted  Schinderhannes, is the subject of this brief notice.    His predecessors, indeed, Finck, Peter the Black, Zughetto, and Seibert  were long before renowned among those who square their conduct by the  good old rule of clubs; they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#2)"],[1," be a just observation anywhere, as is made from the  situation of the old abbeys and monasteries, the clergy were excellent  judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country, and chose always to  plant in the best; I say, if it was a just observation in any case, it  was in this; for if there be a situation on the whole river between  Staines Bridge and Windsor Bridge pleasanter than another, it is this of  Hampton; close to the river, yet not offended by the rising of its waters  in floods or storms; near to the reflux of the tides, but not quite so  near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing  of the tides generally is the occasion of.  The gardens extend almost to  the bank of the river, yet are never overflowed; nor are there any  marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate, or the air  unwholesome on that account.  The river is high enough to be navigable,  and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid; so that the stream looks  always cheerful, not slow and sleeping, like a pond.  This keeps the  waters always clear and clean, the bottom in view, the fish playing and  in sight; and, in a word, it has everything that can make an inland (or,  as I may call it, a country) river pleasant and agreeable.    I shall sing you no songs here of the river in the first person of a  water-nymph, a goddess, and I know not what, according to the humour of  the ancient poets; I shall talk nothing of the marriage of old Isis, the  male river, with the beautiful Thame, the female river (a whimsey as  simple as the subject was empty); but I shall speak of the river as  occasion presents, as it really is made glorious by the splendour of its  shores, gilded with noble palaces, strong fortifications, large  hospitals, and public buildings; with the greatest bridge, and the  greatest city in the world, made famous by the opulence of its merchants,  the increase and extensiveness of its commerce; by its invincible navies,  and by the innumerable fleets of ships sailing upon it to and from all  parts of the world.    As I meet with the river upwards in my travels through the inland country  I shall speak of it, as it is the channel for conveying an infinite  quantity of provisions from remote counties to London, and enriching all  the counties again that lie near it by the return of wealth and trade  from the city; and in describing these things I expect both to inform and  divert my readers, and speak in a more masculine manner, more to the  dignity of the subject, and also more to their satisfaction, than I could  do any other way.    There is little more to be said of the Thames relating to Hampton Court,  than that it adds by its neighbourhood to the pleasure of the situation;  for as to passing by water to and from London, though in summer it is  exceeding pleasant, yet the passage is a little too long to make it easy  to the ladies, especially to be crowded up in the small boats which  usually go upon the Thames for pleasure.    The prince and princess, indeed, I remember came once down by water upon  the occasion of her Royal Highness's being great with child, and near her  time--so near that she was delivered within two or three days after.  But  this passage being in the royal barges, with strength of oars, and the  day exceeding fine, the passage, I say, was made very pleasant, and still  the more so for being short.  Again, this passage is all the way with the  stream, whereas in the common passage upwards great part of the way is  against the stream, which is slow and heavy.    But be the going and coming how it will by water, it is an exceeding  pleasant passage by land, whether we go by the Surrey side or the  Middlesex side of the water, of which I shall say more in its place.    The situation of Hampton Court being thus mentioned, and its founder, it  is to be mentioned next that it fell to the Crown in the forfeiture of  his Eminence the Cardinal, when the king seized his effects and estate,  by which this and Whitehall (another house of his own building also) came  to King Henry VIII.  Two palaces fit for the kings of England, erected by  one cardinal, are standing monuments of the excessive pride as well as  the immense wealth of that prelate, who knew no bounds of his insolence  and ambition till he was overthrown at once by the displeasure of his  master.    Whoever knew Hampton Court before it was begun to be rebuilt, or altered,  by the late King William, must acknowledge it was a very complete palace  before, and fit for a king; and though it might not, according to the  modern method of building or of gardening, pass for a thing exquisitely  fine, yet it had this remaining to itself, and perhaps peculiar--namely,  that it showed a situation exceedingly capable of improvement, and of  being made one of the most delightful palaces in Europe.    This her Majesty Queen Mary was so sensible of, that, while the king had  ordered the pulling down the old apartments, and building it up in that  most beautiful form which we see them now appear in, her Majesty,  impatient of enjoying so agreeable a retreat, fixed upon a building  formerly made use of chiefly for landing from the river, and therefore  called the Water Galley, and here, as if she had been conscious that she  had but a few years to enjoy it, she ordered all the little neat curious  things to be done which suited her own conveniences, and made it the  pleasantest little thing within doors that could possibly be made, though  its situation being such as it could not be allowed to stand after the  great building was finished, we now see no remains of it.    The queen had here her gallery of beauties, being the pictures at full-  length of the principal ladies attending upon her Majesty, or who were  frequently in her retinue; and this was the more beautiful sight because  the originals were all in being, and often to be compared with their  pictures.  Her Majesty had here a fine apartment, with a set of lodgings  for her private retreat only, but most exquisitely furnished,  particularly a fine chintz bed, then a great curiosity; another of her  own work while in Holland, very magnificent, and several others; and here  was also her Majesty's fine collection of Delft ware, which indeed was  very large and fine; and here was also a vast stock of fine china ware,  the like whereof was not then to be seen in England; the long gallery, as  above, was filled with this china, and every other place where it could  be placed with advantage.    The queen had here also a small bathing-room, made very fine, suited  either to hot or cold bathing, as the season should invite; also a dairy,  with all its conveniences, in which her Majesty took great delight.  All  these things were finished with expedition, that here their Majesties  might repose while they saw the main building go forward.  While this was  doing, the gardens were laid out, the plan of them devised by the king  himself, and especially the amendments and alterations were made by the  king or the queen's particular special command, or by both, for their  Majesties agreed so well in their fancy, and had both so good judgment in  the just proportions of things, which are the principal beauties of a  garden, that it may be said they both ordered everything that was done.    Here the fine parcel of limes which form the semicircle on the south  front of the house by the iron gates, looking into the park, were by the  dexterous hand of the head gardener removed, after some of them had been  almost thirty years planted in other places, though not far off.  I know  the King of France in the decoration of the gardens of Versailles had  oaks removed, which by their dimensions must have been above an hundred  years old, and yet were taken up with so much art, and by the strength of  such engines, by which such a monstrous quantity of earth was raised with  them, that the trees could not feel their remove--that is to say, their  growth was not at all hindered.  This, I confess, makes the wonder much  the less in those trees at Hampton Court gardens; but the performance was  not the less difficult or nice, however, in these, and they thrive  perfectly well.    While the gardens were thus laid out, the king also directed the laying  the pipes for the fountains and _jet-d'eaux_, and particularly the  dimensions of them, and what quantity of water they should cast up, and  increased the number of them after the first design.    The ground on the side of the other front has received some alterations  since the taking down the Water Galley; but not that part immediately  next the lodgings.  The orange-trees and fine Dutch bays are placed  within the arches of the building under the first floor; so that the  lower part of the house was all one as a greenhouse for sometime.  Here  stand advanced, on two pedestals of stone, two marble vases or flower-  pots of most exquisite workmanship--the one done by an Englishman, and  the other by a German.  It is hard to say which is the best performance,  though the doing of it was a kind of trial of skill between them; but it  gives us room, without any partiality, to say they were both masters of  their art.    The _parterre_ on that side descends from the terrace-walk by steps, and  on the left a terrace goes down to the water-side, from which the garden  on the eastward front is overlooked, and gives a most pleasant prospect.    The fine scrolls and _bordure_ of these gardens were at first edged with  box, but on the queen's disliking the smell those edgings were taken up,  but have since been planted again--at least, in many places--nothing  making so fair and regular an edging as box, or is so soon brought to its  perfection.    On the north side of the house, where the gardens seemed to want  screening from the weather or the view of the chapel, and some part of  the old building required to be covered from the eye, the"]]]
