After having sat silent for a  while, gazing straight before him, and feeding the fire now and anon  with fir-cones, he suddenly began to complain that his political  activity had brought him but little satisfaction and few friends.  Nobody loved him for what he had done. He had never made anybody happy  thereby, he said, not himself, nor his family, nor any one else. Some  of those present would not admit this, and suggested \"that he had made  a great nation happy.\" \"But,\" he retorted, \"how many have I made  unhappy! But for me three great wars would not have been fought;  eighty thousand men would not have perished; parents, brothers,  sisters, and wives would not have been bereaved and plunged into  mourning.... That matter, however, I have settled with God.\" \"Settled  with God!\"--an amazing statement, a statement which would seem the  height of blasphemy if it were not an expression of noblest manliness,  if it did not reveal the soul of a warrior dauntlessly fighting for a  great cause, risking for it the existence of a whole country as well  as his own happiness, peace, and salvation, and being ready to submit  the consequences, whatever they might be, to the tribunal of eternity.  To say that a man who is willing to take such responsibilities as  these makes himself thereby an offender against morality appears to me  tantamount to condemning the Alps as obstructions to traffic. A  people, at any rate, that glories in the achievements of a Luther has  no right to cast a slur upon the motives of a Bismarck.    Whatever one may think of the worth of the cause for which Bismarck  battled all his life--the unity and greatness of Germany--it is  impossible not to admire the policy of moderation and self-restraint  pursued by him after every one of his most decisive victories. And  here again we note in him the peculiarly German military temper.  German war-songs do not glorify foreign conquest and brilliant  adventure; they glorify dogged resistance and bitter fight for house  and home, for kith and kin. The German army, composed as it is of  millions of peaceful citizens, is essentially a weapon of defense. And  it can truly be said that Bismarck, with all his natural  aggressiveness and ferocity, was in the main a defender, not a  conqueror. He defended Prussia against the intolerable arrogance and  un-German policy of Austria; he defended Germany against French  interference in the work of national consolidation; he defended the  principle of State sovereignty against the encroachments of the  Papacy; he defended the monarchy against the republicanism of the  Liberals and Socialists; and the supreme aim of his foreign policy  after the establishment of the German Empire was to guard the peace of  Europe.    The third predominant trait of Bismarck's character that stamps him as  a soldier--his unquestioning obedience to monarchical discipline--is  so closely bound up with the peculiarly German conceptions of the  functions and the Purpose of the State, that it will be better to  approach this Part of his nature from the political instead of the  military side.    II    In no other of the leading countries of the world has the _laissez  faire_ doctrine had as little influence in political matters as in  Germany. Luther, the fearless champion of religious individualism,  was, in questions of government, the most pronounced advocate of  paternalism. Kant, the cool dissector of the human intellect, was at  the same time the most rigid upholder of corporate morality. It was  Fichte, the ecstatic proclaimer of the glory of the individual will,  who wrote this dithyramb on the necessity of the constant surrender of  private interests to the common welfare: \"Nothing can live by itself  or for itself; everything lives in the whole; and the whole  continually sacrifices itself to itself in order to live anew. This is  the law of life. Whatever has come to the consciousness of existence  must fall a victim to the progress of all existence. Only there is a  difference whether you are dragged to the shambles like a beast with  bandaged eyes, or whether, in full and joyous presentiment of the life  which will spring forth from your sacrifice, you offer yourself freely  on the altar of eternity.\"    Not even Plato and Aristotle went so far in the deification of the  State as Hegel. And if Hegel declared that the real office of the  State is not to further individual interests, to protect private  property, but to be an embodiment of the organic unity of public life;  if he saw the highest task and the real freedom of the individual in  making himself a part of this organic unity of public life, he voiced  a sentiment which was fully shared by the leading classes of the  Prussia of his time, and which has since become a part of the  political creed of the Socialist masses all over Germany.    Here we have the moral background of Bismarck's internal policy. His  monarchism rested not only on his personal allegiance to the  hereditary dynasty, although no medieval knight could have been more  steadfast in his loyalty to his liege lord than Bismarck was in his  unswerving devotion to the Hohenzollern house. His monarchism  rested above all on the conviction that, under the present  conditions of German political life, no other form of government would  insure equally well the fulfilment of the moral obligations of the  State.    [Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK _From the Painting by Franz von  Lenbach_ COURTESY OF MR. HUGO RESINGER NEW YORK]    He was by no means blind to the value of parliamentary institutions.  More than once has he described the English Constitution as the  necessary outcome and the fit expression of the vital forces of  English society. More than once has he eulogized the sterling  political qualities of English landlordism, its respect for the law,  its common sense, its noble devotion to national interests. More than  once has he deplored the absence in Germany of \"the class which in  England is the main support of the State--the class of wealthy and  therefore conservative gentlemen, independent of material interests,  whose whole education is directed with a view to their becoming  statesmen, and whose only aim in life is to take part in public  affairs\"; and the absence of \"a Parliament, like the English,  containing two sharply defined parties whereof one forms a sure and  unswerving majority which subjects itself with iron discipline to its  ministerial leaders.\" We may regret that Bismarck himself did not do  more to develop parliamentary discipline; that, indeed, he did  everything in his power to arrest the healthy growth of German party  life. But it is at least perfectly clear that his reasons for refusing  to allow the German parties a controlling influence in shaping the  policy of the government were not the result of mere despotic caprice,  but were founded upon thoroughly German traditions, and upon a  thoroughly sober, though one-sided, view of the present state of  German public affairs.    To him party government appeared as much of an impossibility as it had  appeared to Hegel. The attempt to establish it would, in his opinion,  have led to nothing less than chaos. The German parties, as he viewed  them, represented, not the State, not the nation, but an infinite  variety of private and class interests--the interests of landholders,  traders, manufacturers, laborers, politicians, priests, and so on;  each particular set of interests desiring the particular consideration  of the public treasury, and refusing the same amount of consideration  to every other. It seemed highly desirable to him, as it did to Hegel,  that all these interests should be heard; that they should be  represented in a Parliament based upon as wide and liberal a suffrage  as possible. But to intrust any one of these interests with the  functions of government would, in his opinion, have been treason to  the State; it would have been class tyranny of the worst kind.    The logical outcome of all this was his conviction of the absolute  necessity, for Germany, of a strong non-partisan government: a  government which should hold all the conflicting class interests in  check and force them into continual compromises with one another; a  government which should be unrestricted by any class prejudices,  pledges, or theories, and have no other guiding star than the welfare  of the whole nation. And the only basis for such a government he found  in the Prussian monarchy, with its glorious tradition of military  discipline, of benevolent paternalism, and of self-sacrificing  devotion to national greatness; with its patriotic gentry, its  incorruptible courts, its religious freedom, its enlightened  educational system, its efficient and highly trained civil service. To  bow before such a monarchy, to serve such a State, was indeed  something different from submitting to the chance vote of a  parliamentary majority; in this bondage even a Bismarck could find his  highest freedom.    For nearly forty years he bore this bondage; for twenty-eight he stood  in the place nearest to the monarch himself; and not even his enemies  dared to assert that his political conduct was guided by other motives  than the consideration of public welfare. Indeed, if there is any  phrase for which he, the apparent cynic, the sworn despiser of  phrases, seems to have had a certain weakness, it is the word _salus  publica_. To it he sacrificed his days and his nights; for it he more  than once risked his life; for it he incurred more hatred and slander  than perhaps any man of his time; for it he alienated his best  friends; for it he turned not once or twice, but one might almost say  habitually, against his own cherished prejudices and convictions.

It was found  at the inquest that he had strangled that monster, Mrs. Kesselbach, whose  crimes came to light afterward, and that he hanged himself after setting  fire to the chalet.\"    \"It was a fitting end for that--rascal,\" said M. Desmalions, \"and I  confess that I, for my part, much prefer not having him to fight against.  Let's see, where were we? Are the papers of the Mornington inheritance  ready for me?\"    \"On your desk, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Good. But I was forgetting: is Inspector Verot here?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet. I expect he's in the infirmary getting  something to pull him together.\"    \"Why, what's the matter with him?\"    \"He struck me as being in a queer state--rather ill.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    The secretary described his interview with Inspector Verot.    \"And you say he left a letter for me?\" said M. Desmalions with a worried  air. \"Where is it?\"    \"Among the papers, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Very odd: it's all very odd. Verot is a first-rate inspector, a very  sober-minded fellow; and he doesn't get frightened easily. You might go  and fetch him. Meanwhile, I'll look through my letters.\"    The secretary hurried away. When he returned, five minutes later,  he stated, with an air of astonishment, that he had not seen  Inspector Verot.    \"And what's more curious still,\" he added, \"is that the messenger who saw  him leave this room saw him come in again almost at once and did not see  him go out a second time.\"    \"Perhaps he only passed through here to go to you.\"    \"To me, Monsieur le Prefet? I was in my room all the time.\"    \"Then it's incomprehensible.\"    \"Yes ... unless we conclude that the messenger's attention was distracted  for a second, as Verot is neither here nor next door.\"    \"That must be it. I expect he's gone to get some air outside; and he'll  be back at any moment. For that matter, I shan't want him to start with.\"    The Prefect looked at his watch.    \"Ten past five. You might tell the messenger to show those gentlemen  in.... Wait, though--\"    M. Desmalions hesitated. In turning over the papers he had found Verot's  letter. It was a large, yellow, business envelope, with \"Cafe du  Pont-Neuf\" printed at the top.    The secretary suggested:    \"In view of Verot's absence, Monsieur le Prefet, and of what he said, it  might be as well for you to see what's in the letter first.\"    M. Desmalions paused to reflect.    \"Perhaps you're right.\"    And, making up his mind, he inserted a paper-knife into the envelope and  cut it open. A cry escaped him.    \"Oh, I say, this is a little too much!\"    \"What is it, Monsieur le Prefet?\"    \"Why, look here, a blank ... sheet of paper! That's all the envelope  contains!\"    \"Impossible!\"    \"See for yourself--a plain sheet folded in four, with not a word on it.\"    \"But Verot told me in so many words that he had said in that letter all  that he knew about the case.\"    \"He told you so, no doubt, but there you are! Upon my word, if I  didn't know Inspector Verot, I should think he was trying to play a  game with me.\"    \"It's a piece of carelessness, Monsieur le Prefet, at the worst.\"    \"No doubt, a piece of carelessness, but I'm surprised at him. It doesn't  do to be careless when the lives of two people are at stake. For he must  have told you that there is a double murder planned for to-night?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet, and under particularly alarming conditions;  infernal was the word he used.\"    M. Desmalions was walking up and down the room, with his hands behind his  back. He stopped at a small table.    \"What's this little parcel addressed to me? 'Monsieur le Prefet de  Police--to be opened in case of accident.'\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said the secretary, \"I was forgetting! That's from Inspector  Verot, too; something of importance, he said, and serving to complete and  explain the contents of the letter.\"    \"Well,\" said M. Desmalions, who could not help laughing, \"the letter  certainly needs explaining; and, though there's no question of  'accident,' I may as well open the parcel.\"    As he spoke, he cut the string and discovered, under the paper, a box, a  little cardboard box, which might have come from a druggist, but which  was soiled and spoiled by the use to which it had been put.    He raised the lid. Inside the box were a few layers of cotton wool, which  were also rather dirty, and in between these layers was half a cake of  chocolate.    \"What the devil does this mean?\" growled the Prefect in surprise.    He took the chocolate, looked at it, and at once perceived what was  peculiar about this cake of chocolate, which was also undoubtedly the  reason why Inspector Verot had kept it. Above and below, it bore the  prints of teeth, very plainly marked, very plainly separated one from the  other, penetrating to a depth of a tenth of an inch or so into the  chocolate. Each possessed its individual shape and width, and each was  divided from its neighbours by a different interval. The jaws which had  started eating the cake of chocolate had dug into it the mark of four  upper and five lower teeth.    M. Desmalions remained wrapped in thought and, with his head sunk on his  chest, for some minutes resumed his walk up and down the room, muttering:    \"This is queer ... There's a riddle here to which I should like to know  the answer. That sheet of paper, the marks of those teeth: what does it  all mean?\"    But he was not the man to waste much time over a mystery which was bound  to be cleared up presently, as Inspector Verot must be either at the  police office or somewhere just outside; and he said to his secretary:    \"I can't keep those five gentlemen waiting any longer. Please have them  shown in now. If Inspector Verot arrives while they are here, as he is  sure to do, let me know at once. I want to see him as soon as he comes.  Except for that, see that I'm not disturbed on any pretext, won't you?\"            *       *       *       *       *    Two minutes later the messenger showed in Maitre Lepertuis, a stout,  red-faced man, with whiskers and spectacles, followed by Archibald  Bright, the Secretary of Embassy, and Caceres, the Peruvian attache. M.  Desmalions, who knew all three of them, chatted to them until he stepped  forward to receive Major Comte d'Astrignac, the hero of La Chouia, who  had been forced into premature retirement by his glorious wounds. The  Prefect was complimenting him warmly on his gallant conduct in Morocco  when the door opened once more.    \"Don Luis Perenna, I believe?\" said the Prefect, offering his hand to a  man of middle height and rather slender build, wearing the military medal  and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honour.    The newcomer's face and expression, his way of holding himself, and his  very youthful movements inclined one to look upon him as a man of forty,  though there were wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and on the  forehead, which perhaps pointed to a few years more. He bowed.    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Is that you, Perenna?\" cried Comte d'Astrignae. \"So you are still among  the living?\"    \"Yes, Major, and delighted to see you again.\"    \"Perenna alive! Why, we had lost all sight of you when I left Morocco! We  thought you dead.\"    \"I was a prisoner, that's all.\"    \"A prisoner of the tribesmen; the same thing!\"    \"Not quite, Major; one can escape from anywhere. The proof stands  before you.\"    The Prefect of Police, yielding to an irresistible attraction to resist,  spent some seconds in examining that powerful face, with the smiling  glance, the frank and resolute eyes, and the bronzed complexion, which  looked as if it had been baked and baked again by the sun.    Then, motioning to his visitors to take chairs around his desk, M.  Desmalions himself sat down and made a preliminary statement in clear and  deliberate tones:    \"The summons, gentlemen, which I addressed to each of you, must have  appeared to you rather peremptory and mysterious. And the manner in which  I propose to open our conversation is not likely to diminish your  surprise. But if you will attach a little credit to my method, you will  soon realize that the whole thing is very simple and very natural. I will  be as brief as I can.\"    He spread before him the bundle of documents prepared for him by his  secretary and, consulting his notes as he spoke, continued:    \"Over fifty years ago, in 1860, three sisters, three orphans, Ermeline,  Elizabeth, and Armande Roussel, aged twenty-two, twenty, and eighteen  respectively, were living at Saint-Etienne with a cousin named Victor,  who was a few years younger. The eldest, Ermeline, was the first to leave  Saint-Etienne. She went to London, where she married an Englishman of the  name Mornington, by whom she had a son, who was christened Cosmo.    \"The family was very poor and went through hard times. Ermeline  repeatedly wrote to her sisters to ask for a little assistance. Receiving  no reply, she broke off the correspondence altogether. In 1870 Mr. and  Mrs. Mornington left England for America. Five years later they were  rich. Mr. Mornington died in 1878; but his widow continued to administer  the fortune bequeathed to her and, as she had a genius for business and  speculation, she increased this fortune until it attained a colossal  figure. At her decease, in 1900, she left her son the sum of four hundred  million francs.\"    The amount seemed to make an impression on the Prefect's hearers. He saw  the major and Don Luis Perenna exchange a glance and asked:    \"You knew Cosmo Mornington, did you not?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet,\" replied Comte d'Astrignac. \"He was in Morocco  when Perenna and I were fighting there.\"    \"Just so,\" said M. Desmalions. \"Cosmo Mornington had begun to travel  about the world. He took up the practise of medicine, from what I hear,  and, when occasion offered, treated the sick with great skill and,"]]]
