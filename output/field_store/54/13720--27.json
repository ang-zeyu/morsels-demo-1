But the fact  is, as every thoughtful inquirer is aware, that the whole progress of  civilization, whether in the individual or the race, consists largely in  a \"sublimation\" of infantile instincts, and especially certain portions  of the sexual instinct, to other ends than those which they seemed  designed to serve. Art and poetry are fed on this fuel and the evolution  of character and mental force is largely of the same origin. All the  forms which this sublimation, or the abortive attempts at sublimation,  may take in any given case, should come out in the course of a thorough  psychoanalysis. It is not the sexual life alone, but every interest and  every motive, that must be inquired into by the physician who is seeking  to obtain all the data about the patient, necessary for his reeducation  and his cure. But all the thoughts and emotions and desires and motives  which appear in the man or woman of adult years were once crudely  represented in the obscure instincts of the infant, and among these  instincts those which were concerned directly or indirectly with the  sexual emotions, in a wide sense, are certain to be found in every case  to have been the most important for the end-result.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION      Although the author is fully aware of the gaps and obscurities contained  in this small volume, he has, nevertheless, resisted a temptation to add  to it the results obtained from the investigations of the last five  years, fearing that thus its unified and documentary character would be  destroyed. He accordingly reproduces the original text with but slight  modifications, contenting himself with the addition of a few footnotes.  For the rest, it is his ardent wish that this book may speedily become  antiquated--to the end that the new material brought forward in it may  be universally accepted, while the shortcomings it displays may give  place to juster views.    VIENNA, December, 1909.          AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION      After watching for ten years the reception accorded to this book and the  effect it has produced, I wish to provide the third edition of it with  some prefatory remarks dealing with the misunderstandings of the book  and the demands, insusceptible of fulfillment, made against it. Let me  emphasize in the first place that whatever is here presented is derived  entirely from every-day medical experience which is to be made more  profound and scientifically important through the results of  psychoanalytic investigation. The \"Three Contributions to the Theory of  Sex\" can contain nothing except what psychoanalysis obliges them to  accept or what it succeeds in corroborating. It is therefore excluded  that they should ever be developed into a \"theory of sex,\" and it is  also quite intelligible that they will assume no attitude at all towards  some important problems of the sexual life. This should not however give  the impression that these omitted chapters of the great theme were  unfamiliar to the author, or that they were neglected by him as  something of secondary importance.    The dependence of this work on the psychoanalytic experiences which have  determined the writing of it, shows itself not only in the selection but  also in the arrangement of the material. A certain succession of stages  was observed, the occasional factors are rendered prominent, the  constitutional ones are left in the background, and the ontogenetic  development receives greater consideration than the phylogenetic. For  the occasional factors play the principal role in analysis, and are  almost completely worked up in it, while the constitutional factors only  become evident from behind as elements which have been made functional  through experience, and a discussion of these would lead far beyond the  working sphere of psychoanalysis.    A similar connection determines the relation between ontogenesis and  phylogenesis. Ontogenesis may be considered as a repetition of  phylogenesis insofar as the latter has not been varied by a more recent  experience. The phylogenetic disposition makes itself visible behind the  ontogenetic process. But fundamentally the constitution is really the  precipitate of a former experience of the species to which the newer  experience of the individual being is added as the sum of the occasional  factors.    Beside its thoroughgoing dependence on psychoanalytic investigation I  must emphasize as a character of this work of mine its intentional  independence of biological investigation. I have carefully avoided the  inclusion of the results of scientific investigation in general sex  biology or of particular species of animals in this study of human  sexual functions which is made possible by the technique of  psychoanalysis. My aim was indeed to find out how much of the biology of  the sexual life of man can be discovered by means of psychological  investigation; I was able to point to additions and agreements which  resulted from this examination, but I did not have to become confused if  the psychoanalytic methods led in some points to views and results which  deviated considerably from those merely based on biology.    I have added many passages in this edition, but I have abstained from  calling attention to them, as in former editions, by special marks. The  scientific work in our sphere has at present been retarded in its  progress, nevertheless some supplements to this work were indispensable  if it was to remain in touch with our newer psychoanalytic literature.    VIENNA, October, 1914.          I    THE SEXUAL ABERRATIONS[1]      The fact of sexual need in man and animal is expressed in biology by the  assumption of a \"sexual impulse.\" This impulse is made analogous to the  impulse of taking nourishment, and to hunger. The sexual expression  corresponding to hunger not being found colloquilly, science uses the  expression \"libido.\"[2]    Popular conception makes definite assumptions concerning the nature and  qualities of this sexual impulse. It is supposed to be absent during  childhood and to commence about the time of and in connection with the  maturing process of puberty; it is supposed that it manifests itself in  irresistible attractions exerted by one sex upon the other, and that its  aim is sexual union or at least such actions as would lead to union.    But we have every reason to see in these assumptions a very  untrustworthy picture of reality. On closer examination they are found  to abound in errors, inaccuracies and hasty conclusions.    If we introduce two terms and call the person from whom the sexual  attraction emanates the _sexual object_, and the action towards which  the impulse strives the _sexual aim_, then the scientifically examined  experience shows us many deviations in reference to both sexual object  and sexual aim, the relations of which to the accepted standard require  thorough investigation.      1. DEVIATION IN REFERENCE TO THE SEXUAL OBJECT    The popular theory of the sexual impulse corresponds closely to the  poetic fable of dividing the person into two halves--man and woman--who  strive to become reunited through love. It is therefore very surprising  to hear that there are men for whom the sexual object is not woman but  man, and that there are women for whom it is not man but woman. Such  _persons_ are called contrary sexuals, or better, inverts; the  _condition_, that of inversion. The number of such individuals is  considerable though difficult of accurate determination.[3]      A. _Inversion_    *The Behavior of Inverts.*--The above-mentioned persons behave in many  ways quite differently.    (_a_) They are absolutely inverted; _i.e._, their sexual object must be  always of the same sex, while the opposite sex can never be to them an  object of sexual longing, but leaves them indifferent or may even evoke  sexual repugnance. As men they are unable, on account of this  repugnance, to perform the normal sexual act or miss all pleasure in its  performance.    (_b_) They are amphigenously inverted (psychosexually hermaphroditic);  _i.e._, their sexual object may belong indifferently to either the same  or to the other sex. The inversion lacks the character of exclusiveness.    (_c_) They are occasionally inverted; _i.e._, under certain external  conditions, chief among which are the inaccessibility of the normal  sexual object and initiation, they are able to take as the sexual  object a person of the same sex and thus find sexual gratification.    The inverted also manifest a manifold behavior in their judgment about  the peculiarities of their sexual impulse. Some take the inversion as a  matter of course, just as the normal person does regarding his libido,  firmly demanding the same rights as the normal. Others, however, strive  against the fact of their inversion and perceive in it a morbid  compulsion.[4]    Other variations concern the relations of time. The characteristics of  the inversion in any individual may date back as far as his memory goes,  or they may become manifest to him at a definite period before or after  puberty.[5] The character is either retained throughout life, or it  occasionally recedes or represents an episode on the road to normal  development. A periodical fluctuation between the normal and the  inverted sexual object has also been observed.

I. _Cicero as a Student of Philosophy and Man of  Letters:_ 90--45 B.C.    It would seem that Cicero's love for literature was inherited from his  father, who, being of infirm health, lived constantly at Arpinum, and spent  the greater part of his time in study.[1] From him was probably derived  that strong love for the old Latin dramatic and epic poetry which his son  throughout his writings displays. He too, we may conjecture, led the young  Cicero to feel the importance of a study of philosophy to serve as a  corrective for the somewhat narrow rhetorical discipline of the time.[2]    Cicero's first systematic lessons in philosophy were given him by the  Epicurean Phaedrus, then at Rome because of the unsettled state of Athens,  whose lectures he attended at a very early age, even before he had assumed  the toga virilis. The pupil seems to have been converted at once to the  tenets of the master.[3] Phaedrus remained to the end of his life a friend  of Cicero, who speaks warmly in praise of his teacher's amiable disposition  and refined style. He is the only Epicurean, with, perhaps, the exception  of Lucretius, whom the orator ever allows to possess any literary power.[4]  Cicero soon abandoned Epicureanism, but his schoolfellow, T. Pomponius  Atticus, received more lasting impressions from the teaching of Phaedrus.  It was probably at this period of their lives that Atticus and his friend  became acquainted with Patro, who succeeded Zeno of Sidon as head of the  Epicurean school.[5]    At this time (i.e. before 88 B.C.) Cicero also heard the lectures of  Diodotus the Stoic, with whom he studied chiefly, though not exclusively,  the art of dialectic.[6] This art, which Cicero deems so important to the  orator that he calls it \"abbreviated eloquence,\" was then the monopoly of  the Stoic school. For some time Cicero spent all his days with Diodotus in  the severest study, but he seems never to have been much attracted by the  general Stoic teaching. Still, the friendship between the two lasted till  the death of Diodotus, who, according to a fashion set by the Roman Stoic  circle of the time of Scipio and Laelius, became an inmate of Cicero's  house, where he died in B.C. 59, leaving his pupil heir to a not  inconsiderable property.[7] He seems to have been one of the most  accomplished men of his time, and Cicero's feelings towards him were those  of gratitude, esteem, and admiration.[8]    In the year 88 B.C. the celebrated Philo of Larissa, then head of the  Academic school, came to Rome, one of a number of eminent Greeks who fled  from Athens on the approach of its siege during the Mithridatic war. Philo,  like Diodotus, was a man of versatile genius: unlike the Stoic philosopher,  he was a perfect master both of the theory and the practice of oratory.  Cicero had scarcely heard him before all inclination for Epicureanism was  swept from his mind, and he surrendered himself wholly, as he tells us, to  the brilliant Academic.[9] Smitten with a marvellous enthusiasm he  abandoned all other studies for philosophy. His zeal was quickened by the  conviction that the old judicial system of Rome was overthrown for ever,  and that the great career once open to an orator was now barred.[10]    We thus see that before Cicero was twenty years of age, he had been brought  into intimate connection with at least three of the most eminent  philosophers of the age, who represented the three most vigorous and  important Greek schools. It is fair to conclude that he must have become  thoroughly acquainted with their spirit, and with the main tenets of each.  His own statements, after every deduction necessitated by his egotism has  been made, leave no doubt about his diligence as a student. In his later  works he often dwells on his youthful devotion to philosophy.[11] It would  be unwise to lay too much stress on the intimate connection which subsisted  between the rhetorical and the ethical teaching of the Greeks; but there  can be little doubt that from the great rhetorician Molo, then Rhodian  ambassador at Rome, Cicero gained valuable information concerning the  ethical part of Greek philosophy.    During the years 88--81 B.C., Cicero employed himself incessantly with the  study of philosophy, law, rhetoric, and belles lettres. Many ambitious  works in the last two departments mentioned were written by him at this  period. On Sulla's return to the city after his conquest of the Marian  party in Italy, judicial affairs once more took their regular course, and  Cicero appeared as a pleader in the courts, the one philosophic orator of  Rome, as he not unjustly boasts[12]. For two years he was busily engaged,  and then suddenly left Rome for a tour in Eastern Hellas. It is usually  supposed that he came into collision with Sulla through the freedman  Chrysogonus, who was implicated in the case of Roscius. The silence of  Cicero is enough to condemn this theory, which rests on no better evidence  than that of Plutarch. Cicero himself, even when mentioning his speech in  defence of Roscius, never assigns any other cause for his departure than  his health, which was being undermined by his passionate style of  oratory[13].    The whole two years 79--77 B.C. were spent in the society of Greek  philosophers and rhetoricians. The first six months passed at Athens, and  were almost entirely devoted to philosophy, since, with the exception of  Demetrius Syrus, there were no eminent rhetorical teachers at that time  resident in the city[14]. By the advice of Philo himself[15], Cicero  attended the lectures of that clear thinker and writer, as Diogenes calls  him[16], Zeno of Sidon, now the head of the Epicurean school. In Cicero's  later works there are several references to his teaching. He was biting and  sarcastic in speech, and spiteful in spirit, hence in striking contrast to  Patro and Phaedrus[17]. It is curious to find that Zeno is numbered by  Cicero among those pupils and admirers of Carneades whom he had known[18].  Phaedrus was now at Athens, and along with Atticus who loved him beyond all  other philosophers[19], Cicero spent much time in listening to his  instruction, which was eagerly discussed by the two pupils[20]. Patro was  probably in Athens at the same time, but this is nowhere explicitly stated.  Cicero must at this time have attained an almost complete familiarity with  the Epicurean doctrines.    There seem to have been no eminent representatives of the Stoic school then  at Athens. Nor is any mention made of a Peripatetic teacher whose lectures  Cicero might have attended, though M. Pupius Piso, a professed Peripatetic,  was one of his companions in this sojourn at Athens[21]. Only three notable  Peripatetics were at this time living. Of these Staseas of Naples, who  lived some time in Piso's house, was not then at Athens[22]; it is  probable, however, from a mention of him in the De Oratore, that Cicero  knew himm through Piso. Diodorus, the pupil of Critolaus, is frequently  named by Cicero, but never as an acquaintance. Cratippus was at this time  unknown to him.    The philosopher from whose lessons Cicero certainly learned most at this  period was Antiochus of Ascalon, now the representative of a Stoicised  Academic school. Of this teacher, however, I shall have to treat later,  when I shall attempt to estimate the influence he exercised over our  author. It is sufficient here to say that on the main point which was in  controversy between Philo and Antiochus, Cicero still continued to think  with his earlier teacher. His later works, however, make it evident that he  set a high value on the abilities and the learning of Antiochus, especially  in dialectic, which was taught after Stoic principles. Cicero speaks of him  as eminent among the philosophers of the time, both for talent and  acquirement [23]; as a man of acute intellect[24]; as possessed of a  pointed style[25]; in fine, as the most cultivated and keenest of the  philosophers of the age[26]. A considerable friendship sprang up between  Antiochus and Cicero[27], which was strengthened by the fact that many  friends of the latter, such as Piso, Varro, Lucullus and Brutus, more or  less adhered to the views of Antiochus. It is improbable that Cicero at  this time became acquainted with Aristus the brother of Antiochus, since in  the Academica[28] he is mentioned in such a way as to show that he was  unknown to Cicero in B.C. 62.    The main purpose of Cicero while at Athens had been to learn philosophy; in  Asia and at Rhodes he devoted himself chiefly to rhetoric, under the  guidance of"]]]
