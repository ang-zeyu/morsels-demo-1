This often makes a great difference of effect in  the reproduction and sometimes makes it impossible to get satisfactory  results at all, especially in delicate drawings.    Pencil drawings made with light lines will not reproduce well, as there  is too little contrast in color between the lines and the paper; but  sketches made with a soft pencil and strong contrasts frequently give  surprisingly good results.    When drawings are to be made, especially for reproduction, the question  of expense is often of importance. Plates made from pen drawings now  cost about ten cents a square inch, while half-tone plates made of metal  for printing on an ordinary printing press with type matter cost about  twenty-five cents a square inch.    By using specially prepared process papers, which, if not sold by a  local dealer in artists' materials, can be had of Messrs. Wadsworth,  Rowland & Co., or Frost & Adams, drawings can be made in pencil or black  crayon which can be reproduced by the cheaper process, and will give  excellent results. Considering the ease with which this work can be done  and the satisfactory results obtained, it is surprising that it has not  been more generally adopted. The only drawback to working upon this  paper is the fact that no erasures or changes can be made without  ruining the surface of the paper.    In connection with what has already been considered in relation to the  reproduction of drawings, it may be well to refer to the making of  plates from photographs. The selection of a good photograph is of the  first importance. It should be brilliant, and with all the contrast of  light and shade and as much detail as possible, for something is always  lost in both these respects in the process of reproduction. A good plate  can be made from a good photograph, but cannot from a bad one. The  process is the same as that referred to above for the reproduction of  wash drawings, etc., and the cost the same, about twenty-five cents a  square inch. The half-tone plates in THE BROCHURE SERIES, made by The  Blanchard & Watts Engraving Company, Boston, are good examples of  first-class work of this description.

The proceedings of the annual convention of the American Institute of  Architects, held last autumn in New York, have just been published, and  no less than five papers are included which deal with one or another  phase of this subject. The later numbers of the professional journals  also contain several noteworthy contributions to the discussion. Mr.  Barr Ferree's criticism in _The Architectural Review,_ of the methods of  training pursued in the School of Fine Arts in Paris, have led to  several papers by adherents of the French system and to a  well-considered editorial in the same paper. But the most important  contribution to the question is that of Mr. Henry Rutgers Marshall in  the last number of _The Architectural Record,_ which also contains a  descriptive article upon the Royal Polytechnicum at Berlin and its  course of study.    There is very little in any of these articles which adds to the existing  knowledge on this largely discussed subject; it is what might be  considered a rethreshing of old straw, and the main value of all of the  articles is in the presentation, which may appeal to readers who have  not before thought of the matter in all of its bearings. The papers read  before the convention begin with the report of the committee on  education, by Mr. Henry Van Brunt. In this Mr. Van Brunt advocates the  careful and systematic study of architectural history; and it was the  purpose of the report to bring out discussion which might lead to  valuable suggestions to the architectural schools upon the study of  this subject. Mr. Geo. B. Post, of New York, Professor Ware, of Columbia  College, and several others took part in the discussion which resulted  in merely recommitting the question to the committee on education, as it  was not considered advisable to take any definite action which would  bind the Institute to a settled policy on this question. Mr. Louis H.  Sullivan, of Chicago, in a thoughtful paper complained that education  stifles and kills the spirit of modern architectural work, and that the  natural and spontaneous love for beauty found in all human beings gives  place, under our modern systems of instruction, to the dry formalities  of reproducing old and dead styles.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Frank Miles Day and Mr. R.W. Gibson, each in his own way, described  the advantages of foreign travel and the best methods to pursue, as well  as the most important ends to be attained.    Mr. Russell Sturgis, in a scholarly paper upon the subject of Greek  architecture applied to modern buildings, gave a number of precepts for  the proper use of Greek forms and methods of building as applied to our  modern conditions. He closed his article with a lot of receipts much in  the style of an architectural cook book, for the application of his  theories concerning Greek architecture.    These articles, as will be seen from the above indications, dealt in  most cases with one phase only of architectural education. They are all  of course important in their way, as contributing to the general  discussion of the subject, but each in turn gives only a partial view.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Marshall, however, starts with the intention of making a full and  fair statement of existing conditions and logically draws his inferences  as to the best methods of meeting them. He has the valuable  qualification of being able to consider his subject judicially and of  writing excellent and readable English, as has already been pointed out  in these columns, in the review of his recently published book,  \"AEsthetic Principles.\"    He divides the subject for convenience into three main headings: first,  the use of tools, including in his classification the executive function  of handling men as well as tools in the narrower and legitimate sense;  second, the nature of materials employed; and third, the general  principles of beauty. Under the first heading Mr. Marshall makes one  important suggestion, which is at variance with common practice among  architects. After pointing out the importance of studying design in the  solid, that is, constantly keeping in mind that the forms which are to  be designed have three dimensions, and that a geometrical projection,  such as a plan or elevation, only partially represents its appearance,  he advocates the more general use of perspective drawing in designing.  By this is not meant the making of pretty sketches after the design is  all determined, to mislead impressionable clients, but the serious study  of a design to determine its appearance from different points of view.  In fact his suggestion is that the usual order of proceeding shall be  reversed, and that the design shall be made in perspective and then  translated into accurate terms of such geometrical projections as are  needed to guide the practical workman in carrying out the work.    In treating of materials Mr. Marshall takes up separately the materials  of construction and the materials of design, meaning by the latter the  vocabulary in which the architect expresses his ideas, or the  accumulation of architectural forms making up the various historic  styles, so-called. He emphasizes the importance--in which point he  agrees with all the other writers above referred to--of a wide and  catholic knowledge of architectural history and a careful study of all  styles.    In summing up in the portion of the article devoted to the general  principles of beauty as applied to architecture he gives a clear and  concise statement of the reasons why beauty is in itself a necessary and  desirable element in architecture, and roughly analyzes the conditions  under which it exists.             *       *       *       *       *      Brochure Series Competition, No. I.
