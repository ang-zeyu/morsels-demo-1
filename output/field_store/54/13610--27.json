In  reality, if one examines the nature of chocolate a little, with respect  to the constitution of aged persons, it seems as though the one was made  on purpose to remedy the defects of the other, and that it is truly the  panacea of old age.\"    The three associated beverages, cocoa, tea, and coffee are known to the  French as _aromatic_ drinks. Each of these has its characteristic aroma.  The fragrance and flavor are so marked that they cannot be imitated by  any artificial products, although numerous attempts have been made in  regard to all three. Hence the detection of adulteration is not a  difficult matter. Designing persons, aware of the extreme difficulty of  imitating these substances, have undertaken to employ lower grades, and,  by manipulation, copy, as far as may be, the higher sorts. Every one  knows how readily tea, and coffee, for that matter, will take up odors  and flavors from substances placed near them. This is abundantly  exemplified in the country grocery or general store, where the teas and  coffees share in the pervasive fragrance of the cheese and kerosene. But  perhaps it is not so widely understood that some of these very teas and  coffees had been artificially flavored or corrected before they reached  their destination in this country.    Cacao lends itself very readily to such preliminary treatment. In a  first-class article, the beans should be of the highest excellence; they  should be carefully grown on the plantation and there prepared with  great skill, arriving in the factory in good condition. In the factory  they should simply receive the mechanical treatment requisite to  develop their high and attractive natural flavor and fragrance. They  should be most carefully shelled after roasting and finely ground  without concealed additions. This is the process in all honest  manufactories of the cacao products.    Now, as a matter of fact, in the preparation of many of the cacao  products on the market, a wholly different course has been pursued.  Beans of poor quality are used, because of their cheapness, and in some  instances they are only imperfectly, if at all, shelled before grinding.  Chemical treatment is relied on to correct in part the odor and taste of  such inferior goods, and artificial flavors, other than the time-honored  natural vanilla and the like, are added freely. The detection of such  imposition is easy enough to the expert, but is difficult to the novice;  therefore the public is largely unable to discriminate between the good  and the inferior, and it is perforce compelled to depend almost entirely  on the character and reputation of the manufacturer.    A distinguished London Physician, in giving some hints concerning the  proper preparation of cocoa, says:    \"Start with a pure cocoa of undoubted quality and excellence of  manufacture, and which bears the name of a respectable firm. This point  is important, for there are many cocoas on the market which have been  doctored by the addition of alkali, starch, malt, kola, hops, etc.\"    Baker's Breakfast Cocoa is absolutely pure, and, being ground to an  extraordinary degree of fineness, is highly soluble. The analyst of the  Massachusetts State Board of Health states in his recent valuable work  on \"Food Inspection and Analysis,\" that the treatment of cocoa with  alkali for the purpose of producing a more perfect emulsion is  objectionable, even if not considered as a form of adulteration. Cocoa  thus treated is generally darker in color than the pure article. The  legitimate means, he says, for making it as soluble as possible is to  pulverize it very fine, so that particles remain in even suspension and  form a smooth paste.    That is the way the Baker Cocoa is treated. It has received the Grand  Prize--the highest award ever given in this country, and altogether 52  highest awards in Europe and America.          Choice Recipes by Miss Maria Parloa    SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR WALTER BAKER & Co. LTD.      PLAIN CHOCOLATE    For six people, use one quart of milk, two ounces of Walter Baker &  Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, one tablespoonful of cornstarch, three  tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of hot water.    Mix the cornstarch with one gill of the milk. Put the remainder of the  milk on to heat in the double-boiler. When the milk comes to the boiling  point, stir in the cornstarch and cook for ten minutes. Have the  chocolate cut in fine bits, and put it in a small iron or granite-ware  pan; add the sugar and water, and place the pan over a hot fire. Stir  constantly until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add this to the hot  milk, and beat the mixture with a whisk until it is frothy. Or, the  chocolate may be poured back and forth from the boiler to a pitcher,  holding high the vessel from which you pour. This will give a thick  froth. Serve at once.    If you prefer not to have the chocolate thick, omit the cornstarch. If  condensed milk is used, substitute water for the milk named above and  add three tablespoonfuls of condensed milk when the chocolate is added.      CHOCOLATE, VIENNA STYLE    Use four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Vanilla Chocolate, one quart of  milk, three tablespoonfuls of hot water, and one tablespoonful of sugar.    Cut the chocolate in fine bits. Put the milk on the stove in the  double-boiler, and when it has been heated to the boiling point, put the  chocolate, sugar and water in a small iron or granite-ware pan, and stir  over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Stir this mixture into the hot  milk, and beat well with a whisk. Serve at once, putting a tablespoonful  of whipped cream in each cup and then filling up with the chocolate.    The plain chocolate may be used instead of the vanilla, but in that case  use a teaspoonful of vanilla extract and three generous tablespoonfuls  of sugar instead of one.      BREAKFAST COCOA    Walter Baker & Co.'s Breakfast Cocoa is powdered so fine that it can be  dissolved by pouring boiling water on it. For this reason it is often  prepared at the table. A small teaspoonful of the powder is put in the  cup with a teaspoonful of sugar; on this is poured two-thirds of a cup  of boiling water, and milk or cream is added to suit the individual  taste. This is very convenient; but cocoa is not nearly so good when  prepared in this manner as when it is boiled.    For six cupfuls of cocoa use two tablespoonfuls of the powder, two  tablespoonfuls of sugar, half a pint of boiling water, and a pint and a  half of milk. Put the milk on the stove in the double-boiler. Put the  cocoa and sugar in a saucepan, and gradually pour the hot water upon  them, stirring all the time. Place the saucepan on the fire and stir  until the contents boil. Let this mixture boil for five minutes; then  add the boiling milk and serve.    A gill of cream is a great addition to this cocoa.    Scalded milk may be used in place of boiled milk, if preferred. For  flavoring, a few grains of salt and half a teaspoonful of vanilla  extract may be added.      CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE    Beat half a cupful of butter to a cream, and gradually beat into it one  cupful of sugar. When this is light, beat in half a cupful of milk, a  little at a time, and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat the whites of six  eggs to a stiff froth. Mix half a teaspoonful of baking powder with two  scant cupfuls of sifted flour. Stir the flour and whites of eggs  alternately into the mixture. Have three deep tin plates well buttered,  and spread two-thirds of the batter in two of them.    Into the remaining batter stir one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium  No. 1 Chocolate, melted, and spread this batter in the third plate. Bake  the cakes in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes. Put a layer of  white cake on a large plate, and spread with white icing. Put the dark  cake on this, and also spread with white icing. On this put the third  cake. Spread with chocolate icing.    TO MAKE THE ICING. Put into a granite-ware saucepan two gills of sugar  and one of water, and boil gently until bubbles begin to come from the  bottom--say, about five minutes. Take from the fire instantly. Do not  stir or shake the sugar while it is cooking. Pour the hot syrup in a  thin stream into the whites of two eggs that have been beaten to a stiff  froth, beating the mixture all the time. Continue to beat until the  icing is thick. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla. Use two-thirds  of this as a white icing, and to the remaining third add one ounce of  melted chocolate. To melt the chocolate, shave it fine and put in a cup,  which is then to be placed in a pan of boiling water.      CHOCOLATE CAKE    For two sheets of cake, use three ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium  No. 1 Chocolate, three eggs, one cupful and three-fourths of sifted  pastry flour, one cupful and three-fourths of sugar, half a cupful of  butter, half a cupful of milk, half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract,  one teaspoonful and a half of baking powder.    Grate the chocolate. Beat the butter to a cream, and gradually beat in  the sugar. Beat in the milk and vanilla, then the eggs (already well  beaten), next the chocolate, and finally the flour, in which the baking  powder should be mixed. Pour into two well buttered shallow cake pans.  Bake for twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. Frost or not, as you  like.      CHOCOLATE MARBLE CAKE    Put one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate and one tablespoonful of  butter in a cup, and set this in a pan of boiling water. Beat to a cream  half a cupful of butter and one cupful of sugar. Gradually beat in half  a cupful of milk. Now add the whites of six eggs beaten to a stiff  froth, one teaspoonful of vanilla, and a cupful and a half of sifted  flour, in which is mixed one teaspoonful of baking powder. Put about  one-third of this mixture into another bowl, and stir the melted butter  and chocolate into it.

While taking part  in football games, I frequently observed that  my team would be able to push the opposing  team halfway across the field. Then the  tables would be turned and my team would  give ground. At one moment one team would  seem to possess much superior physical  strength to the other; the next moment the  equilibrium would be changed apparently  without cause. Often, however, the weaker  team would rally in response to the captain's  coaching. On the field a player frequently  finds himself unable to exert himself. His  greatest effort is necessary to force himself to  work. In such a mental condition a vigorous  and enthusiastic appeal from the coach may  <p 10>  supply the needed stimulus and stir him to  sudden display of all his strength.    I recently conducted a series of experiments  on college athletes to determine  whether coaching could actually increase a  man's strength when he was already trying  his ``best,'' and whether he could continue  to work after he was ``completely exhausted.''  I put each man at work on machines which allowed  him to exert himself to his utmost and  measured his accomplishment. While he was  thus employed, the coach began urging him to  increase his exertion. Ordinarily the increase  was marked--sometimes as much as fifty  per cent.    Again, when the man had exhausted himself  without coaching, the extra demand would  be made on him; usually he was able to continue,  even though without the coaching he  had been unable to do any more. There was,  of course, a point of exhaustion at which the  coaching ceased to be effective.    _The tests proved conclusively that when a man  is doing what he believes to be his best, he is still_  <p 11>  _able to do better; when he is completely exhausted,  he is, under proper stimulus, able to continue_.    Before a horse is started in a race it is  vigorously exercised, ``warmed up.'' To the  uninitiated this process seems so strenuous  as to defeat its purpose by wearing out the  strength of the horse. Every horseman knows,  however, that the animal cannot attain top  speed till after it has undergone this severe  discipline.    In training for a contest an athlete usually  takes long runs. Soon after the start he feels  weary and exhausted, but, by disregarding this  feeling and continuing to run, a sudden change  comes over him commonly known as ``getting  his second wind.''    Thus the runner feels wave upon wave of  exhaustion followed by waves of invigoration.  Had he stopped when he first began to tire,  he never would have known of his wonderful  reserve fund of strength which can be drawn  upon only by passing through the feeling  of exhaustion. He seems to be able to tap  deeper and deeper reservoirs of strength.  <p 12>    _Many men have never discovered their reserve  stores of strength because they have formed the  fixed habit of quitting at the first access of weariness_.    Thus they never become conscious of the  wonderful resources which might be used if  they were willing to disregard the trifling  wave of weariness.    Our best energies are not on the surface  and are not available without great exertion.  We have to warm up and get our second wind  before we are capable of our best physical or  mental accomplishments. All our muscular  and psychical processes are dependent upon  the activity of the nervous system. This activity  seems to be at its best only after repeated  and vigorous stimulation and after  it has reached down to profound and widely  distributed centers.    _Most of us never know of our possible achievements  because we have never warmed up and  got our second wind in our business or professional  affairs_.    When an individual succeeds in tapping his  <p 13>  reserve energies, others marvel at the tremendous  tasks he accomplishes. They judge in  terms of superficial energy, and for such the  results would, of course, be impossible, even  though many of the admiring spectators could  actually equal or excel the deed.    Consider for a moment the work achieved  by Mr. Edward Payson Weston who recently  walked the entire distance from New York  to San Francisco without halt or rest in one  hundred and four days. Throughout the  entire journey Mr. Weston covered about  fifty miles daily, once attaining the remarkable  distance of eighty-seven miles in twenty-four  hours. Though Mr. Weston is seventy years  of age, at the close of the walk he seemed to be  relatively free from exhaustion and undaunted  in spirit.    The work accomplished by such men as  Gladstone and Roosevelt is incomprehensible  to most of us who have never undertaken  more than puny tasks. These men retain their  strength and in no way seem to be undermining  their health by the accomplishment of their  <p 14>  Herculean labors. Body and mind seem to  respond to the demands made upon them.  Their periods of sleep and their vacations  seem to be no more than the hours and days  of rest required by those of us who accomplish  infinitely less.    No need, however, to go beyond the field  of business or industry to find men whose  super-energy has carried them to epochial  discoveries or feats of organization. The  invention of the incandescent lamp by Edison  is said to have been accomplished, for instance,  only after forty-eight hours' continuous  concentration on the final problem of finding the  right carbon filament and determining the  proper degree of vacuum in the inclosing  bulb. Months of experiment and research  had gone before; eighteen hours a day in the  laboratory had been no uncommon thing for  the inventor and his assistants, but in the last  strenuous grapple with success his own physical  and mental powers were alone equal to the  strain. Not once during the two days and  nights did he rest or sleep or take his attention  <p 15>  from the successive tests which led up to the  assembling of the lamp which lights the world's  work and play.    The steel blade that is used seems to last as  long as the one which is allowed to lie idle.  The wearing out in the one case does not seem  to be more destructive than the rusting out  in the other.    We have a choice between wearing out and  rusting out. Most of us unwittingly have  chosen the rusting process.    This, indeed, may be said to be Edison's  regular method of work, as it is the method of  many other men who have accomplished great  things in science and industry. Both mind  and body have been trained and accustomed to  exertions which seem quite impossible to ordinary  individuals.    Many persons find that increased intellectual  activity results in less fatigue and  greater achievements. As a student I did  my best work and enjoyed it most the year  I carried the greatest number of courses and  assumed the most outside duties. In my  <p 16>  capacity as adviser to college students I find  many who are able to accomplish thirty per  cent more work than is expected of college  students but fail to do equally well the regular  amount. There are others who can carry the  regular amount but not more without injury  to their health.    College grades afford a means of recording  intellectual efficiency directed toward particular  problems. With no apparent change in  bodily conditions the same student frequently  increases his efficiency a hundred per cent.  The increase seldom has an injurious effect  on health, but is merely evidence of the fact  that he has suddenly wakened up and is  applying energies which before were undiscovered.  A slow walk for a single mile leaves  many persons ``dragged out'' and exhausted,  but a brisk walk of the same or a greater distance  results in invigoration and recuperation.  Likewise the droning over an intellectual task  results in exhaustion, while vigorous treatment  whets the appetite for additional problems.    This swift, decisive attack on problems was  <p 17>  the method of Edward H. Harriman, who  crowded into ten years the railroad achievements  of an extraordinary lifetime. Decisions  involving expenditure of many millions of  dollars were arrived at so quickly as to seem  off-hand, even reckless. In reality, they were  the products of brief periods of intense application  in which he reviewed all the conditions  and elements involved, and forged his conclusion,  as it were, at white heat. Back of each  decision was exact and thorough knowledge  of the physical and traffic conditions of each  of his railroads. In the case of the Union  Pacific, at least, he gained this mastery by  patient, intensive study of each grade and  curve and freight-producing town on its 1800  miles of track.    The inhabitant of the torrid zone upon  moving to a northern climate is severely  affected by the chill of the atmosphere. The  discomfort may last for days or months, but  he becomes acclimated and is able to withstand  the cold without serious discomfort. Likewise  the inhabitant of a cool climate feels exhausted  <p 18>  by the heat of the torrid zone. In some cases  he is unable to accustom himself to the change,  but in many instances the acclimatization  follows rapidly and leaves the individual well  fortified against the dangers of excessive heat.    Persons who have accustomed themselves  to stimulants of any sort are completely depleted  if they are unable to get the special  form to which they have been accustomed.  This holds true for tobacco, morphine, coffee,  and many other forms of stimulants actually  indulged in by many persons. If they are  able to resist the temptation and deny themselves  the stimulant, the period of exhaustion  soon disappears and the subject may even lose  all craving for that which formerly seemed  essential to his very existence.    The quantity which we eat is partly a  matter of habit. There is doubtless a minimum  of nourishment which is absolutely necessary  for health and strength. On the other  hand there is doubtless a maximum limit  which cannot be passed"]]]
