Never before was there such a  lenient barb on such a well-aimed arrow.    But if his business is not with the causes which contributed to the  character of English Society in his time, it is with their effects. No  satirist has ever put more highly representative figures on to his  stage. They are so highly representative because they conform so  strictly to type. He puts a valuation upon everyone whom he introduces  on his stage. He shows exactly the regard in which we are to hold them  and their profession. And it is interesting, in the light of the favour  with which he always treated the typical _savant_, to hear from his son  that he was always as much interested in what was being accomplished in  science as in anything else in the world. We must conclude scientists  were first in his estimation as men, from the pains he was at to give  them the appearance of distinction in his pictures. Then he had much  regard for Generals, great Admirals, and other magnificent specimens,  the Adonis, for instance, that figures almost as often, and nearly  always in company with, his charming woman. This gentleman is difficult  to describe. He seems too languid even for the profession of  man-about-town, but his clothes are such that one would think their  irreproachability could only be maintained by a life of dedication to  them. Did he ever exist? Du Maurier is very subtle here. He fully  appreciated the great aim of the public-school-trained man in his own  time--the elaborate care with which an officer studied to conceal an  enthusiasm for the profession of arms, the great air of indolence with  which over-work was concealed in the other fashionable professions. As a  matter of fact these beautiful priests in the temple of \"good form\" were  splendid stoics. They would lay it down that as long as correctness of  attitude was maintained nothing mattered.    The artist seems to share many of the prejudices of the older  aristocrats. He makes his Jews too Jewish. He believes that they produce  great artists, and as if this wasn't enough, he still holds them at  arm's length. We have in his art not only the record of social  innovations, but a picture of the aristocrats before the barbarian  invasion. As a picture of them then his art has now its value. And yet  he was not quite an aristocrat in temperament, which is a little  different from being one by birth. He would have been less tolerant of  the Philistines if he had been, and more Bohemian too. He made his great  excursions into Bohemia, but he reached it always by a journey through  the suburbs. His love of glamour and enchantment was aristocratic, but  he did not keep it to the end. He loses it in later drawings. His  satire, too, grows less pointed after the eighties, with an equivalent  decline in the art by which it is conveyed. The poetic vein that once  distinguished him from the Society he depicted tended also to disappear,  as he succumbed to a process of absorption into a Society which he had  once been able to observe with the freshness of a stranger. It is  familiarity that blunts our sense of beauty. It is in its last phase in  _Punch_ that his drawing loses the poetry that characterised it in the  seventies and eighties, and which gave his satire then such a potent  stealthy influence over those for whom it was intended.    [Illustration: Illustration for \"Recollections of an English Gold-Mine\"  _Once a Week_, 1861.]      Section 2      If it were possible to imagine a world without any women or children in  it, du Maurier's contemporary, Keene, so far as we can judge from his  art, would have got along very well in such a world. He would have  missed the voluminous skirt that followed the crinoline, with its  glorious opportunity for beautiful spacing of white in a drawing, more  than he would have missed its wearer. But du Maurier's art is Romantic;  in the background of its chivalric regard for women there is the history  of the worship of the Virgin. The source of such an art would have to be  sought for in the neighbourhood of Camelot. It is impossible to overlook  the chivalry that will not allow him, except with pain, to make a woman  ugly. He was first of all a Poet, and though it may be a man's business  to put a poem on to paper, it is a woman's to create it. He was a poet  put into the business of satire with sufficient wit to sustain himself  there. Many a time he has to make the satire rest almost entirely with  the legend at the foot of his drawing; by obscuring their legends we find  that drawing after drawing has nothing to tell us but of the beauty of  those involved in \"the joke,\" and this, as we shall show further on,  gives a peculiar salt, or rather sweetness, to satire from his pencil.  He is a romancer. His dialogues are romances. It is the novelist and  artist running side by side in the legend and the drawing, but almost  independently of each other, the wit and the poet in him trying to play  each other's game, that provides the contradictoriness--the charm in his  pictures. The point of the \"joke\" seems very often a mere excuse for  working off several incidents of beauty that have been perceived.    In dealing with _fashion_ du Maurier scores with posterity. Beauty, when  it really is recorded, is the one element in any transitory fashion that  survives the challenge of time. It is natural for one generation to hate  more than anything else in the world the fashions immediately preceding  the one affected. Pointed contemporary satire has, from the very shape  it must assume, an ephemeral success. It is only when something more  than the mere object of the satire is involved by some grace of the  satirist's genius--some response on his part to charm in the thing  assailed, that the work of satire comes down from its own time with an  indestructible ingredient in it.    As a record of feminine fashion du Maurier's drawings in _Punch_ are  remarkable. It must not be imagined that the history of fashion is  merely the tale of dressmakers' caprice. The very language of changing  ideals is the variation of the toilet. When women were restricted to an  oriental extent within convention, when to be \"prim\" was the aim of  life, no feature of dress was lacking that could put \"abandonment\" of  any but a moral kind, out of the question. A shake of the head too  quickly and the coiffure was imperilled; the movements that came within  the prescribed circle of dignity within the circle of the crinoline were  all of a rhythmical order. Women did not take to moving with freedom  because the crinoline went out, but the crinoline went out when they  took to moving with freedom. It went out simply because it was a  confounded nuisance. It was a natural costume only as long as women  imagined it was natural to them to be very still in demeanour. Once they  began to have opinions about that matter they soon sent the crinoline on  its way. The same process goes on with the fashions of wearing the  hair. The Blue-stocking, constantly running her nervous fingers up her  forehead into her hair, has given to Girton a style of its own,  equivalent to none at all. _Fashion_ is more sensible than most things.  If it changes with a rapidity that dazzles man, is not that only because  man is stupid?    To study hair-dressing in du Maurier's pictures, is to study the growth  of the nineteenth-century woman's mind. The head-dress becomes more  natural as woman herself becomes more natural. It becomes more Greek  when she takes up the Amazon idea, and simple when she discards some of  the complications of convention, always to return to elaboration in the  winter when it is not easy to live the simple life after the bell goes  for dinner.    When the crinoline went out the train came in; so that though woman had  allowed _herself_ more freedom, man could only walk behind her at a  respectful distance with a ceremonial measure of pace. The dressmaker  did not control all this; the resources of her transcendent art were  strained to keep up with the march of womanhood--that was all. If we may  believe du Maurier's art, the note of beauty never entirely disappeared  from _fashion_ until the aesthetic women of the eighties seemed to take  in hand their own clothes. The aesthetic ladies failed, as the movement  to which they attached themselves did, for beauty is something attendant  upon life, arriving when it likes, going away very often when everyone  is on his knees for it to remain.    [Illustration]      Section 3    When it comes to his drawings of children du Maurier is very far away  from the sentimentalist of the Barrie school. He does not attempt to go  through the artifice of pretended possession of the realm of the child's  mind. He was of those who find the curious attractiveness of childhood  in the unreality, and not, as claimed by the later school, the superior  reality of the child's world. His view of the child is the affectionate,  but the \"Olympian\" one, with its amused appreciation of the _naivete_  and the charm of childhood's particular brand of self-possession. It is  possible that his nursery scenes played some part in promoting the  respect that is given to-day to the impulses of childhood, the  enlightened and beautiful side of which respect after all so far  outweighs the ridiculous and sentimental one. His nursery drawings  contribute much of the fragrance associated with his work in _Punch_. He  takes rank under the best definition of an artist, namely, one who can  put his own values upon the things that come up for representation on  his paper. By his insistence upon certain pleasant things he helped to  establish them in the ideal, which, on the morrow, always tends to  become the real. He was a realist only to the extent of their  possibility. It gave him no pleasure whatever to enumerate, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#2)"],[1,"ohl-      pots--Pottery--Clay--Glazes--Red and Painted Wares--Ushabtiu--Funerary      Cones--Painted Vases--\"Canopic\" Vases--Clay Sarcophagi--Glass--Its      Chemical Constituents--Clear Glass--Coloured Glass--Imitations of      Precious Stones in Glass--Glass Mosaics--Miniature Objects in Coloured      Glass--Glass Amulets--Coloured Glass Vases--Enamels--The Theban Blue--      The Enamels of Tell el Amarna--Enamelled Ushabtiu of Amen Ptahmes--      Enamelled Tiles of the Step Pyramid at Sakkarah--Enamelled Tiles of      Tell el Yahudeh        Sec. 2.
