[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#2)"],[1," Duke of Cumberland was probably the most unpopular man in  England. Hideously ugly, with a distorted eye, he was bad-tempered  and vindictive in private, a violent reactionary in politics, and was  subsequently suspected of murdering his valet and of having carried  on an amorous intrigue of an extremely scandalous kind. He had lately  married a German Princess, but there were as yet no children by the  marriage. The Duke of Sussex had mildly literary tastes and collected  books. He had married Lady Augusta Murray, by whom he had two children,  but the marriage, under the Royal Marriages Act, was declared void. On  Lady Augusta's death, he married Lady Cecilia Buggin; she changed her  name to Underwood, but this marriage also was void. Of the Duke of  Cambridge, the youngest of the brothers, not very much was known. He  lived in Hanover, wore a blonde wig, chattered and fidgeted a great  deal, and was unmarried.    Besides his seven sons, George III had five surviving daughters. Of  these, two--the Queen of Wurtemberg and the Duchess of Gloucester--were  married and childless. The three unmarried princesses--Augusta,  Elizabeth, and Sophia--were all over forty.    III    The fourth son of George III was Edward, Duke of Kent. He was now fifty  years of age--a tall, stout, vigorous man, highly-coloured, with bushy  eyebrows, a bald top to his head, and what hair he had carefully dyed a  glossy black. His dress was extremely neat, and in his whole appearance  there was a rigidity which did not belie his character. He had spent  his early life in the army--at Gibraltar, in Canada, in the West  Indies--and, under the influence of military training, had become at  first a disciplinarian and at last a martinet. In 1802, having been sent  to Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison, he was recalled  for undue severity, and his active career had come to an end. Since then  he had spent his life regulating his domestic arrangements with great  exactitude, busying himself with the affairs of his numerous dependents,  designing clocks, and struggling to restore order to his finances, for,  in spite of his being, as someone said who knew him well \"regle comme du  papier a musique,\" and in spite of an income of L24,000 a year, he  was hopelessly in debt. He had quarrelled with most of his brothers,  particularly with the Prince Regent, and it was only natural that he  should have joined the political Opposition and become a pillar of the  Whigs.    What his political opinions may actually have been is open to doubt; it  has often been asserted that he was a Liberal, or even a Radical; and,  if we are to believe Robert Owen, he was a necessitarian Socialist. His  relations with Owen--the shrewd, gullible, high-minded, wrong-headed,  illustrious and preposterous father of Socialism and Co-operation--were  curious and characteristic. He talked of visiting the Mills at New  Lanark, he did, in fact, preside at one of Owen's public meetings;  he corresponded with him on confidential terms, and he even (so Owen  assures us) returned, after his death, from \"the sphere of spirits\" to  give encouragement to the Owenites on earth. \"In an especial manner,\"  says Owen, \"I have to name the very anxious feelings of the spirit of  his Royal Highness the Late Duke of Kent (who early informed me  that there were no titles in the spititual spheres into which he had  entered), to benefit, not a class, a sect, a party, or any particular  country, but the whole of the human race, through futurity.\" \"His whole  spirit-proceeding with me has been most beautiful,\" Owen adds, \"making  his own appointments; and never in one instance has this spirit not  been punctual to the minute he had named.\" But Owen was of a sanguine  temperament. He also numbered among his proselytes President Jefferson,  Prince Metternich, and Napoleon; so that some uncertainty must still  linger over the Duke of Kent's views. But there is no uncertainty about  another circumstance: his Royal Highness borrowed from Robert Owen, on  various occasions, various sums of money which were never repaid and  amounted in all to several hundred pounds.    After the death of the Princess Charlotte it was clearly important, for  more than one reason, that the Duke of Kent should marry. From the point  of view of the nation, the lack of heirs in the reigning family seemed  to make the step almost obligatory; it was also likely to be highly  expedient from the point of view of the Duke. To marry as a public  duty, for the sake of the royal succession, would surely deserve some  recognition from a grateful country. When the Duke of York had married  he had received a settlement of L25,000 a year. Why should not the Duke  of Kent look forward to an equal sum? But the situation was not quite  simple. There was the Duke of Clarence to be considered; he was the  elder brother, and, if HE married, would clearly have the prior claim.  On the other hand, if the Duke of Kent married, it was important  to remember that he would be making a serious sacrifice: a lady was  involved.    The Duke, reflecting upon all these matters with careful attention,  happened, about a month after his niece's death, to visit Brussels, and  learnt that Mr. Creevey was staying in the town. Mr. Creevey was a close  friend of the leading Whigs and an inveterate gossip; and it occurred  to the Duke that there could be no better channel through which to  communicate his views upon the situation to political circles at home.  Apparently it did not occur to him that Mr. Creevey was malicious and  might keep a diary. He therefore sent for him on some trivial pretext,  and a remarkable conversation ensued.    After referring to the death of the Princess, to the improbability of  the Regent's seeking a divorce, to the childlessness of the Duke of  York, and to the possibility of the Duke of Clarence marrying, the Duke  adverted to his own position. \"Should the Duke of Clarence not marry,\"  he said, \"the next prince in succession is myself, and although I trust  I shall be at all times ready to obey any call my country may make upon  me, God only knows the sacrifice it will be to make, whenever I shall  think it my duty to become a married man. It is now seven and twenty  years that Madame St. Laurent and I have lived together: we are of  the same age, and have been in all climates, and in all difficulties  together, and you may well imagine, Mr. Creevey, the pang it will  occasion me to part with her. I put it to your own feelings--in the  event of any separation between you and Mrs. Creevey... As for Madame  St. Laurent herself, I protest I don't know what is to become of her if  a marriage is to be forced upon me; her feelings are already so agitated  upon the subject.\" The Duke went on to describe how, one morning, a day  or two after the Princess Charlotte's death, a paragraph had appeared in  the Morning Chronicle, alluding to the possibility of his marriage. He  had received the newspaper at breakfast together with his letters, and  \"I did as is my constant practice, I threw the newspaper across the  table to Madame St. Laurent, and began to open and read my letters. I  had not done so but a very short time, when my attention was called to  an extraordinary noise and a strong convulsive movement in Madame St.  Laurent's throat. For a short time I entertained serious apprehensions  for her safety; and when, upon her recovery, I enquired into the  occasion of this attack, she pointed to the article in the Morning  Chronicle.\"    The Duke then returned to the subject of the Duke of Clarence. \"My  brother the Duke of Clarence is the elder brother, and has certainly the  right to marry if he chooses, and I would not interfere with him on any  account. If he wishes to be king--to be married and have children, poor  man--God help him! Let him do so. For myself--I am a man of no ambition,  and wish only to remain as I am... Easter, you know, falls very early  this year--the 22nd of March. If the Duke of Clarence does not take any  step before that time, I must find some pretext to reconcile Madame St.  Laurent to my going to England for a short time. When once there, it  will be easy for me to consult with my friends as to the proper steps to  be taken. Should the Duke of Clarence do nothing before that time as to  marrying it will become my duty, no doubt, to take some measures upon  the subject myself.\" Two names, the Duke said, had been mentioned in  this connection--those of the Princess of Baden and the Princess of  Saxe-Coburg. The latter, he thought, would perhaps be the better of the  two, from the circumstance of Prince Leopold being so popular with the  nation; but before any other steps were taken, he hoped and expected to  see justice done to Madame St. Laurent. \"She is,\" he explained, \"of very  good family, and has never been an actress, and I am the first and only  person who ever lived with her. Her disinterestedness, too, has been  equal to her fidelity. When she first came to me it was upon L100 a  year. That sum was afterwards raised to L400 and finally to L1000; but  when my debts made it necessary for me to sacrifice a great part of my  income, Madame St. Laurent insisted upon again returning to her income  of L400 a year. If Madame St. Laurent is to return to live amongst her  friends, it must be in such a state of independence as to command their  respect. I shall not require very much, but a certain number of servants  and a carriage are essentials.\" As to his own settlement, the Duke  observed that he would expect the Duke of York's marriage to be  considered the precedent. \"That,\" he said, \"was a marriage for the  succession, and L25,000 for income was settled, in addition to all his  other income, purely on that account. I shall be contented with the same  arrangement, without making any demands grounded on the difference of  the value of money in 1792 and at present. As for the payment of my  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12655"],[0,"The Boy Mechanic, Volume 1: 700 Things for Boys to Do (#2)"],[1,"long strip of cloth to the folded tube  and weave it alternately in and out, having each    [Illustration: Fig. 1, Fig. 2; Inner Tube and Cover]    run of the cloth about 4 in. apart, until it is bound as shown in  Fig. 1.

A  boomerang club will help to fill in between and also furnishes  good exercise for the muscles of the arm. A boomerang can be made    [Illustration: Bending and Cutting the Wood]    of a piece of well seasoned hickory plank. The plank is well  steamed in a wash boiler or other large kettle and then bent to a  nice curve, as shown in Fig. 1. It is held in this curve until  dry, with two pieces nailed on the sides as shown.    After the piece is thoroughly dried out, remove the side pieces  and cut it into sections with a saw, as shown in Fig. 2. The  pieces are then dressed round. A piece of plank 12 in. wide and 2  ft. long will make six boomerangs.    To throw a boomerang, grasp it and hold the same as a club, with  the hollow side away from you. Practice first at some object about  25 ft. distant, and in a short time the thrower will be able to  hit the mark over 100 ft. away. Any worker in wood can turn out a  great number of boomerangs cheaply.  --Contributed by J. E. Noble, Toronto, Ontario.        ** How to Make an Eskimo Snow House [5]  By GEORGE E. WALSH    Playing in the snow can be raised to a fine art if boys and girls  will build their creations with some attempt at architectural  skill and not content themselves with mere rough work. Working in  snow and ice opens a wide field for an expression of taste and  invention, but the construction of houses and forts out of this  plastic material provides the greatest amount of pleasure to the  normally healthy boy or girl.    The snow house of the Eskimo is probably the unhealthiest of  buildings made by any savage to live in, but it makes an excellent  playhouse in winter, and represents at the same time a most  ingenious employment of the arch system in building. The Eskimos  build their snow houses without the aid of any scaffolding or  interior false work, and while there is a keystone at the top of  the dome, it is not essential to the support of the walls. These  are self-supporting from the time the first snow blocks are put  down until the last course is laid.    The snow house is of the beehive shape and the ground plan is that  of a circle. The circle is first laid out on the ground and a  space cleared for it. Then a row of snow blocks is laid on the  ground and another course of similar blocks placed on top. The  snow blocks are not exactly square in shape, but about 12 in.  long, 6 in. high and 4 or 5 in. thick. Larger or smaller blocks  can be used, according to size of the house and thickness of the  walls.    First, the snow blocks must be packed and pressed firmly into  position out of moist snow that will pack. A very light, dry snow  will not pack easily, and it may be necessary to use a little  water. If the snow is of the right consistency, there will be no  trouble in packing and working with it. As most of the blocks are  to be of the same size throughout, it will pay to make a mold for  them by forming a box of old boards nailed together, minus the  top, and with a movable bottom, or rather no bottom at all. Place  the four sided box on a flat board and ram snow in it, forcing it  down closely. Then by lifting the box up and tapping the box from  above, the block will drop out. In this way blocks of uniform size  are formed, which makes the building simpler and easier.    While one boy makes the blocks another can shave them off at the  edges and two others can build the house, one inside of the circle  and the other outside. The Eskimos build their snow houses in this  way, and the man inside stays there until he is completely walled  in. Then the door and a window are cut through the wall.    [Illustration: Laying the Snow Bricks]    [Illustration: Three-Room Snow House]    Each layer of snow blocks must have a slight slant at the top  toward the center so that the walls will constantly curve inward.  This slant at the top is obtained better by slicing off the lower  surfaces of each block before putting it in its course. The top  will then have a uniform inward slant.    The first course of the snow house should be thicker than the  others, and the thickness of the walls gradually decreases toward  the top. A wall, however, made of 6-in. blocks throughout will  hold up a snow house perfectly, if its top is no more than 6 or 7  ft. above the ground. If a higher house is needed the walls should  be thicker at the base and well up toward the middle.    The builder has no mortar for binding the blocks together, and  therefore he must make his joints smooth and even and force in  loose snow to fill up the crevices. A little experience will  enable one to do this work well, and the construction of the house  will proceed rapidly. The Eskimos build additions to their houses  by adding various dome-shaped structures to one side, and the  young architect can imitate them. Such dome-shaped structures are  shown in one of the illustrations.    A fact not well understood and appreciated is that the Eskimo  beehive snow house represents true arch building. It requires no  scaffolding in building and it exerts no outward thrust. In the  ordinary keystone arch used by builders, a, temporary structure  must be erected to hold the walls up until the keystone is fitted  in position, and the base must be buttressed against an outward  thrust. The Eskimo does not have to consider these points. There  is no outward thrust, and the top keystone is not necessary to  hold the structure up. It is doubtful whether such an arch could  be built of brick or stone without scaffolding, but with the snow  blocks it is a simple matter.        ** Secret Door Lock [6]    The sketch shows the construction of a lock I have on a door which  is quite a mystery to those who do not know how it operates. It  also keeps them out. The parts of the lock on the inside of the  door are shown in Fig. 1. These parts can be covered so that no  one can see them.    [Illustration: Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3; The Lock Parts]    The ordinary latch and catch A are attached to the door in the  usual manner. The latch is lifted with a stick of wood B, which is  about 1 ft. long and 1 in. wide, and pivoted about two-thirds of  the way from the top as shown. The latch A is connected to the  stick B with a strong cord run through a staple to secure a  right-angle pull between the pieces. A nail, C, keeps the stick B  from falling over to the left. The piece of wood, D, is 6 or 8 in.  long and attached to a bolt that runs through the door, the  opposite end being fastened to the combination dial. Two kinds of  dials are shown in Fig. 2. The piece D is fastened on the bolt an  inch or two from the surface of the door to permit placing a  spiral spring of medium strength in between as shown in Fig. 3.  The opposite end of the bolt may be screwed into the dial, which  can be made of wood, or an old safe dial will do. A nail is driven  through the outer end of the piece D and the end cut off so that  it will pass over the piece B when the dial is turned. When the  dial is pulled out slightly and then turned toward the right, the  nail will catch on the piece B and open the latch. --Contributed  by Geo. Goodbrod, Union, Ore.        ** A Convenient Hot-Dish Holder [7]    When taking hot dishes from the stove, it is very convenient to  have holders handy for use. For this purpose I screwed two screw  eyes into the ceiling, one in front of the stove directly above  the place where the holder should hang, and the other back of the  stove and out of the way. I next ran a strong cord through the two  eyes. To one end of the cord I attached a weight made of a clean  lump of coal. The cord is just long enough to let the weight hang  a few inches above the floor and pass through both screw eyes. I  fastened a small ring to the other end to keep the cord from  slipping back by the pull of the weight. I then fastened two  pieces of string to the ring at the end of the cord and attached  an iron holder to the end of each string. The strings should be  just long enough to keep the holders just over the stove where  they are always    [Illustration: Holders in a Convenient Place]    ready for use, as the weight always draws them back to place.  --Contributed by R. S. Merrill, Syracuse, New York.        ** Magic-Box Escape [7]    The things required to make this trick are a heavy packing box  with cover, one pair of special hinges, one or two hasps for as  many padlocks and a small buttonhook, says the Sphinx.    The hinges must be the kind for attaching inside of the box. If  ordinary butts are used, the cover of the box    [Illustration: Box with Hinges and Lock]    must be cut as much short as the thickness of the end board. The  hinges should have pins that will slip easily through the parts.    Before entering the box the performer conceals the buttonhook on  his person, and as soon as the cover is closed and locked, and the  box placed in a cabinet or behind a screen, he pushes the pin or  bolt of the hinge out far enough to engage the knob end with the  buttonhook which is used to pull the pin from the hinge. Both  hinges are treated in this manner and the cover pushed up,  allowing the "]]]
