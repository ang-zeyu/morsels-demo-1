It teaches him to understand it and live it better than he did, and  in many cases it gives back to him, on a higher and more intelligent level,  the faith in it which he had previously all but lost.    Theosophy has its aspects as a science also; it is in very truth a science  of life, a science of the soul. It applies to everything the scientific  method of oft-repeated, painstaking observation, and then tabulates the  results and makes deductions from them. In this way it has investigated the  various planes of Nature, the conditions of man's consciousness during life  and after what is commonly called death. It cannot be too often repeated  that its statements on all these matters are not vague guesses or tenets of  faith, but are based upon direct and oft-repeated _observation_ of what  happens. Its investigators have dealt also to a certain extent with  subjects more in the range of ordinary science, as may be seen by those who  read the book on _Occult Chemistry_.    Thus we see that Theosophy combines within itself some of the  characteristics of philosophy, religion and science. What, it might be  asked, is its gospel for this weary world? What are the main points which  emerge from its investigations? What are the great facts which it has to  lay before humanity?    They have been well summed up under three main heads.    \"There are three truths which are absolute, and which cannot be lost, but  yet may remain silent for lack of speech.    \"The soul of man is immortal and its future is the future of a thing whose  growth and splendour has no limit.    \"The principle which gives life dwells in us and without us, is undying and  eternally beneficent, is not heard or seen or smelt, but is perceived by  the man who desires perception.    \"Each man is his own absolute lawgiver, the dispenser of glory or gloom to  himself, the decreer of his life, his reward, his punishment.    \"These truths, which are as great as is life itself, are as simple as the  simplest mind of man.\"    Put shortly, and in the language of the man of the street, this means that  God is good, that man is immortal, and that as we sow so we must reap.  There is a definite scheme of things; it is under intelligent direction and  works under immutable laws. Man has his place in this scheme and is living  under these laws. If he understands them and co-operates with them, he will  advance rapidly and will be happy; if he does not understand them--if,  wittingly or unwittingly, he breaks them, he will delay his progress and be  miserable. These are not theories, but proved facts. Let him who doubts  read on, and he will see.          Chapter II    FROM THE ABSOLUTE TO MAN      Of the Absolute, the Infinite, the All-embracing, we can at our present  stage know nothing, except that It is; we can say nothing that is not a  limitation, and therefore inaccurate.    In It are innumerable universes; in each universe countless solar systems.  Each solar system is the expression of a mighty Being, whom we call the  LOGOS, the Word of God, the Solar Deity. He is to it all that men mean by  God. He permeates it; there is nothing in it which is not He; it is the  manifestation of Him in such matter as we can see. Yet He exists above it  and outside it, living a stupendous life of His own among His Peers. As is  said in an Eastern Scripture: \"Having permeated this whole universe with  one fragment of Myself I remain.\"    Of that higher life of His we can know nothing. But of the fragment of His  life which energises His system we may know something in the lower levels  of its manifestation. We may not see Him, but we may see His power at work.  No one who is clairvoyant can be atheistic; the evidence is too tremendous.    Out of Himself He has called this mighty system into being. We who are in  it are evolving fragments of His life, Sparks of His divine Fire; from Him  we all have come; into Him we shall all return.    Many have asked why He has done this; why He has emanated from Himself all  this system; why He has sent us forth to face the storms of life. We cannot  know, nor is the question practical; suffice it that we are here, and we  must do our best. Yet many philosophers have speculated on this point and  many suggestions have been made. The most beautiful that I know is that of  a Gnostic philosopher:    \"God is Love, but Love itself cannot be perfect unless it has those upon  whom it can be lavished and by whom it can be returned. Therefore He put  forth of Himself into matter, and He limited His glory, in order that  through this natural and slow process of evolution we might come into  being; and we in turn according to His Will are to develop until we reach  even His own level, and then the very love of God itself will become more  perfect, because it will then be lavished on those, His own children, who  will fully understand and return it, and so His great scheme will be  realized and His Will, be done.\"    At what stupendous elevation His consciousness abides we know not, nor can  we know its true nature as it shows itself there. But when He puts Himself  down into such conditions as are within our reach, His manifestation is  ever threefold, and so all religions have imaged Him as a Trinity. Three,  yet fundamentally One; Three Persons (for person means a mask) yet one God,  showing Himself in those Three Aspects. Three to us, looking at Them from  below, because Their functions are different; one to Him, because He knows  Them to be but facets of Himself.    All Three of these Aspects are concerned in the evolution of the solar  system; all Three are also concerned in the evolution of man. This  evolution is His Will; the method of it is His plan.    Next below this Solar Deity, yet also in some mysterious manner part of  Him, come His seven Ministers sometimes called the Planetary Spirits. Using  an analogy drawn from the physiology of our own body, Their relation to Him  is like that of the ganglia or the nerve centres to the brain. All  evolution which comes forth from Him comes through one or other of Them.    Under Them in turn come vast hosts or orders of spiritual beings, whom we  call angels or devas. We do not yet know all the functions which they  fulfil in different parts of this wonderful scheme, but we find some of  them intimately connected with the building of the system and the unfolding  of life within it.    Here in our world there is a great Official who represents the Solar Deity  and is in absolute control of all the evolution that takes place upon this  planet. We may image Him as the true KING of this world and under Him are  ministers in charge of different departments. One of these departments is  concerned with the evolution of the different races of humanity so that for  each great race there is a Head who founds it, differentiates it from all  others, and watches over its development. Another department is that of  religion and education, and it is from this that all the greatest teachers  of history have come--that all religions have been sent forth. The great  Official at the head of this department either comes Himself or sends one  of His pupils to found a new religion when He decides that one is needed.    Therefore all religions, at the time of their first presentation to the  world, have contained a definite statement of the Truth, and in its  fundamentals this Truth has been always the same. The presentations of it  have varied because of differences in the races to whom it was offered. The  conditions of civilization and the degree of evolution obtained by various  races have made it desirable to present this one Truth in divers forms. But  the inner Truth is always the same, and the source from which it comes is  the same, even though the external phases may appear to be different and  even contradictory. It is foolish for men to wrangle over the question of  the superiority of one teacher or one form of teaching to another, for the  teacher is always one sent by the Great Brotherhood of Adepts, and in all  its important points, in its ethical and moral principles, the teaching has  always been the same.    There is in the world a body or Truth which lies at the back of all these  religions, and represents the facts of nature as far as they are at present  known to man. In the outer world, because of their ignorance of this,  people are always disputing and arguing about whether there is a God;  whether man survives death; whether definite progress is possible for him,  and what is his relation to the universe. These questions are ever present  in the mind of man as soon as intelligence is awakened. They are not  unanswerable, as is frequently supposed; the answers to them are within the  reach of anyone who will make proper efforts to find them. The truth is  obtainable, and the conditions of its attainment are possible of  achievement by anyone who will make the effort.    In the earlier stages of the development of humanity the great Officials of  the Hierarchy are provided from outside, from other and more highly evolved  parts of the system, but as soon as men can be trained to the necessary  level of power and wisdom these offices are held by them. In order to be  fit to hold such an office a man must raise himself to a very high level,  and must become what is called an Adept--a being of goodness, power and  wisdom so great that He towers above the rest of humanity, for He has  already attained the summit of ordinary human evolution; He has achieved  that which the plan of the Deity marked out for Him to achieve during this  age or dispensation. But His evolution later on continues beyond that  level--continues to divinity.    A large number of men have attained the Adept level--men not of one nation,  but of all the leading nations of the world--rare souls who with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"plains.
