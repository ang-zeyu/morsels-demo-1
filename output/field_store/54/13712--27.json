One morning the ship band which every Sunday had sounded the Choral of  Luther, awoke those sleeping in the first-class cabins with the most  unheard-of serenade. Desnoyers rubbed his eyes believing himself  under the hallucinations of a dream. The German horns were playing the  Marseillaise through the corridors and decks. The steward, smiling at  his astonishment, said, \"The fourteenth of July!\" On the German steamers  they celebrate as their own the great festivals of all the nations  represented by their cargo and passengers. Their captains are careful  to observe scrupulously the rites of this religion of the flag and its  historic commemoration. The most insignificant republic saw the ship  decked in its honor, affording one more diversion to help combat the  monotony of the voyage and further the lofty ends of the Germanic  propaganda. For the first time the great festival of France was being  celebrated on a German vessel, and whilst the musicians continued  escorting a racy Marseillaise in double quick time through the different  floors, the morning groups were commenting on the event.    \"What finesse!\" exclaimed the South American ladies. \"These Germans are  not so phlegmatic as they seem. It is an attention . . . something very  distinguished. . . . And is it possible that some still believe that  they and the French might come to blows?\"    The very few Frenchmen who were travelling on the steamer found  themselves admired as though they had increased immeasurably in public  esteem. There were only three;--an old jeweller who had been visiting  his branch shops in America, and two demi-mondaines from the rue de  la Paix, the most timid and well-behaved persons aboard, vestals with  bright eyes and disdainful noses who held themselves stiffly aloof in  this uncongenial atmosphere.    At night there was a gala banquet in the dining room at the end of which  the French flag and that of the Empire formed a flaunting, conspicuous  drapery. All the German passengers were in dress suits, and their wives  were wearing low-necked gowns. The uniforms of the attendants were as  resplendent as on a day of a grand review.    During dessert the tapping of a knife upon a glass reduced the table  to sudden silence. The Commandant was going to speak. And this brave  mariner who united to his nautical functions the obligation of making  harangues at banquets and opening the dance with the lady of most  importance, began unrolling a string of words like the noise of clappers  between long intervals of silence. Desnoyers knew a little German as  a souvenir of a visit to some relatives in Berlin, and so was able  to catch a few words. The Commandant was repeating every few minutes  \"peace\" and \"friends.\" A table neighbor, a commercial commissioner,  offered his services as interpreter to Julio, with that obsequiousness  which lives on advertisement.    \"The Commandant asks God to maintain peace between Germany and France  and hopes that the two peoples will become increasingly friendly.\"    Another orator arose at the same table. He was the most influential of  the German passengers, a rich manufacturer from Dusseldorf who had just  been visiting his agents in America. He was never mentioned by name. He  bore the title of Commercial Counsellor, and among his countrymen was  always Herr Comerzienrath and his wife was entitled Frau Rath. The  Counsellor's Lady, much younger than her important husband, had from  the first attracted the attention of Desnoyers. She, too, had made an  exception in favor of this young Argentinian, abdicating her title from  their first conversation. \"Call me Bertha,\" she said as condescendingly  as a duchess of Versailles might have spoken to a handsome abbot seated  at her feet. Her husband, also protested upon hearing Desnoyers call him  \"Counsellor,\" like his compatriots.    \"My friends,\" he said, \"call me 'Captain.' I command a company of the  Landsturm.\" And the air with which the manufacturer accompanied these  words, revealed the melancholy of an unappreciated man scorning the  honors he has in order to think only of those he does not possess.    While he was delivering his discourse, Julio was examining his small  head and thick neck which gave him a certain resemblance to a bull dog.  In imagination he saw the high and oppressive collar of a uniform making  a double roll of fat above its stiff edge. The waxed, upright moustaches  were bristling aggressively. His voice was sharp and dry as though  he were shaking out his words. . . . Thus the Emperor would utter his  harangues, so the martial burgher, with instinctive imitation, was  contracting his left arm, supporting his hand upon the hilt of an  invisible sword.    In spite of his fierce and oratorical gesture of command, all the  listening Germans laughed uproariously at his first words, like men who  knew how to appreciate the sacrifice of a Herr Comerzienrath when he  deigns to divert a festivity.    \"He is saying very witty things about the French,\" volunteered the  interpreter in a low voice, \"but they are not offensive.\"    Julio had guessed as much upon hearing repeatedly the word Franzosen.  He almost understood what the orator was saying--\"Franzosen--great  children, light-hearted, amusing, improvident. The things that they  might do together if they would only forget past grudges!\" The attentive  Germans were no longer laughing. The Counsellor was laying aside his  irony, that grandiloquent, crushing irony, weighing many tons, as  enormous as a ship. Then he began unrolling the serious part of his  harangue, so that he himself, was also greatly affected.    \"He says, sir,\" reported Julio's neighbor, \"that he wishes France  to become a very great nation so that some day we may march together  against other enemies . . . against OTHERS!\"    And he winked one eye, smiling maliciously with that smile of common  intelligence which this allusion to the mysterious enemy always  awakened.    Finally the Captain-Counsellor raised his glass in a toast to France.  \"Hoch!\" he yelled as though he were commanding an evolution of his  soldierly Reserves. Three times he sounded the cry and all the German  contingent springing to their feet, responded with a lusty Hoch while  the band in the corridor blared forth the Marseillaise.    Desnoyers was greatly moved. Thrills of enthusiasm were coursing up  and down his spine. His eyes became so moist that, when drinking his  champagne, he almost believed that he had swallowed some tears. He  bore a French name. He had French blood in his veins, and this that the  gringoes were doing--although generally they seemed to him ridiculous  and ordinary--was really worth acknowledging. The subjects of the Kaiser  celebrating the great date of the Revolution! He believed that he was  witnessing a great historic event.    \"Very well done!\" he said to the other South Americans at the near  tables. \"We must admit that they have done the handsome thing.\"    Then with the vehemence of his twenty-seven years, he accosted the  jeweller in the passage way, reproaching him for his silence. He was  the only French citizen aboard. He should have made a few words of  acknowledgment. The fiesta was ending awkwardly through his fault.    \"And why have you not spoken as a son of France?\" retorted the jeweller.    \"I am an Argentinian citizen,\" replied Julio.    And he left the older man believing that he ought to have spoken and  making explanations to those around him. It was a very dangerous thing,  he protested, to meddle in diplomatic affairs. Furthermore, he had not  instructions from his government. And for a few hours he believed that  he had been on the point of playing a great role in history.    Desnoyers passed the rest of the evening in the smoking room attracted  thither by the presence of the Counsellor's Lady. The Captain of the  Landsturm, sticking a preposterous cigar between his moustachios, was  playing poker with his countrymen ranking next to him in dignity and  riches. His wife stayed beside him most of the time, watching the goings  and comings of the stewards carrying great bocks, without daring to  share in this tremendous consumption of beer. Her special preoccupation  was to keep vacant near her a seat which Desnoyers might occupy. She  considered him the most distinguished man on board because he was  accustomed to taking champagne with all his meals. He was of medium  height, a decided brunette, with a small foot, which obliged her to tuck  hers under her skirts, and a triangular face under two masses of hair,  straight, black and glossy as lacquer, the very opposite of the type of  men about her. Besides, he was living in Paris, in the city which she  had never seen after numerous trips in both hemispheres.    \"Oh, Paris! Paris!\" she sighed, opening her eyes and pursing her lips  in order to express her admiration when she was speaking alone to the  Argentinian. \"How I should love to go there!\"    And in order that he might feel free to tell her things about Paris, she  permitted herself certain confidences about the pleasures of Berlin, but  with a blushing modesty, admitting in advance that in the world there  was more--much more--that she wished to become acquainted with.    While pacing around the Chapelle Expiatoire, Julio recalled with a  certain remorse the wife of Counsellor Erckmann. He who had made the  trip to America for a woman's sake, in order to collect money and marry  her! Then he immediately began making excuses for his conduct. Nobody  was going to know. Furthermore he did not pretend to be an ascetic, and  Bertha Erckmann was certainly a tempting adventure in mid ocean. Upon  recalling her, his imagination always saw a race horse--large, spare,  roan colored, and with a long stride. She was an up-to-date German who  admitted no defect in her country except the excessive weight of its  women, combating in her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14866"],[0,"Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#2)"],[1," other kinds of food, sometimes with unfortunate results. And then  there are the several special difficulties connected with Labrador.  There are three British governments concerned--Newfoundland, the  Dominion and the province of Quebec. There are French and American  fishermen along the shore. The proper protection of some migratory  species will require co-operation with the United States, perhaps with  Mexico and South America for certain birds, and even with Denmark for  the Greenland seal. Then, there are the Indians, the whole trade in  animal products, the necessity of not interfering with any legitimate  development, and the question of immediate expense, however small, for  a deferred benefit, however great and near at hand. And, finally, we  must remember that scientific knowledge is not by any means adequate  to deal with all the factors of the problem at once.      LABRADOR    But in spite of all these and many other difficulties, I firmly  believe that Labrador is by far the best country in the world for the  best kinds of sanctuary. The first time you're on a lee shore there,  in a full gale, you may well be excused for shrinking back from the  wild white line of devouring breakers. But when you actually make for  them you find the coast opening into archipelagoes of islands, to let  you safely through into the snug little \"tickles,\" between island and  mainland, where you can ride out the storm as well as you could in a  landlocked harbour. This is typical of many another pleasant surprise.  Labrador decidedly improves on acquaintance. The fogs have been  grossly exaggerated. The Atlantic seaboard is clearer than the British  Isles, which, by the way, lie in exactly the same latitudes. And the  Gulf is far clearer than New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Banks. The  climate is exceptionally healthy, the air a most invigorating tonic,  and the cold no greater than in many a civilized northern land.  Besides, there is a considerable range of temperatures in a country  whose extreme north and south lie 1,000 miles apart, one in the  latitude of Greenland, the other in that of Paris. Taking the Labrador  peninsula geographically, as including the whole area east of a line  run up the Saguenay and on from lake St. John to James bay, it  comprises 560,000 square miles--eleven Englands! The actual residents  hardly number 20,000. About twice as many outsiders appear off the  coasts at certain seasons. So it would take a tenfold increase, afloat  and ashore, to make one human being to each square mile of land. But,  all the same, wild life needs conservation there, and needs it badly,  as we shall presently see.    Most of Labrador is a rocky tableland, still rising from the depths,  with some old beaches as much as 1,500 feet above the present level of  the sea. The St. Lawrence seaboard is famous for its rivers and  forests. The Atlantic seaboard has the same myriads of islands, is  magnificently bold, is pierced by fiords unexcelled in Norway, and  crowned by mountains higher than any others east of the Rockies.  Hamilton inlet runs in 150 miles. At Ramah the cliffs rise sheer three  thousand five hundred feet and more. The Four peaks, still untrodden  by the foot of man, rise more than twice as high again. And the  colouration, of every splendid hue, adds beauty to the grandeur of the  scene. Inland, there are lakes up to 100 miles long, big rivers by the  score, deep canyons and foaming rapids--to say nothing of the  countless waterfalls, of which the greatest equals two Niagaras. This  vast country is accessible by sea on three sides, and will soon be  accessible by land on the fourth. It lies directly half-way between  Great Britain and our own North West and is 1,000 miles nearer London  than New York is. Its timber, mines and water-power will be  increasingly exploited. It should also become increasingly attractive  to the best type of tourist, naturalist and sportsman. But supposing  all this does happen. The mines, water-powers and lumbering will only  create small towns and villages. There will surely be some  conservation to have the forests used and not abused especially by  fire: and the white man should remember that he is the worst of all in  turning a land from green to black. Except in the southwest and a few  isolated spots, the country cannot be farmed. At the same time, the  urban population must have communications with the outside world, by  which regular supplies can come in. This will make the settlers  independent of wild life for necessary food; and wild life, in any  case, would be too precarious if exploited in the usual way. The  traders in wild-animal products, as well as the naturalists, sportsmen  and tourists, are interested in keeping the rest of the country well  stocked. So that, one way and another, the human and wild-animal life  will not conflict, as they do where farming creates a widespread rural  population, or wanton destruction of forests ruins land and water, and  human and animal life have to suffer for it afterwards. All the  different places required for business spheres of influence in the  near future, added to all the business spheres of the present, can  hardly exceed the area of one whole England, especially if all  suitable areas are not thrown open simultaneously to lumbering, at the  risk of the usual bad results. So there will remain ten other  Englands, admirably fitted, in all respects, to grow wild life in the  most beneficial abundance, and quite able to do so indefinitely, if a  reasonable amount of general protection is combined with well-situated  sanctuaries.    The fauna is much more richly varied than people who think of  Labrador as nothing but an arctic barren are inclined to suppose. The  fisheries have been known for centuries, especially the cod, which has  a prerogative right to the simple word \"fish.\" There are herring and  lobsters in the Gulf, plenty of salmon and trout in most of the  rivers, winninish in all the tributary waters of the Hamilton, as well  as in lake St. John, whitefish in the lakes, and so forth. Then, the  stone-carrying chub is one of the most interesting creatures in the  world.... But the fish and fisheries have problems of their own too  great for incidental treatment; and I shall pass on to the birds and  mammals.    Yet I must not forget the \"flies\"--who that has felt them once can  ever forget them? Labrador is not a very happy hunting-ground for the  entomologist. But all it lacks in variety of kinds it more than makes  up in number of individuals, especially in the detestable trio of  bot-flies, blackflies and mosquitoes. The bot-fly infests the caribou  and will probably infest the reindeer. The blackfly and mosquito  attack both man and beast in maddening millions. The mosquito is not  malarious. But that is the only bad thing he is not. Destruction is  \"conservation\" so far as \"flies,\" parasites and disease germs are  concerned.    Labrador has over 200 species of birds, from humming-birds and  sanderlings to eagles, gannets, loons and herons. Among those able to  hold their own, with proper encouragement, are the following: two  loons, two murres, the puffin, guillemot, razor-billed auk, dovekie  and pomarine jaeger; six gulls--ivory, kittiwake, glaucous, great  black-back, herring and Bonaparte; two terns--arctic and common; the  fulmar, two shearwaters, two cormorants, the red-breasted merganser  and the gannet; seven ducks--the black, golden-eye, old squaw and  harlequin, with the American, king and Greenland eiders; three  scoters; four geese--snow, blue, brant and Canada; two phalaropes,  several sandpipers, with the Hudsonian godwit and both yellowlegs; two  snipes; five plovers; and the Eskimo and Hudsonian curlews. These two  curlews should be absolutely closed to all shooting everywhere for  several seasons. They are on the verge of extinction; and it may even  now be too late to save them. The great blue heron and American  bittern are not common, but less rare than they are supposed to be.  Except for the willow and rock ptarmigans the land game-birds are not  many in kind or numbers. There are a fair number of ruffed grouse in  the south, and more spruce grouse in the north. The birds of prey are  well represented by a few golden and more bald-headed eagles, the  American rough-legged and other hawks, the black and the white  gyrfalcons, the osprey, and eight owls, including the great horned  owl, the boldest bird of all. The raven is widely distributed all the  year round. Several woodpeckers, kingfishers, jays, bluebird,  kingbird, chickadee, snow bunting; several sparrows, including,  fortunately, the white-crowned, white-throat and song, but now,  unfortunately, the English as well. There are blackbirds, red-polls, a  dozen warblers, the American robin, hermit thrush and ruby-throated  humming-bird.    Both the land and sea mammals are of great importance. Several whales  are well known. The Right is almost exterminated; but the Greenland,  or Bow-head, is found along the edge of the ice in all Hudsonian  waters. The Pollock is rare, and the Sperm, or Cachalot, as nearly  exterminated as the Right. But the Little-piked, or _rostrata_, is  found inshore along the north and east, the Bottle-nose on the north,  the Humpback on the east and south; and the Finback and Sulphur-bottom  are common and widely distributed, especially on the east. The Little  White whale, or \"White porpoise,\" is fairly common all round; the  Killer is widely distributed, but most numerous on the east, where the  Narwhal is also found. The Harbour and Striped porpoises, and the  Common and Bottle-nosed dolphins, are chiefly on the east and south.  There are six Seals--the Harbour, Ringed, Harp, Bearded, Grey and  Hooded. The Harbour seal is also called the \"Common\" and the \"Wise\"  seal, and is the _vitulina_ of zoology. It is common all round the  coasts, and the Indians of the interior assert that many"]]]
