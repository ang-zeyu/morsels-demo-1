It is in the third year that  architectural subjects are brought in, and with studies and lectures  on the architectural styles, smaller problems in design, sanitary  engineering, and theory of roofs and bridges, the full course is  opened for the fourth year, of steel construction in office buildings  (design and computations), specifications by lectures, thorough study  of ventilation, designs for roof trusses and girders, and hydraulics,  finally ending with a thesis design. To supplement this prescribed  work the students have organized the Architectural Club of the  University. The objects of this society are to distribute blue prints  to members from a growing collection of negatives owned by the Club;  to collect specimens and models of building material; to aid in  securing a students' library, and to hold monthly competitions in  pen-and-ink rendering, besides managing any of the affairs of the  architectural course in which the students as a body desire to act.  It is an organization for mutual benefits and already has made itself  felt, although only two years old.           *       *       *       *       *    After a summer of more or less inactivity, during which, in June,  its quarters were moved to 77 City Hall, where it is much more  conveniently located, the Cleveland Architectural Club has taken  up its work with characteristic enthusiasm, and already a vigorous  winter's work has been planned, beginning on November 14, with the  annual banquet at the Hollenden Hotel, followed by the yearly meeting  for the reports of officers and the election of new officers.    On the evening of January 9, 1896, the first annual exhibition of the  Club will be inaugurated, to continue during the balance of the week.  This will be the first distinctively architectural exhibition ever  held in Cleveland.    In the last competition, \"An Entrance to Lake View Cemetery,\" the  mentions were as follows: W.D. Benes, first; Chas. S. Schneider,  second; Wilbur M. Hall, third; Geo. W. Andrews, fourth; L.R. Rice,  fifth.    The membership of the Club is rapidly increasing, a majority of the  members of the local chapter of the A.I.A. having already become  associate members.    [Illustration: LXXVI.

If collected by some concerted plan, to  include the premiated or mentioned designs in the club competitions,  and all sent to some one city or club, they could be exhibited and  then passed on to the next club in the circuit.    Exchange of ideas and comparison of methods among the architectural  clubs is much to be desired and could not help resulting in  benefit. No more direct or easier way of opening relations of mutual  helpfulness could be found than this, and we trust that some one  will take it upon himself to take the initiative. Our correspondent  intimates that this might be the first step towards a national  federation of architectural clubs. It is rather unsafe to speculate  upon what might take place in such an event.          Reviews.          _Suggestions in Brickwork_ with illustrations from the      Architecture of Italy, together with a Catalogue of Bricks,      made by the Hydraulic-Press Brick Companies, Eastern      Hydraulic-Press Brick Co., Philadelphia, 1895. $3.00.    To the architect who desires to use iron or steel in construction and  to figure out his own drawings for the purpose, nothing can take the  place of the handbooks furnished by the great iron and steel companies  to aid in this work; and the convenience of having all tables,  formulas, etc., together with a reliable catalogue of commercial  and practical possibilities, all in one little handbook is not to be  over-estimated.    What has in the past been done for the users of constructional iron  and steel work has now been attempted in a very different field for  architects who may wish to design in brick, both plain, moulded and  ornamental. That this attempt is well considered and most thoroughly  carried out would be perfectly certain if for no other reason than for  the name of the compiler, Mr. Frank Miles Day, of Philadelphia. There  have been similar attempts made in the past, but they are crude in  comparison with the handsome volume now before us. It does not matter  that this beautifully printed and illustrated book is a perfectly  frank advertisement, put forward for purely business reasons. It has  a most important bearing upon the progress and development of the best  American architecture.    The suggestions in designs are very largely taken from the buildings  in the north of Italy, adapted, of course, to the requirements of  modern bricks. They show at all times a most discriminating and  delicate taste and familiarity with the best architecture.    The ostensible purpose of the book is to remedy the difficulty which  all who have attempted to use bricks in designing have experienced to  a greater or less extent, of finding forms suitable for a given space.    The book is divided into two distinct parts, the first made up of  twenty-eight plates of designs with accompanying descriptive matter,  for arcades, loggias, doorways, windows, moulded bands, cornices,  brick mosaics, fireplaces, balconies, piers and columns, and gate  posts, all carefully drawn to scale and with the numbers of patterns  used in each case referring to the catalogue, which occupies the  second portion of the book. In the catalogue each pattern is shown  in isometric view, with shadows indicated where it will add to the  cleanness of the cut, and upon the opposite page the profile of the  brick is shown at half full size. This portion of the catalogue  is rendered much more useful than it would otherwise be, by the  classification which has been adopted. By this means it is easy to  find most any shape desired.    The choice of the patterns themselves deserves the highest  commendation.    [Illustration: LXXVII. Manoir d'Ango, Normandy.]    [Illustration: SKETCH BY WILSON EYRE, JR. See The Architectural  Review, Vol. IV, No. 1.]    The forthcoming number of _The Architectural Review_ (Vol. IV, No. 1)  will include several noteworthy features. The plates are of the same  class of subjects which has given the paper its present high standing.  The four gelatine plates are devoted to illustrating Messrs. Cram,  Wentworth & Goodhue's design for the Public Library to be erected in  Fall River, Mass. The two remaining line plates are devoted to the  Bowery Bank building in New York by Messrs. McKim, Mead & White. The  principal article in the text portion of the number is a sketch of a  trip across England from Liverpool to London by Wilson Eyre, Jr.  The delicate and, in the main, truthful reproductions of Mr. Eyre's  incomparable sketches give the article a more than common interest.  Of all American architects who have been attracted by the picturesque  features of English and French domestic work, no one has shown a  closer sympathy or been able in his sketches to render more of its  charm than Mr. Eyre.

[Transcriber's Note: issue 8]      And speaking of costumes reminds me of some very successful ones, and  particularly that of a Highlander, the whole of which was made on  the spot from the club's \"props\" and was complete even to a practical  bagpipe, which was composed of three tin horns, a penny whistle, a  piece of burlap, and a rubber tobacco pouch. Both in tone and looks it  was an exceedingly good imitation of the genuine article.    One of the things that has afforded the P.D.'s a great deal of  amusement is a supposititious newspaper, wherein the members are  interviewed on any and all occasions and many interesting things  brought to light. In one of them, for instance, Ictinus confides to  the reporter that he was born in the shadow of the Parthenon. This  mixing up of one's peculiarities, habits, and nationality with those  of the illustrious individual whose name he bears, is capable of being  given many laughable twists and has been taken advantage of in many  amusing skits.    Besides the interviews there are fashion notes, society and sporting  notes, architectural news, and receipts. Among the latter is a receipt  for making Welsh rare-bits that should be in the possession of every  one addicted to them.    [Illustration: THE \"P.D.'S\" PREPARED FOR WORK.]    The club has been regaled at various times with comic opera (with  scenery painted for the occasion), readings and recitations; and at  one of the annual dinners an illustrated history of the club and its  members was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#2)"],[1,"on the most important  questions was the most perfect philosophy. And I have so diligently  applied myself to this pursuit, that I have already ventured to have a  school like the Greeks. And lately when you left us, having many of my  friends about me, I attempted at my Tusculan villa what I could do in  that way; for as I formerly used to practise declaiming, which nobody  continued longer than myself, so this is now to be the declamation of  my old age. I desired any one to propose a question which he wished to  have discussed, and then I argued that point either sitting or walking;  and so I have compiled the scholae, as the Greeks call them, of five  days, in as many books. We proceeded in this manner: when he who had  proposed the subject for discussion had said what he thought proper, I  spoke against him; for this is, you know, the old and Socratic method  of arguing against another's opinion; for Socrates thought that thus  the truth would more easily be arrived at. But to give you a better  notion of our disputations, I will not barely send you an account of  them, but represent them to you as they were carried on; therefore let  the introduction be thus:    V. _A._ To me death seems to be an evil.    _M._ What, to those who are already dead? or to those who must die?    _A._ To both.    _M._ It is a misery, then, because an evil?    _A._ Certainly.    _M._ Then those who have already died, and those who have still got to  die, are both miserable?    _A._ So it appears to me.    _M._ Then all are miserable?    _A._ Every one.    _M._ And, indeed, if you wish to be consistent, all that are already  born, or ever shall be, are not only miserable, but always will be so;  for should you maintain those only to be miserable, you would not  except any one living, for all must die; but there should be an end of  misery in death. But seeing that the dead are miserable, we are born to  eternal misery, for they must of consequence be miserable who died a  hundred thousand years ago; or rather, all that have ever been born.    _A._ So, indeed, I think.    _M._ Tell me, I beseech you, are you afraid of the three-headed  Cerberus in the shades below, and the roaring waves of Cocytus, and the  passage over Acheron, and Tantalus expiring with thirst, while the  water touches his chin; and Sisyphus,        Who sweats with arduous toil in vain      The steepy summit of the mount to gain?    Perhaps, too, you dread the inexorable judges, Minos and Rhadamanthus;  before whom neither L. Crassus nor M. Antonius can defend you; and  where, since the cause lies before Grecian judges, you will not even be  able to employ Demosthenes; but you must plead for yourself before a  very great assembly. These things perhaps you dread, and therefore look  on death as an eternal evil.    VI. _A._ Do you take me to be so imbecile as to give credit to such  things?    _M._ What, do you not believe them?    _A._ Not in the least.    _M._ I am sorry to hear that.    _A._ Why, I beg?    _M._ Because I could have been very eloquent in speaking against them.    _A._ And who could not on such a subject? or what trouble is it to  refute these monstrous inventions of the poets and painters?[6]    _M._ And yet you have books of philosophers full of arguments against  these.    _A._ A great waste of time, truly! for who is so weak as to be  concerned about them?    _M._ If, then, there is no one miserable in the infernal regions, there  can be no one there at all.    _A._ I am altogether of that opinion.    _M._ Where, then, are those you call miserable? or what place do they  inhabit? For, if they exist at all, they must be somewhere.    _A._ I, indeed, am of opinion that they are nowhere.    _M._ Then they have no existence at all.    _A._ Even so, and yet they are miserable for this very reason, that  they have no existence.    _M._ I had rather now have you afraid of Cerberus than speak thus  inaccurately.    _A._ In what respect?    _M._ Because you admit him to exist whose existence you deny with the  same breath. Where now is your sagacity? When you say any one is  miserable, you say that he who does not exist, does exist.    _A._ I am not so absurd as to say that.    _M._ What is it that you do say, then?    _A._ I say, for instance, that Marcus Crassus is miserable in being  deprived of such great riches as his by death; that Cn. Pompey is  miserable in being taken from such glory and honor; and, in short, that  all are miserable who are deprived of this light of life.    _M._ You have returned to the same point, for to be miserable implies  an existence; but you just now denied that the dead had any existence:  if, then, they have not, they can be nothing; and if so, they are not  even miserable.    _A._ Perhaps I do not express what I mean, for I look upon this very  circumstance, not to exist after having existed, to be very miserable.    _M._ What, more so than not to have existed at all? Therefore, those  who are not yet born are miserable because they are not; and we  ourselves, if we are to be miserable after death, were miserable before  we were born: but I do not remember that I was miserable before I was  born; and I should be glad to know, if your memory is better, what you  recollect of yourself before you were born.    VII. _A._ You are pleasant: as if I had said that those men are  miserable who are not born, and not that they are so who are dead.    _M._ You say, then, that they are so?    _A._ Yes; I say that because they no longer exist after having existed  they are miserable.    _M._ You do not perceive that you are asserting contradictions; for  what is a greater contradiction, than that that should be not only  miserable, but should have any existence at all, which does not exist?  When you go out at the Capene gate and see the tombs of the Calatini,  the Scipios, Servilii, and Metelli, do you look on them as miserable?    _A._ Because you press me with a word, henceforward I will not say they  are miserable absolutely, but miserable on this account, because they  have no existence.    _M._ You do not say, then, \"M. Crassus is miserable,\" but only  \"Miserable M. Crassus.\"    _A._ Exactly so.    _M._ As if it did not follow that whatever you speak of in that manner  either is or is not. Are you not acquainted with the first principles  of logic? For this is the first thing they lay down, Whatever is  asserted (for that is the best way that occurs to me, at the moment, of  rendering the Greek term [Greek: axioma]; if I can think of a more  accurate expression hereafter, I will use it), is asserted as being  either true or false. When, therefore, you say, \"Miserable M. Crassus,\"  you either say this, \"M. Crassus is miserable,\" so that some judgment  may be made whether it is true or false, or you say nothing at all.    _A._ Well, then, I now own that the dead are not miserable, since you  have drawn from me a concession that they who do not exist at all can  not be miserable. What then? We that are alive, are we not wretched,  seeing we must die? for what is there agreeable in life, when we must  night and day reflect that, at some time or other, we must die?    VIII. _M._ Do you not, then, perceive how great is the evil from which  you have delivered human nature?    _A._ By what means?    _M._ Because, if to die were miserable to the dead, to live would be a  kind of infinite and eternal misery. Now, however, I see a goal, and  when I have reached it, there is nothing more to be feared; but you  seem to me to follow the opinion of Epicharmus,[7] a man of some  discernment, and sharp enough for a Sicilian.    _A._ What opinion? for I do not recollect it.    _M._ I will tell you if I can in Latin; for you know I am no more used  to bring in Latin sentences in a Greek discourse than Greek in a Latin  one.    _A._ And that is right enough. But what is that opinion of Epicharmus?    _M._      I would not die, but yet      Am not concerned that I shall be dead.    _A._ I now recollect the Greek; but since you have obliged me to grant  that the dead are not miserable, proceed to convince me that it is not  miserable to be under a necessity of dying.    _M._ That is easy enough; but I have greater things in hand.    _A._ How comes that to be so easy? And what are those things of more  consequence?    _M._ Thus: because, if there is no evil after death, then even death  itself can be none; for that which immediately succeeds that is a state  where you grant that there is no evil: so that even to be obliged to  die can be no evil, for that is only the being obliged to arrive at a  place where we allow that no evil is.    _A._ I beg you will be more explicit on this point, for these subtle  arguments force me sooner to admissions than to conviction. But what  are those more important things about which you say that you are  occupied?    _M._ To teach you, if I can, that death is not only no evil, but a  good.    _A._ I do not insist on that, but should be glad to hear you argue it,  for even though you should not prove your point, yet you will prove  that death is no evil. But I will not interrupt you; I would rather  hear a continued discourse.    _M._ What, if I should ask you a question, would you not answer?    _A._ That would look like pride; but I would rather you should not ask  but where necessity requires.    IX. _M._ I will comply with your wishes, and explain as well as I can  what you require; but not with any idea that, like the Pythian Apollo,  what I say must needs be certain and indisputable, but as a mere man,  endeavoring to arrive at probabilities by conjecture, for I have no  ground to proceed further on than probability. Those men may call their  statements indisputable who assert that what they say can be perceived  by the senses, and who proclaim themselves philosophers by profession.    _A._ Do as you please: We are ready to hear you.    _M._ The first thing, then, is to inquire what death, which "]]]
