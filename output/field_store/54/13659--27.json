[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#2)"],[1,"to all church government  whatsoever; or, 3d, through the different opinions about church  government, which are to be found among pious people and ministers: by  all which the weak and unstable minds of many are cast into a maze of  many confused thoughts and irresolutions.    3. Though many learned treatises have been published, some whereof have  positively asserted, others have polemically vindicated divers parts of  church government, and the divine right thereof, yet hitherto no  treatise of this nature is extant, positively laying open the nature of  a divine right, what it is, and a system of that government, which is  so, and proving both by the Scriptures; without which, how shall the  judgments and consciences of men be satisfied, that this is that church  government, according to the word of God, which they have covenanted to  endeavor to promote, and whereto they are obliged to submit? And since  it is our lot to travel in an unbeaten path, we, therefore, promise to  ourselves, from all sober and judicious readers, the greater candor and  ingenuity in their measuring of our steps and progress herein.    II. The advantage which may probably accrue hereupon, we hope shall be  manifold: For, 1. Who can tell but that some of them, that in some  things are misled and contrary-minded, may be convinced and regained?  and it will be no small reward of our labors if but one erring brother  may be brought back. 2. Some satisfaction may redound to such as are of  doubtful, unresolved minds, by removing of their doubts and scruples,  and ripening of their resolutions, to settle more safely in point of  church government. 3. Those that as yet are unseen in the matter of  church government, or that want money to buy, or leisure to read many  books upon this subject, may here have much in a little, and  competently inform themselves of the whole body of the government. 4.  Consequently upon the attaining of the former ends, the work of  reformation will be much facilitated and smoothed, the hearts of the  people being prepared for the Lord and his ordinances. 5. The present  attempt (if it reach not to that completeness and satisfactoriness which  is desired) may yet incite some of our brethren of more acute and  polished judgments to embark themselves in some further discoveries for  the public benefit of the Church. 6. But though it should fall out that  in all the former we should be utterly disappointed, we shall have this  peace and comfort upon our own spirits, that we have not hid our talent  in the earth, nor neglected to bear witness to this part of Christ's  truth, touching the government of his Church, by his kingly power,  wherein Christ was opposed so much in all ages, Psalm ii. 1, 2, 3; Luke  xix. 14, 27; Acts iv., and for which Christ did suffer so much in a  special and immediate manner, as[1] some have observed. For this end  Christ came into the world, (and for this end we came into the  ministerial calling,) to bear witness to the truth.    III. Finally, the present opportunity of publishing a treatise on this  subject doth much incite and encourage us therein. For at this time we  are beginning, in this province of London, (and we hope the whole  kingdom will, with all convenient speed, and due caution, second us,) to  put that covenanted church government into actual execution, which we  have a long time intended in our deliberate resolutions. So that  generally we shall be engaged in the government one way or other, either  as acting in it as the church officers, or as submitting to it as church  members: now, how shall any truly conscientious person, either act in  it, or conform and submit unto it with faith, judgment, and alacrity,  till he be in some competent measure satisfied of the divine right  thereof?    Will mere prudence, without a divine right, be a sufficient basis to  erect the whole frame of church government upon, as some conceive?  Prudentials, according to general rules of Scripture, may be of use in  circumstantials, but will bare prudentials in substantials also satisfy  either our God, our covenant, our consciences, or our end in this great  work of reformation? What conscientious person durst have a hand in  acting as a ruling elder, did he not apprehend the word of God holds  forth a divine right for the ruling elder? Who durst have a hand in the  censures of admonishing the unruly, excommunicating the scandalous and  obstinate, and of restoring the penitent, were there not a divine right  hereof revealed in the Scripture, &c. Now, therefore, that ruling  elders, and the rest of the people, may begin this happy work  conscientiously, judiciously, cheerfully, in some measure perceiving the  divine right of the whole government, wherein they engage themselves,  cleared by Scripture, we hope, by God's blessing, that this small tract  will afford some seasonable assistance, which will be unto us a very  acceptable recompense.    Thus far of the nature of this treatise, and the grounds of our  publishing thereof. In the next place, a few doubts or scruples touching  church government here asserted, being succinctly resolved, we shall  preface no further.    _Doubt_ 1. Many scruple, and much question the divine right of the whole  frame of church government; as, 1. Whether there be any particular  church government of divine right? 2. What that government is? 3. What  church officers or members of elderships are of divine right? 4. Whether  parochial or congregational elderships be of divine right? 5. Whether  classical presbyteries be of divine right? 6. Whether provincial,  national, and ecumenical assemblies be of divine right? 7. Whether  appeals from congregational to classical, provincial, national, and  ecumenical assemblies, and their power to determine upon such appeals,  be of divine right? 8. Whether the power of censures in the  congregational eldership, or any other assembly, be of divine right? 9.  Whether there be any particular rules in the Scripture directing persons  or assemblies in the exercise of their power? 10. Whether the civil  magistrates, or their committees' and commissioners' execution of church  censures be contrary to that way of government which Christ hath  appointed in his Church?    _Resol_. To all or most of these doubts some competent satisfaction may  be had from this treatise ensuing, if seriously considered. For, 1. That  there is a church government of divine right, now under the New  Testament, declared in Scripture, is proved, Part I. 2. What that  government is in particular, is evidenced both by the description of  church government, and the confirmation of the parts thereof by  Scripture, Part. II. chap. 1, and so to the end of the book: whereby it  is cleared that the presbyterial government is that particular  government which is of divine right, according to the word of God. 3.  What ordinary church officers, (members of the several elderships,) are  of divine right, is proved, Part II, chap. 11, sect. 1, viz. pastors and  teachers, with ruling elders. 4. That parochial or congregational  elderships, consisting of preaching and ruling elders, are of divine  right, is manifested, Part II. chap. 12. 5. That classical presbyteries,  or assemblies, and their power in church government, are of divine  right, is demonstrated, Part II. chap. 13. 6. That synodical assemblies,  or councils in general, (consequently provincial, national, or  ecumenical councils in particular,) and their power in church  government, are of divine right, is cleared, Part II. chap. 14. 7. That  appeals from congregational elderships, to classical and synodical  assemblies, from lesser to greater assemblies associated, and power in  those assemblies to determine authoritatively in such, appeals, are of  divine right, is proved, Part II. chap. 15. 8. That the power of church  censures is in Christ's own church officers only as the first subject  and proper receptacle there of divine right, is cleared, Part II. chap.  11, sect. 2, which officers of Christ have and execute the said power  respectively, in all the ruling assemblies, congregational, classical,  or synodical. See section 3, and chap. 12, 13, 14, 15. 9. That the  Scriptures hold forth, touching church government, not only general, but  also many particular rules, sufficiently directing both persons and  assemblies how they should duly put in execution their power of church,  government. This is made good, Part II. chap. 4; and those that desire  to know which are these rules in particular, may consult those  learned[2] centuriators of Magdeburg, who have collected and  methodically digested, in the very words of the Scripture, a system of  canons or rules, touching church government, as in the preface to those  rules they do profess, saying, touching things pertaining to the  government of the Church, the apostles delivered certain canons, which  we will add in order, &c., the very heads of which would be too prolix  to recite. 10. Finally, that neither the supreme civil magistrate, as  such, nor consequently any commissioner or committees whatsoever,  devised and erected by his authority, are the proper subject of the  formal power of church government, nor may lawfully, by any virtue of  the magistratical office, dispense any ecclesiastical censures or  ordinances: but that such undertakings are inconsistent with that way of  government which Christ hath appointed in his Church, is evidenced, Part  II. chap. 9, well compared with chap. 11.    _Doubt_ 2. But this presbyterial government is likely to be an arbitrary  and tyrannical government, forasmuch as the presbyters of the assembly  of divines and others (who, Diotrephes-like, generally affect  domineering) have desired an unlimited power, according to their own  judgments and prudence, in excommunicating men from the ordinances in  cases of scandal.    _Resol_. A heinous charge, could it be proved against the presbyterial  government. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#2)"],[1,"ce. They  swarmed to an incredible degree, not only devouring the grain upon the  straw that had never been cut, but clearing out every single ear in the  wheat-ricks that were standing about the country. Nothing remained in  these ricks but straw, pierced with tunnels and runs, the home and  breeding-place of mice, which thence poured forth into the fields. Such  grain as had been left in barns and granaries, in mills, and in  warehouses of the deserted towns, disappeared in the same manner.    When men tried to raise crops in small gardens and enclosures for their  sustenance, these legions of mice rushed in and destroyed the produce of  their labour. Nothing could keep them out, and if a score were killed, a  hundred more supplied their place. These mice were preyed upon by  kestrel hawks, owls, and weasels; but at first they made little or no  appreciable difference. In a few years, however, the weasels, having  such a superabundance of food, trebled in numbers, and in the same way  the hawks, owls, and foxes increased. There was then some relief, but  even now at intervals districts are invaded, and the granaries and the  standing corn suffer from these depredations.    This does not happen every year, but only at intervals, for it is  noticed that mice abound very much more in some seasons than others. The  extraordinary multiplication of these creatures was the means of  providing food for the cats that had been abandoned in the towns, and  came forth into the country in droves. Feeding on the mice, they became,  in a very short time, quite wild, and their descendants now roam the  forest.    In our houses we still have several varieties of the domestic cat, such  as the tortoise-shell, which is the most prized, but when the  above-mentioned cats became wild, after a while the several varieties  disappeared, and left but one wild kind. Those which are now so often  seen in the forest, and which do so much mischief about houses and  enclosures, are almost all greyish, some being striped, and they are  also much longer in the body than the tame. A few are jet black; their  skins are then preferred by hunters.    Though the forest cat retires from the sight of man as much as possible,  yet it is extremely fierce in defence of its young, and instances have  been known where travellers in the woods have been attacked upon  unwittingly approaching their dens. Dropping from the boughs of a tree  upon the shoulders, the creature flies at the face, inflicting deep  scratches and bites, exceedingly painful, and sometimes dangerous, from  the tendency to fester. But such cases are rare, and the reason the  forest cat is so detested is because it preys upon fowls and poultry,  mounting with ease the trees or places where they roost.    Almost worse than the mice were the rats, which came out of the old  cities in such vast numbers that the people who survived and saw them  are related to have fled in fear. This terror, however, did not last so  long as the evil of the mice, for the rats, probably not finding  sufficient food when together, scattered abroad, and were destroyed  singly by the cats and dogs, who slew them by thousands, far more than  they could afterwards eat, so that the carcases were left to decay. It  is said that, overcome with hunger, these armies of rats in some cases  fell upon each other, and fed on their own kindred. They are still  numerous, but do not appear to do the same amount of damage as is  occasionally caused by the mice, when the latter invade the cultivated  lands.    The dogs, of course, like the cats, were forced by starvation into the  fields, where they perished in incredible numbers. Of many species of  dogs which are stated to have been plentiful among the ancients, we have  now nothing but the name. The poodle is extinct, the Maltese terrier,  the Pomeranian, the Italian greyhound, and, it is believed, great  numbers of crosses and mongrels have utterly disappeared. There was none  to feed them, and they could not find food for themselves, nor could  they stand the rigour of the winter when exposed to the frost in the  open air.    Some kinds, more hardy and fitted by nature for the chase, became wild,  and their descendants are now found in the woods. Of these, there are  three sorts which keep apart from each other, and are thought not to  interbreed. The most numerous are the black. The black wood-dog is short  and stoutly made, with shaggy hair, sometimes marked with white patches.    There can be no doubt that it is the descendant of the ancient  sheep-dog, for it is known that the sheep-dog was of that character, and  it is said that those who used to keep sheep soon found their dogs  abandon the fold, and join the wild troops that fell upon the sheep. The  black wood-dogs hunt in packs of ten or more (as many as forty have been  counted), and are the pest of the farmer, for, unless his flocks are  protected at night within stockades or enclosures, they are certain to  be attacked. Not satisfied with killing enough to satisfy hunger, these  dogs tear and mangle for sheer delight of blood, and will destroy twenty  times as many as they can eat, leaving the miserably torn carcases on  the field. Nor are the sheep always safe by day if the wood-dogs happen  to be hungry. The shepherd is, therefore, usually accompanied by two or  three mastiffs, of whose great size and strength the others stand in  awe. At night, and when in large packs, starving in the snow, not even  the mastiffs can check them.    No wood-dog, of any kind, has ever been known to attack man, and the  hunter in the forest hears their bark in every direction without fear.  It is, nevertheless, best to retire out of their way when charging sheep  in packs, for they then seem seized with a blind fury, and some who have  endeavoured to fight them have been thrown down and seriously mauled.  But this has been in the blindness of their rush; no instance has ever  been known of their purposely attacking man.    These black wood-dogs will also chase and finally pull down cattle, if  they can get within the enclosures, and even horses have fallen victims  to their untiring thirst for blood. Not even the wild cattle can always  escape, despite their strength, and they have been known to run down  stags, though not their usual quarry.    The next kind of wild wood-dog is the yellow, a smaller animal, with  smooth hair inclining to a yellow colour, which lives principally upon  game, chasing all, from the hare to the stag. It is as swift, or nearly  as swift, as the greyhound, and possesses greater endurance. In coursing  the hare, it not uncommonly happens that these dogs start from the brake  and take the hare, when nearly exhausted, from the hunter's hounds. They  will in the same way follow a stag, which has been almost run down by  the hunters, and bring him to bay, though in this case they lose their  booty, dispersing through fear of man, when the hunters come up in a  body.    But such is their love of the chase, that they are known to assemble  from their lairs at the distant sound of the horn, and, as the hunters  ride through the woods, they often see the yellow dogs flitting along  side by side with them through bush and fern. These animals sometimes  hunt singly, sometimes in couples, and as the season advances, and  winter approaches, in packs of eight or twelve. They never attack sheep  or cattle, and avoid man, except when they perceive he is engaged in the  chase. There is little doubt that they are the descendants of the dogs  which the ancients called lurchers, crossed, perhaps, with the  greyhound, and possibly other breeds. When the various species of dogs  were thrown on their own resources, those only withstood the exposure  and hardships which were naturally hardy, and possessed natural aptitude  for the chase.    The third species of wood-dog is the white. They are low on the legs, of  a dingy white colour, and much smaller than the other two. They neither  attack cattle nor game, though fond of hunting rabbits. This dog is, in  fact, a scavenger, living upon the carcases of dead sheep and animals,  which are found picked clean in the night. For this purpose it haunts  the neighbourhood of habitations, and prowls in the evening over heaps  of refuse, scampering away at the least alarm, for it is extremely  timid.    It is perfectly harmless, for even the poultry do not dread it, and it  will not face a tame cat, if by chance the two meet. It is rarely met  with far from habitations, though it will accompany an army on the  march. It may be said to remain in one district. The black and yellow  dogs, on the contrary, roam about the forest without apparent home. One  day the hunter sees signs of their presence, and perhaps may, for a  month afterwards, not so much as hear a bark.    This uncertainty in the case of the black dog is the bane of the  shepherds; for, not seeing or hearing anything of the enemy for months  altogether, in spite of former experience their vigilance relaxes, and  suddenly, while they sleep, their flocks are scattered. We still have,  among tame dogs, the mastiff, terrier, spaniel, deerhound, and  greyhound, all of which are as faithful to man as ever.          CHAPTER II    WILD ANIMALS      When the ancients departed, great numbers of their cattle perished. It  was not so much the want of food as the inability to endure exposure  that caused their death; a few winters are related to have so reduced  them that they died by hundreds, many mangled by dogs. The hardiest that  remained became perfectly wild, and the wood cattle are now more  difficult to approach than deer.    There are two kinds, the white and the black. The white (sometimes dun)  are believed to be the survivors of the domestic roan-and-white, for the  cattle in our enclosures at the present day are of that colour. The  black are smaller, and are doubtless little changed from their state in  the olden"]]]
