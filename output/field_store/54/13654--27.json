It is that the California Missions are the only  Missions (except one or two in Arizona and a few in Texas) and that they  are the oldest in the country. This is entirely an error. A look at a  few dates and historic facts will soon correct this mistake.    Cortes had conquered Mexico; Pizarro was conqueror in Peru; Balboa had  discovered the South Sea (the Pacific Ocean) and all Spain was aflame  with gold-lust. Narvaez, in great pomp and ceremony, with six hundred  soldiers of fortune, many of them of good families and high social  station, in his five specially built vessels, sailed to gain fame,  fortune and the fountain of perpetual youth in what we now call Florida.    Disaster, destruction, death--I had almost said entire  annihilation--followed him and scarce allowed his expedition to land,  ere it was swallowed up, so that had it not been for the escape of  Cabeza de Vaca, his treasurer, and a few others, there would have been  nothing left to suggest that the history of the start of the expedition  was any other than a myth. But De Vaca and his companions were saved,  only to fall, however, into the hands of the Indians. What an unhappy  fate! Was life to end thus? Were all the hopes, ambitions and glorious  dreams of De Vaca to terminate in a few years of bondage to  degraded savages?    Unthinkable, unbearable, unbelievable. De Vaca was a man of power, a man  of thought. He reasoned the matter out. Somewhere on the other side of  the great island--for the world then thought of the newly-discovered  America as a vast island--his people were to be found. He would work his  way to them and freedom. He communicated his hope and his determination  to his companions in captivity. Henceforth, regardless of whether they  were held as slaves by the Indians, or worshiped as demigods,--makers of  great medicine,--either keeping them from their hearts' desire, they  never once ceased in their efforts to cross the country and reach the  Spanish settlements on the other side. For eight long years the weary  march westward continued, until, at length, the Spanish soldiers of the  Viceroy of New Spain were startled at seeing men who were almost  skeletons, clad in the rudest aboriginal garb, yet speaking the purest  Castilian and demanding in the tones of those used to obedience that  they be taken to his noble and magnificent Viceroyship. Amazement,  incredulity, surprise, gave way to congratulations and rejoicings, when  it was found that these were the human drift of the expedition of which  not a whisper, not an echo, had been heard for eight long years.    Then curiosity came rushing in like a flood. Had they seen anything on  the journey? Were there any cities, any peoples worth conquering;  especially did any of them have wealth in gold, silver and precious  stones like that harvested so easily by Cortes and Pizarro?    Cabeza didn't know really, but--, and his long pause and brief story of  seven cities that he had heard of, one or two days' journey to the north  of his track, fired the imagination of the Viceroy and his soldiers of  fortune. To be sure, though, they sent out a party of reconnaissance,  under the control of a good father of the Church, Fray Marcos de Nizza,  a friar of the Orders Minor, commonly known as a Franciscan, with  Stephen, a negro, one of the escaped party of Cabeza de Vaca, as a  guide, to spy out the land.    Fray Marcos penetrated as far as Zuni, and found there the seven cities,  wonderful and strange; though he did not enter them, as the uncurbed  amorous demands of Stephen had led to his death, and Marcos feared lest  a like fate befall himself, but he returned and gave a fairly accurate  account of what he saw. His story was not untruthful, but there are  those who think it was misleading in its pauses and in what he did not  tell. Those pauses and eloquent silences were construed by the vivid  imaginations of his listeners to indicate what the _Conquistadores_  desired, so a grand and glorious expedition was planned, to go forth  with great sound of trumpets, in glad acclaim and glowing colors, led by  his Superior Excellency and Most Nobly Glorious Potentate, Senyor Don  Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, a native of Salamanca, Spain, and now  governor of the Mexican province of New Galicia.    It was a gay throng that started on that wonderful expedition from  Culiacan early in 1540. Their hopes were high, their expectations keen.  Many of them little dreamed of what was before them. Alarcon was sent to  sail up the Sea of Cortes (now the Gulf of California) to keep in touch  with the land expedition, and Melchior Diaz, of that sea party, forced  his way up what is now the Colorado River to the arid sands of the  Colorado Desert in Southern California, before death and disaster  overtook him.    Coronado himself crossed Arizona to Zuni--the pueblo of the Indians that  Fray Marcos had gazed upon from a hill, but had not dared approach--and  took it by storm, receiving a wound in the conflict which laid him up  for a while and made it necessary to send his lieutenant, the Ensign  Pedro de Tobar, to further conquests to the north and west. Hence it was  that Tobar, and not Coronado, discovered the pueblos of the Hopi  Indians. He also sent his sergeant, Cardenas, to report on the stories  told him of a mighty river also to the north, and this explains why  Cardenas was the first white man to behold that eloquent abyss since  known as the Grand Canyon. And because Cardenas was Tobar's subordinate  officer, the high authorities of the Santa Fe Railway--who have yielded  to a common-sense suggestion in the Mission architecture of their  railway stations, and romantic, historic naming of their hotels--have  called their Grand Canyon hotel, _El Tovar_, their hotel at Las Vegas,  _Cardenas_, and the one at Williams (the junction point of the main line  with the Grand Canyon branch), _Fray Marcos._    Poor Coronado, disappointed as to the finding and gaining of great  stores of wealth at Zuni, pushed on even to the eastern boundaries of  Kansas, but found nothing more valuable than great herds of buffalo and  many people, and returned crestfallen, broken-hearted and almost  disgraced by his own sense of failure, to Mexico. And there he drops out  of the story. But others followed him, and in due time this northern  portion of the country was annexed to Spanish possessions and became  known as New Mexico.    In the meantime the missionaries of the Church were active beyond the  conception of our modern minds in the newly conquered Mexican countries.    The various orders of the Roman Catholic Church were indefatigable in  their determination to found cathedrals, churches, missions, convents  and schools. Jesuits, Franciscans and Dominicans vied with each other in  the fervor of their efforts, and Mexico was soon dotted over with  magnificent structures of their erection. Many of the churches of Mexico  are architectural gems of the first water that compare favorably with  the noted cathedrals of Europe, and he who forgets this overlooks one of  the most important factors in Mexican history and civilization.    The period of expansion and enlargement of their political and  ecclesiastical borders continued until, in 1697, Fathers Kino and  Salviaterra, of the Jesuits, with indomitable energy and unquenchable  zeal, started the conversion of the Indians of the peninsula of Lower  California.    In those early days, the name California was not applied, practically  speaking, to the country we know as California. The explorers of Cortes  had discovered what they imagined was an island, but afterwards learned  was a peninsula, and this was soon known as California. In this  California there were many Indians, and it was to missionize these that  the God-fearing, humanity-loving, self-sacrificing Jesuits just  named--not Franciscans--gave of their life, energy and love. The names  of Padres Kino and Salviaterra will long live in the annals of Mission  history for their devotion to the spiritual welfare of the Indians of  Lower California.    The results of their labors were soon seen in that within a few years  fourteen Missions were established, beginning with San Juan Londa in  1697, and the more famous Loreto in 1698.    When the Jesuits were expelled, in 1768, the Franciscans took charge of  the Lower California Missions and established one other, that of San  Fernando de Velicata, besides building a stone chapel in the mining camp  of San Antonio Real, situated near Ventana Bay.    The Dominicans now followed, and the Missions of El Rosario, Santo  Domingo, Descanso, San Vicenti Ferrer, San Miguel Fronteriza, Santo  Tomas de Aquino, San Pedro Martir de Verona, El Mision Fronteriza de  Guadalupe, and finally, Santa Catarina de los Yumas were founded. This  last Mission was established in 1797, and this closed the active epoch  of Mission building in the peninsula, showing twenty-three fairly  flourishing establishments in all.

The judges of such matters are not to ignore what is going on around  them; all necessary knowledge is to be brought into court to discover  what is the universal feeling of nations in respect of right and  wrong, at the time they decide, and if they see a departure from the  past sense of right and wrong, to make the modern, and not the  ancient, the fountain of modern law; thence deducing the modern rules.    Because a precept cannot be found to be settled by the consent or  practice of nations at one time, it is not to be concluded that it  cannot be incorporated into the public code of nations, at some  subsequent period. Nor is it to be admitted, that no precept belongs  to the law of nations which is not _universally_ recognised as such,  by all civilized communities, or even by those constituting what may  be called the Christian states of Europe. Some doctrines, which we, as  well as the United States, admit to belong to the Law of Nations, are  comparatively of recent origin and application, and even at this  period have received no public or general sanction in other nations;  and yet, inasmuch as they are founded on a just view of the duties and  rights of nations, according to a modern universal sense of what is  just, they are enforced here as ascertained laws.[1]    By a similar train of reasoning, not only may the international  tribunals of England enunciate new rules of law, as universal law, if  founded and fairly deduced from ascertained modern, public, and  international opinion; but they may refuse to alter settled rules,  however much opposed by other nations, provided those rules are still  deducible from that origin.    Generally, every doctrine fairly deduced, by correct reasoning, from  the rights and duties of nations, and the nature of moral obligation,  may be said to exist in the Law of Nations. Those rights, duties, and  that moral obligation, are to be ascertained from the enunciation of  them in past times, unless they have been relaxed, waived, or altered  by universal modern opinion.    We may regard, then, the Law of Nations to be a system of political  ethics; not reduced to a written code, but to be sought for, (not  founded,) in the elementary writings of publicists, judicial  precedents, and general usage and practice; but _continually_ open to  change and improvement; as the views of men in general, change or  improve, with regard to the questions--What is right? What is just?    Now to apply the above to one example.    Undoubtedly up to the present time the system of granting Letters of  Marque to the adventurers of a power friendly to the enemy, has  received the sanction of the world. These buccaneering adventurers  have, under the laws of war, when taken, claimed and been allowed the  rights of prisoners of war; have exercised all the privileges of  regular privateers, and cast little or no responsibility on the  countries they issued from, who still claimed to be entitled to the  full position of neutral powers. Yet these unprincipled men differed  from pirates in one respect only--that their infamous warfare was  waged on one unhappy nation alone, instead of against the power of  mankind. Uninfluenced by national feelings, their sole object was the  plunder of the honest trader, and the means to that end--murder. Are  there any modern principles of right and justice by which such persons  are still to claim consideration? That there were such principles  formerly, when the whole system of war was barbaric and unmerciful,  cannot be doubted, unless such enemies were to be condemned when  others equally bad were to be excused; but those reasons have now  disappeared. Universal opinion is against these principles; numerous  treaties have condemned the practice; the municipal laws of several  states have made it punishable in their own subjects; America has even  attempted, in two cases, to bring it in as piracy; and the highest  authorities have pronounced it a crime.    Are not then the foundations of the laws that governed this case  changed? It may be going too far to declare it piracy by the Law of  Nations, but is it asking too much, in calling upon our maritime  tribunals to proclaim the practice contrary to the Law of Nations; to  deprive these privateers of the protection of neutrality, when in  their native waters, and to subject the nation that permits them to  fit out in, or issue from their ports, to the danger of reprisals,  from the offended belligerents.    This I suggest as an example of the application of the principles of  right and wrong, as at present understood, to the investigation of the  continued soundness of an accepted precept of law. In the judgments of  Lord Stowell there are many such examples; and _guided_ as he was by  precedent and authority, he could not be said to have been _led_ by  anything but the principles of universal justice. At no time does he  appear for a moment to have hesitated in putting aside precedent, when  the true doctrine was unsatisfied. Mr. Justice Story acted on the same  plan. The granting of salvage for the recapture of neutral  property--the denial of the right of the Danish Government to  confiscate private debts--the declaration of Mr. Justice Story, that  the slave trade was against the law of nations--are a few amongst many  remarkable examples of the fundamental principle being allowed to  alter and overrule the authoritative precept.          THE LAWS OF WAR.        PART I.        THE LAWS OF WAR AFFECTING COMMERCE AND SHIPPING.        CHAPTER I. COMMENCEMENT OF WAR.        SECTION I.        _The Immediate Effects of War_.      For some months the state of war that has been impending between  Russia, and the Allied Powers,--England, France, and Turkey,--has now  become actual; and though there have been many acts of preparation and  precaution on the part of England and France, we have not been, up to  the present crisis, engaged in what is termed by international  writers, Public and Solemn War; such a position of affairs has at last  arrived.    [Sidenote: Solemn War.]    The War then, that England has entered into, is of the most Public and  Solemn kind. Public War is divided into Perfect and Imperfect. The  former is more usually called Solemn. Grotius defines Public or Solemn  War to be such Public War as is declared or proclaimed.    Imperfect Wars between nations, that is such wars as nations carry on  one against the other, without declaring or proclaiming them, though  they are Public Wars, are seldom called wars at all; they are more  usually known by the name of reprisals, or acts of hostility. It has  often been important to determine, on the re-settlement of peace, what  time war commenced, and when reprisals ceased.[2]    According to the Law of Nations, two things are required for a Solemn  War; first, it must be a Public War; that is, the contending parties  must be two nations, or two parties of allied nations, contending by  force under the direction of a supreme executive; and secondly, it  must be proclaimed, notified, or declared. And probably it must be  general in its character, and not simply local or defensive. Presuming  that the coming contest will be of the widest character, I shall  proceed to examine its legal effects on Commerce, on that  supposition.[3]    [Sidenote: Declaration of War]    Declarations have existed from the most ancient times, having been  borrowed by modern nations from the manners and customs of the Romans.  But in present times, (although they may be very properly put  forward,) they are not necessary to a state of actual war, or as it is  technically termed, to legalize hostilities. A Declaration of War is  not a matter of international right.[4] Acts of hostilities, without  such an instrument, cannot be denounced as irregular or piratical,  unless committed in manifest bad faith. But though war may lawfully  commence without an actual declaration, yet a declaration is of  sufficient force to create a state of war, without any mutual attack.  It is not a mere challenge from one country to another, to be accepted  or refused at pleasure by the other. It proves the existence of actual  hostilities on one side at least, and puts the other party also in a  state of war, though, he may, perhaps, think proper to act on the  defensive only.[5]    [Sidenote: War, how commenced.]    War now generally commences by Actual Hostilities, by the Recal or  Dismissal of an Ambassador or Minister, or by a Manifesto published by  one belligerent power to its own subjects.    Manifestoes are issued to fix the date of the commencement of  hostilities; for as a state of war has many various effects on  commercial transactions, such as the confiscation of certain property,  and the dissolution of certain contracts, it is very necessary that  such a date should be accurately known. When a Manifesto or  Declaration is issued, it is said to legalize hostilities, that is to  say,--to make all acts done, and all breaches committed, under  pressure of war, good and lawful acts and breaches.    I have given this explanation, because it is a popular notion that a  declaration always precedes war; but in reality, in modern times, few  wars are solemnly declared;--they begin most often with general  hostilities; thus the first Dutch War began upon general Letters of  Marque, and the War with Spain, that commenced by the attempted  invasion of the Armada in 1588, was not declared or proclaimed between  the two crowns.[6]    [Sidenote: Contents of Declaration.]    The Manifesto not only announces the commencement Contents of and  existence of hostilities, but also states the reasons of, and attempts  the justification of the war; and it is necessary for the instruction  and direction of the subjects of the belligerent state, with respect  to their intercourse with the foe; it also apprizes neutral nations of  the fact, and enables them to conform their"]]]
