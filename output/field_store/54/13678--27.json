To the  moralists, the fact that the moral standards of society in Lord  Chesterfield's day were very different from those of the present era  rather adds to the odium that has become associated with his attitude. His  severest critics, however, do concede that he is candid and outspoken, and  many admit that his social strategy is widely practised even in these  days.    But the aims of the world in which he moved were routed by the onrush of  the ideals of democratic equality, fraternity, and liberty. With the  prosperity of the newer shibboleths, the old-time notion of aristocracy,  gentility, and high breeding became more and more a curio to be framed  suitably in gold and kept in the glass case of an art museum. The crashing  advance of the industrial age of gold thrust all courts and their sinuous  graces aside for the unmistakable ledger balance of the counting-house.  This new order of things had been a long time in process, when, in the  first year of this century, a distinguished English social historian, the  late The Right Honorable G.W.E. Russell, wrote: \"Probably in all ages of  history men have liked money, but a hundred years ago they did not talk  about it in society.... Birth, breeding, rank, accomplishments, eminence  in literature, eminence in art, eminence in public service--all these  things still count for something in society. But when combined they are  only as the dust of the balance when weighed against the all-prevalent  power of money. The worship of the Golden Calf is the characteristic cult  of modern society.\" In the Elizabethan Age of mighty glory, three hundred  years before this was said, Ben Jonson had railed against money as \"a thin  membrane of honor,\" groaning: \"How hath all true reputation fallen since  money began to have any!\" Now the very fact that the debasing effect of  money on the social organism has been so constantly reprehended, from  Scriptural days onward, proves the instinctive yearning of mankind for a  system of life regulated by good taste, high intelligence and sound  affections. But, it remains true that, in the succession of great  commercial epochs, coincident with the progress of modern science and  invention, _almost_ everything can be bought and sold, and so _almost_  everything is rated by the standard of money.    Yet, this standard is precisely not the ultimate test of the Christianity  on which we have been pluming ourselves through the centuries. Still, no  one can get along without money; and few of us get along very well with  what we have. At least we think so--because everybody else seems to think  that way. We Americans are members of the nation which, materially, is  the richest, most prosperous and most promising in the world. This idea is  dinned into our heads continually by foreign observers, and publicly we  \"own the soft impeachment.\" Privately, each individual American seems  driven with the decision that he must live up to the general conception of  the nation as a whole. And he does, but in less strenuous moments he might  profitably ponder the counsel of Gladstone to his countrymen: \"Let us  respect the ancient manners and recollect that, if the true soul of  chivalry has died among us, with it all that is good in society has died.  Let us cherish a sober mind; take for granted that in our best  performances there are latent many errors which in their own time will  come to light.\"    America, too, has her ancient manners to remember and respect; but, in the  rapid assimilation of new peoples into her economic and social organism,  more pressing concerns take up nearly all her time. The perfection of  manners by intensive cultivation of good taste, some believe, would be the  greatest aid possible to the moralists who are alarmed over the decadence  of the younger generation. Good taste may not make men or women really  virtuous, but it will often save them from what theologians call  \"occasions of sin.\" We may note, too, that grossness in manners forms a  large proportion of the offenses that fanatical reformers foam about.  Besides grossness, there is also the meaner selfishness. Selfishness is at  the polar remove from the worldly manners of the old school, according to  which, as Dr. Pusey wrote, others were preferred to self, pain was given  to no one, no one was neglected, deference was shown to the weak and the  aged, and unconscious courtesy extended to all inferiors. Such was the  \"beauty\" of the old manners, which he felt consisted in \"acting upon  Christian principle, and if in any case it became soulless, as apart from  Christianity, the beautiful form was there, into which the real life might  re-enter.\"    As a study of all that is admirable in American manners, and as a guide to  behavior in the simplest as well as the most complex requirements of life  day by day, whether we are at home or away from it, there can be no  happier choice than the present volume. It is conceived in the belief that  etiquette in its broader sense means the technique of human conduct under  all circumstances in life. Yet all minutiae of correct manners are included  and no detail is too small to be explained, from the selection of a  visiting card to the mystery of eating corn on the cob. Matters of clothes  for men and women are treated with the same fullness of information and  accuracy of taste as are questions of the furnishing of their houses and  the training of their minds to social intercourse. But there is no  exaggeration of the minor details at the expense of the more important  spirit of personal conduct and attitude of mind. To dwell on formal  trivialities, the author holds, is like \"measuring the letters of the  sign-boards by the roadside instead of profiting by the directions they  offer.\" She would have us know also that \"it is not the people who make  small technical mistakes or even blunders, who are barred from the paths  of good society, but those of sham and pretense whose veneered vulgarity  at every step tramples the flowers in the gardens of cultivation.\" To her  mind the structure of etiquette is comparable to that of a house, of which  the foundation is ethics and the rest good taste, correct speech, quiet,  unassuming behavior, and a proper pride of dignity.    To such as entertain the mistaken notion that politeness implies all give  and little or no return, it is well to recall Coleridge's definition of a  gentleman: \"We feel the gentlemanly character present with us,\" he said,  \"whenever, under all circumstances of social intercourse, the trivial, not  less than the important, through the whole detail of his manners and  deportment, and with the ease of a habit, a person shows respect to others  in such a way as at the same time implies, in his own feelings, and  habitually, an assured anticipation of reciprocal respect from them to  himself. In short, the gentlemanly character arises out of the feeling of  equality acting as a habit, yet flexible to the varieties of rank, and  modified without being disturbed or superseded by them.\" Definitions of a  gentleman are numerous, and some of them famous; but we do not find such  copiousness for choice in definitions of a lady. Perhaps it has been  understood all along that the admirable and just characteristics of a  gentleman should of necessity be those also of a lady, with the charm of  womanhood combined. And, in these days, with the added responsibility of  the vote.    Besides the significance of this volume as an indubitable authority on  manners, it should be pointed out that as a social document, it is without  precedent in American literature. In order that we may better realize the  behavior and environment of well-bred people, the distinguished author has  introduced actual persons and places in fictional guise. They are the  persons and the places of her own world; and whether we can or can not  penetrate the incognito of the Worldlys, the Gildings, the Kindharts, the  Oldnames, and the others, is of no importance. Fictionally, they are real  enough for us to be interested and instructed in their way of living. That  they happen to move in what is known as Society is incidental, for, as the  author declares at the very outset: \"Best Society is not a fellowship of  the wealthy, nor does it seek to exclude those who are not of exalted  birth; but it is an association of gentlefolk, of which good form in  speech, charm of manner, knowledge of the social amenities, and  instinctive consideration for the feelings of others, are the credentials  by which society the world over recognizes its chosen members.\"    The immediate fact is that the characters of this book are thoroughbred  Americans, representative of various sections of the country and free from  the slightest tinge of snobbery. Not all of them are even well-to-do, in  the postwar sense; and their devices of economy in household outlay, dress  and entertainment are a revelation in the science of ways and means. There  are parents, children, relatives and friends all passing before us in the  pageant of life from the cradle to the grave. No circumstance, from an  introduction to a wedding, is overlooked in this panorama and the  spectator has beside him a cicerone in the person of the author who clears  every doubt and answers every question. In course, the conviction grows  upon him that etiquette is no flummery of poseurs \"aping the manners of  their betters,\" nor a code of snobs, who divide their time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#2)"],[1,"done, and unless  something turns up mighty quick I shall clear out.\"    \"For good?\"    \"I don't count on being a ghost nor yet an angel,\" Hamar said; \"when  we've done here, I reckon we've done altogether!\"    \"I shouldn't have thought suicide was in your line,\" Curtis remarked.  \"More Matt's. I should have credited you with something more  original.\"    \"Original!\" Hamar snarled. \"I defy any man to be original when he  hasn't a cent, and his stomach contains nothing but air. Give me  money, give me food--then, perhaps, I'll be original.\"    \"You don't mean to say you're cleared out of grub!\" Kelson and Curtis  cried in chorus. \"We've come to you as our last hope. We've neither of  us tasted anything since yesterday.\"    \"Then you'll taste nothing again to-day--at least as far as I'm  concerned,\" Hamar jeered. \"I tell you I'm broke--haven't as much as a  crumb in the room; and I've pawned everything, save the clothes you  see me in!\"    \"And yet you can buy books--unless--unless you stole it!\" Curtis said,  eyeing with suspicion the volume Hamar had thrown on the table.    \"Buy it! Not much!\" Hamar cried quickly. \"It's one I've had all my  life. Belonged to my grandfather. I took it with me to-night to see  what I could raise on it.\"    \"And no one would have it? I should guess not,\" Kelson said, drawing  it towards him. \"Why it's got a new label inside--S. Leipman! I know  him. He's slick even for a Jew. This looks as if it belonged to your  grandfather, Leon. If I'm not real mistaken you bought the book  to-night. There's something in it you thought you could make capital  of. Trust you for that. Now I wonder what it was!\"    \"You're welcome to see!\" Hamar sneered. \"Perhaps you'd like some  water!\"    \"Water! Why water?\"    \"Well, instead of tea or whisky to help digest the book. Besides, it's  the only thing I have to offer you.\"    \"Look here, Leon,\" Curtis interrupted; \"what's the good of behaving  like this? We are all in the same boat--starving--desperate. So let us  lay our heads together and see if we can't think of something--some  way out of it.\"    \"A Burglary Company Limited, for instance!\" Hamar sneered. \"No! I'm  not having any. I've neither tools nor experience. The San Francisco  police handle one roughly, so I'm told, and hard labour isn't to my  liking.\"    \"There are other things besides burglary!\" Curtis said in tones of  annoyance. \"We might work a fake.\"    \"If I work anything of that sort,\" Hamar said hastily, \"I work alone.  Think of something else.\"    \"I tell you Matt and I are pretty well desperate,\" Curtis cried, \"and  if we don't think of something soon, we shan't be able to think at  all. We've tried our level best to get work--we've answered every  likely and unlikely advertisement in the papers--and all to no  purpose. So if Providence won't help us we must help ourselves.  Robbery, burglary, fakes, anything short of murder--it's all the same  to us now--we're tired of starving--dead sick of it. We would do  anything, sell our very souls for a meal. My God! I never imagined how  terrible it is to feel so hungry. You appear to be interested, Matt.  What is it?\"    \"Why, look here, you fellows!\" Kelson said slowly. \"This book is all  about a place called Atlantis that is said to have existed in the  Atlantic Ocean between America and Ireland, and to have been deluged  by an earthquake owing to the wickedness of its inhabitants. They  practised sorcery.\"    \"Practised foolery,\" Hamar said. \"It's tosh--all tosh! Wickedness is  only a matter of climate--and there's no such thing as sorcery.\"    \"So I thought,\" Kelson replied; \"but I'm not so sure now. The author  of this book writes darned sensibly, and is apparently at no loss for  corroborative testimony. He was a professor too. See! Thomas Henry  Maitland, at one time Professor of English at the University of Basle  in Switzerland. There's an asterisk against his name and a footnote in  very old-fashioned handwriting--the 's's' are all 'f's,' and half the  letters capitals. Listen--        \"'Thomas Maitland, despite the remonstrances of his friends,      visited Spain. By order of the Holy Inquisition he was arrested,      May 5, 1693, on a charge of practising sorcery, and burned alive      at the Auto da Fe, in the Grand Market Square, Madrid; having in      the interim been subjected to such tortures as only the subtle      brains of the hellish inquisitors could devise. On receipt of a      message from him, delivered in his supernatural body, we attended      his execution, and can readily testify that he suffered no pain,      although the torments endured by those around him were pitiable to      behold.        \"(Signed) GEORGE RICHARD POOL, Physician; and ROBERT JAMES FOX,      Merchant.        \"Citizens of Boston, Massachusetts; August 1, 1693.'\"    \"Rot!\" Hamar said savagely; \"don't waste time reading such bunkum.\"    \"It may be bunkum, but if it takes away his mind from his stomach let  him go on,\" Curtis interposed. \"It's very obvious you haven't arrived  at our pitch of starvation yet, Leon, or you would welcome anything  that would make you forget it even for a moment. Let's hear some more,  Matt! Go on, tell us something. How to make coyottes out of paraffin  paint, or convert a Sunday pair of pants into a glistening harem  skirt! Anything that won't remind us of food.\"    Thus encouraged Kelson slowly turned over the pages of the book. \"I  see it was printed and published for--I presume that means by--A.  Bettesworth and J. Batley in Pater-noster-Row, London, England, in  1690. Basle, London, Boston, Madrid! The author seems to have had  wandering on the brain. By the bye, Leon, with your features you could  easily work off a fake as 'the Wandering Jew.' There's money in  it--people will swallow anything in that line now.\"    \"I don't see how it would profit you anyhow,\" Hamar snarled. \"Leave my  features alone and go on with your reading.\"    Kelson chuckled--here was one way at least in which he could  occasionally get even with Hamar. Hamar's features were Yiddish, and  the Yids were none too popular in California.    \"Oh, all right!\" he said; \"if the subject is so painful I'll try and  avoid it in future; but it's odd how some things--for instance, murder  and noses--will out. Let me see, what have we here? 'Discovery of  ancient books, manuscripts, etc., relating to Atlantis.' Apparently,  Thomas Maitland, when shipwrecked on an island, called Inisturk, off  Mayo, in Ireland, found a wooden chest of rare workmanship--he had  seen, he says, similar ones in Egypt and Yucatan--containing some very  ancient books--curiously bound, and some vellum manuscripts, which,  after an infinite amount of labour, he managed to translate. The  books, he says, were standard histories, biographies, and scientific  works on occultism--all published in Banchicheisi, the capital of  Atlantis--and the manuscripts, he affirms, had been transcribed by one  Coulmenes, who believed himself to be the only survivor of a  tremendous submarine earthquake that had destroyed the whole of  Atlantis. The manuscripts included a diary of the events leading up to  the catastrophe--even to the meals! How about this?--'Sunrise on the  day of Thottirnanoge in the month of Finn-ra. Breakfasted on cornsop,  fish (Semona, corresponding to salmon), fruit, and much sweet milk.'\"    \"For God's sake, don't!\" Curtis groaned. \"Skip over that part. The  very mention of grub makes the gnawing pain in my stomach ten times  worse.\"    \"You're different to me then!\" Hamar grinned; \"I love to think of it.  My word, what wouldn't I give to be in Sadler's now. Roast beef--done  to a turn, eh! As only Sadler knows how! Potatoes nice and brown and  crisp! Horseradish! Greens! Boiled celery! Pudding under the meat!  Beer!--What, going?\"    Curtis had risen from the table with his fingers crammed in his ears.  \"There's a fat splice of the devil in you to-night, Leon!\" he panted.  \"I've had enough of it. I'm off. Come on, Matt. If you want us, you  know where to find us--only if we don't get something to eat  soon--you'll find us dead.\"          CHAPTER II    THE BLACK ART OF ATLANTIS      For some time after Kelson and Curtis had left him, Hamar lolled back  in his seat, lost in thought. Thought, as he told himself repeatedly,  should be the poor man's chief recreation--it costs nothing: and if  one wants a little variety, and the walls of one's rooms are tolerably  thick, one can think aloud. Hamar often did, and derived much  enjoyment from it.    \"I'm convinced of one thing,\" he suddenly broke out; \"I'd rather be  hungry than cold. One can, in a measure, cheat one's stomach by  chewing leather or sucking pebbles, but I'll be hanged if one can kid  one's liver. It's cold that does me! A touch of cold on the liver! I  could jog along comfortably on few dollars for food--but it's a fire,  a fire I want! The temperature of this room is infernally low after  sunset: and half a dozen coats and three pairs of pants don't make  up for half a grateful of fuel. Hunger only makes me think of  suicide--but cold--cold and a chilled liver--makes me think of crime.  Yes, it's cold! Cold that would make me a criminal. I would  steal--burgle--housebreak--cut the sweetest lady's throat in  Christendom--for a fire!    \"There! that little outbreak has relieved me. Now let me have a look  at the book.\"    He dragged the volume towards him, and despite the feeling of  antagonism with which it had inspired him, and despite the cynical  attitude he had, up to the present, adopted towards the supernatural,  he speedily became engrossed. On a few leaves, somewhat clumsily  inserted between the cover and first page of the book, Hamar read an  account, presumably in the author's own penmanship, of how he, Thomas  Maitland, after being shipwrecked, had remained on Inisturk Island for  a fortnight before being rescued, and had spent the greater portion of  that time in examining the books,"]]]
