As a whole, there is inevitably something of sameness in the work, and  the subject is unequal to its long expansion; yet its nature is such,  there is so much of looseness in the plan, that it might have been  doubled or trebled without incongruity. It is one of those books  which depend upon individual will and feeling, rather than upon a  broad subject founded in nature and tractable by the largest laws of  art. Hence, though not irrespective of laws, such works depend upon  instinctive felicity--felicity in the choice of topics and the mode  of execution, felicity both in doing and in leaving undone: this high  and perfect excellence, perhaps, _In Memoriam_ has not reached, though  omission and revision might lead very close to it.\"    [Footnote 1: _In Memoriam.

One of the most delightful books of the season will be _The  Autobiography of LEIGH HUNT_, which is being reprinted by Harper &  Brothers, and will very soon be given to the American public in  an edition of suitable elegance. The last great race of poets and  literary men, observes a writer in the London _Standard_, is now  rapidly vanishing from the scene: of the splendid constellation, in  the midst of which Campbell, Scott, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley,  Southey, Crabbe, and Byron, were conspicuous, how few remain! Moore  (rapidly declining), Rogers (upward of eighty), Professor Wilson,  Montgomery, and Leigh Hunt, are nearly all. It is fitting that we  prize these few, as the remnants of a magnificent group, which cannot  be expected very soon to be repeated.    Leigh Hunt has, for nearly half a century, occupied a prominent place  in the public eye, as a politician of a peculiarly bold and decided  stamp, when boldness was necessary for the utterance of the truth;  and as a poet and prose-writer of a singularly-genial and amiable  character. As the chief founder and critic of the _Examiner_, he would  doubtless occupy a high place in literary history, but as the author  of \"Rimini\" he is entitled to a more enduring and enviable fame. This  will always stand at the head of his works: but his \"Indicator,\" his  \"London Journal,\" his \"Jar of Honey,\" and others, abound with the  illustrations of a most imaginative and cordial spirit.    We are glad to possess a good autobiography of Leigh Hunt. It is the  first we have from a long list of celebrated men; and no one could  give us such correct, discerning, and delightful insights into their  usual life and true characters. Hazlitt, Lamb, Shelley, Keats, Byron,  and a crowd of others become familiar to us in these pages. It was in  the _Examiner_ that the first compositions of Shelley and Keats were  introduced to the British public; and the friendship which Mr. Hunt  maintained with those poets, till their deaths, casts a sunshine over  that portion of his life, which is peculiarly charming.    Perhaps the two points of this Autobiography which will most attract  the attention of the reader are the author's imprisonment for a libel  on the Prince Regent, and his visit to Italy. In that imprisonment  of two years, he was visited by Byron, Moore, Brougham, Bentham,  and several other eminent men. In the journey to Italy, which was  undertaken in order to cooeperate with Byron and Shelley in bringing  out of the \"Liberal,\" Hunt had the misfortune to be deprived of  Shelley's friendship, by death, immediately on his arrival; and of  the friendship of Byron, through incompatibilities of taste, and the  jealous officiousness of Byron's friends, amongst whom Moore bore a  prominent part. Mr. Hunt published a volume on the subject soon after  his return to England, which occasioned him a great deal of ill-will.  To this publication he now refers with expressions of much regret, and  with the calmness which has been produced by time. But it cannot be  denied that he endured most mortifying and irritating provocations,  which never could have taken place had Shelley lived. We are glad that  he has had an opportunity of leaving a generous and forgiving record  of this remarkable portion of his life; and certainly nothing can be  more delightful than his present account of it:--        \"The greatest comfort I experienced,\" he says, \"in Italy      was living in the same neighborhood, and thinking, as I went      about, of Boccaccio. Boccaccio's father had a house at Maiano,      supposed to have been situated at the Fiesolan extremity of      the hamlet. That merry-hearted writer was so fond of the place      that he has not only laid the two scenes of the 'Decameron' on      each side of it, with the valley which his company resorted      to in the middle, but has made the two little streams which      embrace Maiano, the Affrico and the Mensola, the hero and the      heroine of his 'Nimphale Fiesolano.' The scene of another of      his works is on the banks of the Margnone, a river a little      distant; and the 'Decameron' is full of the neighboring      villages. Out of the windows of one side of our house we saw      the turret of the Villa Gherardi, to which, according to      his biographers, his 'joyous company' resorted in the first      instance. A house belonging to the Macchiavelli was near, a      little to the left; and farther to the left, among the blue      hills, was the white village, Settignano, where Michael Angelo      was born. The house is still in possession of the family. From      our windows on the other side we saw, close to us, the Fiesole      of antiquity and of Milton, the site of the Boccaccio-house      before mentioned; still closer, the _Decameron's_ Valley of      Ladies at our feet; and we looked over toward the quarter      of the Mignone and of a house of Dante, and in the distance      beheld the mountains of Pistria. Lastly, from the terrace in      front, Florence lay clear and cathedraled before us, with the      scene of Redi's _Bacchus_ rising on the other side of it, and      the villa of Arcetri, famous for Galileo. Hazlitt, who came to      see me there, beheld the scene around us with the admiration      natural to a lover of old folios and great names, and      confessed, in the language of Burns, that it was a sight to      enrich the eyes.        \"My daily walk was to Fiesole, through a path skirted with      wild myrtle and cyclamen; and I stopped at the door of the      Doccia, and sate on the pretty melancholy platform behind it,      reading, or looking down to Florence.\"    This is all very charming, yet hear what the author says further:--        \"Some people, when they return from Italy, say it has no wood,      and some a great deal. The fact is, that many parts of it,      Tuscany included, has no wood to _speak of_: it wants larger      trees interspersed with the small ones, in the manner of our      hedge-row elms. A tree of a reasonable height is a god-send.      The olives are low and hazy-looking, like dry sallows. You      have plenty of these; but to an Englishman, looking from a      height, they appear little better than brushwood. Then there      are no meadows, no proper green fields in June; nothing of      that luxurious combination of green and russet, of grass, wild      flowers, and woods, over which a lover of nature can stroll      for hours, with a foot as fresh as the stag's; unmixed with      chalk-dust, and an eternal public path, and able to lie down,      if he will, and sleep in clover. In short--saving, alas! a      finer sky and a drier atmosphere--we have the best part of      Italy in books; and this we can enjoy in England. Give me      Tuscany in Middlesex or Berkshire, and the Valley of Ladies      between Jack Straw's Castle and Harrow.... To me, Italy had a      certain hard taste in the mouth: its mountains were too bare,      its outlines too sharp, its lanes too stony, its voices too      loud, its long summer too dusty. I longed to bathe myself in      the grassy balm of my native fields.\"    As a whole these volumes are full of interest and variety. They  introduce us to numerous famous people, and leave us with a most  agreeable impression of their author.           *       *       *       *       *    THE MORMONS.    THOMAS L. KANE, of Philadelphia, distinguished himself very honorably  a year or two ago by the vindication of the Mormons against calumnies  to which they had been subjected in the Western States, and by  appeals for their relief from the sufferings induced by unlooked-for  exposure in their exodus to California. We are indebted to him for  an interesting discourse upon the subject, delivered before the  Historical Society of Pennsylvania. He concludes this performance with  the following observations, which we believe to be altogether just.  Mr. KANE is a man of sagacity and integrity, and his opportunities for  the formation of a wise opinion upon this subject were such as very  few have possessed:        \"I have gone over the work I assigned myself when I accepted      your Committee's invitation, as fully as I could do without      trespassing too largely upon your courteous patience. But I      should do wrong to conclude my lecture without declaring in      succinct and definite terms, the opinions I have formed and      entertain of the Mormon people. The libels, of which they      have been made the subject, make this a simple act of justice.

His boots were white with it. His  overalls were gray with it. The weather-beaten bloom of his face shone  through it duskily, as the ripe peaches look upon their trees in a dry  season. But no dinginess of travel or shabbiness of attire could tarnish  the splendor that radiated from his youth and strength. The old man  upon whose temper his remarks were doing such deadly work was combed and  curried to a finish, a bridegroom swept and garnished; but alas for age!  Had I been the bride, I should have taken the giant, dust and all. He  had by no means done with the old man.    \"Why, yu've hung weddin' gyarments on every limb!\" he now drawled, with  admiration. \"Who is the lucky lady this trip?\"    The old man seemed to vibrate. \"Tell you there ain't been no other! Call  me a Mormon, would you?\"    \"Why, that--\"    \"Call me a Mormon? Then name some of my wives. Name two. Name one. Dare  you!\"    \"--that Laramie wido' promised you--'    \"Shucks!\"    \"--only her doctor suddenly ordered Southern climate and--\"    \"Shucks! You're a false alarm.\"    \"--so nothing but her lungs came between you. And next you'd most got  united with Cattle Kate, only--\"    \"Tell you you're a false alarm!\"    \"--only she got hung.\"    \"Where's the wives in all this? Show the wives! Come now!\"    \"That corn-fed biscuit-shooter at Rawlins yu' gave the canary--\"    \"Never married her. Never did marry--\"    \"But yu' come so near, uncle! She was the one left yu' that letter  explaining how she'd got married to a young cyard-player the very day  before her ceremony with you was due, and--\"    \"Oh, you're nothing; you're a kid; you don't amount to--\"    \"--and how she'd never, never forgot to feed the canary.\"    \"This country's getting full of kids,\" stated the old man, witheringly.  \"It's doomed.\" This crushing assertion plainly satisfied him. And he  blinked his eyes with renewed anticipation. His tall tormentor continued  with a face of unchanging gravity, and a voice of gentle solicitude:  \"How is the health of that unfortunate--\"    \"That's right! Pour your insults! Pour 'em on a sick, afflicted woman!\"  The eyes blinked with combative relish.    \"Insults? Oh, no, Uncle Hughey!\"    \"That's all right! Insults goes!\"    \"Why, I was mighty relieved when she began to recover her mem'ry. Las'  time I heard, they told me she'd got it pretty near all back. Remembered  her father, and her mother, and her sisters and brothers, and her  friends, and her happy childhood, and all her doin's except only your  face. The boys was bettin' she'd get that far too, give her time. But  I reckon afteh such a turrable sickness as she had, that would be  expectin' most too much.\"    At this Uncle Hughey jerked out a small parcel. \"Shows how much you  know!\" he cackled. \"There! See that! That's my ring she sent me back,  being too unstrung for marriage. So she don't remember me, don't she?  Ha-ha! Always said you were a false alarm.\"    The Southerner put more anxiety into his tone. \"And so you're a-takin'  the ring right on to the next one!\" he exclaimed. \"Oh, don't go to get  married again, Uncle Hughey! What's the use o' being married?\"    \"What's the use?\" echoed the bridegroom, with scorn. \"Hm! When you grow  up you'll think different.\"    \"Course I expect to think different when my age is different. I'm havin'  the thoughts proper to twenty-four, and you're havin' the thoughts  proper to sixty.\"    \"Fifty!\" shrieked Uncle Hughey, jumping in the air.    The Southerner took a tone of self-reproach. \"Now, how could I forget  you was fifty,\" he murmured, \"when you have been telling it to the boys  so careful for the last ten years!\"    Have you ever seen a cockatoo--the white kind with the top-knot--enraged  by insult? The bird erects every available feather upon its person.  So did Uncle Hughey seem to swell, clothes, mustache, and woolly white  beard; and without further speech he took himself on board the Eastbound  train, which now arrived from its siding in time to deliver him.    Yet this was not why he had not gone away before. At any time he could  have escaped into the baggage-room or withdrawn to a dignified distance  until his train should come up. But the old man had evidently got a sort  of joy from this teasing. He had reached that inevitable age when we are  tickled to be linked with affairs of gallantry, no matter how.    With him now the Eastbound departed slowly into that distance whence  I had come. I stared after it as it went its way to the far shores of  civilization. It grew small in the unending gulf of space, until all  sign of its presence was gone save a faint skein of smoke against the  evening sky. And now my lost trunk came back into my thoughts, and  Medicine Bow seemed a lonely spot. A sort of ship had left me marooned  in a foreign ocean; the Pullman was comfortably steaming home to port,  while I--how was I to find Judge Henry's ranch? Where in this unfeatured  wilderness was Sunk Creek? No creek or any water at all flowed here that  I could perceive. My host had written he should meet me at the station  and drive me to his ranch. This was all that I knew. He was not here.  The baggage-man had not seen him lately. The ranch was almost certain  to be too far to walk to, to-night. My trunk--I discovered myself still  staring dolefully after the vanished East-bound; and at the same instant  I became aware that the tall man was looking gravely at me,--as  gravely as he had looked at Uncle Hughey throughout their remarkable  conversation.    To see his eye thus fixing me and his thumb still hooked in his  cartridge-belt, certain tales of travellers from these parts forced  themselves disquietingly into my recollection. Now that Uncle Hughey was  gone, was I to take his place and be, for instance, invited to dance on  the platform to the music of shots nicely aimed?    \"I reckon I am looking for you, seh,\" the tall man now observed.          II. \"WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT, SMILE!\"      We cannot see ourselves as others see us, or I should know what  appearance I cut at hearing this from the tall man. I said nothing,  feeling uncertain.    \"I reckon I am looking for you, seh,\" he repeated politely.    \"I am looking for Judge Henry,\" I now replied.    He walked toward me, and I saw that in inches he was not a giant. He was  not more than six feet. It was Uncle Hughey that had made him seem to  tower. But in his eye, in his face, in his step, in the whole man,  there dominated a something potent to be felt, I should think, by man or  woman.    \"The Judge sent me afteh you, seh,\" he now explained, in his civil  Southern voice; and he handed me a letter from my host. Had I not  witnessed his facetious performances with Uncle Hughey, I should have  judged him wholly ungifted with such powers. There was nothing external  about him but what seemed the signs of a nature as grave as you could  meet. But I had witnessed; and therefore supposing that I knew him in  spite of his appearance, that I was, so to speak, in his secret and  could give him a sort of wink, I adopted at once a method of easiness.  It was so pleasant to be easy with a large stranger, who instead of  shooting at your heels had very civilly handed you a letter.    \"You're from old Virginia, I take it?\" I began.    He answered slowly, \"Then you have taken it correct, seh.\"    A slight chill passed over my easiness, but I went cheerily on with a  further inquiry. \"Find many oddities out here like Uncle Hughey?\"    \"Yes, seh, there is a right smart of oddities around. They come in on  every train.\"    At this point I dropped my method of easiness.    \"I wish that trunks came on the train,\" said I. And I told him my  predicament.    It was not to be expected that he would be greatly moved at my loss; but  he took it with no comment whatever. \"We'll wait in town for it,\" said  he, always perfectly civil.    Now, what I had seen of \"town\" was, to my newly arrived eyes, altogether  horrible. If I could possibly sleep at the Judge's ranch, I preferred to  do so.    \"Is it too far to drive there to-night?\" I inquired.    He looked at me in a puzzled manner.    \"For this valise,\" I explained, \"contains all that I immediately need;  in fact, I could do without my trunk for a day or two, if it is not  convenient to send. So if we could arrive there not too late by starting  at once--\" I paused.    \"It's two hundred and sixty-three miles,\" said the Virginian.    To my loud ejaculation he made no answer, but surveyed me a moment  longer, and then said, \"Supper will be about ready now.\" He took my  valise, and I followed his steps toward the eating-house in silence. I  was dazed.    As we went, I read my host's letter--a brief hospitable message. He was  very sorry not to meet me himself. He had been getting ready to drive  over, when the surveyor appeared and detained him. Therefore in his  stead he was sending a trustworthy man to town, who would look after  me and drive me over. They were looking forward to my visit with much  pleasure. This was all.    Yes, I was dazed. How did they count distance in this country? You spoke  in a neighborly fashion about driving over to town, and it meant--I  did not know yet how many days. And what would be meant by the term  \"dropping in,\" I wondered. And how many miles would be considered really  far? I abstained from further questioning the \"trustworthy man.\" My  questions had not fared excessively well. He did not propose making me  dance, to be sure: that would scarcely be trustworthy. But neither did  he propose to have me familiar with him. Why was this? What had I done  to elicit that veiled and skilful sarcasm about oddities coming in on  every train? Having been sent to look after me, he would do so,  would even carry my valise; but I could not be jocular with him. This  handsome, ungrammatical son of the soil had set between us the bar of  his cold and perfect"]]]
