I  cannot tell; but I feel to this day just as I felt to the innermost depths  of my heart in the days of my youth when I first heard a symphony of  Beethoven's,--that a spirit breathes from it bearing us aloft with giant  power out of the oppressive atmosphere of sense, stirring to its inmost  recesses the heart of man, bringing him to the full consciousness of his  loftier being, and of the undying within him. And even more distinctly than  when a new world was thus disclosed to his youthful feelings is the _man_  fully conscious that not only was this a new world to him, but a new world  of feeling in itself, revealing to the spirit phases of its own, which,  till Beethoven appeared, had never before been fathomed. Call it by what  name you will, when one of the great works of the sublime master is heard,  whether indicative of proud self-consciousness, freedom, spring, love,  storm, or battle, it grasps the soul with singular force, and enlarges the  laboring breast. Whether a man understands music or not, every one who has  a heart beating within his breast will feel with enchantment that here is  concentrated the utmost promised to us by the most imaginative of our  poets, in bright visions of happiness and freedom. Even the only great hero  of action, who in those memorable days is worthy to stand beside the great  master of harmony, having diffused among mankind new and priceless earthly  treasures, sinks in the scale when we compare these with the celestial  treasures of a purified and deeper feeling, and a more free, enlarged, and  sublime view of the world, struggling gradually and distinctly upwards out  of the mere frivolity of an art devoid of words to express itself, and  impressing its stamp on the spirit of the age. They convey, too, the  knowledge of this brightest victory of genuine German intellect to those  for whom the sweet Muse of Music is as a book with seven seals, and reveal,  likewise, a more profound sense of Beethoven's being to many who already,  through the sweet tones they have imbibed, enjoy some dawning conviction of  the master's grandeur, and who now more and more eagerly lend a listening  ear to the intellectual clearly worded strains so skilfully interwoven,  thus soon to arrive at the full and blissful comprehension of those grand  outpourings of the spirit, and finally to add another bright delight to the  enjoyment of those who already know and love Beethoven. All these may be  regarded as the objects I had in view when I undertook to edit his Letters,  which have also bestowed on myself the best recompense of my labors, in the  humble conviction that by this means I may have vividly reawakened in the  remembrance of many the mighty mission which our age is called on to  perform for the development of our race, even in the realm of  harmony,--more especially in our Father-land.

LIFE'S JOYS AND SORROWS.  1783 TO 1815.          BEETHOVEN'S LETTERS.      PART I.      1.    TO THE ELECTOR OF COLOGNE, FREDERICK MAXIMILIAN.[1]    ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE,--    Music from my fourth year has ever been my favorite pursuit. Thus early  introduced to the sweet Muse, who attuned my soul to pure harmony, I loved  her, and sometimes ventured to think that I was beloved by her in return. I  have now attained my eleventh year, and my Muse often whispered to me in  hours of inspiration,--Try to write down the harmonies in your soul. Only  eleven years old! thought I; does the character of an author befit me? and  what would more mature artists say? I felt some trepidation; but my Muse  willed it--so I obeyed, and wrote.    May I now, therefore, Illustrious Prince, presume to lay the first-fruits  of my juvenile labors at the foot of your throne? and may I hope that you  will condescend to cast an encouraging and kindly glance on them? You will;  for Art and Science have ever found in you a judicious protector and a  generous patron, and rising talent has always prospered under your  fostering and fatherly care. Encouraged by this cheering conviction, I  venture to approach you with these my youthful efforts. Accept them as the  pure offering of childlike reverence, and graciously vouchsafe to regard  with indulgence them and their youthful composer,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The dedication affixed to this work, \"Three Sonatas for the  Piano, dedicated to my illustrious master, Maximilian Friedrich, Archbishop  and Elector of Cologne, by Ludwig van"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#2)"],[1,"malefactors, who drank greedily of it, which I thought did not suit      well with their deplorable circumstances. After this the three      thoughtless young men, who at first seemed not enough concerned,      grew most shamefully wanton and daring, behaving, themselves in a      manner that would have been ridiculous in men in any circumstances      whatever. They swore, laughed, and talked obscenely, and wished      their wicked companions good luck with as much assurance as if their      employment had been the most lawful.        At the place of execution the scene grew still more shocking, and      the clergyman who attended was more the subject of ridicule than of      their serious attention. The Psalm was sung amidst the curses and      quarrelling of hundreds of the most abandoned and profligate of      mankind, upon them (so stupid are they to any sense of decency) all      the preparation of the unhappy wretches seems to serve only for      subject of a barbarous kind of mirth, altogether inconsistent with      humanity. And as soon as the poor creatures were half dead, I was      much surprised to see the populace fall to hauling and pulling the      carcasses with so much earnestness as to occasion several warm      rencounters and broken heads. These, I was told, were the friends of      the persons executed, or such as, for the sake of to-night, chose to      appear so: as well as some persons sent by private surgeons to      obtain bodies for dissection. The contests between these were fierce      and bloody, and frightful to look at; so I made the best of my way      out of the crowd, and with some difficulty rode back among the large      number of people who had been upon the same errand as myself. The      face of every one spoke a kind of mirth, as if the spectacle they      had beheld had afforded pleasure instead of pain, which I am wholly      unable to account for....        One of the bodies was carried to the lodging of his wife, who not      being in the way to receive it, they immediately hawked it about to      every surgeon they could think of; and when none would buy it they      rubbed tar all over it, and left it in a field scarcely covered with      earth.    In a few words, too, Swift draws a vivid picture of a rogue on his last  journey through the London streets:        His waistcoat, and stockings, and breeches were white;      His cap had a new cherry ribbon to tie't.      The maids to the doors and the balconies ran,      And said, \"Lack-a-day, he's a proper young man!\"      But as from the windows the ladies he spied,      Like a beau in a box, he bow'd low on each side.        Execution day, or Tyburn Fair, as it was jocularly called, was not      only a holiday for the ragamuffins and idlers of London; folk of all      classes made their way thither to indulge a morbid desire of seeing      the dying agonies of a fellow being, criminal or not. There were      grand stands and scaffoldings from which the more favoured could      view the proceedings in comfort, and every inch of window space and      room on the neighbouring roofs was worth a pretty penny to the      owners. In his last scene of the career of the Idle Apprentice      Hogarth drew a picture of Tyburn Tree which no description can      amplify.        As the procession drew near the hangman clambered to the cross-piece      of the gallows and lolled there, pipe in mouth, until the first cart      drew up beneath him. Then he would reach down, or one of his      assistants would pass up, one after the other, the loose ends of the      halters which the condemned men had had placed round their necks      before leaving Newgate. When all were made fast Jack Ketch climbed      down and kicked his heels until the sheriff, or maybe the felons      themselves, gave him the sign to drive away the cart and leave its      occupants dangling in mid-air. The dead men's clothes were his      perquisite, and now was his time to claim them. There is a graphic      description of how, on one occasion, when the murderer \"flung down      his handkerchief for the signal for the cart to move on, Jack Ketch,      instead of instantly whipping on the horse, jumped on the other side      of him to snatch up the handkerchief, lest he should lose his      rights. He then returned to the head of the cart and jehu'd him out      of the world\".        As the cart drew away a few carrier pigeons, which were released      from the galleries, flew off City-ward to bear the tidings to      Newgate.    Perhaps as good a description of the actual event as can be obtained is  contained in a letter from Anthony Storer to his friend George Selwyn, a  morbid cynic whose cruel and tasteless bon-mots were hailed as wit by  Horace Walpole and his cronies. The execution was that of Dr. Dodd, the  \"macaroni parson\", whose unfortunate vanity led him to forgery and  Tyburn. The date--June 27, 1777--is considerably after the period of our  book, but the description applies as well as if it had been written  expressly for it.        Upon the whole, the piece was not very full of events. The doctor,      to all appearances, was rendered perfectly stupid from despair. His      hat was flapped all round, and pulled over his eyes, which were      never directed to any object around, nor even raised, except now and      then lifted up in the course of his prayers. He came in a coach, and      a very heavy shower of rain fell just upon his entering the      executioner's cart, and another just at his putting on his nightcap.      During the shower an umbrella was held over his head, which Gilly      Williams, who was present, observed was quite unnecessary, as the      doctor was going to a place where he might be dried.        He was a considerable time in praying, which some people standing      about seemed rather tired with; they rather wished for a more      interesting part of the tragedy. The wind, which was high, blew off      his hat, which rather embarrassed him, and discovered to us his      countenance, which we could scarcely see before. His hat, however,      was soon restored to him, and he went on with his prayers. There      were two clergymen attending on him, one of whom seemed very much      affected. The other, I suppose, was the Ordinary of Newgate, as he      was perfectly indifferent and unfeeling in everything he did and      said.        The executioner took both the hat and wig off at the same time. Why      he put on his wig again I do not know, but he did; and the doctor      took off his wig a second time, and then tied on the nightcap which      did not fit him; but whether he stretched that or took another, I      did not perceive. He then put on his nightcap himself, and upon his      taking it he certainly had a smile on his countenance, and very soon      afterwards there was an end of all his hopes and fears on this side      of the grave. He never moved from the place he first took in the      cart; seemed absorbed in despair and utterly dejected; without any      other sign of animation but in praying. I stayed until he was cut      down and put in the hearse.    But the hangman's work was not always done when he had turned off his  man. The full sentence for high treason, for example, provided him with  much more occupation. In the first place, the criminal was drawn to the  gallows and not carried or allowed to walk. Common humanity had  mitigated this sentence to being drawn upon a hurdle or sledge, which  preserved him from the horrors of being dragged over the stones. Having  been hanged, the traitor was then cut down alive, and Jack Ketch set  about disembowelling him and burning his entrails before he died. The  head was then completely severed, the body quartered and the dismembered  pieces taken away for exhibition at Temple Bar and other prominent  places.    Here is the account of one such execution. \"After the traitor had hung  six minutes he was cut down, and having life in him, as he lay upon the  block to be quartered, the executioner gave him several blows on his  breast, which not having the effect designed, he immediately cut his  throat; after which he took his head off; then ripped him open and took  out his bowels and heart, and then threw them into a fire which consumed  them. Then he slashed his four quarters and put them with the head into  a coffin.... His head was put on Temple Bar and his body and limbs  suffered to be buried.\"    Such proceedings were exceptional, however. In the majority of  executions the body was taken down when life was considered to be  extinct, and carried away to Surgeon's Hall for dissection. Sometimes  the relatives used their influence to have the corpse handed over to  them (often not even in a coffin) and they then carried it away in a  coach for decent burial, or to try resuscitation. Occasionally, indeed,  hanged men came to life again. In 1740 one Duel, or Dewell, was hanged  for a rape, and his body taken to Surgeons' Hall in the ordinary  routine. As one of the attendants was washing it he perceived signs of  life. Steps were taken immediately and Duel was brought to, and  eventually taken away in triumph by the mob, who had got wind of the  affair and refused to allow the Law to re-hang their man. A little  earlier something of the same sort had happened to John Smith, who had  been hanging for five minutes and a quarter, during which time the  hangman \"pulled him by the legs and used other means to put a speedy  period to his life\", when a reprieve arrived and he was cut down. He was  hurried away to a neighbouring tavern where restoratives were given,  blood was let, and after a time he came to himself, \"to the great  admiration of the spectators\". According to his own account of the  affair, he felt a terrible pain when first the cart drew away and left  him dangling, but that ceased almost at once, his last sensation being  that of a light"]]]
