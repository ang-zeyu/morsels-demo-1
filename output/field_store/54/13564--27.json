Naught will avail her beauty,  If she have not wit beside.

IX      Nay, but always and forever  Like the bending yellow grain,  Or quick water in a channel,  Is the heart of man.    Comes the unseen breath in power                                          5  Like a great wind from the sea,  And we bow before his coming,  Though we know not why.

Whoso is crowned with flowers                                             5  Has favour with the gods,  Who have no kindly eyes  For the ungarlanded.          XI      When the Cretan maidens  Dancing up the full moon  Round some fair new altar,  Trample the soft blossoms of fine grass,    There is mirth among them.                                                5  Aphrodite's children  Ask her benediction  On their bridals in the summer night.

She wrenched herself free, and leaped away from him. Her face was  bright now, and the promise of smiles was made good.    \"Behave yourself, sir.\" She tossed her head with a familiar backward  motion to throw the chestnut hair from her face, and looked at him  with eyes veiled slightly under their lashes. \"You will go with Kate  and me?\"    Before he could answer, a cry from some one on the plain below  attracted their attention. They turned and saw another wagon-train  pulling into the settlement. The children were shooting and running  alongside the weary oxen; men and women went forward expectantly.    \"That must be the train uncle expected. Let us go down,\" said Nell.    Joe did not answer; but followed her down the path. When they gained  a clump of willows near the cabins he bent forward and took her  hand. She saw the reckless gleam in his eyes.    \"Don't. They'll see,\" she whispered.    \"If that's the only reason you have, I reckon I don't care,\" said  Joe.    \"What do you mean? I didn't say--I didn't tell--oh! let me go!\"  implored Nell.    She tried to release the hand Joe had grasped in his broad palm, but  in vain; the more she struggled the firmer was his hold. A frown  wrinkled her brow and her eyes sparkled with spirit. She saw the  fur-trader's wife looking out of the window, and remembered laughing  and telling the good woman she did not like this young man; it was,  perhaps, because she feared those sharp eyes that she resented his  audacity. She opened her mouth to rebuke him; but no words came. Joe  had bent his head and softly closed her lips with his own.    For the single instant during which Nell stood transfixed, as if  with surprise, and looking up at Joe, she was dumb. Usually the girl  was ready with sharp or saucy words and impulsive in her movements;  but now the bewilderment of being kissed, particularly within view  of the trader's wife, confused her. Then she heard voices, and as  Joe turned away with a smile on his face, the unusual warmth in her  heart was followed by an angry throbbing.    Joe's tall figure stood out distinctly as he leisurely strolled  toward the incoming wagon-train without looking backward. Flashing  after him a glance that boded wordy trouble in the future, she ran  into the cabin.    As she entered the door it seemed certain the grizzled frontiersman  sitting on the bench outside had grinned knowingly at her, and  winked as if to say he would keep her secret. Mrs. Wentz, the  fur-trader's wife, was seated by the open window which faced the  fort; she was a large woman, strong of feature, and with that calm  placidity of expression common to people who have lived long in  sparsely populated districts. Nell glanced furtively at her and  thought she detected the shadow of a smile in the gray eyes.    \"I saw you and your sweetheart makin' love behind the willow,\" Mrs.  Wentz said in a matter-of-fact voice. \"I don't see why you need hide  to do it. We folks out here like to see the young people sparkin'.  Your young man is a fine-appearin' chap. I felt certain you was  sweethearts, for all you allowed you'd known him only a few days.  Lize Davis said she saw he was sweet on you. I like his face. Jake,  my man, says as how he'll make a good husband for you, and he'll  take to the frontier like a duck does to water. I'm sorry you'll not  tarry here awhile. We don't see many lasses, especially any as  pretty as you, and you'll find it more quiet and lonesome the  farther West you get. Jake knows all about Fort Henry, and Jeff  Lynn, the hunter outside, he knows Eb and Jack Zane, and Wetzel, and  all those Fort Henry men. You'll be gettin' married out there, won't  you?\"    \"You are--quite wrong,\" said Nell, who all the while Mrs. Wentz was  speaking grew rosier and rosier. \"We're not anything---\"    Then Nell hesitated and finally ceased speaking. She saw that  denials or explanations were futile; the simple woman had seen the  kiss, and formed her own conclusions. During the few days Nell had  spent at Fort Pitt, she had come to understand that the dwellers on  the frontier took everything as a matter of course. She had seen  them manifest a certain pleasure; but neither surprise, concern, nor  any of the quick impulses so common among other people. And this was  another lesson Nell took to heart. She realized that she was  entering upon a life absolutely different from her former one, and  the thought caused her to shrink from the ordeal. Yet all the  suggestions regarding her future home; the stories told about  Indians, renegades, and of the wild border-life, fascinated her.  These people who had settled in this wild region were simple, honest  and brave; they accepted what came as facts not to be questioned,  and believed what looked true. Evidently the fur-trader's wife and  her female neighbors had settled in their minds the relation in  which the girl stood to Joe.    This latter reflection heightened Nell's resentment toward her  lover. She stood with her face turned away from Mrs. Wentz; the  little frown deepened, and she nervously tapped her foot on the  floor.    \"Where is my sister?\" she presently asked.    \"She went to see the wagon-train come in. Everybody's out there.\"    Nell deliberated a moment and then went into the open air. She saw a  number of canvas-covered wagons drawn up in front of the cabins; the  vehicles were dusty and the wheels encrusted with yellow mud. The  grizzled frontiersman who had smiled at Nell stood leaning on his  gun, talking to three men, whose travel-stained and worn homespun  clothes suggested a long and toilsome journey. There was the bustle  of excitement incident to the arrival of strangers; to the quick  exchange of greetings, the unloading of wagons and unharnessing of  horses and oxen.    Nell looked here and there for her sister. Finally she saw her  standing near her uncle while he conversed with one of the  teamsters. The girl did not approach them; but glanced quickly  around in search of some one else. At length she saw Joe unloading  goods from one of the wagons; his back was turned toward her, but  she at once recognized the challenge conveyed by the broad  shoulders. She saw no other person; gave heed to nothing save what  was to her, righteous indignation.    Hearing her footsteps, the young man turned, glancing at her  admiringly, said:    \"Good evening, Miss.\"    Nell had not expected such a matter-of-fact greeting from Joe. There  was not the slightest trace of repentance in his calm face, and he  placidly continued his labor.    \"Aren't you sorry you--you treated me so?\" burst out Nell.    His coolness was exasperating. Instead of the contrition and apology  she had expected, and which was her due, he evidently intended to  tease her, as he had done so often.    The young man dropped a blanket and stared.    \"I don't understand,\" he said, gravely. \"I never saw you before.\"    This was too much for quick-tempered Nell. She had had some vague  idea of forgiving him, after he had sued sufficiently for pardon;  but now, forgetting her good intentions in the belief that he was  making sport of her when he should have pleaded for forgiveness, she  swiftly raised her hand and slapped him smartly.    The red blood flamed to the young man's face; as he staggered  backward with his hand to his cheek, she heard a smothered  exclamation behind her, and then the quick, joyous barking of a dog.    When Nell turned she was amazed to see Joe standing beside the  wagon, while a big white dog was leaping upon him. Suddenly she felt  faint. Bewildered, she looked from Joe to the man she had just  struck; but could not say which was the man who professed to love  her.    \"Jim! So you followed me!\" cried Joe, starting forward and flinging  his arms around the other.    \"Yes, Joe, and right glad I am to find you,\" answered the young man,  while a peculiar expression of pleasure came over his face.    \"It's good to see you again! And here's my old dog Mose! But how on  earth did you know? Where did you strike my trail? What are you  going to do out here on the frontier? Tell me all. What happened  after I left---\"    Then Joe saw Nell standing nearby, pale and distressed, and he felt  something was amiss. He glanced quickly from her to his brother; she  seemed to be dazed, and Jim looked grave.    \"What the deuce--? Nell, this is my brother Jim, the one I told you  about. Jim, this is my friend, Miss Wells.\"    \"I am happy to meet Miss Wells,\" said Jim, with a smile, \"even  though she did slap my face for nothing.\"    \"Slapped you? What for?\" Then the truth dawned on Joe, and he  laughed until the tears came into his eyes. \"She took you for me!  Ha, ha, ha! Oh, this is great!\"    Nell's face was now rosy red and moisture glistened in her eyes; but  she tried bravely to stand her ground. Humiliation had taken the  place of anger.    \"I--I--am sorry, Mr. Downs. I did take you for him. He--he has  insulted me.\" Then she turned and ran into the cabin.        Chapter II.    Joe and Jim were singularly alike. They were nearly the same size,  very tall, but so heavily built as to appear of medium height, while  their grey eyes and, indeed, every feature of their clean-cut faces  corresponded so exactly as to proclaim them brothers.    \"Already up to your old tricks?\" asked Jim, with his hand on Joe's  shoulder, as they both watched Nell's flight.    \"I'm really fond of her, Jim, and didn't mean to hurt her feelings.  But tell me about yourself; what made you come West?\"    \"To teach the Indians, and I was, no doubt, strongly influenced by  your being here.\"    \"You're going to do as you ever have--make some sacrifice. You are  always devoting yourself; if not to me, to some other. Now it's your  life you're"]]]
