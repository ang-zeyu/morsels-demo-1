[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#2)"],[1,"to-day? It is literature rather than law.  He no longer goes to the voluminous Talmud to find specific injunction  for specific need. Search in that vast sea would be tedious and  unfruitful. Its legal portion has long been codified in separate  digests. Maimonides was the first to classify Talmudic law. Still later  one Ascheri prepared a digest called the \"Four Rows,\" in which the  decisions of later Rabbis were incorporated. But it was the famous  Shulchan Aruch (a prepared table) written by Joseph Caro in the  sixteenth century, that formed the most complete code of Talmudic law  enlarged to date, and accepted as religious authority by the orthodox  Jews to-day.    I have already referred to the literature that has grown out of the  Talmud. The \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" treats every law recognized by nations  from the Talmudic stand-point. This will give the world a complete  Talmudic point of view. In speaking of it as literature, it lacks  perhaps that beauty of form in its language which the stricter demand as  literature _sine qua non_, and yet its language is unique. It is  something more than terse, for many a word is a whole sentence. Written  in Aramaic, it contains many words in the languages of the nations with  whom Israel came in contact--Greek, Roman, Persian, and words from other  tongues.    Like the Jew, the Talmud has had a history, almost as checkered as that  of its creator. Like him it was singled out for persecution. Louis IX.  burned twenty-four cart-loads of Talmuds in Paris. Its right of survival  had often been wrested through church synods and councils. It has been  banned, it has been excommunicated, it has been made the subject of  popish bulls; but it was in the sixteenth century that the Benedictine  Monks made a particular determined effort to destroy it. Fortunately  they knew not the times. It was the age of Humanism, the forerunner of  the Reformation, and the Talmud found its ablest defender in the great  Christian humanist, John Reuchlin. He was the one first to tell his  co-religionists, \"Do not condemn the Talmud before you understand it.  Burning is no argument. Instead of burning all Jewish literature, it  were better to found chairs in the universities for its exposition.\" The  cause of liberality and light gained the day, and the printing-press  decided the perpetuation of the Talmud.    In the second stage of its persecution the censor figures. His  Philistine pen passed ruthlessly over everything that seemed to hint at  criticism of the Church; but not content with expunging the heretical  and the inferentially heretical, the censor at times went even so far as  to erase sentiments particularly lofty, in order that the Talmud should  not have the credit of expounding noble doctrine, nor the Jew the  advantage of studying it.    But the latest stage of its persecution belongs to more modern days,  when inquisitions were out of date and monkish claws were cut. The  traducer would spitefully engage the services of some renegade Jew, to  gather from the Talmud all portions and passages that might seem  grotesque and ridiculous, so that the world might form an unfavorable  impression of the Talmud and of the people who treasure it. This has  been done with so much success that up till very recently the Gentile  world, including the Christian clergy, knew of the Talmud only through  these unfortunate perversions and caricatures. Imagine the citation of a  chapter from _Leviticus_ and one from _Chronicles_, of some vindictive  passages in the _Psalms_, of a few skeptical bits in _Ecclesiastes_ and  _Job_, and one or two of the barbaric stories in _Judges_, to be offered  to the world as a fair picture of the Bible, and you will understand the  sort of treatment the Talmud has received from the world at large and  the kind of estimate it has been given opportunity to form.    What is the value of the Talmud for the Jew? Certainly its greatest  value was rendered in the Middle Ages, when literature was scant and  copies of the few books in existence were rarer. When the Jew was shut  out of the world's pleasure and the world's culture and barred up in  Ghetto slums, then it was that the Talmud became his recreation and his  consolation, feeding his mind and his faith. In this way it not only  became in the Middle Ages a picture of the Jew, but largely formed his  character. It made him a keen dialectician, tempered with a thoughtful  and poetic touch. It fostered his patience and his humor and kept vivid  his ideals. It linked him with the Orient, while living in the Occident  and made him a bridge between the old and the new.    To the world at large it has great value archaeologically. Here are  preserved ancient laws, glint lights on past history, forgotten forms in  the classic tongues, and pictures of old civilization. No one criticism  can cover the whole work. It is so many-sided. It includes so many  different standards of worth and value. If we take it as a whole, it is  good, it is bad and indifferent; it is trash and it is treasure; it is  dust and it is diamonds; it is potsherd and it is pearls; and in the  hands of impartial scholars, it is one of the great monuments of mental  achievement, one of the world's wonders.    Maurice H. Harris          THE TALMUD           *       *       *       *       *    Where do we learn that the Shechinah rests even upon one who studies the  law? In Exodus xx. 24, where it is written, \"In all places where I  record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 6, col. 1.    One pang of remorse at a man's heart is of more avail than many stripes  applied to him. (See Prov. xvii. 10.)    Ibid., fol. 7, col. 1.    \"Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord!\" (Deut. vi. 4.) Whosoever  prolongs the utterance of the word one, shall have his days and years  prolonged to him. So also _Zohar_, syn. tit. ii.    Ibid., fol. 13, col. 2.    Once, as the Rabbis tell us, the Roman Government issued a decree  forbidding Israel to study the law. Whereupon Pappus, the son of  Yehudah, one day found Rabbi Akiva teaching it openly to multitudes,  whom he had gathered round him to hear it. \"Akiva,\" said he, \"art thou  not afraid of the Government?\" \"List,\" was the reply, \"and I will tell  thee how it is by a parable. It is with me as with the fishes whom a  fox, walking once by a river's side, saw darting distractedly to and fro  in the stream; and, addressing, inquired, 'From what, pray, are ye  fleeing?' 'From the nets,' they replied, 'which the children of men have  set to ensnare us.' 'Why, then,' rejoined the fox, 'not try the dry land  with me, where you and I can live together, as our fathers managed to do  before us?' 'Surely,' exclaimed they, 'thou art not he of whom we have  heard so much as the most cunning of animals, for herein thou art not  wise, but foolish. For if we have cause to fear where it is natural for  us to live, how much more reason have we to do so where we needs must  die!' Just so,\" continued Akiva, \"is it with us who study the law, in  which (Deut. xxx. 20) it is written, 'He is thy life and the length of  thy days;' for if we suffer while we study the law, how much more shall  we if we neglect it?\" Not many days after, it is related, this Rabbi  Akiva was apprehended and thrown into prison. As it happened, they led  him out for execution just at the time when \"Hear, O Israel!\" fell to be  repeated, and as they tore his flesh with currycombs, and as he was with  long-drawn breath sounding forth the word one, his soul departed from  him. Then came forth a voice from heaven which said, \"Blessed art thou,  Rabbi Akiva, for thy soul and the word one left thy body together.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 61, col. 2.    The badger, as it existed in the days of Moses, was an animal of unique  type, and the learned are not agreed whether it was a wild one or a  domestic. It had only one horn on its forehead; and was assigned for the  time to Moses, who made a covering of its skin for the tabernacle; after  which it became extinct, having served the purpose of its existence.  Rabbi Yehudah says, \"The ox, also, which the first man, Adam,  sacrificed, had but one horn on its forehead.\"    _Shabbath_, fol. 28, col. 2.    Once a Gentile came to Shamai, and said, \"Proselytize me, but on  condition that thou teach me the whole law, even the whole of it, while  I stand upon one leg.\" Shamai drove him off with the builder's rod which  he held in his hand. When he came to Hillel with the same challenge,  Hillel converted him by answering him on the spot, \"That which is  hateful to thyself, do not do to thy neighbor. This is the whole law,  and the rest is its commentary.\" (Tobit, iv. 15; Matt. vii. 12.)    Ibid., fol. 31, col. 1.    When Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai and his son, Rabbi Elazar, came out of  their cave on a Friday afternoon, they saw an old man hurrying along  with two bunches of myrtle in his hand. \"What.\" said they, accosting  him, \"dost thou want with these?\" \"To smell them in honor of the  Sabbath,\" was the reply. \"Would not one bunch,\" they remarked, \"be  enough for that purpose?\" \"Nay,\" the old man replied; \"one is in honor  of 'Remember' (Exod. xxii. 28); and one in honor of 'Keep' (Deut. v.  8).\" Thereupon Rabbi Shimon remarked to his son, \"Behold how the  commandments are regarded by Israel!\"    Ibid., fol. 33, col. 2.    Not one single thing has God created in vain. He created the snail as a  remedy for a blister; the fly for the sting of a wasp; the gnat for the  bite of a serpent; the serpent itself for healing the itch (or the  scab); and the lizard (or the spider) for the sting of a scorpion.    Ibid., fol. 77. col. 2.    When a man is dangerously ill, the law grants dispensation, for it says,  \"You may break one Sabbath on his behalf, that he may be preserved to  keep many Sabbaths.\"    _Shabbath_, fol. 151, col. 2.

Sono Zanetto; un nomade suonator; mi diletto ogni dì nel cambiar     d'aria, e di tetto.       Venti mestieri inutili       Mi fan campar la vita     So condurre col fragile       Remo la barca rapida.     Slancio nell'aria il falco       Volo in corsa ardita         Domo col morso         L'agile puledro.         E in un sonetto       Chiudo le rime fulgide       In cerchio d'oro stretto.          I am Zanetto, a wandering musician;        It's my delight to change house and air every day!              Twenty useless callings              I have, to make my living.          I know how to push the bending oar            My bark speed giving;          I can bring down the falcon            Flying in the heavens;          Can tame the kicking mule,            And good verse arrange in sevens--              So I am not a fool!    SILVIA.       E non saranno rare       Le volte, in cui     Ti manca il desinare!          But does it often happen        That your dinner you are lacking?    ZANETTO.         Talvolta, sì.     Ma se trovo in paese     Qualche signor cortese     Io sono il benvenuto     M'accettano alla mensa     Il mio liuto     Rallegra la brigata     E per quel dì la cena     È assicurata!              Sometimes, yes!          But I find where'er going          True courtesy is showing,          And I know I am welcome--          By my lute I am able          To find a place at a table,          Company entertaining,          And for that day          A supper I am gaining.    SILVIA.       Firenze è la tua mèta?          Are you going to Florence?    ZANETTO.               Non so.     Se mai più florido qualche sentier mi piaccia     Lo seguirò. La strana fantasia segue l'ardita traccia     Segnata dall'augel nell'aria azzurra     Ancor sul mio cammino non trovai fortuna!                  Don't know.        If I find a more flowery path        I follow it. It is a strange fancy that draws        the bird through the trackless azure sky.        And I must say, too, that in my journeys        I have not found fortune.    SILVIA.       Ma non sognasti un giorno di riposo nel correr tuo fantastico e     dubbioso? E non hai mai veduta una casetta bianca tra i verdi pampini,     donde una giovinetta un rapido buon giorno ti mando?          But have you not dreamed of resting some day in your fantastic and        doubtful wandering? And have you not seen a little white house, set        'mid green, waving palms, and where a young girl once gave you a        quick \"Good morning!\"    ZANETTO.       Sì, qualche volta. Ma qual io mi sono, penso ai padri ai tutori, e non     mi piace delle famiglie disturbar la pace.          Yes, sometimes--But I know what I am--I think of fathers, and        tutors; and it does not please me to disturb the family peace.    SILVIA.       Nè ti fermasti mai se la fanciulla     Il fiore ti getto che       Avea in petto?          Have you not set your mind firmly on the girl who gave you that        flower you wear on your breast?    ZANETTO.       Un bacio e seguitavo la mia strada     La libertà m'è cara.     Non voglio altro fardello     Che il liuto, e la piuma del capello.       Un amore       Dentro al core     È un bagaglio troppo grave!          A kiss! and I go on my travels. Liberty to me is dear. I want no        other burdens than my lute and the feather in my cap!            And love        When you would move        Is too heavy to carry!    SILVIA.       L'augel di bosco non vuol gabbia!     Chi sa un giorno non t'alletti il nido!          A bird in the woods wants no cage          But who will say          That some day        He will not build a nest?    ZANETTO.       No, No! L'amor mi fa paura, sai?     È così bello andarsene via,--     Come le libellule che van per     L'aria libere!          No! No! Do you know, all love makes me afraid? It is delightful to        go your own way, as you please, and be as free as the air!    SILVIA.       Ma, non sarai felice.       E vieni qui dal fato       Tenuto per la mano       O il vol di qualche rondino       Seguisti da lontano?          But you are not happy--          And fate did you follow          As led by its hand;          Or the flight of a swallow          From some far-away land?    ZANETTO.       Quasi!          Perhaps--    SILVIA.       Ti guida dunque una speranza?          Are you led by some hope?    ZANETTO.       Appeno un sogno.          'Twas only a dream.    SILVIA.       Parla!          Tell it!    ZANETTO.       Io qui potrei forse restare. Senti: I pari miei, padre e madre non     hanno. Son figlio d'un marchese o d'un villano? E chi lo sa? Pel mondo     corsi fin'ora libero giocondo, nè mai vita migliore ho sospirato. Ma     da quando ho gustato la cara voce tua, Madonna bella ho sognato:          Perhaps I may stay here! Know, then, that I have no parents, father        or mother. I may be the son of a Marquis, or of a villain--who        knows? In the world's course so far I've lived a free and merry        life; and have never desired any other. But after having enjoyed        your dear voice, beautiful Madonna, I've been dreaming that I might        have--a sister!         D'Avere una sorella.       Quando m'hai susurrato       Dell'intima dolcezza     Del mondo, in mezzo di fiore     Allora sì, mi non sentito solo!          Since you have aroused in me the desire for a sweet little cottage,        far from all the noises of the world, set in the midst of flowers,        now, yes! I begin to feel lonesome!        I accept your wise counsel!       Io cedo ai tuoi consigli. Oh! se volessi trattenerti vicin,     quest'usignolo randagio! Io resterci teco sempre d'accanto mi avresti     e col mio canto le tue lunghe giornate abbrevierei!          Oh! If you were willing to be entertained by this nightingale        wanderer, I would stay here with you. I would be always near you;        and with my lute and song the long hours of your mornings I would        shorten!    SILVIA (to herself).       Bambino!     Come il core mi sussulta     Che è mai questo timore?       Aver lo sempre meco,       Udirlo delirante       Darmi il nome d'amante!       Oh, il mio sogno avverato!          My darling! How my heart is exulting!          What is it always makes me fear?        To have all I have willed!          To hear I'm aflame!          Tell me my love's name!        My dream has been fulfilled!    ZANETTO.       Vuoi?          Are you willing?    SILVIA (to herself).       Se voglio? Ah, no, mai!     Pur è lui che mi supplica!          I willing? Ah! no! never!        Why does he ask me?    ZANETTO.       Madonna, domandi troppo lo so; ma vuoi?          Madonna!        I ask too much, I know; but will you?    SILVIA.       Saprà chi son domani!          You shall know who I am tomorrow.    ZANETTO.       Anco una volta vuoi!          Again I ask you, will you?    SILVIA.       Non posso!          I can not.    ZANETTO.       E perchè?          And why not?    SILVIA.       Son vedova; son povera; e non posso ospitar poeti erranti.          A widow am I, and poor, and cannot entertain wandering poets.    ZANETTO.       Uno scudier non hai?          Don't you have a servant?    SILVIA.       No!          No!    ZANETTO.       Un paggio?          A footman?    SILVIA.       No!          No.    ZANETTO.       Io con un frutto desino!          I can dine on fruit!    SILVIA.            Deh, taci!     Sono vedova vivo nel pianto sola.               Don't speak of it.        I'm a widow, and live alone, weeping!    ZANETTO.       Ed io non vo' che starmene ai tuoi piedi!          And may I not stand at your feet?    SILVIA.       È impossible, credi!          'Tis impossible. Believe me!    ZANETTO.       Dunque per sempre addio, bel sogno mio!     Avrò forse domani, più fortuna con Silvia.          Then good-bye forever my beautiful dream!        I may have, perhaps tomorrow, better fortune with Silvia!    SILVIA (to herself).       Che dice?          What says he?    ZANETTO.       Poi che vani furono i preghi miei, io chiederti       vorrei di Silvia fiorentina     La dicono regina d'ogni bellezza       dicono che il sguardo       È una carezza       Che conquista e innamora       Dicon che è bella e pallida       Al par di te signora       E poi ch'è ricca e prodiga       Andavo a cercar lei.          Then in vain were all my prayers. I would ask thee about Silvia,        the Florentine. She, they say, is the queen of all beauty. They say        that her look is a caress which conquers and overwhelms in love.        They say that she is fair and beautiful as thou art, lady; and        then, that she is rich and liberal. I'll go and seek her.    SILVIA (to herself).       Mio Dio!          Great Heaven!    ZANETTO.       Forse potrei entrar fra i suoi scudieri. Ma intesi mormorare, che la     strana bellezza di quell'altiera donna e il pazzo viver suo recan     sventura. Ti confesso, Madonna che ho paura! Che debbo far,     consigliami. Debbo andare da Silvia?          Perhaps I may enter her list of knights. But I intend to warble        about the beauty of another lady! and the mad fool who would bring        her misfortune. I confess to thee, Madonna, that I'm afraid! What        shall I do? Give me your advice. Shall I go to Silvia?    SILVIA (to herself).       Sarebbe ritornato!     Questo fanciullo ignoto che mi     Colmò di tenerezza l'anima, la     Sorte a me l'invia. È la felicità,     Debbo cacciarlo via?          Well, I advise you not to! This unknown boy stirs up the inmost        tenderness of my heart. The opportunity invites; and the happiness;        would there were a way to catch him!    ZANETTO.
