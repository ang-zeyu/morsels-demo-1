When mother, son, and sister were spoken of, they were called a Trinity,  and to this Marguerite herself bore witness when she said, with charming  modesty,--                   \"Such boon is mine, to feel the amity                 That God hath putten in our trinity,                 Wherein to make a third, I, all unfitted                 To be that number's shadow, am admitted.\"    Marguerite it was for whom this close communion of three persons had the  most dolorous consequences: we shall fall in with her more than once in  the course of this history; but, whether or no, she was assuredly the  best of this princely trio, and Francis I.  was the most spoiled by it.  There is nothing more demoralizing than to be an idol.    The first acts of his government were sensible and of good omen.  He  confirmed or renewed the treaties or truces which Louis XII., at the  close of his reign, had concluded with the Venetians, the Swiss, the  pope, the King of England, the Archduke Charles, and the Emperor  Maximilian, in order to restore peace to his kingdom.  At home Francis I.  maintained at his council the principal and most tried servants of his  predecessor, amongst others the finance-minister, Florimond Robertet; and  he raised to four the number of the marshals of France, in order to  confer that dignity on Bayard's valiant friend, James of Chabannes, Lord  of La Palice, who even under Louis XII. had been entitled by the  Spaniards \"the great marshal of France.\"  At the same time he exalted to  the highest offices in the state two new men, Charles, Duke of Bourbon,  who was still a mere youth, but already a warrior of renown, and Anthony  Duprat, the able premier president of the Parliament of Paris; the former  he made constable, and the latter chancellor of France.  His mother,  Louise of Savoy, was not unconcerned, it is said, in both promotions;  she was supposed to feel for the young constable something more than  friendship, and she regarded the veteran magistrate, not without reason,  as the man most calculated to unreservedly subserve the interests of the  kingly power and her own.    These measures, together with the language and the behavior of Francis  I., and the care he took to conciliate all who approached him, made a  favorable impression on France and on Europe.  In Italy, especially,  princes as well as people, and Pope Leo X. before all, flattered  themselves, or were pleased to appear as if they flattered themselves,  that war would not come near them again, and that the young king had his  heart set only on making Burgundy secure against sudden and outrageous  attacks from the Swiss.  The aged King of Spain, Ferdinand the Catholic,  adopting the views of his able minister, Cardinal Ximenes, alone showed  distrust and anxiety.  \"Go not to sleep,\" said he to his former allies;  \"a single instant is enough to bring the French in the wake of their  master whithersoever he pleases to lead them; is it merely to defend  Burgundy that the King of France is adding fifteen hundred lances to his  men-at-arms, and that a huge train of artillery is defiling into  Lyonness, and little by little approaching the mountains?\"    [Illustration: Cardinal Ximenes----14]    Ferdinand urged the pope, the Emperor Maximilian, the Swiss, and  Maximilian Sforza, Duke of Milan, to form a league for the defence of  Italy; but Leo X.  persisted in his desire of remaining or appearing  neutral, as the common father of the faithful.  Meanwhile the French  ambassador at Rome, William Bude, \"a man,\" says Guicciardini, \"of  probably unique erudition amongst the men of our day,\" and, besides, a  man of keen and sagacious intellect, was unfolding the secret working of  Italian diplomacy, and sending to Paris demands for his recall, saying,  \"Withdraw me from this court full of falsehoods; this is a residence too  much out of my element.\"  The answer was, that he should have patience,  and still negotiate; for France, meeting ruse by ruse, was willing to be  considered hoodwinked, whilst the eyes of the pope, diverted by a hollow  negotiation, were prevented from seeing the peril which was gathering  round the Italian league and its declared or secret champions.  [Gaillard, _Histoire de Francois 1er,_ t. i.  p. 208.]    Neither the king nor the pope had for long to take the trouble of  practising mutual deception.  It was announced at Rome that Francis I.,  having arrived at Lyons in July, 1515, had just committed to his mother,  Louise, the regency of the kingdom, and was pushing forward towards the  Alps an army of sixty thousand men and a powerful artillery.  He had won  over to his service Octavian Fregoso, Doge of Genoa; and Barthelemy  d'Alviano, the veteran general of his allies the Venetians, was encamped  with his troops within hail of Verona, ready to support the French in the  struggle he foresaw.  Francis I., on his side, was informed that twenty  thousand Swiss, commanded by the Roman, Prosper Colonna, were guarding  the passes of the Alps in order to shut him out from Milaness.  At the  same time he received the news that the Cardinal of Sion, his most  zealous enemy in connection with the Roman Church, was devotedly  employing, with the secret support of the Emperor Maximilian, his  influence and his preaching for the purpose of raising in Switzerland  a second army of from twenty to five and twenty thousand men, to be  launched against him, if necessary, in Italy.  A Spanish and Roman army,  under the orders of Don Raymond of Cardone, rested motionless at some  distance from the Po, waiting for events and for orders prescribing the  part they were to take.  It was clear that Francis I., though he had been  but six months king, was resolved and impatient to resume in Italy, and  first of all in Milaness, the war of invasion and conquest which had been  engaged in by Charles VIII.  and Louis XII.; and the league of all the  states of Italy save Venice and Genoa, with the pope for their  half-hearted patron, and the Swiss for their fighting men, were  collecting their forces to repel the invader.    It was the month of August; the snow was diminishing and melting away  among the Alps; and the king, with the main body of the army, joined at  Embrun the Constable de Bourbon, who commanded the advance-guard.  But  the two passes of Mount Cenis and Mount Ginevra were strongly guarded by  the Swiss, and others were sought for a little more to the south.  A  shepherd, a chamois-hunter, pointed out one whereby, he said, the  mountains might be crossed, and a descent made upon the plains of the  marquisate of Saluzzo.  The young constable went in person to examine the  spots pointed out by the shepherd; and, the statement having been  verified, it did not seem impossible to get the whole army over, even the  heavy artillery; and they essayed this unknown road.  At several points,  abysses had to be filled up, temporary bridges built, and enormous rocks  pierced; the men-at-arms marched on foot, with great difficulty dragging  their horses; with still greater difficulty the infantry hauled the  cannon over holes incompletely stopped and fragments of yawning rock.  Captains and soldiers set to work together; no labor seems too hard to  eager hope; and in five days the mountain was overcome, and the army  caught sight of the plain where the enemy might be encountered.  A small  body of four hundred men-at-arms, led by Marshal de Chabannes, were the  first to descend into it; and among them was Bayard.  \"Marshal,\" said he  to Chabannes, \"we are told that over the Po yonder is Sir Prosper Colonna,  with two thousand horse, in a town called Villafranca, apprehending  nought and thinking of nought but gaudies.  We must wake up his wits a  little, and this moment get into the saddle with all our troops, that he  be not warned by any.\"  \"Sir Bayard,\" said the marshal, \"it is right well  said; but how shall we cross the River Po, which is so impetuous and  broad?\"  \"Sir,\" said Bayard, \"here is my Lord de Morette's brother, who  knows the ford; he shall cross first, and I after him.\"  So they mounted  their horses, crossed the Po, and \"were soon there, where Sir Prosper  Colonna was at table and was dining, as likewise were all his folk.\"  Bayard, who marched first, found the archers on guard in front of the  Italian leader's quarters.  \"Yield you and utter no sound,\" cried he,  \"else you are dead men.\"  Some set about defending themselves; the rest  ran to warn Colonna, saying, \"Up, sir; for, here are the French in a  great troop already at this door.\"  \"Lads,\" said Colonna to them, \"keep  this door a little till we get some armor on to defend ourselves.\"  But  whilst the fight was going on at the door Bayard had the windows scaled,  and, entering first, cried out, \"Where are you, Sir Prosper?  Yield you;  else you are a dead man.\"  \"Sir Frenchman, who is your captain?\"  asked  Colonna.  \"I am, sir.\"  \"Your name, captain?\"  \"Sir, I am one Bayard of  France, and here are the Lord of La Palice, and the Lords d'Aubigny and  d'Himbercourt, the flower of the captains of France.\"  Colonna  surrendered, cursing Fortune, \"the mother of all sorrow and affliction,  who had taken away his wits, and because he had not been warned of their  coming, for he would at least have made his capture a dear one;\" and he  added, \"It seems a thing divinely done; four noble knights at once, with  their comrades at their backs, to take one Roman noble!\"    Francis I. and the main body of his army had also arrived at the eastern  foot of the Alps, and were advancing into the plains of the country of  Saluzzo and Piedmont.  The Swiss, dumbfounded at so unexpected an  apparition, fell back to Novara,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#2)"],[1,"the graces the king was  pleased to do her and hers, having the superintendence of the household  of the queen whom she insulted without disguise, to the extent of  wounding the king himself.  \"Pray consider that she is your mistress,\" he  said one day to his favorite.  The scandal was great; Bossuet attempted  the task of stopping it.  It was the time of the Jubilee: neither the  king nor Madame de Montespan had lost all religious feeling; the wrath of  God and the refusal of the sacraments had terrors for them still.  Madame  de Montespan left the court after some stormy scenes; the king set out  for Flanders.  \"Pluck this sin from your heart, Sir,\" Bossuet wrote to  him; \"and not only this sin, but the cause of it; go even to the root.  In your triumphant march amongst the people whom you constrain to  recognize your might, would you consider yourself secure of a rebel  fortress if your enemy still had influence there?  We hear of nothing but  the magnificence of your troops, of what they are capable under your  leadership!  And as for me, Sir, I think in my secret heart of a war far  more important, of a far more difficult victory which God holds out  before you.  What would it avail you to be dreaded and victorious  without, when you are vanquished and captive within?\"  \"Pray God for me,\"  wrote the bishop at the same time to Marshal Bellefonds, \"pray Him to  deliver me from the greatest burden man can have to bear, or to quench  all that is man in me, that I may act for Him only.  Thank God, I have  never yet thought, during the whole course of this business, of my  belonging to the world; but that is not all; what is wanted is to be a  St.  Ambrose, a true man of God, a man of that other life, a man in whom  everything should speak, with whom all his words should be oracles of the  Holy Spirit, all his conduct celestial; pray, pray, I do beseech you.\"    At the bottom of his soul, and in the innermost sanctuary of his  conscience, Bossuet felt his weakness; he saw the apostolic severance  from the world, the apostolic zeal and fervor required for the holy  crusade he had undertaken.  \"Your Majesty has given your promise to God  and the world,\" he wrote to Louis XIV. in, ignorance of the secret  correspondence still kept up between the king and Madame de Montespan.  \"I have been to see her,\" added the prelate.  \"I find her pretty calm;  she occupies herself a great deal in good works.  I spoke to her as well  as to you the words in which God commands us to give Him our whole heart;  they caused her to shed many tears; may it please God to fix these truths  in the bottom of both your hearts, and accomplish His work, in order that  so many tears, so much violence, so many strains that you have put upon  yourselves, may not be fruitless.\"    The king was on the road back to Versailles; Madame de Montespan was to  return thither also, her duties required her to do so, it was said;  Bossuet heard of it; he did not for a single instant delude himself as to  the emptiness of the king's promises and of his own hopes.  He  determined, however, to visit the king at Luzarches.  Louis XIV. gave him  no time to speak.    \"Do not say a word to me, sir,\" said he, not without blushing, do not say  a word; I have given my orders, they will have to be executed.\"  Bossuet  held his tongue.  \"He had tried every thrust; had acted like a pontiff of  the earliest times, with a freedom worthy of the earliest ages and the  earliest bishops of the Church,\" says St. Simon.  He saw the inutility of  his efforts; henceforth, prudence and courtly behavior put a seal upon  his lips.  It was the time of the great king's omnipotence and highest  splendor, the time when nobody withstood his wishes.  The great  Mademoiselle had just attempted to show her independence: tired of not  being married, with a curse on the greatness which kept her astrand, she  had made up her mind to a love-match.  \"Guess it in four, guess it in  ten, guess it in a hundred,\" wrote Madame de Sevigne to Madame de  Coulanges: \"you are not near it; well, then, you must be told.  M. de  Lauzun is to marry on Sunday at the Louvre, with the king's permission,  mademoiselle .  .  .  mademoiselle de .  ..  mademoiselle, guess the name  .  .  .  he is to marry Mademoiselle, my word! upon my word! my sacred  word!  Mademoiselle, the great Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle daughter of the  late Monsieur, Mademoiselle grand-daughter of Henry IV., Mademoiselle  d'Eu, Mademoiselle de Dombes, Mademoiselle de Montpensier, Mademoiselle  d' Orleans, Mademoiselle, cousin-german to the king, Mademoiselle  destined to the throne, Mademoiselle, the only match in France who would  have been worthy of Monsieur!\"  The astonishment was somewhat premature;  Mademoiselle did not espouse Lauzun just then, the king broke off the  marriage.  \"I will make you so great,\" he said to Lauzun, \"that you shall  have no cause to regret what I am taking from you; meanwhile, I make you  duke, and peer, and marshal of France.\"  \"Sir,\" broke in Lauzun,  insolently, \"you have made so many dukes that it is no longer an honor to  be one, and as for the baton of marshal of France, your Majesty can give  it me when I have earned it by my services.\"  He was before long sent to  Pignerol, where he passed ten years.  There he met Fouquet, and that  mysterious personage called the Iron Mask, whose name has not yet been  discovered to a certainty by means of all the most ingenious conjectures.  It was only by settling all her property on the Duke of Maine after  herself that Mademoiselle purchased Lauzun's release.  The king had given  his posts to the Prince of Marcillac, son of La Rochefoucauld.  He at the  same time overwhelmed Marshal Bellefonds with kindnesses.    [Illustration: The Iron Mask----14]    \"He sent for him into his study,\" says Madame de Sevigne,--and said to  him, 'Marshal, I want to know why you are anxious to leave me.  Is it a  devout feeling?  Is it a desire for retirement?  Is it the pressure of  your debts?  If the last, I shall be glad to set it right, and enter into  the details of your affairs.'  The marshal was sensibly touched by this  kindness: 'Sir,' said he, 'it is my debts; I am over head and ears.  I cannot see the consequences borne by some of my friends who have  assisted me, and whom I cannot pay.'  'Well,' said the king, 'they must  have security for what is owing to them.  I will give you a hundred  thousand francs on your house at Versailles, and a patent of retainder  (_brevet de retenue_--whereby the emoluments of a post were not lost to  the holder's estate by his death) for four hundred thousand francs, which  will serve as a policy of assurance if you should die; that being so, you  will stay in my service.'  In truth, one must have a very hard heart not  to obey a master who enters with so much kindness into the interests of  one of his domestics; accordingly, the marshal made no objection, and  here he is in his place again, and loaded with benefits.\"    The king entered benevolently into the affairs of a marshal of France; he  paid his debts, and the marshal was his domestic; all the court had come  to that; the duties which brought servants in proximity to the king's  person were eagerly sought after by the greatest lords.  Bontemps, his  chief valet, and Fagon, his physician, as well as his surgeon Marachal,  very excellent men, too, were all-powerful amongst the courtiers.  Louis  XIV. had possessed the art of making his slightest favors prized; to hold  the candlestick at bedtime (_au petit coucher_), to make one in the trips  to Marly, to play in the king's own game, such was the ambition of the  most distinguished; the possessors of grand historic castles, of fine  houses at Paris, crowded together in attics at Versailles, too happy to  obtain a lodging in the palace.  The whole mind of the greatest  personages, his favorites at the head, was set upon devising means of  pleasing the king; Madame de Montespan had pictures painted in miniature  of all the towns he had taken in Holland; they were made into a book  which was worth four thousand pistoles, and of which Racine and Boileau  wrote the text; people of tact, like M. de Langlee, paid court to the  master through those whom he loved.  \"M. de Langlee has given Madame de  Montespan a dress of the most divine material ever imagined; the fairies  did this work in secret, no living soul had any notion of it; and it  seemed good to present it as mysteriously as it had been fashioned.  Madame de Montespan's dressmaker brought her the dress she had ordered of  him; he had made the body a ridiculous fit; there was shrieking and  scolding as you may suppose.  The dressmaker said, all in a tremble, 'As  time presses, madame, see if this other dress that I have here might not  suit you for lack of anything else.'  'Ah! what material!  Does it come  from heaven?  There is none such on earth.'  The body is tried on; it is  a picture.  The king comes in.  The dressmaker says, 'Madame, it is made  for you.'  Everybody sees that it is a piece of gallantry; but on whose  part?  'It is Langl4e,' says the king; 'it is Langlee.'  'Of course,'  says Madame de Montespan, 'none but he could have devised such a device;  it is Langlee, it is Langlee.'  Everybody repeats, 'it is Langlee;' the  echoes are agreed and say, 'it is Langlee;' and as for me, my child, I  tell you, to be in the fashion, 'it is Langlle.' \"    [Illustration: Bed-chamber Etiquette----15]    All the style of living at court was in accordance with the magnificence  of the king and his courtiers; Colbert was beside himself at the sums the  queen lavished on play.  Madame de Montespan lost and won back four  millions, in one night at bassette; Mdlle. de Fontanges gave away twenty  thousand crowns' worth of New Year's gifts; the king had just  accomplished the dauphin's marriage.  \"He made immense presents on this  occasion; there is certainly no need to despair,\""]]]
