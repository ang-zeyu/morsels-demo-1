[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#2)"],[1," noise was--rats. The place  was so infested with them as to be scarce worth living in. There wasn't  a barn or a corn-rick, a store-room or a cupboard, but they ate their  way into it. Not a cheese but they gnawed it hollow, not a sugar  puncheon but they cleared out. Why the very mead and beer in the barrels  was not safe from them. They'd gnaw a hole in the top of the tun, and  down would go one master rat's tail, and when he brought it up round  would crowd all the friends and cousins, and each would have a suck at  the tail.    Had they stopped here it might have been borne. But the squeaking and  shrieking, the hurrying and scurrying, so that you could neither hear  yourself speak nor get a wink of good honest sleep the live-long night!  Not to mention that, Mamma must needs sit up, and keep watch and ward  over baby's cradle, or there'd have been a big ugly rat running across  the poor little fellow's face, and doing who knows what mischief.    Why didn't the good people of the town have cats? Well they did, and  there was a fair stand-up fight, but in the end the rats were too many,  and the pussies were regularly driven from the field. Poison, I hear you  say? Why, they poisoned so many that it fairly bred a plague.  Ratcatchers! Why there wasn't a ratcatcher from John o' Groat's house to  the Land's End that hadn't tried his luck. But do what they might, cats  or poison, terrier or traps, there seemed to be more rats than ever, and  every day a fresh rat was cocking his tail or pricking his whiskers.    The Mayor and the town council were at their wits' end. As they were  sitting one day in the town hall racking their poor brains, and  bewailing their hard fate, who should run in but the town beadle.  \"Please your Honour,\" says he, \"here is a very queer fellow come to  town. I don't rightly know what to make of him.\" \"Show him in,\" said the  Mayor, and in he stepped. A queer fellow, truly. For there wasn't a  colour of the rainbow but you might find it in some corner of his dress,  and he was tall and thin, and had keen piercing eyes.    \"I'm called the Pied Piper,\" he began. \"And pray what might you be  willing to pay me, if I rid you of every single rat in Franchville?\"    Well, much as they feared the rats, they feared parting with their money  more, and fain would they have higgled and haggled. But the Piper was  not a man to stand nonsense, and the upshot was that fifty pounds were  promised him (and it meant a lot of money in those old days) as soon as  not a rat was left to squeak or scurry in Franchville.    Out of the hall stepped the Piper, and as he stepped he laid his pipe to  his lips and a shrill keen tune sounded through street and house. And as  each note pierced the air you might have seen a strange sight. For out  of every hole the rats came tumbling. There were none too old and none  too young, none too big and none too little to crowd at the Piper's  heels and with eager feet and upturned noses to patter after him as he  paced the streets. Nor was the Piper unmindful of the little toddling  ones, for every fifty yards he'd stop and give an extra flourish on his  pipe just to give them time to keep up with the older and stronger of  the band.    Up Silver Street he went, and down Gold Street, and at the end of Gold  Street is the harbour and the broad Solent beyond. And as he paced  along, slowly and gravely, the townsfolk flocked to door and window, and  many a blessing they called down upon his head.    As for getting near him there were too many rats. And now that he was at  the water's edge he stepped into a boat, and not a rat, as he shoved off  into deep water, piping shrilly all the while, but followed him,  plashing, paddling, and wagging their tails with delight. On and on he  played and played until the tide went down, and each master rat sank  deeper and deeper in the slimy ooze of the harbour, until every mother's  son of them was dead and smothered.    The tide rose again, and the Piper stepped on shore, but never a rat  followed. You may fancy the townsfolk had been throwing up their caps  and hurrahing and stopping up rat holes and setting the church bells  a-ringing. But when the Piper stepped ashore and not so much as a single  squeak was to be heard, the Mayor and the Council, and the townsfolk  generally, began to hum and to ha and to shake their heads.    For the town money chest had been sadly emptied of late, and where was  the fifty pounds to come from? Such an easy job, too! Just getting into  a boat and playing a pipe! Why the Mayor himself could have done that if  only he had thought of it.    So he hummed and ha'ad and at last, \"Come, my good man,\" said he, \"you  see what poor folk we are; how can we manage to pay you fifty pounds?  Will you not take twenty? When all is said and done, 't will be good pay  for the trouble you've taken.\"    \"Fifty pounds was what I bargained for,\" said the piper shortly; \"and if  I were you I'd pay it quickly. For I can pipe many kinds of tunes, as  folk sometimes find to their cost.\"    \"Would you threaten us, you strolling vagabond?\" shrieked the Mayor, and  at the same time he winked to the Council; \"the rats are all dead and  drowned,\" muttered he; and so \"You may do your worst, my good man,\" and  with that he turned short upon his heel.    \"Very well,\" said the Piper, and he smiled a quiet smile. With that he  laid his pipe to his lips afresh, but now there came forth no shrill  notes, as it were, of scraping and gnawing, and squeaking and scurrying,  but the tune was joyous and resonant, full of happy laughter and merry  play. And as he paced down the streets the elders mocked, but from  school-room and play-room, from nursery and workshop, not a child but  ran out with eager glee and shout following gaily at the Piper's call.  Dancing, laughing, joining hands and tripping feet, the bright throng  moved along up Gold Street and down Silver Street, and beyond Silver  Street lay the cool green forest full of old oaks and wide-spreading  beeches. In and out among the oak-trees you might catch glimpses of the  Piper's many-coloured coat. You might hear the laughter of the children  break and fade and die away as deeper and deeper into the lone green  wood the stranger went and the children followed.    All the while, the elders watched and waited. They mocked no longer now.  And watch and wait as they might, never did they set their eyes again  upon the Piper in his parti-coloured coat. Never were their hearts  gladdened by the song and dance of the children issuing forth from  amongst the ancient oaks of the forest.          Hereafterthis      Once upon a time there was a farmer called Jan, and he lived all alone  by himself in a little farmhouse.    By-and-by he thought that he would like to have a wife to keep it all  vitty for him.    So he went a-courting a fine maid, and he said to her: \"Will you marry  me?\"    \"That I will, to be sure,\" said she.    So they went to church, and were wed. After the wedding was over, she  got up on his horse behind him, and he brought her home. And they lived  as happy as the day was long.    One day, Jan said to his wife, \"Wife can you milk-y?\"    \"Oh, yes, Jan, I can milk-y. Mother used to milk-y, when I lived home.\"    So he went to market and bought her ten red cows. All went well till one  day when she had driven them to the pond to drink, she thought they did  not drink fast enough. So she drove them right into the pond to make  them drink faster, and they were all drowned.    When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he said,  \"Oh, well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next time.\"    So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, Jan said to his wife,  \"Wife can you serve pigs?\"    \"Oh, yes, Jan, I can serve pigs. Mother used to serve pigs when I lived  home.\"    So Jan went to market and bought her some pigs. All went well till one  day, when she had put their food into the trough she thought they did  not eat fast enough, and she pushed their heads into the trough to make  them eat faster, and they were all choked.    When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he said,  \"Oh, well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next time.\"    So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, Jan said to his wife,  \"Wife can you bake-y?\"    \"Oh, yes, Jan, I can bake-y. Mother used to bake-y when I lived home.\"    So he bought everything for his wife so that she could bake bread. All  went well for a bit, till one day, she thought she would bake white  bread for a treat for Jan. So she carried her meal to the top of a high  hill, and let the wind blow on it, for she thought to herself that the  wind would blow out all the bran. But the wind blew away meal and bran  and all--so there was an end of it.    When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he said,  \"Oh, well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next time.\"    So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, Jan said to his wife,  \"Wife can you brew-y?\"    \"Oh, yes, Jan, I can brew-y. Mother used to brew-y when I lived home.\"    So he bought everything proper for his wife to brew ale with. All went  well for a bit, till one day when she had brewed her ale and put it in  the barrel, a big black dog came in and looked up in her face. She drove  him out of the house, but he stayed outside the door and still looked up  in her face. And she got so angry that she pulled out the plug of the  barrel, threw it at the dog, and said, \"What dost look at me for? I be  Jan's wife.\" Then the dog ran down the road, and she ran after him to  chase him right away. When she came back again, she found that the ale  had all run out of the barrel, and so there was an end of it.    When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he said,  \"Oh well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next time.\"    So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, she thought to herself,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#2)"],[1,"G: PRACTICAL  X.

Intuitions are shy things and apt to disappear  if looked into too closely. And there is undoubtedly a danger that too  much knowledge and training may supplant the natural intuitive feeling  of a student, leaving only a cold knowledge of the means of expression  in its place. For the artist, if he has the right stuff in him, has a  consciousness, in doing his best work, of something, as Ruskin has said,  \"not in him but through him.\" He has been, as it were, but the agent  through which it has found expression.    Talent can be described as \"that which we have,\" and Genius as \"that  which has us.\" Now, although we may have little control over this power  that \"has us,\" and although it may be as well to abandon oneself  unreservedly to its influence, there can be little doubt as to its being  the business of the artist to see to it that his talent be so developed,  that he may prove a fit instrument for the expression of whatever it  may be given him to express; while it must be left to his individual  temperament to decide how far it is advisable to pursue any intellectual  analysis of the elusive things that are the true matter of art.    Provided the student realises this, and that art training can only deal  with the perfecting of a means of expression and that the real matter of  art lies above this and is beyond the scope of teaching, he cannot have  too much of it. For although he must ever be a child before the  influence that moves him, if it is not with the knowledge of the grown  man that he takes off his coat and approaches the craft of painting or  drawing, he will be poorly equipped to make them a means of conveying to  others in adequate form the things he may wish to express. Great things  are only done in art when the creative instinct of the artist has a  well-organised executive faculty at its disposal.           *       *       *       *       *    Of the two divisions into which the technical study of painting can be  divided, namely Form and Colour, we are concerned in this book with Form  alone. But before proceeding to our immediate subject something should  be said as to the nature of art generally, not with the ambition of  arriving at any final result in a short chapter, but merely in order to  give an idea of the point of view from which the following pages are  written, so that misunderstandings may be avoided.    The variety of definitions that exist justifies some inquiry. The  following are a few that come to mind:         \"Art is nature expressed through a personality.\"    But what of architecture? Or music? Then there is Morris's         \"Art is the expression of pleasure in work.\"    But this does not apply to music and poetry. Andrew Lang's         \"Everything which we distinguish from nature\"    seems too broad to catch hold of, while Tolstoy's         \"An action by means of which one man, having experienced a feeling,       intentionally transmits it to others\"    is nearer the truth, and covers all the arts, but seems, from its  omitting any mention of #rhythm#, very inadequate.           *       *       *       *       *    Now the facts of life are conveyed by our senses to the consciousness  within us, and stimulate the world of thought and feeling that  constitutes our real life. Thought and feeling are very intimately  connected, few of our mental perceptions, particularly when they first  dawn upon us, being unaccompanied by some feeling. But there is this  general division to be made, on one extreme of which is what we call  pure intellect, and on the other pure feeling or emotion. The arts, I  take it, are a means of giving expression to the emotional side of this  mental activity, intimately related as it often is to the more purely  intellectual side. The more sensual side of this feeling is perhaps its  lowest, while the feelings associated with the intelligence, the little  sensitivenesses of perception that escape pure intellect, are possibly  its noblest experiences.    Pure intellect seeks to construct from the facts brought to our  consciousness by the senses, an accurately measured world of phenomena,  uncoloured by the human equation in each of us. It seeks to create a  point of view outside the human standpoint, one more stable and  accurate, unaffected by the ever-changing current of human life. It  therefore invents mechanical instruments to do the measuring of our  sense perceptions, as their records are more accurate than human  observation unaided.    But while in science observation is made much more effective by the use  of mechanical instruments in registering facts, the facts with which art  deals, being those of feeling, can only be recorded by the feeling  instrument--man, and are entirely missed by any mechanically devised  substitutes.    The artistic intelligence is not interested in things from this  standpoint of mechanical accuracy, but in the effect of observation on  the living consciousness--the sentient individual in each of us. The  same fact accurately portrayed by a number of artistic intelligences  should be different in each case, whereas the same fact accurately  expressed by a number of scientific intelligences should be the same.    But besides the feelings connected with a wide range of experience, each  art has certain emotions belonging to the"]]]
