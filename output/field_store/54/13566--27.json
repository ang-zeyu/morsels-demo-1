They are not slaves indeed, but they are pariahs; debarred from  all fellowship save with their own despised race--scorned by the lowest  white ruffian in your streets, not tolerated as companions even by the  foreign menials in your kitchen. They are free certainly, but they are  also degraded, rejected, the offscum and the offscouring of the very dregs  of your society; they are free from the chain, the whip, the enforced task  and unpaid toil of slavery; but they are not the less under a ban. Their  kinship with slaves for ever bars them from a full share of the freeman's  inheritance of equal rights, and equal consideration and respect. All  hands are extended to thrust them out, all fingers point at their dusky  skin, all tongues--the most vulgar, as well as the self-styled most  refined--have learnt to turn the very name of their race into an insult  and a reproach. How, in the name of all that is natural, probable,  possible, should the spirit and energy of any human creature support  itself under such an accumulation of injustice and obloquy? Where shall  any mass of men be found with power of character and mind sufficient to  bear up against such a weight of prejudice? Why, if one individual rarely  gifted by heaven were to raise himself out of such a slough of despond, he  would be a miracle; and what would be his reward? Would he be admitted to  an equal share in your political rights?--would he ever be allowed to  cross the threshold of your doors?--would any of you give your daughter to  his son, or your son to his daughter?--would you, in any one particular,  admit him to the footing of equality which any man with a white skin would  claim, whose ability and worth had so raised him from the lower degrees of  the social scale. You would turn from such propositions with abhorrence,  and the servants in your kitchen and stable--the ignorant and boorish  refuse of foreign populations, in whose countries no such prejudice  exists, imbibing it with the very air they breathe here--would shrink from  eating at the same table with such a man, or holding out the hand of  common fellowship to him. Under the species of social proscription in  which the blacks in your Northern cities exist, if they preserved energy  of mind, enterprise of spirit, or any of the best attributes and powers of  free men, they would prove themselves, instead of the lowest and least of  human races, the highest and first, not only of all that do exist, but of  all that ever have existed; for they alone would seek and cultivate  knowledge, goodness, truth, science, art, refinement, and all improvement,  purely for the sake of their own excellence, and without one of those  incentives of honour, power, and fortune, which are found to be the chief,  too often the only, inducements which lead white men to the pursuit of the  same objects.    You know very well dear E----, that in speaking of the free blacks of the  North I here state nothing but what is true and of daily experience. Only  last week I heard, in this very town of Philadelphia, of a family of  strict probity and honour, highly principled, intelligent, well-educated,  and accomplished, and (to speak the world's language) respectable in every  way--i.e. _rich_. Upon an English lady's stating it to be her intention to  visit these persons when she came to Philadelphia, she was told that if  she did nobody else would visit _her_; and she probably would excite a  malevolent feeling, which might find vent in some violent demonstration  against this family. All that I have now said of course bears only upon  the condition of the free coloured population of the North, with which I  am familiar enough to speak confidently of it. As for the slaves, and  their capacity for progress, I can say nothing, for I have never been  among them to judge what faculties their unhappy social position leaves to  them unimpaired. But it seems to me, that no experiment on a sufficiently  large scale can have been tried for a sufficient length of time to  determine the question of their incurable inferiority. Physiologists say  that three successive generations appear to be necessary to produce an  effectual change of constitution (bodily and mental), be it for health or  disease. There are positive physical defects which produce positive mental  ones; the diseases of the muscular and nervous systems descend from father  to son. Upon the agency of one corporal power how much that is not  corporal depends; from generation to generation internal disease and  external deformity, vices, virtues, talents, and deficiencies are  transmitted, and by the action of the same law it must be long indeed  before the offspring of slaves--creatures begotten of a race debased and  degraded to the lowest degree, themselves born in slavery, and whose  progenitors have eaten the bread and drawn the breath of slavery for  years--can be measured, with any show of justice, by even the least  favoured descendants of European nations, whose qualities have been for  centuries developing themselves under the beneficent influence of freedom,  and the progress it inspires.    I am rather surprised at the outbreak of violent disgust which Mr. ----  indulges in on the subject of amalgamation; as that formed no part of  our discussion, and seems to me a curious subject for abstract argument. I  should think the intermarrying between blacks and whites a matter to be as  little insisted upon if repugnant, as prevented if agreeable to the  majority of the two races. At the same time, I cannot help being  astonished at the furious and ungoverned execration which all reference to  the possibility of a fusion of the races draws down upon those who suggest  it; because nobody pretends to deny that, throughout the South, a large  proportion of the population is the offspring of white men and coloured  women. In New Orleans, a class of unhappy females exists whose mingled  blood does not prevent their being remarkable for their beauty, and with  whom no man, no _gentleman_, in that city shrinks from associating; and  while the slaveowners of the Southern States insist vehemently upon the  mental and physical inferiority of the blacks, they are benevolently doing  their best, in one way at least, to raise and improve the degraded race,  and the bastard population which forms so ominous an element in the social  safety of their cities certainly exhibit in their forms and features the  benefit they derive from their white progenitors. It is hard to conceive  that some mental improvement does not accompany this physical change.  Already the finer forms of the European races are cast in these dusky  moulds: the outward configuration can hardly thus improve without  corresponding progress in the inward capacities. The white man's blood and  bones have begotten this bronze race, and bequeathed to it in some degree  qualities, tendencies, capabilities, such as are the inheritance of the  highest order of human animals. Mr. ---- (and many others) speaks as if  there were a natural repugnance in all whites to any alliance with the  black race; and yet it is notorious, that almost every Southern planter  has a family more or less numerous of illegitimate coloured children. Most  certainly, few people would like to assert that such connections are  formed because it is the _interest_ of these planters to increase the  number of their human property, and that they add to their revenue by the  closest intimacy with creatures that they loathe, in order to reckon  among their wealth the children of their body. Surely that is a monstrous  and unnatural supposition, and utterly unworthy of belief. That such  connections exist commonly, is a sufficient proof that they are not  abhorrent to nature; but it seems, indeed, as if marriage (and not  concubinage) was the horrible enormity which cannot be tolerated, and  against which, moreover, it has been deemed expedient to enact laws. Now  it appears very evident that there is no law in the white man's nature  which prevents him from making a coloured woman the mother of his  children, but there _is_ a law on his statute books forbidding him to make  her his wife; and if we are to admit the theory that the mixing of the  races is a monstrosity, it seems almost as curious that laws should be  enacted to prevent men marrying women towards whom they have an invincible  natural repugnance, as that education should by law be prohibited to  creatures incapable of receiving it. As for the exhortation with which  Mr. ---- closes his letter, that I will not 'go down to my husband's  plantation prejudiced against what I am to find there,' I know not well  how to answer it. Assuredly I _am_ going prejudiced against slavery, for I  am an Englishwoman, in whom the absence of such a prejudice would be  disgraceful. Nevertheless, I go prepared to find many mitigations in the  practice to the general injustice and cruelty of the system--much kindness  on the part of the masters, much content on that of the slaves; and I feel  very sure that you may rely upon the carefulness of my observation, and  the accuracy of my report, of every detail of the working of the thing  that comes under my notice; and certainly, on the plantation to which I am  going, it will be more likely that I should some things extenuate, than  set down aught in malice.

CHAPTER I    THE EUROPEAN DISCOVERY OF AMERICA      [Sidenote: Leif Ericson.]    1. Leif Ericson discovers America, 1000.--In our early childhood  many of us learned to repeat the lines:--         Columbus sailed the ocean blue       In fourteen hundred, ninety-two.    [Sidenote: Leif discovers America, 1000. _Higginson_, 25-30; _American  History Leaflets_, No. 3.]    We thought that he was the first European to visit America. But nearly  five hundred years before his time Leif Ericson had discovered the New  World. He was a Northman and the son of Eric the Red. Eric had already  founded a colony in Greenland, and Leif sailed from Norway to make him a  visit. This was in the year 1000. Day after day Leif and his men were  tossed about on the sea until they reached an unknown land where they  found many grape-vines. They called it Vinland or Wineland. They Then  sailed northward and reached Greenland in safety. Precisely where  Vinland was is not known. But it certainly was part of North America.  Leif Ericson, the Northman, was therefore the real discoverer  of America.    [Illustration: EUROPE, ICELAND, GREENLAND, AND NORTH AMERICA.]    [Sidenote: Marco Polo, Cathay, and Cipango.]    2. Early European Travelers.--The people of Europe knew more of the  lands of Asia than they knew of Vinland. For hundreds of years  missionaries, traders, and travelers visited the Far East. They brought  back to Europe silks and spices, and ornaments of gold and of silver.  They told marvelous tales of rich lands and great princes. One of these  travelers was a Venetian named Marco Polo. He told of Cathay or China  and of Cipango or Japan. This last country was an island. Its king was  so rich that even the floors of his palaces were of pure gold. Suddenly  the Turks conquered the lands between Europe and the golden East. They  put an end to this trading and traveling. New ways to India, China, and  Japan must be found.    [Sidenote: Portuguese seamen.]    3. Early Portuguese Sailors.--One way to the East seemed to be  around the southern end of Africa--if it should turn out that there was  a southern end to that Dark Continent. In 1487 Portuguese seamen sailed  around the southern end of Africa and, returning home, called that point  the Cape of Storms. But the King of Portugal thought that now there was  good hope of reaching India by sea. So he changed the name to Cape of  Good Hope. Ten years later a brave Portuguese sailor, Vasco da Gama,  actually reached India by the Cape of Good Hope, and returned safely to  Portugal (1497).    [Sidenote: Columbus and his beliefs. _Higginson, 31-35; Eggleston, 1-3;  American History Leaflets_, No. 1.]    4. Columbus.--Meantime Christopher Columbus, an Italian, had  returned from an even more startling voyage. From what he had read, and  from what other men had told him, he had come to believe that the earth  was round. If this were really true, Cipango and Cathay were west of  Europe as well as east of Europe. Columbus also believed that the earth  was very much smaller than it really is, and that Cipango was only three  thousand miles west of Spain. For a time people laughed at the idea of  sailing westward to Cipango and Cathay. But at length Columbus secured  enough money to fit out a little fleet.    [Sidenote: Columbus reaches America, 1492. _Higginson, 35-37; Eggleston,  3-5_.]    5. The Voyage, 1492.--Columbus left Spain in August, 1492, and,  refitting at the Canaries, sailed westward into the Sea of Darkness. At  ten o'clock in the evening of October 20, 1492, looking out into the  night, he saw a light in the distance. The fleet was soon stopped. When  day broke, there, sure enough, was land. A boat was lowered, and  Columbus, going ashore, took possession of the new land for Ferdinand  and Isabella, King and Queen of Aragon and Castile. The natives came to  see the discoverers. They were reddish in color and interested  Columbus--for were they not inhabitants of the Far East? So he called  them Indians.    [Illustration: SHIPS, SEA-MONSTERS, AND INDIANS. From an early Spanish  book on America.]    [Sidenote: The Indians, _Higginson, 13-24; Eggleston, 71-76_.]    [Sidenote: Columbus discovers Cuba.]    6. The Indians and the Indies.--These Indians were not at all like  those wonderful people of Cathay and Cipango whom Marco Polo had  described. Instead of wearing clothes of silk and of gold embroidered  satin, these people wore no clothes of any kind. But it was plain enough  that the island they had found was not Cipango. It was probably some  island off the coast of Cipango, so on Columbus sailed and discovered  Cuba. He was certain that Cuba was a part of the mainland of Asia, for  the Indians kept saying \"Cubanaquan.\" Columbus thought that this was  their way of pronouncing Kublai Khan--the name of a mighty eastern  ruler. So he sent two messengers with a letter to that powerful monarch.  Returning to Spain, Columbus was welcomed as a great admiral. He made  three other voyages to America. But he never came within sight of the  mainland of the United States.    [Sidenote: John Cabot visits North America, 1497. _Higginson, 40-42;  Eggleston, 8-10; American History Leaflets_, No. 9.]    7. John Cabot, 1497.--While Columbus explored the West Indies,  another Italian sailed across the Sea of Darkness farther north. His  name was John Cabot, and he sailed with a license from Henry VII of  England, the first of the Tudor kings. Setting boldly forth from  Bristol, England, he crossed the North Atlantic and reached the coast of  America north of Nova Scotia. Like Columbus, he thought that he had  found the country of the Grand Khan. Upon his discovery English kings  based their claim to the right to colonize North America.    [Sidenote: Americus Vespucius, his voyages and books. _Higginson_,  37-38; _Eggleston_, 7-8.]    [Sidenote: The New World named America.]    8. The Naming of America.--Many other explorers also visited the  new-found lands. Among these was an Italian named Americus Vespucius.  Precisely where he went is not clear. But it is clear that he wrote  accounts of his voyages, which were printed and read by many persons. In  these accounts he said that what we call South America was not a part of  Asia. So he named it the New World. Columbus all the time was declaring  that the lands he had found were a part of Asia. It was natural,  therefore, that people in thinking of the New World should think of  Americus Vespucius. Before long some one even suggested that the New  World should be named America in his honor. This was done, and when it  became certain that the other lands were not parts of Asia, the name  America was given to them also until the whole continent came to be  called America.    [Illustration: AMERICUS VESPUCIUS.]    [Sidenote: Balboa sees the Pacific, 1513.]    [Sidenote: Magellan's great voyage, 1520. _Eggleston_, 10-11.]    9. Balboa and Magellan, 1513, 1520.--Balboa was a Spaniard who came  to San Domingo to seek his fortune. He became a pauper and fled away  from those to whom he owed money. After long wanderings he found  himself on a high mountain in the center of the Isthmus of Panama. To  the southward sparkled the waters of a new sea. He called it the South  Sea. Wading into it waist deep, he waved his sword in the air and took  possession of it for his royal master, the King of Spain. This was in  1513. Seven years later, in 1520, Magellan, a Portuguese seaman in the  service of the Spanish king, sailed through the Straits of Magellan and  entered the same great ocean, which he called the Pacific. Thence  northward and westward he sailed day after day, week after week, and  month after month, until he reached the Philippine Islands. The natives  killed Magellan. But one of his vessels found her way back to Spain  around the Cape of Good Hope.          CHAPTER 2    SPANISH AND FRENCH PIONEERS IN THE UNITED STATES    [Sidenote: Indian traditions.]    10. Stories of Golden Lands.--Wherever the Spaniards went, the  Indians always told them stories of golden lands somewhere else. The  Bahama Indians, for instance, told their cruel Spanish masters of a  wonderful land toward the north. Not only was there gold in that land;  there was also a fountain whose waters restored youth and vigor to the  drinker. Among the fierce Spanish soldiers was Ponce de Leon (Pon'tha da  la-on'). He determined to see for himself if these stories were true.    [Sidenote: De Leon visits Florida, 1513. _Higginson_, 42.]    [Sidenote: De Leon's death.]    11. Discovery of Florida, 1513.--In the same year that Balboa  discovered the Pacific Ocean, Ponce de Leon sailed northward and  westward from the Bahamas. On Easter Sunday, 1513, he anchored off the  shores of a new land. The Spanish name for Easter was La Pascua de los  Flores. So De Leon called the new land Florida. For the Spaniards were a  very religious people and usually named their lands and settlements from  saints or religious events. De Leon then sailed around the southern end  of Florida and back to the West Indies. In 1521 he again visited  Florida, was wounded by an Indian arrow, and returned home to die.
