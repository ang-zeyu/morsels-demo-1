But  my duty to my neighbour is much more nearly expressed by saying that  I have to make him happy--if I may.          III      Happiness and goodness, according to canting moralists, stand in the  relation of effect and cause. There was never anything less proved or  less probable: our happiness is never in our own hands; we inherit our  constitution; we stand buffet among friends and enemies; we may be so  built as to feel a sneer or an aspersion with unusual keenness, and so  circumstanced as to be unusually exposed to them; we may have nerves  very sensitive to pain, and be afflicted with a disease very painful.  Virtue will not help us, and it is not meant to help us. It is not even  its own reward, except for the self-centred and--I had almost said--the  unamiable. No man can pacify his conscience; if quiet be what he want,  he shall do better to let that organ perish from disuse. And to avoid  the penalties of the law, and the minor _capitis diminutio_ of social  ostracism, is an affair of wisdom--of cunning, if you will--and not of  virtue.    In his own life, then, a man is not to expect happiness, only to profit  by it gladly when it shall arise; he is on duty here; he knows not how  or why, and does not need to know; he knows not for what hire, and must  not ask. Somehow or other, though he does not know what goodness is, he  must try to be good; somehow or other, though he cannot tell what will  do it, he must try to give happiness to others. And no doubt there comes  in here a frequent clash of duties. How far is he to make his neighbour  happy? How far must he respect that smiling face, so easy to cloud, so  hard to brighten again? And how far, on the other side, is he bound to  be his brother's keeper and the prophet of his own morality? How far  must he resent evil?    The difficulty is that we have little guidance; Christ's sayings on the  point being hard to reconcile with each other, and (the most of them)  hard to accept. But the truth of his teaching would seem to be this: in  our own person and fortune, we should be ready to accept and to pardon  all; it is _our_ cheek we are to turn, _r_ coat that we are to give  away to the man who has taken _our_ cloak. But when another's face is  buffeted, perhaps a little of the lion will become us best. That we are  to suffer others to be injured, and stand by, is not conceivable and  surely not desirable. Revenge, says Bacon, is a kind of wild justice;  its judgments at least are delivered by an insane judge; and in our  own quarrel we can see nothing truly and do nothing wisely. But in the  quarrel of our neighbour, let us be more bold. One person's happiness  is as sacred as another's; when we cannot defend both, let us defend  one with a stout heart. It is only in so far as we are doing this, that  we have any right to interfere: the defence of B is our only ground of  action against A. A has as good a right to go to the devil, as we to go  to glory; and neither knows what he does.    The truth is that all these interventions and denunciations and militant  mongerings of moral half-truths, though they be sometimes needful,  though they are often enjoyable, do yet belong to an inferior grade of  duties. Ill-temper and envy and revenge find here an arsenal of pious  disguises; this is the playground of inverted lusts. With a little more  patience and a little less temper, a gentler and wiser method might be  found in almost every case; and the knot that we cut by some fine  heady quarrel-scene in private life, or, in public affairs, by some  denunciatory act against what we are pleased to call our neighbour's  vices, might yet have been unwoven by the hand of sympathy.          IV      To look back upon the past year, and see how little we have striven  and to what small purpose: and how often we have been cowardly and  hung back, or temerarious and rushed unwisely in; and how every day  and all day long we have transgressed the law of kindness;--it may  seem a paradox, but in the bitterness of these discoveries, a certain  consolation resides. Life is not designed to minister to a man's vanity.  He goes upon his long business most of the time with a hanging head, and  all the time like a blind child. Full of rewards and pleasures as it  is--so that to see the day break or the moon rise, or to meet a friend,  or to hear the dinner-call when he is hungry, fills him with surprising  joys--this world is yet for him no abiding city. Friendships fall  through, health fails, weariness assails him; year after year, he must  thumb the hardly varying record of his own weakness and folly. It is a  friendly process of detachment. When the time comes that he should go,  there need be few illusions left about himself. _Here lies one who meant  well, tried a little, failed much_:--surely that may be his epitaph, of  which he need not be ashamed. Nor will he complain at the summons which  calls a defeated soldier from the field: defeated, ay, if he were Paul  or Marcus Aurelius!--but if there is still one inch of fight in his old  spirit, undishonoured. The faith which sustained him in his life-long  blindness and life-long disappointment will scarce even be required in  this last formality of laying down his arms. Give him a march with his  old bones; there, out of the glorious sun-coloured earth, out of the day  and the dust and the ecstasy--there goes another Faithful Failure!    From a recent book of verse, where there is more than one such beautiful  and manly poem, I take this memorial piece: it says better than I can,  what I love to think; let it be our parting word.        \"A late lark twitters from the quiet skies;      And from the west,      Where the sun, his day's work ended,      Lingers as in content,      There falls on the old, gray city      An influence luminous and serene,      A shining peace.        \"The smoke ascends      In a rosy-and-golden haze. The spires      Shine, and are changed. In the valley      Shadows rise. The lark sings on. The sun,      Closing his benediction,      Sinks, and the darkening air      Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night--      Night, with her train of stars      And her great gift of sleep.        \"So be my passing!      My task accomplished and the long day done,      My wages taken, and in my heart      Some late lark singing,      Let me be gathered to the quiet west,      The sundown splendid and serene,      Death.\"[2]    [1888.]    [Footnote 2: From _A Book of Verses_ by William Ernest Henley. D. Nutt,  1888.]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#2)"],[1," he had found employment. He made several voyages  as sailing-master in 1805-8 from that port. He was apparently during  these years successful after the manner of his craft. But he was not a  man to remain long in one place. What was the immediate occasion of his  strange behavior we can only conjecture. Possibly an increasing love for  liquor had led to domestic differences, which his pleasure-loving nature  would not brook. Certain it was that he was not like his wife. He was  not a man in whom the moral sense was uppermost. He was governed by  impulse and she by fixed moral and religious principles. He drank and  she abhorred the habit. She tried first moral suasion to induce him to  abandon the habit, and once, in a moment of wifely and motherly  indignation, she broke up one of his drinking parties in her house by  trying the efficacy of a little physical suasion. She turned the company  out of doors and smashed the bottles of liquor. This was not the kind of  woman whom Abijah cared to live with as a wife. He was not the sort of  man whom the most romantic love could attach to the apron-strings of any  woman. And in the matter of his cup he probably saw that this was what  he would be obliged to do as the condition of domestic peace. The  condition he rejected and, rejecting it, rejected and cast-off his wife  and family and the legal and moral responsibilities of husband and  father.    Bitter days now followed and Fanny Garrison became acquainted with grief  and want. She had the mouths of three children to fill--the youngest an  infant at her breast. The battle of this broken-hearted woman for their  daily bread was as heroic as it was pathetic. She still lived in the  little house on School street where Lloyd was born. The owner, Martha  Farnham, proved herself a friend indeed to the poor harassed soul. Now  she kept the wolf from the door by going out as a monthly nurse--\"Aunt  Farnham\" looking after the little ones in her absence. She was put to  all her possibles during those anxious years of struggle and want. Even  Lloyd, wee bit of a boy, was pressed into the service. She would make  molasses candies and send him upon the streets to sell them. But with  all her industry and resource what could she do with three children  weighing her down in the fierce struggle for existence, rendered tenfold  fiercer after the industrial crisis preceding and following the War of  1812. Then it was that she was forced to supplement her scant earnings  with refuse food from the table of \"a certain mansion on State street.\"  It was Lloyd who went for this food, and it was he who had to run the  gauntlet of mischievous and inquisitive children whom he met and who  longed for a peep into his tin pail. But the future apostle of  non-resistance was intensely resistant, we may be sure, on such  occasions. For, as his children have said in the story of his life:  \"Lloyd was a thorough boy, fond of games and of all boyish sport.  Barefooted, he trundled his hoop all over Newburyport; he swam in the  Merrimac in summer, and skated on it in winter; he was good at sculling  a boat; he played at bat and ball and snowball, and sometimes led the  'Southend boys' against the Northenders in the numerous conflicts  between the youngsters of the two sections; he was expert with marbles.  Once, with a playmate, he swam across the river to 'Great Rock,' a  distance of three-fourths of a mile and effected his return against the  tide; and once, in winter, he nearly lost his life by breaking through  the ice on the river and reached the shore only after a desperate  struggle, the ice yielding as often as he attempted to climb upon its  surface. It was favorite pastime of the boys of that day to swim from  one wharf to another adjacent, where vessels from the West Indies  discharged their freight of molasses, and there to indulge in stolen  sweetness, extracted by a smooth stick inserted through the bung-hole.  When detected and chased, they would plunge into the water and escape to  the wharf on which they had left their clothes.\" Such was the little man  with a boy's irrepressible passion for frolic and fun. His passion for  music was hardly less pronounced, and this he inherited from his mother,  and exercised to his heart's content in the choir of the Baptist Church.  These were the bright lines and spots in his strenuous young life. He  played and sang the gathering brood of cares out of his own and his  mother's heart. He needed to play and he needed to sing to charm away  from his spirit the vulture of poverty. That evil bird hovered ever over  his childhood. It was able to do many hard things to him, break up his  home, sunder him from his mother, force him at a tender age to earn his  bread, still there was another bird in the boy's heart, which sang out  of it the shadow and into it the sunshine. Whatever was his lot there  sang the bird within his breast, and there shone the sun over his head  and into his soul. The boy had unconsciously drawn around him a circle  of sunbeams, and how could the vulture of poverty strike him with its  wings or stab him with its beak. When he was about eight he was parted  from his mother, she going to Lynn, and he, wee mite of a man, remaining  in Newburyport. It was during the War of 1812, and pinching times, when  Fanny Garrison was at her wit's end to keep the wolf from devouring her  three little ones and herself into the bargain. With what tearing of the  heart-strings she left Lloyd and his little sister Elizabeth behind we  can now only imagine. She had no choice, poor soul, for unless she  toiled they would starve. So with James, her eldest son, she went forth  into the world to better theirs and her own condition. Lloyd went to  live in Deacon Ezekiel Bartlett's family. They were good to the little  fellow, but they, too, were poor. The Deacon, among other things, sawed  wood for a living, and Lloyd hardly turned eight years, followed him in  his peregrinations from house to house doing with his tiny hands what he  could to help the kind old man. Soon Fanny Lloyd's health, which had  supported her as a magic staff in all those bitter years since Abijah's  desertion of wife and children, began in the battle for bread in Lynn,  to fail her. And so, in her weakness, and with a great fear in her heart  for her babies, when she was gone from them into the dark unknown  forever, she bethought her of making them as fast as possible  self-supporting. And what better way was there than to have the boys  learn some trade. James she had already apprenticed to learn the mystery  of shoemaking. And for Lloyd she now sent and apprenticed him, too, to  the same trade. Oh! but it was hard for the little man, the heavy  lapstone and all this thumping and pounding to make a shoe. Oh! how the  stiff waxen threads cut into his soft fingers, how all his body ached  with the constrained position and the rough work of shoemaking. But one  day the little nine-year-old, who was \"not much bigger than a last,\" was  able to produce a real shoe. Then it was probably that a dawning  consciousness of power awoke within the child's mind. He himself by  patience and industry had created a something where before was nothing.  The eye of the boy got for the first time a glimpse of the man, who was  still afar off, shadowy in the dim approaches of the hereafter. But the  work proved altogether beyond the strength of the boy. The shoemaker's  bench was not his place, and the making of shoes for his kind was not  the mission for which he was sent into the world. And now again poverty,  the great scene-shifter, steps upon the stage, and Fanny Lloyd and her  two boys are in Baltimore on that never-ending quest for bread. She had  gone to work in a shoe factory established by an enterprising Yankee in  that city. The work lasted but a few months, when the proprietor failed  and the factory was closed. In a strange city mother and children were  left without employment. In her anxiety and distress a new trouble, the  greatest and most poignant since Abijah's desertion, wrung her with a  supreme grief. James, the light and pride of her life, had run away from  his master and gone to sea. Lloyd, poor little homesick Lloyd, was the  only consolation left the broken heart. And he did not want to live in  Baltimore, and longed to return to Newburyport. So, mindful of her  child's happiness, and all unmindful of her own, she sent him from her  to Newburyport, which he loved inexpressibly. He was now in his eleventh  year. Very happy he was to see once more the streets and landmarks of  the old town--the river, and the old house where he was born, and the  church next door and the school-house across the way and the dear  friends whom he loved and who loved him. He went again to live with the  Bartletts, doing with his might all that he could to earn his daily  bread, and to repay the kindness of the dear old deacon and his family.  It was at this time that he received his last scrap of schooling. He  was, as we have seen, but eleven, but precious little of that brief and  tender time had he been able to spend in a school-house. He had gone to  the primary school, where, as his children tell us, he did not show  himself \"an apt scholar, being slow in mastering the alphabet, and  surpassed even by his little sister Elizabeth.\" During his stay with  Deacon Bartlett the first time, he was sent three months to the  grammar-school, and now on his return to this good friend, a few more  weeks were added to his scant school term. They proved the last of his  school-days, and the boy went forth from the little brick building on  the Mall to finish his education in the great workaday world, under  those stern old masters, poverty and experience. By and by Lloyd was a  second time apprenticed to learn a trade. It was to a cabinetmaker in  Haverhill, Mass. He made good progress in the craft, but his young heart  still turned to"]]]
