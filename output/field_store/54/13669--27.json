Be provided at all times with a large-sized blotter, and when  writing, keep this under the hand. Do not attempt to write with a  single sheet of paper on a bare table or desk; there should be many  sheets of paper underneath, in order to make an elastic surface.      STUDY WITH PRACTICE.    Aimless, indifferent, or careless practice, never made a good writer,  and never will. In order to succeed in this, as in other things, there  must be will and determination to succeed, and then persevering and  studious effort. Study the models until their forms are fixed in the  mind.    [Illustration: Study gives form]    No one can execute that which he does not clearly conceive. The artist  must first see the picture on the white canvas, before he can paint  it, and the sculptor must be able to see in the rough and uninviting  stone, the outlines of the beautiful image which he is to carve. In  writing, a clear idea of the formation of the different letters,  and their various proportions, must become familiar by proper study,  examination and analysis. Study precedes practice. It is, of course,  not necessary, nor even well, to undertake the mastery of all the  forms in writing, by study, until some have been executed. It is  best that each form should, as it is taken up, be first measured and  analyzed and then practiced at once.    [Illustration: Practice gives grace]    It is the act which crowns the thought. After study, careful and  earnest practice can hardly fail to make a good writer of any one.  Some persons secure a good style of penmanship with less labor than  others, and attain to the elegant, and beautiful formation. But it  is only fair to presume that no greater diversity of talent exists  in this direction than in the study of other things. All do not learn  arithmetic or history with like ease, but no one will assert that all  who will, may not learn arithmetic or history. And so, all who will  put forth the proper exertion in study and practice may learn to write  a good business style, while many of the number will attain to the  elegant. The conditions of practice in writing are, _Positions of the  Body, Position of the Hand an Pen, and Movement_.          [Illustration: Position of the Body]    POSITION of the BODY.      Sitting squarely fronting the desk, with feet placed firmly on the  floor, and both arms on the desk, is, as a rule, the best position for  practice in writing, or correspondence. The right side, may, however,  be placed to the desk, with the right arm, only, resting thereon, and  some persons prefer this position. Avoid crossing the feet, sitting  on the edge of the chair, or assuming any careless attitude. The body  should be erect, but slightly inclined forward, in order that the eye  may follow the pen closely. This position will never cause curvature  of the spine. The body should never be allowed to settle down into a  cramped and unhealthy position with the face almost on the paper.  By thus compressing the lungs and the digestive organs they are soon  injured, and if the stomach lose its tone, the eyesight is impaired,  there is such a close sympathy between these organs of the body. The  practice of writing should be, and properly is, a healthful exercise,  and injurious effects result only from improper positions of the body,  at variance with good writing as well as good health.    When wearied by sitting and the effort at writing, lay aside paper and  pen, arise from the chair, and take exercise and rest by walking about  the room or in the open air. Then come back refreshed, and vigorous,  for the practice of writing.    In general, the light should fall on the paper from the left side,  thus enabling a writer to clearly see the ruled lines, and render the  labor of writing easier and more rapid. If one writes left-handed, of  course He will sit so as to get his light from the right side, or over  the right shoulder.      SHADING.    As a beautifier of the handwriting, by causing a diversity of light  and shade among the letters, shading has its value; but in the  practical handwriting for business purposes, it should, as a rule, be  classed with flourishing, and left out. Requiring time and effort, to  bring down the shades on letters, business men, clerks and telegraph  operators find a uniform and regular style of writing, without shade,  the best, even though it may not be as artistic.      UNIFORMITY.    A most necessary element in all good penmanship is uniformity. In the  slope of the letters and words which form a written page there must be  no disagreement. With the letters leaning about in various directions,  writing is presented in its most ridiculous phase. Uniformity in the  size of letters, throughout the written page; how greatly it conduces  to neatness and beauty. All letters resting on the line, and being of  uniform hight, adds another condition towards good penmanship. This  essential element of uniformity may be watched and guarded closely and  cultivated by any learner in his own practice.      SLANT OF WRITING.    As said before, it matters not so much what angle of slant is adopted  in writing, provided it is made uniform, and all letters are required  to conform exactly to the same slant. Writing which is nearest  perpendicular is most legible, and hence is preferable for business  purposes. The printed page of perpendicular type; how legible it is.  But for ease in execution, writing should slant. It follows then that  writing should be made as perpendicular as is consistent with ease of  execution. The slant of writing should not be less than sixty degrees  from the horizontal.          [Illustration: Position of Body While Standing]    POSITION of the BODY WHILE STANDING.      The practical book-keeper finds it advantageous to do his writing  while standing; in fact, where large books are in use, and entries are  to be transferred from one to another, the work of the book-keeper  can hardly be performed otherwise than in a standing position, free to  move about his office. Cumbrous books necessitate a different position  at the desk, from that of the correspondent, or the learner. Since  large books must lie squarely on the desk, the writer, in order to  have the proper position thereto, must place his left side to the  desk. The body thus has the same relative position, as if squarely  fronting the desk with the paper or book placed diagonally. In other  words, the writer, while engaged in writing in large, heavy books,  must adjust himself to the position of the books. Should the  correspondent or bill clerk perform his work while standing, he would  assume the same as the sitting position--squarely fronting the desk.      LEGIBILITY.    Children, in learning to write, are apt to sacrifice all other  good qualities of beauty, regularity and grace, for the quality of  legibility, or plainness. With some older persons this legibility is  considered of very little consequence, and is obscured by all manner  of meaningless flourishes, in which the writer takes pride. In the  estimation of the business man, writing is injured by shades and  flourishes. The demand of this practical time is a plain, regular  style that can be written rapidly, and read at a glance.    [Illustration]      FINISH.    By a careless habit, which many persons allow themselves to fall into,  they omit to attend to the little things in writing. Good penmanship  consists in attention to small details, each letter and word correctly  formed, makes the beautiful page. By inattention to the finish of one  letter, or part of a letter of a word, oftentimes the word is mistaken  for another, and the entire meaning changed. Particular attention  should be devoted to the finish of some of the small letters, such as  the dotting of the i, or crossing of the t. Blending the lines which  form a loop, often causes the letter to become a stem, similar to the  t or d, or an e to become an i. In many of the capital letters, the  want of attention to the finish of the letter converts it into another  or destroys its identity, such, for instance, as the small cross on  the capital F, which, if left off, makes the letter a T. The W often  becomes an M, or _vice versa_, and the I a J. Mistakes in this regard  are more the result of carelessness and inattention than anything  else. By careful practice a person will acquire a settled habit of  giving a perfection to each letter and word, and then it is no longer  a task, but is performed naturally and almost involuntarily, while  the difference in the appearance of the written page, as well as the  exactness and certainty of the meaning conveyed, may be incalculably  great.    While practicing penmanship, or while endeavoring to correct a  careless habit in writing, the mind must be upon the work in hand,  and not be allowed to wander into fields of thought or imagination;  by thus confining the attention, any defect or imperfection in the  formation of letters may be soon mastered or corrected.          [Illustration: Position of the Hand and Pen.]    POSITION OF THE HAND AND PEN      The right arm should rest on the muscles just below the elbow, and  wrist should be elevated so as to move free from paper and desk. Turn  the hand so that the wrist will be level, or so that the back of  the hand will face the ceiling. The third and fourth fingers turned  slightly underneath the hand will form its support, and the pen, these  fingers and the muscles of the arm near the elbow form the only points  of rest or contact on desk or paper. The pen should point over the  shoulder, and should be so held that it may pass the root of the nail  on the second finger, and about opposite the knuckle of the hand. An  unnatural or cramped position of the hand, like such a position of the  body, is opposed to good writing, and after many years of observation  and study, all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14107"],[0,"The Lost Stradivarius (#2)"],[1," attracted by the sound  of the violin, or that Mr. Gaskell himself had returned. With the  cessation of the music an absolute stillness fell upon all; the light of  the single candle scarcely reached the darker corners of the room, but  fell directly on the wicker chair and showed it to be perfectly empty.  Half amused, half vexed with himself at having without reason  interrupted his music, my brother returned to the _Gagliarda_; but some  impulse induced him to light the candles in the sconces, which gave an  illumination more adequate to the occasion. The _Gagliarda_ and the last  movement, a _Minuetto_, were finished, and John closed the book,  intending, as it was now late, to seek his bed. As he shut the pages a  creaking of the wicker chair again attracted his attention, and he heard  distinctly sounds such as would be made by a person raising himself from  a sitting posture. This time, being less surprised, he could more aptly  consider the probable causes of such a circumstance, and easily arrived  at the conclusion that there must be in the wicker chair osiers  responsive to certain notes of the violin, as panes of glass in church  windows are observed to vibrate in sympathy with certain tones of the  organ. But while this argument approved itself to his reason, his  imagination was but half convinced; and he could not but be impressed  with the fact that the second creaking of the chair had been coincident  with his shutting the music-book; and, unconsciously, pictured to  himself some strange visitor waiting until the termination of the music,  and then taking his departure.    His conjectures did not, however, either rob him of sleep or even  disturb it with dreams, and he woke the next morning with a cooler mind  and one less inclined to fantastic imagination. If the strange episode  of the previous evening had not entirely vanished from his mind, it  seemed at least fully accounted for by the acoustic explanation to which  I have alluded above. Although he saw Mr. Gaskell in the course of the  morning, he did not think it necessary to mention to him so trivial a  circumstance, but made with him an appointment to sup together in his  own rooms that evening, and to amuse themselves afterwards by essaying  some of the Italian music.    It was shortly after nine that night when, supper being finished, Mr.  Gaskell seated himself at the piano and John tuned his violin. The  evening was closing in; there had been heavy thunder-rain in the  afternoon, and the moist air hung now heavy and steaming, while across  it there throbbed the distant vibrations of the tenor bell at Christ  Church. It was tolling the customary 101 strokes, which are rung every  night in term-time as a signal for closing the college gates. The two  young men enjoyed themselves for some while, playing first a suite by  Cesti, and then two early sonatas by Buononcini. Both of them were  sufficiently expert musicians to make reading at sight a pleasure rather  than an effort; and Mr. Gaskell especially was well versed in the theory  of music, and in the correct rendering of the _basso continuo_. After  the Buononcini Mr. Gaskell took up the oblong copy of Graziani, and  turning over its leaves, proposed that they should play the same suite  which John had performed by himself the previous evening. His selection  was apparently perfectly fortuitous, as my brother had purposely  refrained from directing his attention in any way to that piece of  music. They played the _Coranto_ and the _Sarabanda_, and in the  singular fascination of the music John had entirely forgotten the  episode of the previous evening, when, as the bold air of the  _Gagliarda_ commenced, he suddenly became aware of the same strange  creaking of the wicker chair that he had noticed on the first occasion.  The sound was identical, and so exact was its resemblance to that of a  person sitting down that he stared at the chair, almost wondering that  it still appeared empty. Beyond turning his head sharply for a moment to  look round, Mr. Gaskell took no notice of the sound; and my brother,  ashamed to betray any foolish interest or excitement, continued the  _Gagliarda_, with its repeat. At its conclusion Mr. Gaskell stopped  before proceeding to the minuet, and turning the stool on which he was  sitting round towards the room, observed, \"How very strange,  Johnnie,\"--for these young men were on terms of sufficient intimacy to  address each other in a familiar style,--\"How very strange! I thought I  heard some one sit down in that chair when we began the _Gagliarda_. I  looked round quite expecting to see some one had come in. Did you hear  nothing?\"    \"It was only the chair creaking,\" my brother answered, feigning an  indifference which he scarcely felt. \"Certain parts of the wicker-work  seem to be in accord with musical notes and respond to them; let us  continue with the _Minuetto_.\"    Thus they finished the suite, Mr. Gaskell demanding a repetition of the  _Gagliarda_, with the air of which he was much pleased. As the clocks  had already struck eleven, they determined not to play more that night;  and Mr. Gaskell rose, blew out the sconces, shut the piano, and put the  music aside. My brother has often assured me that he was quite prepared  for what followed, and had been almost expecting it; for as the books  were put away, a creaking of the wicker chair was audible, exactly  similar to that which he had heard when he stopped playing on the  previous night. There was a moment's silence; the young men looked  involuntarily at one another, and then Mr. Gaskell said, \"I cannot  understand the creaking of that chair; it has never done so before, with  all the music we have played. I am perhaps imaginative and excited with  the fine airs we have heard to-night, but I have an impression that I  cannot dispel that something has been sitting listening to us all this  time, and that now when the concert is ended it has got up and gone.\"  There was a spirit of raillery in his words, but his tone was not so  light as it would ordinarily have been, and he was evidently ill at  ease.    \"Let us try the _Gagliarda_ again,\" said my brother; \"it is the  vibration of the opening notes which affects the wicker-work, and we  shall see if the noise is repeated.\" But Mr. Gaskell excused himself  from trying the experiment, and after some desultory conversation, to  which it was evident that neither was giving any serious attention, he  took his leave and returned to New College.          CHAPTER II      I shall not weary you, my dear Edward, by recounting similar experiences  which occurred on nearly every occasion that the young men met in the  evenings for music. The repetition of the phenomenon had accustomed them  to expect it. Both professed to be quite satisfied that it was to be  attributed to acoustical affinities of vibration between the wicker-work  and certain of the piano wires, and indeed this seemed the only  explanation possible. But, at the same time, the resemblance of the  noises to those caused by a person sitting down in or rising from a  chair was so marked, that even their frequent recurrence never failed to  make a strange impression on them. They felt a reluctance to mention the  matter to their friends, partly from a fear of being themselves laughed  at, and partly to spare from ridicule a circumstance to which each  perhaps, in spite of himself, attached some degree of importance.  Experience soon convinced them that the first noise as of one sitting  down never occurred unless the _Gagliarda_ of the \"Areopagita\" was  played, and that this noise being once heard, the second only followed  it when they ceased playing for the evening. They met every night,  sitting later with the lengthening summer evenings, and every night,  as by some tacit understanding, played the \"Areopagita\" suite before  parting. At the opening bars of the _Gagliarda_ the creaking of the  chair occurred spontaneously with the utmost regularity. They seldom  spoke even to one another of the subject; but one night, when John was  putting away his violin after a long evening's music without having  played the \"Areopagita,\" Mr. Gaskell, who had risen from the pianoforte,  sat down again as by a sudden impulse and said--    \"Johnnie, do not put away your violin yet. It is near twelve o'clock  and I shall get shut out, but I cannot stop to-night without playing the  _Gagliarda_. Suppose that all our theories of vibration and affinity are  wrong, suppose that there really comes here night by night some strange  visitant to hear us, some poor creature whose heart is bound up in that  tune; would it not be unkind to send him away without the hearing of  that piece which he seems most to relish? Let us not be ill-mannered,  but humour his whim; let us play the _Gagliarda_.\"    They played it with more vigour and precision than usual, and the now  customary sound of one taking his seat at once ensued. It was that night  that my brother, looking steadfastly at the chair, saw, or thought he  saw, there some slight obscuration, some penumbra, mist, or subtle  vapour which, as he gazed, seemed to struggle to take human form. He  ceased playing for a moment and rubbed his eyes, but as he did so all  dimness vanished and he saw the chair perfectly empty. The pianist  stopped also at the cessation of the violin, and asked what ailed him.    \"It is only that my eyes were dim,\" he answered.    \"We have had enough for to-night,\" said Mr. Gaskell; \"let us stop.  I shall be locked out.\" He shut the piano, and as he did so the clock  in New College tower struck twelve. He left the room running, but was  late enough at his college door to be reported, admonished with a fine  against such late hours, and confined for a week to college; for being  out after midnight was considered, at that time at least, a somewhat  serious offence.    Thus for some days the musical practice was compulsorily intermitted,"]]]
