[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14015"],[0,"The Discovery of Witches (#2)"],[1,"is a yeare and a halfe since, neither were any kept  from sleep by any order or direction since; but peradventure their own  stubborne wills did not let them sleep, though tendered and offered to  them.          Quer. 9.        _Beside that unreasonable watching, they were extraordinarily      walked, till their feet were blistered, and so forced through      that cruelty to confesse, &c._      Ans.    It was in the same beginning of this discovery, and the meaning of  walking of them at the highest extent of cruelty, was only they to  walke about themselves the night they were watched, only to keepe them  waking: and the reason was this, when they did lye or sit in a chaire,  if they did offer to couch downe, then the watchers were only to  desire them to sit up and walke about, for indeed when they be  suffered so to couch, immediately comes their Familiars into the room  and scareth the watchers, and heartneth on the Witch, though contrary  to the true meaning of the same instructions, diverse have been by  rusticall People, (they hearing them confess to be Witches) mis-used,  spoiled, and abused, diverse whereof have suffered for the same, but  could never be proved against this Discoverer to have a hand in it, or  consent to it; and hath likewise been un-used by him and others, ever  since the time they were kept from sleepe.        Quer. 10.        _But there hath been an abominable, inhumane, and unmercifull      tryall of these poore creatures, by tying them, and heaving them      into the water; a tryall not allowable by Law or conscience, and      I would faine know the reasons for that._      Ans.    It is not denyed but many were so served as had Papps, and floated,  others that had none were tryed with them and sunk, but marke the  reasons.    For first the Divels policie is great, in perswading many to come of  their own accord to be tryed, perswading them their marks are so close  they shall not be found out, so as diverse have come 10. or 12. Miles  to be searched of their own accord, and hanged for their labour, (as  one _Meggs_ a Baker did, who lived within 7. Miles of _Norwich_, and  was hanged at _Norwich_ Assizes for witchcraft) then when they find  that the Devil tells them false they reflect on him, and he (as 40.  have confessed) adviseth them to be sworne, and tels them they shall  sinke and be cleared that way, then when they be tryed that way and  floate, they see the Devill deceives them againe, and have so laid  open his treacheries.    2. It was never brought in against any of them at their tryals as any  evidence.    3. King _James_ in his _Demonology_ saith, it is a certaine rule, for  (saith he) Witches deny their baptisme when they Covenant with the  Devill, water being the sole element thereof, and therefore saith he,  when they be heaved into the water, the water refuseth to receive them  into her bosome, (they being such Miscreants to deny their baptisme)  and suffers them to float, as the Froath on the Sea, which the water  will not recieve, but casts it up and downe till it comes to the  earthy element the shore, and there leaves it to consume.    4. Observe these generation of Witches, if they be at any time abused  by being called Whore, Theefe, &c, by any where they live, they are  the readiest to cry and wring their hands, and shed tears in abundance  & run with full and right sorrowfull acclamations to some Justice of  the Peace, and with many teares make their complaints: but now behold  their stupidity; nature or the elements reflection from them, when  they are accused for this horrible and damnable sin of Witchcraft,  they never alter or change their countenances nor let one Teare fall.  This by the way, swimming (by able Divines whom I reverence) is  condemned for no way, and therefore of late hath, and for ever shall  be left.        Quer. 11.        _Oh! but if this torturing Witch-catcher can by all or any of      these meanes wring out a word or two of confession from any of      these stupified, ignorant, unitelligible, poore silly creatures,      (though none heare it but himselfe) he will adde and put her in      feare to confesse telling her, else she shall be hanged; but if      she doe, he will set her at liberty, and so put a word into her      mouth, and make such a silly creature confesse she knowes not      what._      Answ.    He is of a better conscience, and for your better understanding of  him, he doth thus uncase himselfe to all, add declares what  confessions (though made by a Witch against her selfe) he allowes not  of, and doth altogether account of no validity, or worthy of credence  to be given to it, and ever did so account it, and ever likewise  shall.    1. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch to be of any validity,  when it is drawn from her by any torture or violence whatsoever;  although after watching, walking, or swimming, diverse have suffered,  yet peradventure Magistrates with much care and diligence did solely  and fully examine them after sleepe, and consideration sufficient.    2. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch, which is drawn from  her by flattery, viz. _if you will confess you shall go home, you  shall not go to the Goale, nor be hanged, &c._    3. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch, when she confesseth  any improbability, impossibility, as _flying in the ayre, riding on a  broom, &c._    4. He utterly denyes a confession of a Witch, when it is interrogated  to her, and words put into her mouth, to be of any force or effect: as  to say to a silly (yet Witch wicked enough) _you have foure Imps have  you not_? She answers affirmatively, Yes: _did they not suck you_?  Yes, saith she: _Are not their names so, and so_? Yes, saith shee;  _Did not you send such an Impe to kill my child_? Yes saith she, this  being all her confession after this manner, it is by him accompted  nothing, and he earnestly doth desire that all Magistrates and Jurors  would a little more then ever they did examine witnesses about the  interrogated confessions.        Quer. 12.        _If all those confessions be denyed, I wonder what he will make      confession, for sure it is, all these wayes have been used and      took for good confessions, and many have suffered for them, and      I know not what, he will then make confession._      Answ.    Yes, in brief he will declare what confession of a Witch is of  validity and force in his judgement, to hang a Witch: when a Witch is  first found with teats, then sequestred from her house, which is onely  to keep her old associates from her, and so by good counsell brought  into a sad condition, by understanding of the horribleness of her sin,  and the judgements threatned against her; and knowing the Devils  malice and subtile circumventions, is brought to remorse and sorrow  for complying with Satan so long, and disobeying Gods sacred Commands,  doth then desire to unfold her mind with much bitterness, and then  without any of the before-mentioned hard usages or questions put to  her, doth of her owne accord declare what was the occasion of the  Devils appearing to her, whether ignorance, pride, anger, malice, &c.  was predominant over her, she doth then declare what speech they had,  what likeness he was in, what voice be had, what familiars he sent  her, what number of spirits, what names they had, what shape they were  in, what imployment she set them about to severall persons in severall  places, (unknowne to the hearers) all which mischiefes being proved to  be done, at the same time she confessed to the same parties for the  same cause, and all effected, is testimony enough again her for all  her denyall.        Quest. 13.        _How can any possibly beleeve that the Devill and the Witch      joyning together, should have such power, as the Witches      confesse to kill such such a man, child, horse, cow, the like;      if we beleeve they can doe what they will, then we derogate from      Gods power, who for certaine limits the Devill and the Witch;      and I cannot beleeve they have any power at all._      Answ.    God suffers the Devill many times to doe much hurt, and the devill  doth play many times the deluder and impostor with these Witches, in  perswading them that they are the cause of such and such a murder  wrought by him with their consents, when and indeed neither he nor  they had any hand in it, as thus: We must needs argue, he is of a  long standing, above 6000. yeers, then he must needs be the best  Scholar in all knowledges of arts and tongues, & so have the best  skill in _Physicke_, judgment in _Physiognomie_, and knowledge of what  disease is reigning or predominant in this or that mans body, (and so  for cattell too) by reason of his long experience. This subtile  tempter knowing such a man lyable to some sudden disease, (as by  experience I have found) as _Plurisie_, _Imposthume_, &c. he resorts  to divers Witches; if they know the man, and seek to make a difference  between the Witches and the party, it may be by telling them he hath  threatned to have them very shortly searched, and so hanged for  Witches, then they all consult with _Satan_ to save themselves, and  _Satan_ stands ready prepared, with a _What will you have me doe for  you, my deare and nearest children, covenanted and compacted with me  in my hellish league, and sealed with your blood, my delicate  firebrand-darlings_.    [Sidenote: _The Divells speech to the Witches._]    Oh thou (say they) that at the first didst promise to save us thy  servants from any of out deadly enemies discovery, and didst promise  to avenge and flay all those, we pleased, that did offend us; Murther  that wretch suddenly who threatens the down-fall of your loyall  subjects. He then promiseth to effect it. Next newes is heard the  partie is dead, he comes to the witch, and gets a world of reverence,  credence and respect for his power and activeness, when and indeed the  disease kills the party,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#2)"],[1," Many a one, in honor of Juno, celebrates Argos,  productive of steeds, and rich Mycenae. Neither patient Lacedaemon so  much struck me, nor so much did the plain of fertile Larissa, as the  house of resounding Albunea, and the precipitately rapid Anio, and the  Tiburnian groves, and the orchards watered by ductile rivulets. As the  clear south wind often clears away the clouds from a lowering sky, now  teems with perpetual showers; so do you, O Plancus, wisely remember to  put an end to grief and the toils of life by mellow wine; whether the  camp, refulgent with banners, possess you, or the dense shade of your  own Tibur shall detain you. When Teucer fled from Salamis and his  father, he is reported, notwithstanding, to have bound his temples,  bathed in wine, with a poplar crown, thus accosting his anxious friends:  \"O associates and companions, we will go wherever fortune, more  propitious than a father, shall carry us. Nothing is to be despaired of  under Teucer's conduct, and the auspices of Teucer: for the infallible  Apollo has promised, that a Salamis in a new land shall render the name  equivocal. O gallant heroes, and often my fellow-sufferers in greater  hardships than these, now drive away your cares with wine: to-morrow we  will re-visit the vast ocean.\"           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VIII.    TO LYDIA.      Lydia, I conjure thee by all the powers above, to tell me why you are so  intent to ruin Sybaris by inspiring him with love? Why hates he the  sunny plain, though inured to bear the dust and heat? Why does he  neither, in military accouterments, appear mounted among his equals; nor  manage the Gallic steed with bitted reins? Why fears he to touch the  yellow Tiber? Why shuns he the oil of the ring more cautiously than  viper's blood? Why neither does he, who has often acquired reputation by  the quoit, often by the javelin having cleared the mark, any longer  appear with arms all black-and-blue by martial exercises? Why is he  concealed, as they say the son of the sea-goddess Thetis was, just  before the mournful funerals of Troy; lest a manly habit should hurry  him to slaughter, and the Lycian troops?           *       *       *       *       *        ODE IX.    TO THALIARCHUS.      You see how Soracte stands white with deep snow, nor can the laboring  woods any longer support the weight, and the rivers stagnate with the  sharpness of the frost. Dissolve the cold, liberally piling up billets  on the hearth; and bring out, O Thaliarchus, the more generous wine,  four years old, from the Sabine jar. Leave the rest to the gods, who  having once laid the winds warring with the fervid ocean, neither the  cypresses nor the aged ashes are moved. Avoid inquiring what may happen  tomorrow; and whatever day fortune shall bestow on you, score it up for  gain; nor disdain, being a young fellow, pleasant loves, nor dances, as  long as ill-natured hoariness keeps off from your blooming age. Now let  both the Campus Martius and the public walks, and soft whispers at the  approach of evening be repeated at the appointed hour: now, too, the  delightful laugh, the betrayer of the lurking damsel from some secret  corner, and the token ravished from her arms or fingers, pretendingly  tenacious of it.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE X.    TO MERCURY.      Mercury, eloquent grandson of Atlas, thou who artful didst from the  savage manners of the early race of men by oratory, and the institution  of the graceful Palaestra: I will celebrate thee, messenger of Jupiter  and the other gods, and parent of the curved lyre; ingenious to conceal  whatever thou hast a mind to, in jocose theft. While Apollo, with angry  voice, threatened you, then but a boy, unless you would restore the  oxen, previously driven away by your fraud, he laughed, [when he found  himself] deprived of his quiver [also]. Moreover, the wealthy Priam too,  on his departure from Ilium, under your guidance deceived the proud sons  of Atreus, and the Thessalian watch-lights, and the camp inveterate  agaist Troy. You settle the souls of good men in blissful regions, and  drive together the airy crowd with your golden rod, acceptable both to  the supernal and infernal gods.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XI.    TO LEUCONOE.      Inquire not, Leuconoe (it is not fitting you should know), how long a  term of life the gods have granted to you or to me: neither consult the  Chaldean calculations. How much better is it to bear with patience  whatever shall happen! Whether Jupiter have granted us more winters, or  [this as] the last, which now breaks the Etrurian waves against the  opposing rocks. Be wise; rack off your wines, and abridge your hopes [in  proportion] to the shortness of your life. While we are conversing,  envious age has been flying; seize the present day, not giving the least  credit to the succeeding one.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XII.    TO AUGUSTUS.      What man, what hero, O Clio, do you undertake to celebrate on the harp,  or the shrill pipe? What god? Whose name shall the sportive echo  resound, either in the shady borders of Helicon, or on the top of  Pindus, or on cold Haemus? Whence the woods followed promiscuously the  tuneful Orpheus, who by his maternal art retarded the rapid courses of  rivers, and the fleet winds; and was so sweetly persuasive, that he drew  along the listening oaks with his harmonious strings. But what can I  sing prior to the usual praises of the Sire, who governs the affairs of  men and gods; who [governs] the sea, the earth, and the whole world with  the vicissitudes of seasons? Whence nothing is produced greater than  him; nothing springs either like him, or even in a second degree to him:  nevertheless, Pallas has acquired these honors, which are next after  him.    Neither will I pass thee by in silence, O Bacchus, bold in combat; nor  thee, O Virgin, who art an enemy to the savage beasts; nor thee, O  Phoebus, formidable for thy unerring dart.    I will sing also of Hercules, and the sons of Leda, the one illustrious  for his achievements on horseback, the other on foot; whose  clear-shining constellation as soon as it has shone forth to the  sailors, the troubled surge falls down from the rocks, the winds cease,  the clouds vanish, and the threatening waves subside in the sea--because  it was their will. After these, I am in doubt whom I shall first  commemorate, whether Romulus, or the peaceful reign of Numa, or the  splendid ensigns of Tarquinius, or the glorious death of Cato. I will  celebrate, out of gratitude, with the choicest verses, Regulus, and the  Scauri, and Paulus, prodigal of his mighty soul, when Carthage  conquered, and Fabricius.    Severe poverty, and an hereditary farm, with a dwelling suited to it,  formed this hero useful in war; as it did also Curius with his rough  locks, and Camillus. The fame of Marcellus increases, as a tree does in  the insensible progress of time. But the Julian constellation shines  amid them all, as the moon among the smaller stars. O thou son of  Saturn, author and preserver of the human race, the protection of Caesar  is committed to thy charge by the Fates: thou shalt reign supreme, with  Caesar for thy second. Whether he shall subdue with a just victory the  Parthians making inroads upon Italy, or shall render subject the Seres  and Indians on the Eastern coasts; he shall rule the wide world with  equity, in subordination to thee. Thou shalt shake Olympus with thy  tremendous car; thou shalt hurl thy hostile thunderbolts against the  polluted groves.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIII.    TO LYDIA.      O Lydia, when you commend Telephus' rosy neck, and the waxen arms of  Telephus, alas! my inflamed liver swells with bile difficult to be  repressed. Then neither is my mind firm, nor does my color maintain a  certain situation: and the involuntary tears glide down my cheek,  proving with what lingering flames I am inwardly consumed. I am on fire,  whether quarrels rendered immoderate by wine have stained your fair  shoulders; or whether the youth, in his fury, has impressed with his  teeth a memorial on your lips. If you will give due attention to my  advice, never expect that he will be constant, who inhumanly wounds  those sweet kisses, which Venus has imbued with the fifth part of all  her nectar. O thrice and more than thrice happy those, whom an  indissoluble connection binds together; and whose love, undivided by  impious complainings, does not separate them sooner than the last day!           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIV.    TO THE ROMAN STATE.      O ship, new waves will bear you back again to sea. O what are you doing?  Bravely seize the port. Do you not perceive, that your sides are  destitute of oars, and your mast wounded by the violent south wind, and  your main-yards groan, and your keel can scarcely support the  impetuosity of the waves without the help of cordage? You have not  entire sails; nor gods, whom you may again invoke, pressed with  distress: notwithstanding you are made of the pines of Pontus, and as  the daughter of an illustrious wood, boast your race, and a fame now of  no service to you. The timorous sailor has no dependence on a painted  stern. Look to yourself, unless you are destined to be the sport of the  winds. O thou, so lately my trouble and fatigue, but now an object of  tenderness and solicitude, mayest thou escape those dangerous seas which  flow among the shining Cyclades.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XV.    TO PARIS.      When the perfidious shepherd (Paris) carried off by sea in Trojan ships  his hostess Helen, Nereus suppressed the swift winds in an unpleasant  calm, that he might sing the dire fates. \"With unlucky omen art thou  conveying home her, whom Greece with a numerous army shall demand back  again, having entered into a"]]]
