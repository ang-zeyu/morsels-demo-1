You shall test it shortly.  We are  going to drive through the heart of England; and as we go I'll tell you  what I was speaking of last night.  Our route is to be by Salisbury,  Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Worcester, Stafford; and so home.\"    Adam remained silent a few minutes, during which he seemed all eyes, for  he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon.    \"Has our journey to-day, sir,\" he asked, \"any special relation to what  you said last night that you wanted to tell me?\"    \"Not directly; but indirectly, everything.\"    \"Won't you tell me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if anything  strikes you as we go along, just run it in.  I shall understand.\"    So old Salton spoke:    \"To begin at the beginning, Adam.  That lecture of yours on 'The Romans  in Britain,' a report of which you posted to me, set me thinking--in  addition to telling me your tastes.  I wrote to you at once and asked you  to come home, for it struck me that if you were fond of historical  research--as seemed a fact--this was exactly the place for you, in  addition to its being the home of your own forbears.  If you could learn  so much of the British Romans so far away in New South Wales, where there  cannot be even a tradition of them, what might you not make of the same  amount of study on the very spot.  Where we are going is in the real  heart of the old kingdom of Mercia, where there are traces of all the  various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became  Britain.\"    \"I rather gathered that you had some more definite--more personal reason  for my hurrying.  After all, history can keep--except in the making!\"    \"Quite right, my boy.  I had a reason such as you very wisely guessed.  I  was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local  history occurred.\"    \"What is that, if I may ask, sir?\"    \"Certainly.  The principal landowner of our part of the county is on his  way home, and there will be a great home-coming, which you may care to  see.  The fact is, for more than a century the various owners in the  succession here, with the exception of a short time, have lived abroad.\"    \"How is that, sir, if I may ask?\"    \"The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra Regis, the  family seat of the Caswall family.  The last owner who lived here was  Edgar Caswall, grandfather of the man who is coming here--and he was the  only one who stayed even a short time.  This man's grandfather, also  named Edgar--they keep the tradition of the family Christian  name--quarrelled with his family and went to live abroad, not keeping up  any intercourse, good or bad, with his relatives, although this  particular Edgar, as I told you, did visit his family estate, yet his son  was born and lived and died abroad, while his grandson, the latest  inheritor, was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirty--his  present age.  This was the second line of absentees.  The great estate of  Castra Regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five  generations--covering more than a hundred and twenty years.  It has been  well administered, however, and no tenant or other connected with it has  had anything of which to complain.  All the same, there has been much  natural anxiety to see the new owner, and we are all excited about the  event of his coming.  Even I am, though I own my own estate, which,  though adjacent, is quite apart from Castra Regis.--Here we are now in  new ground for you.  That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, and when  we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county, and you  will naturally want your eyes.  So we shall shortly have to keep our  minds on old Mercia.  However, you need not be disappointed.  My old  friend, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, who, like myself, is a free-holder near  Castra Regis--his estate, Doom Tower, is over the border of Derbyshire,  on the Peak--is coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome  Edgar Caswall.  He is just the sort of man you will like.  He is devoted  to history, and is President of the Mercian Archaeological Society.  He  knows more of our own part of the country, with its history and its  people, than anyone else.  I expect he will have arrived before us, and  we three can have a long chat after dinner.  He is also our local  geologist and natural historian.  So you and he will have many interests  in common.  Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak  and its caverns, and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times.\"    They spent the night at Cheltenham, and on the following morning resumed  their journey to Stafford.  Adam's eyes were in constant employment, and  it was not till Salton declared that they had now entered on the last  stage of their journey, that he referred to Sir Nathaniel's coming.    As the dusk was closing down, they drove on to Lesser Hill, Mr. Salton's  house.  It was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings.  Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill, not quite so high  as that which was covered by the Castle, on whose tower flew the flag,  and which was all ablaze with moving lights, manifestly used in the  preparations for the festivities on the morrow.  So Adam deferred his  curiosity till daylight.  His grand-uncle was met at the door by a fine  old man, who greeted him warmly.    \"I came over early as you wished.  I suppose this is your grand-nephew--I  am glad to meet you, Mr. Adam Salton.  I am Nathaniel de Salis, and your  uncle is one of my oldest friends.\"    Adam, from the moment of their eyes meeting, felt as if they were already  friends.  The meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already  sounded in his ears.    The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met, made the imparting  of information easy.  Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of the world, who  had travelled much, and within a certain area studied deeply.  He was a  brilliant conversationalist, as was to be expected from a successful  diplomatist, even under unstimulating conditions.  But he had been  touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger man's evident  admiration and willingness to learn from him.  Accordingly the  conversation, which began on the most friendly basis, soon warmed to an  interest above proof, as the old man spoke of it next day to Richard  Salton.  He knew already that his old friend wanted his grand-nephew to  learn all he could of the subject in hand, and so had during his journey  from the Peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation.  Accordingly, Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he  wanted to know.  When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn,  leaving the three men at their wine, Sir Nathaniel began.    \"I gather from your uncle--by the way, I suppose we had better speak of  you as uncle and nephew, instead of going into exact relationship?  In  fact, your uncle is so old and dear a friend, that, with your permission,  I shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as  Adam, as though you were his son.\"    \"I should like,\" answered the young man, \"nothing better!\"    The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men, but, with the usual  avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves,  they instinctively returned to the previous question.  Sir Nathaniel took  the lead.    \"I understand, Adam, that your uncle has posted you regarding the  relationships of the Caswall family?\"    \"Partly, sir; but I understood that I was to hear minuter details from  you--if you would be so good.\"    \"I shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge goes.  Well, the first Caswall in our immediate record is an Edgar, head of the  family and owner of the estate, who came into his kingdom just about the  time that George III. did.  He had one son of about twenty-four.  There  was a violent quarrel between the two.  No one of this generation has any  idea of the cause; but, considering the family characteristics, we may  take it for granted that though it was deep and violent, it was on the  surface trivial.    \"The result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a  reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was going.  He  never came back again.  A few years after, he died, without having in the  meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his father.  He married abroad  and left one son, who seems to have been brought up in ignorance of all  belonging to him.  The gulf between them appears to have been  unbridgable; for in time this son married and in turn had a son, but  neither joy nor sorrow brought the sundered together.  Under such  conditions no _rapprochement_ was to be looked for, and an utter  indifference, founded at best on ignorance, took the place of family  affection--even on community of interests.  It was only due to the  watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of this new heir was ever made  known.  He actually spent a few months in the ancestral home.    \"After this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the estate.  As no other children have been born to any of the newer generations in  the intervening years, all hopes of heritage are now centred in the  grandson of this man.    \"Now, it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing  characteristics of this race.  These were well preserved and unchanging;  one and all they are the same: cold, selfish, dominant, reckless of  consequences in pursuit of their own will.  It was not that they did not  keep faith, though that was a matter which gave them little concern, but  that they took care to think beforehand of what they should do in order  to gain their own ends.  If they should make a mistake, someone else  should bear the burthen of it.  This was so perpetually recurrent that it  seemed to be a part of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#2)"],[1,"knowledge of bucking, she could only shake her head and send  a ringing whinny of appeal up the slope of the mountain, toward the  approaching rider.    In spite of the approaching danger, in spite of this delay which was  ruining his chances of getting to Stillwater before the train, Bill  Gregg watched in marvel and delight the horsemanship of the stranger.  Ronicky Doone, if this were he, was certainly the prince of all wild  riders.    Even as the mare stopped in answer to the signal of her owner, Ronicky  Doone sent his mount over the edge of a veritable cliff, flung him  back on his haunches and slid down the gravelly slope, careening  from side to side. With a rush of pebbles about him and a dust cloud  whirling after, Ronicky Doone broke out into the road ahead of the  mare, and she whinnied softly again to greet him.    Bill Gregg found himself looking not into the savage face of such  a gunfighter as he had been led to expect, but a handsome fellow,  several years younger than he, a high-headed, straight-eyed, buoyant  type. In his seat in the saddle, in the poise of his head and the play  of his hand on the reins Bill Gregg recognized a boundless nervous  force. There was nothing ponderous about Ronicky Doone. Indeed he was  not more than middle size, but, as he reined his horse in the middle  of the road and looked with flashing eyes at Bill Gregg, he appeared  very large indeed.    Gregg was used to fighting or paying his way, or doing both at the  same time, as occasion offered. He decided that this was certainly an  occasion for much money and few words.    \"You're Doone, I guess,\" he said, \"and you know that I've played a  pretty bad trick on you, taking your hoss this way. But I wanted to  pay for it, Doone, and I'll pay now. I've got to get to Stillwater  before that train. Look at her! I haven't hurt her any. Her wind isn't  touched. She's pretty wet, but sweat never hurt nothing on four feet,  eh?\"    \"I dunno,\" returned Ronicky Doone. \"I'd as soon run off with a man's  wife as his hoss.\"    \"Partner,\" said Bill Gregg desperately, \"I have to get there!\"    \"Then get there on your own feet, not the feet of another gent's  hoss.\"    Gregg controlled his rising anger. Beyond him the train was looming  larger and larger in the plain, and Stillwater seemed more and more  distant. He writhed in the saddle.    \"I tell you I'll pay--I'll pay the whole value of the hoss, if you  want.\"    He was about to say more when he saw the eyes of Ronicky Doone widen  and fix.    \"Look,\" said the other suddenly, \"you've been cutting her up with the  spurs!\"    Gregg glanced down to the flank of the bay to discover that he had  used the spurs more recklessly than he thought. A sharp rowel had  picked through the skin, and, though it was probably only a slight  wound indeed, it had brought a smear of red to the surface.    Ronicky Doone trembled with anger.    \"Confound you!\" he said furiously. \"Any fool would have known that you  didn't need a spur on that hoss! What part d'you come from where they  teach you to kill a hoss when you ride it? Can you tell me that?\"    \"I'll tell you after I get to Stillwater.\"    \"I'll see you hung before I see you in Stillwater.\"    \"You've talked too much, Doone,\" Gregg said huskily.    \"I've just begun,\" said Doone.    \"Then take this and shut up,\" exclaimed Bill Gregg.    Ordinarily he was the straightest and the squarest man in the world in  a fight. But a sudden anger had flared up in him. He had an impulse to  kill; to get rid of this obstacle between him and everything he wanted  most in life. Without more warning than that he snatched out his  revolver and fired point blank at Ronicky Doone. Certainly all the  approaches to a fight had been made, and Doone might have been  expecting the attack. At any rate, as the gun shot out of Gregg's  holster, the other swung himself sidewise in his own saddle and,  snapping out his revolver, fired from the hip.    That swerve to the side saved him, doubtless, from the shot of Gregg;  his own bullet plowed cleanly through the thigh of the other rider.  The whole leg of Gregg went numb, and he found himself slumping  helplessly to one side. He dropped his gun, and he had to cling with  both hands to lower himself out of the saddle. Now he sat in the dust  of the trail and stared stupidly, not at his conqueror, but at the  train that was flashing into the little town of Stillwater, just below  them.    He hardly heeded Ronicky Doone, as the latter started forward with an  oath, knelt beside him and examined the wound. \"It's clean,\" Doone  said, as he started ripping up his undershirt to make bandages. \"I'll  have you fixed so you can be gotten into Stillwater.\"    He began to work rapidly, twisting the clothes around Gregg's thigh,  which he had first laid bare by some dexterous use of a hunting knife.    Then Gregg turned his eyes to those of Doone. The train had pulled out  of Stillwater. The sound of the coughing of the engine, as it started  up, came faintly to them after a moment.    \"Of all the darned fools!\" said the two men in one voice.    And then they grinned at each other. Certainly it was not the first  fight or the first wound for either of them.    \"I'm sorry,\" they began again, speaking together in chorus.    \"Matter of fact,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"that bay means a pile to me.  When I seen the red on her side--\"    \"Can't be more than a chance prick.\"    \"I know,\" said Ronicky, \"but I didn't stop to think.\"    \"And I should of give you fair warning before I went for the gat.\"    \"Look here,\" said Ronicky, \"you talk like a straight sort of a gent to  me.\"    \"And you thought I was a cross between a hoss thief and a gunfighter?\"    \"I dunno what I thought, except that I wanted the mare back. Stranger,  I'm no end sorry this has happened. Maybe you'd lemme know why you was  in such a hurry to get to Stillwater. If they's any trouble coming  down the road behind you, maybe I can help take care of it for you.\"  And he smiled coldly and significantly at Bill Gregg.    The latter eyed with some wonder the man who had just shot him down  and was now offering to fight for his safety. \"Nothing like that,\"  said Bill. \"I was going to Stillwater to meet a girl.\"    \"As much of a rush as all that to see a girl?\"    \"On that train.\"    Ronicky Doone whistled softly. \"And I messed it up! But why didn't you  tell me what you wanted?\"    \"I didn't have a chance. Besides I could not waste time in talking and  explaining to everybody along the road.\"    \"Sure you couldn't, but the girl'll forgive you when she finds out  what happened.\"    \"No, she won't, because she'll never find out.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"I don't know where she is.\"    \"Riding all that way just to see a girl--\"    \"It's a long story, partner, and this leg is beginning to act up. Tell  you the best thing would be for you to jump on your mare and jog into  Stillwater for a buckboard and then come back and get me. What d'you  say?\"    Twenty minutes after Ronicky Doone had swung into the saddle and raced  down the road, the buckboard arrived and the wounded man was helped on  to a pile of blankets in the body of the wagon.    The shooting, of course, was explained by the inevitable gun accident.  Ronicky Doone happened to be passing along that way and saw Bill Gregg  looking over his revolver as he rode along. At that moment the gun  exploded and--    The two men who had come out in the buckboard listened to the tale  with expressionless faces. As a matter of fact they had already heard  in Stillwater that no less a person than Ronicky Doone was on his way  toward that village in pursuit of a man who had ridden off on the  famous bay mare, Lou. But they accepted Ronicky's bland version of the  accident with perfect calm and with many expressions of sympathy. They  would have other things to say after they had deposited the wounded  man in Stillwater.    The trip in was a painful one for Bill Gregg. For one thing the  exhaustion of the long three days' trip was now causing a wave of  weariness to sweep over him. The numbness, which had come through the  leg immediately after the shooting, was now replaced by a steady and  continued aching. And more than all he was unnerved by the sense of  utter failure, utter loss. Never in his life had he fought so bitterly  and steadily for a thing, and yet he had lost at the very verge of  success.          Chapter Three      _At Stillwater_    The true story was, of course, known almost at once, but, since  Ronicky Doone swore that he would tackle the first man who accused him  of having shot down Bill Gregg, the talk was confined to whispers. In  the meantime Stillwater rejoiced in its possession of Ronicky Doone.  Beyond one limited section of the mountain desert he was not as  yet known, but he had one of those personalities which are called  electric. Whatever he did seemed greater because he, Ronicky Doone,  had done it.    Not that he had done a great many things as yet. But there was a  peculiar feeling in the air that Ronicky Doone was capable of great  and strange performances. Men older than he were willing to accept him  as their leader; men younger than he idolized him.    Ronicky Doone, then, the admired of all beholders, is leaning in the  doorway of Stillwater's second and best hotel. His bandanna today is  a terrific yellow, set off with crimson half-moon and stars strewn  liberally on it. His shirt is merely white, but it is given some  significance by having nearly half of a red silk handkerchief falling  out of the breast pocket. His sombrero is one of those works of art  which Mexican families pass from father to son, only his was new and  had not yet received that limp effect of age. And, like the gaudiest  Mexican head piece, the band of this sombrero was of purest gold,  beaten into the forms of various saints. Ronicky Doone knew nothing at  all about saints, but he approved very much of the animation of the"]]]
