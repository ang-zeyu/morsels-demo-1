In India and Japan, in Russia  and Roumania, among the Indians at the foot of the Rocky Mountains,  these stories are still told, not only to children by their mothers and  grandmothers, but to crowds of grown-up people by those who have the art  of making tales entertaining; and there are still so many of these  stories floating about the world from one person to another that if they  were written down they would fill a great library. \"Until the generation  now lately passed away,\" says Mr. Gosse in his introduction to that very  interesting book, \"Folk and Fairy Tales\" by Asbjoernsen, \"almost the only  mode in which the Norwegian peasant killed time in the leisure moments  between his daily labour and his religious observances, was in listening  to stories. It was the business of old men and women who had reached the  extreme limit of their working hours, to retain and repeat these ancient  legends in prose and verse, and to recite or sing them when called to do  so.\" And Miss Hapgood has told us that in Russia these stories have not  only been handed down wholly by word or mouth for a thousand years, but  are flourishing to-day and extending into fresh fields.    The stories made by the people, and told before evening fires, or in  public places and at the gates of inns in the Orient, belong to the ages  when books were few and knowledge limited, or to people whose fancy was  not hampered by familiarity with or care for facts; they are the  creations, as they were the amusement, of men and women who were  children in knowledge, but were thinking deeply and often wisely of what  life meant to them, and were eager to know and hear more about  themselves, their fellows, and the world. In the earlier folk-stories  one finds a childlike simplicity and readiness to believe in the  marvellous; and these qualities are found also in the French peasant's  version of the career of Napoleon.    HAMILTON W. MABIE          FOLK TALES EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW          I    HANS IN LUCK      Hans had served his Master seven years, and at the end of that time he  said to him: \"Master, since my time is up, I should like to go home to  my mother; so give me my wages, if you please.\"    His Master replied, \"You have served me truly and honestly, Hans, and  such as your service was, such shall be your reward;\" and with these  words he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head. Hans thereupon took  his handkerchief out of his pocket, and, wrapping the gold up in it,  threw it over his shoulder and set out on the road toward his native  village. As he went along, carefully setting one foot to the ground  before the other, a horseman came in sight, trotting gaily and briskly  along upon a capital animal. \"Ah,\" said Hans, aloud, \"what a fine thing  that riding is! one is seated, as it were, upon a stool, kicks against  no stones, spares one's shoes, and gets along without any trouble!\"    The Rider, overhearing Hans making these reflections, stopped and said,  \"Why, then, do you travel on foot, my fine fellow?\"    \"Because I am forced,\" replied Hans, \"for I have got a bit of a lump to  carry home; it certainly is gold, but then I can't carry my head  straight, and it hurts my shoulder.\"    \"If you like we will exchange,\" said the Rider. \"I will give you my  horse, and you can give me your lump of gold.\"    \"With all my heart,\" cried Hans; \"but I tell you fairly you undertake a  very heavy burden.\"    The man dismounted, took the gold, and helped Hans on to the horse, and,  giving him the reins into his hands, said, \"Now, when you want to go  faster, you must chuckle with your tongue and cry, 'Gee up! gee up!'\"    Hans was delighted indeed when he found himself on the top of a horse,  and riding along so freely and gaily. After a while he thought he should  like to go rather quicker, and so he cried, \"Gee up! gee up!\" as the man  had told him. The horse soon set off at a hard trot, and, before Hans  knew what he was about, he was thrown over head and heels into a ditch  which divided the fields from the road. The horse, having accomplished  this feat, would have bolted off if he had not been stopped by a Peasant  who was coming that way, driving a cow before him. Hans soon picked  himself up on his legs, but he was terribly put out, and said to the  countryman, \"That is bad sport, that riding, especially when one mounts  such a beast as that, which stumbles and throws one off so as to nearly  break one's neck. I will never ride on that animal again. Commend me to  your cow: one may walk behind her without any discomfort, and besides  one has, every day for certain, milk, butter, and cheese. Ah! what would  I not give for such a cow!\"    \"Well,\" said the Peasant, \"such an advantage you may soon enjoy; I will  exchange my cow for your horse.\"    To this Hans consented with a thousand thanks, and the Peasant, swinging  himself upon the horse, rode off in a hurry.    Hans now drove his cow off steadily before him, thinking of his lucky  bargain in this wise: \"I have a bit of bread, and I can, as often as I  please, eat with it butter and cheese, and when I am thirsty I can milk  my cow and have a draught: and what more can I desire?\"    As soon, then, as he came to an inn he halted, and ate with great  satisfaction all the bread he had brought with him for his noonday and  evening meals, and washed it down with a glass of beer, to buy which he  spent his two last farthings. This over, he drove his cow farther, but  still in the direction of his mother's village. The heat meantime became  more and more oppressive as noontime approached, and just then Hans came  to a common which was an hour's journey across. Here he got into such a  state of heat that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, and he  thought to himself: \"This won't do; I will just milk my cow, and refresh  myself.\" Hans, therefore tied her to a stump of a tree, and, having no  pail, placed his leathern cap below, and set to work, but not a drop of  milk could he squeeze out. He had placed himself, too, very awkwardly,  and at last the impatient cow gave him such a kick on the head that he  tumbled over on the ground, and for a long time knew not where he was.  Fortunately, not many hours after, a Butcher passed by, trundling a  young pig along upon a wheelbarrow. \"What trick is this!\" exclaimed he,  helping up poor Hans; and Hans told him that all that had passed. The  Butcher then handed him his flask and said, \"There, take a drink; it  will revive you. Your cow might well give no milk: she is an old beast,  and worth nothing at the best but for the plough or the butcher!\"    \"Eh! eh!\" said Hans, pulling his hair over his eyes, \"who would have  thought it? It is all very well when one can kill a beast like that at  home, and make a profit of the flesh; but for my part I have no relish  for cow's flesh; it is too tough for me! Ah! a young pig like yours is  the thing that tastes something like, let alone the sausages!\"    \"Well now, for love of you,\" said the Butcher, \"I will make an exchange,  and let you have my pig for your cow.\"    \"Heaven reward you for your kindness!\" cried Hans; and, giving up the  cow, he untied the pig from the barrow and took into his hands the  string with which it was tied.    Hans walked on again, considering how everything had happened just as he  wished, and how all his vexations had turned out for the best after all!  Presently a boy overtook him carrying a fine white goose under his arm,  and after they had said \"Good-day\" to each other, Hans began to talk  about his luck, and what profitable exchanges he had made. The Boy on  his part told him that he was carrying the goose to a christening-feast.  \"Just lift it,\" said he to Hans, holding it up by its wings, \"just feel  how heavy it is; why, it has been fattened up for the last eight weeks,  and whoever bites it when it is cooked will have to wipe the grease from  each side of his mouth!\"    \"Yes,\" said Hans, weighing it with one hand, \"it is weighty, but my pig  is no trifle either.\"    While he was speaking the Boy kept looking about on all sides, and  shaking his head suspiciously, and at length he broke out, \"I am afraid  it is not all right about your pig. In the village through which I have  just come, one has been stolen out of the sty of the mayor himself; and  I am afraid, very much afraid, you have it now in your hand! They have  sent out several people, and it would be a very bad job for you if they  found you with the pig; the best thing you can do is to hide it in some  dark corner!\"    Honest Hans was thunderstruck, and exclaimed, \"Ah, Heaven help me in  this fresh trouble! you know the neighbourhood better than I do; do you  take my pig and let me have your goose,\" said he to the boy.    \"I shall have to hazard something at that game,\" replied the Boy, \"but  still I do not wish to be the cause of your meeting with misfortune;\"  and, so saying, he took the rope into his own hand, and drove the pig  off quickly by a side-path, while Hans, lightened of his cares, walked  on homeward with the goose under his arm. \"If I judge rightly,\" thought  he to himself, \"I have gained even by this exchange: first there is a  good roast; then the quantity of fat which will drip out will make goose  broth for a quarter of a year; and then there are fine white feathers,  which, when once I have put into my pillow I warrant I shall sleep  without rocking. What pleasure my mother will have!\"    As he came to the last village on his road there stood a Knife-grinder,  with his barrow by the hedge, whirling his wheel round and singing:        \"Scissors and razors and such-like I grind;       And gaily my rags are flying behind.\"      Hans stopped and looked at him, and at last he said, \"You appear to have  a good business, if I may judge by your merry song?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the Grinder, \"this business has a golden "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#2)"],[1,"old and feeble. One day Baucis  said to Philemon, \"I wish we might never die, but could always live  together.\"    \"Ah, that is my wish, too!\" sighed old Philemon.    The next morning the marble palace was gone; Baucis and Philemon were  gone; but there on the hilltop stood two beautiful trees, an oak and a  linden.    No one knew what became of the good people. After many years, however, a  traveler lying under the trees heard them whispering to each other.    \"Baucis,\" whispered the oak.    \"Philemon,\" replied the linden.    There the trees stood through sun and rain, always ready to spread their  leafy shade over every tired stranger who passed that way.    --FLORA J. COOKE.          THE POPLAR TREE      Long ago the poplar used to hold out its branches like other trees. It  tried to see how far it could spread them.    Once at sunset an old man came through the forest where the poplar trees  lived. The trees were going to sleep, and it was growing dark.    The man held something under his cloak. It was a pot of gold--the very  pot of gold that lies at the foot of the rainbow. He had stolen it and  was looking for some place to hide it. A poplar tree stood by the path.    \"This is the very place to hide my treasure,\" the man said. \"The  branches spread out straight, and the leaves are large and thick. How  lucky that the trees are all asleep!\"    He placed the pot of gold in the thick branches, and then ran quickly  away.    The gold belonged to Iris, the beautiful maiden who had a rainbow bridge  to the earth. The next morning she missed her precious pot. It always  lay at the foot of the rainbow, but it was not there now.    Iris hurried away to tell her father, the great Zeus, of her loss. He  said that he would find the pot of gold for her.    He called a messenger, the swift-footed Mercury, and said, \"Go quickly,  and do not return until you have found the treasure.\"    Mercury went as fast as the wind down to the earth. He soon came to the  forest and awakened the trees.    \"Iris has lost her precious pot of gold that lies at the foot of the  rainbow. Have any of you seen it?\" he asked.    The trees were very sleepy, but all shook their heads.    \"We have not seen it,\" they said.    \"Hold up your branches,\" said Mercury. \"I must see that the pot of gold  is not hidden among them.\"    All of the trees held up their branches. The poplar that stood by the  path was the first to hold up his. He was an honest tree and knew he had  nothing to hide.    [Illustration: Mercury among the trees]    Down fell the pot of gold. How surprised the poplar tree was! He dropped  his branches in shame. Then he held them high in the air.    \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I do not know how it came to be there; but,  hereafter, I shall always hold my branches up. Then every one can see  that I have nothing hidden.\"    Since then the branches have always grown straight up; and every one  knows that the poplar is an honest and upright tree.    --FLORA J. COOKE.          WHO LOVES THE TREES BEST?        Who loves the trees best?    \"I,\" said the Spring;    \"Their leaves so beautiful    To them I bring.\"      Who loves the trees best?    \"I,\" Summer said;    \"I give them blossoms,    White, yellow, red.\"      Who loves the trees best?    \"I,\" said the Fall;    \"I give luscious fruits,    Bright tints to all.\"      Who loves the trees best?    \"I love them best,\"    Harsh Winter answered;    \"I give them rest.\"    --ALICE MAY DOUGLAS.          LEAVES IN AUTUMN        Red and gold, and gold and red,    Autumn leaves burned overhead;      Hues so splendid      Softly blended,    Oh, the glory that they shed!    Red and gold, and gold and red.      Gold and brown, and brown and gold,    Of such fun the west wind told      That they listened,      And they glistened,    As they wrestled in the cold;    Gold and brown, and brown and gold.      Brown and gold, and red and brown,    How they hurried, scurried down      For a frolic,      For a rolic,    Through the country and the town,    Brown and gold, and red and brown.          [Illustration: A bird in a tree]    A STORY OF BIRD LIFE    I      Once there came to our fields a pair of birds. They had never built a  nest nor seen a winter.    Oh, how beautiful was everything! The fields were full of flowers, the  grass was growing tall, and the bees were humming everywhere.    One of the birds fell to singing, and the other bird said, \"Who told you  to sing?\"    He answered, \"The flowers and the bees told me. The blue sky told me,  and you told me.\"    \"When did I tell you to sing?\" asked his mate.    \"Every time you brought in tender grass for the nest,\" he replied.  \"Every time your soft wings fluttered off again for hair and feathers to  line it.\"    Then his mate asked, \"What are you singing about?\"    \"I am singing about everything,\" he answered. \"I sing because I am  happy.\"    By and by five little speckled eggs were in the nest, and the mother  bird asked, \"Is there anything in all the world as pretty as my eggs?\"    A week or two afterward, the mother said, \"Oh, what do you think has  happened? One of my eggs has been peeping and moving.\"    Soon another egg moved, then another, and another, till five eggs were  hatched.    The little birds were so hungry that it kept the parents busy feeding  them. Away they both flew. The moment the little birds heard them coming  back, five yellow mouths flew open wide.    \"Can anybody be happier?\" said the father bird to the mother bird. \"We  will live in this tree always. It is a tree that bears joy.\"      II      The very next day one of the birds dropped out of the nest, and in a  moment a cat ate it up. Only four remained, and the parent birds were  very sad. There was no song all that day, nor the next.    Soon the little birds were big enough to fly. The first bird that tried  his wings flew from one branch to another. His parents praised him, and  the other baby birds wondered how he had done it.    The little one was so proud of it that he tried again. He flew and flew  and couldn't stop flying. At last he fell plump! down by the kitchen  door. A little boy caught him and carried him into the house.    Now only three birds were left. The sun no longer seemed bright to the  birds, and they did not sing so often.    In a little time the other birds learned to use their wings, and they  flew away and away. They found their own food and made their own nests.    Then the old birds sat silent and looked at each other a long while. At  last the mother bird asked, \"Why don't you sing?\"    \"I can't sing,\" the father bird answered. \"I only think and think!\"    \"What are you thinking of?\"    \"I am thinking how everything changes. The leaves are falling, and soon  there will be no roof over our heads. The flowers are all gone. Last  night there was a frost. Almost all the birds have flown away, and I am  restless. Something calls me, and I feel that I must fly away, too.\"    [Illustration: Two birds flying over a field]    \"Let us fly away together!\" the mother bird said.    Then they rose silently up in the air. They looked to the north; far  away they saw the snow coming. They looked to the south; there they saw  green leaves.    All day they flew. All night they flew and flew, till they found a land  where there was no winter. There it was summer all the time; flowers  always blossomed and birds always sang.    --HENRY WARD BEECHER          BOB WHITE        There's a plump little chap in a speckled coat,    And he sits on the zigzag rails remote,    Where he whistles at breezy, bracing morn,    When the buckwheat is ripe, and stacked is the corn:    \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"      Is he hailing some comrade as blithe as he?    Now I wonder where Robert White can be!    O'er the billows of gold and amber grain    There is no one in sight--but, hark again:    \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"      Ah! I see why he calls; in the stubble there    Hide his plump little wife and babies fair!    So contented is he, and so proud of the same,    That he wants all the world to know his name:    \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"    --GEORGE COOPER.          HOW MARY GOT A NEW DRESS      Mary lived a long time ago. She was a little girl when your  great-great-grandmother was a little girl.    In those days all cloth had to be made at home. Aunt Dinah, Aunt Chloe,  and Aunt Dilsey were kept busy spinning and weaving to make clothes for  the whole plantation.    One day Mary's mother said, \"Aunt Dilsey, Mary needs a new dress, and I  want you to weave some cloth at once. Can you weave some very fine  cloth?\"    \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Aunt Dilsey. \"I have some cotton I've been saving to  make her a dress.\"    Aunt Dilsey got out the cards and carded the cotton smooth and fine.  Then she fastened a roll of this cotton to the spindle and sent the  wheel whirling around with a \"Zum-m-m-m--Zum-m-m-m!\"    Mary stood and watched the old woman.    [Illustration: Mary watching Aunt Dilsey at spinning wheel]    \"Aunt Dilsey,\" she said, \"the spinning wheel sings a song, and I know  what it says. Grandmother told me. It says,      'A hum and a whirl,    A twist and a twirl,    This is for the girl    With the golden curl!    Zum-m-m-m-m-m!    Zum-m-m-m-m-m!'\"    \"And that means you, honey,\" said Aunt Dilsey.    When the yarn was ready, Aunt Dilsey fastened it in the loom and began  to weave. The threads went over and under, over and under. As Aunt  Dilsey wove, she hummed. Mary stood by and sang this song,      \"Over and under and over we go,    Weaving the cotton as white as the snow,    Weaving the cloth for a dress, oh, ho!    As over and under and over we go.\"    After the cloth had been woven, Aunt Dilsey took it out of the loom.  Then she bleached it until it was as white as snow. Now it was ready to  be made into a dress.    \"Mother, do tell me how you are going to make the dress,\" said Mary.  \"Will it have ruffles on it like Sue's? Will it have trimming "]]]
