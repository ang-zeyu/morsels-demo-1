As she manifested no other progress to recovery despite the  administration of drugs, numerous-rubbings and liniments, the physician in  charge called the writer into consultation.    Physical Examination Aug. 20--A well-developed, fairly well nourished woman,  appearing to be about thirty-five years of age. Face wears an anxious  expression and she shuns the examiner's direct gaze. Movements of the right  hand and arm are now fairly free. There is no appreciable difficulty in any  of its functions according to tests made for ataxia, strength, recognition  of form, finer movements, etc., in fact, she uses this hand to write with,  as she cannot talk at all.  Such writing is free, unaccompanied by errors in  spelling, there is no elision of syllables and no difficulty in finding the  words desired.  The face is symmetrical on the two sides. There is no  evidence of paralysis of the facial muscles. In fact, the cranial nerves, by  detailed examination, are intact, except in so far as respiration and speech  are concerned. The right leg is held entirely spastic, the muscles on both  sides of the joints, that is, flexors and extensors, being equally  contracted. It is impossible to bend this leg at any joint except by the use  of very great force.  The reflexes everywhere are lively but are equal on  the two sides, and none of the abnormal reflexes is present, including in  this term Babinski, Gordon and Oppenheim.    Sensation--There is very markedly diminished reaction to pin prick all over  the right side, including face, arm, chest, leg and tongue. In some places  complete analgesia obtains.  Reaction to touch is likewise diminished and  recognition of heat and cold is impaired.    Speech--There is complete loss of the ability to make any sound, either  voiced or whispered; that is to say, there is complete aphonia,-- there is  loss of all voice.  The patient understands everything, however, and writes  her answers to questions rapidly and correctly. She can read whatever is  written, there is no difficulty in the recognition of objects, no evidence  of any aphasia whatever.    The diagnosis--hysteria--can hardly be doubted.  The history of headaches,  fainting spells without marked impairment of consciousness, vomiting spells,  hemianaesthesia, hemianalgesia, complete aphonia and an exaggerated  paralysis, not only of the right leg, but of the ability to thrust out the  tongue, while at the same time all other cranial functions were unimpaired  together with the apparent health of the individual in every other respect,  make up a syndrome hardly to pass unrecognized.    Treatment--The patient was entirely inaccessible to direct suggestion, for  no amount of assurance that her leg was all right enabled her to move it.  When such suggestions were made, she shook her head firmly and conclusively,  and this is true of suggestions concerning speech. This point is of  importance in the consideration of the mechanism. Attempts at hypnotism  failed ingloriously.  Psychoanalysis was deferred for the time, and recourse  was had to indirect suggestion and re-education.    The first function to be restored was the power of bending the leg which  hitherto had been held entirely spastic.  The patient was assured that while  she had lost the power of using the limb, a little relaxation of the muscles  of the front of the leg would permit it to be bent. Her attention was  distracted while at the same time a firm, steady pressure was put upon the  leg above and below the knee joint and advantage taken of every change in  the tone of the muscles involved in keeping the leg extended.  Little by  little the leg was bent until finally it was completely flexed, this for the  first time in three weeks. Her attention was called to this fact and she was  assured that upon the physician's next attempt to bend her leg, resistance  would be lessened and she would be able to aid somewhat as well.  This  proved true. Then the leg was only partly supported by the physician while  the patient was assured that with his help she would be able to bend it more  freely. From this, she passed on to the ability to move the leg without any  assistance on the part of the writer.  After having been given exercise in  bending the leg for some twenty or thirty times, with complete restoration  of this ability, she was induced to get out of bed, and while standing erect  she was suddenly released by the physician. She swayed to and fro in a  rather perilous manner but did not fall. Finally, by gradation of tasks set,  by a judicious combination of encouragement and command, she was enabled to  walk.  She was then put to bed and assured that upon the physician's next  visit she would be taught to walk freely.  Meanwhile, the husband was  instructed that he must not allow her to stay in bed more than an hour at a  time and that she must come to the table for her meals.    On the physician's next visit, two days later, it was found that the husband  had not been able to induce his wife to come to the table, and that he had  been unable to get her to walk.  The physician then commanded her to get out  of bed, which she did with great effort. She was then put back to bed and  instructed to get up more freely and without such effort, demonstration  being a visual one, in that she was shown how best to accomplish the task  set. Finally, at the end of the visit, she was walking quite freely and  promised in writing, for she had not as yet learned to talk, that she would  eat at the table.    The next day instruction was commenced along the lines of speech. Upon being  asked to thrust out her tongue, that organ was protruded only a short  distance, and she claimed, in writing, to be unable to protrude it further.  Thereupon it was taken hold of by a towel and alternately withdrawn from and  replaced into the mouth.  After a short period of such exercise she was  enabled to thrust the tongue in and out. She was then instructed to breathe  more freely; that is to say, to take short inspirations and to make long  expirations, this in preparation for speech. She was unable to do this, the  expiration being short, jerky and interrupted. Thereupon the examiner placed  his two hands, one on each side of her chest, instructed her to inspire, and  when she was instructed to expire forced his hands against her ribs in order  to complete the expiratory act. After about fifteen or twenty minutes of  this combination of instruction and help the patient was able to breathe by  herself and freely. She was then instructed to make the sound \"e\" at the end  of expiration. This she was unable to do at first, but upon persistence and  passive placing of her mouth in the proper position for the sound, she was  able to whisper \"e.\"  From this she rapidly went on to the other vowel  sounds. Then the aspirate \"h\" was added, later the explosives, \"p,\" etc.,  until at the end of about two hours she was enabled to whisper anything  desired. Her husband was instructed not to allow her to use her pencil any  more, and she promised faithfully to enter into whispered conversation with  him, although it was evident that she promised this with reluctance.    Upon the next visit, two days later, she was still whispering, and when  asked if she could talk aloud, shook her head and whispered \"No,\" that she  was sure she could not. Efforts to have her make the sound \"a,\" or any of  the vowels in a voiced manner failed completely.  She was then instructed to  cough. Although it is evident that a cough is a voiced sound, she was able  to do this, in a very low and indistinct manner. She was then instructed to  add the sound \"e\" at the end of her cough. This she did, but with  difficulty.  Finally, after much the same manoeuvering which has been  indicated in the account of how she was instructed to whisper, she talked  freely and well. When this was accomplished the husband was instructed to  have her dress herself and to take her to:  some place of amusement, and to  keep her out of doors almost continuously.    At all times the patient had complained of a pain in her side which she  claimed was the root of all her trouble. It had been \"doctored,\" to use her  term, by all the physicians in the city and, it was alleged, came after she  had been lifting a paralyzed old lady in the house across the way. Despite  all treatment this pain had not disappeared and the various diagnoses  made--strain, liver trouble, nervous ache had not sufficed to console the  patient or to relieve her.  There was no local tenderness, no pain upon  movement, but merely a steady ache. No physical basis whatever for this  trouble could be found. Her medicine for the relief of it was discontinued,  and so, too, were certain medicines she had been obtaining for sleep.    Upon each visit the husband and wife had been informed by the physician that  he did not believe the trouble was organic in its nature, that he believed  it depended upon some ideas that the patient had, and that, furthermore, it  was the result of some mental irritation, compared for the purpose of fixing  the point to a festering sore and which, if removed, would permanently  eliminate the liability of such seizures.  The patient and her husband were  informed that the physician intended to delve to the bottom of this trouble  and, by deferring investigation as to its exact nature until the symptoms  had practically disappeared, a way was cleared to obtain their complete  confidence, and at the same time to overcome any unwillingness to accept a  psychical explanation for such palpable physical ills. This latter point is  of importance in dealing with uneducated persons. For the most part, they  are intensely practical and materialistic, and a mere idea does not seem to  them to account for paralysis although, of course, such skepticism is  usually accompanied by superstitious credulity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],[0,"Balder the Beautiful, Volume I. (#2)"],[1,"prove, the oak is struck by lightning beyond any other tree of the wood  in Europe. To our rude forefathers, who dwelt in the gloomy depths of  the primaeval forest, it might well seem that the riven and blackened  oaks must indeed be favourites of the sky-god, who so often descended on  them from the murky cloud in a flash of lightning and a crash of  thunder.    This change of view as to the great Aryan god necessarily affects my  interpretation of the King of the Wood, the priest of Diana at Aricia,  if I may take that discarded puppet out of the box again for a moment.  On my theory the priest represented Jupiter in the flesh, and  accordingly, if Jupiter was primarily a sky-god, his priest cannot have  been a mere incarnation of the sacred oak, but must, like the deity  whose commission he bore, have been invested in the imagination of his  worshippers with the power of overcasting the heaven with clouds and  eliciting storms of thunder and rain from the celestial vault. The  attribution of weather-making powers to kings or priests is very common  in primitive society, and is indeed one of the principal levers by which  such personages raise themselves to a position of superiority above  their fellows. There is therefore no improbability in the supposition  that as a representative of Jupiter the priest of Diana enjoyed this  reputation, though positive evidence of it appears to be lacking.    Lastly, in the present edition I have shewn some grounds for thinking  that the Golden Bough itself, or in common parlance the mistletoe on the  oak, was supposed to have dropped from the sky upon the tree in a flash  of lightning and therefore to contain within itself the seed of  celestial fire, a sort of smouldering thunderbolt. This view of the  priest and of the bough which he guarded at the peril of his life has  the advantage of accounting for the importance which the sanctuary at  Nemi acquired and the treasure which it amassed through the offerings of  the faithful; for the shrine would seem to have been to ancient what  Loreto has been to modern Italy, a place of pilgrimage, where princes  and nobles as well as commoners poured wealth into the coffers of Diana  in her green recess among the Alban hills, just as in modern times kings  and queens vied with each other in enriching the black Virgin who from  her Holy House on the hillside at Loreto looks out on the blue Adriatic  and the purple Apennines. Such pious prodigality becomes more  intelligible if the greatest of the gods was indeed believed to dwell in  human shape with his wife among the woods of Nemi.    These are the principal points on which I have altered my opinion since  the last edition of my book was published. The mere admission of such  changes may suffice to indicate the doubt and uncertainty which attend  enquiries of this nature. The whole fabric of ancient mythology is so  foreign to our modern ways of thought, and the evidence concerning it is  for the most part so fragmentary, obscure, and conflicting that in our  attempts to piece together and interpret it we can hardly hope to reach  conclusions that will completely satisfy either ourselves or others. In  this as in other branches of study it is the fate of theories to be  washed away like children's castles of sand by the rising tide of  knowledge, and I am not so presumptuous as to expect or desire for mine  an exemption from the common lot. I hold them all very lightly and have  used them chiefly as convenient pegs on which to hang my collections of  facts. For I believe that, while theories are transitory, a record of  facts has a permanent value, and that as a chronicle of ancient customs  and beliefs my book may retain its utility when my theories are as  obsolete as the customs and beliefs themselves deserve to be.    I cannot dismiss without some natural regret a task which has occupied  and amused me at intervals for many years. But the regret is tempered by  thankfulness and hope. I am thankful that I have been able to conclude  at least one chapter of the work I projected a long time ago. I am  hopeful that I may not now be taking a final leave of my indulgent  readers, but that, as I am sensible of little abatement in my bodily  strength and of none in my ardour for study, they will bear with me yet  a while if I should attempt to entertain them with fresh subjects of  laughter and tears drawn from the comedy and the tragedy of man's  endless quest after happiness and truth.
