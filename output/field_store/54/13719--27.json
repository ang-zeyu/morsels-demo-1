Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled as she said:    \"'There's a stripe for every tear made in your old coat by the claws  of Mr. Bob Cat the day you saved Mr. Meadow Mouse. They are honor  stripes, and hereafter you and your children and your children's  children shall always wear stripes.'    \"And that is how it happens that Striped Chipmunk comes by his striped  coat, and why he is so proud of it, and takes such good care of it,\"  concluded Grandfather Frog.          II    WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS HANDS      Happy Jack Squirrel sat with his hands folded across his white  waistcoat. He is very fond of sitting with his hands folded that way.  A little way from him sat Peter Rabbit. Peter was sitting up very  straight, but his hands dropped right down in front. Happy Jack  noticed it.    \"Why don't you fold your hands the way I do, Peter Rabbit?\" shouted  Happy Jack.    \"I--I--don't want to,\" stammered Peter.    \"You mean you can't!\" jeered Happy Jack.    Peter pretended not to hear, and a few minutes later he hopped away  towards the dear Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip. Happy Jack  watched him go, and there was a puzzled look in Happy Jack's eyes.    \"I really believe he can't fold his hands,\" said Happy Jack to  himself, but speaking aloud.    \"He can't, and none of his family can,\" said a gruff voice.    Happy Jack turned to find Old Mr. Toad sitting in the Lone Little  Path.    \"Why not?\" asked Happy Jack.    \"Ask Grandfather Frog; he knows,\" replied Old Mr. Toad, and started on  about his business.    And this is how it happens that Grandfather Frog told this story to  the little meadow and forest people gathered around him on the bank of  the Smiling Pool.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog. \"Old Mr. Rabbit, the grandfather  a thousand times removed of Peter Rabbit, was always getting into  trouble. Yes, Sir, old Mr. Rabbit was always getting into trouble.  Seemed like he wouldn't be happy if he couldn't get into trouble. It  was all because he was so dreadfully curious about other people's  business, just as Peter Rabbit is now. It seemed that he was just born  to be curious and so, of course, to get into trouble.    \"One day word came to the Green Forest and to the Green Meadows that  Old Mother Nature was coming to see how all the little meadow and  forest people were getting along, to settle all the little troubles  and fusses between them, and to find out who were and who were not  obeying the orders she had given them when she had visited them last.  My, my, my, such a hurrying and scurrying and worrying as there was!  You see, everybody wanted to look his best when Old Mother Nature  arrived, Yes, Sir, everybody wanted to look his best.    \"There was the greatest changing of clothes you ever did see. Old King  Bear put on his blackest coat. Mr. Coon and Mr. Mink and Mr. Otter sat  up half the night brushing their suits and making them look as fine  and handsome as they could. Even Old Mr. Toad put on a new suit under  his old one, and planned to pull the old one off and throw it away as  soon as Old Mother Nature should arrive. Then everybody began to fix  up their homes and make them as neat and nice as they knew  how--everybody but Mr. Rabbit.    \"Now Mr. Rabbit was lazy. He didn't like to work any more than Peter  Rabbit does now. No, Sir, old Mr. Rabbit was afraid of work. The very  sight of work scared old Mr. Rabbit. You see, he was so busy minding  other people's business that he didn't have time to attend to his own.  So his brown and gray coat always was rumpled and tumbled and dirty.  His house was a tumble-down affair in which no one but Mr. Rabbit  would ever have thought of living, and his garden--oh, dear me, such a  garden you never did see! It was all weeds and brambles. They filled  up the yard, and old Mr. Rabbit actually couldn't have gotten into his  own house if he hadn't cut a path through the brambles.    \"Now when old Mr. Rabbit heard that Old Mother Nature was coming, his  heart sank way, way down, for he knew just how angry she would be when  she saw his house, his garden and his shabby suit.    \"'Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?' wailed Mr. Rabbit, wringing  his hands.    \"'Get busy and clean up,' advised Mr. Woodchuck, hurrying about his  own work.    \"Now Mr. Woodchuck was a worker and very, very neat. He meant to have  his home looking just as fine as he could make it. He brought up some  clean yellow sand from deep down in the ground and sprinkled it  smoothly over his doorstep.    \"'I'll help you, if I get through my own work in time,' shouted Mr.  Woodchuck over his shoulder.    \"That gave Mr. Rabbit an idea. He would ask all his neighbors to help  him, and perhaps then he could get his house and garden in order by  the time Old Mother Nature arrived. So Mr. Rabbit called on Mr. Skunk  and Mr. Coon and Mr. Mink and Mr. Squirrel and Mr. Chipmunk, and all  the rest of his neighbors, telling them of his trouble and asking them  to help. Now, in spite of the trouble Mr. Rabbit was forever making  for other people by his dreadful curiosity and meddling with other  people's affairs, all his neighbors had a warm place in their hearts  for Mr. Rabbit, and they all promised that they would help him as soon  as they had their own work finished.    \"Instead of hurrying home and getting to work himself, Mr. Rabbit  stopped a while after each call and sat with his arms folded, watching  the one he was calling on work. Mr. Rabbit was very fond of sitting  with folded arms. It was very comfortable. But this was no time to be  doing it, and Mr. Skunk told him so.    \"'If you want the rest of us to help you, you'd better get things  started yourself,' said old Mr. Skunk, carefully combing out his big,  plumy tail.    \"'That's right, Mr. Skunk! That's right!' said Mr. Rabbit, starting  along briskly, just as if he was going to hurry right home and begin  work that very instant.    \"But half an hour later, when Mr. Skunk happened to pass the home of  Mr. Chipmunk, there sat Mr. Rabbit with his arms folded, watching Mr.  Chipmunk hurrying about as only Mr. Chipmunk can.    \"Finally Mr. Rabbit had made the round of all his friends and  neighbors, and he once more reached his tumble-down house. 'Oh, dear,'  sighed Mr. Rabbit, as he looked at the tangle of brambles which almost  hid the little old house, 'I never, never can clear away all this! It  will be a lot easier to work when all my friends are here to help,'  So he sighed once more and folded his arms, instead of beginning work  as he should have done. And then, because the sun was bright and warm,  and he was very, very comfortable, old Mr. Rabbit began to nod, and  presently he was fast asleep.    \"Now Old Mother Nature likes to take people by surprise, and it  happened that she chose this very day to make her promised visit. She  was greatly pleased with all she saw as she went along, until she came  to the home of Mr. Rabbit.    \"'Mercy me!' exclaimed Old Mother Nature, throwing up her hands as she  saw the tumble-down house almost hidden by the brambles and weeds.  'Can it be possible that any one really lives here?'    Then, peering through the tangle of brambles, she spied old Mr.  Rabbit sitting on his broken-down doorstep with his arms folded and  fast asleep.    \"At first she was very indignant, oh, very indignant, indeed! She  decided that Mr. Rabbit should be punished very severely. But as she  watched him sitting there, dreaming in the warm sunshine, her anger  began to melt away. The fact is, Old Mother Nature was like all the  rest of Mr. Rabbit's neighbors--she just couldn't help loving  happy-go-lucky Mr. Rabbit in spite of all his faults. With a long  stick she reached in and tickled the end of his nose.    \"Mr. Rabbit sneezed, and this made him wake up. He yawned and blinked,  and then his eyes suddenly flew wide open with fright. He had  discovered Old Mother Nature frowning at him. She pointed a long  forefinger at him and said:        'In every single blessed day       There's time for work and time for play.       Who folds his arms with work undone       Doth cheat himself and spoil his fun.'    \"'Hereafter, Mr. Rabbit, you and your children and your children's  children will never again be able to sit with folded arms until you or  they have learned to work.'    \"And that is why Peter Rabbit cannot fold his arms and still lives in  a tumble-down house among the brambles,\" concluded Grandfather  Frog.          III    WHY UNC' BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD      One thing puzzled Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk a  great deal after they had come to know Unc' Billy Possum and his funny  ways. They had talked it over and wondered and wondered about it, and  tried to understand it, and even had asked Unc' Billy about it. Unc'  Billy had just grinned and said that they would have to ask his mammy.  Of course they couldn't do that, and Unc' Billy knew they couldn't,  for Unc' Billy's mammy had died long before he even thought of coming  up from Ol' Virginny to the Green Forest and the Green Meadows where  they lived. He said it just to tease them, and when he said it, he  chuckled until they chuckled too, just as if it really were the best  kind of a joke.    Now you know it always is the thing that you try and try to find out  and can't find out that you most want to find out. It was just so with  Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk. The more they  talked about it, the more they wanted to know. Why was it that Unc'  Billy Possum played dead instead of trying to run away when he was  surprised by his enemies? They always tried to run away. So did  everybody else of their acquaintance excepting Unc' Billy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#2)"],[1,"would lie    And thrice his Master dear deny.      For 'tis a law that sin is done    Before the herald of the sun    To humankind the dawn proclaims    And with his cry the sinner shames.      Then wept he bitter tears aghast    That from his lips the words had passed,    Though guileless he his soul possessed    And faith still reigned within his breast.      Nor ever reckless word he said    Thereafter, by his tongue betrayed,    But at the cock's familiar cry    Humbled he turned from vanity.      Therefore it is we hold to-day    That, as the world in stillness lay,    What hour the cock doth greet the skies,    Christ from deep Hades did arise.      Lo! then the bands of death were burst,    Shattered the sway of hell accurst:    Then did the Day's superior might    Swiftly dispel the hosts of Night.      Now let base deeds to silence fall,    Black thoughts be stilled beyond recall:    Now let sin's opiate spell retire    To that deep sleep it doth inspire.      For all the hours that still remain    Until the dark his goal attain,    Alert for duty's stern command    Let every soul a sentry stand.      With sober prayer on Jesus call;    Let tears with our strong crying fall;    Sleep cannot on the pure soul steal    That supplicates with fervent zeal.      Too long did dull oblivion cloud    Our motions and our senses shroud:    Lulled by her numbing touch, we stray    In dreamland's ineffectual way.      Bound by the dazzling world's soft chain    'Tis false and fleeting gauds we gain,    Like those who in deep slumbers lie:--    Let us awake! the truth is nigh.      Gold, honours, pleasure, wealth and ease,    And all the joys that mortals please,    Joys with a fatal glamour fraught--    When morning comes, lo! all are nought.      But thou, O Christ, put sleep to flight    And break the iron bands of night,    Free us from burden of past sin    And shed Thy morning rays within.                                    II. HYMNUS MATUTINUS          Nox et tenebrae et nubila,    confusa mundi et turbida,    lux intrat, albescit polus,    Christus venit, discedite.        Caligo terrae scinditur          5    percussa solis spiculo,    rebusque iam color redit    vultu nitentis sideris.        Sic nostra mox obscuritas    fraudisque pectus conscium        10    ruptis retectum nubibus    regnante pallescit Deo.        Tunc non licebit claudere    quod quisque fuscum cogitat,    sed mane clarescent novo          15    secreta mentis prodita.        Fur ante lucem squalido    inpune peccat tempore,    sed lux dolis contraria    latere furtum non sinit.          20        Versuta fraus et callida    amat tenebris obtegi,    aptamque noctem turpibus    adulter occultus fovet.        Sol ecce surgit igneus,         25    piget, pudescit, paenitet,    nec teste quisquam lumine    peccare constanter potest.        Quis mane sumptis nequiter    non erubescit poculis,            30    cum fit libido temperans    castumque nugator sapit?        Nunc, nunc severum vivitur,    nunc nemo tentat ludicrum,    inepta nunc omnes sua             35    vultu colorant serio.        Haec hora cunctis utilis,    qua quisque, quod studet, gerat,    miles, togatus, navita,    opifex, arator, institor.         40        Illum forensis gloria,    hunc triste raptat classicum,    mercator hinc ac rusticus    avara suspirant lucra.        At nos lucelli ac faenoris      45    fandique prorsus nescii,    nec arte fortes bellica,    te, Christe, solum novimus.        Te mente pura et simplici,    te voce, te cantu pio             50    rogare curvato genu    flendo et canendo discimus.        His nos lucramur quaestibus,    hac arte tantum vivimus,    haec inchoamus munera,            55    cum sol resurgens emicat.        Intende nostris sensibus,    vitamque totam dispice,    sunt multa fucis inlita,    quae luce purgentur tua.          60        Durare nos tales iube,    quales, remotis sordibus    nitere pridem iusseras,    Iordane tinctos flumine.        Quodcumque nox mundi dehinc     65    infecit atris nubibus,    tu, rex Eoi sideris,    vultu sereno inlumina.        Tu sancte, qui taetram picem    candore tingis lacteo             70    ebenoque crystallum facis,    delicta terge livida.        Sub nocte Iacob caerula    luctator audax angeli,    eo usque dum lux surgeret,        75    sudavit inpar praelium.        Sed cum iubar claresceret,    lapsante claudus poplite    femurque victus debile    culpae vigorem perdidit.          80        Nutabat inguen saucium,    quae corporis pars vilior    longeque sub cordis loco    diram fovet libidinem.        Hae nos docent imagines,        85    hominem tenebris obsitum,    si forte non cedat Deo,    vires rebellis perdere.        Erit tamen beatior,    intemperans membrum cui           90    luctando claudum et tabidum    dies oborta invenerit.        Tandem facessat caecitas,    quae nosmet in praeceps diu    lapsos sinistris gressibus        95    errore traxit devio.        Haec lux serenum conferat    purosque nos praestet sibi:    nihil loquamur subdolum,    volvamus obscurum nihil.         100        Sic tota decurrat dies,    ne lingua mendax, ne manus,    oculive peccent lubrici,    ne noxa corpus inquinet.        Speculator adstat desuper,     105    qui nos diebus omnibus    actusque nostros prospicit    a luce prima in vesperum.        Hic testis, hic est arbiter,    his intuetur quidquid est,       110    humana quod mens concipit;    hunc nemo fallit iudicem.                                     II. MORNING HYMN        Ye clouds and darkness, hosts of night    That breed confusion and affright,    Begone! o'erhead the dawn shines clear,    The light breaks in and Christ is here.      Earth's gloom flees broken and dispersed,    By the sun's piercing shafts coerced:    The daystar's eyes rain influence bright    And colours glimmer back to sight.      So shall our guilty midnight fade,    The sin-stained heart's gross dusky shade:    So shall the King's All-radiant Face    Sudden unveil our deep disgrace.      No longer then may we disguise    Our dark intents from those clear eyes:    Yea, at the dayspring's advent blest    Our inmost thoughts will stand confest.      The thief his hidden traffic plies    Unmarked before the dawn doth rise:    But light, the foe of guile concealed,    Lets no ill craft lie unrevealed.      Fraud and Deceit love only night,    Their wiles they practise out of sight;    Curtained by dark, Adultery too    Doth his foul treachery pursue,      But slinks abashed and shamed away    Soon as the sun rekindles day,    For none can damning light resist    And 'neath its rays in sin persist.      Who doth not blush o'ertook by morn    And his long night's carousal scorn?    For day subdues the lustful soul,    And doth all foul desires control.      Now each to earnest life awakes,    Now each his wanton sport forsakes;    Now foolish things are put away    And gravity resumes her sway.      It is the hour for duty's deeds,    The path to which our labour leads,    Be it the forum, army, sea,    The mart or field or factory.      One seeks the plaudits of the bar,    One the stern trumpet calls to war:    Those bent on trade and husbandry    At greed's behest for lucre sigh.      Mine is no rhetorician's fame,    No petty usury I claim;    Nor am I skilled to face the foe:    'Tis Thou, O Christ, alone I know.      Yea, I have learnt to wait on Thee    With heart and lips of purity,    Humbly my knees in prayer to bend,    And tears with songs of praise to blend.      These are the gains I hold in view    And these the arts that I pursue:    These are the offices I ply    When the bright sun mounts up the sky.      Prove Thou my heart, my every thought,    Search into all that I have wrought:    Though I be stained with blots within,    Thy quickening rays shall purge my sin.      O may I ever spotless be    As when my stains were cleansed by Thee,    Who bad'st me 'neath the Jordan's wave    Of yore my soiled spirit lave.      If e'er since then the world's gross night    Hath cast its curtain o'er my sight,    Dispel the cloud, O King of grace,    Star of the East! with thy pure face.      Since Thou canst change, O holy Light,    The blackest hue to milky white,    Ebon to clearness crystalline,    Wash my foul stains and make me clean.      'Twas 'neath the lonely star-blue night    That Jacob waged the unequal fight,    Stoutly he wrestled with the Man    In darkness, till the day began.      And when the sun rose in the sky    He halted on his shrivelled thigh:    His natural might had ebbed away,    Vanquished in that tremendous fray.      Not wounded he in nobler part    Nor smitten in life's fount, the heart:    But lust was shaken from his throne    And his foul empire overthrown.      Whereby we clearly learn aright    That man is whelmed by deadly night,    Unless he own God conqueror    And strive against His will no more.      Yet happier he whom rising morn    Shall find of nature's strength forlorn,    Whose warring flesh hath shrunk away,    Palsied by virtue's puissant sway.      And then at length let darkness flee,    Which all too long held us in fee,    'Mid wildering shadows made us stray    And led in devious tracks our way.      We pray Thee, Rising Light serene,    E'en as Thyself our hearts make clean:    Let no deceit our lips defile    Nor let our souls be vexed by guile.      O keep us, as the hours proceed,    From lying word and evil deed,    Our roving eyes from sin set free,    Our body from impurity.      For thou dost from above survey    The converse of each fleeting day:    Thou dost foresee from morning light    Our every deed, until the night.      Justice and judgment dwell with Thee,    Whatever is, Thine eye doth see:    Thou know'st what human hearts conceive    And none Thy wisdom may deceive.                                  III.
