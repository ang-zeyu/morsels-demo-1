What effect has Madame Sand had upon me, after the few gifted women,  and many charming women whom I have known--after those daughters of  the earth, who like Madame Sand said with Sappho: \"Come, Mother of  Love, to our delicious banquets, fill our cups with the nectar of  roses?\" As I have placed myself now in fiction and now in reality, the  author of Valentine has made on me two very different impressions.    As for fiction, I do not speak of it, for I ought no longer to  understand its language; as for reality, a man of grave age,  cherishing the notions of propriety, attaching as a Christian the  highest value to the timid virtue of woman. I know not how to express  my unhappiness at such a mass of rich endowments bestowed on the  prodigal and faithless hours which are spent and vanish.           *       *       *       *       *    MARIA BROOKS AND SOUTHEY.    It is well known that our countrywoman MARIA DEL OCCIDENTE was on  terms of familiar intimacy with the poet-laureate, whose admiration  of her genius is illustrated in several allusions to her in his works,  and particularly in that passage of \"The Doctor\" in which she is  described as \"the most impassioned and imaginative of all poetesses.\"  Southey superintended the publication of \"Zophiel,\" in London, and  afterward was a frequent correspondent of Mrs. Brooks, during her  residence in New York and in Cuba. Among the souvenirs of Mrs.  Brooke's grateful recollection of his kindness, are two or three short  poems commemorating her visits to Keswick, and the following song, put  into a lyrical form by her, from the blank verse of \"Madoc.\"    PRINCE HOEL'S LAY OF LOVE.      I've harnessed thee, my faithful steed--    Now, by the ocean, prove thy speed,    While, as we pass, th' advancing spray    Shall kiss thy side of glossy gray;--    Oh! fairer than the ocean foam    Is that cold maid for whom we roam!      Her cheek is like the apple flower    Or summer heavens, at evening hour,    While, in her tender bashfulness,    She starts and files my love's excess,    Tho' dim my brow, beneath its mail,    As ocean when the sun is pale.      On, on! until my longing sight,    Can fix upon that dwelling white,    Beside a verdant bank that braves    The ocean's ever-sounding waves;--    There, all alone, she loves to sing,    Watching the silver sea-mew's wing.      In crowded halls, my spirit flies    To wait upon her; and wasting sighs    Consume my nights; where'er I turn    For her I pant, for her I burn,    Who, like some timid, graceful bird,    Shrinks from my glance and fears my word.      I faint; my glow of youth is gone;    Sleepless at night and sick at morn,    My strength departs; I droop, I fade,    Yet think upon that lonely maid,    And pity her, the while I pine    That she should spurn a love like mine      _This_, Madoc took the harp to play;    Cold in the earth Prince Hoel lay;    And Llaian listened, fain to speak    But wept as if her heart would break.    In this connection, writing of Southey, soon after intelligence was  received in this country of the decay of his intelligence, from her  coffee estate in Cuba, Mrs. Brooks says:        When a child of ten years old I could admire the poem \"Madoc,\"      such is the simplicity of its sentiments and the beauty of      its delineations. Looking it over, here, (amidst the woods and      canes of that island where repose the bones of Columbus,) the      song of Prince Hoel attached itself to my thoughts, and has      been (involuntarily) put into rhyme. This song may be found in      the first part of the poem mentioned. The lyric metre in which      it now appears must rather injure than improve the _belle      nature_ of the original. Still I wish it to be published, as      coming from my hand; because it gives me an opportunity of      expressing, in some degree, my unqualified admiration of its      composer. Well may he be called THE POET AND HISTORIAN OF THE      NEW WORLD. To justify this appellation, one has only to look      at Madoc and the History of Brazil. I have heard, from a      friend, of a rumor that Southey is ill; and, as it is feared,      irrecoverably.    This intelligence is unexpected as it is melancholy; for who had  better reason to look forward to a protracted existence upon earth,  than he who has written more than any other man except Voltaire--than  Robert Southey, perfectly proportioned in person, just in mind,  regular in his way of living, and benevolent in all his doings?    During that Spring which hallowed the last revolution in France, (that  of July, 1830,) I saw this bard of the lakes surrounded by his most  amiable and certainly beautiful family; one only individual of which,  his \"Dark-eyed Birtha, timid as a dove,\" was then absent. I must  ever believe that a common reputation for beauty depends more on  circumstances than on any particular faultlessness in the person said  generally to be handsome.    Byron, in some one of the letters or conversations, written either  by or for him, says, or is said to say: \"I saw Southey (naming the  time) at Lord Holland's, and would give Newstead for his head and  shoulders.\" This quotation is from memory, but, I trust, right in  sentiment, though it may not be perfectly so in words; but I have  seen little else concerning the physique either of him \"Who framed of  Thalaba that wild and wondrous song,\" or of those to whom his blood is  transmitted. Still, at the time I have mentioned, it was impossible to  look unmoved upon so much perfection of color, sound and expression as  arrested my eyes at Keswick; in the tasteful and hospitable dwelling  of him who brought to earth that \"Glendoveer,\" \"one of the fairest  race of Heaven,\" (the heaven of India,) who averted the designs of  Arvalan, in that glowing and magnificent poem \"The Curse of Kehama.\"    The Herodotus of Brazil, himself, had seen, when I first saw him,  fifty-seven winters; but his once dark locks, though sprinkled with  snow, were still curling as if childhood had not passed; and looked  wild and thick as those of his own Thalaba. A \"chevelure\" like this,  with black eyes, aquiline features, and figure tall and slender,  without attenuation, assisted in presenting such an image as is seldom  viewed in reality; while the effect of the whole was enhanced by easy,  unpretending and affectionate manners.    The eldest daughter of this Minstrel of the Mountains was called  _Edith May_, (the name of May having been given because she was born  in the month of blossoms.) This lady (now Mrs. Warter,) was the bard  himself with a different sex and complexion. \"Her features his, but  softened.\" Her gentle, graceful deportment was in perfect harmony with  flaxen hair tinted with gold; and the outline of her father's face  was embellished by the blue eyes and other delicate colors of her too  sensitive mother, (named, also, Edith,) who had been chosen for love  alone. The second daughter, Birtha, as I have said, was absent. The  third, Catherine, \"between the woman and the child,\" had hazel eyes  and fine features, altogether with a delicate shape and complexion.  Cuthbert, the only son, was a boy of eleven or twelve, with an open,  expressive countenance.    I could not help remarking that in the names of each individual of  this pleasing group was heard that sound produced by the letter T  followed by its companion H, which is so difficult to the organs of  foreigners, but which, when tenderly pronounced, brings to mind  the down of a swan or the wing of a dove. Edith, Birtha, Catherine,  Cuthbert, Southey. If affection and innocence can insure felicity on  earth, the course of their lives must be smooth as waters where the  swan reposes; for certainly all their movements seemed innocent as  those of the dove.    The month of March was nearly half gone, when I reached Keswick,  by the road from Edinburgh; having passed, in my way, an old stone  building, pointed out to me as \"Branksome Tower,\" known by the \"Lay of  the Last Minstrel,\" who has sung the achievements of Scottish knights  and ladies. This village, at the foot of Skiddaw, though much visited  in the summer, has still all the wildness of nature. Daffodils were  in blossom when I walked there; and primroses, daisies and violets  opened, among the trees, upon every bank and grass plat, while the  mountains, clustering about Derwent Water, assumed such tints and  shades of purple and blue as are peculiar to a northern climate.      \"Oh, man, thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear!\"    All these pleasing images seemed to flit before me while putting into  rhyme the \"Song of Prince Hoel,\"--but before I could write it down,  tidings reached me of the illness, (perhaps incurable,) of him who  drew it from the oblivion of its native Welsh.    Death already has robbed me of so much, that I have become, as it  were, inured to grief, and accustomed, even in my least unhappy  moments to reflect on the incertitude of all earthly hopes and wishes.  I can now hear of losses with melancholy rather than with horror.    So much of the soul of Robert Southey has been dispersed about the  world that a translation to some other state of being, (now, before  time has given him any burthen to carry,) would be, perhaps, no  misfortune, except to those left to sorrow. Yet to know that so  benevolent a being is still existing, feeling, joying, and suffering,  on the sphere of our own mortality, awakens a feeling so nearly allied  to pleasure that all who can appreciate excellence must entreat of  Heaven the continuance upon earth of a contemporary of whom it may be  said:      \"VIRTUE AND HE ARE ONE!\"           *       *       *       *       *    MISS LESLIE'S LIFE OF JOHN FITCH.    It has been announced for years that Miss Leslie--the very clever but  not altogether amiable magazinist--was engaged upon a memoir of JOHN  FITCH, to whom, it has always seemed to us, was due "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"of the life of Eugene Field in the following  pages I have received assistance from many sources, but none has been  of so great value as that from his father's friend, Melvin L. Gray, in  whose home Field found the counsel of a father and the loving sympathy  of a mother. The letters Mr. Gray placed at my disposal, whether  quoted herein or not, have been invaluable in filling in the portrait  of his beloved ward.    To Edward D. Cowen, whose intimate friendship with Field covered a  period of nearly fifteen years in three cities and under varying  circumstances, these pages owe very much. From his brother, Roswell  Field, I have had the best sort of sympathetic aid and counsel in  filling out biographical detail without in any way committing himself  to the views or statements of this study.    Dr. Frank W. Reilly, to whom Field not only owed his vitalized  familiarity with Horace, \"Prout,\" and \"Kit North,\" but that  superficial knowledge of medical terms of which he made such constant  and effective use throughout his writings, has also placed me under  many obligations for data and advice.    To these and the others whose names are freely sprinkled through this  study I wish to make fitting acknowledgment of my many obligations,  and I trust the reader will share my grateful sentiments wherever the  faithful quotation marks remind him that such is their due.

The one introduced him to the study of British  balladry, the other led him to the classic groves of Horace.    \"I am a Yankee by pedigree and education,\" wrote Eugene Field to Alice  Morse Earle, the author of \"The Sabbath in Puritan New England,\" and  other books of the same flavor, \"but I was born in that ineffably  uninteresting city, St. Louis.\"    How so devoted a child of all that is queer and contradictory in New  England character came to be born in \"Poor old Mizzoorah,\" as he so  often wrote it, is in itself a rare romance, which I propose to tell  as the key to the life and works of Eugene Field. Part of it is told  in the reports of the Supreme Court of Vermont, part in the most  remarkable special pleas ever permitted in a chancery suit in America,  and the best part still lingers in the memory of the good people of  Newfane and Brattleboro, Vt., where \"them Field boys\" are still  referred to as unaccountable creatures, full of odd conceits, \"an'  dredful sot when once they took a notion.\"    \"Them Field boys\" were not Eugene and his brother Roswell Martin  Field, the joint authors of translations from Horace, known as \"Echoes  from the Sabine Farm,\" but their father, Roswell Martin, and their  uncle, Charles Kellogg, Field of Newfane aforesaid.    These two Fields were the sons of General Martin Field, who was born  in Leverett, Mass., February 12th, 1773, and of his wife, Esther Smith  Kellogg, who was the grandmother celebrated in more than one of Eugene  Field's stories and poems. Through both sides of the houses of Field  and Kellogg the pedigree of Eugene can be traced back to the first  settlers of New England. But there is no need to go back of the second  generation to find and identify the seed whence sprang the strangely  interesting subject of this study.    At the opening of the nineteenth century, as now, Newfane, then  Fayetteville, was a typical county seat. This pretty New England  village, which celebrated the centennial of its organization as a town  in 1874, is situated on the West River, some twelve miles from  Brattleboro, at which point that noisy stream joins the more sedate  Connecticut River. It nestles under the hills upon which, at a  distance of two miles, was the site of the original town of  Newfane--not a vestige of which remains to remind the traveller that  up to 1825 the shire town of Windham County overlooked as grand a  panorama as ever opened up before the eye of man. The reason for  abandoning the exposed location on the hills for the sheltered nook by  the river may be inferred from the descriptive adjectives. The present  town of Newfane clusters about a village square, that would have  delighted the heart of Oliver Goldsmith. The county highway bisects  it. The Windham County Hotel, with the windows of its northern end  grated to prevent the escape of inmates--signifying that its keeper is  half boniface and half county jailer--bounds it on the east, the Court  House and Town Hall, separate buildings, flank it on the west. The  Newfane Hotel rambles along half of its northern side, and the Field  mansion, with its front garden stretching to the road, does the same  for the southern half. In the rear, and facing the opening between the  Court House and the Town Hall, stands the Congregational Church, where  Eugene Field crunched caraway-seed biscuits when on a visit to his  grandmother, and back of this stands another church, spotless in the  white paint of Puritan New England meeting-houses, but deserted by its  congregation of Baptists, which had dwindled to the vanishing point.  In the centre of the village green is a grove of noble elms under  whose grateful shade, on the day of my visit to Newfane, I saw a  quartette of gray-headed attorneys, playing quoits with horse-shoes.  They had come up from Brattleboro to try a case, which had suffered  the usual \"law's delay\" of a continuance, and were whiling away the  hours in the bucolic sport of their ancestors, while the idle  villagers enjoyed their unpractised awkwardness. They all boasted how  they could ring the peg when they were boys.    Hither General Martin Field brought the young, and, as"]]]
