You see, that bear  just hid in the stump, waiting for helpless animals to come along, and  then he'd trick them into jumping down inside of it, and there wasn't a  word of truth about him having sore eyes, or about him having to wear dark  spectacles, either.    \"Oh, my! I guess this is the end of my adventures,\" thought the rabbit. \"I  should have been more careful. Well, I wish I could see Sammie and Susie  before he eats me, but I'm afraid I can't. I shouldn't have jumped down  here.\"    But as Uncle Wiggily happened to think of Sammie Littletail, the boy  rabbit, he also thought of something else. And this was that Sammie had  put something in the old gentleman rabbit's valise that morning, before  his uncle had started off.    \"If you ever get into trouble, Uncle Wiggily,\" Sammie had said, \"this may  come in useful for you.\" Uncle Wiggily didn't look at the time to see  what it was that his nephew put in the valise, but he made up his mind he  would do so now. So he opened his satchel, and there, among other things,  was a long piece of thin, but strong rope. And pinned to it was a note  which read:    \"Dear Uncle Wiggily. This is good to help you get out of a window, in case  of fire.\"    \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, \"that's fine. There the bear is  making a fire to cook me, and with this rope I can get away from it. Now  if there's only a window in this closet I'm all right.\"    So he looked, and sure enough there was a window. And with his crutch  Uncle Wiggily raised it. Then he threw out his satchel, and he tied the  rope to a hook on the window sill, and, being a strong old gentleman, he  crawled out of the window, and slid down the cord.    And Uncle Wiggily got out just as the bear opened the closet door to grab  him, and put him in the pot, and when the savage black creature saw his  fine rabbit dinner getting away he was as angry as anything, really he  was.    \"Here! Come back here!\" cried the bear, but of course Uncle Wiggily knew  better than to come back. He slid down the rope to the ground, and then he  cut off as much of the rope as he could, and put it in his pocket, for he  didn't know when he might need it again. Then, catching up his valise, he  ran on and on, before the bear could get to him.    It was still quite a dark place in which Uncle Wiggily was, for you see he  was underground, down by the roots of the stump. But he looked ahead and  he saw a little glimmer of light, and then he knew he could get out.    Limping on his crutch, and carrying his valise, he went on and on, and  pretty soon he came out of a dark cave and found himself on the bank of a  nice little brook, that was running over mossy, green stones.    \"Ha! This is better than being in a bear's den!\" exclaimed the old  gentleman rabbit. \"My, I was so frightened that I forgot about my  rheumatism hurting me. That was an adventure all right, and Sammie was a  good boy to think of that strong cord. Now what shall I do next?\"    Well, Uncle Wiggily sat down on the bank of the brook, and he looked in  the water. Then he happened to see a fish jump up to catch a bug, so he  said to himself:    \"I guess I will go fishing, just for fun. But if I do happen to catch any  fish I'll put them right back in the water again. For I don't need any  fish, as I have some lettuce and cabbage sandwiches, and some  peanut-butter cakes, that Susie's mamma put up in a cracker-box for me.\"    Well, Uncle Wiggily looked in his valise, to make sure his lunch was safe,  and then, taking a bent pin from under his vest, he fastened it to a part  of the string Sammie had given him. Then he fastened the string to a pole,  and he was ready to fish, but he needed something to make the fishes  bite--that is, bite the pinhook, not bite him, you know.    \"Oh, I guess they'll like a bit of sweet cracker,\" Uncle Wiggily thought;  so he put some on the end of the pin-hook, and threw it toward the water.    It fell in with a splash, and made a lot of little circles, like  ring-around the rosies, and the rabbit sat there looking at them, sort of  nodding, and half asleep and wondering what adventure would happen to him  next, and where he would stay that night. All of a sudden he felt  something tugging at the hook and line.    \"Oh, I've got a fish! I've got a fish!\" he cried, as he lifted up the  pole. Up out of the water with a sizzling rush flew the string and the  sweet cracker bait, and the next minute out leaped the big, savage  alligator that had escaped from a circus.    \"Oh, ho! So you tried to catch me, eh?\" the alligator shouted at Uncle  Wiggily.    \"No--no, if you please,\" said the rabbit. \"I was after fish.\"    \"And I'm after you!\" cried the alligator, and, scrambling up the bank, he  made a jump for Uncle Wiggily, and with one sweep of his kinky, scaly  tail he flopped and he threw the old gentleman rabbit and his crutch and  valise right up into a big tree that grew near the brook.    \"There you'll stay until I get ready to eat you!\" exclaimed the alligator,  as he stood up on the end of his tail under the tree, and opened his mouth  as wide as he could so that if Uncle Wiggily fell down he'd fall into it,  just like down a funnel, you know.    Well, the poor gentleman rabbit clung to the topmost tree branch,  wondering how in the world he was going to escape from the alligator. Oh,  it was a dreadful position to be in!    But please don't worry or stay awake over it, for I'll find a way to get  him down safely. And in the story after this, if the milkman doesn't leave  us sour cream for our lemonade, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the  black crow.          STORY III    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BLACK CROW      Let me see, where did I leave off in the last story? Oh! I remember. It  was about Uncle Wiggily Longears being up in the top of the tall tree, and  the alligator keeping guard down below, ready to eat him.    Well, the old gentleman rabbit was wondering how he could ever escape, and  he felt quite badly about it.    \"I guess this is the end of my adventures,\" he said to himself. \"It would  have been much better had I stayed at home with Sammie and Susie.\" And as  he thought of the two rabbit children he felt still sadder, and very  lonely.    \"I wonder if Susie could have put anything in my satchel with which to  scare an alligator,\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"I guess I'll look.\" So he  looked, and what should he find but a bottle of toothache drops. Yes,  there it was, and wrapped ground it was a little note Susie had written.    \"Dear Uncle Wiggily,\" she said in the note, \"if you ever get the  toothache on your travels, this will stop it.\"    \"Ha! That is very kind of Susie, I'm sure,\" said the rabbit, \"but I don't  see how that is going to make the alligator go away. And, even if he does  go, I wonder how I'm to get down out of this tall tree, with my crutch, my  valise and my rheumatism?\"    Well, just then the alligator got tired of standing on the end of his  tail, with his mouth open, and he began crawling around. Then he thought  of what a good supper he was going to have of Uncle Wiggily, and that  alligator said:    \"I guess I'll sharpen my teeth so I can eat him better,\" and with that the  savage and unpleasant creature began to gnaw on a stone, to sharpen his  teeth. Then he stood up on the end of his tail once more, under the tree,  and opened his mouth as wide as he could.    \"Come on now!\" he called to Uncle Wiggily. \"Jump down and have it over  with.\"    \"Oh, but I don't want to,\" objected the rabbit.    \"You'll have to, whether you want to or not,\" went on the alligator. \"If  you don't come down, I'll take my scaly, naily tail, and I'll saw down the  tree, and then you'll fall.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"What shall I do?\"    Then he happened to think of the bottle of toothache medicine that he held  in his hand, and, taking out the cork, he dropped the bottle, medicine and  all, right into the open mouth of the alligator, who was again up on his  tail.    And the alligator thought it was Uncle Wiggily falling into his jaws, and  he shut them quickly like a steel trap and chewed on that bottle of hot  toothache drops before he knew what it was.    Well, you can just imagine what happened. The medicine was as hot as  pepper and mustard and vinegar and cloves and horse radish all made into  one! My! how it did burn that alligator's mouth.    \"Oh my! I'm shot! I'm poisoned! I'm bitten by a mosquito! I'm stabbed! I'm  all scrambled up\" cried the alligator. \"Water, water, quick! I must have  water!\"    Then he gave a big jump, and, with his kinkery-scalery tail, he leaped  into a big puddle of water, and went away down in under, out of sight, to  cool off his mouth.    \"Oh, now is my chance! If I could only get down out of the tree!\"  exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"But with my rheumatism I'm afraid I'll fall. Oh  dear! What shall I do?\"    \"Don't be afraid, I'll help you!\" exclaimed a kind voice, and then the  voice went on: \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\" and Uncle Wiggily, looking up, saw a big  black crow perched on a limb over his head.    \"Oh, how do you do!\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, making a bow as well as he  could. \"Can you really help me down?'    \"Yes,\" said the crow, \"I can. Wait until I get my market basket. I was  just going to the grocery, but I'm in no hurry. I'll save you first.\"    So that crow flew off, and in a moment he came back with a big basket in  its bill.    \"Hop in!\" the black crow called to Uncle Wiggily, \"and I'll fly down to  the ground with you, and you can run off before the alligator comes out of  the water. I saw what you did to him with those toothache drops, and it  served him right. Come on, hop in the basket.\"    So Uncle Wiggily got in the basket, and the crow, taking the handle in his  strong beak, flew safely to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#2)"],[1,"ethnic mingling--Cultural modification during  migration--The transit land--War as form of historical  movement--Slavery--Military colonies--Withdrawal and flight--Natural  regions of asylum--Emigration and colonization--Commerce as a form of  historical movement--Movements due to religion--Historical movement and  race distribution--Zonal distribution--Movements to like or better  geographic conditions--Their direction--Return movements--Regions of  attraction and repulsion--Psychical influences in certain movements--Two  results of historical movement--Differentiation and  area--Differentiation and isolation--Geographic conditions of  heterogeneity and homogeneity--Assimilation--Elimination of unfit  variants through historical movement--Geographical origins.
