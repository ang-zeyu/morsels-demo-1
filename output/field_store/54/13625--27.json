This knowledge could rarely be obtained sufficiently through travel  and observation. There arose the new need for the systematic teaching  of geography. What had hitherto not been a human necessity and  therefore not an educational essential became both because of changed  social conditions.    Looking at education from this social point of view it is easy to see  that there was a time when no particular need existed for history,  drawing, science, vocational studies, civics, etc., beyond what one  could acquire by mingling with one's associates in the community.  These were therefore not then essentials for education. It is just  as easy to see that changed social conditions of the present make  necessary for every one a fuller and more systematic range of ideas in  each of these fields than one can pick up incidentally. These things  have thereby become educational essentials. Whether a thing today is  an educational \"essential\" or not seems to depend upon two things:  whether it is a human necessity today; and whether it is so complex  or inaccessible as to require systematic teaching. The number of  \"essentials\" changes from generation to generation. Those today who  proclaim the Three R's as the sole \"essentials\" appear to be calling  from out the rather distant past. Many things have since become  essential; and other things are being added year by year. The normal  method of education in things not yet put into the schools, is  participation in those things. One gets his ideas from watching others  and then learns to do by doing. There is no reason to believe that as  the school lends its help to some of the more difficult things, this  normal plan of learning can be set aside and another substituted. Of  course the schools must take in hand the difficult portions of the  process. Where complicated knowledge is needed, the schools must teach  that knowledge. Where drill is required, they must give the drill. But  the knowledge and the drill should be given in their relation to the  human activities in which they are used. As the school helps young  people to take on the nature of adulthood, it will still do so by  helping them to enter adequately into the activities of adulthood.  Youth will learn to think, to judge, and to do, by thinking, judging,  and doing. They will acquire a sense of responsibility by bearing  responsibility. They will take on serious forms of thought by doing  the serious things which require serious thought.    It cannot be urged that young people have a life of their own which is  to be lived only for youth's sake and without reference to the adult  world about them. As a matter of fact children and youth are a part  of the total community of which the mature adults are the natural  and responsible leaders. At an early age they begin to perform  adult activities, to take on adult points of view, to bear adult  responsibilities. Naturally it is done in ways appropriate to  their natures. At first it is imitative play, constructive play,  etc.--nature's method of bringing children to observe the serious  world about them, and to gird themselves for entering into it.  The next stage, if normal opportunities are provided, is playful  participation in the activities of their elders. This changes  gradually into serious participation as they grow older, becoming at  the end of the process responsible adult action. It is not possible  to determine the educational materials and processes at any stage of  growth without looking at the same time to that entire world of which  youth forms a part, and in which the nature and abilities of their  elders point the goal of their training.    The social point of view herein expressed is sometimes characterized  as being utilitarian. It may be so; but not in any narrow or  undesirable sense. It demands that training be as wide as life itself.  It looks to human activities of every type: religious activities;  civic activities; the duties of one's calling; one's family duties;  one's recreations; one's reading and meditation; and the rest of the  things that are done by the complete man or woman.          READING AND LITERATURE      The amount of time given to reading in the elementary schools of  Cleveland, and the average time in 50 other cities[A] are shown in the  following table:      TABLE 1.--TIME GIVEN TO READING AND LITERATURE    ========================================================           |    Hours per year     | Per cent of grade time           |-----------------------|------------------------     Grade | Cleveland | 50 cities | Cleveland | 50 cities    --------------------------------------------------------       1   |    317    |    266    |     43    |     31       2   |    317    |    235    |     36    |     26       3   |    279    |    188    |     32    |     21       4   |    196    |    153    |     22    |     16       5   |    161    |    126    |     18    |     13       6   |    136    |    117    |     15    |     12       7   |    152    |     98    |     17    |     10       8   |    152    |     97    |     17    |     10    ========================================================     Total |   1710    |   1280    |     25    |     17    --------------------------------------------------------    During the course of his school life, each pupil who finishes the  elementary grades in Cleveland receives 1710 hours of recitation  and directed study in reading as against an average of 1280 hours in  progressive cities in general. This is an excess of 430 hours, or 34  per cent. The annual cost of teaching reading being about $600,000,  this represents an excess annual investment in this subject of  some $150,000. Whether or not this excess investment in reading is  justified depends, of course, upon the way the time is used. If the  city is aiming only at the usual mastery of the mechanics of reading  and the usual introductory acquaintance with simple works of literary  art, it appears that Cleveland is using more time and labor than other  cities consider needful. If, on the other hand, this city is using  the excess time for widely diversified reading chosen for its content  value in revealing the great fields of history, industry, applied  science, manners and customs in other lands, travel, exploration,  inventions, biography, etc., and in fixing life-long habits of  intelligent reading, then it is possible that it is just this  excess time that produces the largest educational returns upon the  investment.    [Footnote A: Henry W. Holmes, \"Time Distribution by Subjects and  Grades in Representative Cities.\" In the Fourteenth Year Book of the  National Society for the Study of Education, Part I, 1915. University  of Chicago Press.]    It would seem, however, from a careful study of the actual work and  an examination of the printed documents, that the chief purpose of  teaching reading in this city is, to use the terminology of its latest  manual, \"easy expressive oral reading in rich, well-modulated tone.\"  It is true that other aims are mentioned, such as enlargement of  vocabulary, word-study, understanding of expressions and allusions,  acquaintance with the leading authors, appreciation of \"beautiful  expressions,\" etc. Properly emphasized, each of these purposes is  valid; but there are other equally valid ends to be achieved through  proper choice of the reading-content that are not mentioned. There is  here no criticism of the purposes long accepted, but of the apparent  failure to recognize other equally important ones. The character of  the reading-content is referred to only in the recommendation that  in certain grades it should relate to the seasons and to special  occasions. Even in reference to the supplementary reading, where  content should be the first concern, the only statement of purpose  is that \"children should read for the joy of it.\" Unfortunately, this  mistaken emphasis is not at all uncommon among the schools of the  nation. How one reads has received an undue amount of attention; what  one reads in the school courses must and will receive an increasingly  large share of time and thought, in the new evaluation. The use of  interesting and valuable books for other educational purposes at the  same time that they are used for drill in the mechanics of reading  is coming more and more to be recognized as an improved mode of  procedure. The mechanical side of reading is not thereby neglected. It  is given its proper function and relation, and can therefore be better  taught.    So far as one can see, Cleveland is attempting in the reading work  little more than the traditional thing. The thirty-four per cent  excess time may be justified by the city on the theory that the  schools are commissioned to get the work done one-third better than in  the average city. The reading tests made by the Survey fail to reveal  any such superiority. The city appears to be getting no better than  average results.    Certainly people should read well and effectively in all ways in which  they will be called upon to read in their adult affairs. For the most  part this means reading for ideas, suggestions, and information in  connection with the things involved in their several callings; in  connection with their civic problems; for recreation; and for such  general social enlightenment as comes from newspapers, magazines, and  books. Most reading will be for the content. It is desirable that the  reading be easy and rapid, and that one gather in all the ideas as one  reads. Because of the fact that oral reading is slower, more laborious  for both reader and listener, and because of the present easy  accessibility of printed matter, oral reading is becoming of steadily  diminishing importance to adults. No longer should the central  educational purpose be the development of expressive oral reading.  It should be rapid and effective silent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#2)"],[1,"thousand years ago, we see the names of Saxons, Goths,  Danes, and Frisians marked on the lands around the Baltic Sea. Those  who bore these names were the makers of the tale of Sigurd. The name  of the Saxons is, of course, the best known to us, and next in  importance come the people we call Danes, or Northmen, or Vikings, who  attacked the coasts of the Saxon kingdoms in England. The Saxons came  from part of the land that is now known as Germany, and the Vikings  from Denmark and from Scandinavia.    A third important tribe was that of the Goths, who dwelt first in  South Sweden, and then in Germany.    All these people resembled one another in their way of life, in their  religion, and in their ideas of what deeds were good and what were  evil. Their lands were barren--too mountainous or too cold to bring  forth fruitful crops, and their homes were not such as would tempt men  never to leave them. So, though they built their little groups of  wooden houses in the valleys of their lands, and made fields and  pastures about them, these were often left to the care of the women  and the feeble men, while the strong men made raids over the sea to  other countries, where they engaged in the fighting which they loved,  and whence they brought back plunder to their homes. North, South,  East, and West they went, till few parts of Europe had not learnt to  know and fear them.    Their ships were long and narrow, driven often by oars as well as  sails, and outside them, along the bulwarks, the crew hung their round  shields made of yellow wood from the lime-tree. The men wore byrnies  or breast-plates, and helmets, and they were armed with swords, long  spears, or heavy battle-axes. They were enemies none could afford to  despise, for they had great stature and strength of body, joined to  such fierceness and delight in war that they held a man disgraced if  he died peacefully at home. Moreover, they knew nothing of mercy to  the conquered.    Courage, not only to fight, but also to bear suffering without  impatience or complaint, and the virtue of faithfulness were the  qualities they most honoured. To be wanting in courage was disgraceful  in their eyes, but it was equally disgraceful to refuse to help  kinsfolk, to lie, to deceive, or to desert a chief.    If they put their enemies to death with fearful tortures, they did not  treat them more severely than the traitors they discovered among  themselves, and if they had no pity for those they conquered, yet they  knew well how to admire great leaders, and how to serve them  faithfully. But we can best realise their ideas on these matters by  considering their religion and their stories.    They worshipped one chief god, Odin, and other gods and goddesses who  were his children. Odin was often called All-father because he was the  helper and friend of human beings, and appeared on earth in the form  of an old man, \"one-eyed and seeming ancient,\" with cloud-blue hood  and grey cloak. He had courage, strength, and wondrous wisdom, for he  knew all events that happened in the world, and he understood the  speech of birds, and all kinds of charms and magic arts. Men served  him by brave fighting in a good cause, and when they perished in  battle he received their souls in his dwelling of Valhalla in the city  of Asgard, where they spent each day in warfare, and where at evening  the dead were revived, the wounded healed, and all feasted together in  Odin's palace. There they fed upon the flesh of the boar Saehrimner,  which was renewed as fast as it was eaten. Certain maidens called  Valkyrie, or Choosers of the Slain, were Odin's messengers whom he  sent forth into the battles of the world to find the warriors whom he  had appointed to die, and to bring them to Valhalla.    In the story of Sigurd Odin has a very important part to play, but  for the understanding of the tale it is necessary to know something  about another of the gods. This is Loki, who, though sprung from the  race of the giants, yet lived with the sons of Odin in Asgard,  behaving sometimes as their trusty helper, but more often as their  cunning enemy. He caused much wretchedness, not only among the gods,  but on earth also, for he delighted in the sight of misery. His vices  were all those most hateful to the Norse people, for he was before  all things a liar, a deceiver, a faith-breaker, a skilful worker of  mischief by guile instead of by fair fight. There are many stories of  his cunning thefts, of the miseries he wrought among his companions,  and of his envy of the beloved god Balder, whom he slew by a trick.  His children were terrible monsters, as hated as himself. Yet,  strange to say, Loki was Odin's companion in many of his adventures.    The gods inhabited Asgard, a city standing on a high mountain in the  middle of the world. Odin's palace of Valhalla was there, and other  palaces for his sons and daughters. All round Asgard lay Midgard, or  the ordinary world of men and women. Its caves and waste places were  inhabited by dwarfs, whom Odin had banished from the light of day for  various ill deeds. They were a spiteful and cunning race, jealous of  mankind, and eager to recover their lost power. Their strength lay in  their wondrous skill in handicraft, for they could forge more deadly  weapons, and fashion more lovely jewels than any made by the hands of  men. But, though possessed of wisdom, they had no spirit of kindness,  no respect for right, and no dislike of wrong.    Around Midgard lay the sea, and beyond that Utgard, a hideous frozen  country inhabited by giants, enemies of the gods.    But this arrangement of the world was only for a season. The gods  themselves looked forward to a time of defeat and death, when Asgard  should perish in flames and the world with it, and the sun and moon  should be darkened, and they themselves should be slain. This great  day was called Ragnarok, or sometimes the Twilight of the Gods. Then  Loki would gather giants and monsters to a great battle against the  gods, who would slay their enemies, but who would themselves fall in  the struggle. The sea would drown the earth, the stars would fall,  and all things would pass away.    This terrible fate the gods awaited with calm and cheerfulness,  showing even greater courage than in their many deeds of war. They  had to submit to this fate, for there were three beings even greater  than they. These were the Norns, deciders of the fate of gods and men  alike. They were three giant maidens who dwelt by a sacred,  wisdom-giving fountain, and who controlled the lives of men, giving  to each sickness and health, success and failure and death when they  would. No man or god might escape what the Norns decreed for him.    Many stories of these gods, together with tales of famous men, were  told among the northern peoples. These stories were passed on from  one to another by word of mouth, till they grew much longer and  fuller, and the happening of certain historical events helped to take  them from country to country.    As we have seen, all the races of the North were warlike and eager  for adventure, and so when trouble came upon them in their own homes,  they readily took to the sea to plunder the coasts or to conquer  other lands. Between 800 and 900 A.D., when the Danes were invading  England, many were driven from Norway because they refused to submit  to a king called Harold Fairhair, and when he pursued them to the  Orkney and Faroe Islands they took refuge on the coasts of Iceland.  There they settled, built themselves wooden houses, planted such  crops as would grow in that bleak land, and founded a commonwealth.  Little by little they left the old Viking life, and it lived only in  their songs and stories.    They had come to Iceland with a vast stock of tales in poetry, which  were related or sung by professional poets, called skalds, at all  kinds of feasts and gatherings. The skalds arranged and improved the  old stories, but they were not written down until about the time of  our King Stephen, when some unknown writer collected them into one  book called the Elder Edda. Very soon after this another book was  written containing the same stories in prose and called the Younger  or Prose Edda. In this way many of the old poems, and a great many  stories containing much information about the religion which the  people took with them to Iceland, have been preserved.    But it was from neither of the Eddas that William Morris took his  story of Sigurd.    All through the period from 800 A.D. till about the time of Henry III.  of England, the skalds had been re-telling many of the poetic stories  in prose, and as the people grew more civilised, one tale after  another was written down in its new form.    These prose tales were called Sagas, and among the very greatest is  the Volsunga Saga, or Story of Sigurd. It is a tale which has been  told in other lands besides Iceland. We read part of the same story  in the Old English poem of Beowulf, and in Germany it was made into  a great poem called the Nibelungenlied. The German musician, Richard  Wagner, set it to music in a famous series of operas called the  Nibelungen Ring. But his tale differs in many points from that  contained in Morris's poem, for Morris chose the old saga as it was  written in Iceland, not the German story. On this he founded his poem,  adding much beautiful description, and greatly lengthening the whole.    The story deals first with a certain King Volsung, to whose son,  Sigmund, Odin presented a magic sword.    But Siggeir, the jealous king of the Goths, slew Volsung, and took  Sigmund prisoner that he might have the sword for himself. Only after  many toils and perils did Sigmund win it back and reign in his  father's kingdom. At last in his old age he fell in battle and the  sword of Odin was shattered. But his wife, Queen Hiordis, kept the  fragments for the son who was born to her soon after in Denmark,  whither"]]]
