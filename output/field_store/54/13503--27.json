Godwin, then, was justified in declaring that his book comprehended \"a  general view of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by which  man becomes the destroyer of man.\" Such were the words of the original  preface, which was suppressed for a short time owing to the fears caused  by the trial of Horne Tooke, Thomas Holcroft and other revolutionists,  with whom Godwin was in profound sympathy. Had he intended \"Caleb  Williams,\" however, from its first inception, to be an imaginative  version of the \"Political Justice,\" he would have had to invent a  different plan and different characters. The arguments of a sociological  novel lack cogency unless the characters are fairly representative of  average mankind. Godwin's principal actors are both, to say the least,  exceptional. They are lofty idealizations of certain virtues and powers  of mind. Falkland is like Jean Valjean, a superhuman creature; and,  indeed, \"Caleb Williams\" may well be compared on one side with \"Les  Miserables,\" for Victor Hugo's avowed purpose, likewise, was the  denunciation of social tyranny. But the characteristics that would have  weakened the implied theorem, had such been the main object, are the  very things that make the novel more powerful as drama of a grandiose,  spiritual kind. The high and concentrated imagination that created such  a being as Falkland, and the intensity of passion with which Caleb's  fatal energy of mind is sustained through that long, despairing  struggle, are of greater artistic value than the mechanical symmetry by  which morals are illustrated.    E. A. B.          PREFACE    BY THE AUTHOR.      The following narrative is intended to answer a purpose more general and  important than immediately appears upon the face of it. The question now  afloat in the world respecting THINGS AS THEY ARE is the most  interesting that can be presented to the human mind. While one party  pleads for reformation and change, the other extols in the warmest terms  the existing constitution of society. It seemed as if something would be  gained for the decision of this question if that constitution were  faithfully developed in its practical effects. What is now presented to  the public is no refined and abstract speculation; it is a study and  delineation of things passing in the moral world. It is but of late that  the inestimable importance of political principles has been adequately  apprehended. It is now known to philosophers that the spirit and  character of the Government intrudes itself into every rank of society.  But this is a truth highly worthy to be communicated to persons whom  books of philosophy and science are never likely to reach. Accordingly,  it was proposed, in the invention of the following work, to comprehend,  as far as the progressive nature of a single story would allow, a  general review of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by  which man becomes the destroyer of man. If the author shall have taught  a valuable lesson, without subtracting from the interest and passion by  which a performance of this sort ought to be characterised, he will have  reason to congratulate himself upon the vehicle he has chosen.    _May_ 12, 1794.    This preface was withdrawn in the original edition, in compliance with  the alarms of booksellers. \"Caleb Williams\" made his first appearance in  the world in the same month in which the sanguinary plot broke out  against the liberties of Englishmen, which was happily terminated by the  acquittal of its first intended victims in the close of that year.  Terror was the order of the day; and it was feared that even the humble  novelist might be shown to be constructively a traitor.    _October_ 29, 1795.          AUTHOR'S LATEST PREFACE.      LONDON,    _November_ 20, 1832.    \"CALEB WILLIAMS\" has always been regarded by the public with an unusual  degree of favour. The proprietor of \"THE STANDARD NOVELS\" has therefore  imagined that even an account of the concoction and mode of writing of  the work would be viewed with some interest.    I finished the \"Enquiry concerning Political Justice,\" the first work  which may be considered as written by me in a certain degree in the  maturity of my intellectual powers, and bearing my name, early in  January, 1793; and about the middle of the following month the book was  published. It was my fortune at that time to be obliged to consider my  pen as the sole instrument for supplying my current expenses. By the  liberality of my bookseller, Mr. George Robinson, of Paternoster Row, I  was enabled then, and for nearly ten years before, to meet these  expenses, while writing different things of obscure note, the names of  which, though innocent and in some degree useful, I am rather inclined  to suppress. In May, 1791, I projected this, my favourite work, and from  that time gave up every other occupation that might interfere with it.  My agreement with Robinson was that he was to supply my wants at a  specified rate while the book was in the train of composition. Finally,  I was very little beforehand with the world on the day of its  publication, and was therefore obliged to look round and consider to  what species of industry I should next devote myself.    I had always felt in myself some vocation towards the composition of a  narrative of fictitious adventure; and among the things of obscure note  which I have above referred to were two or three pieces of this nature.  It is not therefore extraordinary that some project of the sort should  have suggested itself on the present occasion.    But I stood now in a very different situation from that in which I had  been placed at a former period. In past years, and even almost from  boyhood, I was perpetually prone to exclaim with Cowley:      \"What shall I do to be for ever known,    And make the age to come my own?\"    But I had endeavoured for ten years, and was as far from approaching my  object as ever. Everything I wrote fell dead-born from the press. Very  often I was disposed to quit the enterprise in despair. But still I felt  ever and anon impelled to repeat my effort.    At length I conceived the plan of Political Justice. I was convinced  that my object of building to myself a name would never be attained by  merely repeating and refining a little upon what other men had said,  even though I should imagine that I delivered things of this sort with a  more than usual point and elegance. The world, I believed, would accept  nothing from me with distinguishing favour that did not bear upon the  face of it the undoubted stamp of originality. Having long ruminated  upon the principles of Political Justice, I persuaded myself that I  could offer to the public, in a treatise on this subject, things at once  new, true, and important. In the progress of the work I became more  sanguine and confident. I talked over my ideas with a few familiar  friends during its progress, and they gave me every generous  encouragement. It happened that the fame of my book, in some  inconsiderable degree, got before its publication, and a certain number  of persons were prepared to receive it with favour. It would be false  modesty in me to say that its acceptance, when published, did not nearly  come up to everything that could soberly have been expected by me. In  consequence of this, the tone of my mind, both during the period in  which I was engaged in the work and afterwards, acquired a certain  elevation, and made me now unwilling to stoop to what was insignificant.    I formed a conception of a book of fictitious adventure that should in  some way be distinguished by a very powerful interest. Pursuing this  idea, I invented first the third volume of my tale, then the second, and  last of all the first. I bent myself to the conception of a series of  adventures of flight and pursuit; the fugitive in perpetual apprehension  of being overwhelmed with the worst calamities, and the pursuer, by his  ingenuity and resources, keeping his victim in a state of the most  fearful alarm. This was the project of my third volume. I was next  called upon to conceive a dramatic and impressive situation adequate to  account for the impulse that the pursuer should feel, incessantly to  alarm and harass his victim, with an inextinguishable resolution never  to allow him the least interval of peace and security. This I  apprehended could best be effected by a secret murder, to the  investigation of which the innocent victim should be impelled by an  unconquerable spirit of curiosity. The murderer would thus have a  sufficient motive to persecute the unhappy discoverer, that he might  deprive him of peace, character, and credit, and have him for ever in  his power. This constituted the outline of my second volume.    The subject of the first volume was still to be invented. To account  for the fearful events of the third, it was necessary that the pursuer  should be invested with every advantage of fortune, with a resolution  that nothing could defeat or baffle, and with extraordinary resources of  intellect. Nor could my purpose of giving an overpowering interest to my  tale be answered without his appearing to have been originally endowed  with a mighty store of amiable dispositions and virtues, so that his  being driven to the first act of murder should be judged worthy of the  deepest regret, and should be seen in some measure to have arisen out of  his virtues themselves. It was necessary to make him, so to speak, the  tenant of an atmosphere of romance, so that every reader should feel  prompted almost to worship him for his high qualities. Here were ample  materials for a first volume.    I felt that I had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11330"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

(_For the Mirror_.)      Whether the French were first indebted to the Roman school for their  knowledge of the art of painting is a matter of some doubt; indeed, several  celebrated French writers affirm, that they first had recourse to the  Florentine and Lombard schools; while others very strenuously declare, on  the other hand, that the Venetian artists were alone resorted to, on  account of the remarkable splendour of their colouring. A late author,  however, observes, that the French do not appear to have imitated any  school whatever, but to have adopted a style peculiar to themselves, which  though perhaps not a noble one, is nevertheless pleasing. Though it is  acknowledged that the French have a particular style, (i.e. a style of  their own,) yet their progress in the arts has been exceedingly fluctuating  and uncertain, so that it is actually impossible to ascertain who was the  first reputable artist amongst them. Cousin was a painter on glass, and  certainly obtained a good reputation amongst his countrymen. But he in fact  possessed very little merit, and his name would not doubtless have been  known to posterity had he not lived in a barbarous age, when the people  knew not how to discriminate his errors and defects. He was supposed to be  the best artist of his day, and consequently gained a reputation as such,  though his works are far beneath mediocrity.    Francis I. was a great encourager of the fine arts, and the artists  themselves were liberally paid for their productions, until that king was  unfortunately taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia, in the year 1525.  After the death of Francis, the kingdom was distracted with civil wars, so  that painting was entirely neglected by his immediate successors. In the  year 1610, however, Louis XIII. recovered the arts from their languid  state. In his reign, Jaques Blanchard was the most flourishing painter;  although Francis Perier, Simon Voueet, C.A. Du Fresnoy, and Peter Mignard,  were equally gifted.    Of Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy, author of a Latin poem, entitled _De Arte  Graphica_, I shall attempt a little account. This painter was born at Paris  in the year 1611. His father, intending him for the profession of physic,  sent him to the university of Paris, where he made great progress in his  studies, and obtained several prizes in poetry. He had a great inclination  for painting as well as for poetry, and, though much against his father's  desire, resolved to leave off the study of physic, and commence that of  drawing. The force of his inclination subduing every measure adopted to  suppress it, he took every opportunity of cultivating his favourite study.  Leaving college, he placed himself under Francis Perier, from whom he  learned the art of designing. He afterwards thought fit to travel into  Italy, where he arrived in 1633. Being abandoned by his parents, who were  highly incensed at his having rejected the study of physic, he was reduced  to the utmost distress on his arrival at Rome, and was compelled to paint  trifling pieces for his daily subsistence. After two years of extreme toil  and difficulty, he was relieved by the arrival of Mignard, the artist, who  had formerly been the companion of his studies. Mignard evinced the warmest  regard for his friend, and they were afterwards known in Rome by the name  of the _inseparables_, for they lived in the same house, worked together,  and united the produce of their labours. They were employed to copy all the  best pictures in the Farnese Palace, and every evening attended an academy  of drawing. Mignard was superior in practice, while Fresnoy was perfect  master of the rules, history, and theory of his profession. They  communicated their sentiments to each other, Fresnoy furnishing his friend  with noble ideas, and the latter instructing the former to paint with more  ease and dispatch. Fresnoy painted several fine pictures in Rome, and, in  1653, he left that city, in company with his friend, travelled to Venice,  and then to Lombardy. Here the two friends parted,[3] Mignard returning to  Rome, and Fresnoy to his native city. After his arrival in Paris, he  painted some beautiful historical pictures, which established his  reputation. He perfectly understood architecture, and drew designs for many  elegant mansions in Paris. During his travels in Italy, he planned and  composed his _De Arte Graphica_, an excellent poem, full of valuable  information, and containing unerring rules for the painter. This poem was  twenty years in hand, and was not published until three years[4] after the  author's death, which took place in 1665. It has been observed, that  Fresnoy possessed the genius requisite for forming a great master; and had  he applied himself more strictly to painting, and educated pupils, he would  doubtless have proved one of the greatest painters France ever produced.  But, possessing high literary talents, he chose to lay down _precepts_ for  his countrymen, rather than to present them with _examples_ of his art. He  adhered too closely to the theory of painting, neglecting the more  essential part--practice.       [3] When Mignard returned to Paris in 1658, he again went to reside         with his friend.       [4] It appeared at Paris, in 12mo., with a French translation by         Mons. Du Piles, 1668.    In the reign of Louis XIV., Nicholas Poussin distinguished himself as a  painter, by displaying exquisite knowledge and great skill in composition.  He generally painted ancient ruins, landscapes, and historical figures. He  was likewise well acquainted with the manners and customs of the ancients;  and, though he educated no pupils, and never had any imitators, his  pictures are universally admired in every European country. Charles le  Brun[5] established the French school,--an undertaking which Voueet had  previously attempted. Le Brun drew well, had a ready conception, and a  fertile imagination. His compositions are vast, but, in various instances,  they may justly be termed _outre_. He possessed the animation, but not the  inspiration of Raphael; and his design is not so pure as that of  Domenichino, nor so lively as that of Annibale Caracci. Eustache le Seur,  Le Brun's rival, possessed remarkable dignity, and wonderful correctness of  style. Indeed, by some he has been called the Raphael of France. Had he  lived longer, (for he died at the age of thirty-eight,) the French school,  under his direction, would most probably have adopted a manner which might  have been imitated, and which might have established the arts on an  eminence to vie with even imperial Rome. But, by the concurrence of  extraordinary circumstances, Le Brun was the fashionable painter of the  time, and it therefore became necessary to imitate _his_ manner, rather  than the more simple and more refined one of his rival. As Le Brun's  imitators wanted his genius, his faults not only became current, but more  glaring and deformed.        [5] Le Brun was the pupil of Simon Voueet, and afterwards of Poussin.    After Le Brun's death, which took place in 1690, the French artists  degenerated greatly, their productions being decorated in a gaudy and  theatrical way, without due regard to taste or decorum. Their school, some  years ago, altered its principles, under the auspices of the spirited Count  de Caylus, who possessed considerable merit as an artist. The count, by his  high rank and fortune, had the means of encouraging the imitators of the  ancients, and of procuring the best models in Italy for study. He, in  conjunction with Monsieur Vien, first formed the design of restoring a pure  taste in France; and if his countrymen had followed the path thus marked  out for them, they would now have been equal to the greatest of the Greek  painters. But it appears that they are incapable of rising to any very  extraordinary height in the arts, for, with the exception of Le Seur, and  one or two others, they have ever wanted that elevation of mind which so  eminently distinguished the Romans. Though De Caylus greatly purified  painting in his time, yet his precepts and examples had little or no weight  after his death, for the art again retrograded into its original state--a  state from which the French professors, as before observed, seem incapable  of rising.    In our own days some few French artists have distinguished themselves,  particularly Lefevre, who was the chief painter to Napoleon. A full-length  portrait of the emperor in his coronation robes, for which Lefevre received  the sum of five thousand Napoleons, and which I have lately had the  pleasure of seeing, is very correct in drawing, and extremely rich and  harmonious in colour; but it wants freedom and boldness of execution.    To conclude--the French are acknowledged to do pretty well within the  precincts of their own country, though few of their pictures will stand in  competition with those of the Italians, or with those produced in our own  school.
