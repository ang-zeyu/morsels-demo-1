These sounds have been compared to clicking and clapping, and  according to Sayce, these clickings and clappings survive as though to show  us how man when deprived of speech can fix and transmit his thoughts by  certain sounds. These mixed states represent articulate speech in its  primordial state; they represent the stage of transition from pure  pantomime to articulate speech.    It seems, then, that originally man had two languages at his disposal which  he used simultaneously or interchangeably. They supported each other in the  intercommunication of ideas, but speech has triumphed because of its  greater practical utility. The language of gesture is disadvantageous for  the following reasons: (1) it monopolises the use of the hands; (2) it has  the disadvantage that it does not carry any distance; (3) it is useless in  the dark; (4) it is vague in character; (5) it is imitative in nature and  permits only of the intercommunication of ideas based upon concrete images.  Speech, on the other hand, is transmitted in the dark and with objects  intervening; moreover, distance affects its transmission much less. The  images of auditory and visual symbols in the growth of speech replace in  our minds concrete images and they permit of abstract thought. It is  dependent primarily upon the ear, an organ of exquisite feeling, whose  sensations are infinite in number and in kind. This sensory receptor with  its cerebral perceptor has in the long process of time, aided by vision,  under the influence of natural laws of the survival of the fittest,  educated and developed an instrument of simple construction (primarily  adapted only for the vegetative functions of life and simple vocalisation)  into that wonderful instrument the human voice; but by that development,  borrowing the words of Huxley, \"man has slowly accumulated and organised  the experience which is almost wholly lost with the cessation of every  individual life in other animals; so that now he stands raised as upon a  mountain-top, far above the level of his humble fellows, and transfigured  from his grosser nature by reflecting here and there a ray from the  infinite source of truth.\" Thought in all the higher mental processes could  not be carried on at all without the aid of language.    Written language probably originated in an analytical process analogous to  the language of gesture. Like that, it: (1) isolates terms; (2) arranges  them in a certain order; (3) translates thoughts in a crude and somewhat  vague form. A curious example of this may be found in Max Mueller's \"Chips  from a German Workshop,\" XIV.: \"The aborigines of the Caroline Islands sent  a letter to a Spanish captain as follows: A man with extended arms, sign of  greeting; below to the left, the objects they have to barter--five big  shells, seven little ones, three others of different forms; to the right,  drawing of the objects they wanted in exchange--three large fish-hooks,  four small ones, two axes, two pieces of iron.\"    Language of graphic signs and spoken language have progressed together, and  simultaneously supported each other in the development of the higher mental  faculties that differentiate the savage from the brute and the civilised  human being from the savage. In spoken language, at any rate, it is not the  vocal instrument that has been changed, but the organ of mind with its  innate and invisible molecular potentialities, the result of racial and  ancestral experiences in past ages. Completely developed languages when  studied from the point of view of their evolution are stamped with the  print of an unconscious labour that has been fashioning them for centuries.  A little consideration and reflection upon words which have been coined in  our own time shows that language offers an abstract and brief chronicle of  social psychology.    Articulate language has converted the vocal instrument into the chief agent  of the will, but the brain in the process of time has developed by the  movements of the lips, tongue, jaw, and soft palate a kinaesthetic[A] sense  of articulate speech, which has been integrated and associated in the mind  with rhythmical modulated sounds conveyed to the brain by the auditory  nerves. There has thus been a reciprocal simultaneity in the development of  these two senses by which the mental ideas of spoken words are memorised  and recalled. Had man been limited to articulate speech he could not have  made the immense progress he has made in the development of complex mental  processes, for language, by using written verbal symbols, has allowed, not  merely the transmission of thought from one individual to another, but the  thoughts of the world, past and present, are in a certain measure at the  disposal of every individual. With this introduction to the subject I will  pass on to give a detailed description of the instrument of the voice.    [Footnote A: Sense of movement.]          THE VOCAL INSTRUMENT      A distinction is generally made in physics between sound and noise. Noise  affects our tympanic membrane as an irregular succession of shocks and we  are conscious of a jarring of the auditory apparatus; whereas a musical  sound is smooth and pleasant because the tympanic membrane is thrown into  successive periodic vibrations to which the auditory receptor (sense organ  of hearing) has been attuned. To produce musical sounds, a body must  vibrate with the regularity of a pendulum, but it must be capable of  imparting sharper or quicker shocks to the air than the pendulum. All  musical sounds, however they are produced and by whatever means they are  propagated, may be distinguished by three different qualities:    (1) Loudness, (2) Pitch, (3) Quality, timbre or klang, as the Germans call  it.    Loudness depends upon the amount of energy expended in producing the sound.  If I rub a tuning-fork with a well-rosined bow, I set it in vibration by  the resistance offered to the rosined hair; and if while it is vibrating I  again apply the bow, thus expending more energy, the note produced is  louder. Repeating the action several times, the width of excursion of the  prongs of the tuning-fork is increased. This I can demonstrate, not merely  by the loudness of the sound which can be heard, but by sight; for if a  small mirror be fixed on one of the prongs and a beam of light be cast upon  the mirror, the light being again reflected on to the screen, you will see  the spot of light dance up and down, and the more energetically the  tuning-fork is bowed the greater is the amplitude of the oscillation of the  spot of light. The duration of the time occupied is the same in traversing  a longer as in traversing a shorter space, as is the case of the swinging  pendulum. The vibrating prongs of the tuning-fork throw the air into  vibrations which are conveyed to the ear and produce the sensation of  sound. The duration of time occupied in the vibrations of the tuning-fork  is therefore independent of the space passed over. The greater or less  energy expended does not influence the duration of time occupied by the  vibration; it only influences the amplitude of the vibration.    The second quality of musical sounds is the pitch, and the pitch depends  upon the number of vibrations that a sounding body makes in each second of  time. The most unmusical ear can distinguish a high note from a low one,  even when the interval is not great. Low notes are characterised by a  relatively small number of vibrations, and as the pitch rises so the number  of vibrations increase. This can be proved in many ways. Take, for example,  two tuning-forks of different size: the shorter produces a considerably  higher pitched note than the longer one. If a mirror be attached to one of  the prongs of each fork, and a beam of light be cast upon each mirror  successively and then reflected in a revolving mirror, the oscillating spot  of light is converted into a series of waves; and if the waves obtained by  reflecting the light from the mirror of the smaller one be counted and  compared with those reflected from the mirror attached to the larger fork,  it will be found that the number of waves reflected from the smaller fork  is proportionally to the difference in the pitch more numerous than the  waves reflected from the larger. The air is thrown into corresponding  periodic vibrations according to the rate of vibration of the  sound-producing body.    Thirdly, the quality, timbre, or klang depends upon the overtones, in  respect to which I could cite many experiments to prove that whenever a  body vibrates, other bodies near it may be set in vibration, but only on  condition that such bodies shall be capable themselves of producing the  same note. A number of different forms of resonators can be used to  illustrate this law; a law indeed which is of the greatest importance in  connection with the mechanism of the human voice. Although notes are of the  same loudness and pitch when played on different instruments or spoken or  sung by different individuals, yet even a person with no ear for music can  easily detect a difference in the quality of the sound and is able to  recognise the nature of the instrument or the timbre of the voice. This  difference in the timbre is due to harmonics or overtones. Could we but see  the sonorous waves in the air during the transmission of the sound of a  voice, we should see stamped on it the conditions of motion upon which its  characteristic qualities depended; which is due to the fact that every  vocal sound whose vibrations have a complex form can be decomposed into a  series of simple notes all belonging to the harmonic series. These  harmonics or overtones will be considered later when dealing with the  timbre or quality of the human voice.    The vocal instrument is unlike any other musical instrument; it most nearly  approaches a reed instrument. The clarionet"]]]
