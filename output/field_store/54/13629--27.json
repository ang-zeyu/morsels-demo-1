One of Aunt Sarah's special economies was the saving of twine and  paper bags. The latter were always neatly folded, when emptied, and  placed in a cretonne bag made for that purpose, hanging in a  convenient corner of the kitchen.    Aunt Sarah's gingham apron was replaced afternoons by one made from  fine, Lonsdale cambric, of ample proportions, and on special occasions  she donned a hemstitched linen apron, inset at upper edge of hem with  crocheted lace insertion, the work of her own deft fingers. Aunt  Sarah's aprons, cut straight, on generous lines, were a part of her  individuality.    Sarah Landis declared: \"Happiness consists in giving and in serving  others,\" and she lived up to the principles she advocated. She  frequently quoted from the \"Sons of Martha,\" by Kipling:      \"Lift ye the stone or cleave the wood, to make a path more fair or flat,    Not as a ladder from earth to heaven, not as an altar to any creed,    But simple service, simply given, to his own kind in their human need.\"    \"I think this so fine,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"and so true a sentiment that  I am almost compelled to forgive Kipling for saying 'The female of the  species is more deadly than the male.'\"    Aunt Sarah's goodness was reflected in her face and in the tones of  her voice, which were soft and low, yet very decided. She possessed a  clear, sweet tone, unlike the slow, peculiar drawl often aiding with  the rising inflection peculiar to many country folk among the  \"Pennsylvania Germans.\"    The secret of Aunt Sarah's charm lay in her goodness. Being always  surrounded by a cheery atmosphere, she benefited all with whom she  came in contact. She took delight in simple pleasures. She had the  power of extracting happiness from the common, little every-day tasks  and frequently remarked, \"Don't strive to live without work, but to  find more joy in your work.\" Her opinions were highly respected by  every one in the neighborhood, and, being possessed of an unselfish  disposition, she thought and saw good in every one; brought out the  best in one, and made one long to do better, just to gain her  approval, if for no higher reward. Sarah Landis was a loyal friend and  one would think the following, by Mrs. Craik, applied to her:    \"Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort, of feeling safe with a  person--having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but  pouring them all right out, just as they are--chaff and grain  together, certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep  what is worth keeping and then with the breath of kindness blow the  rest away.\"    She was never so happy as when doing an act of kindness for some poor  unfortunate, and often said. \"If 'twere not for God and good people,  what would become of the unfortunate?\" and thought like George  McDonald, \"If I can put one touch of rosy sunset into the life of any  man or woman (I should add child) I shall feel that I have worked with  God.\"    Aunt Sarah's sweet, lovable face was the first beheld by many a  little, new-born infant; her voice, the first to hush its wailing  cries as she cuddled it up to her motherly breast, and oft, with  loving hands, softly closed the lids over eyes no longer able to see;  whom the Gracious Master had taken into His keeping.    One day I overheard Aunt Sarah quote to a sorrowing friend these fine,  true lines from Longfellow's \"Resignation\": \"Let us be patient, these  severe afflictions not from the ground arise, but celestial  benedictions assume the dark disguise.\"    [Illustration: THE OLD SPRING HOUSE]          CHAPTER II.    MARY'S ARRIVAL AT THE FARM.      The day preceding that of Mary's arrival at the farm was a busy one  for Aunt Sarah, who, since early morning, had been preparing the  dishes she knew Mary enjoyed. Pans of the whitest, flakiest rolls, a  large loaf of sweetest nut-brown, freshly-baked \"graham bread,\" of  which Mary was especially fond; an array of crumb-cakes and pies of  every description covered the well-scrubbed table in the summer  kitchen, situated a short distance from the house. A large, yellow  earthenware bowl on the table contained a roll of rich, creamy \"smier  kase\" just as it had been turned from the muslin bag, from which the  \"whey\" had dripped over night; ready to be mixed with cream for the  supper table. Pats of sweet, freshly-churned butter, buried in clover  blossoms, were cooling in the old spring-house near by.    The farm house was guiltless of dust from cellar to attic. Aunt Sarah  was a model housekeeper; she accomplished wonders, yet never appeared  tired or flurried as less systematic housekeepers often do, who, with  greater expenditure of energy, often accomplish less work. She took no  unnecessary steps; made each one count, yet never appeared in haste to  finish her work.    Said Aunt Sarah, \"The lack of system in housework is what makes it  drudgery. If young housekeepers would sit down and plan their work,  then do it, they would save time and labor. When using the fire in the  range for ironing or other purposes, use the oven for preparing dishes  of food which require long, slow cooking, like baked beans, for  instance. Bake a cake or a pudding, or a pan of quickly-made corn pone  to serve with baked beans, for a hearty meal on a cold winter day. A  dish of rice pudding placed in the oven requires very little  attention, and when baked may be placed on ice until served. If this  rule be followed, the young housewife will be surprised to find how  much easier will be the task of preparing a meal later in the day,  especially in hot weather.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The day following, John Landis drove to the railroad station, several  miles distant, to meet his niece. As Mary stepped from the train into  the outstretched arms of her waiting Uncle, many admiring glances  followed the fair, young girl. Her tan-gold naturally wavy, masses of  hair rivaled ripened grain. The sheen of it resembled corn silk before  it has been browned and crinkled by the sun. Her eyes matched in color  the exquisite, violet-blue blossoms of the chicory weed. She possessed  a rather large mouth, with upturned corners, which seemed made for  smiles, and when once you had been charmed with them, she had made an  easy conquest of you forever. There was a sweet, winning personality  about Mary which was as impossible to describe as to resist. One  wondered how so much adorable sweetness could be embodied in one small  maid. But Mary's sweetness of expression and charming manner covered a  strong will and tenacity of purpose one would scarcely have believed  possible, did they not have an intimate knowledge of the young girl's  disposition. Her laugh, infectious, full of the joy of living, the  vitality of youth and perfect health and happiness, reminded one of  the lines: \"A laugh is just like music for making living sweet.\"    Seated beside her Uncle in the carriage, Mary was borne swiftly  through the town out into the country. It was one of those  preternaturally quiet, sultry days when the whole universe appears  lifeless and inert, free from loud noise, or sound of any description,  days which we occasionally have in early Spring or Summer, when the  stillness is oppressive.    Frequently at such times there is borne to the nostrils the faint,  stifling scent of burning brush, indicating that land is being cleared  by the forehanded, thrifty farmer for early planting. Often at such  times, before a shower, may be distinctly heard the faintest twitter  and \"peep, peep\" of young sparrows, the harsh \"caw, caw\" of the crow,  and the song of the bobolink, poised on the swaying branch of a tall  tree, the happiest bird of Spring; the dozy, drowsy hum of bees; the  answering call of lusty young chanticleers, and the satisfied cackle  of laying hens and motherly old biddies, surrounded by broods of  downy, greedy little newly-hatched chicks. The shrill whistle of a  distant locomotive startles one with its clear, resonant intonation,  which on a less quiet day would pass unnoticed. Mary, with the zest of  youth, enjoyed to the full the change from the past months of  confinement in a city school, and missed nothing of the beauty of the  country and the smell of the good brown earth, as her Uncle drove  swiftly homeward.    \"Uncle John,\" said Mary, \"'tis easy to believe God made the country.\"    \"Yes,\" rejoined her Uncle, \"the country is good enough for me.\"    \"With the exception of the one day in the month, when you attend the  'Shriners' meeting' in the city,\" mischievously supplemented Mary, who  knew her Uncle's liking for the Masonic Lodge of which he was a  member, \"and,\" she continued, \"I brought you a picture for your  birthday, which we shall celebrate tomorrow. The picture will please  you, I know. It is entitled, 'I Love to Love a Mason, 'Cause a Mason  Never Tells.'\"    They passed cultivated farms. Inside many of the rail fences,  inclosing fields of grain or clover, were planted numberless sour  cherry trees, snowy with bloom, the ground underneath white with  fallen petals. The air was sweet with the perfume of the half-opened  buds on the apple trees in the near-by orchards and rose-like pink  blossoms of the \"flowering\" crab-apple, in the door yards. Swiftly  they drove through cool, green, leafy woods, crossing a wooden bridge  spanning a small stream, so shallow that the stones at the bottom were  plainly to be seen. A loud splash, as the sound of carriage wheels  broke the uninterrupted silence, and a commotion in the water gave  evidence of the sudden disappearance of several green-backed frogs,  sunning themselves on a large, moss-grown rock, projecting above the  water's edge; from shady nooks and crevices peeped clusters of early  white violets; graceful maidenhair ferns, and hardier members of the  fern family, called \"Brake,\" uncurled their graceful, sturdy fronds  from the carpet of green moss and lichen at the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#2)"],[1,"nurture and honourable descent,  are at once plunged into all the hardships attendant on the rough life  of a bush-settler. The laws that regulate the grants of lands, which  enforce a certain time of residence, and certain settlement duties to be  performed, allow no claims to absentees when once the land is drawn.  These laws wisely force a superiorly-educated man with resources of both  property and intellect, to devote all his energies to a certain spot of  uncleared land. It may easily be supposed that no persons would  encounter these hardships who have not a young family to establish in  the healthful ways of independence. This family renders the residence of  such a head still more valuable to the colony; and the half-pay officer,  by thus leading the advanced guard of civilization, and bringing into  these rough districts gentle and well-educated females, who soften and  improve all around them by _mental_ refinements, is serving his country  as much by founding peaceful villages and pleasant homesteads in the  trackless wilds, as ever he did by personal courage, or military  stratagem, in times of war.    It will be seen, in the course of this work, that the writer is as  earnest in recommending ladies who belong to the higher class of  settlers to cultivate all the mental resources of a superior education,  as she is to induce them to discard all irrational and artificial wants  and mere useless pursuits. She would willingly direct their attention to  the natural history and botany of this new country, in which they will  find a never-failing source of amusement and instruction, at once  enlightening and elevating the mind, and serving to fill up the void  left by the absence of those lighter feminine accomplishments, the  practice of which are necessarily superseded by imperative domestic  duties. To the person who is capable of looking abroad into the beauties  of nature, and adoring the Creator through his glorious works, are  opened stores of unmixed pleasure, which will not permit her to be dull  or unhappy in the loneliest part of our Western Wilderness. The writer  of these pages speaks from experience, and would be pleased to find that  the simple sources from which she has herself drawn pleasure, have  cheered the solitude of future female sojourners in the backwoods of  Canada.    As a general remark to all sorts and conditions of settlers, she would  observe, that the struggle up the hill of Independence is often a severe  one, and it ought not to be made alone. It must be aided and encouraged  by the example and assistance of an active and cheerful partner.  Children should be taught to appreciate the devoted love that has  induced their parents to overcome the natural reluctance felt by all  persons to quit for ever the land of their forefathers, the scenes of  their earliest and happiest days, and to become aliens and wanderers in  a distant country,--to form new ties and new friends, and begin, as it  were, life's toilsome march anew, that their children may be placed in a  situation in which, by industry and activity, the substantial comforts  of life may be permanently obtained, and a landed property handed down  to them, and their children after them.    Young men soon become reconciled to this country, which offers to them  that chief attraction to youth,--great personal liberty. Their  employments are of a cheerful and healthy nature; and their amusements,  such as hunting, shooting, fishing, and boating, are peculiarly  fascinating. But in none of these can their sisters share. The hardships  and difficulties of the settler's life, therefore, are felt peculiarly  by the female part of the family. It is with a view of ameliorating  these privations that the following pages have been written, to show how  some difficulties may be best borne and others avoided. The simple  truth, founded entirely on personal knowledge of the facts related, is  the basis of the work; to have had recourse to fiction might have  rendered it more acceptable to many readers, but would have made it less  useful to that class for whom it is especially intended. For those who,  without intending to share in the privations and dangers of an  emigrant's life, have a rational curiosity to become acquainted with  scenes and manners so different from those of a long-civilized county,  it is hoped that this little work will afford some amusement, and  inculcate some lessons not devoid of moral instruction.          LETTER I.    Departure from Greenock in the Brig. _Laurel_.--Fitting-up of the  Vessel.--Boy Passenger.--Sea Prospect.--Want of Occupation and  Amusement.--Captain's Goldfinch.    Brig. _Laurel_, July 18, 1832    I RECEIVED your last kind letter, my dearest mother, only a few hours  before we set sail from Greenock. As you express a wish that I should  give you a minute detail of our voyage, I shall take up my subject from  the time of our embarkation, and write as inclination prompts me.  Instead of having reason to complain of short letters, you will, I fear,  find mine only too prolix.    After many delays and disappointments, we succeeded at last in obtaining  a passage in a fast-sailing brig, the _Laurel_, of Greenock; and  favourable winds are now rapidly carrying us across the Atlantic.    The _Laurel_ is not a regular passenger-ship, which I consider an  advantage, for what we lose in amusement and variety we assuredly gain  in comfort. The cabin is neatly fitted up, and I enjoy the luxury (for  such it is, compared with the narrow berths of the state cabin) of a  handsome sofa, with crimson draperies, in the great cabin. The state  cabin is also ours. We paid fifteen pounds each for our passage to  Montreal. This was high, but it includes every expense; and, in fact, we  had no choice. The only vessel in the river bound for Canada, was a  passenger-ship, literally swarming with emigrants, chiefly of the lower  class of Highlanders.    The only passengers besides ourselves in the _Laurel_ are the captain's  nephew, a pretty yellow-haired lad, about fifteen years of age, who  works his passage out, and a young gentleman who is going out as clerk  in a merchant's house in Quebec. He seems too much wrapped up in his own  affairs to be very communicative to others; he walks much, talks little,  and reads less, but often amuses himself by singing as he paces the  deck, \"Home, sweet home,\" and that delightful song by Camoens, \"Isle of  beauty.\" It is a sweet song, and I can easily imagine the charm it has  for a home-sick heart.    I was much pleased with the scenery of the Clyde; the day we set sail  was a lovely one, and I remained on deck till nightfall. The morning  light found our vessel dashing gallantly along, with a favourable  breeze, through the north channel; that day we saw the last of the  Hebrides, and before night lost sight of the north coast of Ireland. A  wide expanse of water and sky is now our only prospect, unvaried by any  object save the distant and scarcely to be traced outline of some vessel  just seen at the verge of the horizon, a speck in the immensity of  space, or sometimes a few sea-fowl. I love to watch these wanderers of  the ocean, as they rise and fall with the rocking billows, or flit about  our vessel; and often I wonder whence they came, to what distant shore  they are bound, and if they make the rude wave their home and resting-  place during the long day and dark night; and then I recall to mind the  words of the American poet, Bryant,--       \"He who from zone to zone    Guides through the boundless air their certain flight,      In the long way that I must tread alone    Wilt guide my steps aright.\"    Though we have been little more than a week on board, I am getting weary  of the voyage. I can only compare the monotony of it to being weather-  bound in some country inn. I have already made myself acquainted with  all the books worth reading in the ship's library; unfortunately, it is  chiefly made up with old novels and musty romances.    When the weather is fine I sit on a bench on the deck, wrapped in my  cloak, and sew, or pace the deck with my husband, and talk over plans  for the future, which in all probability will never be realized. I  really do pity men who are not actively employed: women have always  their needle as a resource against the overwhelming weariness of an idle  life; but where a man is confined to a small space, such as the deck and  cabin of a trading vessel, with nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing  to do, and nothing to read, he is really a very pitiable creature.    There is one passenger on board that seems perfectly happy, if one may  judge from the liveliness of the songs with which he greets us whenever  we approach his cage. It is \"Harry,\" the captain's goldfinch--\"the  _captain's mate_,\" as the sailors term him. This pretty creature has  made no fewer than twelve voyages in the _Laurel_. \"It is all one to him  whether his cage is at sea or on land, he is still at home,\" said the  captain, regarding his little favourite with an air of great affection,  and evidently gratified by the attention I bestowed on his bird.    I have already formed a friendship with the little captive. He never  fails to greet my approach with one of his sweetest songs, and will take  from my fingers a bit of biscuit, which he holds in his claws till he  has thanked me with a few of his clearest notes. This mark of  acknowledgment is termed by the steward, \"saying-grace.\"    If the wind still continues to favour us, the captain tells us we shall  be on the banks of Newfoundland in another week. Farewell for the  present.
