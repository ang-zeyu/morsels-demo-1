And what, O child, is that which thou wilt do in order to live in  disguise.'    \"Sahadeva replied, 'I will become a keeper of the king of Virata's kine.  I am skilled in milking kine and taking their history as well as in  taming their fierceness. Passing under the name of Tantripala, I shall  perform my duties deftly. Let thy heart's fever be dispelled. Formerly I  was frequently employed to look after thy kine, and, O Lord of earth, I  have a particular knowledge of that work. And, O monarch, I am  well-acquainted with the nature of kine, as also with their auspicious  marks and other matters relating to them. I can also discriminate bulls  with auspicious marks, the scent of whose urine may make even the barren  being forth child. Even thus will I live, and I always take delight in  work of this kind. Indeed, no one will then be able to recognise me, and  I will moreover gratify the monarch.'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'This is our beloved wife dearer to us than our  lives. Verily, she deserveth to be cherished by us like a mother, and  regarded like an elder sister. Unacquainted as she is with any kind of  womanly work, what office will Krishna, the daughter of Drupada,  perform? Delicate and young, she is a princess of great repute. Devoted  to her lords, and eminently virtuous, also, how will she live? Since her  birth, she hath enjoyed only garlands and perfumes and ornaments and  costly robes.'    \"Draupadi replied, 'There is a class of persons called _Sairindhris_,[5]  who enter the services of other. Other females, however (that are  respectable) do not do so. Of this class there are some. I shall give  myself out as a _Sairindhri_, skilled in dressing hair. And, O Bharata,  on being questioned by the king, I shall say that I served as a waiting  woman of Draupadi in Yudhishthira's household. I shall thus pass my days  in disguise. And I shall serve the famous Sudeshna, the wife of the  king. Surely, obtaining me she will cherish me (duly). Do not grieve so,  O king.'

Chaste as thou art, and always  engaged in observing virtuous vows, thou knowest not what is sin. Do  thou, therefore, conduct thyself in such a way that sinful men of evil  hearts may not be gladdened by gazing at thee.'\"      SECTION IV    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Ye have already said what offices ye will  respectively perform. I also, according to the measure of my sense, have  said what office I will perform. Let our priest, accompanied by  charioteers and cooks, repair to the abode of Drupada, and there  maintain our _Agnihotra_ fires. And let Indrasena and the others, taking  with them the empty cars, speedily proceeded to Dwaravati. Even this is  my wish. And let all these maid-servants of Draupadi go to the  Panchalas, with our charioteers and cooks. And let all of them say,--_We  do not know where the Pandavas have gone leaving us at the lake of  Dwaitavana_.'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Having thus taken counsel of one another and told  one another the offices they would discharge, the Pandavas sought  Dhaumya's advice. And Dhaumya also gave them advice in the following  words, saying, 'Ye sons of Pandu, the arrangements ye have made  regarding the Brahmanas, your friends, cars, weapons, and the (sacred)  fires, are excellent. But it behoveth thee, O Yudhishthira, and Arjuna  specially, to make provision for the protection of Draupadi. Ye king, ye  are well-acquainted with the characters of men. Yet whatever may be your  knowledge, friends may from affection be permitted to repeat what is  already known. Even this is subservient to the eternal interests of  virtue, pleasure, and profit. I shall, therefore speak to you something.  Mark ye. To dwell with a king is, alas, difficult. I shall tell you, ye  princes, how ye may reside in the royal household, avoiding every fault.  Ye Kauravas, honourably or otherwise, ye will have to pass this year in  the king's palace, undiscovered by those that know you. Then in the  fourteenth year, ye will live happy. O son of Pandu, in this world, that  cherisher and protector of all beings, the king, who is a deity in an  embodied form, is as a great fire sanctified with all the _mantras_.[6]  One should present himself before the king, after having obtained his  permission at the gate. No one should keep contact with royal secrets.  Nor should one desire a seat which another may covet. He who doth not,  regarding himself to be a favourite, occupy (the king's) car, or coach,  or seat, or vehicle, or elephant, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal  household. He that sits not upon a seat the occupation of which is  calculated raise alarm in the minds of malicious people, is alone worthy  of dwelling in a royal household. No one should, unasked offer counsel  (to a king). Paying homage in season unto the king, one should silently  and respectfully sit beside the king, for kings take umbrage at  babblers, and disgrace lying counsellors. A wise person should not  contact friendship with the king's wife, nor with the inmates of the  inner apartments, nor with those that are objects of royal displeasure.  One about the king should do even the most unimportant acts and with the  king's knowledge. Behaving thus with a sovereign, one doth not come by  harm. Even if an individual attain the highest office, he should, as  long as he is not asked or commanded, consider himself as born-blind,  having regard to the king's dignity, for O repressers of foes, the  rulers of men do not forgive even their sons and grandsons and brothers  when they happen to tamper with their dignity. Kings should be served  with regardful care, even as Agni and other gods; and he that is  disloyal to his sovereign, is certainly destroyed by him. Renouncing  anger, and pride, and negligence, it behoveth a man to follow the course  directed by the monarch. After carefully deliberating on all things, a  person should set forth before the king those topics that are both  profitable and pleasant; but should a subject be profitable without  being pleasant, he should still communicate it, despite its  disagreeableness. It behoveth a man to be well-disposed towards the king  in all his interests, and not to indulge in speech that is alike  unpleasant and profitless. Always thinking--_I am not liked by the  king_--one should banish negligence, and be intent on bringing about  what is agreeable and advantageous to him. He that swerveth not from his  place, he that is not friendly to those that are hostile to the king, he  that striveth not to do wrong to the king, is alone worthy to dwell in a  royal household. A learned man should sit either on the king's right or  the left; he should not sit behind him for that is the place appointed  for armed guards, and to sit before him is always interdicted. Let none,  when the king is engaged in doing anything (in respect of his servants)  come forward pressing himself zealously before others, for even if the  aggrieved be very poor, such conduct would still be inexcusable.[7] It  behoveth no man to reveal to others any lie the king may have told  inasmuch as the king bears ill will to those that report his falsehoods.  Kings also always disregard persons that regard themselves as learned.  No man should be proud thinking--_I am brave, or, I am intelligent_, but  a person obtains the good graces of a king and enjoys the good things of  life, by behaving agreeably to the wishes of the king. And, O Bharata,  obtaining things agreeable, and wealth also which is so hard to acquire,  a person should always do what is profitable as well as pleasant to the  king. What man that is respected by the wise can even think of doing  mischief to one whose ire is great impediment and whose favour is  productive of mighty fruits? No one should move his lips, arms and  thighs, before the king. A person should speak and spit before the king  only mildly. In the presence of even laughable objects, a man should not  break out into loud laughter, like a maniac; nor should one show  (unreasonable) gravity by containing himself, to the utmost. One should  smile modestly, to show his interest (in what is before him). He that is  ever mindful of the king's welfare, and is neither exhilarated by reward  nor depressed by disgrace, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal  household. That learned courtier who always pleaseth the king and his  son with agreeable speeches, succeedeth in dwelling in a royal household  as a favourite. The favourite courtier who, having lost the royal favour  for just reason, does not speak evil of the king, regains prosperity.  The man who serveth the king or liveth in his domains, if sagacious,  should speak in praise of the king, both in his presence and absence.  The courtier who attempts to obtain his end by employing force on the  king, cannot keep his place long and incurs also the risk of death. None  should, for the purpose of self-interest, open communications with the  king's enemies.[8] Nor should one distinguish himself above the king in  matters requiring ability and talents. He that is always cheerful and  strong, brave and truthful and mild, and of subdued senses, and who  followeth his master like his shadow, is alone worthy to dwell in a  royal household. He that on being entrusted with a work, cometh forward,  saying,--_I will do this_--is alone worthy of living in a royal  household. He that on being entrusted with a task, either within the  king's dominion or out of it, never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 04 (#2)"],[1,"thought of his  time, with Lessing and Lavater, Goethe and even Helvetius. When in  1781 he left Hof for the University of Leipzig the pastor took leave  of the youth with the prophetic words: \"You will some time be able to  render me a greater service than I have rendered you. Remember this  prophecy.\"    Under such stimulating encouragement Richter began to write. Some  little essays, two addresses, and a novel, a happy chance has  preserved. The novel is an echo of Goethe's _Werther_, the essays are  marked by a clear, straightforward style, an absence of sentimentality  or mysticism, and an eagerness for reform that shows the influence of  Lessing. Religion is the dominant interest, but the youth is no longer  orthodox, indeed he is only conditionally Christian.    With such literary baggage, fortified with personal recommendations  and introductions from the Head Master at Hof, with a Certificate of  Maturity and a _testimonium paupertatis_ that might entitle him to  remission of fees and possibly free board, Richter went to Leipzig.  From the academic environment and its opportunities he got much, from  formal instruction little. He continued to be in the main self-taught  and extended his independence in manners and dress perhaps a little  beyond the verge of eccentricity. Meantime matters at home were going  rapidly from bad to worse. His grandfather had died; the inheritance  had been largely consumed in a law-suit. He could not look to his  mother for help and did not look to her for counsel. He suffered from  cold and stretched his credit for rent and food to the breaking point.  But the emptier his stomach the more his head abounded in plans \"for  writing books to earn money to buy books.\" He devised a system of  spelling reform and could submit to his pastor friend at Rehau in 1782  a little sheaf of essays on various aspects of Folly, the student  being now of an age when, like Iago, he was \"nothing if not critical.\"  Later these papers seemed to him little better than school exercises,  but they gave a promise soon to be redeemed in _Greenland Law-Suits_,  his first volume to find a publisher. These satirical sketches,  printed early in 1783, were followed later in that year by another  series, but both had to wait 38 years for a second edition, much  mellowed in revision--not altogether to its profit.    The point of the _Law-Suits_ is directed especially against  theologians and the nobility. Richter's uncompromising fierceness  suggests youthful hunger almost as much as study of Swift. But  Lessing, had he lived to read their stinging epigrams, would have  recognized in Richter the promise of a successor not unworthy to carry  the biting acid of the _Disowning Letter_ over to the hand of Heine.    The _Law-Suits_ proved too bitter for the public taste and it was  seven years before their author found another publisher. Meanwhile  Richter was leading a precarious existence, writing for magazines at  starvation prices, and persevering in an indefatigable search for some  one to undertake his next book, _Selections from the Papers of the  Devil_. A love affair with the daughter of a minor official which she,  at least, took seriously, interrupted his studies at Leipzig even  before the insistence of creditors compelled him to a clandestine  flight. This was in 1784. Then he shared for a time his mother's  poverty at Hof and from 1786 to 1789 was tutor in the house of  Oerthel, a parvenu Commercial-Counsellor in Toepen. This experience he  was to turn to good account in _Levana_ and in his first novel, _The  Invisible Lodge_, in which the unsympathetic figure of Roeper is  undoubtedly meant to present the not very gracious personality of the  Kommerzienrat.    To this period belongs a collection of _Aphorisms_ whose bright wit  reveals deep reflection. They show a maturing mind, keen insight,  livelier and wider sympathies. The _Devil's Papers_, published in  1789, when Richter, after a few months at Hof, was about to become  tutor to the children of three friendly families in Schwarzenbach,  confirm the impression of progress. In his new field Richter had great  freedom to develop his ideas of education as distinct from  inculcation. Rousseau was in the main his guide, and his success in  stimulating childish initiative through varied and ingenious  pedagogical experiments seems to have been really remarkable.    Quite as remarkable and much more disquieting were the ideas about  friendship and love which Richter now began to develop under the  stimulating influence of a group of young ladies at Hof. In a note  book of this time he writes: \"Prize question for the Erotic Academy:  How far may friendship toward women go and what is the difference  between it and love?\" That Richter called this circle his \"erotic  academy\" is significant. He was ever, in such relations, as alert to  observe as he was keen to sympathize and permitted himself an  astonishing variety of quickly changing and even simultaneous  experiments, both at Hof and later in the aristocratic circles that  were presently to open to him. In his theory, which finds fullest  expression in _Hesperus_, love was to be wholly platonic. If the first  kiss did not end it, the second surely would. \"I do not seek,\" he  says, \"the fairest face but the fairest heart. I can overlook all  spots on that, but none on this.\" \"He does not love who _sees_ his  beloved, but he who _thinks_ her.\" That is the theory. The practice  was a little different. It shows Richter at Hof exchanging fine-spun  sentiments on God, immortality and soul-affinity with some half dozen  young women to the perturbation of their spirits, in a transcendental  atmosphere of sentiment, arousing but never fulfilling the expectation  of a formal betrothal. That Jean Paul was capable of inspiring love of  the common sort is abundantly attested by his correspondence. Perhaps  no man ever had so many women of education and social position \"throw  themselves\" at him; but that he was capable of returning such love in  kind does not appear from acts or letters at this time, or, save  perhaps for the first years of his married life, at any later period.    The immediate effect of the bright hours at Hof on Richter as a writer  was wholly beneficent. _Mr. Florian Fuelbel's Journey_ and _Bailiff  Josuah Freudel's Complaint Bible_ show a new geniality in the  personification of amusing foibles. And with these was a real little  masterpiece, _Life of the Contented Schoolmaster Maria Wuz_, which  alone, said the Berlin critic Moritz, might suffice to make its author  immortal. In this delicious pedagogical idyl, written in December,  1790, the humor is sound, healthy, thoroughly German and  characteristic of Richter at his best. It seems as though one of the  great Dutch painters were guiding the pen, revealing the beauty of  common things and showing the true charm of quiet domesticity.  Richter's _Contented Schoolmaster_ lacked much in grace of form, but  it revealed unguessed resources in the German language, it showed  democratic sympathies more genuine than Rousseau's, it gave the  promise of a new pedagogy and a fruitful esthetic; above all it bore  the unmistakable mint-mark of genius.    _Wuz_ won cordial recognition from the critics. With the general  public it was for the time overshadowed by the success of a more  ambitious effort, Richter's first novel, _The Invisible Lodge_. This  fanciful tale of an idealized freemasonry is a study of the effects in  after life of a secluded education. Though written in the year of the  storming of the Tuileries it shows the prose-poet of the  Fichtelgebirge as yet untouched by the political convulsions of the  time. The _Lodge_, though involved in plot and reaching an empty  conclusion, yet appealed very strongly to the Germans of 1793 by its  descriptions of nature and its sentimentalized emotion. It was truly  of its time. Men and especially women liked then, better than they do  now, to read how \"the angel who loves the earth brought the most holy  lips of the pair together in an inextinguishable kiss, and a seraph  entered into their beating hearts and gave them the flames of a  supernal love.\" Of greater present interest than the heartbeats of  hero or heroine are the minor characters of the story, presenting  genially the various types of humor or studies from life made in the  \"erotic academy\" or in the families of Richter's pupils. The despotic  spendthrift, the Margrave of Bayreuth, has also his niche, or rather  pillory, in the story. Notable, too, is the tendency, later more  marked, to contrast the inconsiderate harshness of men with the  patient humility of women. Encouraged by Moritz, who declared the book  \"better than Goethe,\" Richter for the first time signed his work \"Jean  Paul.\" He was well paid for it and had no further serious financial  cares.    Before the _Lodge_ was out of press Jean Paul had begun _Hesperus, or  45 Dog-post-days_, which magnified the merits of the earlier novel but  also exaggerated its defects. Wanton eccentricity was given fuller  play, formlessness seemed cultivated as an art. Digressions interrupt  the narrative with slender excuse, or with none; there is, as with the  English Sterne, an obtrusion of the author's personality; the style  seems as wilfully crude as the mastery in word-building and  word-painting is astonishing. On the other hand there is both greater  variety and greater distinction in the characters, a more developed  fabulation and a wonderful deepening and refinement of emotional  description. _Werther_ was not yet out of fashion and lovers of his  \"Sorrows\" found in _Hesperus_ a book after their hearts. It  established the fame of Jean Paul for his generation. It brought women  by swarms to his feet. They were not discouraged there. It was his  platonic rule \"never to sacrifice one love to another,\" but to  experiment with \"simultaneous love,\" \"_tutti_ love,\" a \"genera"]]]
