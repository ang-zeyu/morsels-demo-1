In each instance, morphologic changes  in the cells of all parts of the brain were found, but it required  much more trauma to produce brain-cell changes in animals whose  blood-pressure was kept at the normal level than in the animals  whose blood-pressure was allowed to take a downward course.  In the cortex and in the cerebellum, the changes in the brain-cells  were in every instance more marked than in the medulla.    There is also strong NEGATIVE evidence that traumatic impulses  are not excluded by ether anesthesia from the part of the brain  that is apparently asleep.  This evidence is as follows:  If the factor of fear be excluded, and if in addition the traumatic  impulses be prevented from reaching the brain by cocain[*] blocking,  then, despite the intensity or the duration of the trauma within  the zone so blocked, there follows no exhaustion after the effect  of the anesthetic disappears, and no morphologic changes are noted  in the brain-cells.      [*] Since the presentation of this paper, novocain has been  substituted for cocain in operations under anoci-association.      Still further negative evidence that inhalation anesthesia offers  little or no protection to the brain-cells against trauma is derived  from the following experiment:  A dog whose spinal cord had been  divided at the level of the first dorsal segment, and which had  then been kept in good condition for two months, showed a recovery  of the spinal reflexes, such as the scratch reflex, etc.  Such an  animal is known as a \"spinal dog.\"  Now, in this animal, the abdomen  and hind extremities had no direct nerve connection with the brain.  In this dog, continuous severe trauma of the abdominal viscera and of  the hind extremities lasting for four <p 5-7> hours was accompanied  by but slight change in either the circulation or in the respiration,  and by no microscopic alteration of the brain-cells (Fig. 1). Judging  from a large number of experiments on NORMAL dogs under ether,  such an amount of trauma would have caused not only complete  physiologic exhaustion of the brain, but also morphologic alterations  of all of the brain-cells and the physical destruction of many  (Fig. 2). We must, therefore, conclude that, although ether anesthesia  produces unconsciousness, it APPARENTLY PROTECTS NONE OF THE BRAIN-CELLS  against exhaustion from the trauma of surgical operations; ether is,  so to speak, but a veneer.  Under nitrous oxid anesthesia there is  approximately only one-fourth as much exhaustion as is produced by equal  trauma under ether (Fig. 3). We must conclude, therefore, either that  nitrous oxid protects the brain-cells against trauma or that ether  predisposes the brain-cells to exhaustion as a result of trauma.  With these premises let us now inquire into the cause of this  exhaustion of the brain-cells.      The Cause of the Exhaustion of the Brain-cells as a Result of Trauma  of Various Parts of the Body under Inhalation Anesthesia      Numerous experiments on animals to determine the effect of ether  anesthesia _per se_, _i.  e_., ether anesthesia without trauma,  showed that, although certain changes were produced, these included  neither the physiologic exhaustion nor the alterations in the  brain-cells which are characteristic of the effects of trauma.  On turning to the study of trauma, we at once found in the behavior  of individuals as a whole under deep and under light anesthesia  the clue to the cause of the discharge of energy, of the consequent  physiologic exhaustion, and of the morphologic changes in the brain-cells.    If, in the course of abdominal operations, rough manipulations  of the parietal peritoneum be made, there will be frequently  observed a marked increase in the respiratory rate and an increase  in the expiratory force which may be marked by the production  of an audible expiratory groan.  Under light ether anesthesia,  severe manipulations of the peritoneum often cause such vigorous  contractions of the abdominal muscles that the operator is greatly  hindered in his work.    Among the unconscious responses to trauma under ether anesthesia  are purposeless moving, the withdrawal of the injured part, and,  if the anesthesia be sufficiently light and the trauma sufficiently  strong, there may be an effort toward escape from the injury.  In injury under ether anesthesia every grade of response may be seen,  from the slightest change in the respiration or in the blood-pressure  to a vigorous defensive struggle.  As to the purpose of these  subconscious movements in response to injury, there can be no doubt--  THEY ARE EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE INJURY.    Picture what would be the result of a formidable abdominal operation  extending over a period of half an hour or more on an unanesthetized  human patient, during which extensive adhesions had been broken up,  or a large tumor dislodged from its bed!  In such a case,  would not the nervous system discharge its energy to the utmost  in efforts to escape from the injury, and would not the patient suffer  complete exhaustion?  If the traumata under inhalation anesthesia  are sufficiently strong and are repeated in sufficient numbers,  the brain-cells are finally deprived of their dischargeable nervous  energy and become exhausted just as exhaustion follows such strenuous  and prolonged muscular exertion as is seen in endurance tests.  Whether the energy of the brain be discharged by injury under anesthesia  or by ordinary muscular exertion, identical morphologic changes are  seen in the nerve-cells. In shock from injury (Fig. 2), in exhaustion  from overwork (Hodge and Dolley) (Fig. 4), and in exhaustion from pure fear  (Fig. 5), the resultant general functional weakness is similar--  in each case a certain length of time is required to effect recovery,  and in each there are morphologic changes in the brain-cells. It  is quite clear that in each of these cases the altered function  and form of the brain-cells are due to an _*excessive discharge  of nervous energy_.  This brings us to the next question:  What determines the discharge of energy as a result of trauma  with or without inhalation anesthesia?      The Cause of the Discharge of Nervous Energy as a Result of Trauma  under Inhalation Anesthesia and under Normal Conditions      I looked into this problem from many viewpoints and there seemed  to be no solution until it occurred to me to seek the explanation  in certain of the postulates which make up the doctrine of evolution.  I realize fully the difficulty and the danger in attempting  to reach the generalization which I shall make later and in  the hypothesis I shall propose, for there is, of course, no direct  final proof of the truth of even the doctrine of evolution.  It is idle to consider any experimental research into the cause  of phenomena that have developed by natural selection during  millions of years.  Nature herself has made the experiments on  a world-wide scale and the data are before us for interpretation.  Darwin could do no more than to collect all available facts and then  to frame the hypothesis by which the facts were best harmonized.  Sherrington, that masterly physiologist, in his volume entitled  \"The Integrative Action of the Nervous System,\" shows clearly how  the central nervous system was built up in the process of evolution.  Sherrington has made free use of Darwin's doctrine in explaining  physiologic functions, just as anatomists have extensively  utilized it in the explanation of the genesis of anatomic forms.  I shall assume, therefore, that the discharge of nervous energy is  accomplished by the application of the laws of inheritance and association,  and I conclude that this hypothesis will explain many clinical phenomena.  I shall now present such evidence in favor of this hypothesis as time  and my limitations will admit, after which I shall point out certain  clinical facts that may be explained by this hypothesis.    According to the doctrine of evolution, every function owes  its origin to natural selection in the struggle for existence.  In the lower and simpler forms of animal life, indeed, in our  human progenitors as well, existence depended principally upon  the success with which three great purposes were achieved:  (1) Self-defense against or escape from enemies; (2) the acquisition  of food; and (3) procreation; and these were virtually the only purposes  for which nervous energy was discharged.  In its last analysis,  in a biologic sense, this statement holds true of man today.  Disregarding for the present the expenditure of energy for procuring  food and for procreation, let us consider the discharge of energy  for self-preservation. The mechanisms for self-defense which we  now possess were developed in the course of vast periods of time  through innumerable intermediary stages from those possessed by  the lowest forms of life.  One would suppose, therefore, that we must  now be in possession of mechanisms which still discharge energy on  adequate stimulation, but which are not suited to our present needs.  We shall point out some examples of such unnecessary mechanisms.  As Sherrington has stated, our skin, in which are implanted many  receptors for receiving specific stimuli which are transmitted  to the brain, is interposed between ourselves and the environment  in which we are immersed.  When these stimuli reach the brain,  there is a specific response,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12342"],[0,"The Nuttall Encyclopædia (#2)"],[1,"the reigns of James I.  and Charles I., and one of the translators of King James's Bible; an  enemy of Laud's, who succeeded him (1562-1633).
