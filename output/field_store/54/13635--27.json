Histories of Sexual Development.          SEXUAL SELECTION IN MAN.    The External Sensory Stimuli Affecting Selection in Man--The Four Senses  Involved.      Tumescence--the process by which the organism is brought into the physical  and psychic state necessary to insure conjugation and detumescence--to  some extent comes about through the spontaneous action of internal forces.  To that extent it is analogous to the physical and psychic changes which  accompany the gradual filling of the bladder and precede its evacuation.  But even among animals who are by no means high in the zooelogical scale  the process is more complicated than this. External stimuli act at every  stage, arousing or heightening the process of tumescence, and in normal  human beings it may be said that the process is never completed without  the aid of such stimuli, for even in the auto-erotic sphere external  stimuli are still active, either actually or in imagination.    The chief stimuli which influence tumescence and thus direct sexual choice  come chiefly--indeed, exclusively--through the four senses of touch,  smell, hearing, and sight. All the phenomena of sexual selection, so far  as they are based externally, act through these four senses.[1] The  reality of the influence thus exerted may be demonstrated statistically  even in civilized man, and it has been shown that, as regards, for  instance, eye-color, conjugal partners differ sensibly from the unmarried  persons by whom they are surrounded. When, therefore, we are exploring the  nature of the influence which stimuli, acting through the sensory  channels, exert on the strength and direction of the sexual impulse, we  are intimately concerned with the process by which the actual form and  color, not alone of living things generally, but of our own species, have  been shaped and are still being shaped. At the same time, it is probable,  we are exploring the mystery which underlies all the subtle appreciations,  all the emotional undertones, which are woven in the web of the whole  world as it appeals to us through those sensory passages by which alone it  can reach us. We are here approaching, therefore, a fundamental subject of  unsurpassable importance, a subject which has not yet been accurately  explored save at a few isolated points and one which it is therefore  impossible to deal with fully and adequately. Yet it cannot be passed  over, for it enters into the whole psychology of the sexual instinct.    Of the four senses--touch, smell, hearing, and sight--with which we are  here concerned, touch is the most primitive, and it may be said to be the  most important, though it is usually the last to make its appeal felt.  Smell, which occupies the chief place among many animals, is of  comparatively less importance, though of considerable interest, in man; it  is only less intimate and final than touch. Sight occupies an intermediate  position, and on this account, and also on account of the very great part  played by vision in life generally as well as in art, it is the most  important of all the senses from the human sexual point of view. Hearing,  from the same point of view, is the most remote of all the senses in its  appeal to the sexual impulse, and on that account it is, when it  intervenes, among the first to make its influence felt.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Taste must, I believe, be excluded, for if we abstract the parts of  touch and smell, even in those abnormal sexual acts in which it may seem  to be affected, taste could scarcely have any influence. Most of our  \"tasting,\" as Waller puts it, is done by the nose, which, in man, is in  specially close relationship, posteriorly, with the mouth. There are at  most four taste sensations--sweet, bitter, salt, and sour--if even all of  these are simple tastes. What commonly pass for taste sensations, as shown  by some experiments of G.T.W. Patrick (_Psychological Review_, 1898, p.  160), are the composite results of the mingling of sensations of smell,  touch, temperature, sight, and taste.          TOUCH.    I.

We are accustomed to regard the skin as mainly owing its existence to the  need for the protection of the delicate vessels, nerves, viscera, and  muscles underneath. Undoubtedly it performs, and by its tough and elastic  texture is well fitted to perform, this extremely important service. But  the skin is not merely a method of protection against the external world;  it is also a method of bringing us into sensitive contact with the  external world. It is thus, as the organ of touch, the seat of the most  widely diffused sense we possess, and, moreover, the sense which is the  most ancient and fundamental of all--the mother of the other senses.    It is scarcely necessary to insist that the primitive nature of the  sensory function of the skin with the derivative nature of the other  senses, is a well ascertained and demonstrable fact. The lower we descend  in the animal scale, the more varied we find the functions of the skin to  be, and if in the higher animals much of the complexity has disappeared,  that is only because the specialization of the various skin regions into  distinct organs has rendered this complexity unnecessary. Even yet,  however, in man himself the skin still retains, in a more or less latent  condition, much of its varied and primary power, and the analysis of  pathological and even normal phenomena serves to bring these old powers  into clear light.        Woods Hutchinson (_Studies in Human and Comparative Pathology_,      1901, Chapters VII and VIII) has admirably set forth the immense      importance of the skin, as in the first place \"a tissue which is      silk to the touch, the most exquisitely beautiful surface in the      universe to the eye, and yet a wall of adamant against hostile      attack. Impervious alike, by virtue of its wonderful responsive      vitality, to moisture and drought, cold and heat, electrical      changes, hostile bacteria, the most virulent of poisons and the      deadliest of gases, it is one of the real Wonders of the World.      More beautiful than velvet, softer and more pliable than silk,      more impervious than rubber, and more durable under exposure than      steel, well-nigh as resistant to electric currents as glass, it      is one of the toughest and most dangerproof substances in the      three kingdoms of nature\" (although, as this author adds, we      \"hardly dare permit it to see the sunlight or breathe the open      air\"). But it is more than this. It is, as Woods Hutchinson      expresses it, the creator of the entire body; its embryonic      infoldings form the alimentary canal, the brain, the spinal cord,      while every sense is but a specialization of its general organic      activity. It is furthermore a kind of \"skin-heart,\" promoting the      circulation by its own energy; it is the great heat-regulating      organ of the body; it is an excretory organ only second to the      kidneys, which descend from it, and finally it still remains the      seat of touch.        It may be added that the extreme beauty of the skin as a surface      is very clearly brought out by the inadequacy of the comparisons      commonly used in order to express its beauty. Snow, marble,      alabaster, ivory, milk, cream, silk, velvet, and all the other      conventional similes furnish surfaces which from any point of      view are incomparably inferior to the skin itself. (Cf. Stratz,      _Die Schoenheit des Weiblichen Koerpers_, Chapter XII.)        With reference to the extraordinary vitality of the skin,      emphasized by Woods Hutchinson, it may be added that, when      experimenting on the skin with the electric current, Waller found      that healthy skin showed signs of life ten days or more after      excision. It has been found also that fragments of skin which      have been preserved in sterile fluid for even as long as nine      months may still be successfully transplanted on to the body.      (_British Medical Journal_, July 19, 1902.)        Everything indicates, remark Stanley Hall and Donaldson (\"Motor      Sensations in the Skin,\" _Mind_, 1885), that the skin is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#2)"],[1,"Erotic Fetiches--The Normal Foundations of  Erotic Symbolism--Classification of the Phenomena--The Tendency to  Idealize the Defects of a Beloved Person--Stendhal's \"Crystallization.\"      By \"erotic symbolism\" I mean that tendency whereby the lover's attention  is diverted from the central focus of sexual attraction to some object or  process which is on the periphery of that focus, or is even outside of it  altogether, though recalling it by association of contiguity or of  similarity. It thus happens that tumescence, or even in extreme cases  detumescence, may be provoked by the contemplation of acts or objects  which are away from the end of sexual conjugation.[1]    In considering the phenomena of sexual selection in a previous volume,[2]  it was found that there are four or five main factors in the constitution  of beauty in so far as beauty determines sexual selection. Erotic  symbolism is founded on the factor of individual taste in beauty; it  arises as a specialized development of that factor, but it is,  nevertheless, incorrect to merge it in sexual selection. The attractive  characteristics of a beloved woman or man, from the point of view of  sexual selection, are a complex but harmonious whole leading up to a  desire for the complete possession of the person who displays them. There  is no tendency to isolate and dissociate any single character from the  individual and to concentrate attention upon that character at the expense  of the attention bestowed upon the individual generally. As soon as such a  tendency begins to show itself, even though only in a slight or temporary  form, we may say that there is erotic symbolism.    Erotic symbolism is, however, by no means confined to the individualizing  tendency to concentrate amorous attention upon some single characteristic  of the adult woman or man who is normally the object of sexual love. The  adult human being may not be concerned at all, the attractive object or  act may not even be human, not even animal, and we may still be concerned  with a symbol which has parasitically rooted itself on the fruitful site  of sexual emotion and absorbed to itself the energy which normally goes  into the channels of healthy human love having for its final end the  procreation of the species. Thus understood in its widest sense, it may be  said that every sexual perversion, even homosexuality, is a form of erotic  symbolism, for we shall find that in every case some object or act that  for the normal human being has little or no erotic value, has assumed such  value in a supreme degree; that is to say, it has become a symbol of the  normal object of love. Certain perversions are, however, of such great  importance on account of their wide relationships, that they cannot be  adequately discussed merely as forms of erotic symbolism. This is notably  the case as regards homosexuality, auto-erotism, and algolagnia, all of  which phenomena have therefore been separately discussed in previous  studies. We are now mainly concerned with manifestations which are more  narrowly and exclusively symbolical.    A portion of the field of erotic symbolism is covered by what Binet  (followed by Lombroso, Krafft-Ebing, and others) has termed \"erotic  fetichism,\" or the tendency whereby sexual attraction is unduly exerted by  some special part or peculiarity of the body, or by some inanimate object  which has become associated with it. Such erotic symbolism of object  cannot, however, be dissociated from the even more important erotic  symbolism of process, and the two are so closely bound together that we  cannot attain a truly scientific view of them until we regard them broadly  as related parts of a common psychic tendency. If, as Groos asserts,[3] a  symbol has two chief meanings, one in which it indicates a physical  process which stands for a psychic process, and another in which it  indicates a part which represents the whole, erotic symbolism of act  corresponds to the first of these chief meanings, and erotic symbolism of  object to the other.    Although it is not impossible to find some germs of erotic symbolism in  animals, in its more pronounced manifestations it is only found in the  human species. It could not be otherwise, for such symbolism involves not  only the play of fancy and imagination, the idealizing aptitude, but also  a certain amount of power of concentrating the attention on a point  outside the natural path of instinct and the ability to form new mental  constructions around that point. There are, indeed, as we shall see,  elementary forms of erotic symbolism which are not uncommonly associated  with feeble-mindedness, but even these are still peculiarly human, and in  its less crude manifestations erotic symbolism easily lends itself to  every degree of human refinement and intelligence.        \"It depends primarily upon an increase of the psychological      process of representation,\" Colin Scott remarks of sexual      symbolism generally, \"involving greater powers of comparison and      analysis as compared with the lower animals. The outer      impressions come to be clearly distinguished as such, but at the      same time are often treated as symbols of inner experiences, and      a meaning read into them which they would not otherwise possess.      Symbolism or fetichism is, indeed, just the capacity to see      meaning, to emphasize something for the sake of other things      which do not appear. In brain terms it indicates an activity of      the higher centers, a sort of side-tracking or long-circuiting of      the primitive energy; ... Rosetti's poem, 'The Woodspurge,'      gives a concrete example of the formation of such a symbol. Here      the otherwise insignificant presentation of the three-cupped      woodspurge, representing originally a mere side-current of the      stream of consciousness, becomes the intellectual symbol or      fetich of the whole psychosis forever after. It seems, indeed, as      if the stronger the emotion the more likely will become the      formation of an overlying symbolism, which serves to focus and      stand in the place of something greater than itself; nowhere at      least is symbolism a more characteristic feature than as an      expression of the sexual instinct. The passion of sex, with its      immense hereditary background, in early man became centered often      upon the most trivial and unimportant features.... This      symbolism, now become fetichistic, or symbolic in a bad sense, is      at least an exercise of the increasing representative power of      man, upon which so much of his advancement has depended, while it      also served to express and help to purify his most perennial      emotion.\" (Colin Scott, \"Sex and Art,\" _American Journal of      Psychology_, vol. vii, No. 2, p. 189.)    In the study of \"Love and Pain\" in a previous volume, the analysis of the  large and complex mass of sexual phenomena which are associated with pain,  gradually resolved them to a considerable extent into a special case of  erotic symbolism; pain or restraint, whether inflicted on or by the loved  person, becomes, by a psychic process that is usually unconscious, the  symbol of the sexual mechanism, and hence arouses the same emotions as  that mechanism normally arouses. We may now attempt to deal more broadly  and comprehensively with the normal and abnormal aspects of erotic  symbolism in some of their most typical and least mixed forms.    \"When our human imagination seeks to animate artificial things,\" Huysmans  writes in _La-bas_, \"it is compelled to reproduce the movements of animals  in the act of propagation. Look at machines, at the play of pistons in the  cylinders; they are Romeos of steel in Juliets of cast-iron.\" And not only  in the work of man's hands but throughout Nature we find sexual symbols  which are the less deniable since, for the most part, they make not the  slightest appeal to even the most morbid human imagination. Language is  full of metaphorical symbols of sex which constantly tend to lose their  poetic symbolism and to become commonplace. Semen is but seed, and for the  Latins especially the whole process of human sex, as well as the male and  female organs, constantly presented itself in symbols derived from  agricultural and horticultural life. The testicles were beans (_fabae_) and  fruit or apples (_poma_ and _mala_); the penis was a tree (_arbor_), or a  stalk (_thyrsus_), or a root (_radix_), or a sickle (_falx_), or a  ploughshare (_vomer_). The semen, again, was dew (_ros_). The labia majora  or minora were wings (_alae_); the vulva and vagina were a field (_ager_  and _campus_), or a ploughed furrow (_sulcus_), or a vineyard (_vinea_),  or a fountain (_fons_), while the pudendal hair was herbage  (_plantaria_).[4] In other languages it is not difficult to trace similar  and even identical imagery applied to sexual organs and sexual acts. Thus  it is noteworthy that Shakespeare more than once applies the term  \"ploughed\" to a woman who has had sexual intercourse. The Talmud calls the  labia minora the doors, the labia majora hinges, and the clitoris the key.  The Greeks appear not only to have found in the myrtle-berry, the fruit of  a plant sacred to Venus, the image of the clitoris, but also in the rose  an image of the feminine labia; in the poetic literature of many  countries, indeed, this imagery of the rose may be traced in a more or  less veiled manner.[5]    The widespread symbolism of sex arose in the theories and conceptions of  primitive peoples concerning the function of generation and its nearest  analogies in Nature; it was continued for the sake of the vigorous and  expressive terminology which it furnished both for daily life and for  literature; its final survivals were cultivated because they furnished a  delicately aesthetic method of approaching matters which a growing  refinement of sentiment made it difficult for lovers and"]]]
