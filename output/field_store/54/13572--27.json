The  markings on the back represent to their fertile imaginations the head of a  perfect skeleton, with the limb bones crossed beneath; its cry becomes the  voice of anguish, the moaning of a child, the signal of grief; it is  regarded, not as the creation of a benevolent being, but as the device of  evil spirits--spirits, enemies to man, conceived and fabricated in the  dark; and the very shining of its eyes is supposed to represent the fiery  element whence it is thought to have proceeded. Flying into their  apartments in an evening, it at times extinguishes the light, foretelling  war, pestilence, famine, and death to man and beast. * * * This insect  has been thought to be peculiarly gifted in having a voice and  squeaking like a mouse when handled or disturbed; but, in truth, no insect  that we know of has the requisite organs to produce a genuine voice; they  emit sounds by other means, probably all external.\"    The Icelanders believe _Seals_ to be the offspring of Pharaoh and his host;  who, they assert, were changed into these animals when overwhelmed in the  Red Sea. The _Grampus_, _Porpoise_, and _Dolphin_, have each from the  earliest ages been the subject of numerous superstitions and fables,  particularly the latter, which was believed to have a great attachment to  the human race, and to succour them in accidents by sea; it is a perfectly  straight fish, yet even painters have promulgated a falsity respecting it,  by representing it from the curved form in which it appears above water,  bent like the letter S reversed. \"The inhabitants of Pesquare,\" says Dr.  Belon, \"and of the borders of Lake Gourd are firmly persuaded that the  _Carp_ of those lakes are nourished with pure gold; and a great portion of  the people in the Lyonnois are fully satisfied that the fish called  _humble_ and _ernblons_ eat no other food than gold. There is not a  peasant in the environs of the Lake of Bourgil who will not maintain that  the _Laurets_, a fish sold daily in Lyons, feed on pure gold alone. The  same is the belief of the people of the Lake Paladron in Savoy, and of  those near Lodi. But,\" adds the Doctor, \"having carefully examined the  stomachs of these several fishes, I have found that they lived on other  substances, and that from the anatomy of the stomach it is impossible that  they should be able to digest gold.\" This fable, therefore, with that of  the _Chameleon_ living on air only, and some others which we shall have  occasion to mention, may be regarded amongst those exploded by science.    The fable of the _Kraken_ has been referred to imperfect and exaggerated  accounts of monstrous _Polypi_ infesting the northern seas; how far may  not the _Cuttle-fish_ have given rise to this fiction? In hot countries  (our readers will remember that in a late paper, _Mirror_, vol. xvii. pp.  282-299, we directed their attention to the similarity of superstitions in  every country of the world, hence infering a common, and most probably  oriental origin for all)--in hot countries cuttle-fish are found of  gigantic dimensions; the Indians affirm that some have been seen two  fathoms broad over their centre; and each arm (for this kind is the  eight-armed cuttle-fish) nine fathoms long!!! Lest these animals should  fling their arms over the Indians' light canoes, and draw them and their  owners into the sea, they fail not to be provided with an axe to chop them  off.    The ancients believed that the oil of the _Grayling_ obliterated freckles  and small-pox marks. The adhesive qualities of the _Remora_, or  _Sucking-fish_, and its habit of darting against and fixing itself to the  side of a vessel, caused the ancients to believe that the possessors of it  had the power of arresting the progress of a ship in full sail.    Some Catholics, in consequence of the _John Doree_ having a dark spot,  like a finger-mark, on each side of the head, believe this to have been  the fish, and not the _Haddock_, from which the Apostle Peter took the  tribute-money, by order of our Saviour. The modern Greeks denominate it  \"the fish of St. Christopher,\" from a legend which relates that it was  trodden on by that saint, when he bore his divine burden across an arm of  the sea. Some species of _Echini_, fossilized, and seen frequently in  Norfolk, are termed by the ignorant peasantry, and considered, _Fairy  Loaves_, to take which, when found, is highly unlucky.    The _Amphisbaena_, from its faculty of moving backwards or forwards at  pleasure, has been thought to have a head at either extremity of its  reptile body, but close inspection proves this opinion false. The  fascinating power of the _Rattlesnake_, of which so many stories have in  times past been related, and which was asserted to exist in its glittering  eyes, has been of late years resolved into that extreme nervous terror of  its victim (at sight of so certain a foe) which deprives it of the power  of motion, and causes it to fall, an unresisting prey, into the reptile's  jaws. We may here pause to observe, _en passant_, that the antipathy which  people of all ages and nations have felt against every reptile of the  serpent tribe, from the harmless worm to the hosts of deadly \"dragons\"  which infest the torrid zone, and the popular opinion that all are  venomous, often in spite of experience, seems to be not so much  superstition, as a terror of the species, implanted, since the fall, in  our bosoms, by the same Divine Being who at that period pronounced the  serpent to be the most accursed beast of the field.

Nothing if not political appears to be the order of the new magazine and  other literary enterprises of the present day. Is this good policy in  itself? it may be so from the vivifying aid it lends to the springs of  imaginative writing. We have therefore no right to complain of the  _leaven_ of Mr. Tait's Magazine: it is anything but dull: _e.g._ the life  and jauntiness of the following paper is very pleasant, shrewd, and clever:    _The Martinet_.    The \"Martinet\" is the name of a genus, not of a species; the title of a  race variously feathered, but having specific qualities in common. There  is your military martinet, your clerical martinet, your legal martinet,  and the martinet of common life, (\"_Gallicrista fastidiosa communis_,\"  Linnaeus would class him,) who is to the others what the house-sparrow is  to the rest of his tribe. It is with him alone we have to do. The  \"martinet\" is a person who is all his life violently busied in  endeavouring to be a perfect gentleman, and who _almost_ succeeds. He  misses the point by over-stepping it. He is like one of those greyhounds  which outrun the hare fleetly enough, but cannot \"_take_\" her when they  have done so. They have a little too much speed, and a little too little  tact. The martinet is always bent upon thinking, saying, doing, and having,  every thing after a nicer fashion than other people, until his nicety runs  into downright mannerism; all his ideas become \"clipped taffeta,\" and all  his eggs are known to have \"two yolks.\" He rarely comes of age or is  thoroughly ripe till near forty, before which he may be a little of the  precise fop, and after which he changes to the somewhat foppish precisian,  which is the best definition of him. He would be an excellent member of  society were he not a little too nice for its every-day work, which, to  speak a truth in metaphor, will not always admit of white gloves. He is  remarkably consistent in all his proceedings, however, and the outward man  is a perfect and complete type of the inward, and _vice versa_. His soul  is never out of pumps and silk stockings, and picks its way amidst the  little mental puddles and cross-roads of this world with a chariness of  step, which is at once edifying and amusing. Of inward show _he_ is not  less \"elaborate\" than of outward; and, though a descendant of Eve, takes  equal care of the clothing of both mind and body.    Were his tailor to be abandoned enough to attempt to palm upon him a coat  of the very best Yorkshire, instead of the very best Wiltshire broad-cloth,  (an enormity of which--_horresco referens_--he was once very near being  the victim,) the one would be sure to lose, if discovered, the best of his  customers, and the other the best of a month's sleep. If he wears a wig,  his expenditure with his _peruquier_ is never less than five-and-twenty  guineas a-year. His cigars, though he smokes little, cost him nearly as  much. His hat is water-proof; his stop-watch and repeater are of a  scapement that never varies more than six seconds in the twelve months  from the time-piece at the Observatory at Greenwich, where he has a friend,  who is so good as sometimes to compare notes with him. By the advice of  his boot-maker--who, by the way, has some knowledge of the length of his  foot--he never puts on a new pair until they are at least a year old; and  he parted with his last footboy because he one day discovered a  perceptible difference between the polish of the right and left foot. In  winter, he wears and recommends cork soles. His toilet is no sinecure; and  on the table are always to be found, besides his dressing-box, which  contains an assortment of combs, scissors, tweezers, pomades, and essences,  not easily equalled, a bottle of \"Eau de Cologne, veritable,\" a Packwood  and Criterion strop; a case of gold-mounted razors, (the best in England,)  which he bought, nearly thirty years ago, of the successor of \"Warren,\" in  the Strand, and a silvered shaving-pot, upon a principle of his own,  redolent of Rigges' \"patent violet-scented soap.\" His net-silk purse is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12552"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The terms for drinking the waters are  furnished at the lodge, where the visiter may smile at the remedy being  _set to music_, in the melodies of the Beulah Spring Quadrilles. It may  prevent some disappointment by stating that the Grounds are not opened to  the public on Sundays.

Its flavour is that of Sulphate of Magnesia, or _Epsom Salts;_          and we should say that our _modicum_ might be imitated by          dissolving a dram of the above ingredient in half-a-pint of          pure water.           *       *       *       *       *          RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.    ANCIENT LAWS.      The following quaint observations possess peculiar interest at the present  moment:    \"Among the ancient Druids,\" says Mr. Owen Feltham, \"it was absolutely  forbidden to register their laws in writing. And Caesar, in his Gallique  Wars, gives us two reasons for it. One, that their mysteries might not  come to be profaned and encommoned by the vulgar: another, that not being  written, they might be more careful ever to carry them in their thoughts  and memory. Though doubtless it was as well to preserve their own  authority, to keep the people to a recourse to them, and to a reverence  and esteem of their judgments. Besides, it oft falls out that what is  written, though it were a good law when made, yet by the emergency of  affairs, and the condition of men and times, it happens to be bad and  alterable. And we find it to be evidently true, that, as where there are  many physicians, there are many diseases; so where there are many laws,  there are likewise many enormities. That nation that swarms with law and  lawyers, certainly abounds with vice and corruption. Where you find much  fowl resort, you may be sure there is no want of either water, mud, or  weeds.    \"In the beginning of thriving states, when they are more industrious and  innocent, they have then the fewest laws. Rome itself had at first but  twelve tables. But after, how infinitely did their number of laws increase!  Old states, like old bodies will be sure to contract diseases. And where  the law-makers are many, the laws will never be few. That nation is in  best estate that hath the fewest laws, and those good. Variety does but  multiply snares. If every bush be limed, there is no bird can escape with  all his feathers free. And many times when the law did not intend it, men  are made guilty by the pleader's oratory; either to express his eloquence,  to advance his practice, or out of mastery to carry his cause: like a  garment pounced with dust, the business is so smeared and tangled that  without a Galilaeus his glass, you can never come to discern the spots of  this changeable moon. Sometimes to gratify a powerful party, justice is  made blind through corruption, as well as out of impartiality. That indeed,  by reason of the non-integrity of men. To go to law, is, for two to  contrive the kindling of a fire at their own cost, to warm others, and  singe themselves to cinders. Because they cannot agree to what is truth  and equity, they will both agree to plume themselves, that others may be  stuck with their feathers.\"    W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *    OLD WEATHER RHYMES.    Rhymes which refer to the weather were probably written by the monks.      If St. Paul be fine and clear,    We shall have a happy year.    If St. Paul be thick with rain,    Then dear will be the price of grain.      After St. Bartholomew    Come long evenings and cold dew.      February fill dyke,    Be it black or be it white,    But if it is white,    It is better to like.      March winds and April showers,    Bring forth May flowers.      He who views his wheat on a weeping May,    Will himself so weeping away;    But he who views it on a weeping June,    Will go away in another tune.      When the sand doth feed the clay,    England woe and well-a-day:    But when the clay doth feed the sand,    Then it is well with Angle Land.      A swarm of bees in May    Is worth a load of hay,    A swarm of bees in June    Is worth a silver spoon.    A swarm of bees in July    Is not worth a fly.

The latter referred to the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward IV., Mary and  Philip, and Queen Elizabeth, but proved false prophecy.

In the days of Monks and Friars, the following lines in bad Latin, were  composed on Crowland, Lincolnshire, or the adjoining Abbey:      In Hollandia stat Crowland;    Ibi vinium talequale,    Ibi foenum gladiale    Ibi lecti lapidale,    Ibi viri boreali,    Ibi vale sine vale.    They are thus translated in the _Beauties of England and Wales_ (1767):--      \"In Holland stands Crowland    Built on dirty low land.    Where you'll find, if you go,    The wine's but so so;    The blades of the hay    Are like swords one may say,    The beds are like stones,    And break a man's bones;    The men rough and sturdy,    Compliments will afford me    But bid you good b'w'y,    When both hungry and dry.\"    W.H.           *       *       *       *       *      THE HOBBY HORSE.    Bromley Pagets was remarkable for a very singular sport on New Year's Day  and Twelfth Day, called the Hobby Horse Dance: a person rode upon the  image of a horse, with a bow and arrow in his hands, with which he made a  snapping noise, keeping time with the music, whilst six others danced the  hay and other country dances, with as many rein-deer's heads on their  shoulders. To this hobby-horse belonged a pot, which the Reeves of the  town kept and filled with cakes and ale, towards which the spectators  contributed a penny, and with the remainder maintained their poor and  repaired the church.--W.H.           *       *       *       *       *      HOLY LAND.    Ramsey Island, near St. David's Head, is said to have been inhabited by so  many saints, that no less than twenty thousand are stated in ancient  histories to lie interred there. Near this place are the rocks styled the  Bishop and his Clerks, which, says an ancient author \"preache deadly  doctrine to their winter audience, such poor sea-faring men as are forcyd  thether by tempest, onelie in one thing they are to be commended, they  keepe residence better than the rest of the canons of that see (St.  David's) are wont to do.\"    W.H.           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES.    After the Britons retired into Wales, it was enacted that no man should  guide a plough that could not make one; and that the driver should make  the ropes of twisted willows, with which it was drawn. It was usual for  six or eight persons to form themselves into a society for fitting out one  of these ploughs, providing it with oxen, and every thing necessary for  ploughing; and many curious laws were made for the regulation of such  societies. If any person laid dung on the field with the consent of the  proprietor, he was by law allowed the use of that land for one year. If  the dung was carried out in a cart in great abundance, he was to have the  use of the land for three years. Whoever cut down a wood, and converted  the ground into arable, with the consent of the owner, was to have the use  of it for five years. If any one folded his cattle for one year, upon a  piece of ground belonging to another, with the owner's consent, he was  allowed the use of the ground for four years. Thus, though the Britons had  in a great measure lost the knowledge of agriculture, they appear to have  been very assiduous in giving encouragement to such as would attempt the  revival of it.    T.

We continue our extracts from this very entertaining work, the following  being from the second volume.    At Boossa, the travellers receive a visit from \"the noted widow Zuma.\" She  must be an Amazonian lady, for, having quarrelled with her prince, the  ruler of Wowow, she was obliged to fly, and actually to climb over the  city wall in the night, and travel on foot to Boossa. Female politicians  in Africa are not so safe as in the _coteries_ of civilized Europe: they  have to fight their own battles, and we conclude, to raise their own  supplies: \"the widow complained sadly of poverty and the hardness of the  times; she had fought with the Yarribeans against Alorie; but instead of  receiving a recompense for her bravery, she had lost half her slaves in an  engagement, which so disgusted her with the military profession, that she  immediately abandoned it and returned home. Yet, in spite of all her  losses and misfortunes, she has gained so much in corpulency, that it was  with the utmost difficulty, she could squeeze herself into the doorway of  our hut, although it is by no means small. The widow Zuma is a very  good-looking, elderly person of matronly appearance. Her skin is of a  light copper colour.\" Should this meet the eye of any soldier of fortune,  &c.
