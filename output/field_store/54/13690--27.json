Again, the life in the newspaper office, so amusingly  depicted in _The Journalists_, was out of the fulness of his own  experience as editor of a political sheet. A hundred little natural  touches thus add to the realism of the whole and make the figures, as  a German critic says, \"stand out like marble statues against a hedge  of yew.\" The reproach has been made that many of Freytag's characters  are too much alike. He has distinct types which repeat themselves both  in the novels and in the plays. George Saalfeld in _Valentine_, for  instance, is strikingly like Bolz in _The Journalists_ or Fink in  _Debit and Credit_. Freytag's answer to such objections was that an  author, like any other artist, must work from models, which he is not  obliged constantly to change. The feeling for the solidarity of the  arts was very strong with him. He practically abandoned writing for  the stage just after achieving his most noted success and merely for  the reason that in poetic narration, as he called it, he saw the  possibility of being still more dramatic. He felt hampered by the  restrictions which the necessarily limited length of an evening's  performance placed upon him, and wished more time and space for the  explanation of motives and the development of his plot. In his novel,  then, he clung to exactly the same arrangement of his theme as in his  drama--its initial presentation, the intensification of the interest,  the climax, the revulsion, the catastrophe. Again, in the matter of  contrast he deliberately followed the lead of the painter who knows  which colors are complementary and also which ones will clash.    [Illustration: GUSTAV FREYTAG. STAUFFER-BERN]    What, now, are some of the special qualities that have made  Freytag's literary work so enduring, so dear to the Teuton heart, so  successful in every sense of the word? For one thing, there are a  clearness, conciseness and elegance of style, joined to a sort of  musical rhythm, that hold one captive from the beginning. So evident  is his meaning in every sentence that his pages suffer less by  translation than is the case with almost any other author.    Freytag's highly polished sentences seem perfectly spontaneous, though  we know that he went through a long period of rigid training before  achieving success. \"For five years,\" he himself writes, \"I had pursued  the secret of dramatic style; like the child in the fairy-tale I had  sought it from the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. At length I had found  it: my soul could create securely and comfortably after the manner  which the stage itself demanded.\" He had found it, we are given to  understand, in part through the study of the French dramatists of his  own day of whom Scribe was one just then in vogue. From them, says a  critic, he learned \"lightness of touch, brevity, conciseness,  directness, the use of little traits as a means of giving insight into  character, different ways of keeping the interest at the proper point  of tension, and a thousand little devices for clearing the stage of  superfluous figures or making needed ones appear at the crucial  moment.\" Among his tricks of style, if we may call them so, are  inversion and elision; by the one he puts the emphasis just where he  wishes, by the other he hastens the action without sacrificing the  meaning. Another of his weapons is contrast--grave and gay, high and  low succeed each other rapidly, while vice and virtue follow suit.    No writer ever trained himself for his work more consciously and  consistently. He experimented with each play, watched its effect on  his audiences, asked himself seriously whether their apparent want of  interest in this or that portion was due to some defect in his work or  to their own obtuseness. He had failures, but remarkably few, and they  did not discourage him; nor did momentary success in one field  prevent him from abandoning it for another in which he hoped to  accomplish greater things. He is his own severest critic, and in his  autobiography speaks of certain productions as worthless which are  only relatively wanting in merit.    Freytag's orderly treatment of his themes affords constant pleasure to  the reader. He proceeds as steadily toward his climax as the builder  does toward the highest point of his roof. He had learned much about  climaxes, so he tells us himself, from Walter Scott, who was the first  to see the importance of a great final or concluding effect.    We have touched as yet merely on externals. Elegance of style,  orderliness of arrangement, consecutiveness of thought alone would  never have given Freytag his place in German literature. All these had  first to be consecrated to the service of a great idea. That idea as  expressed in _Debit and Credit_ is that the hope of the German nation  rests in its steady commercial or working class. He shows the dignity,  yes, the poetry of labor. The nation had failed to secure the needed  political reforms, to the bitter disappointment of numerous patriots;  Freytag's mission was to teach that there were other things worth  while besides these constitutional liberties of which men had so long  dreamed and for which they had so long struggled.    Incidentally he holds the decadent noble up to scorn, and shows how he  still clings to his old pretensions while their very basis is  crumbling under him. It is a new and active life that Freytag  advocates, one of toil and of routine, but one that in the end will  give the highest satisfaction. Such ideas were products of the  revolution of 1848, and they found the ground prepared for them by  that upheaval. Freytag, as Fichte had done in 1807 and 1808,  inaugurated a campaign of education which was to prove enormously  successful. A French critic writes of _Debit and Credit_ that it was  \"the breviary in which a whole generation of Germans learned to read  and to think,\" while an English translator (three translations of the  book appeared in England in the same year) calls it the _Uncle Tom's  Cabin_ of the German workingman. A German critic is furious that a  work of such real literary merit should be compared to one so flat and  insipid as Mrs. Stowe's production; but he altogether misses the  point, which is the effect on the people of a spirited defense of  those who had hitherto had no advocate.    Freytag has been called an opportunist, but the term should not be  considered one of reproach. It certainly was opportune that his great  work appeared at the moment when it was most needed, a moment of  discouragement, of disgust at everything high and low. It brought its  smiling message and remained to cheer and comfort. _The Journalists_,  too, was opportune, for it called attention to a class of men whose  work was as important as it was unappreciated. Up to 1848, the year of  the revolution, the press had been under such strict censorship that  any frank discussion of public matters had been out of the question.  But since then distinguished writers, like Freytag himself, had taken  the helm. Even when not radical, they were dreaded by the  reactionaries, and even Freytag escaped arrest in Prussia only by  hastily becoming a court official of his friend the Duke of  Saxe-Coburg and Gotha--within whose domains he already owned an estate  and was in the habit of residing for a portion of each year--and thus  renouncing his Prussian citizenship. Even Freytag's _Pictures from the  German Past_ may be said to have been opportune. Already, for a  generation, the new school of scientific historians--the Rankes, the  Wattenbachs, the Waitzs, the Giesebrechts--had been piling up their  discoveries, and collating and publishing manuscripts describing the  results of their labors. They lived on too high a plane for the  ordinary reader. Freytag did not attempt to \"popularize\" them by cheap  methods. He served as an interpreter between the two extremes. He  chose a type of facts that would have seemed trivial to the great  pathfinders, worked them up with care from the sources, and by his  literary art made them more than acceptable to the world at large. In  these _Pictures from the German Past_, as in the six volumes of the  series of historical romances entitled _The Ancestors_, a patriotic  purpose was not wanting. Freytag wished to show his Germans that they  had a history to be proud of, a history whose continuity was unbroken;  the nation had been through great vicissitudes, but everything had  tended to prove that the German has an inexhaustible fund of reserve  force. Certain national traits, certain legal institutions, could be  followed back almost to the dawn of history, and it would be found  that the Germans of the first centuries of our era were not nearly so  barbarous as had been supposed.    And so with a wonderful talent for selecting typical and essential  facts and not overburdening his narrative with detail he leads us down  the ages. The hero of his introductory romance in _The Ancestors_ is a  Vandal chieftain who settles among the Thuringians at the time of the  great wandering of the nations--the hero of the last of the series is  a journalist of the nineteenth century. All are descendants of the one  family, and Freytag has a chance to develop some of his theories of  heredity. Not only can bodily aptitudes and mental peculiarities be  transmitted, but also the tendency to act in a given case much as the  ancestor would have done.    It cannot be denied that as Freytag proceeds with _The Ancestors_ the  tendency to instruct and inform becomes too marked. He had begun his  career in the world by lecturing on literature at the University of  Breslau, but had severed his connection with that institution because  he was not allowed to branch out into history. Possibly those who  opposed him were right and the two subjects are incapable of  amalgamation.
