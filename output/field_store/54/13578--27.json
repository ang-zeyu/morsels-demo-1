Like criminals \"caught with the goods\" they stand,  self-convicted, dirty with the soot of a thousand chimneys, heavy with  the spoils of vanished civilizations; graft and greed stare at us out  of their glazed windows--eyes behind which no soul can be discerned.  There are doubtless extenuating circumstances; they want to be clean,  they want to be honest, these \"monsters of the mere market,\" but they  are nevertheless the unconscious victims of evils inherent in our  transitional social state.    Let us examine these strange creatures, doomed, it is hoped, to  extinction in favor of more intelligent and gracious forms of  life. They are big, powerful, \"necessitous,\" and have therefore an  impressiveness, even an aesthetic appeal, not to be denied. So subtle  and sensitive an old-world consciousness as that of M. Paul Bourget  was set vibrating by them like a violin to the concussion of a  trip-hammer, and to the following tune:        The portals of the basements, usually arched as if crushed      beneath the weight of the mountains which they support, look      like dens of a primitive race, continually receiving and      pouring forth a stream of people. You lift your eyes, and you      feel that up there behind the perpendicular wall, with      its innumerable windows, is a multitude coming and      going,--crowding the offices that perforate these cliffs of      brick and iron, dizzied with the speed of the elevators.      You divine, you feel the hot breath of speculation quivering      behind these windows. This it is which has fecundated these      thousands of square feet of earth, in order that from them may      spring up this appalling growth of business palaces, that hide      the sun from you and almost shut out the light of day.    \"The simple power of necessity is to a certain degree a principle of  beauty,\" says M. Bourget, and to these structures this order of beauty  cannot be denied, but even this is vitiated by a failure to press the  advantage home: the ornate facades are notably less impressive  than those whose grim and stark geometry is unmitigated by the  grave-clothes of dead styles. Instances there are of strivings toward  a beauty that is fresh and living, but they are so unsuccessful and  infrequent as to be negligible. However impressive these buildings may  be by reason of their ordered geometry, their weight and magnitude,  and as a manifestation of irrepressible power, they have the  unloveliness of things ignoble being the product neither of praise,  nor joy, nor worship, but enclosures for the transaction of sharp  bargains--gold bringing jinn of our modern Aladdins, who love them not  but only use them. That is the reason they are ugly; no one has loved  them for themselves alone.    For beauty is ever the very face of love. From the architecture of  a true democracy, founded on love and mutual service, beauty would  inevitably shine forth; its absence convicts us of a maladjustment in  our social and economic life. A skyscraper shouldering itself aloft at  the expense of its more humble neighbors, stealing their air and  their sunlight, is a symbol, written large against the sky, of  the will-to-power of a man or a group of men--of that ruthless and  tireless aggression on the part of the cunning and the strong so  characteristic of the period which produced the skyscraper. One of  our streets made up of buildings of diverse styles and shapes and  sizes--like a jaw with some teeth whole, some broken, some rotten,  and some gone--is a symbol of our unkempt individualism, now happily  becoming curbed and chastened by a common danger, a common devotion.    Some people hold the view that our insensitiveness to formal beauty is  no disgrace. Such argue that our accomplishments and our interests are  in other fields, where we more than match the accomplishments of older  civilizations. They forget that every achievement not registered in  terms of beauty has failed of its final and enduring transmutation. It  is because the achievements of older civilizations attained to their  apotheoses in art that they interest us, and unless we are able  to effect a corresponding transmutation we are destined to perish  unhonoured on our rubbish heap. That we shall effect it, through  knowledge and suffering, is certain, but before attempting the  more genial and rewarding task of tracing, in our life and in our  architecture, those forces and powers which make for righteousness,  for beauty, let us look our failures squarely in the face, and  discover if we can why they are failures.    Confining this examination to the particular matter under discussion,  the neo-feudal architecture of our city streets, we find it to lack  unity, and the reason for this lack of unity dwells in a _divided  consciousness_. The tall office building is the product of many  forces, or perhaps we should say one force, that of necessity; but its  concrete embodiment is the result of two different orders of talent,  that of the structural engineer and of the architectural designer.  These are usually incarnate in two different individuals, working  more or less at cross purposes. It is the business of the engineer  to preoccupy himself solely with ideas of efficiency and economy,  and over his efficient and economical structure the designer smears  a frosting of beauty in the form of architectural style, in the  archaeological sense. This is a foolish practice, and cannot but result  in failure. In the case of a Greek temple or a mediaeval cathedral  structure and style were not twain, but one; the structure determined  the style, the style expressed the structure; but with us so divorced  have the two things become that in a case known to the author, the  structural framework of a great office building was determined and  fabricated and then architects were invited to \"submit designs\"  for the exterior. This is of course an extreme example and does not  represent the usual practice, but it brings sharply to consciousness  the well known fact that for these buildings we have substantially one  method of construction--that of the vertical strut, and the horizontal  \"fill\"--while in style they appear as Grecian, Roman, Renaissance,  Gothic, Modern French and what not, according to the whim of the  designer.    [Illustration: PLATE II. THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY]    With the modern tendency toward specialization, the natural outgrowth  of necessity, there is no inherent reason why the bones of a building  should not be devised by one man and its fleshly clothing by another,  so long as they understand one another, and are in ideal agreement,  but there is in general all too little understanding, and a  confusion of ideas and aims. To the average structural engineer the  architectural designer is a mere milliner in stone, informed in those  prevailing architectural fashions of which he himself knows little and  cares less. Preoccupied as he is with the building's strength, safety,  economy; solving new and staggeringly difficult problems with address  and daring, he has scant sympathy with such inconsequent matters as  the stylistic purity of a facade, or the profile of a moulding. To the  designer, on the other hand, the engineer appears in the light of a  subordinate to be used for the promotion of his own ends, or an evil  to be endured as an interference with those ends.    As a result of this lack of sympathy and co-ordination, success crowns  only those efforts in which, on the one hand, the stylist has been  completely subordinated to engineering necessity, as in the case of  the East River bridges, where the architect was called upon only to  add a final grace to the strictly structural towers; or on the other  hand, in which the structure is of the old-fashioned masonry sort, and  faced with a familiar problem the architect has found it easy to be  frank; as in the case of the Manhattan Storage Warehouse, on 42nd  Street, New York, or in the Bryant Park facade on the New York  Library. The Woolworth building is a notable example of the complete  co-ordination between the structural framework and its envelope, and  falls short of ideal success only in the employment of an archaic and  alien ornamental language, used, however, let it be said, with a fine  understanding of the function of ornament.    For the most part though, there is a difference of intention between  the engineer and the designer; they look two ways, and the result of  their collaboration is a flat and confused image of the thing that  should be, not such as is produced by truly binocular vision. This  difference of aim is largely the result of a difference of education.  Engineering science of the sort which the use of steel has required is  a thing unprecedented; the engineer cannot hark back to the past for  help, even if he would. The case is different with the architectural  designer; he is taught that all of the best songs have been sung, all  of the true words spoken. The Glory that was Greece, and the Grandeur  that was Rome, the romantic exuberance of Gothic, and the ordered  restraint of Renaissance are so drummed into him during his years of  training, and exercise so tyrannical a spell over his imagination that  he loses the power of clear and logical thought, and never becomes  truly creative. Free of this incubus the engineer has succeeded in  being straightforward and sensible, to say the least; subject to it  the man with a so-called architectural education is too often tortuous  and absurd.    The architect without any training in the essentials of design  produces horrors as a matter of course, for the reason that sin is the  result of ignorance; the architect trained in the false manner of the  current schools becomes a reconstructive archaeologist, handicapped by  conditions with which he can deal only imperfectly, and imperfectly  control. Once in a blue moon a man arises who, with all the advantages  inherent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#2)"],[1,"to the  circumstance that he is born not merely in nature, but in the lap of a  society that is certain, reasonably certain, to lead him to its  traditions. Eliminate society and there is every reason to believe that  he will learn to walk, if, indeed, he survives at all. But it is just as  certain that he will never learn to talk, that is, to communicate ideas  according to the traditional system of a particular society. Or, again,  remove the new-born individual from the social environment into which he  has come and transplant him to an utterly alien one. He will develop the  art of walking in his new environment very much as he would have  developed it in the old. But his speech will be completely at variance  with the speech of his native environment. Walking, then, is a general  human activity that varies only within circumscribed limits as we pass  from individual to individual. Its variability is involuntary and  purposeless. Speech is a human activity that varies without assignable  limit as we pass from social group to social group, because it is a  purely historical heritage of the group, the product of long-continued  social usage. It varies as all creative effort varies--not as  consciously, perhaps, but none the less as truly as do the religions,  the beliefs, the customs, and the arts of different peoples. Walking is  an organic, an instinctive, function (not, of course, itself an  instinct); speech is a non-instinctive, acquired, \"cultural\" function.    There is one fact that has frequently tended to prevent the recognition  of language as a merely conventional system of sound symbols, that has  seduced the popular mind into attributing to it an instinctive basis  that it does not really possess. This is the well-known observation that  under the stress of emotion, say of a sudden twinge of pain or of  unbridled joy, we do involuntarily give utterance to sounds that the  hearer interprets as indicative of the emotion itself. But there is all  the difference in the world between such involuntary expression of  feeling and the normal type of communication of ideas that is speech.  The former kind of utterance is indeed instinctive, but it is  non-symbolic; in other words, the sound of pain or the sound of joy does  not, as such, indicate the emotion, it does not stand aloof, as it were,  and announce that such and such an emotion is being felt. What it does  is to serve as a more or less automatic overflow of the emotional  energy; in a sense, it is part and parcel of the emotion itself.  Moreover, such instinctive cries hardly constitute communication in any  strict sense. They are not addressed to any one, they are merely  overheard, if heard at all, as the bark of a dog, the sound of  approaching footsteps, or the rustling of the wind is heard. If they  convey certain ideas to the hearer, it is only in the very general sense  in which any and every sound or even any phenomenon in our environment  may be said to convey an idea to the perceiving mind. If the involuntary  cry of pain which is conventionally represented by \"Oh!\" be looked upon  as a true speech symbol equivalent to some such idea as \"I am in great  pain,\" it is just as allowable to interpret the appearance of clouds as  an equivalent symbol that carries the definite message \"It is likely to  rain.\" A definition of language, however, that is so extended as to  cover every type of inference becomes utterly meaningless.    The mistake must not be made of identifying our conventional  interjections (our oh! and ah! and sh!) with the instinctive cries  themselves. These interjections are merely conventional fixations of the  natural sounds. They therefore differ widely in various languages in  accordance with the specific phonetic genius of each of these. As such  they may be considered an integral portion of speech, in the properly  cultural sense of the term, being no more identical with the instinctive  cries themselves than such words as \"cuckoo\" and \"kill-deer\" are  identical with the cries of the birds they denote or than Rossini's  treatment of a storm in the overture to \"William Tell\" is in fact a  storm. In other words, the interjections and sound-imitative words of  normal speech are related to their natural prototypes as is art, a  purely social or cultural thing, to nature. It may be objected that,  though the interjections differ somewhat as we pass from language to  language, they do nevertheless offer striking family resemblances and  may therefore be looked upon as having grown up out of a common  instinctive base. But their case is nowise different from that, say, of  the varying national modes of pictorial representation. A Japanese  picture of a hill both differs from and resembles a typical modern  European painting of the same kind of hill. Both are suggested by and  both \"imitate\" the same natural feature. Neither the one nor the other  is the same thing as, or, in any intelligible sense, a direct outgrowth  of, this natural feature. The two modes of representation are not  identical because they proceed from differing historical traditions, are  executed with differing pictorial techniques. The interjections of  Japanese and English are, just so, suggested by a common natural  prototype, the instinctive cries, and are thus unavoidably suggestive of  each other. They differ, now greatly, now but little, because they are  builded out of historically diverse materials or techniques, the  respective linguistic traditions, phonetic systems, speech habits of the  two peoples. Yet the instinctive cries as such are practically identical  for all humanity, just as the human skeleton or nervous system is to all  intents and purposes a \"fixed,\" that is, an only slightly and  \"accidentally\" variable, feature of man's organism.    Interjections are among the least important of speech elements. Their  discussion is valuable mainly because it can be shown that even they,  avowedly the nearest of all language sounds to instinctive utterance,  are only superficially of an instinctive nature. Were it therefore  possible to demonstrate that the whole of language is traceable, in its  ultimate historical and psychological foundations, to the interjections,  it would still not follow that language is an instinctive activity. But,  as a matter of fact, all attempts so to explain the origin of speech  have been fruitless. There is no tangible evidence, historical or  otherwise, tending to show that the mass of speech elements and speech  processes has evolved out of the interjections. These are a very small  and functionally insignificant proportion of the vocabulary of language;  at no time and in no linguistic province that we have record of do we  see a noticeable tendency towards their elaboration into the primary  warp and woof of language. They are never more, at best, than a  decorative edging to the ample, complex fabric.    What applies to the interjections applies with even greater force to the  sound-imitative words. Such words as \"whippoorwill,\" \"to mew,\" \"to caw\"  are in no sense natural sounds that man has instinctively or  automatically reproduced. They are just as truly creations of the human  mind, flights of the human fancy, as anything else in language. They do  not directly grow out of nature, they are suggested by it and play with  it. Hence the onomatopoetic theory of the origin of speech, the theory  that would explain all speech as a gradual evolution from sounds of an  imitative character, really brings us no nearer to the instinctive level  than is language as we know it to-day. As to the theory itself, it is  scarcely more credible than its interjectional counterpart. It is true  that a number of words which we do not now feel to have a  sound-imitative value can be shown to have once had a phonetic form that  strongly suggests their origin as imitations of natural sounds. Such is  the English word \"to laugh.\" For all that, it is quite impossible to  show, nor does it seem intrinsically reasonable to suppose, that more  than a negligible proportion of the elements of speech or anything at  all of its formal apparatus is derivable from an onomatopoetic source.  However much we may be disposed on general principles to assign a  fundamental importance in the languages of primitive peoples to the  imitation of natural sounds, the actual fact of the matter is that these  languages show no particular preference for imitative words. Among the  most primitive peoples of aboriginal America, the Athabaskan tribes of  the Mackenzie River speak languages in which such words seem to be  nearly or entirely absent, while they are used freely enough in  languages as sophisticated as English and German. Such an instance shows  how little the essential nature of speech is concerned with the mere  imitation of things.    The way is now cleared for a serviceable definition of language.  Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating  ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a system of voluntarily  produced symbols. These symbols are, in the first instance, auditory and  they are produced by the so-called \"organs of speech.\" There is no  discernible instinctive basis in human speech as such, however much  instinctive expressions and the natural environment may serve as a  stimulus for the development of certain elements of speech, however much  instinctive tendencies, motor and other, may give a predetermined range  or mold to linguistic expression. Such human or animal communication, if  \"communication\" it may be called, as is brought about by involuntary,  instinctive cries is not, in our sense, language at all.    I have just referred to the \"organs of speech,\" and it would seem at  first blush that this is tantamount to an admission that speech itself  is an instinctive, biologically predetermined activity. We must not be  misled by the mere term. There are, properly speaking, no organs of"]]]
