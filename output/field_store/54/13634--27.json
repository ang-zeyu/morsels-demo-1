Sexual inversion, as here understood, means sexual instinct turned by  inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex. It is  thus a narrower term than homosexuality, which includes all sexual  attractions between persons of the same sex, even when seemingly due to  the accidental absence of the natural objects of sexual attraction, a  phenomenon of wide occurrence among all human races and among most of the  higher animals. It is only during recent years that sexual inversion has  been recognized; previously it was not distinguished from homosexuality in  general, and homosexuality was regarded as a national custom, as an  individual vice, or as an unimportant episode in grave forms of  insanity.[1] We have further to distinguish sexual inversion and all other  forms of homosexuality from another kind of inversion which usually  remains, so far as the sexual impulse itself is concerned, heterosexual,  that is to say, normal. Inversion of this kind leads a person to feel like  a person of the opposite sex, and to adopt, so far as possible, the  tastes, habits, and dress of the opposite sex, while the direction of the  sexual impulse remains normal. This condition I term sexo-esthetic  inversion, or Eonism.        The nomenclature of the highly important form of sexual      perversion with which we are here concerned is extremely varied,      and most investigators have been much puzzled in coming to a      conclusion as to the best, most exact, and at the same time most      colorless names to apply to it.        The first in the field in modern times was Ulrichs who, as early      as 1862, used the appellation \"Uranian\" (Uranier), based on the      well-known myth in Plato's _Banquet_. Later he Germanized this      term into \"Urning\" for the male, and \"Urningin\" for the female,      and referred to the condition itself as \"Urningtum.\" He also      invented a number of other related terms on the same basis; some      of these terms have had a considerable vogue, but they are too      fanciful and high-strung to secure general acceptance. If used in      other languages than German they certainly should not be used in      their Germanized shape, and it is scarcely legitimate to use the      term \"Urning\" in English. \"Uranian\" is more correct.        In Germany the first term accepted by recognized scientific      authorities was \"contrary sexual feeling\" (Kontraere      Sexualempfindung). It was devised by Westphal in 1869, and used      by Krafft-Ebing and Moll. Though thus accepted by the earliest      authorities in this field, and to be regarded as a fairly      harmless and vaguely descriptive term, it is somewhat awkward,      and is now little used in Germany; it was never currently used      outside Germany. It has been largely superseded by the term      \"homosexuality.\" This also was devised (by a little-known      Hungarian doctor, Benkert, who used the pseudonym Kertbeny) in      the same year (1869), but at first attracted no attention. It      has, philologically, the awkward disadvantage of being a bastard      term compounded of Greek and Latin elements, but its      significance--sexual attraction to the same sex--is fairly clear      and definite, while it is free from any question-begging      association of either favorable or unfavorable character. (Edward      Carpenter has proposed to remedy its bastardly linguistic      character by transforming it into \"homogenic;\" this, however,      might mean not only \"toward the same sex,\" but \"of the same      kind,\" and in German already possesses actually that meaning.)      The term \"homosexual\" has the further advantage that on account      of its classical origin it is easily translatable into many      languages. It is now the most widespread general term for the      phenomena we are dealing with, and it has been used by      Hirschfeld, now the chief authority in this field, as the title      of his encyclopedic work, _Die Homosexualitaet_.        \"Sexual Inversion\" (in French \"inversion sexuelle,\" and in      Italian \"inversione sessuale\") is the term which has from the      first been chiefly used in France and Italy, ever since Charcot      and Magnan, in 1882, published their cases of this anomaly in the      _Archives de Neurologie_. It had already been employed in Italy      by Tamassia in the _Revista Sperimentale di Freniatria_, in 1878.      I have not discovered when and where the term \"sexual inversion\"      was first used. Possibly it first appeared in English, for long      before the paper of Charcot and Magnan I have noticed, in an      anonymous review of Westphal's first paper in the _Journal of      Mental Science_ (then edited by Dr. Maudsley) for October, 1871,      that \"Contraere Sexualempfindung\" is translated as \"inverted      sexual proclivity.\" So far as I am aware, \"sexual inversion\" was      first used in English, as the best term, by J.A. Symonds in 1883,      in his privately printed essay, _A Problem in Greek Ethics_.      Later, in 1897, the same term was adopted, I believe for the      first time publicly in English, in the present work.        It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous other names which have      been proposed. (A discussion of the nomenclature will be found in      the first chapter of Hirschfeld's work, _Die Homosexualitaet_, and      of some special terms in an article by Schouten,      _Sexual-Probleme_, December, 1912.) It may suffice to mention the      ancient theological and legal term \"sodomy\" (sodomia) because it      is still the most popular term for this perversion, though, it      must be remembered, it has become attached to the physical act of      intercourse _per anum_, even when carried out heterosexually, and      has little reference to psychic sexual proclivity. This term has      its origin in the story (narrated in Genesis, ch. xix) of Lot's      visitors whom the men of Sodom desired to have intercourse with,      and of the subsequent destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This      story furnishes a sufficiently good ground for the use of the      term, though the Jews do not regard sodomy as the sin of Sodom,      but rather inhospitality and hardness of heart to the poor (J.      Preuss, _Biblisch-Talmudische Medizin_, pp. 579-81), and      Christian theologians also, both Catholic and Protestant (see,      e.g., _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. iv, p. 199,      and Hirschfeld, _Homosexualitaet_, p. 742), have argued that it      was not homosexuality, but their other offenses, which provoked      the destruction of the Cities of the Plain. In Germany \"sodomy\"      has long been used to denote bestiality, or sexual intercourse      with animals, but this use of the term is quite unjustified. In      English there is another term, \"buggery,\" identical in meaning      with sodomy, and equally familiar. \"Bugger\" (in French,      _bougre_) is a corruption of \"Bulgar,\" the ancient Bulgarian      heretics having been popularly supposed to practise this      perversion. The people of every country have always been eager to      associate sexual perversions with some other country than their      own.        The terms usually adopted in the present volume are \"sexual      inversion\" and \"homosexuality.\" The first is used more especially      to indicate that the sexual impulse is organically and innately      turned toward individuals of the same sex. The second is used      more comprehensively of the general phenomena of sexual      attraction between persons of the same sex, even if only of a      slight and temporary character. It may be admitted that there is      no precise warrant for any distinction of this kind between the      two terms. The distinction in the phenomena is, however, still      generally recognized; thus Iwan Bloch applies the term      \"homosexuality\" to the congenital form, and      \"pseudo-homosexuality\" to its spurious or simulated forms. Those      persons who are attracted to both sexes are now usually termed      \"bisexual,\" a more convenient term than \"psycho-sexual      hermaphrodite,\" which was formerly used. There remains the normal      person, who is \"heterosexual.\"    Before approaching the study of sexual inversion in cases which we may  investigate with some degree of scientific accuracy, there is interest in  glancing briefly at the phenomena as they appear before us, as yet  scarcely or at all differentiated, among animals, among various human  races, and at various periods.    Among animals in a domesticated or confined state it is easy to find  evidence of homosexual attraction, due merely to the absence of the other  sex.[2] This was known to the ancients; the Egyptians regarded two male  partridges as the symbol of homosexuality, and Aristotle noted that two  female pigeons would cover each other if no male was at hand. Buffon  observed many examples, especially among birds. He found that, if male or  female birds of various species--such as partridges, fowls, and  doves--were shut up together, they would soon begin to have sexual  relations among themselves, the males sooner and more frequently than the  females. More recently Sainte-Claire Deville observed that dogs, rams, and  bulls, when isolated, first became restless and dangerous, and then  acquired a permanent state of sexual excitement, not obeying the laws of  heat, and leading them to attempts to couple together; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#2)"],[1,"henomena--The Part Played by Respiratory Excitement in the Process of  Courtship--Swinging and Suspension--The Attraction Exerted by the Idea of  being Chained and Fettered.

The term \"sexual instinct\" may be said to cover the whole of the  neuropsychic phenomena of reproduction which man shares with the lower  animals. It is true that much discussion has taken place concerning the  proper use of the term \"instinct,\" and some definitions of instinctive  action would appear to exclude the essential mechanism of the process  whereby sexual reproduction is assured. Such definitions scarcely seem  legitimate, and are certainly unfortunate. Herbert Spencer's definition of  instinct as \"compound reflex action\" is sufficiently clear and definite  for ordinary use.        A fairly satisfactory definition of instinct is that supplied by      Dr. and Mrs. Peckham in the course of their study _On the      Instincts and Habits of Solitary Wasps_. \"Under the term      'instinct,'\" they say, \"we place all complex acts which are      performed previous to experience and in a similar manner by all      members of the same sex and race, leaving out as non-essential,      at this time, the question of whether they are or are not      accompanied by consciousness.\" This definition is quoted with      approval by Lloyd Morgan, who modifies and further elaborates it      (_Animal Behavior_, 1900, p. 21). \"The distinction between      instinctive and reflex behavior,\" he remarks, \"turns in large      degree on their relative complexity,\" and instinctive behavior,      he concludes, may be said to comprise \"those complex groups of      co-ordinated acts which are, on their first occurrence,      independent of experience; which tend to the well-being of the      individual and the preservation of the race; which are due to the      co-operation of external and internal stimuli; which are      similarly performed by all the members of the same more or less      restricted group of animals; but which are subject to variation,      and to subsequent modification under the guidance of experience.\"      Such a definition clearly justifies us in speaking of a \"sexual      instinct.\" It may be added that the various questions involved in      the definition of the sexual instinct have been fully discussed      by Moll in the early sections of his _Untersuchungen ueber die      Libido Sexualis_.        Of recent years there has been a tendency to avoid the use of the      term \"instinct,\" or, at all events, to refrain from attaching any      serious scientific sense to it. Loeb's influence has especially      given force to this tendency. Thus, while Pieron, in an      interesting discussion of the question (\"Les Problemes Actuels de      l'Instinct,\" _Revue Philosophique_, Oct., 1908), thinks it would      still be convenient to retain the term, giving it a philosophical      meaning, Georges Bohn, who devotes a chapter to the notion of      instinct (_La Naissance de l'Intelligence_, 1909), is strongly in      favor of eliminating the word, as being merely a legacy of      medieval theologians and metaphysicians, serving to conceal our      ignorance or our lack of exact analysis.    It may be said that the whole of the task undertaken in these _Studies_ is  really an attempt to analyze what is commonly called the sexual instinct.  In order to grasp it we have to break it up into its component parts.  Lloyd Morgan has pointed out that the components of an instinct may be  regarded as four: first, the internal messages giving rise to the impulse;  secondly, the external stimuli which co-operate with the impulse to affect  the nervous centers; thirdly, the active response due to the co-ordinate  outgoing discharges; and, fourthly, the message from the organs concerned  in the behavior by which the central nervous system is further  affected.[1]    In dealing with the sexual instinct the first two factors are those which  we have most fully to discuss. With the external stimuli we shall be  concerned in a future volume (IV). We may here confine ourselves mainly to  the first factor: the nature of the internal messages which prompt the  sexual act. We may, in other words, attempt to analyze the _sexual  impulse_.    The first definition of the sexual impulse we meet with is that which  regards it as an impulse of evacuation. The psychological element is thus  reduced to a minimum. It is true that, especially in early life, the  emotions caused by forced repression of the excretions are frequently  massive or acute in the highest degree, and the joy of relief  correspondingly great. But in adult life, on most occasions, these desires  can be largely pushed into the background of consciousness, partly by  training, partly by the fact that involuntary muscular activity is less  imperative in adult life; so that the ideal element in connection with the  ordinary excretions is almost a negligible quantity. The evacuation theory  of the sexual instinct is, however, that which has most popular vogue, and  the cynic delights to express it in crude language. It is the view that  appeals to the criminal mind, and in the slang of French criminals the  brothel is _le cloaque_. It was also the view implicitly accepted by  medieval ascetic writers, who regarded woman as \"a temple built over a  sewer,\" and from a very different standpoint it was concisely set forth by  Montaigne, who has doubtless contributed greatly to support this view of  the matter: \"I find,\" he said, \"that Venus, after all, is nothing more  than the pleasure of discharging our vessels, just as nature renders  pleasurable the discharges from other parts.\"[2] Luther, again, always  compared the sexual to the excretory impulse, and said that marriage was  just as necessary as the emission of urine. Sir Thomas More, also, in the  second book of _Utopia_, referring to the pleasure of evacuation, speaks  of that felt \"when we do our natural easement, or when we be doing the act  of generation.\" This view would, however, scarcely deserve"]]]
