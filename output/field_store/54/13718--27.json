From the point of view of  legends, the apocryphal books are of subordinate importance,  while the pseudepigrapha are of fundamental value. Even  quantitatively the latter are an imposing mass. Besides the Greek  writings of the Hellenist Jews, they contain Latin, Syrian,  Ethiopic, Aramean, Arabic, Persian, and Old Slavic products  translated directly or indirectly from Jewish works of  Palestinian or Hellenistic origin. The use of these  pseudepigrapha requires great caution. Nearly all of them are  embellished with Christian interpolations, and in some cases the  inserted portions have choked the original form so completely  that it is impossible to determine at first sight whether a  Jewish or a Christian legend is under examination. I believe,  however, that the pseudepigraphic material made use of by me is  Jewish beyond the cavil of a doubt, and therefore it could not  have been left out of account in a work like the present.    However, in the appreciation of Jewish Legends, it is the  Rabbinic writers that should form the point of departure, and not  the pseudepigrapha. The former represent the main stream of  Jewish thought and feeling, the latter only an undercurrent. If  the Synagogue cast out the pseudepigrapha, and the Church adopted  them with a great show of favor, these respective attitudes were  not determined arbitrarily or by chance. The pseudepigrapha  originated in circles that harbored the germs from which  Christianity developed later on. The Church could thus  appropriate them as her own with just reason.    In the use of some of the apocryphal and pseudepigraphic  writings, I found it expedient to quote the English translations  of them made by others, in so far as they could be brought into  accord with the general style of the book, for which purpose I  permitted myself the liberty of slight verbal changes. In  particulars, I was guided, naturally, by my own conception of the  subject, which the Notes justify in detail.    Besides the pseudepigrapha there are other Jewish sources in  Christian garb. In the rich literature of the Church Fathers many  a Jewish legend lies embalmed which one would seek in vain in  Jewish books. It was therefore my special concern to use the  writings of the Fathers to the utmost.    The luxuriant abundance of the material to be presented made it  impossible to give a verbal rendition of each legend. This would  have required more than three times the space at my disposal. I  can therefore claim completeness for my work only as to content.  In form it had to suffer curtailment. When several conflicting  versions of the same legend existed, I gave only one in the text,  reserving the other one, or the several others, for the Notes,  or, when practicable, they were fused into one typical legend,  the component parts of which are analyzed in the Notes. In other  instances I resorted to the expedient of citing one version in  one place and the others in other appropriate places, in  furtherance of my aim, to give a smooth presentation of the  matter, with as few interruptions to the course of the narrative  as possible. For this reason I avoided such transitional phrases  as \"Some say,\" \"It has been maintained,\" etc. That my method  sometimes separates things that belong together cannot be  considered a grave disadvantage, as the Index at the end of the  work will present a logical rearrangement of the material for the  benefit of the interested student. I also did not hesitate to  treat of the same personage in different chapters, as, for  instance, many of the legends bearing upon Jacob, those connected  with the latter years of the Patriarch, do not appear in the  chapter bearing his name, but will be found in the sections  devoted to Joseph, for the reason that once the son steps upon  the scene, he becomes the central figure, to which the life and  deeds of the father are subordinated. Again, in consideration of  lack of space the Biblical narratives underlying the legends had  to be omitted--surely not a serious omission in a subject with  which widespread acquaintance may be presupposed as a matter of  course.    As a third consequence of the amplitude of the material, it was  thought advisable to divide it into several volumes. The  references, the explanations of the sources used, and the  interpretations given, and, especially, numerous emendations of  the text of the Midrashim and the pseudepigrapha, which  determined my conception of the passages so emended, will be  found in the last volume, the fourth, which will contain also an  Introduction to the History of Jewish Legends, a number of  Excursuses, and the Index.    As the first three volumes are in the hands of the printer almost  in their entirety, I venture to express the hope that the whole  work will appear within measurable time, the parts following each  other at short intervals.

I    THE CREATION OF THE WORLD  THE FIRST THINGS CREATED  THE ALPHABET  THE FIRST DAY  THE SECOND DAY  THE THIRD DAY  THE FOURTH DAY  THE FIFTH DAY  THE SIXTH DAY  ALL THINGS PRAISE THE LORD        I    THE CREATION OF THE WORLD    THE FIRST THINGS CREATED    In the beginning, two thousand years before the heaven and the  earth, seven things were created: the Torah written with black  fire on white fire, and lying in the lap of God; the Divine  Throne, erected in the heaven which later was over the heads of  the Hayyot; Paradise on the right side of God, Hell on the left  side; the Celestial Sanctuary directly in front of God, having a  jewel on its altar graven with the Name of the Messiah, and a  Voice that cries aloud, \"Return, ye children of men.\"[1]    When God resolved upon the creation of the world, He took counsel  with the Torah.[2] Her advice was this: \"O Lord, a king without  an army and without courtiers and attendants hardly deserves the  name of king, for none is nigh to express the homage due to him.\"  The answer pleased God exceedingly. Thus did He teach all earthly  kings, by His Divine example, to undertake naught without first  consulting advisers.[3]    The advice of the Torah was given with some reservations. She was  skeptical about the value of an earthly world, on account of the  sinfulness of men, who would be sure to disregard her precepts.  But God dispelled her doubts. He told her, that repentance had  been created long before, and sinners would have the opportunity  of mending their ways. Besides, the Temple service would be  invested with atoning power, and Paradise and hell were intended  to do duty as reward and punishment. Finally, the Messiah was  appointed to bring salvation, which would put an end to all  sinfulness.[4]    Nor is this world inhabited by man the first of things earthly  created by God. He made several worlds before ours, but He  destroyed them all, because He was pleased with none until He  created ours.[5] But even this last world would have had no  permanence, if God had executed His original plan of ruling it  according to the principle of strict justice. It was only when He  saw that justice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"crime against Joseph, they  yet observed all the rules and prescriptions of the ritual in  slaughtering the kid of the goats with the blood of which  they besmeared his coat of many colors.[8]      JOSEPH HATED BY HIS BRETHREN    Joseph's talebearing against his brethren made them hate  him. Among all of them Gad was particularly wrathful,  and for good reason. Gad was a very brave man, and when  a beast of prey attacked the herd, over which he kept guard  at night, he would seize it by one of its legs, and whirl it  around until it was stunned, and then he would fling it away  to a distance of two stadia, and kill it thus. Once Jacob  sent Joseph to tend the flock, but he remained away only  thirty days, for he was a delicate lad and fell sick with the  heat, and he hastened back to his father. On his return he  told Jacob that the sons of the handmaids were in the habit  of slaughtering the choice cattle of the herd and eating it,  without obtaining permission from Judah and Reuben. But  his report was not accurate. What he had seen was Gad  slaughtering one lamb, which he had snatched from the very  jaws of a bear, and he killed it because it could not be kept  alive after its fright. Joseph's account sounded as though  the sons of the handmaids were habitually inconsiderate and  careless in wasting their father's substance.[9]    To the resentment of the brethren was added their envy  of Joseph, because their father loved him more than all of  them. Joseph's beauty of person was equal to that of his  mother Rachel, and Jacob had but to look at him to be consoled  for the death of his beloved wife. Reason enough for  distinguishing him among his children.[10] As a token of his  great love for him, Jacob gave Joseph a coat of many colors,  so light and delicate that it could be crushed and concealed  in the closed palm of one hand. The Hebrew name of the  garment, Passim, conveys the story of the sale of Joseph.  The first letter, Pe, stands for Potiphar, his Egyptian master;  Samek stands for Soharim, the merchantmen that  bought Joseph from the company of Ishmaelites to whom his  brethren had sold him; Yod stands for these same Ishmaelites;  and Mem, for the Midianites that obtained him from  the merchantmen, and then disposed of him to Potiphar.  But Passim. has yet another meaning, \"clefts.\" His brethren  knew that the Red Sea would be cleft in twain in days to  come for Joseph's sake, and they were jealous of the glory  to be conferred upon him. Although they were filled with  hatred of him, it must be said in their favor that they were  not of a sullen, spiteful nature. They did not hide their  feelings,  they proclaimed their enmity openly.    Once Joseph dreamed a dream, and he could not refrain  from telling it to his brethren. He spoke, and said: \"Hear,  I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed. Behold, you  gathered fruit, and so did I. Your fruit rotted, but mine  remained sound. Your seed will set up dumb images of  idols, but they will vanish at the appearance of my descendant,  the Messiah of Joseph. You will keep the truth as to  my fate from the knowledge of my father, but I will stand  fast as a reward for the self-denial of my mother, and you  will prostrate yourselves five times before me.\"[11]    The brethren refused at first to listen to the dream, but  when Joseph urged them again and again, they gave heed  to him, and they said, \"Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or  shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?\"[12] God put an  interpretation into their mouths that was to be verified in  the posterity of Joseph. Jeroboam and Jehu, two kings,  and Joshua and Gideon, two judges, have been among his  descendants, corresponding to the double and emphatic expressions  used by his brethren in interpreting the dream.[13]    Then Joseph dreamed another dream, how the sun, the  moon, and eleven stars bowed down before him, and Jacob,  to whom he told it first, was rejoiced over it, for he understood  its meaning properly.[14] He knew that he himself was  designated by the sun, the name by which God had called  him when he lodged overnight on the holy site of the  Temple. He had heard God say to the angels at that time,  \"The sun has come.\"[15] The moon stood for Joseph's  mother, and the stars for his brethren, for the righteous are  as the stars.[16] Jacob was so convinced of the truth of  the dream that he was encouraged to believe that he  would live to see the resurrection of the dead, for Rachel  was dead, and her return to earth was clearly indicated by  the dream. He went astray there, for not Joseph's own  mother was referred to, but his foster-mother Bilhah, who  had raised him.    Jacob wrote the dream in a book, recording all the circumstances,  the day, the hour, and the place, for the holy spirit  cautioned him, \"Take heed, these things will surely come  to pass.\"[17] But when Joseph repeated his dream to his  brethren, in the presence of his father, Jacob rebuked him,  saying, \"I and thy brethren, that has some sense, but I and  thy mother, that is inconceivable, for thy mother is dead.\"[18]  These words of Jacob called forth a reproof from God. He  said, \"Thus thy descendants will in time to come seek to  hinder Jeremiah in delivering his prophecies.\"[19] Jacob may  be excused, he had spoken in this way only in order to avert  the envy and hate of his brethren from Joseph, but they  envied and hated him because they knew that the interpretation  put upon the dream by Jacob would be realized.[20]      JOSEPH CAST INTO THE PIT    Once the brethren of Joseph led their father's flocks to  the pastures of Shechem, and they intended to take their  ease and pleasure there.[21] They stayed away a long time, and  no tidings of them were heard. Jacob began to be anxious  about the fate of his sons. He feared that a war had broken  out between them and the people of Shechem, and he resolved  to send Joseph to them and have him bring word  again, whether it was well with his brethren.[22] Jacob desired  to know also about the flocks, for it is a duty to concern  oneself about the welfare of anything from which one derives  profit. Though he knew that the hatred of his brethren  might bring on unpleasant adventures, yet Joseph, in  filial reverence, declared himself ready to go on his father's  errand. Later, whenever Jacob remembered his dear son's  willing spirit, the recollection stabbed him to the heart. He  would say to himself, \"Thou didst know the hatred of thy  brethren, and yet thou didst say, Here am I.\"[23]    Jacob dismissed Joseph, with the injunction that he journey  only by daylight,[24] saying furthermore, \"Go now, see  whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flock;  and send me word\"--an unconscious prophecy. He did not  say that he expected to see Joseph again, but only to have  word from him.[25] Since the covenant of the pieces, God  had resolved, on account of Abraham's doubting question,  that Jacob and his family should go down into Egypt to  dwell there. The preference shown to Joseph by his father,  and the envy it aroused, leading finally to the sale of Joseph  and his establishment in Egypt, were but disguised means  created by God, instead of executing His counsel directly  by carrying Jacob down into Egypt as a captive.[26]    Joseph reached Shechem, where he expected to find his  brethren. Shechem was always a place of ill omen for  Jacob and his seed--there Dinah was dishonored, there the  Ten Tribes of Israel rebelled against the house of David  while Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem, and there Jeroboam  was installed as king.[27] Not finding his brethren and the  herd in Shechem, Joseph continued his journey in the direction  of the next pasturing place, not far from Shechem, but  he lost his way in the wilderness.[28] Gabriel in human shape  appeared before him, and asked him, saying, \"What seekest  thou?\"[29] And he answered, \"I seek my brethren.\"  Whereto the angel replied, \"Thy brethren have given up  the Divine qualities of love and mercy.[30] Through a prophetic  revelation they learned that the Hivites were preparing  to make war upon them, and therefore they departed  hence to go to Dothan. And they had to leave this place for  other reasons, too. I heard, while I was still standing behind  the curtain that veils the Divine throne, that this day  the Egyptian bondage would begin, and thou wouldst be  the first to be subjected to it.\"[31] Then Gabriel led Joseph to  Dothan.[32]    When his brethren saw him afar off, they conspired  against him, to slay him. Their first plan was to set dogs  on him. Simon then spoke to Levi, \"Behold, the master of  dreams cometh with a new dream, he whose descendant  Jeroboam will introduce the worship of Baal. Come now,  therefore, and let us slay him, that we may see what will  become of his dreams.\" But God spoke: \"Ye say, We shall  see what will become of his dreams, and I say likewise, We  shall see, and the future shall show whose word will stand,  yours or Mine.\"[33]    Simon and Gad set about slaying Joseph, and he fell upon  his face, and entreated them: \"Have mercy with me, my  brethren, have pity on the heart of my father Jacob. Lay  not your hands upon me, to spill innocent blood, for I have  done no evil unto you. But if I have done evil unto you,  then chastise me with a chastisement, but your hands lay  not upon me, for the sake of our father Jacob.\" These  words touched Zebulon, and he began to lament and weep,  and the wailing of Joseph rose up together with his brother's,  and when Simon and Gad raised their hands against  him to execute their evil design, Joseph took refuge behind  Zebulon, and supplicated his other brethren to have mercy  upon him. Then Reuben arose, and he said, \"Brethren, let  us not slay him, but let us cast him into one of the dry pits,  which our fathers dug without finding water.\" That was  due to the providence of God; He had hindered the water  from rising in "]]]
