James White has two dogs. One is a Newfoundland dog, and the other is a  Scotch terrier.    2. The Newfoundland is a large, noble fellow. He is black, with a white  spot, and with long, shaggy hair. His name is Sport.    3. Sport is a good watchdog, and a kind playfellow. Every night he guards  the house while James and his father are asleep.    4. In the daytime, James often uses Sport for his horse. He has a little  wagon, and a set of small harness which just fits the dog.    5. He hitches Sport to this wagon, and drives over the country. In this  way, he can go almost as fast as his father with the old family horse.    6. The name of James's Scotch terrier is Dodger. He is called Dodger  because he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table,  behind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard,--all in a minute.    7. Dodger has very bright eyes, and he does many funny things. He likes to  put his paws up on the crib, and watch the baby.    8. The other day he took baby's red stocking, and had great fun with it;  but he spoiled it in his play, and James had to scold him.    9. Everyone likes to see James White with his two dogs. They always seem  very happy together.

Puss, with her three kittens, had lived in the coal cellar; but one day  she thought she would carry them to the attic.    2. The servant thought that was not the proper place for them; so she  carried them back to the cellar.    3. Puss was certain that she wanted them in the attic; so she carried them  there again and again, five, six, seven, --yes, a dozen times; for each  time the servant took them back to the cellar.    4. Poor puss was nearly tired out, and could carry them no longer.    5. Suddenly she went away. Where do you think she went?    6. She was gone a long time. When she returned, she had a strange cat with  her that we had never seen before.    7. She seemed to tell him all about her great trouble, and he listened to  her story.    8. Then the strange cat took the little kittens, one by one, and carried  them to the attic. After this he went away, and we have never seen him  since.    9. The servant then left the kittens in the attic, for she saw how anxious  puss was to have them stay there.    10. Was not the strange cat kind to puss?

Once there was a little kitty,       White as the snow;     In a barn he used to frolic,       Long time ago.    2. In the barn a little mousie       Ran to and fro;     For she heard the little kitty,       Long time ago.    3. Two black eyes had little kitty,       Black as a crow;     And they spied the little mousie,       Long time ago.    4. Four soft paws had little kitty,       Paws soft as snow;     And they caught the little mousie,       Long time ago.    5. Nine pearl teeth had little kitty,       All in a row;     And they bit the little mousie,       Long time ago.    6. When the teeth bit little mousie,       Mousie cried out \"Oh!\"     But she slipped away from kitty,       Long time ago.

After play, we  should be glad to work.    2. I knew a boy who liked a good game very much. He could run, swim, jump,  and play ball; and was always merry when out of school.    3. But he knew that time is not all for play; that our minutes, hours, and  days are very precious.    4. At the end of his play, he would go home. After he had washed his face  and hands, and brushed his hair, he would help his mother, or read in his  book, or write upon his slate.    5. He used to say, \"One thing at a time.\" When he had done with work, he  would play; but he did not try to play and to work at the same time.

To summon a dead religion from its forgotten grave and to make it tell  its story, would require an enchanter's wand. Other old faiths, of  Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, are known to us. But in their case  liturgies, myths, theogonies, theologies, and the accessories of cult,  remain to yield their report of the outward form of human belief and  aspiration. How scanty, on the other hand, are the records of Celtic  religion! The bygone faith of a people who have inspired the world with  noble dreams must be constructed painfully, and often in fear and  trembling, out of fragmentary and, in many cases, transformed remains.    We have the surface observations of classical observers, dedications in  the Romano-Celtic area to gods mostly assimilated to the gods of the  conquerors, figured monuments mainly of the same period, coins, symbols,  place and personal names. For the Irish Celts there is a mass of written  material found mainly in eleventh and twelfth century MSS. Much of this,  in spite of alteration and excision, is based on divine and heroic  myths, and it also contains occasional notices of ritual. From Wales  come documents like the _Mabinogion_, and strange poems the personages  of which are ancient gods transformed, but which tell nothing of rite or  cult.[2] Valuable hints are furnished by early ecclesiastical documents,  but more important is existing folk-custom, which preserves so much of  the old cult, though it has lost its meaning to those who now use it.  Folk-tales may also be inquired of, if we discriminate between what in  them is Celtic and what is universal. Lastly, Celtic burial-mounds and  other remains yield their testimony to ancient belief and custom.    From these sources we try to rebuild Celtic paganism and to guess at its  inner spirit, though we are working in the twilight on a heap of  fragments. No Celt has left us a record of his faith and practice, and  the unwritten poems of the Druids died with them. Yet from these  fragments we see the Celt as the seeker after God, linking himself by  strong ties to the unseen, and eager to conquer the unknown by religious  rite or magic art. For the things of the spirit have never appealed in  vain to the Celtic soul, and long ago classical observers were struck  with the religiosity of the Celts. They neither forgot nor transgressed  the law of the gods, and they thought that no good befell men apart from  their will.[3] The submission of the Celts to the Druids shows how they  welcomed authority in matters of religion, and all Celtic regions have  been characterised by religious devotion, easily passing over to  superstition, and by loyalty to ideals and lost causes. The Celts were  born dreamers, as their exquisite Elysium belief will show, and much  that is spiritual and romantic in more than one European literature is  due to them.    The analogy of religious evolution in other faiths helps us in  reconstructing that of the Celts. Though no historic Celtic group was  racially pure, the profound influence of the Celtic temperament soon  \"Celticised\" the religious contributions of the non-Celtic element which  may already have had many Celtic parallels. Because a given Celtic rite  or belief seems to be \"un-Aryan,\" it need not necessarily be borrowed.  The Celts had a savage past, and, conservative as they were, they kept  much of it alive. Our business, therefore, lies with Celtic religion as  a whole. These primitive elements were there before the Celts migrated  from the old \"Aryan\" home; yet since they appear in Celtic religion to  the end, we speak of them as Celtic. The earliest aspect of that  religion, before the Celts became a separate people, was a cult of  nature spirits, or of the life manifested in nature. But men and women  probably had separate cults, and, of the two, perhaps that of the latter  is more important. As hunters, men worshipped the animals they slew,  apologising to them for the slaughter. This apologetic attitude, found  with all primitive hunters, is of the nature of a cult. Other animals,  too sacred to be slain, would be preserved and worshipped, the cult  giving rise to domestication and pastoral life, with totemism as a  probable factor. Earth, producing vegetation, was the fruitful mother;  but since the origin of agriculture is mainly due to women, the Earth  cult would be practised by them, as well as, later, that of vegetation  and corn spirits, all regarded as female. As men began to interest  themselves in agriculture, they would join in the female cults, probably  with the result of changing the sex of the spirits worshipped. An  Earth-god would take the place of the Earth-mother, or stand as her  consort or son. Vegetation and corn spirits would often become male,  though many spirits, even when they were exalted into divinities,  remained female.    With the growth of religion the vaguer spirits tended to become gods and  goddesses, and worshipful animals to become anthropomorphic divinities,  with the animals as their symbols, attendants, or victims. And as the  cult of vegetation spirits centred in the ritual of planting and sowing,  so the cult of the divinities of growth centred in great seasonal and  agricultural festivals, in which the key to the growth of Celtic  religion is to be found. But the migrating Celts, conquering new lands,  evolved divinities of war; and here the old female influence is still at  work, since many of these are female. In spite of possessing so many  local war-gods, the Celts were not merely men of war. Even the _equites_  engaged in war only when occasion arose, and agriculture as well as  pastoral industry was constantly practised, both in Gaul and Britain,  before the conquest.[4] In Ireland, the belief in the dependence of  fruitfulness upon the king, shows to what extent agriculture flourished  there.[5] Music, poetry, crafts, and trade gave rise to culture  divinities, perhaps evolved from gods of growth, since later myths  attributed to them both the origin of arts and crafts, and the  introduction of domestic animals among men. Possibly some culture gods  had been worshipful animals, now worshipped as gods, who had given these  animals to man. Culture-goddesses still held their place among  culture-gods, and were regarded as their mothers. The prominence of  these divinities shows that the Celts were more than a race of warriors.    The pantheon was thus a large one, but on the whole the divinities of  growth were more generally important. The older nature spirits and  divine animals were never quite forgotten, especially by the folk, who  also preserved the old rituals of vegetation spirits, while the gods of  growth were worshipped at the great festivals. Yet in essence the lower  and the higher cults were one and the same, and, save where Roman  influence destroyed Celtic religion, the older primitive strands are  everywhere apparent. The temperament of the Celt kept him close to  nature, and he never quite dropped the primitive elements of his  religion. Moreover, the early influence of female cults of female  spirits and goddesses remained to the end as another predominant factor.    Most of the Celtic divinities were local in character, each tribe  possessing its own group, each god having functions similar to those of  other groups. Some, however, had"]]]
