The Paris societies had got full possession of the field of  literature, and erected their tribunals before the middle of the  century, whilst at Versailles nothing was spoken or thought of except  amusements and hunting, Jesuits and processions, and the grossest  sensuality prevailed. The members of the Parisian societies were not a  whit more moral or decent in their behavior than those about the court  at Versailles, but they carried on open war against hypocrisy, and all  that was praised and approved of by the court.    We shall now proceed to mention three or four of the most  distinguished of those societies, which have obtained an historical  importance, not merely for the French literature and mental and moral  culture of the eighteenth century, but for Europe in general, without  however restraining ourselves precisely within the limits of the half  century. The minute accounts which Grimm has given, for the most part  affect only the later periods; we turn our attention therefore the  rather to what the weak, vain, talkative Marmontel has related to us  on the subject in his 'Autobiography,' because Rousseau was by far  too one-sided in his notices, and drew public attention to the most  demoralized and degraded members of the circle only.    The first lady who must be mentioned, is Madame de Tencin. She  belonged to the period within which we must confine ourselves, and she  gained for herself such a name, not only in Paris, but in all Europe,  that she was almost regarded as the creator of that new literature  which stood in direct and bold opposition to the prevailing taste,  inasmuch as she received at her house, entertained and cherished,  those who were really its originators and supporters. This lady could  not boast of the morality of her early years, nor of her respect even  for common propriety. She is not only notorious for having exposed,  when a child, the celebrated D'Alembert, who was her natural son, and  for regarding with indifference his being brought up by the wife of a  common glazier as her own son; but stories still worse than even these  are told of her. She enriched herself, as many others did, in the time  of Law's scheme, by no very creditable means; and fell under such a  serious suspicion of having been privy to the death of one of those  who had carried on an intrigue with her, that she was imprisoned  and involved in a criminal prosecution, from which she escaped, not  through her own innocence, but by means of the powerful influence of  her distinguished relations and friends.    All this did not prevent Pope Benedict XIV., who, as Cardinal  Lambertini, had been often at her house, as a member of the society of  men of talents who met there, from carrying on a continual intercourse  with her by letter; he also sent her his picture as a testimony of  kind remembrance. This lady succeeded in procuring for her brother the  dignity of a cardinal, and through him had great weight with Fleury,  with the court, and with the city in general; she is also known as  an authoress. As we are not writing a history of literature properly  speaking, we pass by her novels in silence, with this remark only,  that people are accustomed to place the 'Comte de Comminges,' written  by Madame de Tencin, on the same footing with the 'Princess de Cleve,'  by Madame de Lafayette.    The society in the house of Madame de Tencin consisted of well-known  men of learning, and some younger men of distinguished name and  family; she united, in later years, a certain amiability with her  care for the entertainment and recreation of those whom she had once  received into her house. This society, after the death of De Tencin,  assembled in the house of Geoffrin. It appears, however, that Madame  de Tencin, as well as the whole fashionable world to which she  belonged, could never altogether disavow their contempt for science,  if indeed it be true, that she was accustomed to call her society  by the indecent by-name of her menagerie. Fontenelle, Montesquieu,  Mairan, Helvetius who was then quite young and present rather as a  hearer than a speaker, Marivaux and Astruc, formed the nucleus of this  clever society and led the conversation. Marmontel, who was not well  suited to this society, in which more real knowledge and a deeper  train of thought was called for than he possessed, informs us what  the tone of this society was, and speaks of their hunting after lively  conceits and brilliant flashes of wit, in a somewhat contemptuous  manner. Marmontel, however, himself admits, that he was only once in  the society, and that in order to read his 'Aristomenes,' and that  greater simplicity and good humor prevailed there than in the house of  Madame Geoffrin, in which he was properly at home.    Madame de Tencin's influence upon the new literature of the opposition  party, or rather upon the spirit of the age, may be best judged of  from the fact, that she largely contributed to the first preparation  and favorable reception of Montesquieu's \"Spirit of Laws.\" It is  certain, at least, that she bought a large number of copies and  distributed them amongst her friends. Madame Geoffrin went further;  the society which had previously met at Madame de Tencin's, no sooner  held their reunions in her house, than she drew together the whole  literary and the fashionable world, foreign ministers, noblemen and  princes who were on their travels, etc. Marmontel also says, that the  aged Madame de Tencin had guessed quite correctly the intentions of  Madame Geoffrin, when she said, that she merely came to her house so  often in order to see what part of her inventory she could afterward  make useful.    Madame Geoffrin became celebrated all over Europe, merely by devoting  a portion of her income and of her time to the reception of clever  society. She had neither the knowledge, the mind, nor the humility of  Madame de Tencin, which the latter at least affected toward the close  of her life; she was cold, egotistical, calculating, and brought  into her circle nothing more than order, tact and female delicacy.  Geoffrin also assumed the tone of high life, which always treats men  of learning, poets and artists, as if they were mantua-makers or  hair-dressers; and which must ever value social tact and the tone  which is only to be acquired in good society, higher than all studies  and arts upon which any one possessed of these properties is in a  condition to pass judgment without having spent any time in their  investigation. Marmontel is therefore honest enough to admit that he  and his friends, as well as Madame Geoffrin herself, were accustomed  to make a full parade when foreign princes, ministers, and celebrated  men or women dined at the house. On such occasions especially, Madame  Geoffrin displayed all the charms of her mind, and called to us, \"now  let us be agreeable.\"    Geoffrin's house was the first school of _bon ton_ in Europe:  Stanislaus Poniatowsky, even after he became King of Poland, addressed  her by the tender name of mother, invited her to Warsaw, and received  her as a personage of high distinction. All the German courts  which followed the fashion, paid correspondents in order to be made  acquainted with the trifles which occupied that circle. Catherine II.  had no sooner mounted the throne than she began to pay a commissioner  at this literary court, and even Maria Theresa distinguished Madame  Geoffrin in a remarkable manner, on her return from Poland. Besides,  we are made acquainted by Marmontel, who ranked his hostess among the  gods of this earth, with the anxiety and cautiousness of this lady of  the world, who afterward broke altogether with the chiefs of the new  literature, and most humbly did homage to the old faith, because she  had never wholly forsaken her old prejudices.    The able writers of the time were used by Geoffrin only as means to  promote her objects, to gain a reputation for splendor, and to glorify  France. The King of Prussia sought her society, in order to refresh  and cheer his mind when he was worn out with the cares and toils of  government.    Madame Geoffrin opened her house regularly on Mondays for artists,  and on Wednesdays for men of learning; but as she neither understood  the arts nor sciences, she took part in the conversation only so far  as she could do so without exposing her weak side. She understood  admirably how to attract the great men to her house, to whose houses  she herself very seldom went; and as long as the appearance of  fashionable infidelity and of scoffing, which was then the mode in the  higher circles, was necessary to this object, she carefully concealed  her real religious opinions.    The weak Marmontel, who, according to his own description, was  only fitted for superficial conversation and writing, boasts of the  prudence, foresight and skill of his protectress, and shows how she  understood the way to gain the confidence of others without ever  yielding her own. This distinguished art made the house of Madame  Geoffrin invaluable to the great world, and to those learned men  who wished to shine in this kind of society, and to cultivate and  avail themselves of it, for such people must learn above all things  neither to say too much nor too little. This society, indeed, was not  calculated for any length of time for a Rousseau or a Diderot. Even  the great admirers of Geoffrin admit that _savoir vivre_ was her  highest knowledge, she had very few ideas with respect to anything  besides; but in the knowledge of all that pertained to the manners and  usage of good society, in the knowledge of men, and particularly of  women, she was deeply learned, and was able to give some very useful"]]]
