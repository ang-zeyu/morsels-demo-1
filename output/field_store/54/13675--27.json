And the perfect morning, so fresh and fair,  basking in the light, as though laughing at its own beauty, seemed to  whisper, \"Why not?\"    But now he was out of the water Jonathan turned blue with cold. He ached  all over; it was as though some one was wringing the blood out of him.  And stalking up the beach, shivering, all his muscles tight, he too felt  his bathe was spoilt. He'd stayed in too long.      Chapter 1.III.    Beryl was alone in the living-room when Stanley appeared, wearing a blue  serge suit, a stiff collar and a spotted tie. He looked almost uncannily  clean and brushed; he was going to town for the day. Dropping into his  chair, he pulled out his watch and put it beside his plate.    \"I've just got twenty-five minutes,\" he said. \"You might go and see if  the porridge is ready, Beryl?\"    \"Mother's just gone for it,\" said Beryl. She sat down at the table and  poured out his tea.    \"Thanks!\" Stanley took a sip. \"Hallo!\" he said in an astonished voice,  \"you've forgotten the sugar.\"    \"Oh, sorry!\" But even then Beryl didn't help him; she pushed the basin  across. What did this mean? As Stanley helped himself his blue  eyes widened; they seemed to quiver. He shot a quick glance at his  sister-in-law and leaned back.    \"Nothing wrong, is there?\" he asked carelessly, fingering his collar.    Beryl's head was bent; she turned her plate in her fingers.    \"Nothing,\" said her light voice. Then she too looked up, and smiled at  Stanley. \"Why should there be?\"    \"O-oh! No reason at all as far as I know. I thought you seemed rather--\"    At that moment the door opened and the three little girls appeared, each  carrying a porridge plate. They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and  knickers; their brown legs were bare, and each had her hair plaited  and pinned up in what was called a horse's tail. Behind them came Mrs.  Fairfield with the tray.    \"Carefully, children,\" she warned. But they were taking the very  greatest care. They loved being allowed to carry things. \"Have you said  good morning to your father?\"    \"Yes, grandma.\" They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley  and Beryl.    \"Good morning, Stanley!\" Old Mrs. Fairfield gave him his plate.    \"Morning, mother! How's the boy?\"    \"Splendid! He only woke up once last night. What a perfect morning!\" The  old woman paused, her hand on the loaf of bread, to gaze out of the  open door into the garden. The sea sounded. Through the wide-open  window streamed the sun on to the yellow varnished walls and bare floor.  Everything on the table flashed and glittered. In the middle there was  an old salad bowl filled with yellow and red nasturtiums. She smiled,  and a look of deep content shone in her eyes.    \"You might cut me a slice of that bread, mother,\" said Stanley. \"I've  only twelve and a half minutes before the coach passes. Has anyone given  my shoes to the servant girl?\"    \"Yes, they're ready for you.\" Mrs. Fairfield was quite unruffled.    \"Oh, Kezia! Why are you such a messy child!\" cried Beryl despairingly.    \"Me, Aunt Beryl?\" Kezia stared at her. What had she done now? She had  only dug a river down the middle of her porridge, filled it, and was  eating the banks away. But she did that every single morning, and no one  had said a word up till now.    \"Why can't you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie?\" How  unfair grown-ups are!    \"But Lottie always makes a floating island, don't you, Lottie?\"    \"I don't,\" said Isabel smartly. \"I just sprinkle mine with sugar and put  on the milk and finish it. Only babies play with their food.\"    Stanley pushed back his chair and got up.    \"Would you get me those shoes, mother? And, Beryl, if you've finished,  I wish you'd cut down to the gate and stop the coach. Run in to your  mother, Isabel, and ask her where my bowler hat's been put. Wait a  minute--have you children been playing with my stick?\"    \"No, father!\"    \"But I put it here.\" Stanley began to bluster. \"I remember distinctly  putting it in this corner. Now, who's had it? There's no time to lose.  Look sharp! The stick's got to be found.\"    Even Alice, the servant-girl, was drawn into the chase. \"You haven't  been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance?\"    Stanley dashed into the bedroom where Linda was lying. \"Most  extraordinary thing. I can't keep a single possession to myself. They've  made away with my stick, now!\"    \"Stick, dear? What stick?\" Linda's vagueness on these occasions could  not be real, Stanley decided. Would nobody sympathize with him?    \"Coach! Coach, Stanley!\" Beryl's voice cried from the gate.    Stanley waved his arm to Linda. \"No time to say good-bye!\" he cried. And  he meant that as a punishment to her.    He snatched his bowler hat, dashed out of the house, and swung down the  garden path. Yes, the coach was there waiting, and Beryl, leaning over  the open gate, was laughing up at somebody or other just as if nothing  had happened. The heartlessness of women! The way they took it for  granted it was your job to slave away for them while they didn't even  take the trouble to see that your walking-stick wasn't lost. Kelly  trailed his whip across the horses.    \"Good-bye, Stanley,\" called Beryl, sweetly and gaily. It was easy enough  to say good-bye! And there she stood, idle, shading her eyes with her  hand. The worst of it was Stanley had to shout good-bye too, for the  sake of appearances. Then he saw her turn, give a little skip and run  back to the house. She was glad to be rid of him!    Yes, she was thankful. Into the living-room she ran and called \"He's  gone!\" Linda cried from her room: \"Beryl! Has Stanley gone?\" Old Mrs.  Fairfield appeared, carrying the boy in his little flannel coatee.    \"Gone?\"    \"Gone!\"    Oh, the relief, the difference it made to have the man out of the house.  Their very voices were changed as they called to one another; they  sounded warm and loving and as if they shared a secret. Beryl went over  to the table. \"Have another cup of tea, mother. It's still hot.\" She  wanted, somehow, to celebrate the fact that they could do what they  liked now. There was no man to disturb them; the whole perfect day was  theirs.    \"No, thank you, child,\" said old Mrs. Fairfield, but the way at that  moment she tossed the boy up and said \"a-goos-a-goos-a-ga!\" to him  meant that she felt the same. The little girls ran into the paddock like  chickens let out of a coop.    Even Alice, the servant-girl, washing up the dishes in the kitchen,  caught the infection and used the precious tank water in a perfectly  reckless fashion.    \"Oh, these men!\" said she, and she plunged the teapot into the bowl and  held it under the water even after it had stopped bubbling, as if it too  was a man and drowning was too good for them.      Chapter 1.IV.    \"Wait for me, Isa-bel! Kezia, wait for me!\"    There was poor little Lottie, left behind again, because she found it so  fearfully hard to get over the stile by herself. When she stood on the  first step her knees began to wobble; she grasped the post. Then you had  to put one leg over. But which leg? She never could decide. And when she  did finally put one leg over with a sort of stamp of despair--then the  feeling was awful. She was half in the paddock still and half in the  tussock grass. She clutched the post desperately and lifted up her  voice. \"Wait for me!\"    \"No, don't you wait for her, Kezia!\" said Isabel. \"She's such a little  silly. She's always making a fuss. Come on!\" And she tugged Kezia's  jersey. \"You can use my bucket if you come with me,\" she said kindly.  \"It's bigger than yours.\" But Kezia couldn't leave Lottie all by  herself. She ran back to her. By this time Lottie was very red in the  face and breathing heavily.    \"Here, put your other foot over,\" said Kezia.    \"Where?\"    Lottie looked down at Kezia as if from a mountain height.    \"Here where my hand is.\" Kezia patted the place.    \"Oh, there do you mean!\" Lottie gave a deep sigh and put the second foot  over.    \"Now--sort of turn round and sit down and slide,\" said Kezia.    \"But there's nothing to sit down on, Kezia,\" said Lottie.    She managed it at last, and once it was over she shook herself and began  to beam.    \"I'm getting better at climbing over stiles, aren't I, Kezia?\"    Lottie's was a very hopeful nature.    The pink and the blue sunbonnet followed Isabel's bright red sunbonnet  up that sliding, slipping hill. At the top they paused to decide where  to go and to have a good stare at who was there already. Seen from  behind, standing against the skyline, gesticulating largely with their  spades, they looked like minute puzzled explorers.    The whole family of Samuel Josephs was there already with their  lady-help, who sat on a camp-stool and kept order with a whistle that  she wore tied round her neck, and a small cane with which she directed  operations. The Samuel Josephs never played by themselves or managed  their own game. If they did, it ended in the boys pouring water down  the girls' necks or the girls trying to put little black crabs into the  boys' pockets. So Mrs. S. J. and the poor lady-help drew up what she  called a \"brogramme\" every morning to keep them \"abused and out of  bischief.\" It was all competitions or races or round games. Everything  began with a piercing blast of the lady-help's whistle and ended with  another. There were even prizes--large, rather dirty paper parcels which  the lady-help with a sour little smile drew out of a bulging string  kit. The Samuel Josephs fought fearfully for the prizes and cheated and  pinched one another's arms--they were all expert pinchers. The only time  the Burnell children ever played with them Kezia had got a prize,  and when she undid three bits of paper she found a very small rusty  button-hook. She couldn't understand why they made such a fuss....    But they never played with the Samuel Josephs now or even went to their  parties. The Samuel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#2)"],[1,"part of  the earth, so far as we know, has been inhabited by man during the  five or six thousand years in which Europeans have been storing up  their knowledge, and all that time the inhabitants of each part, of  course, were acquainted with that particular part: the Kamtschatkans  knew Kamtschatka, the Greenlanders, Greenland; the various tribes of  North American Indians knew, at any rate, that part of America over  which they wandered, long before Columbus, as we say, \"discovered\"  it.    Very often these savages not only know their own country, but can  express their knowledge in maps of very remarkable accuracy. Cortes  traversed over 1000 miles through Central America, guided only by  a calico map of a local cacique. An Eskimo named Kalliherey drew  out, from his own knowledge of the coast between Smith Channel  and Cape York, a map of it, varying only in minute details from  the Admiralty chart. A native of Tahiti, named Tupaia, drew out  for Cook a map of the Pacific, extending over forty-five degrees  of longitude (nearly 3000 miles), giving the relative size and  position of the main islands over that huge tract of ocean. Almost  all geographical discoveries by Europeans have, in like manner,  been brought about by means of guides, who necessarily knew the  country which their European masters wished to \"discover.\"    What, therefore, we mean by the history of geographical discovery is  the gradual bringing to the knowledge of the nations of civilisation  surrounding the Mediterranean Sea the vast tracts of land extending  in all directions from it. There are mainly two divisions of this  history--the discovery of the Old World and that of the New, including  Australia under the latter term. Though we speak of geographical  discovery, it is really the discovery of new tribes of men that  we are thinking of. It is only quite recently that men have sought  for knowledge about lands, apart from the men who inhabit them.  One might almost say that the history of geographical discovery,  properly so called, begins with Captain Cook, the motive of whose  voyages was purely scientific curiosity. But before his time men  wanted to know one another for two chief reasons: they wanted to  conquer, or they wanted to trade; or perhaps we could reduce the  motives to one--they wanted to conquer, because they wanted to  trade. In our own day we have seen a remarkable mixture of all three  motives, resulting in the European partition of Africa--perhaps the  most remarkable event of the latter end of the nineteenth century.  Speke and Burton, Livingstone and Stanley, investigated the interior  from love of adventure and of knowledge; then came the great chartered  trading companies; and, finally, the governments to which these  belong have assumed responsibility for the territories thus made  known to the civilised world. Within forty years the map of Africa,  which was practically a blank in the interior, and, as will be  shown, was better known in 1680 than in 1850, has been filled up  almost completely by researches due to motives of conquest, of  trade, or of scientific curiosity.    In its earlier stages, then, the history of geographical discovery  is mainly a history of conquest, and what we shall have to do will  be to give a short history of the ancient world, from the point  of view of how that world became known. \"Became known to whom?\"  you may ask; and we must determine that question first. We might,  of course, take the earliest geographical work known to us--the  tenth chapter of Genesis--and work out how the rest of the world  became known to the Israelites when they became part of the Roman  Empire; but in history all roads lead to Rome or away from it,  and it is more useful for every purpose to take Rome as our  centre-point. Yet Rome only came in as the heir of earlier empires  that spread the knowledge of the earth and man by conquest long  before Rome was of importance; and even when the Romans were the  masters of all this vast inheritance, they had not themselves the  ability to record the geographical knowledge thus acquired, and it  is to a Greek named Ptolemy, a professor of the great university  of Alexandria, to whom we owe our knowledge of how much the ancient  world knew of the earth. It will be convenient to determine this  first, and afterwards to sketch rapidly the course of historical  events which led to the knowledge which Ptolemy records.    In the Middle Ages, much of this knowledge, like all other, was  lost, and we shall have to record how knowledge was replaced by  imagination and theory. The true inheritors of Greek science during  that period were the Arabs, and the few additions to real geographical  knowledge at that time were due to them, except in so far as commercial  travellers and pilgrims brought a more intimate knowledge of Asia  to the West.    The discovery of America forms the beginning of a new period, both  in modern history and in modern geography. In the four hundred  years that have elapsed since then, more than twice as much of  the inhabited globe has become known to civilised man than in the  preceding four thousand years. The result is that, except for a few  patches of Africa, South America, and round the Poles, man knows  roughly what are the physical resources of the world he inhabits,  and, except for minor details, the history of geographical discovery  is practically at an end.    Besides its interest as a record of war and adventure, this history  gives the successive stages by which modern men have been made what  they are. The longest known countries and peoples have, on the whole,  had the deepest influence in the forming of the civilised character.  Nor is the practical utility of this study less important. The way  in which the world has been discovered determines now-a-days the  world's history. The great problems of the twentieth century will  have immediate relation to the discoveries of America, of Africa,  and of Australia. In all these problems, Englishmen will have most  to say and to do, and the history of geographical discovery is,  therefore, of immediate and immense interest to Englishmen.    [_Authorities:_ Cooley, _History of Maritime and Inland Discoveries_,  3 vols., 1831; Vivien de Saint Martin, _Histoire de la Geographie_,  1873.]          CHAPTER I    THE WORLD AS KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS    Before telling how the ancients got to know that part of the world  with which they finally became acquainted when the Roman Empire  was at its greatest extent, it is as well to get some idea of the  successive stages of their knowledge, leaving for the next chapter  the story of how that knowledge was obtained. As in most branches of  organised knowledge, it is to the Greeks that we owe our acquaintance  with ancient views of this subject. In the early stages they possibly  learned something from the Phoenicians, who were the great traders  and sailors of antiquity, and who coasted along the Mediterranean,  ventured through the Straits of Gibraltar, and traded with the  British Isles, which they visited for the tin found in Cornwall. It  is even said that one of their admirals, at the command of Necho,  king of Egypt, circumnavigated Africa, for Herodotus reports that  on the homeward voyage the sun set in the sea on the right hand.  But the Phoenicians kept their geographical knowledge to themselves  as a trade secret, and the Greeks learned but little from them.    The first glimpse that we have of the notions which the Greeks  possessed of the shape and the inhabitants of the earth is afforded  by the poems passing under the name of HOMER. These poems show an  intimate knowledge of Northern Greece and of the western coasts of  Asia Minor, some acquaintance with Egypt, Cyprus, and Sicily; but  all the rest, even of the Eastern Mediterranean, is only vaguely  conceived by their author. Where he does not know he imagines,  and some of his imaginings have had a most important influence  upon the progress of geographical knowledge. Thus he conceives of  the world as being a sort of flat shield, with an extremely wide  river surrounding it, known as Ocean. The centre of this shield  was at Delphi, which was regarded as the \"navel\" of the inhabited  world. According to Hesiod, who is but little later than Homer, up  in the far north were placed a people known as the _Hyperboreani_, or  those who dwelt at the back of the north wind; whilst a corresponding  place in the south was taken by the Abyssinians. All these four  conceptions had an important influence upon the views that men had  of the world up to times comparatively recent. Homer also mentioned  the pigmies as living in Africa. These were regarded as fabulous,  till they were re-discovered by Dr. Schweinfurth and Mr. Stanley  in our own time.    It is probably from the Babylonians that the Greeks obtained the  idea of an all-encircling ocean. Inhabitants of Mesopotamia would  find themselves reaching the ocean in almost any direction in which  they travelled, either the Caspian, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean,  or the Persian Gulf. Accordingly, the oldest map of the world which  has been found is one accompanying a cuneiform inscription, and  representing the plain of Mesopotamia with the Euphrates flowing  through it, and the whole surrounded by two concentric circles,  which are named briny waters. Outside these, however, are seven  detached islets, possibly representing the seven zones or climates  into which the world was divided according to the ideas of the  Babylonians, though afterwards they resorted to the ordinary four  cardinal points. What was roughly true of Babylonia did not in  any way answer to the geographical position of Greece, and it is  therefore probable that in the first place they obtained their  ideas of the surrounding ocean from the Babylonians.
