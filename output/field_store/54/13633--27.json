Then it will  twist about like a snake!\"    \"Land ob massy!\" cried Eradicate.    \"What can we do to help you?\" called Mr. Swift. \"Shall I run and shut  off the power?\" for in the shop where Tom did most of his inventive  work there was a powerful dynamo, and it was on one of the wires  extending from it, that brought current into the house, that the craft  had caught.    \"Yes, shut it off if you can!\" Tom shouted back. \"But be careful. Don't  get shocked! Wow! I got a touch of it myself that time!\" and he could  be seen to writhe in his seat.    \"Oh, hurry! hurry! Find Koku!\" cried Mr. Swift to Mr. Damon, who had  started for the power house on the run.    The sparks and lances of fire seemed to increase around the young  inventor. The airship could be seen to slip slowly down the sloping  roof.    \"Land ob massy! He am suah gwine t' fall!\" yelled Eradicate.    \"Oh, he'll never get that current shut off in time!\" murmured Mr.  Swift, as he started after Mr. Damon.    \"Wait! I think I have a plan!\" called Mr. Peterson. \"I think I can save  Tom!\"    He did not waste further time in talk, but, running to a nearby shed,  he got a long ladder that he saw standing under it. With this over his  shoulder he retraced his steps to the balloon hangar and placed the  ladder against the side. Then he started to climb up.    \"What are you going to do?\" yelled Tom, leaning over from his seat to  watch the elderly fortune-hunter.    \"I'm going to cut that wire!\" was the answer.    \"Don't! If you touch it you'll be shocked to death! I may be able to  get out of here. So far I've only had light shocks, but the insulation  is burning out of my magneto, and that will soon stop. When it does I  can't run the motor, and--\"    \"I'm going to cut that wire!\" again shouted Mr. Peterson.    \"But you can't, without pliers and rubber gloves!\" yelled Tom.  \"Keep  away, I tell you!\"    The man on the ladder hesitated. Evidently he had not thought of the  necessity of protecting his hands by rubber covering, in order that the  electricity might be made harmless. He backed down to the ground.    \"I saw a pair of old gloves in the shed!\" he cried. \"I'll get  them--they look like rubber.\"    \"They are!\" cried Tom, remembering now that he had been putting up a  new wire that day, and had left his rubber gloves there.  \"But you  haven't any pliers!\" the lad went. \"How can you cut wire without them?  There's a pair in the shop, but--\"    \"Heah dey be! Heah dey be!\" cried Eradicate, as he produced a heavy  pair from his pocket. \"I--I couldn't find de can-opener fo' Mrs.  Baggert, an' I jest got yo' pliers, Massa Tom. Oh, how glad I is dat I  did. Here's de pincers, Massa Peterson.\"    He handed them to the fortune-hunter, who came running back with the  rubber gloves. Mr. Damon was no more than half way to the power house,  which was quite a distance from the Swift homestead. Meanwhile Tom's  airship was slipping more and more, and a thick, pungent smoke now  surrounded it, coming from the burning insulation. The sparks and  electrical flames were worse than ever.    \"Just a moment now, and I'll have you safe!\" cried the fortune-hunter,  as he again mounted the ladder. Luckily the charged wire was near  enough to be reached by going nearly to the top of the ladder.    Holding the pincers in his rubber-gloved hands, the old man quickly  snipped the wire. There was a flash of sparks as the copper conductor  was severed, and then the shower of sparks about Tom's airship ceased.    In another second he had turned on full power, the propellers whizzed  with the quickness of light, and he rose in the air, off the shed roof,  the live wire no longer entangling him. Then he made a short circuit of  the work-shop yard, and came to the ground safely a little distance  from the balloon hangar.    \"Saved! Tom is saved!\" cried Mr. Swift, who had seen the act of Mr.  Peterson from a distance. \"He saved my boy's life!\"    \"Thanks, Mr. Peterson!\" exclaimed the young inventor, as he left his  seat and walked up to the fortune-hunter. \"You certainly did me a good  turn then. It was touch and go! I couldn't have stayed there many  seconds longer. Next time I'll know better than to fly with a wireless  trailer over a live conductor,\" and he held out his hand to Mr.  Peterson.    \"I'm glad I could help you, Tom,\" spoke the other, warmly. \"I was  afraid that if you had to wait until they shut off the power it would  be too late.\"    \"It would--it would--er--I feel--I--\"    Tom's voice trailed off into a whisper and he swayed on his feet.    \"Cotch him!\" cried Eradicate. \"Cotch him! Massa Tom's hurt!\" and only  just in time did Mr. Peterson clutch the young inventor in his arms.  For Tom, white of face, had fallen back in a dead faint.          CHAPTER II    \"WE'LL TAKE A CHANCE!\"      \"Carry him into the house!\" cried Mr. Swift, as he came running to  where Mr. Peterson was loosening Tom's collar.    \"Git a doctor!\" murmured Eradicate. \"Call someone on de tellifoam! Git  fo' doctors!\"    \"We must get him into the house first,\" declared Mr. Damon, who, seeing  that Tom was off the shed roof, had stopped mid-way to the powerhouse,  and retraced his steps. \"Let's carry him into the house. Bless my  pocketbook! but he must have been shocked worse than he thought.\"    They lifted the inert form of our hero and walked toward the mansion  with him, Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, standing in the doorway in  dismay, uncertain what to do.    And while Tom is being cared for I will take just a moment to tell my  new readers something more about him and his inventions, as they have  been related in the previous books of this series.    The first volume was called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle,\" and this  machine was the means of his becoming acquainted with Mr. Wakefield  Damon, the odd gentleman who so often blessed things. On his  motor-cycle Tom had many adventures.    The lad was of an inventive mind, as was his father, and in the  succeeding books of the series, which you will find named in detail  elsewhere, I related how Tom got a motorboat, made an airship, and  later a submarine, in all of which craft he had strenuous times and  adventures.    His electric runabout was quite the fastest car on the road, and when  he sent his wonderful wireless message he saved himself and others from  Earthquake Island. He solved the secret of the diamond makers, and,  though he lost a fine balloon in the caves of ice, he soon had another  air craft--a regular sky-racer. His electric rifle saved a party from  the red pygmies in Elephant Land, and in his air glider he found the  platinum treasure. With his wizard camera, Tom took wonderful moving  pictures, and in the volume immediately preceding this present one,  called \"Tom Swift and His Great Searchlight,\" I had the pleasure of  telling you how the lad captured the smugglers who were working against  Uncle Sam over the border.    Tom, as you will see, had, with the help of his father, perfected many  wonderful inventions. The lad lived with his aged parent, his mother  being dead, in the village of Shopton, in New York State.    While the house, which was presided over by the motherly Mrs. Baggert,  was large, it was almost lost now amid the many buildings surrounding  it, from balloon and airship hangars, to shops where varied work was  carried on. For Tom did most of his labor himself, of course with men  to help him at the heavier tasks. Occasionally he had to call on  outside shops.    In the household, beside his father, himself and Mrs. Baggert, was  Eradicate Sampson, an aged colored man-of-all-work, who said he was  called \"Eradicate\" because he eradicated dirt. There was also Koku, a  veritable giant, one of two brothers whom Tom had brought with him from  Giant Land, when he escaped from captivity there, as related in the  book of that name.    Mr. Damon was, with Ned Newton, Tom's chum, the warmest friend of the  family, and was often at Tom's home, coming from the neighboring town  of Waterford, where he lived.    Tom had been back some time now from working for the government in  detecting the smugglers, but, as you may well suppose, he had not been  idle. Inventing a number of small things, including useful articles for  the house, was a sort of recreation for him, but his mind was busy on  one great scheme, which I will tell you about in due time.    Among other things he had just perfected a new style of magneto for one  of his airships. The magneto, as you know, is a sort of small dynamo,  that supplies the necessary spark to the cylinder, to explode the  mixture of air and gasoline vapor. He was trying out this magneto in  the Humming Bird when the accident I have related in the first chapter  occurred.    \"There! He's coming to!\" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert, as she leaned over  Tom, who was stretched out on the sofa in the library. \"Give him  another smell of this ammonia,\" she went on, handing the bottle to Mr.  Swift.    \"No--no,\" faintly murmured Tom, opening his eyes. \"I--I've had enough  of that, if you please! I'm all right.\"    \"Are you sure, Tom?\" asked his father. \"Aren't you hurt anywhere?\"    \"Not a bit, Dad! It was foolish of me to go off that way; but I  couldn't seem to help it. It all got black in front of me, and--well, I  just keeled over.\"    \"I should say you did,\" spoke Mr. Peterson.    \"An' ef he hadn't a-been there to cotch yo' all,\" put in Eradicate,  \"yo' all suah would hab hit de ground mighty hard.\"    \"That's two services he did for me today,\" said Tom, as he managed to  sit up. \"Cutting that wire--well, it saved my life, that's certain.\"    \"I believe you, Tom,\" said Mr. Swift, solemnly, and he held out his  hand to his old mining partner.    \"Do you need the doctor?\" asked Mr. Damon, who was at the telephone.  \"He says he'll come right over--I can get him in Tom's electric  runabout, if you say so. He's on the wire now.\"    \"No, I don't need him,\" replied the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1," sex. The first  sketches the main outlines of a complex emotional state which is of  fundamental importance in sexual psychology; the second, by bringing  together evidence from widely different regions, suggests a tentative  explanation of facts that are still imperfectly known; the third attempts  to show that even in fields where we assume our knowledge to be adequate a  broader view of the phenomena teaches us to suspend judgment and to adopt  a more cautious attitude. So far as they go, these studies are complete in  themselves; their special use, as an introduction to a more comprehensive  analysis of sexual phenomena, is that they bring before us, under varying  aspects, a characteristic which, though often ignored, is of the first  importance in obtaining a clear understanding of the facts: the tendency  of the sexual impulse to appear in a spontaneous and to some extent  periodic manner, affecting women differently from men. This is a tendency  which, later, I hope to make still more apparent, for it has practical and  social, as well as psychological, implications. Here--and more especially  in the study of those spontaneous solitary manifestations which I call  auto-erotic--I have attempted to clear the ground, and to indicate the  main lines along which the progress of our knowledge in these fields may  best be attained.    It may surprise many medical readers that in the third and longest study I  have said little, save incidentally, either of treatment or prevention.  The omission of such considerations at this stage is intentional. It may  safely be said that in no other field of human activity is so vast an  amount of strenuous didactic morality founded on so slender a basis of  facts. In most other departments of life we at least make a pretence of  learning before we presume to teach; in the field of sex we content  ourselves with the smallest and vaguest minimum of information, often  ostentatiously second-hand, usually unreliable. I wish to emphasize the  fact that before we can safely talk either of curing or preventing these  manifestations we must know a great deal more than we know at present  regarding their distribution, etiology, and symptomatology; and we must  exercise the same coolness and caution as--if our work is to be  fruitful--we require in any other field of serious study. We must approach  these facts as physicians, it is true, but also as psychologists,  primarily concerned to find out the workings of such manifestations in  fairly healthy and normal people. If we found a divorce-court judge  writing a treatise on marriage we should smile. But it is equally absurd  for the physician, so long as his knowledge is confined to disease, to  write regarding sex at large; valuable as the facts he brings forward may  be, he can never be in a position to generalize concerning them. And to  me, at all events, it seems that we have had more than enough pictures of  gross sexual perversity, whether furnished by the asylum or the brothel.  They are only really instructive when they are seen in their proper  perspective as the rare and ultimate extremes of a chain of phenomena  which we may more profitably study nearer home.    Yet, although we are, on every hand, surrounded by the normal  manifestations of sex, conscious or unconscious, these manifestations are  extremely difficult to observe, and, in those cases in which we are best  able to observe them, it frequently happens that we are unable to make any  use of our knowledge. Moreover, even when we have obtained our data, the  difficulties--at all events, for an English investigator--are by no means  overcome. He may take for granted that any serious and precise study of  the sexual instinct will not meet with general approval; his work will be  misunderstood; his motives will be called in question; among those for  whom he is chiefly working he will find indifference. Indeed, the pioneer  in this field may well count himself happy if he meets with nothing worse  than indifference. Hence it is that the present volume will not be  published in England, but that, availing myself of the generous sympathy  with which my work has been received in America, I have sought the wider  medical and scientific audience of the United States. In matters of faith,  \"liberty of prophesying\" was centuries since eloquently vindicated for  Englishmen; the liberty of investigating facts is still called in  question, under one pretence or another, and to seek out the most vital  facts of life is still in England a perilous task.    I desire most heartily to thank the numerous friends and correspondents,  some living in remote parts of the world, who have freely assisted me in  my work with valuable information and personal histories. To Mr. F.H.  Perry-Coste I owe an appendix which is by far the most elaborate attempt  yet made to find evidence of periodicity in the spontaneous sexual  manifestations of sleep; my debts to various medical and other  correspondents are duly stated in the text. To many women friends and  correspondents I may here express my gratitude for the manner in which  they have furnished me with intimate personal records, and for the  cross-examination to which they have allowed me to subject them. I may  already say here, what I shall have occasion to say more emphatically in  subsequent volumes, that without the assistance I have received from women  of fine intelligence and high character my work would be impossible. I  regret that I cannot make my thanks more specific.    HAVELOCK ELLIS.          CONTENTS.      THE EVOLUTION OF MODESTY.    I.
